"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has told Senate Democrats that he's willing to stay away from election battles where his presence would not be helpful, a Democratic source said -- an apparent nod to his poll numbers. Obama's comments came when he and former President Bill Clinton attended the Senate Democrats' issues conference at Nationals Park on Wednesday. Sources at the meeting said Obama assured Democrats that maintaining control of the Senate is his top priority this year. ""I don't remember him (Obama) saying he wouldn't be offended if he wasn't invited (to help campaign), but he certainly acknowledged how low his numbers are in certain states,"" a source told CNN. But Obama also noted ""they are bad in some states overall,"" and ""that certain people would need him to help in certain parts of those states,"" that source said. According to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted last weekend, Obama's approval rating stood at 45%, with his disapproval at 50%. Those numbers are slightly better than two months before, when the approval ratings ran at or near all-time lows for the President. But it's still far below where it stood a year ago, at his second inaugural, when his approval rating stood in the low to mid 50s in most polling. With a number of vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election this year, sources at Wednesday's meeting said Obama vowed to do what he could to support Democratic candidates. The Democratic caucus currently holds a 55-45 majority in the 100-member chamber, but 21 Democratic-controlled seats are up this year as opposed to only 15 Republican seats. Making matters worse for Democrats is the consensus view that the overwhelming majority of vulnerable seats are currently held by Democrats. The meeting served as a question-and-answer opportunity between Senate Democrats and the President. Some Democrats up for re-election asked Obama questions, but they focused on substantive topics, largely avoiding politics, according to one source. ""There was amazingly little politics, virtually no politics,"" said that source, who called the meeting ""positive"" and ""not defensive"" on anyone's part. Read more about Wednesday's meeting between Obama, Clinton and Senate Democrats . A number of Democratic senators facing tough re-elections this year seem to be anything but excited to have the President join them on the campaign trail. Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat from red-state Alaska who faces a challenging bid for second term in the Senate, told CNN last week that ""I'm not really interested in campaigning"" with Obama if the President came to Alaska, he said. It was a similar story from Sen. Mark Udall. The Colorado Democrat is also up for re-election, but his seat isn't considered that vulnerable as of now. In an interview with CNN last week, Udall refused to say whether he'd like some help on the campaign trail if the President comes to Colorado, a purple state that Obama won in both the 2008 and 2012. ""We'll see what the President's schedule is, what my schedule is. But Coloradans are going to re-elect me based on my record, not the President's record,"" Democratic Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana both have made news in the recent months by not appearing with Obama when he's held an event in their state. Both face challenging re-election campaigns in GOP friendly states. Republicans are highlighting such instances as proof that Obama is toxic for vulnerable Democrats in red or purple states.

"(CNN) -- Arsenal gained revenge over Liverpool for their humiliating defeat last weekend with a 2-1 victory in a pulsating English FA Cup fifth round tie at the Emirates Sunday. Humbled 5-1 in the English Premier League eight days ago, Arsenal restored pride and stayed on course for a first trophy since an FA Cup triumph in 2005. Goals in each half from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and German international Lukas Podolski gave Arsenal a two-goal cushion before a Liverpool fightback. Podolski tripped Luis Suarez to concede a penalty at the other end, which visiting captain Steven Gerrard converted. Liverpool, who had failed to convert earlier chances, with Daniel Sturridge the worst culprit, pushed forward in search of an equalizer and might have earned a second penalty moments later. Oxlade-Chamberlain made a rash challenge on Suarez, but referee Howard Webb ignored strong claims for the spot kick. The hard-fought victory has earned Arsenal a home tie in the quarterfinals against Everton, who beat Swansea 3-2 earlier Sunday in an all-EPL clash. It will also boost morale ahead of a last 16 Champions League clash against Bayern Munich Wednesday, having been eliminated by the German giants in Europe's premier club competition last season. Manager Arsene Wenger also hit back at a jibe from Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who had called him a ""specialist in failure"" in reference to Arsenal's long trophy drought. ""I do not want to go into that - those were silly, disrespectful remarks,"" Wenger said when asked about Mourinho's remarks. ""I know one thing, it is more embarrassing for Chelsea than it is for me."" In the other FA Cup tie played Sunday, third flight Sheffield United beat Nottingham Forest 3-1 to reach the last eight. They could face city rivals Sheffield Wednesday, who still have to play Charlton in a postponed fifth round tie, for a place in the semifinals. In Italy's Serie A, champions Juventus maintained their relentless march towards another title with a 3-1 win over Chievo in Turin. It left them nine points clear of second-placed Roma, who kept pace with a 3-0 win over Sampdoria later Sunday. Kwadwo Asamoah rounded off a one-two with Fernando Llorente to put Juve ahead after 17 minutes with Claudio Marchisio adding a second on the half hour mark. Martin Caceres put the ball past his own goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon to give Chievo some hope before Llorente headed a fine third soon afterwards to restore the two-goal cushion. Third-placed Napoli stretched their lead over Fiorentina to six points with a 2-0 away win at struggling Sassuolo with goals from Blerim Dzemaili and Lorenzo Insigne. Fiorentina lost 2-1 to fifth placed Inter Milan Saturday.","Arsenal beat Liverpool in English FA Cup fifth round tie .

"(CNN) -- Bobbie Smith, who as a member of the Spinners sang lead on such hits as ""I'll Be Around"" and ""Could It Be I'm Falling in Love,"" has died. He was 76. Smith died Saturday of complications of pneumonia and the H1N1 flu virus, according to a statement from Nat Burgess, the Spinners' manager. The Spinners were one of the longest-lived bands in pop music, with the core of the group having formed in the 1950s. Three members of the group -- Smith, Willy Henderson and Pervis Jackson -- met in a Detroit-area high school, and were later joined by Henry Fambrough and C.P. Spencer. It was Smith who came up with the name, he told Gary James of classicbands.com. ""All my life I loved cars,"" he said. People ""would round off the front, the hood or change the grille. They would lower 'em in the back. They called 'em bubble skirts and in the front they would have these big chrome hub caps. Cadillac hubcaps, and they called 'em spinners. So that's how we got the name ... from a hubcap."" The group was signed to a small local label, Tri-Phi, by R&B legend Harvey Fuqua and his soon-to-be wife, Gwen Gordy. Tri-Phi was later taken over by Motown, owned by Gordy's brother, Berry. An early hit, ""That's What Girls Are Made For,"" featured Smith on lead vocals. But the Spinners never found their niche at Motown, often working around the office while other male vocal groups on the label -- including the Four Tops, the Temptations and the Miracles -- went on to major success. ""When we were at Motown and we had a hit, we wouldn't get another record released for another year. So now you're playing catch-up,"" Smith told James. ""When you get a hit, you gotta keep popping 'em out there, you know. And so, we felt like we got lost in the shuffle at Motown."" Musicians knew who they were, though, thanks to the group's showmanship. In the liner notes to ""The Chrome Collection,"" a 2003 boxed set, David Bowie credits the group with the best show he ever saw. Even a Stevie Wonder-produced 1970 hit, ""It's a Shame,"" didn't help the group at Motown, which had by then assigned them to a minor subsidiary called VIP. The label let them go not long after. Thanks to advice from fan Aretha Franklin, the Spinners soon got another chance, with Atlantic Records. More importantly, in Thom Bell they had a producer who catered to their musical strengths. Bell was also responsible for arranging or producing a huge number of songs at the Philadelphia International label, owned by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. ""His way of producing was top of the line,"" Henderson told CNN in 2003. (Henderson died in 2007.) ""With Bell, everything was designed for us."" For the next several years, it was hit after hit: ""I'll be Around,"" ""One of a Kind (Love Affair),"" ""Then Came You"" (with Dionne Warwick), ""The Rubberband Man,"" and ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love."" Smith split the lead vocal duties with Philippe Wynne. ""We had always been promised (by Motown) that, 'This is your year,' "" Henderson recalled. Atlantic ""moved us into a new circle."" Critics agreed. ""The Spinners were the greatest soul group of the early '70s, creating a body of work that defined the lush, seductive sound of Philly soul,"" wrote Stephen Thomas Erlewine on Allmusic.com. Despite occasional changes, the band was remarkably long-lived. After Wynne left the band in 1977 (he died in 1984), various combinations of Smith, Henderson, Jackson, Fambrough and ""It's a Shame"" vocalist G.C. Cameron toured with the Spinners into the early 2000s. Overall, the band had seven top 10 singles and five gold albums. The Spinners were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999 and have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Smith was diagnosed with lung cancer last November, according to the statement. Among his final requests was ""to make people aware of his cancer, so as to once again bring to the forefront the many dangers of smoking.""

"(CNN) -- Two men accused of murdering an Irish teacher on her honeymoon last year pleaded not guilty when they appeared in court in Mauritius on Tuesday, police on the Indian Ocean island said. Michaela Harte-McAreavey, 27, was strangled in her hotel room in January 2011, just days after her wedding. Her widower, John McAreavey, has returned to Mauritius for the trial in the capital city, Port Louis. Family friends in Ireland said he had to battle through crowds outside the building to attend the Supreme Court hearing. Police in Mauritius say the accused -- hotel workers Avinash Treebhoowoon, 30, and Sandip Moneea, 42 -- pleaded not guilty to premeditated killing. Local media say that as the case involves the killing of a tourist, there's intense interest in Mauritius, and dozens of people crammed into the small courtroom for the hearing. Suspect in Irish newlywed death to appear in court . A jury of six men and three women was selected, and proceedings were then adjourned for the day, police said. Officers believe the newlywed was killed after interrupting a burglary as she returned to her hotel room. She was the daughter of one of Ireland's best-known sporting figures, Gaelic football manager Mickey Harte, and was a winner of the Ulster Rose of Tralee beauty pageant title. Her widower has played Gaelic football at its highest level. Police say John McAreavey is scheduled to be among more than 30 witnesses expected to give evidence. His sister Claire McAreavey read a statement to media outside the court on behalf of the McAreavey and Harte families, appealing for privacy during the trial. ""This is a very distressing time for both our families, and the days ahead will be very difficult for us,"" she said. ""We hope that the media will understand that we are anxious that nothing will be said or done that will compromise or prejudice the due process during the trial."" She added that the families would not be making any further statements during the trial, which is expected to last for three weeks.","Michaela Harte-McAreavey, 27, was strangled in January 2011 just days after her wedding .

"(CNN) -- Sitting in the first lady's box listening to the President Barack Obama push for movement on immigration reform, Cristian Avila no longer had to keep his head down and live in fear of being deported. While the President dedicated only a brief part of his State of the Union address to immigration, his message went beyond his speech, and the evidence was sitting among the guests invited to join the first lady in the viewing box. ""I feel honored and excited to be here. If it wasn't for receiving my DACA last summer I wouldn't have been able to attend the State of the Union,"" Avila told CNN. The 23-year-old and his siblings are just one of the many thousands of recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Avila was illegally brought into the United States with his younger brother and sister when he was 9 years old . DACA is a government program enacted in 2012 that stopped deporting some undocumented young people and instead granted them temporary work authorization and a two-year reprieve from deportation. Obama hits the road to push State of the Union message . The recipients have become one of the most visible groups advocating for immigration reform. Avila caught the attention of the Obama administration during his 22-day fast on the National Mall in support of immigration reform last November. And, for the last two years, Avila's been working as a voter engagement coordinator for Mi Familia Vota, a non-profit Latino civic engagement program. ""At the time, immigration reform seemed like it was dead. We won the hearts of the American people. We revived the conversation,"" Avila said. Obama pleaded for cooperation and pointed out how getting immigration reform done this year was important for the country's recovering economy. ""If we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement -- and fix our broken immigration system,"" Obama said. Without attacking House Republicans, the President described how both parties in the Senate passed a comprehensive bill last summer and said both parties in the House want to do the same. He said immigration reform would not only help the economy but shrink the deficit by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades. ""When people come here to fulfill their dreams -- to study, invent, contribute to our culture -- they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everybody. So let's get immigration reform done this year,"" he said. Obama spoke of immigration reform in broad strokes but that might have something to do with the plans of House Republican leaders to outline their principles for immigration reform at a party meeting this week. Opinion: Can Obama deliver action on inequality? ""We're going to outline our standards, principles of immigration reform and have a conversation with members,"" House Speaker John Boehner said during a news conference after a party meeting. Obama steered clear of specific immigration reform policies. There was no mention of stopping the deportations of undocumented immigrants without criminal records, despite countless pleas from activists all over the country. Avila and his siblings no longer live in fear of being deported but his parents face that threat every time they leave their homes for work. ""I grew up with the fear of being deported. My mom would always tell me to put my head down,"" Avila said. ""I still have the constant fear of my parents being deported. They are fearful and targeted even though they earn their living in an honest way,"" said Avila, ""One of the reasons that I keep strong is for them."" Still, Avila remains optimistic that immigration reform will happen in 2014. ""We are closer than ever before. It shouldn't take any longer,"" Avila said.","Sitting in the first lady's box was DREAMer Cristian Avila .

"(CNN) -- Facebook took a colorful turn this week, when its female users began posting cryptic status updates. ""Beige,"" ""sexy black and gold,"" ""crimson red,"" ""turquoise,"" ""nude with a lot of padding,"" read some. The color scheme has left male users scratching their heads and asking ""Huh?"" So, what is behind the trend? It's all part of an effort to raise awareness for breast cancer by asking women to post the color of the bra they're wearing. Female Facebookers started catching on this week as a message made its rounds through the inboxes of the social media network. ""We are playing a game for Breast Cancer Awareness,"" one form of the message read. ""Write the color of your bra as your status -- just the color, nothing else!! Copy this and pass it on to all girls -- NO MEN!! This will be fun to see how it spreads."" By Friday, all the colors of the Victoria's Secret rainbow were present in users' news feeds when they logged in. A spokeswoman for Facebook said it's not clear where or how the message started, calling it an example of a grass-roots movement beginning on the social networking site. ""What is particularly unique about this grass-roots campaign is that it seems to have been started by a user or group of users, as opposed to an official entity, and spread virally throughout Facebook,"" Facebook's Malorie Lucich said. ""It's an ideal example of how an individual voice can be magnified to create awareness for a good cause and ignite action among millions by using a site like Facebook."" Breast cancer groups say they are happy that the disease, which affects more than 200,000 women in the United States a year, is getting attention. ""It's not one of our campaigns, but we're all for it,"" said Andrea Rader, a spokeswoman for Susan G. Komen for the Cure. ""Just about anything that raises this issue in a positive, fun way is just terrific."" Lucich said hundreds, if not thousands, of users were posting their color choices directly to the Susan G. Komen and Breast Cancer Awareness Facebook pages. Rader encouraged women to take the trend one step further by visiting the Komen Web site and getting more information about ways to raise awareness. Meanwhile, some tech blogs were calling the color string the new ""25 Things,"" a meme -- Internet speak for a concept or catchphrase that spreads quickly on the Web -- that went viral in early 2009. Users were asked to post notes with random tidbits about themselves and then ""tag"" other users to do the same. The ""25 Things"" note was virtually unavoidable for a three-week period as users passed it on, sort of like a modern-day chain letter. It's unclear whether the color meme will have the same popularity if half of Facebook's 350 million active users can't participate.","Women post color of bra they're wearing in effort to boost cancer awareness .

"(CNN) -- Until this week, Utah had 24 state symbols, from tree (the blue spruce) to insect (the honeybee) to even cooking pot (the Dutch oven). Now it's added an official state firearm -- the John M. Browning-designed M1911 pistol, becoming the first state in the nation to have one, according to the state legislator who sponsored the law. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert signed the new symbol into law this week. State Rep. Carl Wimmer, a Republican who was a police officer and SWAT team commander, came up with the idea for a state firearm last year after hearing about how Pennsylvania lawmakers wanted to make the Pennsylvania long rifle its official state firearm, Wimmer told CNN on Friday. That measure eventually failed, he said. Wimmer selected the semi-automatic M1911 because gun maker Browning was born and raised in Ogden, Utah, and was the son of Utah pioneers who crossed the plains in the 1800s, Wimmer said. This year is also the 100th anniversary of when the U.S. military chose the M1911 to be its standard-issue sidearm for all branches of service, Wimmer said. That's how the pistol got its name: ""M"" for military and 1911 for the year that the military began issuing the gun to all its servicemen and women, Wimmer said. In a state more known for its strong Mormon traditions and breathtaking national parks, the creation of an official state firearm raised controversy, especially when the measure was pursued even after January's mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, that killed six persons and wounded 13 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The bill was introduced just before the horrific shootings, Wimmer said. ""People say the timing is terrible, and I admit the timing is terrible,"" Wimmer said. ""We have a part-time legislature in Utah, and we are only in session for 45 days. Certainly meaning no disrespect to the tragedy in Arizona, we moved forward in doing this because it's the only opportunity that we had."" Other critics have said the new state symbol implicitly condones gun violence. ""There was more controversy than I anticipated, but it really passed with bipartisan support,"" Wimmer said. ""One of the biggest comments from the critics was that we should not honor an implement of death. And my response to that has always been that this firearm does not represent an implement of death. It represents an implement of freedom -- just the mere fact that our soldiers have used this firearm to defend liberty and freedom around the world for the last 100 years."" The governor's office played down the lethality of the new symbol and focused more on its creator. ""This bill isn't so much about a weapon as it is about honoring John Moses Browning, who was a Utah inventor and entrepreneur, and he repeatedly gave back to the state,"" said the governor's spokeswoman, Ally Isom. The governor's office and both chambers of the legislature are controlled by Republicans. The M1911 had been the standard issue in the military until about 15 years ago, when the Beretta 9mm became its common sidearm because it holds 15 rounds and the M1911 only eight, Wimmer said. However, the M1911 is still used by elite units like Delta Force, Wimmer said. ""I thought how appropriate that we honor John Moses Browning on the 100th anniversary of the U.S. military's adoption of the M1911 as their official pistol,"" Wimmer said. ""The list of firearms that he invented is too exhaustive for me to go into,"" Wimmer added about Browning. Wimmer owns a Browning-designed M1911, he said. ""Almost every military weapon that is currently in use today has one point or another been modeled after a Browning firearm,"" Wimmer said. Wimmer, 35, is now considering running for Utah's fourth congressional seat, newly created after the latest census, he said. He was a SWAT commander, canine patrol officer and sex crimes detective in South Jordan, Utah, for seven years and then a patrol officer in West Valley City, Utah, for four years, he said. He left the police force to serve in the state legislature and is now a partner in the security consulting firm Corporate Task Force in Riverton City, Utah, where he lives. Addressing other critics who say he's merely seeking publicity for his possible congressional run, Wimmer responded: ""People will second-guess everything I do and say everything I do is because of the congressional race, and it's simply not true.""","Utah's official state firearm is the John M. Browning-designed M1911 pistol .
The designation of a lethal weapon has created controversy .
The legislation's sponsor says the semi-automatic gun was a military standard for decades .
State Rep. Carl Wimmer denies he's seeking publicity for a congressional run ."
"(CNN) -- Brazilian striker Neymar marked his El Clasico debut with a goal as Barcelona beat Real Madrid 2-1 at the Nou Camp on Saturday to consolidate their lead at the top of La Liga. Neymar, who joined the Catalan club for â‚¬57 million ($78 million) in the summer, opened the scoring in the 18th minute, side-footing a low right-foot shot past Diego Lopez after being played in by Iniesta. Despite fielding world-record signing Gareth Bale alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Real couldn't find a route though a well-organized Barcelona defense. Ronaldo went close in the 58th minute -- his low right-foot shot forcing a smart save from Victor Valdes -- and Karim Benzema (who replaced Gareth Bale in the 61st minute) hit the woodwork in the 72nd minute with a sweetly struck shot from 20 yards. But it was Gerardo Martino's team who delivered the killer blow seven minutes from time as substitute Alexis Sanchez scored with a delightful chip over Lopez. Jese Rodriguez pulled one back for Madrid in the 90th minute but it couldn't stop Barcelona winning a first league match over their arch rivals since December 2011. The win sends Barca four points clear at the the top of the league with nine wins and a draw from their opening ten games. Defeat keeps Real Madrid in third place with 22 points. Second-placed Atletico Madrid can move five points clear of their city rivals with a win over Real Betis on Sunday evening. Elsewhere, Malaga's miserable run of form continued with a crushing 5-0 home defeat to Celta Vigo. The visitors were a goal up after six minutes thanks to a long-range shot from Alex Lopez before Argentine international Augusto Fernandez doubled the lead in the 23rd minute. Lopez bagged his second in the 64th minute with Nolito adding Celta's fourth in the 73rd minute. Brazilian striker Charles completed the rout with a fifth nine minutes from time. In the remaining two La Liga fixtures, Levante moved up to seventh after beating Espanyol 3-0 and Granada rise to 11th place after beating Elche 1-0.","Brazilian forward Neymar marks El Clasico debut with a goal .

"(CNN) -- Last Saturday morning, when media crews outside the Sikh gurdwara (house of worship) in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, packed up their trucks to chase the news of Mitt Romney's choice for vice president, Sikh Americans were left reflecting on six days of unprecedented national attention. After the shooting of six people in a Sikh gurdwara, a stream of national leaders, from the Rev. Jesse Jackson to Gov. Scott Walker, came to offer condolences and support. But there was one person missing. It was you, Mr. President. Let me be clear: Your administration's response to the massacre has been strong and swift. Attorney General Eric Holder addressed mourners with compassion and resolve at the Friday memorial.: ""In the recent past, too many Sikhs have been targeted and victimized simply because of who they are, how they look, and what they believe,"" he said.. ""This is wrong. It is unacceptable. And it will not be tolerated."" Joshua Dubois from the White House expressed his full commitment to helping us with sustained interfaith and education outreach. The FBI and Department of Justice were at the top of their game, investigating the attacks as both an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime. But we need more than government cooperation. Our community needs the deeper spiritual and emotional assurance that we are welcome to live, work and worship as fellow Americans. The gunman, Wade Michael Page, was a member of a white supremacist group that wishes to destroy our very claim to call this country home. After the attack we endured, Sikh Americans, and all brown and black people in America for that matter, need our president to directly show the nation that we belong here. Watch: Volunteers help temple mourners cope . President Obama, you flew to Aurora, Colorado, to mourn publicly with the families before the dead were buried. You hugged your daughters closer that night, imagining them in that theater. In response to the massacre of Sikhs in Oak Creek, you and Mitt Romney issued statements of support, but did not suspend campaigning in Wisconsin, as you did in Colorado. Of the major networks, only CNN sent an anchor to report live from Oak Creek, and none of the networks covered the murders as extensively as they did in Colorado. We worry that because the victims were brown-skinned people with ""foreign"" names, the tragedy hasn't elicited the same attention from public officials and the media. I believe you can help the nation feel our pain. You can show this tragedy is an American tragedy, because none of us should have to fear gunfire in their own churches, synagogues and mosques. If Trayvon Martin could have been your son, and the kids in the Aurora theater your daughters, then the aunts and uncles shot while praying on that Sunday could have also been your own. We wish you were there on Thursday morning when community members entered their gurdwara for the first time since the massacre. You would have witnessed the spirit of chardi kala in the Sikh faith -- even in darkness, a rising resilience -- and shared this spirit, which is also part of the American character. Sikh women and men walked into a crime scene: blood on the carpets, there were bullet holes in the walls, and shattered windows. They flew into action, ripping out carpets, painting over bullet holes, scrubbing floors, and within hours, they served the first langar (open meal), breaking bread beneath portraits of those who have died for our faith. Opinion: Why American Sikhs will survive . We wish you were there later that night for the town hall meeting organized by your Justice Department. Nearly every Sikh American told officials that the attack on Sunday was not isolated or ""senseless,"" but one in a long pattern of intentional acts of hate and discrimination in the last decade and long before. Our children are bullied in schools, our men and women are profiled at airports and barred from military service unless they give up their turbans, and our people endure racial slurs and hate crimes that are not specifically tracked by the FBI. You would have heard the community's cry for help and publicly called upon all Americans to recommit to curbing the alarming rise of hate and fear in this country. News: Holder calls Sikh temple shooting a hate crime . We wish you were there on Friday morning for the memorial for the dead. Three thousand people filled the Oak Creek High School gymnasium, a sea of people sitting in reverence and sorrow before six open caskets. We are deeply moved that you ordered the flags lowered to half-mast, an expression of respect and honor. But for Sikhs, and for Muslims who watched eight mosques attacked in eleven days, the threat is not over. ""All politics aside, a personal visit, even with the victims' families, the temple, the people, for [the president] to take pictures with people who have turbans and beards does so much for our safety,"" said Amardeep Kaleka, whose father was killed bravely fighting the gunman. I returned to New York this week. One cab driver pointed to his brown skin and said to me: ""This is not just about Sikh people. This is an attack on me too."" Belief: Sikh iReports speak to long-held fears in their community . President Obama, I believe you can help our nation find lasting lessons in Oak Creek. Now that we've had time to grieve, people who care are turning to one another and asking: What do we do now?

"(CNN) -- Talk about something to be grateful for this Thanksgiving. The American Samoa soccer team, ranked dead last among soccer teams around the world by FIFA, soccer's international governing body, made history this week when it won its first ever international game. That's cause for celebration for a team that for 16 years had never savored victory. A team that played 30 games since 1994, losing all 30. One that set a record for the largest loss in international soccer history, when Australia trounced it 30-1 in 2001. But all that changed Tuesday when it beat Tonga 2-1 in a pre-qualifying game for the 2014 World Cup. ""I hope that we can now improve our standing in the FIFA rankings and get into the hundreds,"" said coach Thomas Rongen to the country's football federation. ""We are 204 at the moment and this win will have helped."" Rongen, who until May coached the U.S. Under-20 team, was hired just three weeks ago. He told the Football Federation he wasn't even sure where the tiny U.S. protectorate in the South Pacific was located when he was approached for the job. ""I live in Florida and own some property in the Bahamas, so I'm an island kind of guy,"" he said. ""I looked at a map and said to my wife, 'Hey, it's an island. Do you want to do it?' She said, 'Let's go. So we headed down."" Soccer isn't a big draw in the island of about 55,000. And, Rongen said, the sport is a labor of love for the squad. ""They're not getting anything to be here and some are spending time away from their jobs and are losing money because of that,"" he said. ""It's amateur football at its best. The game at the highest level can be very cynical, but this is just about 23 guys making sacrifices,"" Rongen said.","The team is ranked 204th in FIFA soccer standings .
It made the record books when it lost to Australia 30-1 .
It lost 30 consecutive games before its win against Tonga ."
"(CNN) -- The U.S. men's hockey team lost any dream of an Olympic medal Saturday when Finland crushed them 5-0 in the consolation game for the bronze medal in the Sochi Games. The loss was a major American disappointment in one of the Olympics' marquee events, especially after the Americans earlier beat the Russians. Finland broke open the scoreless game in the second period, by scoring two successive goals in the opening minutes, embarrassing the Americans, who seemed uninspired. By the third period, the game was a blowout as the U.S. team was unable to find the goal. The Americans appeared Saturday to still be reeling from their loss this week to Canada, 1-0, which meant that the Americans would be relegated to playing for the bronze medal and the Canadian team advancing to Sunday's game for the gold. Americans entered the Olympics with high hopes -- and a quest to redeem themselves after their performance in the last Winter Games in Vancouver in 2010 when they lost the gold-medal game to Canada 3-2 in overtime and went home with a silver medal. In the Sochi Games, the U.S. team demonstrated early prowess when they beat the Czech Republic 5-2 and then archrival Russia 3-2. But the U.S. team then lost to Canada, which will play Sweden on Sunday. And then the Americans were shutout Saturday. The Fins seemed to score at will in the third period, racking up three goals. At least the U.S. women fared better in the Sochi Games. This week they took a silver medal after they lost the gold medal game to Canada in overtime, 3-2. The Olympics' hockey game has emerged as a sort of a world championship because many of hockey's top pros play in the Winter Games for their respective countries. As so, the Finnish team was loaded with National Hockey League talent, as was the American team. The Finnish team featured NHL players such as Anaheim's Teemu Selanne, Boston's Tuukka Rask and Dallas' Kari Lehtonen. The Fins were a formidable team entering the bronze medal game because their two losses came to the two finalists who will be playing in Sunday's gold medal game -- Canada and Sweden -- and because they knocked Russia out of the Games.","Finland shuts out the Americans by scoring two goals in 2nd period, three in 3rd period .

"(CNN) -- Australian woman Schapelle Corby has walked out of a prison in Bali, Indonesia, after being convicted almost nine years ago of drug smuggling. The 36-year-old was surrounded by a swarm of cameras and Australian network reporters to see her released on bail in a case that supporters say was a setup. Covered in a hat and rushed into a waiting bus by security forces, she will be taken to a parole office for further processing. Indonesian Justice Minister Amir Syamsuddin said Friday that Corby had been granted parole. He said Corby's parole review was one of more than 1,000 that had been completed. Corby, 36, was convicted in May 2005 for smuggling 9 pounds (4.1 kilograms) of marijuana in a bag while arriving at Bali's Denpasar International Airport the previous October. She has always maintained her innocence. Her lawyers argued the drugs were planted, possibly by airport employees involved in trafficking. But the court found her guilty and sentenced her to 20 years in prison. The punishment fueled anger in Australia, where many people said they felt Corby had been set up. After exhausting the appeals process, Corby applied for clemency. A medical exam diagnosed her as suffering from acute depression with psychotic symptoms. In 2012, Indonesia reduced her sentence by five years, laying the foundation for her parole application. Corby appears unlikely to return to Australia anytime soon, though. Australian media have reported that she will have to remain in Bali on parole until 2017. Some Indonesians have accused the authorities of giving Corby's case special attention. But the justice ministry says she's being treated the same way as other convicts in Indonesia.","Australian Schapelle Corby, 36, is set free from prison in Bali, Indonesia .

"(CNN)  -- Golfers everywhere beware! The knee problems that left Tiger Woods on the sidelines and threaten his bid to overtake Jack Nicklaus as the all-time majors winner are not solely the preserve of star players. If you are a middle-age golfer with an expanding waistline you too could be placing great strain on vulnerable joints. It seems Woods' left knee gave out because of the ""tremendous forces"" he exerts during his swing, according to leading U.S. orthopedic specialist Dr. Nicholas A. DiNubile MD. He has treated many leading athletes during his career, including NBA star Allen Iverson and is the best-selling author of ""FrameWork - Your 7 Step Program for Healthy Muscles, Bones & Joints."" ""Dr Nick has helped keep me keep me in one piece and that's no easy job,"" reads a personal testimony from former Philadelphia 76ers star on the surgeon's official website. But the bulk of DiNubile's day-to-day work involves treating less impressive physical specimens than the likes of Woods and Iverson, and middle age golfers are among his biggest clients. ""I see perhaps three to six per day and I tell most of them they could do with dropping a few pounds,"" he told CNN. ""Every pound you are carrying equates to between five to eight in terms of pressure on the knee during a golf swing,"" he revealed. The good news for the average hacker is that they are unlikely to suffer such a drastic injury as that suffered by 14-time major winner Woods. He tore his Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) in 2008 and further problems  flared up this year to sideline him from the U.S. and British Opens. DiNubile believes the former world number one can get back to his best, but warned: ""The knee is never quite the same when your tear the ACL."" A birds'-eye view of how an ACL tear is fixed . And that is where Tiger and the high handicappers have something in common because DiNubile believes that arthritis is a factor ""unavoidable after ACL surgery however perfect the procedure."" A common injury problem among golfers who have played for a number of years, other than lower back issues, is the tearing of the meniscus in the knee. Meniscus are shock absorbers and once they are damaged, the dreaded arthritis creeps in. With proper treatment, a good fitness program and shedding a few pounds, golfing careers can be extended, but DiNubile warns that arthritis ""goes through phases when it calms down, then out of the blue it comes back at you."" DiNubile was a special advisor to the president's council on physical fitness and sports in the first Bush administration and helped former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger with his syndicated medical column. He has his own words of advice for Woods and other golfers suffering from a similar knee problem. ""Stay fit, lay off running, weights are great and there are joint supplements that help, as well as lubricants we can inject (into the knee) that tame arthritis a little."" Woods returned to action last month after an 11-week layoff and before the tournament in Ohio told reporters he felt the ""fittest he's been in years."" The 35-year-old added: ""The great thing is I don't feel a thing, Woods said of his left leg. ""It feels solid, it feels stable, no pain. That's one of the reasons why I took as long as I did to come back is that I want to get to this point where I can go ahead and start playing golf again like this."" Physically fit again he may be, but Woods has struggled on the course, finishing down the field at his comeback event and missing the cut at this week's U.S. PGA Championship. DiNubile has no doubt he can still challenge in the majors, but like other golfers with knee problems believes it will be a limiting factor. ""I do think it will indeed change the potential of what he might have accomplished. It is a real issue,"" he concluded.","Leading U.S. orthopedic surgeon warns golfers about knee problems .

"(CNN) -- After all the doubts and fears, the Winter Olympics finally began on Thursday -- even if the sporting action did get underway ahead of the opening ceremony officially opening the Games. That has not happened since the Sarajevo Olympics of 1984 but this will matter little to Great Britain's Billy Morgan, who had the honor of being the first athlete to compete in Sochi. The snowboarder was competing in slopestyle, which is making its debut at this year's Games. The two other disciplines that took place on Thursday were the womens' moguls and the men's team figure skating. The latter event was also making its debut, in a bid to emulate the drama and emotion found in the Summer Olympics' gymnastics event, and was the highlight of the opening day for host nation Russia. All eyes were on Yevgeny Plushenko, who may be a three-time Olympic medalist but whose presence in Sochi was marked by controversy. Despite ruling himself out of contention for the Olympics, the 31-year-old was named as the only male figure skater in the Russian team ahead of younger colleagues, notably 18-year-old national champion Maxim Kovtun. Inside the Iceberg Skating Palace, the 2006 Olympic gold medalist wowed the locals with a glittering performance as he put his own concerns about his aging and aching body to one side to register a personal best of 91.39. ""After 12 surgeries on my body, that I can skate in a fourth Olympics is great,"" said Plushenko, who has undergone surgery on his spine and knees in recent years. ""When I came on the ice, everywhere everybody was screaming and shouting. I was a bit shocked. I felt kind of dizzy."" Lapped up by the partisan spectators, with tennis star Maria Sharapova among their number, the man nicknamed 'Zhenya' could only place second -- upstaged, perhaps ironically given the nature of his selection, by a teenager. Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu, 19, freely admits that Plushenko was his idol when growing up but he bettered his idol by some distance when scoring 97.98 points. ""Plushenko to me is a hero and it felt great just to take to the same ice as him,"" said Hanyu, whose Japan sit fourth in the ten-team field. Thanks to a fine display from Tatiana Volosozhar and Maxim Trankov, Russia finished the day in pole position, their 19 points two better than Canada with China sitting on 15. The ladies short program, the ice dance short dance and the pairs free skate final will take place on Saturday with men's and women's free skating and the team ice dance final on Sunday. In the slopestyle, Mark McMorris came into the games as one of Canada's brightest medal hopes but he failed to qualify automatically for Saturday's final and so must make it through the semifinals earlier that day. Despite breaking a rib two weeks ago, the 20-year-old refused to blame the injury for his poor performance. McMorris is one of nearly 3,000 athletes who will compete for 98 gold medals over the next 16 days, with athletes from 87 different countries taking part in Sochi. 'Harmony, Friendship and Mutual Respect' On Thursday, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed his hopes that the international event will overcome the negative vibes that have clouded its preparations. While security fears have dominated the international media because of simmering tensions in the nearby North Caucasus region of the country, where Islamic separatists have conducted a string of deadly attacks, a great deal of attention has also focused on Russia's anti-gay laws. ""I hope that this Olympics will be the venue where people, regardless of their sexual orientation, will really be able to enjoy harmony, friendship and mutual respect, and compete in the spirit of the Olympic movement,"" said the South Korean in his keynote address to the International Olympic Committee. ""That is what the Russian government is committed to, and that is what I am assured by President Putin."" ""I know principle six of the Olympic Charter enshrines the IOC's opposition to any form of discrimination,"" he added. Ban did not specifically address the situation in Russia, whose parliament passed a hugely controversial law banning the dissemination of ""gay propaganda"" to minors last year. The ruling prompted some to call for a boycott of the 2014 Games. On Friday, more than 24 hours after the first athletes competed, Sochi will officially start with an opening ceremony about which little is known. Tipped to feature a light show and music, organizers will be hoping that the inevitable fireworks are restricted to the sky -- and not to a games whose buildup has been anything but dazzling.","Action begins ahead of opening ceremony for first time in 30 years .

"(CNN) -- Resolving domestic disputes between elephants and humans is an age old problem, but one not-for-profit organization based in Zambia thinks it may have a solution. The Elephant Pepper Development Trust (EPDT) is encouraging local farmers to burn briquettes of chili to ward off the stomping giants. It's a technique that Loki Osborn, director of the EPDT, said is very effective given the elephant's delicate sense of smell. In an interview with CNN, he said: ""The hot chili peppers are very distasteful to elephants because of their advanced olfactory systems. They pick up things in the environment that we have no idea about."" ""Chilies really irritate them and cause a very short term, very painful experience for them that goes away,"" he added. But although the red hot chili peppers may cause some discomfort to the elephants in the short term, it is the lesser of two evils, notes Osborn. The longstanding conflict between farmers and elephants is devastating both sets of communities. Farmers sometimes kill elephants in an effort to protect their crops while the latter decimate food and grain stores, occasionally injuring or killing humans and livestock. What's more -- farmers are bearing the costs of living with elephants and receive little of the benefits, says the EPDT. Even where community-based conservation initiatives exist, and elephants generate large revenues, the money doesn't filter down to local population. Osborn said that creating an environment where people and elephants can live in harmony is key, but that doesn't necessarily mean taking a conventional approach to conservation. And that's where the chilies come in. ""The problem with conservation in general, it doesn't produce anything. There's not really much you can sell from conservation of birds in a forest,"" says Osborn. ""So we thought, if we could get people to grow these chilies to deter the elephants from coming into the fields, buy it back, grind it up and sell it internationally to tell the story about what we're doing but also give a high end market for African products -- maybe we could be a model for other programs."" The EPDT's work is more important than ever as elephant and human populations have significantly increased in southern Africa in recent years, explains Osborn. According to the World Wildlife Fund, elephant numbers have reached 300,000 in sub-Saharan Africa, however, less than 20% of the elephant range is under formal protection. And while tolerant of human disturbance to some degree, elephants are unable to survive when the landscape becomes dominated by farmland. Osborn said: ""The world wants to know more about where [our] food is coming from, so having a great story to it really was a powerful thing... I think our kids are going to be very much more interested in that kind of stuff than our generation is now."" The EPDT currently sells the farmed chilies through a website called 'Elephant Pepper' with a slogan: ""Elephants Hate Chili... We Love Elephants."" Osborn is hopeful that programs such as the one run by the EPDT will help to spur investment on a continent-wide scale and attract entrepreneurs, who want to set up businesses in the country rather than just provide revenue through aid. ""Africa needs the business minds of the people... to come and spend money here,"" he said, ""you can create 50 jobs without even blinking because labor is relatively cheap; you can have a labor intensive project."" Osborn, a Louisiana native, believes that entrepreneurs must move to Africa to make money and not purely for philanthropic reasons. ""We shouldn't come here with that attitude,"" he says. ""People need jobs here and they need jobs of reasonable pay... If your long term goal is to save these animals, there's got to be something far more creative than what we're currently doing.""","Farmers in Zambia using chili as relatively harmless way of stopping elephants from destroying crops .

"(CNN) -- North Korea's chief nuclear negotiator will meet senior Russian officials next week to discuss ending the embattled nation's nuclear program, Russia's foreign ministry said. The talks involving Kim Kye Gwan, North Korea's first deputy foreign minister, and Russian deputy foreign ministers Vladimir Titov and Igor Morgulov will take place Thursday, the ministry said in a statement, according to Russia's RIA Novosti news agency. The meeting is ""part of efforts to resume the six-party talks"" related to North Korea's controversial nuclear program, according to Russia's foreign ministry. Those talks involving officials from North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, the United States and Russia have been at a virtual standstill since last decade. Tensions in and around the Korean Peninsula escalated even further in the past year, particularly after Pyongyang launched a long-range rocket, then conducted an underground nuclear test two months later. North Korea, China want to resume nuclear talks . The international community widely criticized the moves, threatening yet more sanctions and punitive measures. And yet North Korea remained defiant -- even threatening to attack South Korea and the United States. But things have taken a turn in recent weeks. Earlier this month, North Korea proposed high-level talks with the United States to ""ease tensions in the Korean Peninsula,"" its state news agency reported. More recently, while Kim was in Beijing for bilateral talks, the North Korea official and China's Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesu both issued statements calling for the resumption of talks to ""peacefully solve nuclear issues through dialogue"" with all relevant parties.

"WEST MEMPHIS, Arkansas (CNN) -- They are known as the ""West Memphis Three"" -- young men who were arrested as teens and convicted of a triple killing with occult overtones that chills this working-class Mississippi River town to this day. Jessie Misskelley implicated his co-defendants and could be paroled someday. Defense attorneys for death row inmate Damien Echols say they have uncovered forensic evidence that could spare their client's life and help clear his co-defendants as well. In the spring of 1993, three 8-year-old boys were found murdered in a drainage ditch not far from their homes. Their hands and feet were tied with their shoelaces. And at the time it was thought to be an occult killing involving sexual abuse and mutilation.  Watch doubts cast in gruesome case » . A month after the bodies were found, three teenagers -- Echols, who was 18 at the time, Jessie Misskelley, then 17, and Jason Baldwin, then 16 -- were charged with the boys' murders. They were convicted a year later after a trial that featured testimony about satanic rituals and heavy metal music. Misskelley is the only one given a chance at parole. The case has long had its doubters, and it has been the subject of books and documentaries. The West Memphis Three have a following of celebrity activists. In court papers filed last week, attorneys for Echols stated that -- even with DNA testing unavailable in 1993 -- they have uncovered no forensic evidence tying the three to the murders of Christopher Byers, Steven Branch and James Michael Moore. But DNA that might belong to two other men was found in hairs found at the crime scene, the documents state. The slayings of the three Cub Scouts struck fear deep in the heart of a community, and some people say that fear led to a rush to arrest and convict. ""It was hysteria. Everyone was concerned. Everyone started bringing their children in,"" said Ron Lax, who has worked the case as a private investigator for the defense since 1993. ""They were convinced there were monsters loose, devil worshipers, Satanists,"" he recalled. ""It was like the community was relieved when the arrests were made because the big, bad boogeyman had been caught."" ""I'm not sure Perry Mason could have got those boys off,"" said Gerald Skahan, a member of Damien Echols' defense team. The convictions followed, in part, as a result of statements by Misskelley. The reliability of his words has long been called into question. Misskelley, who is ""borderline retarded,"" Lax said, ""had a very difficult time keeping the story straight -- even with the help of police."" Misskelley's father, Jessie Misskelley Sr., maintained police forced his son to make the confession. ""My son is innocent,"" he said. In their court papers, Echols' defense team pointed out that there is no physical evidence linking the three men convicted to the three boys slain. No hairs, no fibers, and not a shred of DNA. ""We are saying is that there's no credible evidence that links any of these defendants to the crime,"" said Dennis Riordan, San Francisco-based defense attorney. Riordan said a team of seven forensic scientists has reviewed the autopsy results, photographs and trial testimony. As part of a 200-plus page filing, the experts concluded there was no evidence of sexual abuse or any type of satanic killing. They also found that the injuries on the bodies of the boys -- which prosecutors called mutilation -- actually were caused by animals after the boys were killed. Echols'  lawyers maintained that it's not their job to solve the crime, only to show that their client wasn't involved. But the defense team said two hairs found at the crime scene could belong to one of the victim's stepfathers and the man's friend. ""The new DNA evidence is that one hair that was found in the ligature of the shoelaces that bound Michael Moore is consistent with the DNA of Terry Hobbs, who is the father of Stevie Branch,"" Lax told CNN. He continued: ""Another hair that had been found at the crime scene, which had been unidentified for all these years, has just recently been tested. And the DNA on that hair is consistent with the DNA of David Jacoby. David Jacoby is a good friend or was a good friend of Terry Hobbs, and Terry Hobbs was at his house just that afternoon and evening."" While David Jacoby did not return CNN's calls, Hobbs' attorney, Ross Sampson, told CNN it's possible his client's hair was found at the scene. ""It was naturally transferred; it was a child that lived with him,"" Sampson said. ""Mr. Hobbs had absolutely nothing to do with the death of his own stepson or the two other individuals in this matter,"" Sampson stated. Hobbs spoke with CNN. He said the new suspicions are hurtful to him. ""It's hard as a parent to live with the loss of your home, of your wife, your family and then to have your friends and neighbors look at you and think, 'Is there something else there?' That hurts,"" he said. State prosecutor Brent Davis would not comment on the case and his office referred calls to the Arkansas attorney general. ""While the State will look at the new allegations and evidence objectively, it stands behind the conviction of Mr. Echols and that of his codefendants and does not anticipate a reversal of the juries' verdicts,"" Gabe Holmstrom, spokesperson for Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, said in a written statement. West Memphis Police Chief Bob Paudert was not working in the town when the murders took place. But he didn't rule out further investigation. ""If we're told to look into it we will. If they have DNA evidence that would give evidence that these three did not commit that crime, I would want to see it absolutely. I'm the first to say that if they have evidence to free those three I would support it 100 percent."" In the meantime, Echols, Misskelley and Baldwin wait in jail, hoping to one day be free men. The families of the victims grieve. A town still hopes to some day recover. And new questions in this old case continue to go unanswered.

"(CNN) -- A suicide bomber blew up a booby-trapped car, killing three soldiers and wounding four others at an army checkpoint in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, according to the National News Agency (NNA).

"(CNN) -- With over 250 of the world's leading galleries on show and in excess of 50,000 attendees, Art Basel Miami Beach can make a legitimate claim to being America's leading art fair. Set against the city's neon buzz, the annual four-day event -- which comes to a wrap on Sunday -- is not just a big draw for the nation's art-lovers, but a stampede of fashionistas, style spotters and unrepentant party-lovers alike. No surprise then that here, the blurred line between art and fashion fades into obscurity, with this year's ABMB taking their ever-incestuous mingling to new heights. For instance, YBA star Tracy Emin has designed a limited edition range of t-shirts and sandals to run alongside her exhibition and, in his Miami boutique, Christian Louboutin exhibited five leather sculptures by Italian artist Caemelo Tedeschi. Meanwhile, Gap hosted a brunch to celebrate a limited edition collection of 45 t-shirts designed by artists like Yoko Ono. And Louis Vuitton hired Italian artisans to construct ""La maison au bord de l'eau""—a beach house, originally designed by French architect Charlotte Perriand in 1934. They then shipped it to a beach in Miami. ""Everyone in fashion is seeing Art Basel Miami Beach as an opportunity,"" says Lucie Greene, the editor of LS:N Global, the trends network at forecasting agency Future Laboratory. ""Fashion brands are collaborating with artists more than ever. By being present at major international art fairs like Art Basel, brands get face time with a high concentration of high net-worths who are all here to buy art."" And shoes, sunglasses and handbags. Miami-based shoe brand Del Toro has launched a pop-up store in collaboration with Italia Independent. Likewise Etnia Barcelona, the makers of eye wear for the jet-set, have released a range of sunglasses in Yves Klein blue inspired by the artist's archives. ""It really is a brand fest here—all the major events are branded and there are tie-ups and collaborations for everything,"" says Greene, who has been scouting art and design in Miami for several days. ""It has become such a hotspot for luxury brands and the art crowd,"" she added. Handbags and history . Art Basel Miami Beach is the most timely example of where art meets fashion, but the mingling of artists and designers is by no means a new phenomenon. Back in the early 20th century, for instance, the French couturier Paul Poiret employed graphic artists such as Paul Iribe and Erté to create textile prints for his creations. Between 1927 and 1954, the Italian fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli initiated the modern practice of collaborating with contemporary artists via her informal partnerships with Jean Cocteau, Salvador Dalí and Alberto Giacometti. Schiaparelli placed far less emphasis on the concept of 'collaboration' -- a 21st-century label—and she did not prominently credit her artists as is common practice now. But the publicity this work received, particularly the 'Lobster' dress designed with Salvador Dalí and later worn by Wallis Simpson, set the trend for future collaborations between contemporary artists and fashion houses. The level of collaboration has always varied, and it still does today. At a basic level, a house may employ an artist for the purpose of decorating its staple products, such as leather goods, accessories and fabrics. In more involved collaborations, they may invite an artist to alter a product's physical proportions, construction and style, or indeed imagine an entirely new product. But most collaborations merely involve a print that is sold or licensed for a negotiated price based on the status of the house and the size of the production, and then applied to the brand's existing products. Whatever the level of creative involvement on the part of the artist, such collaborations between art and fashion represent an important meeting of the two worlds. Museums around the world have celebrated this and other important collaborations. In 2012 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York staged ""Impossible Conversations,"" an exhibition that featured Schiaparelli's work alongside that of contemporary Italian designer Miuccia Prada, also known for her collaborations with visual artists. In 2010, MoMA PS1 in New York recognized the modern-day proliferation of fashion--art collaborations with ""Move!"", a series of performances and installations by fourteen pairs of designers and artists, including Marc Jacobs and Rob Pruitt, Cynthia Rowley and Olaf Breuning, and Proenza Schoulder and Dan Colen. Mutual benefit . The modern fashion industry is intensely profit driven. The fact that so many collaborative projects come to market indicates that luxury brands regard these initiatives as commercially viable. Collaboration with an artist almost always takes the form of a one-off capsule collection. From Brian Rea's 2012 illustrations for Marni t-shirts and bags to Damian Hirst's recent collection of scarfs for Alexander McQueen, limited edition collections have an aura of authenticity normally associated with works of art. Fashion consumers also equate exclusivity with luxury, and nothing is so desired as that which has sold out. The reception of Takashi Murakami's 2003 collection for Louis Vuitton -- one of the house's most commercially successful special projects to date -- indicates this desire from consumers for something 'extra'. This sense of added value makes them more collectable. ""You're not just buying Vuitton,"" says Greene of the Future Laboratory. ""You're buying a collectable piece which is connected to a specific year and will go up in value when sold as vintage."" The incorporation of visual art into a fashion item also adds an of-the-moment relevance that is especially important for historic luxury brands. It can bring an additional gravitas to functional product lines such as leather goods. Just as there is mutual benefit, there is also mutual risk. Fashion houses must invest money in an experimental collection that may not resonate with consumers. And the artists who collaborate with them risk being branded 'sellouts' by their colleagues in the art world. However, the potential for wider exposure is often worth the risk. There are also benefits for society at large. For many consumers, a collaborative fashion project is the their first introduction to a particular artist's work. It comes in a digestible form that -- unlike contemporary art -- does not require a strictly defined body of knowledge. It is open to anyone with the means to buy the products or the willingness to explore them via the media. In this way fashion collaborations widen public access to contemporary art and give them a cultural education via the cash register. Whether at Art Basel Miami Beach or a Paris catwalk, long may it continue. Milena Veselinovic contributed to this story .","Art Basel Miami Beach has become a fashion hotspot .

"(CNN) -- So New York thinks it's the most stylish city on the planet? Sure, the Big Apple was named top dog in the latest rankings of fashion capitals around the world, pushing Paris into second place, and London into third. But can you party in an abandoned Rothschild mansion in New York? Can you watch indie films in an antique Japanese pagoda? Can you chillax on the beach in the heart of the city? Nope? Well, mes amis, you can in Paris. Whatever the world's fashion dignitaries might say, the City of Light is much more than stripy t-shirts and the Eiffel Tower. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find a single Parisian jostling with the tourists atop that particular feat of architecture, says culture blogger Vanessa Grall. ""Paris doesn't have to be the crowded tourist city everybody thinks of,"" said the 29-year-old editor of messynessy.com, a website delving into the city's hidden artisan gems. ""The great thing about Paris is you can walk around quiet, very traditional neighborhoods that are like movie sets, and find these secret little pockets -- like a hilltop vineyard overlooking the city."" And when the sun goes down, you can continue exploring the city's sumptuous club scene -- if you know where to look. ""People who complain about Paris nightlife are people who don't get out much,"" said 28-year-old Arthur Mestrot who, along with 26-year-old Ruben Nataf, founded online city guide ""Ten Days in Paris."" ""I feel as though there's a real link between night clubs and art, the buildings are some of the most beautiful in the world. We have a much different clubbing culture than other European cities like London and Berlin -- it's smaller, more intimate."" Grall's top tip for discovering some of these tourist-free treasures? ""Rent an old 1960s scooter, you don't need a license, and it's the best way to take the side streets and get lost."" And when you've worked out how to find your way back again, here are a few more reasons why Paris is cooler -- if not always more fashionable -- than you think: . You can party in an abandoned Rothschild mansion . Or a World War Two bunker. Or a closed inner-city railway. In fact, if it's grand, vintage, and out-of-bounds, then event organizers ""We are the Oracle"" (WATO) will probably be holding an extravagant soirée somewhere inside. Expect ""Eyes Wide Shut"" style secrecy, decadent dining, and thumping tunes -- all inside the city's most magnificent derelict buildings. Thousands of baguette-toting, beret-wearing cyclists take over . As any hipster will tell you, retro is cool. Bikes are also cool. Artisan deli goods are definitely up there. So the ""Beret and Baguette"" cycle ride through the city, involving 1,000 people dressed in 1930s costumes, and culminating in a picnic in the park, ticks all the right boxes. Watch indie films in an antique Japanese pagoda . People who don't know, watch films in multiplex cinemas. People who do, watch them in a lavish 118-year-old Japanese pagoda. The extravagant La Pagode was built as a present from Le Bon Marché department store owner Monsieur Morin as a gift to his wife. Today, movie-goers can sip tea in the surrounding bamboo gardens before marveling at the elegant theater adorned with golden murals and chandeliers. French Riviera? Paris brings the beach to you . Let's be realistic, not everyone has pockets deep enough for a vacation in the south of France. Never fear, Paris has it covered, bringing 5,000 tons of sand and nearly 100 palm trees to the banks of the Seine each summer. Ok, so it's not quite the Mediterranean. But there's still volleyball, giant sprinklers, and live jazz -- and all within the heart of one of Europe's biggest cities. Go hunting for a secret underground river . But the Seine isn't Paris' only river. There's another secret stream flowing deep under the streets -- if you know where to look. Centuries ago the Bièvre river wound its way through the city, becoming a polluted dumping ground for businesses, eventually sealed-up in 1912. Today, walking tours follow plaques marking the hidden river route. You don't need to go to the Louvre to see amazing art . You could line up for three hours to get into the world's most visited museum. Or you could wander the city at leisure, taking in some of the most skilful street art in Europe. If you want to see more than just the usual Banksys or pixelated mosaic ""space invaders,"" then there are plenty of walking or cycling tours to give you an in-depth tour of Paris' more obscure murals.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Five militants set off a deadly car bomb and then stormed a guest house used by foreigners in Afghanistan's capital Friday, holding a number of people hostage during a standoff with police before one of them was shot dead and the four others blew themselves up, the country's deputy interior minister said. A girl was killed and a security guard was wounded in the explosion at the beginning of the attack, said Deputy Interior Minister Gen. Mohammad Ayoub Salangi. Everyone who had been held inside the building escaped unharmed, he said. The girl's name and information on her nationality weren't immediately available. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Sediq Sediqqi, said 20 foreign nationals were moved to a safe place during the attack. He said the target of the attack was Roots of Peace, a U.S.-based aid organization whose offices are in the building. The group works with people of war-torn communities ""to provide lasting economic opportunities,"" according to its Facebook page. ""Our guesthouse was under attack, but all our workers are safe,"" the organization's country director, Mohammad Sharif Osmani, told CNN. The Taliban claimed responsibility, with a spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, saying they attacked a location used by foreigners as a church and for converting Afghans to Christianity. The attack began when an unoccupied car containing a bomb exploded outside the building, the deputy interior minister said. As five militants stormed the guest house, police shot and killed one, he said. The four others held inside the five people -- three Americans, a Malaysian and a person from an unspecified African country -- as a standoff with police unfolded, he said. The Uzbek Embassy and offices of other organizations are located nearby, police said. The attack came three days after militants stormed an election commission office in Kabul. That led to a five-hour gunbattle with Afghan security services in which five people were killed -- two police officers, two election commission workers and a provincial council candidate, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry said. The Taliban, who also claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack, have vowed to use force to disrupt the planned April 5 presidential election. Last week, the Taliban also claimed responsibility for an attack on the Afghan capital's Serena Hotel in which a reporter for the Agence France-Presse news agency, his wife and two of his three children were killed. Five others were also killed. The hotel was hosting celebrations to mark the eve of the Persian New Year.

"(CNN) -- The body found in a Washington, D.C., park is that of a man who was suspected of abducting an 8-year-old girl, police said Tuesday. Relisha Rudd has been missing since March 1, when she was last seen with Kahlil Tatum, a 51-year-old janitor at the homeless shelter where Relisha lived. ""It appears the body has been dead for about 36 hours,"" D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier told reporters Tuesday, adding that the cause of death was suicide. Lanier said Tuesday she was ""hoping to finish the search of the park by the close of the day"" Wednesday. The search for Relisha intensified last week when authorities began combing Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens. The search was prompted by evidence that Tatum had spent time there after Relisha's disappearance. ""On March 2, we know that Mr. Tatum purchased, among other items, a carton of black, 42-gallon, self-tie contractor trash bags within the District of Columbia,"" Lanier said Thursday. ""Not long after that purchase, Mr. Tatum was in the area of the aquatic gardens for a period of time."" Lanier said after Relisha was last seen, Tatum continued to go to work and was seen around the capital several times between March 2 and March 20. Lanier said Relisha was not with Tatum in any of those sightings. Tatum had not been seen since March 20. Tatum was a janitor for the homeless shelter where Relisha's family had been staying, and it appears Tatum had permission to be with the girl. The case took on new urgency when police discovered the body of Tatum's wife, Andrea Denise Tatum, 51, at a suburban Maryland motel. That discovery prompted police to issue an Amber Alert for Relisha. The search for the girl has been extensive. Lanier told reporters Monday that ""hundreds of police officers and firefighter cadets"" had been pulled to help with the search, along with divers, underwater cameras, aerial surveillance, search dogs, and cadaver dogs. ""Our primary focus here was to find Relisha,"" Lanier said Monday. ""We're not finished. That search is continuing.""","The death of Kahlil Tatum, 51, was suicide, D.C. police chief says .

"(CNN) -- As the days drag on, tempers understandably begin to fray. For the relatives of those lost on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, frustrations mounted as criticism of the airline's handling of the crisis piles up. Those who have congregated in the Lido Hotel in Beijing, wearily trudging back time and again to official airline briefings where news trickles out, if at all, feel that not enough is being done to support relatives. On Thursday, news that might be the break that the families are waiting for was broadcast from the Southern search zone. As Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott briefed the Australian parliament that ""new and credible"" information had come to light that objects possibly from MH370 may have been spotted by satellites, relatives waiting in the Lido hotel filed into a conference room where a large TV was showing Chinese news. The mood was tense as they watched Abbott report the new findings, giving hope that the wait for definitive news might soon be over. An audible, heavy sigh punctuated the attentive atmosphere, giving voice to the frustrations that the families are enduring. Frustration of relatives boils over . Health concerns . A day earlier, tensions had been rising at the hotel in a room where briefings to update the relatives were held. Stress, a lack of sleep and -- in some cases -- old age are conspiring against those camped out in Beijing hotels, and health levels are wearing as thin as tempers. Several family members CNN talked to said they cannot sleep due to the anxious wait, and are getting sick. They bemoan the limited medical support that the airline is offering. ""Do you know how many family members got sick already here while waiting for the updates on the plane?"" a relative asked angrily at Wednesday's briefing. ""How exactly are you going to take care of these sick people?"" A Malaysia Airlines representative conceded that out of the 465 registered family members in Beijing, there are a number of cases of families reporting ill-health. Families from across China have come to the capital to be close at hand for any news of their loved ones, but have been placed in hotels far from the city center. An elderly man said at the briefing that he doesn't know where to find hospitals from his hotel and he feels dizzy. Beleaguered airline reps have pledged to make an effort to improve the situation. ""We might have flaws in our action here (accommodating the families), but our intention is definitely to take good care of them,"" a manager of Malaysia Airline's Asia Pacific Region told the briefing. Hotel a grim backdrop as relatives cling to hope . Lack of Malaysian government engagement . The victims' families also feel that they are not being given due attention by the Malaysian government. ""Why there are still no Malaysian government representatives willing to meet with us family members? Why?"" another man at a briefing Wednesday asked. ""Does the Malaysian ambassador really care about the feelings of the family members here? We are very disappointed."" Deeply disappointed by the lack of support and information, and frustrated by a lack of Malaysian government presence in Beijing, some family members are setting up a ""Passengers' Relatives Self-help Committee,"" and are inviting each family to bring one representative forward and will then vote on what to do next. When Malaysian officials finally arrived Friday morning, they greeted the families with a presentation on the flight route. Around 400 to 500 relatives attended, but this contact comes a full two weeks after plane went missing. Perhaps surprisingly, the assembled relatives listened to the already-known news calmly and quietly. Legal uncertainty . The limbo the families find themselves in is creating uncertainty about their rights and eligibility for compensation, with relatives taking the desperate step of asking the airline for advice on their legal standing. ""Right now, there are just two options, one is the passengers are alive, the other is that they are dead,"" one woman said at a briefing Tuesday. ""As an airline, you need to explain to all of us here what rules and conditions apply in either of these cases for us family members here, and what rights do we have in either cases. You have the responsibility to inform us that."" A ""special consolation payment"" of 31,000 yuan -- around $5,000 -- has been paid out to relatives of passengers and crew, China's official state media reported. The airline's CEO said Sunday that only ""immediate financial assistance"" was so far being given to the families. Lawyers say that this payment will not affect future claims for compensation. ""The $5,000 comfort money ... was made according to Provisions on the Emergency Response and Family Assistance Relating to Civil Aircraft Flight Accidents, and should not be considered as part of the compensation,"" Zhang Qihuai, a legal expert specializing in aviation, told CNN. ""We reserve our legal rights to sue,"" one relative told CNN. ""What they've done so far is so unpopular. At least no one in China is saying anything good about them. We have to definitely practice our own rights."" In any case, the unknown status of the aircraft and its passengers mean that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to claim compensation at this moment. ""It is not the right time to sue for compensation, because Malaysia Airlines has not come to conclusion that the airline was crashed or all passengers died. So it is impossible to file the case in court in China,"" Liu Xiaoyuan, a human rights lawyer, said. A prominent U.S. aviation lawyer, Floyd Wisner, told Australian media that the airline could face damage claims of ""half a billion dollars, or more."" Keeping faith . Despite the increasing likelihood that the wait is in vain, it's hard for these families, brought together through tragedy, to let go. There's a message board and a heart-shaped candlelight vigil set up inside the hotel's conference hall, where daily family briefings are held. The messages are plaintive, and deeply personal. ""Little Ling, why don't you call home?"" one reads. ""Mom and dad are waiting for you. The whole family's waiting for you."" LIVE: Latest updates on the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner .

"(CNN) -- Somber and brow beaten, Kolubah piles potato greens on top of his head and walks to the nearest market at 5am. Barefoot. He has to sell all of his greens to make money so his family can eat. His parents and siblings are unable to provide for themselves, so everyday Kolubah is forced to skip school and earn a living. His only solace: football. Later that same day Coach Tio kneels down to tie Kolubah's shoelaces. Kolubah is 10-years-old and the breadwinner for his family. But so rarely does he wear shoes, he doesn't even know how to tie his own laces. Tough childhoods . Tough childhoods are not uncommon in Liberia, West Africa. In January, I was there with a documentary team shooting an episode of ""The World Cup Project"" -- a documentary TV show featuring 11 countries and 11 organizations around the world that are using football for social change and development in the build up to this year's tournament. We found a country still recovering from a civil war that ended a decade ago, and resulted in around 250,000 people dying and thousands more being displaced. During the conflict, children as young as eight were handed machetes and machine guns and told to massacre their families. Child soldiers were the weapon of choice in this brutal war and the scars are still very raw. But there is a glowing red sunset at the end of this story as an heroic organization of local football coaches is changing the face of Liberia. One football game at a time. The woman behind this organization -- LACES, Life and Change Experienced Thru Sport -- is Seren Fryatt, 34, from Muncie, Indiana. After she spent several months volunteering on board a floating hospital ship in Liberia, and playing for Liberia's Professional Women's Soccer Division, LACES was born. Fryatt dreamed of promoting social change and development through her favorite sport -- football -- and her dream became a reality in 2007 when LACES set up its first program in Liberia. LACES' mission is simple: ""To develop positive role models in communities in a manner that is fun and challenging."" LACES currently has three programs in Liberia in Kona, Cotton Tree and Duport Road and has worked with 80 coaches and 700 kids. It is a faith-based organization and recruits its coaches from local churches, they then attend a workshop on coaching and mentor training and are given equipment to register children ages 10-14. According to Fryatt, ""this age group was chosen because it is within this range that children are in the formative stages of learning and comprehension of personal decision making. As well as mentoring the children and training the coaches, LACES also has a feeding program. Weekly, after each game, the kids are provided with a free meal to enjoy with their coach. Sometimes this is the only meal the children get on this day. Before the end of the year LACES plans to roll out a new ""Kick Out Corruption"" campaign to tackle the problem of corruption in Liberia. ""It's vital the children of the future know their rights, and know what is right and wrong when it comes to corruption,"" Fryatt claims. ""Unfortunately corruption is a very real everyday problem here and we want to try and address that."" Many of the Laces coaches themselves grew up during the civil war. They are now teaching children social skills through football, ensuring the children of this generation do not become new victims of the conflict they lived through. And through their work the coaches are coming to terms with their own pasts, their own losses and sometimes their own brutal actions. Horrific memories . LACES' national director, James Moore, was brutally attacked and stabbed in his own home in Monrovia recently as his children slept in the next room. He reveals: ""It brought back horrific memories of the war. The war may be over but the scars still remain."" Some of his memories are truly terrifying. James says that at just 13 years old he walked for four days with his 80-year-old grandmother, through the jungle, to a neighboring village for safety. He went to fetch food for his family and heard a ruckus. As any curious teenager would, James went towards the noise. But he wishes to this day that he had not. He watched as a man executed another man, ripped his heart out of his chest and ate it. ""It is the worst thing I have ever seen and causes me nightmares to this day,"" James admits. Pastor Louis Roberts, Mentoring Manager of LACES, has his own harrowing tales to tell. He lost his entire family under Charles Taylor's regime. His mother, his father, his brothers and sisters all died, leaving him to fend for himself. But instead of picking up a gun, Pastor Roberts found the church and LACES and is determined to educate the children so Liberia never sees another Civil War. ""The children are the future of this country,"" he says. ""It is my job to make sure they learn basic social skills like respect for their families, their team mates and their coaches. These skills are what LACES is all about. We teach the kids how to have fun, but also how to be better people. On and off the pitch."" The ""The World Cup Project"" TV series will debut in June through Snag Films. Follow  on Twitter and Facebook. Find out more about LACES at www.lacesport.org.

"(CNN) -- An amusing video is posted showing an adorable 3-year-old boy asking his mom for a cupcake with the determination of a first-year law student. The next thing you know, the toddler is being criticized by complete strangers. Even worse, his mother and his father are being labeled bad parents. What kind of world do we live in? Answer: A bizarre one where -- in the era of YouTube, Facebook and Twitter -- everyone thinks your business is their business. This isn't about privacy; when you post content online, you give up the right to privacy. This is about propriety; it's about having manners, knowing your place, and respecting boundaries. Just because someone posts wedding pictures doesn't mean you criticize the bride's dress. Do you see the trouble you've caused, little Mateo? The rambunctious toddler from San Jose, California, wanted a cupcake, but his mother, Linda Beltran, said no. So Mateo took his case to his grandmother and asked her, in Spanish. His mother busted him, and -- in a video that has now been viewed more than 3 million times -- explained to the little guy why he couldn't have a cupcake. Unfazed, Mateo continued to argue with his mother for several minutes, all the while keeping up his plea. ""Listen Linda, listen,"" the boy says, occasionally also referring to his mother as ""honey"" and ""babe."" I thought the video was priceless. My first thought was that this kid is a future politician. A perusal of Facebook and Twitter told me that many people felt the same way. You just don't often see 3-year-olds who can communicate this well. I also thought the video was harmless. But on that point, not everyone agreed. There have been thousands of postings, hundreds of tweets, and more than a dozen articles about the exchange between this boy and his mother. One round of criticism was aimed at the boy's father, Kenneth. While he's not on camera, many onlookers commented that Mateo obviously learned to argue with his mother by watching his father. Linda Beltran has since admitted that, yes, Mateo picked up ""honey"" and ""babe"" from watching dad interact with mom. Completely unacceptable, some people said. The father must be verbally abusive when speaking to his wife, they insisted with no proof to back up the claim. Another round of criticism targeted the mother, Linda, for being both too lenient and too strict. Those who thought she was too lenient thought that she should never have tolerated back-talk from a toddler, and those who considered her too strict were concerned that at one point she threatens to give her son ""pow pow"" (which we understand to mean a spanking). Totally unacceptable, said the critics. Up to this point, I'm not surprised. It's part of a larger trend. The last generation told itself, ""I just want to be the best parent I can be."" Today, the new mantra in child-rearing is cheekier: ""I'm a better parent than you."" Critics also took issue with Mateo himself, calling him defiant and disrespectful. How dare a boy talk to his mother that way? They frowned on how Mateo refers to his mom by her first name -- something the mother says the boy seems to reserve for special occasions like long and drawn-out pleadings where he really wants to make what he considers a very serious point. Leafing through all the criticisms, I got depressed. I couldn't help but think that part of the reaction was a ""Latino thing,"" where this noticeably Latino family (i.e., grandma speaks Spanish) was being criticized consistent with stereotypes. The macho father. The permissive mother. The unruly kid. All making for a dysfunctional family. A stretch? Not really. The onlookers were jumping to conclusions about a family they knew nothing about with nothing to go on except their prejudices. A story that had started out being about cupcakes had taken an ugly turn that wasn't at all appetizing. One person even suggested that, instead of watching a future politician, we were really watching a future ""criminal."" I've written about politics for a quarter-century. You don't have to choose. Trust me, we can have both. Right about now, I needed a pick me up, and I got one thanks to Ellen Degeneres. The talk show host saw the video, fell in love, and invited Mateo and his mother onto her TV show. Degeneres gave Mateo -- who loves superheroes almost as much as cupcakes -- a giant mountain of superhero-themed cupcakes. She gave mom a $10,000 check from Shutterfly, one of the show's sponsors, to help out with household expenses. At this point, people are laughing, and people are crying. And it all drowned out the petty naysayers and meddling onlookers who really should watch their manners and mind their own business. This story reminds us what the world needs. More empathy. More respect. More compassion. And more Ellens. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","A video of a 3-year-old boy asking his mom for a cupcake went viral .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A shadowy extremist group calling itself Soldiers of Egypt, or Agnad Masr, claimed responsibility Thursday for three blasts outside Cairo University that killed an Egyptian police brigadier general and injured five others. The group's statement, posted on its Facebook page, said the bombs Tuesday targeted security officials who were stationed outside the university, including Brig. Gen. Tariq al-Mirgawi, police chief of the criminal unit in West Giza. The first two blasts came in quick succession near the faculty of engineering, with the third a little later near the main gate. In its statement, the group said it had delayed the third blast to avoid injuring civilians with shrapnel. Agnad Masr, which announced itself in January of this year and is not well known, said the attacks were a response to police crackdowns and arrests of ''our free women and men.'' Attacks targeting security forces have become increasingly common in Egypt since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsy, who hails from the Muslim Brotherhood, in July after mass protests against his rule.","An extremist group calling itself Soldiers of Egypt, or Agnad Masr, claims Cairo blasts .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The former city administrator of Bell, California -- who's at the center of corruption allegations that he and seven other city officials misappropriated $5.5 million in salaries and personal loans -- is suing the city for breach of contract and labor code violations. In the lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Robert Adrian Rizzo said his employment agreement as city administrator provided for continuous renewals under an ""evergreen contract."" The employment agreement said Rizzo could be involuntarily terminated only for a felony conviction or a crime involving moral turpitude, a legal term describing conduct contrary to moral standards. The agreement also required a 90-day notice of termination, the lawsuit said. Rizzo said he hasn't been convicted of a felony or a crime of moral turpitude. ""As such, the city did not have, and does not have, 'cause' to terminate Rizzo under the agreement,"" the lawsuit said. The 90-day notice was also never made, the suit alleged. Bell officials haven't received a copy of the lawsuit and declined to comment, a spokeswoman said Tuesday. Rizzo, who was city administrator from 1993 to July 2010, is representing himself in the lawsuit and isn't using an attorney, according to the court documents. Los Angeles County prosecutors are accusing Rizzo of 55 counts of corruption charges, including that he allegedly gave nearly $1.9 million in unauthorized loans to himself, his assistant, council members and dozens of others, prosecutors said. In July 2010, when the corruption allegations surfaced, the city council locked Rizzo out of his office and stopped paying his salary, the suit said. In his lawsuit, Rizzo is also alleging labor code violations against the city for not paying his salary and benefits since July 2010, the lawsuit said. His basic salary is $11,000 a month -- plus a $400 monthly car allowance and $7,500 annual deferred compensation paid into a retirement plan, according to court documents. ""Rizzo is entitled to recover back pay, front pay and all wages and benefits owed under the agreement,"" the lawsuit said. ""Rizzo's employment is fully enforceable. The city, however, has failed and refused to pay Rizzo his salary and benefits under the agreement."" Rizzo is among a total of eight former Bell city officials -- called the Bell Eight -- who are facing corruption charges. All eight former officials, including six former council members and Rizzo's assistant Angela Spaccia, have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors accuse the eight of misappropriating more than $5.5 million, including being paid for phantom committee meetings and making illegal personal loans. Prosecutors allege the six former council members, including the former mayor, misappropriated about $1.2 million in public funds and illegally gamed the system to receive exorbitant salaries for doing no work. They face nearly two dozen counts, prosecutors said. The six elected officials facing charges are former Mayor Oscar Hernandez and former city council members Teresa Jacobo, George Mirabal, Luis Artiga, George Cole and Victor Bello, prosecutors said. Between 2006 and 2010, the council members were paid nearly $8,000 a month for meetings on four boards that never took place or lasted just a few minutes, prosecutors allege. CNN's Irving Last contributed to this report.","Former city administrator Robert Rizzo says the city owes his salary .

"(EW.com) -- Divergent was dauntless at the box office this weekend, easily winning the top spot with an estimated $56 million. Meanwhile, the Muppets failed to take multiplexes in Muppets Most Wanted, earning $16.5 million, and the faith-based indie God's Not Dead inspired an awesome $8.6 million from just 780 theaters. Starring Shailene Woodley and Theo James as rebels in a dystopian future, the PG-13 action film Divergent aimed for the same moviegoers who gave The Hunger Games a surprise $152.5 million opening weekend in March, 2012. With a $56 million debut, Divergent didn't reach those heights — and even fell slightly below the predictions of some analysts, who had pegged the movie for a $60 million-plus debut. Like many buzzy films, it started strong out of the gate: A teen-targeted marketing blitz transformed the movie into an event for young fans, who turned out in droves for late-night Thursday screenings that grossed $4.9 million even before the official start of the weekend. Critical reaction has been lackluster, though the film earned a solid A CinemaScore and praise from EW's Owen Gleiberman, who called it an ""agreeably rousing, sensitive-teen-in-Amish-linen-finds-her-inner-tattooed-jock-to-fight-the-power formula dystopian thriller."" Regardless, a sequel, Insurgent, has already been greenlit by Lionsgate for release on March 20, 2015. The trilogy's finale, Allegiant, is scheduled for March 18, 2016, showing Hollywood's continued faith in spring as a box-office launchpad after the success of recent March hits like The Hunger Games ($408 million total) and Oz the Great and Powerful ($234 million). (However, after the first Hunger Games installment's release, Lionsgate did bump the remainder of the trilogy into the more competitive Thanksgiving time frame.) EW: 'Divergent' - Did it get trashed for coming after 'The Hunger Games'? The weekend's other wide release, Muppets Most Wanted, proved that it's still not easy being green — at least at the box office: Budgeted at a reported $50 million, Disney's kid-friendly adventure made $16.5 million in its debut. Despite a pack of big-name, live-action co-stars (Tina Fey, Ricky Gervais, Ty Burrell, et al), Kermit and his gang failed to bring in the same crowds who racked up a $29.2 million opening for the 2011 franchise reboot, The Muppets. (That film stalled at $88.6 million domestically, and its co-writer-star Jason Segel wasn't involved in Most Wanted.) Jim Henson's beloved characters have a long and troubled big-screen history, stretching back to 1979′s The Muppet Movie; 2011′s The Muppets is the highest grosser in the series, while the 1999 flop Muppets From Space marks the group's low point, with a $16.6 million total. EW: 'Divergent' stars Theo James and Shailene Woodley talk pushups and injuries -- LISTEN! Part of the Muppets' problem might've been the holdover success of Mr. Peabody and Sherman (also featuring the voice of Ty Burrell), which offered stiff competition for family audiences and came in third with $11.7 million. Now in its third weekend, the DreamWorks Animation adventure has drawn up $81 million and is a likely candidate for a sequel. In fourth place, the R-rated 300: Rise of an Empire slayed another $8.7 million in ticket receipts, lifting its cumulative gross to $93.8 million. The biggest surprise of the weekend is undoubtedly the success of God's Not Dead, an inspirational drama about a college student who defends his belief in God against a non-believing professor. With no marquee stars (Kevin Sorbo and Dean Cain appear in the film, as does Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson) and little mainstream press, the film earned $8.6 million from just 780 theaters.The Freestyle Releasing title benefited from a highly specific marketing plan that involved drumming up social buzz (the film has over 1 million likes on Facebook) and partnering with the Christian music festival Winter Jam to raise awareness in its target audience. 2014 is shaping up to be a bellwether year for faith-based films: Last month, the religious-themed Son of God opened to an impressive $25.6 million, while Darren Aronofsky's biblical opus Noah hits theaters next weekend amid a swirl of controversy. Here's how the top five played out: . 1. Divergent -- $56 million . 2. Muppets Most Wanted -- $16.5 million . 3. Mr. Peabody and Sherman -- $11.7 million . 4. 300: Rise of an Empire -- $8.7 million . 5. God's Not Dead -- $8.6 million . In limited release, The Grand Budapest Hotel welcomed $7 million worth of new sales thanks to an expansion from 66 to 304 theaters. With a $13.2 million total in its third week of release, the whimsical dramedy is already hot on the heels of director Wes Anderson's biggest hits, Moonrise Kingdom (final gross: $45.5 million) and 2001′s The Royal Tenenbaums ($52.4 million).

"(CNN) -- Michel Mulder may have arrived into the world 10 minutes after twin brother Ronald but he was first when it really mattered in Sochi, as the 27-year-old led home a famous Dutch 1-2-3 in the men's 500m speed skating on day three of the Games. With Ronald taking the bronze, the Mulders became the first twins to medal in the same individual Winter Olympics event since American duo Phil and Steven Mahre in Sarajevo in 1984. There was considerable confusion at the finish as Jan Smeekens, who took silver, raised his hands in triumph at the line -- only to eventually by beaten by just one hundredth of a second. ""I just didn't know,"" Mulder told reporters. ""Then I saw that I had won and I couldn't believe it."" While Mulder screamed in delight, Smeekens struggled to explain the pain of having gold snatched from his grasp. ""It was a kick in the gut,"" said a man who initially believed he had won the competition after the scoreboard briefly showed him on top. ""I was so ecstatic that I won, I can't describe it."" However, the official timings eventually readjusted to show that Smeekens had been beaten by 0.012 seconds. ""I have never seen it in my career and I don't think we will see it again,"" Smeekens surmised. ""I have to congratulate Michel and Roland. It's special. I am proud of them, but the disappointment is overwhelming right now. ""It's silver and I have to be happy with it. Maybe I will be in a couple of hours, days, years -- I don't know. But now it's really disappointing."" Speed skating is decided by the fastest time registered by a competitor in two separate races and Mulder started his second race 0.04 seconds behind Smeekens. The fastest run of the day came from Ronald, whose 34.49 seconds had shot him from sixth place into gold medal position until his younger brother pushed him out in the penultimate heat. Defending champion Mo Tae Bum finished fourth as South Korea, a major force in Olympic speed skating in recent times, was forced off the podium. The Asian nation also failed to medal in the men's 1500m short track even though Victor Ahn, who won three golds for South Korea in the 2006 Games, finished third. The problem for the country of his birth is that Ahn Hyun-Soo, as he was once known, now competes for Russia, a nationality switch he pushed through three years ago. The race was won by Canada's Charles Hamelin, who clinched his third Olympic gold after previous triumphs in the 500m and 5000m relay in 2010. ""It's not my best distance but I had a really good start and was able to control the race afterwards,"" said the 29-year-old. The Netherlands' clean sweet in the speed skating, an event where they have taken all three gold medals on offer so far, had enabled them to go top of the medals table midway through Monday. But they were toppled by the Canadians in the last event of the day as Alex Bilodeau became the first man to win back-to-back Olympic moguls titles. With three gold medals apiece, Canada lead the Netherlands courtesy of having one more silver. Mikael Kingsbury -- who had led going into the third and final event -- took that silver, meaning Canada's men matched their women's achievements on Saturday, when sisters Justine and Chloe Dufour-Lapointe finished first and second. The 26-year-old, who is retiring from the sport to concentrate on other ventures, thanked his compatriots after finishing his career in perfect style. ""There were two other Canadians after me. Every day they push me in training and that's why I got my best skiing tonight,"" he said. ""I'm glad to finish my last Olympics like this. It's going to be a great retirement."" All-Time Battle . Monday could have belonged to Ole Einar Bjoerndalen, the legendary Norwegian who won the 10km biathlon sprint on Saturday to share the all-time record of 12 Winter Olympic medals with compatriot Bjoern Daehlie. Competing in the biathlon pursuit, Bjoerndalen just failed in his quest to become the most successful Winter Olympian of all time -- finishing fourth after his shooting was, quite literally, off target. The 40-year-old finished just 1.7 seconds outside the medals in a contest won by Martin Fourcade as France celebrated its first gold of the Games. Bjoerndalen's speed was good but he missed targets in the second prone and both standing shooting. ""I think I had the chance to win. When I missed the shot, I knew that was the end for me,"" said Bjoerndalen. ""I was not strong enough on the shooting."" ""On the final leg, I tried to speed up but I realized the competition was too strong and I should have done that earlier."" The biathlete has four move events to try to eclipse the retired Daehlie, 46, whose medals all came in cross country skiing. The first gold of the day came in the super-combined gold, as Maria Hoefl-Riesch defended her Olympic title with a total time of 2 minutes 34.62 seconds from her downhill and slalom runs. She finished four-tenths of a second ahead of Austrian Nicole Hosp and American favourite Julia Mancuso, who led after the downhill. ""The hill was steep at the start, which I found especially difficult. It didn't feel great, but I skied fast enough,"" said Hoefl-Riesch, 29. The 29-year-old, who had been fifth in the standings prior to her slalom, sunk to her knees in celebration as Mancuso, the last woman who could catch her, was only fast enough for bronze.","Canada go top of the medals table after Alex Bilodeau defends moguls title .

"(CNN) -- ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""American Hustle"" are on top of the Globes. The two films took home the top prizes at the 2014 Golden Globes Sunday night, winning best motion picture drama (""12 Years"") and best comedy or musical motion picture (""Hustle""). The wins thrust the two films into the top positions for the Academy Awards' best picture honor. The Globes are often seen as an Oscar forecaster. Another film, the space thriller ""Gravity,"" also earned an edge, winning best director for Alfonso Cuaron at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's annual shindig. Short on time? Quick-read list of the winners . ""This is for the hundreds of people who made this film possible, and because of my thick accent, they end up doing what they thought I said, not what I said,"" the Mexican director said to laughs. The Globes tended to spread the wealth this year. ""Hustle,"" based loosely on the Abscam scandal of the late '70s, was the big winner among films, earning two acting honors -- Amy Adams' best actress (comedy or musical) prize and Jennifer Lawrence's best supporting actress trophy -- in addition to the film award. ""12 Years,"" based on a 19th-century slave narrative, won just the drama honor. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" won two acting honors for motion pictures: Jared Leto's supporting actor prize and -- in a shocker -- Matthew McConaughey's nod for best actor in a drama. Cate Blanchett won the Globe for best actress in a drama (motion picture) for her performance in ""Blue Jasmine."" She and Adams are now the front-runners for best actress. Leonardo DiCaprio won best actor in a musical or comedy film for his performance in ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" A number of Twitter users weren't happy with the lack of diversity among the winners. Using the hashtag #notbuyingit, they sounded off: ""Winners: white men. Losers: everybody else,"" wrote In This Together. 5 things we learned from the 2014 Golden Globes . Shockers and surprises . The 71st Annual Globes had its share of shockers, perhaps none bigger than the two awards won by the freshman comedy ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" for best TV series comedy or musical. Star Andy Samberg also won a Globe for his acting in the show. ""Oh no! I didn't prepare anything!"" he said in genuine surprise. He proceeded to thank ""everyone,"" including, with a smirk, ""everyone on my team."" But the Globes are known for their unexpected flourishes. After all, the awards do feature an open bar, and the attitude is often much looser in front of the 100 or so members of the HFPA (and the TV audience) than the august Oscar bigwigs at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Ronan Farrow disses estranged dad Woody Allen's Golden Globes tribute . Indeed, there were plenty of other talked-about moments: . -- Diane Keaton finished her presentation of the Cecil B. DeMille Award to Woody Allen by singing a Girl Scout song in a childlike voice. -- A Teleprompter malfunction led to presenters Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie reading their lines off a piece of paper. -- Jacqueline Bisset, who won best supporting actress in a TV series, miniseries or TV movie for her performance in Starz's ""Dancing on the Edge,"" seemed breathless as she accepted the honor, staring at the camera for long seconds. At one point, she tried to put a hold on her emotions by giving herself a pep talk; at another point, she apparently uttered an obscenity. Backstage, Bisset expanded on her remark that forgiving people is ""the best beauty treatment."" ""I think if you get bitter you're really in trouble and it doesn't progress anything,"" she said. -- Jennifer Lawrence, who won the first award of the evening, was nervous on stage and just as plain-speaking backstage. Asked how she would celebrate, she responded, ""I need to catch up on my drinking."" -- And ""Breaking Bad's"" Bryan Cranston, who played the show's meth-mogul protagonist, celebrated two victories -- his and the show's (for best TV series drama), by telling the press he had an interesting night in store. He would, he joked, do some wife-swapping. Best moments and GIFs from the Golden Globes . Amy 'n' Tina . Hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler started the show by picking up where they left off last year. The pair immediately launched into jokes about the snubbed ""Lee Daniels' The Butler,"" Matt Damon and ""Gravity,"" which was about how ""George Clooney would rather float into space and die than spend another minute with a woman close to his own age."" They were particularly sharp about the often marginalized view of women in Hollywood: Matthew McConaughey losing 45 pounds for ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" or ""what actresses call 'being in a movie' ""; Meryl Streep's nomination meaning there are still great roles for ""Meryl Streeps over 60."" Tina Fey and Amy Poehler through the years . Streep was already in the record books. She was nominated for best actress in a comedy or musical for her performance in ""August: Osage County,"" her 28th nomination. She's won eight times, also a record. Poehler had a better night than Streep. She won her first Globe, for best actress in a comedy or musical TV series, and was hilariously nervous as she accepted. ""I never win these things!"" she exclaimed. Before the show, celebrities made their way down the red carpet at the Beverly Hilton in their finest finery -- dodging some stains left by a sprinkler malfunction. Among the fashion highlights: A revealing Amy Adams (a low-cut gown reminiscent of her outfits in ""American Hustle"") and Lupita Nyong'o of ""12 Years a Slave."" Asked whether she felt pressure about choosing a dress, Nyong'o shook her head. ""I only wear things that speak to me,"" she said. E! apologizes for Michael J.

"(CNN) -- A former Norwegian prime minister has been appointed to lead NATO, the alliance said Friday. Jens Stoltenberg, 55, has been named to the secretary-general post held by Anders Fogh Rasmussen and will begin his new job on October 1.

Stoltenberg served as Norway's prime minister two times, first ascending to the position in 2000 at age 40. His last term ended October 2013. During his tenure as prime minister, Stoltenberg often called for NATO to focus on security challenges close to Allied territory, according to NATO's website.

"(CNN) -- Jay Leno took one for the team, in the form of a $15 million pay cut, to protect the staff of NBC's ""The Tonight Show"" from further cuts. An NBC Universal representative confirmed Friday that the host took a 50% pay reduction. The representative also confirmed that Leno extended his contract until September 2014. A source with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN last month that 20 to 25 employees of ""The Tonight Show"" were let go and that Leno made the salary concession to prevent even more staff reductions. According to the source, the layoffs were part of a plan to adjust the show's expenses to be more in line with typical late-night programming as opposed to prime-time fare. Leno replaced the legendary Johnny Carson as host of ""The Tonight Show"" in 1992, a job he held for 17 years before he left in 2009 to helm ""The Jay Leno Show"" with a 10 p.m. start time. But a few months later, in January 2010, NBC announced that the comedian would return to the 11:35 p.m. time slot. The comic's venture into prime time three years ago was pitched as an attempt by the network to parlay his proven popularity into a commercially successful show. But lagging ratings prompted NBC executives to change course within a few months. That move ultimately led to fellow talk show host Conan O'Brien's departure from the network. O'Brien, who had taken over ""The Tonight Show,"" now hosts the show ""Conan"" on TBS, which, like CNN, is a division of Time Warner. Leno jokes about 'Tonight Show' layoffs .

"(CNN) -- By pronouncement of the sheriff, there will be no Valentine's Day this Friday. That is, if you live in Georgia, north of Interstate 16 and have to drive to get a gift. Oconee County Sheriff Scott Berry has designated northern Georgia a ""NO VALENTINES DAY ZONE"" in a post on the department's Facebook page Wednesday night. Men are ""exempt from having to run out and buy lottery scratchers and Hershey bars from the corner stores until February 18, 2014, due to ice, snow, freezing rain,"" the tongue-in-cheek post said. It's all in fun. But rescheduling the festival of lovers to Tuesday would give the ice storm-battered region time to get roads back to normal and make Valentine's a safer affair. Cutting the monotony . Though it sounds like a pretty practical safety suggestion to motorists, it was more likely something else that drove Sheriff Berry to the decision. ""I think he was just trying to cut the monotony,"" dispatcher John Ogle told CNN. Deputies have been practically snowed in at the office for a marathon 34-hour shift, and the sheriff wanted to give them something to smile at, Ogle said. But not just them. ""I think he was just trying to give our spouses a little laugh,"" he said. Ogle's spouse was unimpressed. ""My wife told me it didn't apply."" School closure announced with 'Ice Ice Baby' No excuses . Women, who saw the Facebook post, lined up to playfully oppose the sheriff's order. 'No excuses!' was their refrain. ""Not my man cause it is my birthday also,"" commented Glenda Robertson, ""so he is not going to get away with this excuse lol."" Men, predictably, backed the lawman. ""T H A N K Y O U !"" said Ken Darsey's comment, leaping off the page. ""Can you make sure my wife gets a copy of this memo?"" wrote Mark Martin. Other women warned: You knew the day was coming, and you knew the weather forecast. You should've planned ahead. Ogle, the sheriff's dispatcher, did. ""Mine's covered. I told her her gift is in the top dresser drawer,"" he said. But for those who didn't manage a gift due to the ice and snow, commenter Bo Edwards has a suggestion for what they can tell their loved ones: . ""It's the thaw(t) that counts....""

"(CNN) -- The federal government must get out of the business of collecting bulk data about Americans' telephone calls, President Barack Obama said Thursday, saying the information should instead be held by phone carriers who would then provide the material to counterterrorism agencies. The shift came after the collection program, administered by the National Security Agency, was revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden. The bulk collection of telephone records was criticized as a major breach of Americans' privacy, and Obama vowed to make changes to the program while maintaining the ability to keep the country safe from terrorist attacks. ""I have decided that the best path forward is that the government should not collect or hold this data in bulk,"" Obama said in a written statement. ""Instead, the data should remain at the telephone companies for the length of time it currently does today."" A months-long review led to the decision, which Obama announced while on an overseas tour of Europe and Saudi Arabia. Congress would have to approve the plan; this week, the House Intelligence Committee introduced similar legislation that would end government collection of phone data. Officials said the White House-proposed changes would require a federal court to grant its approval before the government could obtain phone records from carriers. Those records contain information about calls made to individual phone numbers but do not include the content of the calls. Among the provisions included in the White House's suggested law is an ""emergency"" clause allowing the government to collect phone data without court approval. A senior administration official, speaking anonymously, said high-level government officials would determine what situations amount to national security emergencies, though the official didn't offer a definition of what might constitute such an occasion. Obama, Congress working on changes to NSA . Under the new rules, phone companies would be compelled to provide technical assistance to the government during the collection process. That includes making sure the information is produced quickly and in a usable format. A U.S. official said the White House had ""fairly high-level discussions with some of the providers"" to discuss the changes and how they'd affect individual businesses. Initial industry reaction to the proposed changes was largely lukewarm. A spokesman for Sprint said the company was reviewing the proposal, while AT&T declined to comment. Randal Milch, general counsel and executive vice president at Verizon, said the telecom giant supported the plan to end government collection of data but added that the new rules ""should not require companies to store data for longer than, or in formats that differ from, what they already do for business purposes."" ""If Verizon receives a valid request for business records, we will respond in a timely way, but companies should not be required to create, analyze or retain records for reasons other than business purposes,"" he wrote. Because the current authorization for the government phone data collection program expires this week, officials said the government would seek an additional 90-day approval period while the proposed legislation makes its way through Congress. On Tuesday, Reps. Mike Rogers of Michigan and Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland -- the top Republican and Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee -- unveiled their own plan for ending the automatic NSA collection of phone metadata. The issue touches on deep political and ideological fissures between Republicans and Democrats, promising an extended battle in Congress over the necessary legislation, especially in an election year. On Thursday, Republican Sen. Rand Paul took harsh aim at Obama's record on privacy as the President was meeting with Pope Francis in Rome. ""@BarackObama to @Pontifex: Forgive me father for I have spied. #NSA,"" tweeted Paul, who's been one of the fiercest critics of the NSA spying programs that Snowden helped reveal. Those leaks unleashed a political firestorm, with privacy advocates and others calling the NSA surveillance programs a violation of constitutional rights. In particular, many Americans feared inevitable abuse of a system in which the government collected billions of phone records for possible review in terrorism investigations. Snowden, now living in Russia while seeking asylum from U.S. prosecution, has repeatedly described the surveillance programs illuminated by his leaks as unconstitutional. Several legal challenges have been mounted against the NSA programs, and some of those cases could reach the Supreme Court in coming years to set up a judicial review of the constitutional limits of government surveillance in the post-9/11 era.

"(CNN) -- On the last day of October 2011, the U.N. says the world population will hit seven billion people -- an increase of one billion since 1999. To show some of the impacts of this vast human upheaval, Canadian anthropologist Felix Pharand has created a series of visualizations mapping the presence of technology onto a selection of satellite images showing the Earth from space. U.N.: World can 'thrive' as population reaches 7 billion . Using data from a range of sources, including the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the World Meteorological Organization, the images depict a sprawl of air traffic routes, the underwater cables that carry the internet, road and rail networks, pipelines, shipping lanes and electricity transmission lines. ""These images are illustrations of how far we have come at transforming our home planet,"" said Pharand, who is founder-director of Globaia -- an environmental education organization based in Quebec. ""It shows a human-dominated planet where wilderness areas are shrinking and where the habitats of other species are decreasing in size,"" he added. According to the U.N. Population Fund, it took the whole of human history until the early 19th century to reach a population of one billion people, and it was not until 1927 that the figure doubled to two billion. Now, the U.N. calculates that the global population will reach nine billion by 2050 and, by the end of the century, it says there could be up to 16 billion people on the planet. ""We humans have become a major force of operation on the biosphere. My goal is to foster global awareness of these issues by changing people's worldviews,"" said Pharand. ""The strength of these images is, I think, the fact that they are wordless and global, and their overall meaning can be grasped instantly by almost anyone without having to describe them with labels and legend.""

"(CNN) -- San Diego is a veritable repository of the unique, the one-off and the rare. This southern California city is home to the world's largest lemon (the 10-foot-long fiberglass behemoth sits in Lemon Grove, a small town in metro San Diego) and also boasts the world's largest collection of memorabilia from the late Dr. Seuss, who was a longtime resident of the city's La Jolla community. And two products that couldn't be more different, the ubiquitous WD-40 lubricant and Dr. Bronner's soaps, both have roots here. Check out five more quirky things unique to San Diego: . A civic organist who gives free weekly outdoor concerts . A public uproar broke out in 2011 when local leaders threatened to cut the city's staff organist, a position that's been on the payroll for nearly a century. Every Sunday afternoon since the organ was donated by sugar heirs John and Adolph Spreckels in 1914, a staff organist has stepped up to the keys of a 50-ton pipe organ at a pavilion in Balboa Park. Fortunately for organ fans, tradition prevailed and the organist's contract was renewed for another 10 years. Fans of current organist Carol Williams, a Brit who once played for Princess Diana, line up to buy CDs after the 2 p.m. performances. ""I'm doing everything I can to dispel the organ's dowdy image,"" she says. For years, the Spreckels Organ Society boasted that its namesake instrument was the largest outdoor organ in the world. But then the benefactor of an organ in Austria e-mailed to inform them that their claim had been topped. In honor of the Spreckels organ's upcoming 100-year-anniversary, supporters have started a capital campaign to add another 500 pipes. Take that, Austrian pipe organ. A presidential museum, housed in a high school . Clairemont High social studies teacher Jim Fletcher began collecting presidential memorabilia in 1996 to spice up his American history lessons. With the help of his students, Fletcher started the Museum of the American Presidency that now has more than 40,000 items representing all 44 presidents. Among the 2,000 items on display in the school's library annex are Bill Clinton's golf shoes, a Richard Nixon shower head, a life-size cardboard cutout of Barack Obama and a 1980s ""First Family Paper Doll book"" of Ronnie, Nancy, Ron Jr. and Patti Reagan complete with clothes, accessories and furnishings. There's more to see in a locked conference room that's also open to the public when not being used for, say, a math department staff meeting. Over the years, Fletcher's students have written to collectors, reaping such donations as an original 1844 Nathaniel Currier drawing of all 11 presidents to that point and a portrait of William McKinley drawn in one continuous line. Also gifted to the museum was a miniature JFK 464 campaign license plate sent back to the factory after the president was shot in 1963; the collection also features the LBJ 464 California plate that replaced it. A display case of Woodrow Wilson paraphernalia valued at more than $10,000 features more items than are on view at his birthplace home in Staunton, Virginia. Count the White House movie sets from the film ""The American President"" among the treasures that got away. Castle Rock Entertainment offered to donate the sets, but then reneged when Aaron Sorkin needed them for ""The West Wing."" Fletcher says only about 500 nonstudents see the unique museum each year. Sand dunes with secret messages . It didn't take Edward Snowden to decipher the code in the sand dunes on Coronado Beach. You'd never know the maze-like dunes just north of the Hotel del Coronado spell anything if you're simply playing beach volleyball or building a sand castle, but Navy jets flying overhead can't miss the pickleweed-covered dunes shaped into the letters C-O-R-O-N-A-D-O. City maintenance employee Armando Moreno created the ""sand sculpture"" in 1988 from tons of seaweed washed ashore after a big storm. Using heavy equipment and quick thinking (where else are you going to dispose of five tons of seaweed?) Moreno meticulously spelled out the beach's name and covered the seaweed in sand. A comedian in a chicken suit turned folk hero . Ted Giannoulas, the man behind the famously irreverent San Diego Chicken, was named by The Sporting News as one of the Top 100 Most Powerful People in Sports alongside Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Jesse Owens, Pete Rozelle and Wayne Gretzky. Giannoulas was a lowly student at San Diego State when he was hired by a radio station during spring break 1974 to pass out Easter eggs at the San Diego Zoo. The $2-an-hour chicken-suit gig beat the pay he made as a dishwasher, and Giannoulas, angling to score free admission to baseball games, talked his way into donning the costume again at Padres games. The slapstick antics of the costumed chicken became so popular that Miami Herald sports writer Bob Rubin called him ""the most gifted physical comic since Curly, Larry and Moe."" Giannoulas (as the chicken) has gone on to star in movies (""The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" where he stomped the evil villains in a parking lot), commercials, TV shows and a recorded cover of Rod Stewart's ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?"" A surfboard museum in a taco joint . Taco Surf, a family-run taco shop on Pacific Beach, doubles as a museum of Southern California surf culture. The museum/taco shop/vintage surf film production company was started in 1989 by Sam McLarty and his wife, Cindy. She's the cook and evil genius behind the 15 spicy filling options that impelled USA Today to add this nonchain to its list of the country's top 10 burritos. He's the collector of 90 plus surfboards, all on display at the popular surfer's hangout. ""I've got boards from all the big names in surfing,"" says McLarty who, at 60, still surfs any chance he can. ""I have a 1952 Velzy & Jacobs, a solid 10-foot balsa wood board in beautiful shape. When the sun shines on it, it gives off a warm glow, like a fine guitar. I grew up in Imperial Beach, and my collection represents my lifetime -- from balsa to foam, from long to short, from heavy to light."" More than 50 vintage surf movies play on a continuous loop on two flat-screen TVs. And whenever it rains, Taco Surf offers $1 off their to-die-for chicken tortilla soup.

"(CNN) -- A couple of weeks ago, three guys from a Wisconsin band sat down for an interview. Steven Strupp, Ben Gucciardi and John Anderson are in the band Sat. Nite Duets. It was their first national media interview, and almost immediately, they shared their plans for the weekend. ""We're going to a nude beach,"" Anderson said. ""On a river."" ""Outside of Madison with hopefully a bunch of hippies,"" said Gucciardi. ""We're going to be the creepiest guys there,"" Anderson said. ""I'm bringing my digital camera."" Gucciardi added. Sat. Nite Duets have been described as purveyors of slacker-pop, as hipsters, and as '90s indie rock copy-cats. And it's easy to get the impression that they just don't care. The members all share a humor laced with quirk, and often their songs seem to fall apart at times, right before they come back together. ""I think the sound of [our songs] is kind of misleading,"" Strupp said. ""If it sounds a little sloppy, it means we're not the most proficient musicians."" And often, through their videos and in their album cover art, it seems Sat. Nite Duets is clothing-averse. Male nudity, not exactly a staple of rock and roll, is a constant theme. ""We all have great body images,"" Gucciardi deadpanned. An American band . Something you should know about the Sat. Nite Duets' twentysomething band members: They care about more than just playing music and hanging out in the nude. Right now, Wisconsin is in the middle of a contentious legislative recall election. The recalls stem from a political fight over the state budget, public employee unions and public school teachers' benefits. The band spoke at length about what they saw as the unfair treatment of public- sector employees, and about the self-imposed racial segregation of Milwaukee. ""I feel living in Wisconsin, a lot of the stuff is affecting us in big ways...and makes [our concern] more immediate than before,"" Gucciardi said. But, instead of writing politically charged songs or throwing themselves into election-year fights, the band has focused on poking fun at societal outrages. When there were national calls to ban the alcoholic Four Loko drinks, the band featured the beverages heavily in their video for 'All Nite Long.' Strupp said there are other bands that can tackle politics, and what it means to be an American, much more effectively. And all the members of the band said they don't pretend to have the life experience needed to write socially conscious songs. ""We're not into wearing this kind of seriousness on our sleeves,"" Gucciardi says. ""Like 'we suffered over this.'"" Still, there is a hint of political awareness, even in the band's name: . Sat. Nite Duets is an anagram for United States. Poised for a breakthrough . One of the group's biggest backers is Ryan Matteson. He runs the music site, Muzzle of Bees. Like most of Sat. Nite Duets' fans, he heard their songs after a friend sent him a link to the band's website. ""I listened to it and it was instantly rock and roll, a type of rock and roll I had been missing,"" Matteson said. ""I think this band has so much potential. And I really think once people hear them for the first time ... it's going to be really hard for people to resist those songs."" Each member of the band helps write songs, each member has equal input. Right now the band is content with the success they've achieved. They've been mentioned in GQ. The Onion's AV blog listed ""Throwback Man"" as one of the greatest videos of all time. And each week, the band gets e-mails from new fans around the country who stumbled onto the band. ""I think one of the best kinds of success,"" Strupp said, ""is having people write us an e-mail saying they like what we're doing."" ""Yeah, this one guy told us he had sex with his girlfriend in his grandparents' bed while listening to our album,"" Gucciardi interjected. Strupp paused, and said he didn't know how he felt about that. ""I feel pretty good about it,"" Gucciardi responded.","Sat Nite Duets have been described as purveyors of slacker-pop .

"(CNN) -- FC Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu says the transfer ban imposed by FIFA is ""unjust"" and the club will appeal. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Bartomeu stood firmly behind the Catalan club's coaching system which has nurtured some of the club's biggest stars including Lionel Messi, Andreas Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez. ""The La Masia system is something not to be touched. It won't be changed and we will fight this unjust attack on a model which has been a huge success over the last three decades,"" Bartomeu said. Football's world governing body announced Wednesday that they were sanctioning Barcelona for infringing transfer rules relating to players under the age of 18. Under FIFA laws, clubs are not allowed to sign international players under the age of 18 unless the player is moving within the European Union, is aged between 16 and 18 and moving with their parents or the club and the player both live within 50 kilometers of a shared national border. Following an investigation, FIFA's Disciplinary Committee concluded that Barcelona had broken these rules in the case of 10 young players. As a result, the club has been issued with a transfer ban at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods and handed a fine of CHF 450,000 ($508,000). ""FIFA is punishing a method that it tried, tested and proven over the last 35 years,"" he added. ""FIFA know that we do things correctly -- we had Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Xavi as first, second and third in the Ballon d'Or. We want all of our fans and members to show their indignation at this sanction."" Barcelona had supplied FIFA with information on approximately 50 players under the age of 18 who had registered and played for the club between 2009 and 2013, Bartomeu said. Bartomeu also revealed that he has ""some evidence"" that may point to a conspiracy -- FIFA's investigation was prompted by an ""anonymous complaint"" about an ""unnamed player,"" he said. ""For a while now someone wants to damage Barcelona,"" Bartomeu said. ""We are investigating where the anonymous complaint came from. BarÃ§a have done nothing wrong, we just looked for talent. I cannot say the suspicions point to one club or another."" Bartomeu has not discussed the punishment with FIFA boss Sepp Blatter but Secretary General Jerome Valcke ""considers the measure excessive,"" he said. ""BarÃ§a did not break the rules. When they told (us) the kids could not play, they stopped playing,"" he added. ""We ask FIFA to look from case to case, the circumstances of each kid, so that there can be exceptions to the rules. As a club, we accept FIFA regulations because we are a FIFA member."" The club has 10 days in which to lodge their appeal.

"(CNN) -- If you grew up in the 70s, 80s and 90s, there's a good chance that whole portions of your brain are still clogged up with the jingles, catchphrases and slogans that defined a golden era of television advertising. But in a new age of digital, on-demand and recorded viewing, when the fast-forward button is a weapon of choice, there are signs the 30-second TV advertisement could be on its way out, perhaps sounding the death knell for a marketing tool that became part of the cultural landscape. It already appears to be happening in some countries. In 2009, Britain became the first major economy to spend more on online marketing than on television, with the internet accounting for 23.5% of all ad money, compared to TV's 21.9%. This is bad news for TV ad connoisseurs who, as the 30-second slot evolved from basic product promotion into a sophisticated medium producing cinematic masterpieces and some of the sharpest humor ever broadcast, have come to revere them as works of art. Anyone doubting the power of these should cast their mind back to the adverts of their youth. There are generations of Americans who consider the ""Nestea Plunge"" a normal way to enter a swimming pool and for whom the words ""plop plop, fizz fizz..."" will always mean Alka Seltzer. Likewise few Britons of a certain age can listen to Bach's Air on a G String without thinking of deadpan cigar advertisements. Nor can they forget the bizarre Martian robots that mocked earthlings for peeling potatoes rather than eat instant mash. And then there were the Guinness ads. In a league of their own, these multi-million dollar wide screen epics barely made any reference to the beer they were marketing, instead relying on moodily-lit images of surfers facing tides of white horses, or convicts taming wild mustangs. In a post-economic crisis world, big spending on television ads now seems out of place. Smaller budgets, coupled with new digital viewing habits, have led to numerous predictions about the imminent extinction of the 30-second slot. But in a turnaround that few in the industry predicted, television advertising seems to be enjoying a renaissance, helped by rapid expansion in developing countries and by the platform that was once considered TV marketing's sworn enemy -- the internet. ""A lot of research is showing it is on the way back in, and if you look at some of the most successful campaigns of the past year or so, they're all TV commercials,"" said Chris Arnold, a former creative director at Saatchi & Saatchi who now runs the Creative Orchestra agency. Forecasts back this up. Statistics produced by the Magnaglobal data mapping agency show that while worldwide internet advertising budgets will grow 12.5% annually to $117.5 billion by 2016, TV spending will also rise between 6% and 9% annually to $243.3 billion. ""Great TV commercials are still the epicenter of a lot of stuff,"" said David Droga, head of Manhattan-based ad agency Droga5. ""People started inventing tech to avoid advertising so advertising has to get better which is a good thing. It puts the onus back on advertising to do better by the consumer. Not just bombard them into submission, but actually earn their attention. Inform them, entertain them, and respect them."" Some internet developments are actually helping drive viewers back to old watching habits. The popularity of ""double screening"" -- using Twitter or other networking tools to chronicle what they see on TV -- is believed to be boosting the size of audiences watching in real time. Advertisers can also harness the internet to give TV slots greater impact, allowing them to focus budget on production instead of paying for air time. A recent ad by British dairy firm Yeo Valley featuring rapping farmers ran once in a primetime slot but enjoyed 1.8 million YouTube hits. While the United States, Japan China, Italy and Brazil are currently the world's largest television advertising markets, much of the industry's growth is now focused in developing countries where internet penetration is comparatively low. Emannuel Alozie, associate professor of media communications at Governors State University in Illinois and author of ""Marketing in Developing Countries,"" says television still counts for up to 80% of advertising budgets in nations like Kenya, Nigeria, China, India and Argentina. ""It is still a growth area in these countries, but they are still lacking in terms of expertise and technical abilities,"" he said. ""Television is big and with radio it is the dominant form, and I don't think we're going to see what we see in the West with the internet."" But, says Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP -- the world's largest advertising group -- this could change as cell phones offer cheap ways to access the internet, even in developing countries, and thus a perfect new platform for advertising. ""It is true in the West, internet and mobile new media, social networking is more important from an advertising and marketing services point of view, but the speed of adaptation of the faster-growing markets is going to be greater because mobile has leapfrogged the PC as a cheap form of accessing the internet,"" he said. Such developments aren't worrying the ad men just yet. Says Arnold, even as technology advances, advertisers shouldn't forget that many people still choose to passively consume television in the old fashioned way. ""People are still sitting there comatose in front of the TV and it's a really good place to flog stuff to them.""","UK has seen more advertising money spent on the internet rather than TV .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- A driver of a white Prius with a giant, red plastic flag affixed to its side is rolling through the hilly streets of San Francisco, undelivering mail from mailboxes. The driver is not a thief. He and the car are part of a startup called Outbox that is attempting to pick up where the embattled United States Postal Service leaves off -- by digitizing physical mail. The driver, dubbed an ""unpostman,"" visits Outbox subscribers' homes three times a week, flipping through a thick ring of keys to open the wide variety of entryways and mailboxes. He collects the letters, bills, magazines and advertisements that were deposited there by official postal workers and delivers them to a warehouse. There they are opened and photographed, and the resulting digital files are sent electronically to the recipient through the Outbox website or iPad or iPhone apps. The idea is that for $4.99 a month, someone can make their pesky physical mail disappear (assuming they can resist the urge to peek in their mailbox between pickups). Using a mobile device or computer, Outbox customers can organize mail in files or forward them as e-mails, ask to be unsubscribed from junk mail, have unwanted items destroyed or request that important mail, such as a wedding invite or a postcard, be re-delivered to their home. The company already has more than 600 customers in Austin, Texas, and starting Tuesday it's rolling out in its second city, San Francisco. Creating a shadow, reverse postal service may not be the most efficient way to improve the struggling mail system, but Outbox is unable to intercept clients' mail any sooner in the process. The company has met resistance from the United States Postal Service, which has refused to collaborate with Outbox or let its workers pick up mail directly from local post offices. ""From a startup perspective, we can wait on no one,"" said Outbox co-founder Will Davis. Outbox's legal 'gray zone' Even though Outbox is forging ahead without the blessing of the USPS, Davis said he has a lot of respect for the federal agency and would welcome any attempts to work together. It's a sentiment that does not yet seem to be mutual. ""The Postal Service is focused on providing an essential service in our mission to serve the American public and does not view Outbox as supporting that mission,"" the USPS said in a statement. ""We do have concerns regarding the destruction of mail -- even if authorized by the receiver -- and will continue to monitor market activities to ensure protection of our brand and the value and security of the mail."" Circumventing the Postal Service has been a way to get Outbox up and running. But tampering with mail is a federal offense, and there may be questions about the legality of a third party removing mail from a mailbox, even with permission. Davis argues that once a piece of mail has been delivered, it becomes just another unregulated piece of paper. An Outbox employee taking mail with permission would be no different from having a neighbor pick it up while you're out of town, he said. ""Innovation happens in the gray zone of deregulation,"" said Davis. ""We're operating in that gray zone."" The U.S. Postal Inspection Service declined to comment on whether the practice is breaking any laws. Security and privacy also will be a concern for any company handling mail filled with sensitive financial and personal information. Outbox says its employees undergo more thorough background checks than Postal employees. It uses 512-bit encryption and device recognition to prevent digitized mail from falling into the hands of someone other than the intended recipient. Any unwanted physical mail is shredded and recycled. Can the Postal Service catch up? The Postal Service has been slow to innovate and adapt to new technology on its own, in part because of constraints such as the 2006 legislation that prohibits it from entering into new businesses. The USPS also faces serious financial issues. In 2012, the agency had $15.9 billion in losses and in early February it announced plans to cease Saturday mail delivery this summer in an attempt to save $2 billion. The Postal Service has also been watching technology steadily eat away at its core business for years. The volume of mail handled by the USPS dropped from 202.8 billion pieces a year in 2002 to159.9 billion in 2012. First class and standard mail are decreasing as bill payments, statements and marketers migrate online. One bright spot has been an increase in shipping and packages, the result of the growing popularity of e-commerce. ""They face a lot of challenges that are not of their own making,"" said John Payne, chief executive of Zumbox, a digital mailbox company that deals directly with large companies. He agrees that the Postal Service needs to innovate to stay relevant and thinks they're starting to try harder to partner with innovative companies. Outbox isn't waiting on the Postal Service's call. New, nimble and relatively tiny, the startup can begin experimenting with new ways of handling mail that would take time, and possibly congressional action, for the Postal Service to do. ""We've done what they can't do without trouble, Davis said. ""We're able to play by different rules."" Making money off mail . Just because the USPS isn't making snail mail a profitable business doesn't mean it can't be done. In addition to charging $4.99 a month, Outbox has plans to eventually deliver ads through its apps. They wouldn't be banner ads, but rather would appear just like another item of scanned mail. The company would be in a unique position to know what catalogs, fliers and brands a customer likes or marks as junk, and could charge companies that wanted to reach specific demographics. The companies currently filling up mailboxes with fliers have already been experimenting with online alternatives. If Outbox attracts enough customers and its ads are effective, it could become an alternative to sending ads through the U.S. Mail. ""As time changes the marketers evolve,"" said Jerry Cerasale, a vice president at the Direct Marketing Association. ""The more precise they can be means less waste, less money spent on advertising, and more response."" Outbox's Davis also believes that once his company has saturated an area, it will be in a great position to handle same-day deliveries for e-commerce companies like Amazon. Eventually Outbox will also try tiered pricing for work addresses, and extra features such as forwarding individual pieces of mail to other addresses, he said . For now it's focused on polishing its service and logistics. The company has big-name backers like venture capitalist Peter Thiel and is planning on closing a ""sizable"" second round of funding in April. After San Francisco is fully staffed with unpostmen, Outbox plans to bring its service to New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington. Davis isn't worrying yet about competitors. ""No one is crazy enough to do what we're doing,"" he said.","Outbox picks up mail the post office drops off at homes, scans it and e-mails it to recipient .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama wrapped up a European trip dominated by Russia's annexation of Crimea by shifting the focus of the U.S. and allied response to helping Ukraine rather than confronting Moscow. ""I've been very clear in saying that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,"" Obama said Thursday at his final European news conference of the trip, this time in Rome with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. ""But I think it's also important for us not to promise and then not to be able to deliver."" While Obama pledged tougher sanctions on Russia if President Vladimir Putin continued his expansionist ways, he emphasized steps that don't involve the Russians -- such as Thursday's announcement that the International Monetary Fund would lend Ukraine up to $18 billion. IMF steps in . ""There are ways for us to hopefully influence Russian decision-making and one of the most important things we can do on that front is make sure that the Ukrainian government is stable, that its finances are stable, and their elections go forward as currently scheduled,"" Obama said, adding that ""we are going to have to put a lot of resources and a lot of effort"" to make all that happen. While Renzi and other European leaders have pledged a unified response to any further Russian expansion efforts, questions remain about whether Germany, Britain and other nations with significant economic ties to Russia would join in threatened sanctions targeting major sectors of the Russian economy. The Obama administration has made the threat of such escalating sanctions the centerpiece of its efforts to get Russia to draw down tens of thousands of troops near the Ukraine border and negotiate with Kiev on territorial issues and ensuring the rights of ethnic Russians in Ukraine. Obama acknowledged Thursday that expanding sanctions to target Russia's financial services, energy, mining, defense and engineering industries would impact U.S. and European companies that do business with Russia in the connected global economy. He hinted at the potential difficulty in getting agreement with European allies on tougher measures. Possible expanded sanctions . ""Hopefully we can design sanctions that minimize the impact on American companies or Italian companies and maximize the impact on Russian entities,"" Obama said, later adding: ""Hopefully we don't have to use them."" ""We're continually hopeful Russia walks through the door of diplomacy and works with all of us to try to resolve this issue in a peaceful way,"" he said. Obama was much more expansive on efforts to help Ukraine, calling the IMF loan agreement announced Thursday ""a major step forward"" that required political courage because of required reforms aimed at ending a culture of corruption in the nation's governance and economy. ""It's a concrete signal of how the world is united with Ukraine as it makes tough choices at a difficult time,"" Obama said. He called on Congress to pass an economic assistance package for Ukraine, something the Senate did minutes later to signal a likely compromise with the House on a final version expected to win approval this week. Time to hold Russia accountable for its aggression . Asked by reporters about cuts to military spending by European allies as part of austerity measures, Obama said there was a limit. Military spending cuts . ""We can't have a situation where the United States is consistently spending 3% of GDP on defense, most of that on Europe if we have continuing crises going on in Europe,"" while European nations spend just 1% on defense, he said. Standing next to Obama, Renzi made an impassioned argument that decisions such as military spending and supporting NATO allies involves much more than money. The most important value, he said, was ""the ideal of democracy and freedom."" Asked if Italy would fully contribute to aiding any threatened NATO ally, Renzi said ""the answer is easy, yes."" Before Obama met with Renzi and toured well-known cultural attractions such as the Colosseum, he went to the Vatican for talks with Pope Francis that he said focused on how to help the disadvantaged. ""The theme that stitched our conversation together was a belief that in politics and in life, the quality of empathy -- the ability to stand in someone else's shoes and care for them even if they don't look like you, talk like you or share your philosophy -- that it's critical,"" Obama said in response to a question by CNN's Jim Acosta. Without mentioning the Ukraine crisis, he continued by noting that ""it's the lack of empathy that makes it very easy for us to plunge into wars."" Obama has said Russia has legitimate concerns in Crimea, which has an ethnic Russian majority and is home to a vital Russian naval base. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama, European leaders pledge unity against Russian expansion .

"(CNN) -- After three weeks of punishing losses to its currency the lira, Turkey's central bank has taken what is being viewed as decisive action to reverse negative sentiment. At an emergency meeting Tuesday, the country's main interest rate was raised by 4.25 percent to 12 percent. ""A hike in interest rates was necessary. And it needed to be decisive and credible and it was,"" explains Marios Maratheftis, Global Head of Macro Research for Standard Chartered Bank. ""The decision exceeded market expectations and in my opinion it absolutely had to."" Central bankers in the most vulnerable emerging market economies are being forced into action. The Reserve Bank of India raised the country's key interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 8 percent this week. South Africa's central bank followed suit Wednesday. Their actions come as the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy making group will decide this week whether to trim another $10 billion in bond purchases as it continues to unwind stimulus support. The initial response was positive: investors pushed up equity markets and emerging market currencies Wednesday, starting in southeast Asia. The interest rate hikes by the bigger emerging markets are seen as an effort to plug severe leaks in a monetary dike which threatened to drain reserves that were being used to defend their currencies. Economist Nouriel Roubini, speaking at the CNN emerging market roundtable at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, described what we are witnessing as a perfect mini-storm which is being driven by the Federal Reserve, rising inflation, a slowdown in China's manufacturing sector and large current account deficits in a handful of developing countries. Argentina was the trigger point last week due to high spending and a sudden lifting of currency controls. Now investors have moved on to focus their attention on what Morgan Stanley has called the Fragile Five: Brazil, Indonesia, India, South Africa and Turkey. They share a common economic DNA of large deficits, slowing growth and vulnerable currencies. South Africa's finance minister Pravin Gordhan told me during a recent interview that the investment bank certainly has not done these economies any favors by marking them out last autumn. After a decade of blistering growth, emerging markets have had a severe, albeit delayed, fall from grace after the western-led global financial crisis that started in 2008. Brazil is growing at less than a third of its 2010 rate of 7.5 percent, Russia at less than half and the same for Turkey. As the global sell-off triggered by Argentina unfolded last Friday, Ali Babacan, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister in charge of economic policy said: ""What's happening in Turkey mostly is a repricing process not only just because of the U.S. Fed's tapering but also recent political events have triggered some market volatility."" 2014 will be a challenging year on the political front. There are elections in each of the Fragile Five countries, which will just add to uncertainty. As a result, concerns remain that governments will try to resist taking any action that will curtail growth as voters prepare to go to the polls. Ongoing protests in Ukraine and Thailand have only added to a heightened sense of fragility in the developing world, where the rising middle classes in the developing world do not hesitate to take to the streets in their calls for change or solutions to their problems. A great deal has changed from the past financial crises in Asia and Latin America during the past two decades. With a couple of glaring exceptions, notably Argentina and Venezuela, most emerging market governments are trying to exercise greater discipline on macro economic policy and limiting their exposure to short term, dollar-denominated debt. Let's see if market takes that into account as the U.S. central bank continues to change course.","Central bankers in vulnerable emerging market economies are taking action .

"Toronto (CNN) -- It was confirmation of her worst fears: The lump Audrey Guth found on her breast turned out to be cancer. ""When you get the news that you have cancer, as a mom your life turns upside down,"" Guth said. ""The first thing you think about (is) your children."" Fortunately for Guth, her adult children could support themselves while she underwent treatment. But she quickly learned that not all mothers were as lucky. ""I saw so many moms sitting there with their children on their laps, pulling their clothing,"" Guth said. ""I thought, 'This is not a place for children.' "" With a background running a nanny agency, Guth knew she could help. In 2008, she started the Nanny Angel Network, a nonprofit that provides free in-home childcare for mothers who have cancer. ""Mothers who are diagnosed with cancer are caregivers who suddenly find themselves in need of care,"" said Guth, 59. ""Our program allows mothers the freedom to take a rest, because that's what they need the most to get better."" Since 2008, her organization has helped more than 300 moms in and around Toronto. 'Nanny Angels' to the rescue . Guth's program is staffed by a team of volunteers who have professional backgrounds in childcare. Many of them are cancer survivors. Nearly half of the moms they help are single parents. It's one of the many reasons she believes the organization is so important. ""When you're a single mom, your income is decreased, and you often can't afford childcare,"" Guth said. It's a challenge Shauna Barnett knows all too well. A single mother to a 4-year-old son, Barnett has battled stage 2 breast cancer since September. She underwent a double mastectomy and aggressive chemotherapy to treat her disease. ""If I'm having a bad day, sometimes I can't lift my head off the pillow,"" said Barnett, 38. ""As a mother, I feel so bad to have to say to my son, 'Please go play with your toys so mommy can rest.' He's only 4, he doesn't understand."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes . Once a week, Barnett and her son, Deshaun, get a visit from someone who does understand: Deshaun's ""nanny angel,"" Ruth Van Es. ""We bake cookies and cakes. When it's warm, we walk to the park. (We) play board games, read books,"" said Van Es, a cancer survivor. ""The main thing is to keep their minds off of the cancer and what is happening to mum. I feel like Mary Poppins."" Barnett recently underwent her last round of chemo and says doctors have given her a positive prognosis. She is grateful to Guth's program for making her cancer journey easier. ""The Nanny Angel Network is a Godsend,"" Barnett said. ""When Ruth comes to my home, it's such a huge relief to have a chance to rest."" Cancer changes everything . Last year, Guth expanded her services to help families with end-of-life care. ""When there is a death, we stick around to be there for the kids,"" Guth said. ""This is so essential for the child who just lost their mother and is trying to cope with that."" Ultimately, Guth hopes her efforts give families the peace of mind that their children will be cared for during a difficult time. ""Cancer changes everything for you and for your entire family,"" she said. ""What we do won't take away their illness, but it will certainly make their journey a lot easier."" With her own cancer now in remission, Guth considers herself lucky, and she plans to keep paying her good fortune forward to more moms in need. ""When we get the call that says, 'I finished my chemo' or 'my nanny angel came today, and my child had the best time,' that's when we say, 'Yes, we're really making a difference.'

"Oso, Washington (CNN) -- Among the mounds of mud and ripped-down trees, you see an occasional appliance, a tire here and there, the twisted cables that used to be part of the telephone system. What you don't see are homes. They are gone. And it is difficult to even figure out where they once stood and what became of them. The sheer force of a landslide on March 22 pulverized this neighborhood in rural Washington, leaving behind a graveyard in the debris where 28 bodies have been recovered and where crews painstakingly search for people who are listed as missing. On that awful Saturday, a rain-saturated hillside along the north fork of the Stillaguamish River gave way, sending a square-mile rush of wet earth and rock into the outskirts of the town of Oso in Washington's North Cascade Mountains. Since then, rescuers have trudged through the muck -- 70 feet thick in some places -- looking for bodies, though some cling to hope someone might be found alive even 10 days later. The death toll in the massive landslide rose to 28, the Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office said Tuesday afternoon. The latest victim identified was Adam Farnes, a 23-year-old who died at a hospital on the day of the slide. His name was not on the list of the missing. Authorities so far have released the names of 22 deceased victims, ranging in age from 4 months to 71 years. Twenty people remain missing, down from 22 on Monday, authorities said. 'These are our people': Residents unite to help Washington landslide victims . Tough, nasty, dangerous conditions . About 600 people, including more than 100 volunteers, and cadaver dogs are involved in the search, officials have said. The debris field is full of toxic sludge -- a combination of human waste, toxic chemicals from households, propane tanks, oil and gas that make the search extremely dangerous, according to Lt. Richard Burke of the Bellevue Fire Department, who is the spokesman for efforts on the western side of the mile-wide slide. Every person, animal and thing that comes out of the field has to be decontaminated. Some of the workers have come down with dysentery, while supervisors are concerned that others may be at risk for tetanus. Some of the areas in the search zone are too unstable for crews to work there. It would be like working in quicksand, Burke said. It smells of sewage, but more than a week after the slide, it's not a strong odor, and the dogs, who can detect humans 10 feet under the surface, are undeterred. Two of the nine dogs involved in Monday's search were suffering the effects of hypothermia, the coordinators of the landslide recovery teams said in a statement on the Snohomish County website. Some of the volunteers are aiding in the recovery of family mementos from the debris. The sounds of chainsaws fill the air, as do the rumbling motors of the excavating equipment, which grabs large objects like trees and moves them to the side. Then other people move in for a hand search or a visual inspection of a plot. Orange ribbons mark the grid, indicating areas that have been checked, while some indicate a find of interest. Boards are placed over the thick slop, making a wooden path for workers to walk. One of the biggest challenges has been standing water, but warmer temperatures and a lack of rain have helped workers, who are running pumps all day long to drain areas of the debris field. Areas that were submerged 24 hours prior were able to be searched on Tuesday. Two U.S. flags fly among the men and women working in the field. One, recovered from the debris, hangs in remembrance of lives lost. The other is at half-staff on the lone tree left standing in this part of the slide zone. Who are the victims? CNN's Jason Hanna and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Two U.S. flags fly above the workers in the field, one was found in a debris pile .

"(CNN) -- Eleven years ago, Brenda Heist's marriage fell apart. She was trying to find housing and had been refused financial aid; she was depressed, in despair, crying on a park bench. And then she vanished. What a heartbreaking, terrifying time for her family, who suspected the worst, even declared her legally dead. When she reappeared to great media fanfare last week in Florida, reaction ranged from confusion to scorn. Eleven years ago, my marriage also ended and I moved down the street, leaving the physical custody of my two sons with my husband. The public outrage directed at Heist has been eerily similar to the hostility and anger I encountered when I wrote a memoir about it. In my case, I stayed, co-parenting with my husband, setting rules and attending basketball games and dance shows and parent teacher conferences, and keeping a close, loving relationship with my children. We do homework together; we talk about girls, I teach them to cook (and to clean up!). But I am a part-time parent, a noncustodial mother. For this decision, I have been threatened with death and sexual violence by strangers. I have been called human ""garbage"" and ""worse than Hitler."" And I am still the woman everyone refers to when they are talking about mothers who leave. The hostility and abuse that is directed at the ""mother who leaves"" clearly does not depend on her actual leaving. We want our mothers to be long-suffering, to put their children's needs first and their own well-being last if there is time left. We need her to get dinner on the table and the laundry done and the kids to school and the homework finished and the house clean and the cookies for the bake sale made and the school clothes purchased. Our society is hurting, schools are bankrupt, family finances are squeezed, drugs and guns and sex in the media and international terror are all bombarding our children and the person we designate to help kids negotiate all of this is their mother. It's a big job, too big for one person. Especially when she also has to work, and when she also has a life of her own to care for. But to say that, to act on it, is too much of a threat. I have said it. In my memoir, I took a hard, honest look at my ambivalence about motherhood, at my fears of not being good enough, and the loss of my identity as anything but a mother. My life was changing; my marriage was crumbling; I felt like I was being swallowed up. I loved my children deeply but I could no longer be a full-time mom and I had no other models. How could I remain part of their lives joyfully and not as a stifled, resentful failure? Would we all make it through OK? Our family evolved. It was not quick and easy, in fact, we groped some and stumbled, but I had the support of their father and my boys are now thriving. When we look at it I realize that our family is not abhorrent or unnatural. It looks very much like many other families that have been through divorce, except Mom is the one who lives down the street. Even so, once my book was published, I wrote about the backlash: the neighbors who crossed the street to avoid me, the friends who could not forgive me, the outbursts from strangers who asked, ""How could you leave your children?"" a most nonsensical question in my mind, since I was standing right there. In the hateful response that followed, I noticed something. Many people very proudly proclaimed that they refused to read what I wrote. The headline of one article -- which I did not write -- was enough for them to form an opinion about what a poor excuse for a human I was. They were not interested in learning that there might be any middle ground between ""good mother"" and ""human garbage"" or a positive outcome. They would rather claim that I didn't love my children, that I was a narcissist or that I had simply decided parenting was no longer fun. Their attacks on me were designed to shut me up, but shutting up is the worst thing we can do to motherhood. I know because I have heard from hundreds of women who also left. They write ""with tears in my eyes"" and ""a pain in my heart"" ""thrilled and flabbergasted to find out there is a woman like you, (like me!) out there."" I have heard from women who were escaping bad relationships, women who had to move for work, women who had been swallowed up in caregiving and enabling. I heard from women who were unfulfilled, unhappy and confused, and others who were paralyzed, frozen, and convinced they were failing their children. They were terrified and guilty about their situation and choices. One woman, who spoke for so many, wrote: . ""There is such a horrible stigma to not being a full-time mother, and I tend to shy away from letting the mommies in my online parenting community (which I've been with since they were infants) know that I'm choosing not to have the kids live with me. It's looked at as such a selfish decision, but I chose it because it was truly best for them, even though it does cause me intense pain. ""So again, thank you for speaking up, and giving me reassurance that my kids will not be permanently damaged by not living with me, but that doing the best I can for them and myself will make them more successful in the long run."" Again and again, these women write, ""I love my children with all my heart."" In many cases, they have realized they are not the better parent -- at least not right now. If we listen when they speak, we might notice that most women live in the unacknowledged space between ""stellar mom and wife extraordinaire"" and ""human garbage."" Instead of condemning us and trying to bludgeon us into silence, we need to explore a variety of models for motherhood -- and fatherhood -- that can allow for care and love and support for both the mother and the child.

"(CNN) -- A mother and eight children were killed in a Kentucky house fire early Thursday, authorities said. Two people -- the children's father, Chad J. Watson, 36, and an 11-year-old child -- survived. Both were taken via air ambulance to a hospital in Nashville, Tennessee and were listed in stable condition. The mother was identified as 35-year-old LaRae Watson. The children who died ranged in age from 4 to 15. Investigators have ruled the fire at a rural home in Greenville accidental, according to Kentucky State Police. ""It appears that an electric baseboard heater located in a bedroom ignited some nearby combustibles,"" they said in a statement. The fire was reported at about 2 a.m. Thursday.

"(CNN) -- A mystery surrounding the disappearance of a Washington girl intensified on Thursday as police searched a local park as part of an investigation centered on a man who may be with her and is now wanted for his wife's murder. ""We're not making any assumptions, but I think it'd be prudent for us at this time to make sure we've searched - and this is a very large area - searched this area very well,"" said D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier. ""We cannot ignore the possibility that he may have killed her."" The search of the aquatic gardens area of Kenilworth Park was prompted by evidence the man, identified as Kahlil Malik Tatum, 51, spent time there after the last credible sighting of Relisha Tenau Rudd, 8, on March 1. ""On March 2, we know that Mr. Tatum purchased, among other items, a carton of black, 42 gallon, self-tie contractor trash bags within the District of Columbia,"" Lanier said at a news conference near the search area. ""Not long after that purchase, Mr. Tatum was in the area of the aquatic gardens for a period of time."" Lanier said after the last sighting of Rudd, Tatum continued to go to work and was seen around D.C. several times between March 2 and March 20. Lanier said Rudd was not with Tatum in any of those sightings. Tatum, who was reportedly a janitor at the shelter where Rudd and her family had been staying, appears to have had permission to be with Rudd. The FBI says law enforcement believes Rudd could be with Tatum. The FBI has released surveillance footage of the two together from February 26. The video purportedly shows them walking down a hallway of the Holiday Inn Express located in Washington. The FBI has also released multiple photos of Tatum and Rudd. Rudd's disappearance took on new urgency when police discovered the body of Tatum's wife, Andrea Denise Tatum, 51, at a suburban Maryland motel last week. He has not been seen since March 20. Police in Prince George's County have since issued a warrant for Tatum's arrest in his wife's slaying and Washington authorities issued an Amber Alert for Rudd. Rudd is described as an African-American female, 4 feet tall, weighing approximately 70 to 80 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. An FBI reward in the case was increased from $25,000 to $70,000. According to the FBI, Tatum is 5-foort-7 and weighs around 170 pounds. He's an African American with a ""distinctive tattoo on his left upper arm."" ""While this current operation in the aquatic gardens would be best described as a recovery operation, we have not given up on hope, given up hope that we will still find Relisha alive,"" Lanier said.","Police search park where man at center of probe was seen .

"(CNN) -- Arizona lawman Joe Arpaio has required prison inmates to wear pink underwear and saved taxpayers money by removing salt and pepper from prisons. He has, at times, forbidden convicted murderer Jodi Arias from speaking to the press. The stern Maricopa County Sheriff has said the federal government will not stop him from running his office as he sees fit. But on Friday it did. A judge ruled Friday that Arpaio's routine handling of people of Latino descent is not tough enforcement of immigration laws but instead amounts to racial and ethnic profiling. Some of those profiled sued Arpaio, and Judge Murray Snow found their complaints to be legitimate. The federal court in Phoenix ordered ""America's Toughest Sheriff"" -- a moniker Arpaio sports on his website -- to stop it immediately and has banned some of his operating procedures. The sheriff's office has a history of targeting vehicles with occupants with darker skin or Latin heritage, scrutinizing them more strictly and detaining them more often, Snow ruled. The sheriff's lawyers dispute the judge's conclusion. Defense attorney Tim Casey said he's ""very disappointed by the outcome of the decision. The MCSO and the sheriff have never used race and will never use race in their decisions."" The sheriff's office in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, is planning to appeal the ruling. ""This is vindication,"" said immigration rights activist Lydia Guzman, happy about the verdict. ""They've been stopping people based on the color of our skin, just because someone suspected we might not be authorized to be in this country."" Package addressed to sheriff could have caused 'major explosion' Being profiled . Plaintiffs in the civil trial gave accounts alleging discriminatory treatment. Officers stopped Manuel Nieto and Velia Meraz after they witnessed Maricopa County Sheriff's Office deputies detaining two Latino men. A deputy then ordered them to leave, but they were pulled over again in front of their family business, according to the ACLU, which represented plaintiffs. Read the ruling . The second stop was at gunpoint, they said. Nieto dialed 911, but deputies grabbed him and threw him against his car, according to the suit. Once they saw that Nieto and Meraz were U.S. citizens, they let them go -- without an apology. Plaintiff Manuel Ortega Melendres was vising Arizona on a valid visa. He does not speak English. In September 2007, he was arrested after the car he was riding in was pulled over by deputies. Melendres said he showed the officers his identification but was nonetheless treated roughly and arrested. He sat in a cell for hours before a federal immigration agent confirmed that his documents were in order. A professor of criminal justice presented a statistical analysis he said corroborated that profiling in the county was systematic. Ralph Taylor of Temple University testified that Hispanics are more likely to be checked for immigration status during saturation patrols than non-Hispanics are. Casey blamed the incidences on bad training by U.S. Immigration and Customs agents. The court's ruling will prevent local law enforcement from playing a potential role in immigration enforcement, he said. No longer allowed . The court's ruling prevents the sheriff's office from carrying out some of Arpaio's policies that it said amounted to a violation of the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure, and the Fourteenth, which guarantees equal protection under the law. The MCSO will no longer be allowed to use race or Latino heritage to make any law enforcement decisions, including stopping vehicles, making detentions or holding suspects longer than necessary to resolve specific allegations. The ruling is another slap from the federal justice system against Arizona's immigration policies. The U.S. Supreme court in June 2012 struck down parts of the state's controversial immigration law, including provisions for law enforcement that were similar to those practiced by Arpaio, and which the court deemed unconstitutional. Law enforcement veteran . Arpaio's office claims to be the third largest sheriff's office in the United States and boasts more than 3,400 employees. Before becoming sheriff, Arpaio was a federal narcotics agent, who eventually headed the Arizona office of the Drug Enforcement Agency, according to his biography on the MCSO website. In April, a postal inspector intercepted an explosive package addressed to him. It was mailed a day after the department received a death threat from a major drug cartel. In a CNN interview before his trial began, Arpaio said his department would continue to pursue illegal immigrants. ""I know I'm doing the right thing. I'm not going to surrender by those little small groups, people that don't like what I'm doing. You think I'm going to surrender? It'll never happen,"" the sheriff said at the time. But on Friday attorney Casey said ""America's Toughest Sheriff"" will comply with the court's ruling -- for now.","NEW: ""This is vindication,"" says immigration rights activist .

"Novara, Italy (CNN) -- Like many girls her age, Italian teenager Carolina Picchio shared her pictures, thoughts and emotions on Facebook. But after a video of the 14-year-old allegedly showed up on Facebook in which she appeared to be drunk and disoriented at a party, social media became a source of torment. In a wired world, children unable to escape cyberbullying . An ex-boyfriend and his friends posted a steady barrage of abusive, offensive messages aimed at Carolina. And what started out online spilled into her daily life at school, and among her friends in the prosperous northern Italian town of Novara. Unbeknown to her family, it all became too much for her to handle. In the early hours of January 5, she jumped out of her bedroom window, landing headfirst on the concrete below. Thousands of messages . Carolina's sister, Talita, and some of the teenager's friends say they reported the abusive messages from her ex-boyfriend to Facebook in the hope they would be removed. But, they say, nothing happened. When bullying goes high-tech . ""He was insulting her, mistreating her,"" Talita said. ""We naturally spoke about it with her but she told us not to worry."" Now the Novara prosecutor, Francesco Saluzzo, is looking into the possibility of filing a criminal complaint against Facebook for failing to remove offensive content that may have led to Carolina's suicide. ""In the case of Carolina, it appears some of her friends, some of her relatives, asked for the removal of some of this strong content, and it wasn't removed -- and this played a role in her decision to commit suicide,"" he said. Besides the abusive messages on Facebook, on the day leading up to her death, Carolina had received 2,600 vulgar messages via the messaging service WhatsApp, the prosecutor's documents show. 'Have you hurt me enough?' Carolina left a final letter addressed to her tormenters, which her mother, Cristina Zocca, shared with CNN. ""Are you happy now?"" the teenager asked. ""Have you hurt me enough? Have you had enough revenge?"" Asked for the company's response, a spokesman for Facebook said, ""We are deeply saddened by the tragic death of Carolina Picchio and our hearts go out to her family and friends. How to protect your child from online bullies . ""Harassment has no place on Facebook and we actively encourage teens and parents to report incidences of bullying using the links located throughout the site. ""We remove content reported to us that violates our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and we escalate reports of harassment and bullying to law enforcement where appropriate."" Italian media reported in May that eight teenage boys ages 15 to 17 were being questioned by authorities on suspicion of incitement to suicide and possession of child pornography. But Carolina's mother believes Facebook and other social networks must do more to confront the reality of online bullying. ""My battle is to make the social networks responsible, so that there are protections for minors,"" she said. ""We can't allow for more Carolinas, or other mothers who must cry and be deprived of the lives of their daughters."" Carolina's uncle has posted a video on YouTube dedicated to the teenager and her death. It has become a rallying point in Italy for the fight against online bullying.

"(CNN) -- The crisis in Crimea, though potentially destabilizing to the global economy, may present a silver lining to the U.S. economy: an opportunity to reinvigorate the American shipbuilding industry and Merchant Marine. Even though Russia supplies 30% of Europe's natural gas, President Vladimir Putin's territorial aggression is causing Europe to look elsewhere for its energy needs. The U.S. should be prudent in exporting this natural resource, which has led to resurgence in domestic manufacturing, but I believe that the liquefied natural gas we do send overseas should be shipped on U.S.-flagged tankers and crewed by U.S. licensed and unlicensed mariners. I am pursuing this policy, as the ranking member of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, because it will boost the domestic maritime industry and strengthen our national defense and economic security. U.S. natural gas, globally, is abundant and cheap, making it an attractive commodity for other nations that are net importers of energy resources. The Department of Energy has approved seven liquefied natural gas export applications, and 24 more are pending. To transport gas via the ocean, the world must rely upon two countries to build these tanker vessels: Japan and South Korea. Despite being the early pioneer in gas tanker technology, America is no longer on this list. For decades, the federal government and Congress have largely ignored the health of its own shipbuilding industry, especially the capacity to build large oceangoing tankers, bulk carriers and container vessels. In 1951, we had 1,200 ships in the U.S. foreign trade. Today, we have 90 ships. Obviously, this is not a good trajectory if we are to maintain our heritage as a great maritime nation. Everyone agrees that the U.S. is the greatest naval power in the world. But our naval superiority may not sustain itself if we fail to make the necessary investments to maintain and enhance our technological edge. We can do that by reinvigorating an innovative shipbuilding industrial base, and by requiring that liquefied natural gas exports be carried on American bottoms, we can provide a new long-term market to sustain this revitalization. Those who oppose such a policy often point to two criticisms. First, recognizing at present that there are no American shipyards building liquefied natural gas tankers, how can we require such exports to be carried on U.S. ships that are not being built? They are not being built because in some markets, especially strategic ones like shipbuilding and defense, the government must require that we maintain these capabilities through policies such as the one I am proposing. Our shipyards assure me that if we were to adopt such a policy, they could retool their production lines and have liquefied natural gas tankers sliding down the ways within five years, not long after the first export terminal is completed. The other criticism is that it will cost more to use American-built liquefied natural gas tankers than those built in foreign yards and that this cost differential will be an impediment to the growth of the export market. This argument is about the bottom line of energy companies and not the bottom line of America's shipbuilding industry. Our nation's economic and national security and the well-being of our middle class would benefit from this new source of high-paying jobs, both in the shipyards and in our Merchant Marine. Opportunities must be seized when they become apparent. We have allowed other nations to wrest away from the U.S. its former dominance in this strategically vital industry. We must seize the exportation of natural gas as an opportunity to reinvigorate the domestic maritime industry and bolster our national defense. We are a maritime nation, and we can build liquefied natural gas tankers in America. But in order to do so, we must act now. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Tiger Woods is anticipating an ""emotional"" weekend as his annual invitational tournament bids a fond farewell to the Sherwood Country Club. After 14 years, the Northwestern Mutual World Challenge, as it has been known since 2013, is leaving Woods' native California and heading to the Isleworth Golf & Country Club near Orlando, Florida. ""Sherwood, the board here, all the volunteers that come out and support us in sunshine or rain, wind, cold or perfect sunny So Cal days,"" the 14-time major winner told the PGA Tour website. ""They come out to support our event and have made this event as special as it has been. Most golf tournaments don't stay at one golf course for that long. I foresee certainly an emotional Sunday for sure."" Woods is a five-time winner of the event, which is held as a benefit for the Tiger Woods Foundation, boasts a prize fund of $3.5 million -- $1 million of which goes to the winner. This year's 18-man field features illustrious names such as former world No. 1 Rory McIlroy and American major winners Jason Dufner, Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson. Woods admits it was not easy to get so many world class golfers in one place at the same time at the end of an arduous year. ""It's harder to get good players to play, quite frankly,"" said the 37-year-old. ""And sponsorship dollars are certainly not exactly easy to come by in these economic times. So it made sense for us to move. ""It was certainly not an easy decision. But there are a lot of players that are based there in Florida. It will be a little easier for the guys to make a trek out instead of coming all the way out here, to stay right there in Florida."" Reflecting on his own season -- which has included five PGA Tour titles -- Woods bemoaned his inability to capture a major championship. ""I certainly wish I could have played a little better in major championships,"" added Woods. ""I was there at the Masters and there at the British certainly with a chance, but just didn't get it done. ""The other two I just didn't play well. But winning The Players Championship and then obviously four other events, I think it's a pretty good year. ""I feel like I've improved this year than I did over the previous year. I'm very pleased at the overall year."" McIlroy heads into the event off the back of his first win of the year at last week's Australian Open. This season has seen the Northern Irishman slip to sixth in the world rankings and struggle to display his best form having switched to Nike clubs at the beginning of 2013. At the end of a season when the two-time major winner has failed to challenge for the sport's most prestigious titles, McIlroy was pleased with his ability to grind out a win despite fierce competition from in-form world No. 2 Adam Scott. ""I felt like I saw enough good golf in there to know that it was very close, and it wasn't going to be long before I did win,"" said the 24-year-old. ""What I was happy with the most was the limited amount of times that I have gotten in contention this year, I have played well. I have played well down the stretch. I've played well under pressure, and that is something that I really have improved on the last few years.""","Tiger Woods anticipates an ""emotional"" weekend at his annual tournament .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A passenger who went through an airport security checkpoint -- before remembering that he had a loaded gun -- is facing charges after going back to report his error, authorities said. Travelers go through security at Ronald  Reagan Washington National Airport. Gregory Scott Hinkle, 53, of Davis, West Virginia, went through a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport about 7:30 a.m. Sunday, an airport spokeswoman said. After the traveler evidently recalled having the gun, he returned to the checkpoint and disclosed the weapon, authorities said. The TSA contacted airport police, who charged the man with possessing or transporting a firearm into an air carrier terminal where prohibited, a misdemeanor, and released him. He is scheduled to appear April 2 in Arlington County, Virginia, General District Court. Hinkle did not immediately return a phone call to his residence. A TSA spokesman said the agency reviewed airport surveillance camera videos of the incident and removed the screener from security duties while an investigation is under way. ""Appropriate actions will be taken once the investigation is complete,"" spokesman Christopher White said. White said that 14 guns were discovered at checkpoints around the country last week. On average, screeners find two guns a day, he said. ""We know this is not a systemic problem in that our testing indicates TSOs [Transportation Security Officers] have a very high success rate at finding firearms. Given the high degree of reliability that our TSOs can find even carefully concealed firearms, we are evaluating every aspect of this incident,"" White said. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Mike M.

"Washington (CNN) -- Sure, President Barack Obama claimed victory when he announced from the Rose Garden that more than 7 million people had signed up for Obamacare. ""No, the Affordable Care Act hasn't completely fixed our long-broken health care system, but this law has made our health care system a lot better -- a lot better,"" he said Tuesday, the day after enrollment closed for the year. ""And that's something to be proud of."" The Democratic National Committee emailed reporters enticing them to click on a video to watch ""coverage about how the Affordable Care Act is succeeding."" No doubt, Obamacare will have an impact on the immediate future of health care. It's fair to say that more people have health insurance, whether that's because of premium subsidies or prohibitions against discrimination against preexisting conditions or the fact that those under 26 can stay on their parents' health insurance or from the expansion of Medicaid. And the Democratic victory lap is welcome for a party suffocating under the weight of Obamacare politics, including fallout from glitches with the federal health care website and canceled insurance plans. Now that it's implemented, public opinion of the law is going to be tied to its success or failure. And the first year enrollment figures are only one small indicator. In other words, the Obama administration's celebration might be legitimate, but it could be premature as the long-term viability of the Affordable Care Act unfolds. Obamacare hits enrollment goal with 7.1 million sign-ups . 'The real test is still to come' There's a lot more to the story that begins with Obama's aim to reduce the ranks of the uninsured. ""The real test is still to come,"" said Drew Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. And like any business, the cost and customer satisfaction are going to make or break the law and will ultimately determine enrollment. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, said that if people can't afford to pay their monthly premiums, even with the help of government subsidies, then the law will collapse. ""Essentially, it's all going to be about the cost of the premiums,"" she said. Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius predicted recently that premiums would rise, but at a lower rate than recent history. Sebelius thanks staff, warns work is far from over . The first clue as to whether that's true will come sometime over the summer, when insurance companies begin submitting their rates for 2015. ""When insurers set their premiums for 2014, many of them built in some padding, assuming they were going to get an older sicker pool of enrollees,"" Levitt said. ""When they set their premiums for 2015, they'll be looking at who actually signed up compared to what they expected."" If premiums go up, it will signal insurance companies feel the customers who've enrolled are sicker -- and thus more expensive -- than expected. But if premiums stay steady or even go down, it will show that the initial pool of customers met their expectations. Altman says there's another cost factor -- the cost of the deductible. If people can afford the cost of the premium but their deductible is so high that they can't afford to pay for their doctors' visits, then people will give up on the law. And customer satisfaction matters, too. If people are frustrated their doctor is no longer available in their coverage plan and they can't get the services they think they need, that could persuade them that it's more worth it to pay the tax penalty for not being insured. Growing pains . Other government programs that are now institutions saw their share of troubles in infancy. A New York Times story from 1996 opened with this: ""Medicaid, the little understood relative of Medicare that provides benefits for needy persons who cannot get Medicare, is having trouble persuading state governments to join up."" The story noted that in Kentucky, 12,000 of the eligible 100,000 signed up. Another article in The Times said only 200,000 of an eligible 2 million people nationwide signed up for Medicaid in its first few months. The Children's Health Insurance Program created in the 1990s also had growing pains. States used less than 20% of federal funds granted to them for the health insurance program for low-income children. And a 1999 Times story quoted a health care expert saying it was unclear whether the number of uninsured has been reduced with CHIP. More than a decade later, more than 7 million children receive health benefits through CHIP and every senior over the age of 65 has access to Medicare and more than 66 million people were enrolled in Medicaid in 2010 -- a number that has increased with the expansion of Medicaid in Obamacare. What's next for Obamacare? But Altman says Obamcare can't really be compared to other programs because the number of people who benefit from other government health programs are more uniform: Medicare benefits seniors, Medicaid the poor, CHIP is for children. The Affordable Care Act is so varied, depending on what state you live in and what sort of coverage rules and cost framework is applied. He notes that more than 500 different insurance zones exist around the country, each one impacting consumers differently, so anger in states where costs are high or the governor chose not to expand Medicaid might be at a different level in a state where costs are low. As with any major piece of legislation, the law could still be changed. But politics will determine how much. If Democrats maintain control of at least one branch of government, then it would likely be tinkered with. If Republicans, however, win back the Senate and the White House in 2016, major changes could come. While Karmack said Republicans are ""going to have a hard time repealing the entire act because pieces of it are extremely popular,"" one way to essentially gut the law is to reduce the amount of subsidies that participants receive for their premiums. If the subsides don't keep pace with the cost of the premiums, then the law will likely be unpopular and the ranks of the uninsured are likely to again rise.","The long-term impact of the Affordable Care Act won't be measured for years .
There are still many variables that will determine the law's success or failure .
One expert says it will all come down to whether lower premiums are delivered .
Deductibles and customer satisfaction will also play into perception of whether it works ."
"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- The hospital applauded when the girl was born. Many pregnant women had been evacuated to give birth after Typhoon Haiyan left Tacloban's medical centers in shambles, but the mother didn't have time. Neighbors brought her to a makeshift hospital Monday. ""The baby came out and cried right away. There wasn't problems. There was no bleeding,"" said. Capt. Antonio Tamayo of the Philippines air force. ""It was a perfect delivery in a very imperfect environment."" It was a small victory in an area dominated by loss. Haiyan so brutally hammered Tacloban that the national Department of Health has sent medical teams to take over hospitals so local staff can rest and the medical centers -- many of them struggling to fulfill basic needs without electricity -- can be operational again, the Philippines Daily Inquirer reported. Singapore, Germany and Norway are also sending teams. ""Our first goal is to make the hospitals function, especially if they are not structurally damaged,"" Health Undersecretary Teodoro Herbosa said during a briefing, according to the newspaper. While the destruction is indiscriminate and damaged airports and blocked roads make the distribution of aid difficult, women and children are especially at risk as looting, the mobbing of relief trucks and prison breaks exacerbate an already dangerous situation, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. More than 2 million people need food aid, the Philippine government said. Nearly 300,000 of them are pregnant women or new mothers. ""Women and children are begging on the streets for donations, exposing themselves to abuse and exploitation,"" the U.N. agency said in a statement. ""With power lines still down, the lack of lighting has made women and children at home and in evacuation centers more vulnerable, especially at night."" The UNHCR is also deploying ""protection experts"" among the emergency teams it's sending to the area, and it will distribute 50,000 solar-powered lanterns in hopes of lessening the the risks of ""gender-based violence"" and increasing security among families who have lost their homes, it said. During the storm, survivor Jenelyn Manocsoc held her 11-month-old boy on her head to keep him out of the water as she clung to roof rafters. ""All I hear is many cries, many people crying. Many people say, 'Help!' "" she said. She doesn't know where her husband and many of her relatives are, she said. ""Now I don't know where we go,"" she said. ""It's very traumatic. It's very hard."" Many parents are trying to get their children out of harm's way, a daunting task considering the level of devastation and the long line of people hoping to be evacuated. Another survivor, Jovelyn Dy, had twin boys just three weeks ago, and she desperately wants to find a safe haven for them. ""We wake up, and there's some people inside our house, looters. They could harm my children and us as well,"" she said.","Baby born in makeshift hospital was ""perfect delivery in a very imperfect environment""

"(CNN) -- He's tweaked defense attorneys that potential jurors should be brought in from homeless shelters to boost diversity, sternly chastised lawyers for talking over one another, and pushed against having jury members continually shuttled in and out ""like a Pop-Tart."" In the weeks and months leading to Casey Anthony's murder trial, Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. has proven colorful, quick and -- above all -- in command. ""I know what is relevant,"" he said earlier this spring, in proceedings leading up to Tuesday's opening arguments. ""I have never been shy in not speaking up."" After swearing in a 12-member jury and five alternates early Friday evening, which followed an 11-day selection process in Pinellas County -- the off-site location mandated by the judge, in hopes of drawing from more people who weren't biased by intense media coverage -- the 61-year-old will return next week to his native Orlando to preside over Anthony's trial. Perry will then, as he has in his past 21 years as a judge, keep attorneys in line, resolve legal issues quickly and help jurors develop a clear understanding of the law and this specific case. That jury will decide whether to convict or acquit Anthony on aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter, misleading law enforcement and capital murder -- a charge that, if there is a conviction, could lead to a death sentence. Yet, while he has been an institution in central Florida legal circles for years, this trial marks Perry's coming-out party for many around the country. Already in the Anthony case, he has dealt with his share of testy, controversial and complicated matters, often while flashing his quick wit and easy grin. ""Judge Perry is a good judge,"" a veteran Florida attorney Brad Conway, who had represented Casey Anthony's parents, told CNN last year. ""He knows the law."" In a sense, he was born into the law. His father, Belvin Perry Sr., and another man -- Richard Jones -- were the first two African-American officers hired, in January 1951, by the Orlando police. At that time, Florida was still segregated. Yet the elder Perry remained on the job, becoming the city's first black plainclothes detective, according to the police department. He was still on patrol when he retired in 1976, dying 19 years later. ""A lot of pressure was on those two men, because if they failed, someone would have said they told them so,"" Belvin Perry Jr. said in a July 2010 ceremony unveiling statues of the elder Perry and Jones, as shown in a video on the Orlando police department's website. ""Without trailblazers, there would be no path for us to travel today."" Belvin Perry Sr. never graduated from high school, according to a feature obituary in the Orlando Sentinel, yet he fathered five children who went onto become a school principal, store owner, surgeon, lawyer and judge. Later, Perry Jr. credited his father with helping shape his patient, engaging style from the bench -- especially the importance of listening to others and carefully processing information first before coming to a decision. ""Always wait until you hear everything before you come up with a conclusion -- particularly before you open your mouth,"" the son told CNN affiliate WESH. Still, the younger Perry was not always destined to be a judge. After earning his bachelor's degree in history from Tuskegee University in 1972, Perry spent another two years at the Alabama school getting his master's in education. It was then that he moved onto Texas Southern University for his third degree -- in law -- at the Thurgood Marshall School of Law. The Orlando native established his bonafides early as a prosecutor in Florida's ninth circuit. In 1989, he moved behind the bench by becoming a circuit judge in Osceola County. By 1992, he'd moved back to Orange County and -- three years later -- was tapped as chief judge. In 2011, judges on the Sunshine state's ninth circuit again unanimously voted Perry to an eighth term in that post. That puts him in charge of 65 judges in Orange and Osceola counties through at least 2013. In his time on the bench, Perry has presided over numerous murder trials and high-profiles cases. In 2002, for instance, he ruled against prosecutors when he refused to compel employees of a drug treatment center to testify about an incident in which then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's daughter, Noelle, was allegedly found to have a small amount of crack cocaine. More recently, he ruled against defense attorneys' in their bid to restrict the media's coverage during the Casey Anthony trial. ""We don't live in Egypt. We don't live in Libya,"" Perry said. ""There's a thing called the First Amendment. Whether we like it or not, it's in the Constitution."" Yet despite his preeminent legal standing in Orlando County -- where, police say, Anthony killed her two-year-old daughter Caylee, put the girl's body in her trunk and disposed of it, then misled investigators -- Perry initially was not supposed to be on the case. He came on in April 2010, after Judge Stan Strickland stepped down after the defense accused him of being a ""self-aggrandizing media hound"" who is biased against Anthony. In recent months, defense attorneys have raised various objections -- which Perry, for the most part has overruled -- calling for a slower pace to the case, asking the judge to exclude certain evidence and challenging the diversity of the jury pool. Yet compared to the atmosphere with Strickland, there have been no personal barbs or accusations that Perry is doing anything but trying to adhere to the law, as he sees it. This is not surprising, according to lawyers quoted in several media reports around Florida and others, who say Perry can be counted on to be timely, deliberative and fair. ""He's going to make a conscious, well-developed legal decision in good faith based on what he's heard, one way or another,"" Jeff Deen, a Florida lawyer, told WESH. Conway recalled, during his first appearance before Perry years ago, being invited into chambers and being given two rules: ""One, the train leaves at 8:30 a.m. Be on it. Two, be prepared."" Conway said that Perry assured him, ""If you follow those two rules, you'll be fine."" Watch Nancy Grace Monday through Sunday starting at 8 p.m. ET on HLN.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo salvaged a point for Real Madrid in a pulsating and controversial Madrid derby Sunday to keep his side top of the three-way title race in La Liga. Real were trailing Atletico 2-1 with eight minutes remaining when he equalized after an assist from Gareth Bale, firing home from the edge of the area. The draw left Real three points clear of Atletico, but defending champions Barcelona closed to within a point with a 4-1 win over Almeria later Sunday. Alexis Sanchez put them ahead after just eight minutes in the Nou Camp before Lionel Messi made it 2-0 with a stunning free kick, his eighth goal in six games. Angel Trujillo pulled one back for the visitors and it took late goals from Carles Puyol and Xavi to seal the victory. Atletico were looking to complete the league double over their capital rivals but were beaten 5-0 on aggregate by Real in the Copa del Rey semifinals last month. When Karim Benzema put the league leaders in front after just three minutes from an Angel di Maria cross it looked as Los Rojiblancos would be left with red faces again, but it proved the opposite. Sergio Ramos appeared fortunate not to concede a penalty when he tripped star Atletico striker Diego Costa but the home side were in front by half time as Koke and Gabi struck with spectacular long range efforts. A further penalty appeal involving Costa in the second half was also turned away and home assistant coach Mono Burgos was sent to the stands for protesting. Real pushed for the equalizer and Thibaut Courtois had to be alert again to push away Bale's flicked header. Ronaldo might have leveled when he headed wide from a good position but he made no mistake when presented with a second opportunity in the 82nd minute. The Portuguese star was playing his first La Liga match after serving a three-game ban for being sent off last month. It was the 28th game unbeaten for Carlo Ancelotti's team since a 2-1 reverse to Barcelona last year and they came into the match on a high after a record 6-1 thrashing of Schalke in the Champions League. But the draw did end a run of eight straight wins in all competitions at the Vicente Calderon stadium for Real. ""I think we can leave here reinforced, we have drawn a game in which we were losing,"" said Ancelotti. ""The reaction of the players was good, in general we can be satisfied because Atletico Madrid are a very good team, especially at home,"" he added. In Serie A, Juventus took a bigger grip on the title with a 2-0 away win at AC Milan, leaving them 11 points clear of Roma, who were held to a goalless draw by Inter Milan Saturday. Fernando Llorente and Carlos Tevez scored either side of halftime for the defending champions in the San Siro. Third-placed Napoli dropped points in a 1-1 away draw at Livorno.","Real Madrid salvage 2-2 draw against Atletico in Madrid derby .

"New York (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday announced the creation of a comprehensive administration initiative devoted to spurring development efforts around the globe. Obama calls it new U.S. Global Development Policy and says it's the ""first of its kind by an American administration."" ""Put simply, the United States is changing the way we do business,"" Obama said at the summit of the U.N. Millennium Development Goals, an ambitious agenda world leaders set 10 years ago to tackle global poverty, which has grown amid the world economic recession. The program has four approaches. One is changing the definition of development. ""For too long, we've measured our efforts by the dollars we spent and the food and medicines that we delivered. But aid alone is not development. Development is helping nations to actually develop, moving from poverty to prosperity. And we need more than just aid to unleash that change. We need to harness all the tools at our disposal, from our diplomacy to our trade to our investment policies,"" he said. Second, the administration is changing how ""the ultimate goal of development"" is viewed. ""Our focus on assistance has saved lives in the short term, but it hasn't always improved those societies over the long term. Consider the millions of people who have relied on food assistance for decades. That's not development, that's dependence, and it's a cycle we need to break. Instead of just managing poverty, we have to offer nations and peoples a path out of poverty."" Obama said that the United States will ""partner with countries that are willing to take the lead"" and that the time when ""development was dictated by foreign capitals has come to an end."" ""The United States of America has been, and will remain, the global leader in providing assistance. We will not abandon those who depend on us for life-saving help, whether it's food or medicine. We will keep our promises and honor our commitments,"" he said. But, he emphasized that creating the conditions where assistance is no longer needed is what is needed now. ""So we will seek partners who want to build their own capacity to provide for their people. We will seek development that is sustainable."" The third pillar is putting an emphasis on ""broad-based economic growth,"" Obama said. ""It's the force that turned South Korea from a recipient of aid to a donor of aid. It's the force that has raised living standards from Brazil to India. And it's the force that has allowed emerging African countries like Ethiopia, Malawi and Mozambique to defy the odds and make real progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, even as some of their neighbors -- like Cote d'Ivoire -- have lagged behind."" Obama said the United States will reach out to countries that are moving to democracy from authoritarianism. ""The people of Liberia, for example. Show that even after years of war, great progress can be achieved. And as others show the courage to put war behind them -- including, we hope, in Sudan -- the United States will stand with those who seek to build and sustain peace."" Obama said the fourth pillar is insisting ""on more responsibility -- from ourselves and from others."" He said the administration will work with Congress ""to better match our investments with the priorities of our partner countries. Guided by the evidence, we will invest in programs that work and end those that don't."" He urged donor nations to honor commitments and developing countries to make the tough choices. ""No one nation can do everything everywhere and still do it well. To meet our goals, we must be more selective and focus our efforts where we have the best partners and where we can have the greatest impact. And just as this work cannot be done by any one government, it can't be the work of governments alone. In fact, foundations, the private sector and NGOs are making historic commitments that have redefined what's possible."" As for the goals to eradicate poverty, Obama said, no one can deny the progress that has been made, citing better education, the drop in diseases such as HIV/AIDS, more access to drinking water and ending poverty for many. At the same time, he says, ""progress towards other goals has not come nearly fast enough."" He cites problems like malnutrition, hunger and women ""who lose their lives every year simply giving birth."" Obama stressed the facts that development isn't charity and that some countries are ""condemned to perpetual poverty."" He said progress is possible and practical. ""I suspect that some in wealthier countries may ask, with our economies struggling, so many people out of work, and so many families barely getting by, why a summit on development? The answer is simple: In our global economy, progress in even the poorest countries can advance the prosperity and security of people far beyond their borders, including my fellow Americans."" The policy was unveiled after a year-long review ordered by Obama in an effort to examine how U.S. aid dollars can be more effectively targeted after the world recession, a senior administration official said. ""The policy is about real attention to focus and selectively,"" the official explained. ""We cannot spread limited resources so thinly across every nation."" Upon taking office, Obama promised to double U.S. foreign aid to $50 million by 2012 and make U.S. programs, accused of being riddled with waste and fraud, more effective. During the foreign aid review, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton argued for more control over development policy and control over the U.S. Agency for International Development, arguing that diplomacy and development go hand-in-hand. In the end, the State Department will maintain oversight of USAID, but as evidence of the new importance of development, the White House is establishing a ""deputies committee"" to coordinate policy across the U.S. government, the official said. While USAID will continue to be the premier agency for delivering development aid, the official said, the new strategy offers a ""whole-of-government approach,"" integrating development aid currently handled by about two dozen federal agencies and departments. Countries selected for U.S. development attention also will get assistance with technical innovation and trade. Selection of countries will be primarily based on evidence of strong governance and economic policy, but other factors to be involved are where donors are currently directing their aid and where the private sector is investing, so as not to duplicate effort. Two countries singled out for possible inclusion are Ghana and Bangladesh. The strategy builds on the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a Bush administration program that encourages political and economic stability by making multimillion-dollar investment in nations that offer plans for reform. The official said that although the new policy focuses on more stable countries, the administration does not want to send a signal that the most vulnerable countries, such as Haiti, will be ignored. ""We are not walking away,"" the official said. ""We will still have a commitment to improving humanitarian conditions and helping countries suffering from natural disasters and conflict."" CNN's Jill Dougherty and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Initiative intended to spur global development efforts .

"(CNN) -- Powerful storms that damaged homes and businesses in Texas and the central United States moved east Friday, threatening a wide swath from the Gulf Coast north to the upper Ohio Valley, the National Weather Service reported. In Memphis, Tennessee, early-morning storms knocked out power to 3,495 Memphis Light, Gas and Water customers, CNN affiliate WMCTV reported. Most customers had power restored in a few hours, the station said. Heavy rain caused flooding that closed parts of the Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail at the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, CNN affiliate WEWS-TV in Cleveland reported. The weather service issued a wind advisory for parts of Indiana and a flood warning for central Indiana, with both expected to end Friday night. The main threat will be thunderstorms with straight-line winds and hail, the weather service said. Heavy rain is possible throughout the area as well as in the Northeast. In Birmingham, Alabama, and Jackson, Mississippi, the chance of thunderstorms is 100% before 1 p.m., with storms tapering off the rest of the day. A drenching thunderstorm also was predicted for Cleveland and Cincinnati. In Atlanta, there's a 60% chance of thundershowers Friday and Friday night. On Friday morning, no twisters had been spotted in the South and Midwest. In Texas and Missouri on Thursday night, people were cleaning up damage caused by the storms and, in some cases, tornadoes. Authorities say a tornado touched down Thursday night in Hopkins County, Texas, causing serious damage to homes and businesses such as the Burger Barn Restaurant and Joe Bob's Gas Station, according to CNN affiliate KTVT-TV. The tornado reportedly touched down near Birthright, just north of Sulphur Springs. The storm also knocked down the local water tower. A tornado was spotted on the ground Thursday night in St. Louis County, Missouri, near Glendale. About an hour earlier, the agency reported a ""damaging"" twister with quarter-size hail about 50 miles west near Washington. And a tornado was earlier reported in the Osage County community of Rich Fountain. Denton County, Texas, sheriff's office spokeswoman Sandi Brackeen said that ""a tornado touched down south of Krum."" Outbuildings and barns, but no known homes or commercial properties, suffered damage, said county emergency services chief Jody Gonzalez. St. Louis residents awoke Thursday to tornado sirens as a cluster of heavy thunderstorms began moving through. The weather service confirmed a tornado touched down about an hour before sunrise in the St. Louis suburb of University City, gouging a half-mile-by-100-yard path. The weather service gave the tornado an initial rating of EF-1, packing top winds of 112 mph. The twister knocked down trees and ripped up a gas main in University City, but there were no injuries, University City Mayor Shelley Welsch reported via Twitter. St. Louis County officials said about 100 homes had been damaged. The national Storm Prediction Center noted reports of large hail falling Thursday in parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Renato Reyes-Gomez sent CNNiReport a picture of golf ball-size hail in Denton, Texas, saying he cannot recall anything ""ever this big.""

"(CNN) -- He is a superstar in Arab cinema and has acted alongside Hollywood names such as Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom in worldwide blockbusters. Now, acclaimed Egyptian movie star Khaled El Nabawy is raring to conquer new heights, starring in gripping drama ""The Citizen,"" his first lead role in a Hollywood film. The movie, released last year, has a story line based on the September 11 attacks in the United States. El Nabawy's character, Ibrahim Jarrah, is a newly arrived immigrant from Lebanon, who finds himself wrongly accused of being involved in the terrorist attacks. ""The guy didn't do anything except he was infatuated by the American dream,"" says El Nabawy of his character in ""The Citizen."" ""This is why he won the green card lottery but [it is] his bad luck that he arrived one day before 9/11 to New York. He loves America and he's educated, he is cultured, he is helpful and it's a great message through 'The Citizen' that gives hope. It talks about the cooperation that can happen instead of creating revenge between each other."" See also: 'Egypt's Brad Pitt' calls for people power in Africa . This is the third time in the Egyptian actor's career that he has landed a role in a major Hollywood production. His two previous outings include a smaller part in Ridley Scott's 2005 epic ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" while in 2010 El Nabawy played an Iraqi scientist in ""Fair Game,"" a thriller based on former CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson's memoir ""Fair Game: My Life As A Spy, My Betrayal By The White House."" ""What's common between the three parts -- 'Kingdom of Heaven,' 'Fair Game' and 'The Citizen' -- is that you try to tell people the truth,"" says El Nabawy. ""Arabs are not terrorists; Arabs are kind people, normal people and you cannot portray Arabs through the 15 people who have done 9/11."" El Nabawy, who was discovered by one of Arab cinema's most celebrated directors, the late Youssef Chahine, says he is determined to accurately portray North Africans and Middle Easterners to the rest of the world. ""Of course it is a responsibility, not only towards Arabs [but] toward the other, toward the Americans, toward the West, because I always believe that we know about the West more than the West knows about us,"" he says. El Nabawy adds: ""I feel that our responsibility is to tell the West the truth about us."" See also: 'Harassment map' empowers Egyptian women . Passionate about his country, El Nabawy was one of the first prominent voices in Egypt to come out in support of the 2011 revolution that resulted in the removal of former president Hosni Mubarak.

"(CNN) -- As a Nigerian, and as somebody who has been blessed with a top-tier education, the idea that teenage girls could be snatched from their school in northeastern Nigeria is particularly chilling. I was born and raised in England but spent some of my childhood in Enugu, in the southeastern part of Nigeria. I studied at Oxford University and Columbia University, and my thirst for knowledge made journalism a natural choice. I wouldn't be working as a CNN reporter today if it wasn't for the fact that my parents fled Nigeria during the Biafra War and my mother, despite losing my father in a car accident, sacrificed everything to send me to good schools in England. Girls in Chibok, Nigeria, now have to decide between staying alive and getting an education. Aside from the nearly 300 school girls who were kidnapped in April, 56 boys at a boarding school were also recently killed. This is particularly heart-wrenching because I've always believed education is freedom, especially for children in northeastern Nigeria whose education will be the only chance they have at eventually escaping poverty like my parents did. However, the unyielding presence of Boko Haram has meant that education has become a choice between life and death. And parents, who are naturally more concerned about their children living to see another day than anything else, have stopped sending their children to school. Kidnappings are not just limited to Boko Haram's antics in the northern part of Nigeria but are widespread throughout the country. Every Christmas, Nigerians who live in the Western world often travel back to Nigeria for the holidays. The sheer presence of so many foreigners often means an sharp uptick in the number of ransom kidnappings. Whenever I return to Nigeria, I follow sharp instructions from my mother not to tell too many people I'm coming back, not to announce my arrival ahead of time, and not too stay in one place for too long. We've become even more cautious after my uncle was kidnapped three years ago. He was living between London and Dublin at the time and returned to Nigeria to visit family. One evening, as he was pulling into my grandmother's compound, kidnappers sneaked in behind him on foot. They knocked on the window to his car, and as soon as he rolled down the windows, they hit him over the head, took over his vehicle and drove him five hours through the night. It was by miracle that the car they used broke down. The kidnappers -- and my uncle -- were were stranded. They panicked and let him go. For a very long time, he was afraid to ever go back to Nigeria. When my uncle shares that story, people aren't necessarily as shocked as you might expect. The first thing people ask him is not, ""Oh my goodness, you were kidnapped?"" but rather ""Who did you tell you were coming back to Nigeria?"" This is a country where no one is immune from the rife practice of hostage taking and if you travel to Nigeria, the onus is on you to stay safe. If the Nigerian President's cousin can be kidnapped and the finance minister's mother can be held hostage, then anyone else can be, too. For that reason, I've always tried to avoid traveling back to Nigeria alone, especially during Christmas. I simply won't do it. And when I am there, the idea of going out after dusk alone is inconceivable. Every time my mother tells me, ""You need to go to Nigeria this year,"" I often look for any excuse to get out of it. It pains me to admit that because I cherish my memories of going to school in Nigeria and the chances of anything happening to me -- though possible -- I hope are unlikely. Although I'm not in Nigeria physically right now, the story about these girls has haunted me from day one. Whenever I read headlines about the missing schoolgirls, there's always this feeling of guilt that hovers over me. It's hugely unfair that I live comfortably in a first world country, in a nation that affords me the freedoms and luxuries that I can't imagine living without and those girls, whose only wish is to get an education, have to live in a constant state of fear.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- It's been more than three weeks since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished. The search for the plane continues, even though authorities have said no one aboard survived. Still, some families are hoping against hope as they continue to wait -- stuck in a sort of purgatory. ""At this point, we feel we are still waiting,"" said Mohammad Sahril Shaari. His cousin, Mohammad Razahan Zamani was on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 with his new wife, Norli Akmar Hamid. They were headed to Beijing for their honeymoon. They, along with 237 other people aboard, never arrived. ""If he is no more, we will accept it,"" Mohammad said, at the same time demanding more evidence of what exactly happened. ""We don't know for sure if (the plane) is in the Indian Ocean. We want to see that plane. Even if he's gone, we want his body -- and this is the wish of all families,"" Mohammad said. 'I just feel so helpless' The trip to Beijing was to be his cousin's first out of the country. He'd saved for a year to make it happen. ""He was so excited to go, he was already on the plane. It was just a matter of reaching his destination. I just feel so helpless,"" Mohammad said. Flight 370 vanished March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Authorities are searching the Indian Ocean for the missing plane but have so far found nothing, leaving families with unanswered questions. Some have criticized the response and accused Malaysian officials of giving them confusing, conflicting information. On Monday, dozens of Chinese relatives visited a Kuala Lumpur temple. They chanted, lit candles and meditated. Of the 239 people aboard the flight, 154 were Chinese. ""Chinese are kindhearted people,"" said Jiang Hui, the families' designated representative. ""But we can clearly distinguish between the good and evil. We will never forgive for covering the truth from us and the criminal who delayed the rescue mission."" Jiang asked Malaysia to apologize for announcing March 24 that the plane had crashed, despite the lack of any ""direct evidence."" But Mohammad said that he thought authorities were doing the best they could. ""I am satisfied with the ongoing investigation. There are 26 countries involved in this, and I am so thankful to all of them, especially the government of Malaysia,"" he said. ""I am confident they will find it, but if they don't, I leave it to Allah, maybe this is his wish,"" Mohammad said. 'This is not the end of things' He described his cousin as a cheerful guy, someone who liked to joke around and was well-liked by his family. He recalled their childhood together, playing, cycling and having fun. ""We feel his absence. It is a great loss to us,"" Mohammad said. ""We look happy on the outside, but only God knows what is inside me."" On March 24, Malaysia Airlines and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that the plane went into the southern Indian Ocean and that there were no survivors. Nothing related to the flight has been found -- no wreckage, no bodies, nothing. That has deepened pain for some. James Wood, the brother of American passenger Philip Wood, spoke to CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" when Malaysian authorities made their announcement that the plane had gone down. He has been unable to say goodbye to his brother without being able to see something that demonstrates without a doubt that Philip died. ""I can't, I can't..."" he said. Yet he also said there is comfort in knowing he is not alone. ""We're all human, and we all hurt. We all struggle through things. So I'm not the first one to go through something like this, and I'm certainly not going to be the last one,"" Wood said. ""I don't like being trite when I say my faith is getting me through this,"" he continued. ""It sounds kind of cliche to say it. It's a hope that we have that this is not the end of all things.""

"Editor's note: Do you have great pictures and stories to tell about your latest or favorite amusement park ride? Please let us know at CNN iReport's latest travel snapshot assignment: Theme Park Thrill Rides! (Travel and Leisure) -- As you speed along the ship's top-deck raft ride, waves break at the ocean's surface 150 feet below. It's an acrophobe's nightmare -- and could be the most thrilling moment of your next cruise vacation. We've come a long way in the century since the Titanic, when that ship's heated swimming pool was a mind-boggling luxury. Now it's AquaDuck, the cruise industry's first water coaster, that's making a splash on board the Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy. It takes pluck to stare down the AquaDuck and the rest of the world's craziest, record-breaking water slides. Some, like Brazil's 135-foot-high Insano, are traditional body slides, while others resemble intricate roller coasters and showcase innovation in water slide technology and design. Read on for more of the loopiest, crowd-pleasing water slides around the globe. RideHouse . Where: Happy Magic Water Cube Waterpark, Beijing . When news broke that the cutting-edge Beijing National Aquatics Center (aka the Water Cube) would be converted into a theme park, expectations were high. And sure enough, China's first themed indoor water attraction debuted in 2011 tricked out with valves, cranks, jellyfish, buckets, water cannons, giant bubbles, climb nets and spray tubes -- and that's the short list of design elements. Crazy Fact: RideHouse is made up of 12 slides (the most of any water-play structure in the world) and boasts its own giant water-filled cube that periodically soaks those waiting for their turn. Toboggan . Where: Città del Mare Hotel Village, Palermo, Italy . Eleven slides form Sicily's most scenic water attraction, which runs down a cliff on the northwest coast of the island. On a sun-drenched summer day, the turquoise slide, which is open to guests of the resort, complements the clear-blue waters of the Gulf of Castellammare -- the end point of Toboggan. Keep your eyes open: The slide passes three decks, and each level delivers spectacular views of the 67-acre property. Crazy Fact: A full top-to-bottom journey down this seaside slide will send you into four separate bodies of water: three pools and the Mediterranean Sea. King Cobra . Where: Six Flags Great Adventure, Jackson, New Jersey . The king cobra is the world's longest venomous snake, so it makes sense that this eponymous ride, which opened in July, promises to be one of the craziest theme-park attractions. Resembling a massive cobra, the ride makes an intimidating first impression with its oversize black, yellow and bold orange scales and allows two tubes to zip up to 32 mph. Crazy Fact: The ride's finale features a sudden 25-foot drop at a 50-degree angle that creates the illusion of riders being swallowed by the king's massive mouth. Travel and Leisure: World's coolest bazaars . Wild Vortex . Where: Wilderness at the Smokies, Tennessee . This water-park resort has indoor rides -- with a giant glass roof -- that keep the thrills coming all year long. But adrenaline junkies will want to head outdoors for the newest challenge: the 66-foot-tall Wild Vortex, which debuted in June. While the ride lasts only seven seconds, don't underestimate the rush you can get from its sharp vertical plunge and a gravity-powered loop-the-loop, which riders experience at a 2.5 g-force. Crazy Fact: Don't like surprises? Well, be warned that the first 39-foot free fall is initiated by the sudden release of a trap door. Behemoth Bowl . Where: Chimelong Water Park, Guangzhou, China . Seated face-to-face on four-person rafts, riders reach speeds of 32 feet per second as they plummet down a 262-foot-long translucent tunnel and into a 60-foot-wide bowl (the world's largest). After multiple spins, riders are dropped through a central chute and into a large splash pool. Crazy Fact: A YouTube search of bowl slides turns up videos of unsuspecting riders getting stuck in the ""drain."" Not on this slide. ProSlide's patented CorkScrew™ exit system is the ride's essential design component and ensures a safe ejection. Phew. Insano . Where: Beach Park, Aquiraz, Brazil . Brazil's 135-foot attraction stands out from the crowd, even if it's not quite the tallest waterslide to make our list (Italy's 197-foot Divertical takes that title). Riders are certainly impressed and wait in line to brave that infamous 14-story drop. And you can expect those lines to get longer: In 2011, Brazil's largest water park hosted 788,000 visitors, which represents a 7% increase from the prior year. Crazy Fact: The singular sharp slope produces a rapid descent; Insano plunges at a speed of 65 mph, taking riders from start to heart-pounding finish in less than five seconds. Divertical . Where: Mirabilandia, Ravenna, Italy . Say hello to the world's tallest water ride: the $26 million Divertical, which officially debuted in June. The coaster features a one-of-a-kind elevator lift system that brings 10-person boats to the top of the 197-foot-tall attraction. As they slide along a roller coaster track, riders face drops, hairpin turns and then an oversize splash pool at the finish line. Crazy Fact: The initial plunge takes you through a 45-degree water flume at more than 65 mph. Travel and Leisure: America's best swimming holes . Wiegand Maelzer Slide Tower . Where: Area 47, Tyrol, Austria . This stainless-steel lakeside attraction showcases flawless craftsmanship -- not to mention a handful of pretty extreme slides. After climbing up the 90-foot tower, riders have their pick among five, including a 328-foot-long chute with an added jump section at the bottom. Crazy Fact: The tower is also fitted with five diving boards (at 6.5, 16, 33, 66 and 91 feet high), though the tallest two are reserved for professional divers. Leap of Faith . Where: Aquaventure Water Park, Atlantis Paradise Island, Bahamas . This 60-foot-tall, nearly perpendicular slide cascades down a life-size replica of a Mayan temple -- the hallmark of the resort's 140-acre waterscape. But for many, the real ""leap of faith"" occurs after the initial drop when you're subsequently propelled through a clear acrylic tunnel in a shark-infested lagoon. Crazy Fact: In 2008, a female reef shark vaulted out of its tank and landed on the slide. While no resort guests were harmed (the water park had yet to open for the morning), the shark could not tolerate the chlorinated water and died shortly afterward. Cliffhanger . Where: Schlitterbahn, Galveston, Texas . The park's crowd-pleasing attraction, which debuted in 2007, was part of a significant expansion -- and Cliffhanger still stands as the tallest and steepest ride among all four Schlitterbahn parks in the U.S. Like Summit Plummet, this single body slide consists of an alarming vertical drop. After being propelled from the top of the tower, riders plunge nearly 81 feet at speeds of up to 35 mph. Crazy Fact: The Cliffhanger is designed as an open chute, so you'll be fully aware and exposed every second of that free-fall drop. Mammoth . Where: Holiday World and Splashin' Safari, Santa Claus, Indiana . The $5.5 million Wildebeest ride, a high-speed hydromagnetic water coaster that uses linear induction motor technology, put this water park on the map in 2011. Holiday World continues to expand with Mammoth, a slide towering seven stories and stretching more than three acres -- making it the world's longest water coaster. (Wildebeest takes second place.) Crazy Fact: Six-person rafts are propelled up and down hills in 12-foot-wide channels. There are five enclosed slide sections, which means you'll be doing that twisting and shouting in the dark. Travel and Leisure: World's coolest pools . AquaDuck . Where: Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy cruise ships . Meet ""the Duck"" -- the cruise industry's first-ever shipboard water coaster. The 765-foot-long, four-deck-high AquaDuck debuted on Disney Dream in 2011 and has since been added to Disney Fantasy. Atop the aft deck, passengers hop on a two-person inflatable raft that is then propelled forward by high-powered water jets. Expect to be dropped, looped around and accelerated. Crazy Fact: After the initial drop, riders are thrust through a clear acrylic ""swing out"" flume that extends 12 feet over the side of the ship -- and 150 feet above the ocean's surface. Mount Gushmore's Summit Plummet . Where: Blizzard Beach at Walt Disney World, Orlando . The first thing you see when you enter Blizzard Beach is 90-foot snowcapped Mount Gushmore, the world's most photographed faux-mountain and home to one of the fastest free-fall speed slides. From the Summit's ski jump tower, riders take a vertical plunge straight down to the base of the mountain. Crazy Fact: Exactly how vertical is that drop? You'll plummet 120 feet (about 12 stories) at a speed of 60 mph. Travel and Leisure: World's craziest waterslides . Planning a getaway?

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- The Illinois Senate on Thursday voted unanimously to remove impeached Gov. Rod Blagojevich from office. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich delivers a closing argument at his impeachment trial Thursday. Blagojevich was arrested on federal corruption charges in December. Federal authorities allege, among other things, that he was trying to sell or trade the Senate seat that became vacant after Barack Obama was elected president. After the governor's arrest, the state House voted overwhelmingly to impeach him. The Senate vote was 59-0. Moments after removing him from office, the Illinois Senate also voted unanimously to prevent Blagojevich from ever holding political office in the state again.  Watch the impeachment vote » . ""I'm obviously sad and disappointed, but not at all surprised, by what the state senate did today,"" Blagojevich said during a free-for-all news conference outside his Chicago home during which he answered reporters' questions, hugged supporters and promised a neighbor's child he'll play basketball with him this summer. ""It's something I knew they would do a long time ago,"" he said. ""The fix was in from the very beginning.""  Watch Blagojevich's reaction to his impeachment » . ""As I've repeatedly stated, the governor must be held accountable for his actions to the legislature, in a court of law and to the people of the state of Illinois. ... Today's conviction speaks loud and clear that there are serious issues preventing him from fulfilling his responsibilities and I support putting new leadership in place."" In a written statement later Thursday, President Obama welcomed the end of the Blagojevich saga, at least as it played out at the statehouse. ""Today ends a painful episode for Illinois,"" he said. ""For months, the state had been crippled by a crisis of leadership. Now that cloud has lifted, I wish Governor Quinn the best and pledge my full cooperation as he undertakes his new responsibilities."" Shortly after the vote, newly minted U.S. Sen. Roland Burris, D-Illinois, who was appointed to the seat by Blagojevich, issued a statement saying he stands behind the state Senate's decision to remove the governor from office. Earlier Thursday, Illinois state senators made final deliberations in Blagojevich's impeachment trial. ""Honest and competent governors don't act like Rod Blagojevich,"" Republican Sen. Kirk Dillard said. ""Rod Blagojevich needs to be removed from office."" Sen. Kwame Raul, a Democrat, said the governor had not presented any evidence in his defense and had not called any witnesses. ""He had the opportunity, and it's a lie for him to say that he did not have an opportunity,"" he said. ""The governor presented absolutely no evidence in this case."" Elected officials in Illinois, who were forced to deal with the ugliness of the Blagojevich affair while many would have preferred to be celebrating the inauguration of Barack Obama, were quick to praise the Senate's action. ""Good riddance,"" U.S. Rep. Phil Hare, a Democrat, said in a written statement. ""The Blagojevich scandal has been a national embarrassment. I hope and pray that today's decision by the Illinois Senate will give our state the fresh start it so desperately needs."" The scene outside of the former-governor's Chicago home turned strange shortly after the vote. Within minutes, a media throng outside watched as the governor's state security detail got into their vehicles and left. A guard took a baby seat out of a van that had been used to carry the governor's family and left it outside of a garage. At the news conference, Blagojevich thanked Illinoisans, who elected him governor twice after terms as a U.S. representative and state lawmaker. ""I'm really here today to say how grateful Patti and I and our daughters ... are for the opportunity to be able to serve the people of Illinois as their governor for the past six years,"" he said. ""How blessed I personally feel to get up every day to fight for the average people."" The ex-governor finished his prepared comments and climbed the stairs to his home, then climbed back down to shake hands with neighbors. He then allowed reporters to crowd around and ask questions during an ad hoc news conference that lasted longer than his original statement. At one point, he walked up to at least two neighbor children, hugging them and asking, ""Do you want to be on TV?"" One of them asked, ""Will you play hoops with me this summer?"" Blagojevich answered, ""Absolutely."" After the conference, he again went into a crowd of onlookers to hug several members as people shouted things such as ""We still support you"" and ""Forgive and forget."" During the trial's closing arguments Blagojevich appeared before the senators, saying he had done ""absolutely nothing wrong.""  Watch Blagojevich make his case » . ""I'm here to appeal to you, to your sense of fairness, your sense of responsibility and to the truth,"" he said in a closing address that lasted less than an hour. It was the first time he had appeared at the impeachment trial, which began Monday. The governor firmly denied wrongdoing Thursday, as he has all week on television talk shows. ""If I felt I did something wrong, I would have resigned in December,"" he said. ""If I felt I violated a law, I would meet my responsibility, I would have resigned in December."" The governor, who did not use notes during his remarks, said the allegations against him were unproven. ""There hasn't been a single piece of information that proves any wrongdoing,"" he said. ""How can you throw a governor out of office with insufficient and incomplete evidence?"" As he did in his television interviews, Blagojevich railed against Senate trial rules that he said unfairly prevented him from presenting witnesses or evidence. After the governor's address, the Senate recessed for an hour before House prosecutor David Ellis gave a rebuttal to the governor's remarks. ""He could have put himself under oath and faced my questions,"" Ellis said. ""More importantly, much more importantly, faced your questions. But he didn't do that, did he?"" ""He talked more about the evidence with Barbara Walters on 'The View' than he did in this chamber today, where he's facing impeachment and removal from office,"" he said. Earlier, in his closing argument, Ellis said the governor had demonstrated an ""abuse of power"" throughout his tenure as Illinois' chief executive. Blagojevich railed against the trial on talk shows this week, calling it unfair and saying it sets a dangerous precedent. He has ignored trial deadlines and presented no evidence in his defense.  Watch as Blagojevich takes his fight to Larry King Live » . He told CNN's Larry King earlier this week that attending the trial ""would dignify an impeachment process that's wrong and contrary to every fundamental civil liberty that we as Americans enjoy.""

"(CNN) -- It was a much-anticipated summit between Rep. Paul Ryan and the Congressional Black Caucus. More than a month after the Wisconsin Republican ignited an angry backlash over comments that many viewed as racially insensitive, the House Budget Committee chairman sat down with members of the group to clear the air. Ryan gets constituent pushback over 'inner city' comments . Ryan's 'inner city' comments spark backlash . But Wednesday's session on Capitol Hill didn't bridge the gulf between Ryan's philosophy of addressing poverty and that of the black caucus - whose members defend many of the current federal anti-poverty programs that Ryan's proposed budget would cut. The black caucus chair, Rep. Marcia Fudge, an Ohio Democrat, stood next to Ryan after the closed-door meeting and thanked him for coming. But then she said bluntly that the meeting ""didn't get a whole lot accomplished."" She said while the black caucus and Ryan both are concerned about poverty, ""we just disagree on how we address the problem."" Controversial remarks . Ryan opened the meeting explaining his comments a few weeks ago on a radio program - which triggered the invitation to sit down with the group -- didn't come out the way he intended, according to a Democrat who attended the session. During a March interview with conservative commentator Bill Bennett, Ryan, who has been working on alternative ways to address poverty, said there is a ""tailspin of culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work."" Many African-American leaders called the comments racially charged and the blowback prompted Ryan to swiftly admit his remarks were ""inarticulate."" Fudge referenced the controversy to reporters. ""There was some concern about comments that have been made about the culture in which we find this poverty, but we have agreed today that it is across the board. There is no particular place or people who experience poverty at a different rate than others,"" she said. Didn't say sorry . Democrats who attended the meeting said Ryan didn't say sorry, and wasn't asked for an apology. He told members that sometimes what he's thinking in his head doesn't come across the way he wants and admitted that in the debate going forward, he needed to do a better job at explaining his position. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wisconsin, characterized Ryan's presentation as trying ""to walk back"" what he said, but she said there are still some black caucus members who believe Ryan was expressing his true feelings. Moore told reporters she thinks the meeting helped open a door to continued dialogue. Ryan explained after the meeting ""the point I've been making all along is that we are marginalizing and isolating the poor in our communities and we need to stop doing that as a country."" Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential candidate and a potential White House hopeful next time around, argued ""the status quo doesn't work"" and said the point of the session with the black caucus was to improve ""the tone of the debate so that more people are invited to this debate."" Challenged on his budget . But Ryan also acknowledged that major differences on ""macroeconomics and budgets"" still existed. Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina and the top ranking African-American in the House, said he believed Ryan was sincere, but pointed to his proposed budget and said flatly ""if he stands by his resolution than he can't be serious about the discussion we had today."" CBC members challenged Ryan about the more than $900 billion in cuts to discretionary programs in his budget, saying they didn't mesh with his stated commitment to helping the poor, pointing specifically to his effort to repeal Obamacare and target social welfare programs in his proposal. According to Moore, Ryan ""punted, saying it was members on the House Appropriations Committee who get to decide which federal programs would actually see cuts."" Ryan's work on poverty issues dates to the 1990s when he was an aide to the late GOP vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp, who headed a policy group called ""Empower America."" Kemp visited poor neighborhoods and pushed proposals to earmark federal and private resources to ""empowerment zones"" to lift people out of poverty. Over the past year, Ryan has traveled to a dozen communities around the United States to learn about efforts to reduce poverty and promote more economic opportunity through mostly charitable organizations. He is expected to unveil his own anti-poverty plans this summer. But it's unclear if he will introduce legislative proposals or just some concepts to continue the debate about the Republican party's alternatives to current federal policy.","Rep.

"(CNN) -- In the 22 years that Jay Leno hosted the ""Tonight Show"" -- give or take the spare months Conan O'Brien took the helm -- O.J. Simpson was the celebrity most often used as the butt of Leno's jokes. The TV veteran took aim at politicians and celebrities with equal zeal, landing family friendly barbs about Lindsay Lohan alongside wisecracks about Al Gore.

"(CNN) -- Being James Bond isn't easy. Daniel Craig has the scars to prove it. Daniel Craig at a Tribeca Film Institute screening of ""Quantum of Solace"" in New York. It cost him eight stitches, a severed fingertip and several bruised ribs, but Craig has once again stepped into the shoes of James Bond for ""Quantum of Solace,"" set to debut in U.S. theatres Friday. According to Craig -- who did his interview with an arm in a sling -- the pain is just part of making a Bond film. ""I've always liked the physicality of the Bond movies,"" Craig said, ""and as a film fan, I've always liked it when you're not being snapped out of the story line because you suddenly see it's a stunt man.""  Watch Craig address the world of 007 » . The 22nd Bond flick picks up where ""Casino Royale"" left off. After being betrayed by the woman he loved, British spy 007 pursues the truth behind the organization that blackmailed her -- all the while fighting the urge to make the mission personal. Director Marc Forster (""Monster's Ball,"" ""Finding Neverland"") said that he wanted this Bond to have a raw emotional side to go with the action-movie propulsion. ""I think that I wanted the film to feel sort of like a bullet. It ... keeps us on the edge of the seat until the last frame. But at the same time, that there is sort of an emotional texture to Bond's character, which was very important to me,"" he told CNN. ""And that we feel that emotional texture, because Bond is a character who doesn't really open up, and doesn't really spill his guts out and tell people how emotionally he feels about things. ""But I think it was still important to feel that, and get a little hint of his pain he is carrying around. Because in the last one he lost the love of his life and he's out there trying to search for an answer."" Moviegoers haven't seen the last of Craig. In addition to the Bond series, he's also taking the lead role in two other major pictures this year. ""Defiance,"" slated for release next month, is a story set during World War II; ""Flashbacks of a Fool"" is a British film about an overindulging American actor. ""It's a story I'd never heard of ... about a group of brothers who survived the war in the forests of Belorussia with 1,500 other Jews,"" Craig said of ""Defiance."" ""[They] created a society in the woods, and survived."" Craig, Britain's highest paid celebrity according to Men's Vogue, may be recognized around the world -- but that doesn't make finding his next role any easier. To Craig, it isn't the payday that's important -- it's the story. ""If there were a dearth of really good scripts out there, and being Bond could get me those really good scripts, it would be easy,"" he said. ""But there aren't. They're few and far between, and I have to go out and look for them."" iReport.com: Will you see Bond's latest? Agent 007, Craig's most widely known role, is one he admits was enjoyable to develop in ""Quantum of Solace,"" with its reported $230 million budget. ""He's had his heart broken, and he's been betrayed,"" Craig says of his character. ""The relationships he's had are not defined, and so he's not defined."" Craig says Bond moves to a place of understanding in this latest film -- a ""sort of peace within himself,"" hence the marquee ""Quantum of Solace."" Olga Kuryenko, who plays the mysterious Camille in the film, told CNN she admires Craig's looks -- and his mettle. ""I actually think he's one of the best Bonds ever,"" she said. ""I really liked 'Casino Royale.' I remember I watched it [and] I had no idea I was going to be in the next one. ... And I loved the film, he was great. ""He's a very good-looking blond, you know. And his eyes [are] just piercing. And he has this toughness, you know. ... His body's very strong and he's just, he looks like he can really break your neck."" Forster said that Craig ""humanized"" the often coldblooded character. ""He really put a three-dimensional feel back into Bond,"" he said. ""And collaborating with him and working on the script and on the character, it dawned on me that he really has a deep understanding of what this character is like and ... he understands its details. ... He lends Bond this sort of realistic nature that we all can relate to the character. And I think that's really important in the times we live in right now."" It may be the 22nd Bond film in the franchise, but Craig doesn't look back. How does he feel he matches up against his predecessors as the man behind the super spy? ""That's for other people to decide,"" he says. ""I don't make those comparisons.""

"(CNN) -- An hour-long documentary that aired Tuesday night on Syrian state TV made the case that the United States long has been a force for turmoil, unfairness and violence, not peace, in the Middle East. The special programming did not focus on the back-and-forth that has precipitated a possible military strike on Syria, instead stepping back decades to offer an anti-American viewpoint that casts the Damascus government as a champion of justice and the Palestinian people. Since the days of President Jimmy Carter, the documentary alleges, staunchly pro-Israeli U.S. leaders have consistently been against Syria because of the latter's opposition to Israel. What's happening now, the special claims, is the culmination of a decades-long U.S. effort to destroy Syria largely for that reason. ""If Syria is the oldest (community) in the world, then it is now in the heart of the world,"" the documentary begins. The well-crafted piece -- which included archival footage, interviews with analysts and commentary -- was broadcast at 11 p.m. (5 p.m. ET), which happened to be the same time that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel made their case for military action against Syria to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sarah Palin's offensive remarks about Syria . Led by President Barack Obama, U.S. officials have accused Syria's government of not only using conventional weapons to kill its own people, but also carrying out chemical weapons attacks. Damascus has denied the latter allegations, though Obama -- who has been supportive of an end game in which President Bashar al-Assad leaves office -- has contended there should be a military response to prevent more such attacks. The Syrian documentary's arguments were presented within the context of history, albeit a version highly favorable to that of Bashar al-Assad and his father, and predecessor, Hafez, as well as their longtime allies. It begins in the late 1970s, with video showing Carter's efforts -- in the documentary's words -- to ""impose peace"" in the Middle East. In this scenario and others to come, Syria was at odds with and isolated by the United States because, the TV special claimed, it chose not to join Egypt in working with Israel. Iran and groups fighting alongside Syrian troops in Lebanon, like Hezbollah, are characterized in the documentary in a positive light for their steadfast opposition to Israel and support of the Palestinian people. The film alleges the United States pushed late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to fight Iran for eight years to drain both countries' resources. Number of Syrian refugees rises about 2 million . The documentary doesn't stop there in casting aspersions on Washington. It accuses the United States of training and funding Islamic extremists, including the group that became al Qaeda, and putting them in Afghanistan to battle troops from what was then the Soviet Union. The special ends with a clip from the late 1980s or early 1990s that shows Syrian President Hafez al-Assad meeting with his U.S. counterpart, George H.W. Bush. It promises more such programming to come, without detailing when it might air. The documentary offered scarce mention of the ongoing civil war that's racked Syria since 2011. The United Nations has said more than 100,000 people -- many of them civilians -- have died since al-Assad's forces began cracking down on protesters, setting off a chain of events that led to a war opposing fighting forces. Another 2 million people have fled the war-torn nation, according to the U.N. refugee agency.

"(CNN) -- The $3 million price tag might be steep, but so is the property -- an entire mountain in the beautiful English Lake District. Blencathra, a bleak curve-backed summit overlooking the northern end of one Britain's most popular national parks, has been put up for sale by its current owner to pay a tax bill. ""We went through the pictures and furniture first,"" Hugh Lowther told the Daily Telegraph newspaper. Lowther is the eighth Earl of Lonsdale, whose family has owned Blencathra for four centuries. Lowther said despite offloading an artwork by Joseph Turner, Britain's most popular landscape painter, looming debts left him looking elsewhere. ""We sold a Turner for Â£1.4 million ($2.37 million), a derelict farm steading and a couple of cottages which were vacant. And now Blencathra."" Reaching 868-meters above sea level, the mountain comprises six separate ""tops"" and is often referred to locally as ""saddleback."" 'Unique investment opportunity' The mountain's rugged moss-covered flanks attract hikers from around the world. Even though realtors call the sale a ""unique investment opportunity,"" the 2,677-acre property is subject to strict rural zoning regulations and would be tricky to build on. ""It's such a visible part of the landscape; that's what makes it special,"" John Robson, managing director of H&H Land and Property, which is handling the sale, told the Financial Times. The purchaser will, however, have the right to call themselves a Lord. The sale will include the ""Lordship of the Manor of Threlkeld,"" an ancient feudal title that has been passed down through the Lowther family since it acquired the land in the 1620s. It's a purely ceremonial title -- no crowns, scepters or castles will change hands. Sealed bids are being invited for the mountain with sale expected to be completed in July. Potential buyers should be warned though -- some analysts say Britain's booming property market, like the climbers on Blencathra, may soon reach its peak.","Entire mountain put up for sale in Britain's popular Lake District tourist destination .

"(CNN) -- As he prepares Sunday's Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, Hamish Hamilton isn't free with details about what its millions of viewers should expect. Except for one. ""I'm fairly sure that the lights will stay on for the entire Super Bowl,"" said Hamilton, the Grammy-nominated director of this year's show, which will feature singer R&B singer Bruno Mars and rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers. ""I would be surprised if that happened again."" Moments after Beyonce finished her performance last year, the New Orleans Superdome went dark for 35 minutes. ""Not guilty,"" says Hamilton, a native of Blackpool, England, who began his career with the BBC. ""The only thing I can say with certainty was that the electricity going out had nothing to do with the halftime show because we were on generator power,"" said Hamilton, who also directed last year's show. ""It was a conscious decision, and it was an excellent decision."" The funniest tweets of the #Blackout ... er ... Super Bowl . More than 110.5 million people worldwide watched the halftime show last year. Only 2012's performance by Madonna drew more viewers, and Beyonce's performance -- and the blackout that followed -- generated 229,000 tweets per minute on Twitter, its second most-tweeted moment ever. The production is something of a technological marvel in and of itself. Last year, 700 people transformed the field at the Superdome into a concert stage incorporating lasers, strobes, pyrotechnics and a preprogrammed stage floor that rose to become a 24-foot by 32-foot video wall. Hamilton is no stranger to such on-the-fly productions. In addition to several Super Bowl halftimes, he's directed the Academy Awards, the MTV Video Music Awards and live concert films for artists such as the Rolling Stones and U2. In 2012, he worked with movie director Danny Boyle, heading up the televised versions of the Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. This year's Bruno Mars production will be no less complex than last year's, said Hamilton. But don't be surprised if the high-tech nature of the show isn't in your face the whole time. ""With the kind of stuff that I do, technology is amazing. But at the end of the day, stories are way more powerful,"" he said. ""So, if you've got somebody on a stage crying because an award means so much to them, or an artist on stage singing an incredibly powerful song to an audience that's with them -- sometimes you just need one shot, one light and an amazing performer."" ""Technology's massively important,"" Hamiltion continued. ""You rely on it."" But even as the technology at his disposal has improved, Hamilton says he's come to look at it differently. ""Back in the day, I let the technology lead me,"" he said. ""Now, I always prefer the story or the music or the show to lead me. Now, in my own head, it's the story first, the concept first, and the technology is second. ""Technology allows you to do things now you could have never done before. So there's definitely a yin and a yang to it."" In some ways, what Hamilton does is simultaneously the same and the exact opposite of what a movie director does. For a movie, a shoot can last for weeks, or months, with weeks more of post-production after that. On the flip side, directing a live event means months of preparation, followed by a shoot that lasts for just a brief time. In the case of the Super Bowl show, that's about 12 minutes. It might seem like that would be a chaotic 12 minutes. But Hamilton said that with enough preparation, the opposite can be the case. ""When I was shooting the (2013) show, I actually said very little,"" he said. ""Because what we were doing was shooting a show that we all knew precisely what we were doing. ""We knew where Beyonce was going to be at all points. We knew when the crowd was going to go crazy. We knew almost exactly the show we were going to get."" But Hamilton, who is also working on a Peter Gabriel concert film he shot at several concerts last year, will have one new X-factor to deal with this Sunday. This year's game will be at MetLife Stadium at the New Jersey Meadowlands -- an outdoor venue. The Northeast U.S. already has been clobbered this winter by storms that have dumped more than a foot of snow in places and brought temperatures in the single digits -- a full 15 to 25 degrees below normal before what was already predicted to be the coldest Super Bowl in the game's history. Last week, 10 inches of snow fell on MetLife Stadium. The early forecast for Sunday in Northern New Jersey is for clear skies and milder temperatures, but you never know. ""The weather's an enormous factor,"" Hamilton said. ""But, in every Super Bowl, it has its unique challenges. And from those unique challenges, you create something great. If every situation were the same, the shows may not be as diverse as they are."" Hamilton hinted heavily that the open stadium will be somehow utilized in Sunday's halftime show. ""I guess what I'm trying to say is, in each set of circumstances ... we find creative solutions,"" he said. ""We're tested and pushed in this direction, as opposed to another, and that's kind of exciting.""","Hamish Hamilton has directed Super Bowl halftime shows, Oscars, Olympic ceremonies .
He says technology is crucial but can distract from performances .

"(CNN) -- It's official: The weather has been a bit weird this winter. The nation's climate agency says so -- and, in part, explains why. There is method to the meteorological madness. And it has served to spread the weirdness around the world, from the American West all the way to Russia, a climate expert from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. The drought parching California; those two snowpocalypses in the South; the unrelenting New England snow; the sopping soaking of the UK; short sleeves on Sochi's snow-hungry slopes. One single weather event has a hand in all of them, said NOAA environmentalist Bill Lapenta. ""They are associated with that long-wave pattern, so they are connected in that sense,"" he said. That ""long-wave pattern"" is like a whip that got swung in California and has cracked in all the other places. A big, sturdy ridge of high pressure air has blustered rain clouds away from California, and at the same time, it has pushed the jet-stream way up into Canada. What goes up... In reaction to that, the jet-stream has swung back deeper into the South than usual, carrying Canadian cold with it. Voila. Snow and ice from Louisiana to the Carolinas. Then it has whipped back up, helping big storms dump snow over the Northeast. From there, the same jet-stream has crossed the Atlantic and brought weather that flooded Great Britain in the wettest January there in two and a half centuries. Down the road a bit, at the Winter Olympics, it's practically springtime in Sochi, and it's that same jet-stream dragging in warmth that's boosting temperatures well above freezing. But it gets even worse. The jet-stream is moving slower than in past years, which means that all that ugly weather is hovering over places for longer periods, plaguing them with more of its nastiness than usual. It has weather-beaten people in many parts of the world groaning the same moan: ""I've never seen weather like this before."" Are they exaggerating? Maybe not. Let's have a look at the season's weather, starting with the whip's handle -- in California -- and follow the jet-stream's lash from there. Cali-dehydration . The dryness in California is making its mark in the history books. The state grows more than the lion's share of the tomatoes used in U.S. processed foods, farmer Mark Borba brags. This year? Zero, he said. For the first time in its history, the California Water Project - a system of canals and reservoirs that provide water to two thirds of the people in the state's Central Valley -- set its allocation for all of them to zero. This pertains to people in the country and in cities alike. Borba blames it in part on bureaucratic tangles between state and local authorities who decide over the water's release. But that doesn't negate the fact that there is a water shortage. His farm gets its water from reservoirs 500 miles to his north. This year, they are running on bare minimum. Further down the jet-stream, there's been precipitation to spare. Winter blunderland . If you haven't been living under a rock, you've heard about or felt the winter ills that have walloped the nation's Southeast. About two weeks ago, less than three inches of snow turned the region's largest city into a gridlocked parking lot, where thousands of motorists sat for as much as 20 hours in their cars, while lows dipped into the teens. Not being able to deal with snow is no surprise for a region that usually gets iced over every ten years or so -- although the last such shellacking came three years ago. Then this week, a second winter storm polished a path of white from Alabama all the way up to Maine. Not that the Northeast is not used to snow, after all it's winter, and it's normal there. But the frequency of heavy snows has had leaders in the region huffing for a break. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio greeted reporters covering the storm with the line: ""Welcome to winter storm six of the last six weeks."" And as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said before the worst of the storm hit: ""This has just been a brutal winter where it never really has gotten warmer. And so the natural melting away of snow and ice is not happening."" Exaggeration or winter storm exhaustion? It may have been a long-planned vacation, but after the last storm passed, Christie took off with his family for the warmer latitudes of Puerto Rico. A previous recent snow-thumping wrecked much of his inauguration celebration -- along with that bridge scandal. Add to that increased frequency of snowfall a quick CNN weather factoid: Over the last week, was snow on the ground in 49 of 50 states. Oh, Britannia . Following the jet-stream across the North Atlantic, things get warmer, but also, much, much wetter. London is used to rain, but this? The River Thames has burst its banks. What British meteorologists say makes it sound like they may have already heard NOAA's Lapenta mention of hovering, long-lasting storms. The Met Office, the UK's national weather service, said the recent series of winter storms ""has been exceptional in its duration, and has led to the wettest December to January period in the UK since records began."" Some communities in low-lying areas in southwest England are looking more like the water-bound city of Venice, Italy. They have been under water since December. And there's no letup in sight just yet. Authorities have warned communities along the Thames that more flooding is on its way, as the river reaches its highest level in 60 years. A powerful Atlantic storm that is blowing in on Friday will add to people's woes. Where's that coming from? It's what's left of a storm that plastered the United States with snow and ice. Let it snow! Photos of Olympic cross-country skiers striding for miles in the snow in short sleeves were all the rage this week. They illustrate how warm it has been in Sochi, Russia, at the Winter Games. Low temperatures have been well above freezing, and daytime highs have hit the 50's, NOAA says. Spectators may find it pleasant to walk around in light jackets -- or amusing to sit in the sun in shorts and t-shirts. But for the organizers, the warm weather, which Lapenta says is strongly influenced by that same jet-stream, has been no laughing matter. They've had to crank up snow machines to keep some pistes white. Sochi has been one of the warmest cities to host the winter Games, NOAA says on its website. But that's not really shocking, the climate agency says. ""Sochi sits in a marginally wintry zone along the Black Sea coast near the Caucasus Mountains,"" it says. But with the current jet-stream pattern, marginally wintry does not seem to be enough to hold back balmier air. Luckily, many events are being held indoors or at higher, colder elevations. Blasts of warm weather at Winter Olympic Games is nothing new, and it has been worse before. ""In 2010, Vancouver, Canada experienced its warmest January ever recorded,"" NOAA says. Snow machines were powerless against it, so organizers had to ship in snow by truck and helicopter. NOAA advises that the Olympic Committee should consider awarding the Games to cities in solidly cold regions -- as global warming increases. That leads to a pertinent question that is often on people's minds when the weather goes haywire these days. Yes or No . Can we chalk this wacko winter up to climate change? Lapenta would like to know, too. Cracking that code will be very complicated. But there is something else that baffles his team. Why has the jet-stream gotten to be so slow this year? ""That's an area of research that we're currently investigating. We don't have a clear-cut answer to that question,"" he said. If climate scientists can make that connection, it will allow them to better predict weather craziness as much as a month or two ahead of time, Lapenta said. So we'll all know what we've got coming. CNN's Miguel Marquez, Laura Smith-Spark and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Yep, this is unusual; NOAA says so -- and, in part, why .
The odd weather pattern stretches from California to Russia .
It includes the Southwest's drought, the recent blasts of snow, UK flooding .
And it's warming the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi ."
"(CNN) -- In 2009, du Pont heir Robert H. Richards IV, 47, was convicted of raping his 3-year-old daughter and served no jail time because, a judge said, he would ""not fare well"" in prison. You are only just hearing about this travesty thanks to a civil suit filed recently by Richards' ex-wife, Tracy Richards, alleging that he also sexually abused his 19-month-old son during the same period. How does this happen? Lady Justice wears a blindfold that's supposed to represent objectivity. Unfortunately, it seems to blind her in some cases, especially when a defendant is wealthy and connected. And Richards is wealthy and connected -- he's the heir to not one, but two fortunes provided to him by his predecessors. In 2008, Richards was indicted on two counts of second-degree child rape for sexually penetrating his daughter repeatedly from 2005 to 2007. Those two counts would have carried mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years each. He was released on $60,000 bail. Richards is unemployed, but with a trust fund and apparently had plenty of cash to hire one of the state's top law firms. His lawyers pushed until Delaware prosecutors offered a deal allowing him the fourth-degree rape plea -- normally reserved for statutory rape cases -- and Richards admitted the assault. At the sentencing, Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden ordered Richards to attend a sex offender rehabilitation program and pay a whopping $4,395 to the Delaware Violent Crimes Compensation Board. (That'll teach him!) She then sentenced him to eight years in prison, but suspended the prison time and put him on probation instead, writing: ""Defendant will not fare well in Level 5 setting."" Translation for the rest of the world: The rich rapist will ""fare well"" living as a free man in a house where he raped his own daughter. A few points here: . 1. The purpose of prison is twofold -- to keep criminals segregated from their victims and the rest of society, to punish them by denying them the freedoms that law-abiding citizens enjoy and to rehabilitate them. Prisons are loaded with pedophile rapists who are incarcerated regardless of their ability to deal with the prison environment. If Richards was a relative of the Dipshots, instead of the du Ponts he'd probably be behind bars now. 2. And if the rapist doesn't ""fare well"" in prison, how is he a good fit for society? As far as I'm concerned, a sex offender who rapes his own child will never ""fare well"" in society. You can't cure sex offenders of their sexual urges, you can only teach them to try to control them. In the meantime, we have a duty to keep rapists like Richards contained in a location where they have no contact or opportunity to hurt another child for a good long time -- and that place is in jail. 3. The Delaware justice system appears to have also lost sight of Richards' victim -- his own kid! Think she'll ""fare well"" knowing her rapist was sent home to his mansion and never properly punished? The sentence was outrageous, but blaming the judge is too easy. The truth is the entire system is to blame. People with zero resources to properly defend themselves are funneled into the prison system, while rich rapists like Richards can buy an excellent criminal defense team and secure a deal no public defender could ever dream of getting. But Tracy Richards has not given up. She filed a suit last month seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of her children. In addition to detailing the abuse of his daughter, the lawsuit also alleges that while Roberts was on probation, he admitted to the sexual abuse of his toddler son. It cites probation reports from two different probation officers notifying the Courts in 2010 and 2012 about that suspected abuse. According to the lawsuit, which is supported by paperwork from the earlier criminal case, Richards went into his daughter's room while she slept and penetrated her with his fingers while he masturbated. The suit also alleges that Richards then told the girl ""to keep what he had done to her a secret."" The girl eventually told her grandmother, who informed Tracy Richards. The girl then recounted the abuse to her pediatrician and New Castle County police, who arrested him. Given all this background, it may seem like a slam dunk of a civil suit, but societal factors -- the advantages of money-- can play a large role in the justice system. You can be certain that if Richards lives off a trust, it's one that du Pont family attorneys have painstakingly set up, and it's probably going to be remarkably hard to pierce. Likely knowing she's in for a fight, Tracy Richards has hired law firm Jacobs & Crumplar, attorneys more than capable of going after people who think they are untouchable. This is the firm that won victims $77.4 million in a settlement with the Catholic Diocese of Wilmington over sex abuse by a priest. I've got my fingers crossed that a civil jury will award jaw-dropping damages in this case and strip Richards of the trust fund and the wealthy status that allowed him to avoid jail -- where he really belongs.","Mel Robbins: Du Pont heir Robert Richards did no jail time in rape of his toddler daughter .
Sentencing judge said, in part, he ""would not fare well"" in prison. This is not justice .
Robbins: Wealth shouldn't shield him from justice .

"(CNN) -- White tents line the sides of the valley where the landslide struck. Some villagers weep, others pray. The remnants of their shattered community lies buried below, submerged under as much as 60 meters of mud. In the space of one devastating week, natural disasters killed more people in Afghanistan than they did all last year. At the heart of the destruction was the double landslide that engulfed a village in a remote northeastern province on Friday, killing more than 2,000 people. A mass of rock and mud that came crashing down in the village of Abi Barak, in Badakhshan Province. ""The scale of this landslide is absolutely devastating, with an entire village practically wiped away,"" said Richard Danziger, the chief of mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Afghanistan. ""Hundreds of families have lost everything and are in immense need of assistance."" Over the weekend, authorities gave up hope of finding anybody alive. They suspended rescue operations, and declared the site a mass graveyard. Double blow . The first landslide on Friday swallowed at least 300 homes. When residents from a nearby village rushed to the scene to help dig people out, the second landslide struck, sweeping away many of the rescuers. Exact figures are difficult to come by. But IOM staff on the ground said the double landslide killed as many as 2,700 people and affected 14,000 others. One woman lost all seven members of her family, said IOM spokesman Matt Graydon, who visited the area Sunday. The disaster wiped out acres of farmland and cut off local access to drinking water, making clean water one of the critical priorities for aid workers on the ground. Relief agencies are struggling to get vital supplies to the area, but it's a challenge. Badakhshan is a remote, mountainous region of Afghanistan. The location, said Danzinger, makes it extremely challenging to transport heavy equipment and other supplies into the area. A day of mourning . Sunday was declared a national day of mourning for victims of the disaster. TV and radio stations suspended the broadcast of entertainment programming out of respect to the victims. In a statement, President Hamid Karzai expressed his deep sadness by the loss of life and property caused by landslide. He also promised that a high-ranking government delegation would travel to the affected area. The landslide followed days of flash floods across nine northern Afghan provinces that killed more than 160 people, displaced 16,000 others and affected a further 50,000, according to a bulletin from the International Federation of the Red Cross. ""There have now been more Afghans killed through natural disasters in the past seven days than all of 2013,"" said Mark Bowden, U.N. Humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan. Afghanistan mourns landslide victims .","The death toll from a double landslide may be as high as 2,700, a relief agency says .

"(EW.com) -- If you're like me, rose lovers, you were perfectly content to watch ""The Bachelor: Sean and Catherine's Wedding"" from the comfort of your own couch. But a few weeks ago, I received word that 84-year-old Bachelor superfan — and occasional EW.com Bachelor correspondent — Nanny, wanted to be there to witness Sean and Catherine's special day. Clearly, I had to make this happen. After telling the good people at ABC and Warner Bros. about Nanny (and sending them some links to her brilliant commentary, like this, and this, and this), they knew there was simply no way this wedding could proceed without her. And so Nanny and her daughter Brenna packed their bags and flew from Oklahoma to Santa Barbara, where I met them at the Four Seasons Hotel two hours before the ceremony began. As we waited to be escorted to the garden where the ceremony was being held, we watched a steady stream of former Bachelor and Bachelorette contestants — Jason and Molly, Trista and Ryan, Desiree and Chris — filter through the lobby in their formal attire. Bachelor ring master Neil Lane made an appearance, as did Sean's fellow Dancing with the Stars contestants Lisa Vanderpump and Andy Dick. ""We really bonded on Dancing with the Stars,"" Andy told us. Doing the show, he said, was ""like being in the basement with someone during a hurricane. We bonded because we were in hell!"" Eventually some black-clad crew members ushered us outside into a sort of patio/holding pen area, where guests drank wine and huddled around space heaters. Fortunately this gave us some time to snap lots of pictures of Nanny with some of her favorite citizens of Bachelor Nation, including Jason and Molly, Chris and Des, Trista and Ryan, Ashley and JP, and Arie Luyendyk. (""I like Arie real well,"" she purred after the handsome race car driver was out of earshot.) By this time it was about 5:15 pacific time, so the broadcast had already begun on the east coast, and the producers were having guests file into the ceremony in groups during the commercial breaks. Once at our seats, we were instructed not to sit down, because periodically the camera would go live to host Chris Harrison — who was standing atop a platform in front of the rows of seats — and I guess seeing a bunch of people sitting down behind him with their backs to him would have looked odd on TV . While guests waited for the big event to begin, they chatted with each other and shivered in the chilly, 56-degree night air. It was so cold that eventually Lisa Vanderpump wrapped her little dog Giggy — yes, she brought Giggy — in a blanket. Trista and Ryan took a selfie, while nearby Ashley insisted that pregnant DeAnna Stagliano — former Bachelorette DeAnna Pappas, who's now married to Bachelor Pad champ Michael Stagliano's brother — sit in the cushioned arm chair in their row rather the regular hardback chair. Later DeAnna, Trista, Ashley, and Ali gathered together to pose for a Bachelorette all-star snapshot. We weren't allowed to sit down until about 6:15, when Sean and Catherine's grandparents walked down the aisle. Shortly after that, three crew members stood at the altar — two of them clasping hands and one of them ""officiating"" — to give the camera team and lighting crew a chance to make sure everything was in order before the happy couple arrived. Next, Sean Lowe appeared and strode down the aisle with his mom, Sherry, and dad, Jay, who accompanied him up to the altar to officiate. It was time for the endless procession of bridesmaids and groomsmen, and as they arrived guests could hear the director barking orders and giving feedback to his team. ""They came out really fast and they're talking to each other!"" he barked into his headset after the first couple proceeded down the aisle. Once the entire party was assembled, it was time for the big moment... a commercial break! When the cameras weren't rolling, guests resumed their conversations and checked their phones, while Sean stood quietly at the altar, his eyes fixed on the arch at the end of the garden where his bride-to-be would emerge. Finally, the music began to play (a tropical-sounding instrumental version of Michael Jackson's ""Human Nature"") and Catherine arrived, flanked by her parents. Though guests were asked to keep their phones away during the ceremony, I spotted several folks taking stealth videos and snapshots, including Arie, who leaned over his seatmate (and former rival for Emily's love, Jef Holm) to get a shot of Sean and Catherine taking their vows. The majority of the ceremony aired on TV, though part of it continued through a commercial break, as Jay led the guests in a prayer for Sean and Catherine. ""We pray, Father, that you will strengthen their love day by day,"" he said, adding that he hoped for them to live as ""ambassadors for Christ."" During this lovely moment, a cameraman ensconced in the bushes to the right of the stage let out a loud burp — his second of the night — but I'm hoping it was drowned out by Jay's amplified voice. Despite the long wait for the ceremony to begin, it apparently didn't take long enough to fill all two hours. After Sean and Catherine were declared man and wife and the processional filed back down the aisle, the director's voice rang out: ""How much time do we have to kill?"" Though all of the guests were thinking Please God don't let it be more than a minute because we are freezing!, the director informed us that we should move into the aisle and ""mingle"" so that Chris Harrison could interview JP and Ashley on camera about the beautiful celebration of reality TV romance they had just witnessed. And with that, it was a wrap for the fourth ever Bachelor/Bachelorette franchise wedding. And Nanny, for one, was over the moon. ""I think it was something extra special that Sean's dad did the service,"" she told me. Her eyes were shining, and I asked her if she cried during the ceremony. ""Of course!"" she answered. ""And I'm not wiping these tears off!"" (Much like Marcia Brady, who'll never wash her cheek again.) Her magical evening wasn't over yet, though. As we were leaving the garden to go back inside, ever-gallant host Chris Harrison approached us to say hello and pose for a picture with Nanny. ""I think you should be the next Bachelor,"" Nanny told him. But Nanny, we asked, who would host the show without Chris? ""I'll host the show!"" she replied. (Your move, Mike Fleiss!) Just before we left the hotel to go back to our regularly scheduled lives, Nanny offered two final thoughts on the evening. ""If I die tomorrow, I'll die with a smile on my face,"" she told us. And then, ""I need to slip Sean my business card with my phone number on it... just in case it doesn't work out."" See the original story at EW.com.

"(Oprah.com) -- Prop stylist Elizabeth Press traces her gift-wrapping prowess to her mother, whose creative, budget-conscious ideas -- like wrapping boxes with painted newspaper comics, pasting gift certificates inside hollowed-out books, and making decorative stamps out of eraser carvings -- proved that a little thoughtfulness goes a long way. ""She really understood presentation,"" Press says. ""Her creativity could turn even inexpensive gifts into something fabulous."" Now Press has her own cost-saving tricks. To achieve a chic, monochromatic effect, she says, ""let leftovers be your guide."" If you have lime-colored ribbon from Easter, use green paper. And forget traditional holiday color combinations: Pair pink with red, yellow with gold. 1. Keep it monochromatic . Combining any two shades of the same color ""is a straightforward scheme that looks really modern,"" says Press. FYI: Matte, solid-color papers tend to cost less. Oprah.com: How to personalize your gift wrap . 2. Add nontraditional accents . Unexpected finishing touches are likely sitting idle in your drawers and closets. Instead of tying a bow, use cord to attach an ornament or dreidel; pin a brooch or faux flower onto ribbon; top children's gifts with chocolate coins or a glued-on toy. Press particularly loves to decorate with alphabet stamps, spelling out the recipient's name or initials, because ""they instantly make a present feel personalized."" How to make your own stamps . What you'll need: . 1. A rubber eraser (at least two inches wide) or a large potato sliced in half widthwise. 2. A marker to draw a simple shape on the eraser or sliced potato. 3. An X-Acto knife to carve away the eraser (or a kitchen knife for the potato), leaving the raised shape. 4. Water-based paint -- or a leftover can of acrylic wall paint, diluted in a bowl. Brush the paint onto your carving, test it on scrap paper, and stamp up your ribbon, paper, etc., in random patterns. ""The idea is for it to look fun and homemade, not perfect,"" stresses Press. Oprah.com: How to tie a bow . 3. Think outside the white cardboard box . Pick up colorful, inexpensive containers from stores like Pier 1, or use Chinese-takeout cartons from a party store (perfect for cookies and candy,) tea towels or scarves (ideal for wine bottles and other odd-shaped offerings,) and ID-badge sleeves (fun holders for gift cards.) ""You don't need wrapping paper if you have pretty fabric or containers,"" Press says. 4. Focus on the bows . For about $50 at stores like Staples, you can buy hundreds of feet (years' worth!) of kraft paper. Use it for all your presents, then dress them up with colorful ribbons. Classic hangtags give an old-fashioned ""special delivery!"" effect. 5. Personalize your paper . Use a printer to make unique backdrops: a color photo of you with the gift recipient, a Googled image of an Impressionist painting, a vintage map.

"London (CNN) -- L'Oreal harnessed the French reputation for elegance to become a global cosmetics giant -- and the company's CEO says European economies should apply similar logic to escape their current woes. Jean-Paul Agon, L'Oreal's chair and chief executive, said European countries need to identify areas of expertise to succeed in the global marketplace -- just like companies. ""You have to specialize yourself in some areas where you are going to be [in] the top league worldwide,"" he said. European countries had great potential if they could only find their niche, he added. ""Europe could be rich (given) the diversity of its countries, the diversity of its expertise, as long as each country is able to maximize its success, its potential in its own field."" Agon has worked for L'Oreal since joining the company in 1978, with stints heading its operations in Greece and Germany -- an experience he said had given him unusual insight into Europe's current predicament. ""Based on this experience, I can see that it is very difficult for these two countries to live under the same currency,"" he said. ""I think the German economy is successful because they have found their role in the worldwide economy. I think Greece has also to define what they can be good at, and what they will be known for, and famous for around the world."" Identifying France's particular area of economic potential should be a priority issue in the upcoming election, he said. ""France has talents that no other country [has] ... in terms of luxury, in terms of technology. This is something the world needs and France has a great role to play."" Other European countries needed to do the same thing -- then work in unison as a cohesive economic bloc. France and other countries of Europe needed to unite and define objectives and ambitions, he said. Each economy was now competing in a global marketplace, ""whether we like it or not,"" he said. ""If a country, like a company, wants to develop its business -- to grow -- it has to grab business from all around the world."" To that end, Agon said he expected emerging markets would drive L'Oreal's expansion in the immediate future. Growth is likely to come from China and Brazil, he said, where the middle classes are booming. ""You have hundreds of millions of consumers really want [ing] access to these products,"" he said.","L'Oreal's CEO says that Europe's economies need to find their global niche .

"(CNN) -- The man is strapped onto a gurney and restrained, yet he is singing, making faces and twitching. ""You know where you're at?"" a paramedic asks him, but Freddy Sharp can't answer. He was, he explained later, off in his own world after overdosing on synthetic drugs known as ""bath salts."" ""I'd never experienced anything like that,"" Sharp told CNN's Don Lemon. ""It really actually scared me pretty bad."" KDVR: Colorado 'Bath Salts' ban signed into law . He said he was hallucinating about being in a mental hospital and being possessed by Jason Voorhees, the character from the ""Friday the 13th"" movies. ""I just felt all kinds of crazy,"" said Sharp, now 27, of Tennessee, who says he hasn't used bath salts in months. ""It felt so evil. It felt like the darkest, evilest thing imaginable."" The drug made national headlines recently after a horrific crime in Miami, where a naked man chewed the face off a homeless man in what has been called a zombie-like attack. Video footage captured by surveillance cameras on the nearby Miami Herald building shows the 18-minute attack, which ended when police shot and killed a man identified as Rudy Eugene, 31. The footage shows a man walking along a sidewalk and stopping in a shaded area created by the tramway bridge. He apparently attacks the victim, dragging him out from the shade, stripping the victim's clothes off and beating him as the victim kicks his legs in an apparent attempt to fight back. He then spends several minutes crouched over the victim. ""The guy just kept eating the other guy, like ripping his skin,"" witness Larry Vega told CNN affiliate WSVN. Police told CNN affiliate WPLG that when officers arrived and told him to stop, the man growled like an animal and continued eating the victim's face. Overheard on CNN.com: Are we all 'zombies'? Authorities said they suspected the attacker was under the influence of bath salts. The victim is in critical condition at a Miami hospital. Not the same substance used to scent your bathwater, bath salts contain amphetamine-like chemicals such as methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) and are sold as ""cocaine substitutes"" or ""synthetic LSD."" Its effects include paranoia, hallucinations, convulsions and psychotic episodes. Why 'bath salts' are dangerous . ""This is a terrible drug because it takes a combination of methamphetamine, and the paranoia and the aggressiveness, and LSD, the hallucinations, and PCP, the extreme paranoia that you get, combines it into one, and has unpredictable effects on human behavior,"" Paul Adams, an emergency room doctor in Miami, told CNN. The drug remains legal in some states, although many others have taken steps to ban the substances. But sometimes, when one chemical used in bath salts is banned, another chemical is substituted to skirt the law, said attorney Alex Manning. ""People are making this stuff out of household products, stuff that's in their kitchens,"" she said. It can take ""five or six grown men"" to restrain a bath salts user, she said. ""It's PCP on crack."" And cases are on the rise, Adams said. Police in Panama City, Florida, said last year they had seen two violent incidents linked to use of bath salts. In one, a woman allegedly tried to behead her 71-year-old mother; in the second, a man on bath salts used his teeth to tear up the back seat of a patrol car. Sharp said he never felt the urge to ""eat anybody's flesh"" while under the influence of bath salts, but noted, ""You feel like you're 10 feet tall and bulletproof, and you actually do not feel any pain."" He said he himself ""just got paranoid."" But he said his overdose -- was a turning point, describing it as ""Fear. Darkness. It felt like impending doom was coming down on me ... I felt like I was about to bust loose and actually hurt somebody."" He recalled trying to calm himself unsuccessfully. ""I felt like if I lost that control, anything could happen,"" he said. The experience, he said, was the worst of his life. And coming off the drug was also difficult, he said. Besides the withdrawal, ""whenever it comes out of you, you can smell it in your hair. It's so nasty."" He described the smell as a ""unclean, nasty, unkempt, chemically-type smell."" Asked what he would say to other users, Sharp said, ""The only thing I can say to them is that if you value your life, you'll stop it and you won't do it anymore, because it will destroy your life. It will destroy your family. It will destroy everything."" CNN's Brad Lendon, Deb Feyerick and Ann Curley contributed to this report.","A former bath salts user says his overdose was the worst experience of his life .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House Ethics Committee prepared Friday to dismiss charges of alleged wrongdoing against California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, ending a tumultuous investigation that lasted roughly three years and may have cost taxpayers up to $1.3 million. Waters has been accused of improperly seeking government assistance for OneUnited Bank, a minority-owned bank in which her husband held a financial interest, during the 2008 financial meltdown. The bank received $12 million in bailout funds. The 11-term Los Angeles-area congresswoman repeatedly insisted her efforts were part of a broader push to help minority-controlled financial institutions during the crisis. A special counsel, attorney Billy Martin, has determined ""there is not sufficient evidence in the record to prove violations"" of House rules, said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, head of a subcommittee examining the matter. Goodlatte, stressing that panel members are prepared to follow Martin's recommendation, made his remarks during a rare public ethics hearing held hours before the House adjourned for the fall campaign season. Martin did conclude, however, that Waters Chief of Staff Mikael Moore -- the congresswoman's grandson -- engaged in ""specific actions"" that ""are in fact violations of the standards and rules of the House regarding conflicts of interest,"" Goodlatte noted. Moore has insisted he was unaware of Waters' financial interest in OneUnited when he repeatedly sought to intervene on the bank's behalf. The ethics panel, following Martin's guidance, may issue a letter of reproval to Moore. Kentucky Rep. John Yarmuth, the top Democrat on the subcommittee, called the matter ""complicated,"" and said Waters ""faced a difficult balancing act between representing minority banks and avoiding a conflict due to her own financial interests."" Waters attended Friday's hearing, but did not address the panel or speak to members of the media. Moore told panel members he had a ""heavy heart,"" and said the idea that he ""disrespected the House is a very difficult pill to swallow."" Over the course of the ethics panel's lengthy investigation, Waters accused committee members of violating her constitutional right to a speedy and public trial, and railed against the secrecy surrounding the panel's proceedings. Among other things, Waters questioned the propriety of communications between GOP committee members and staff investigators. Last winter, six members of the panel, including five Republicans, recused themselves from the investigation. Defenders of the top African-American legislator also raised questions about the role of race in the panel's investigation. In the summer of 2011, Martin was hired to take charge of the investigation -- at a cost of up to $800,000. Last month, House Ethics Committee members voted unanimously to spend as much as another $500,000, further retaining Martin as special counsel. The initial investigation of Waters was led by the nonpartisan Office of Congressional Ethics, which was established in 2008 at the prompting of then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California. The office referred the matter to the House Ethics Committee in the summer of 2009.","Ethics Committee ready to dismiss charges of alleged wrongdoing by congresswoman .

"(CNN) -- A man who pleaded guilty to perpetrating a hoax by falsely reporting that his son was drifting over eastern Colorado in a balloon maintains the incident was not part of a plan for fame in an interview with CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Richard Heene pleaded guilty in November to a felony count of attempting to influence a public servant, and was sentenced last month to 90 days in custody, to begin January 11. He also must serve four years on probation and complete 100 hours of community service each year. But Heene, in an interview airing Friday, told CNN's Larry King he pleaded guilty to save his wife, Mayumi, from being deported to Japan. ""I had to do it to save my family and my wife,"" he said, according to interview excerpts released Wednesday. ""... We had applied years ago for some paperwork. Things got fouled up. We had to reapply so she should have been an American citizen by now, but anyway. I can't -- I can't break up my family."" Mayumi Heene pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of false reporting to authorities in the incident involving the couple's 6-year-old son, Falcon. She was sentenced to 20 days in jail, but her term will begin after her husband's sentence ends, so their children will have a parent able to care for them. Told about Heene's statements, Larimer County, Colorado, Sheriff Jim Alderden told King, ""Quite honestly, I'm shocked that he would make such statements. ""The evidence against Mr. Heene and Mayumi at this point is really overwhelming. There is no doubt in my mind that this thing was a hoax, and I really doubt that there's very few people in America who don't understand at this point that this was an elaborate hoax perpetrated by Richard and Mayumi."" At the Heenes' sentencing, prosecutors outlined what they said was planning for the balloon flight, which they said was aimed at generating publicity for the couple, who sought a reality television show. The incident occurred in October, when a large silver balloon came loose from its moorings in the Heenes' yard and drifted over eastern Colorado. Mayumi Heene called 911 and said Falcon was inside the craft. Millions of people across the country watched the saga on television for nearly two hours as military aircraft tracked the balloon in the air and rescuers chased it below. But in the interview airing Friday, Heene grew emotional as he recounted searching the house ""high and low"" for his son. ""You know, after I saw him in and out of this craft, and Bradford [Falcon's brother] told me that he went inside, at first I didn't believe Bradford,"" Heene told King. ""And I told him that perhaps he's around. I just -- I just saw him."" ""Sum and substance, you believed your son was in the craft?"" King asked. ""I knew he was in the craft when I ..."" Heene began. ""Well, you didn't know it, of course,"" King said. ""No, no, no. In my mind,"" Heene said. ""In my mind. There was no other place, 'cause I visualized him. I yelled at him to -- to not go in."" The night of the incident, during an interview with ""Larry King Live,"" the boy gave authorities what Alderden called an ""Aha! moment."" ""You guys said we did this for the show,"" Falcon said in the interview, when his father asked him why he had not come out from hiding when his parents were looking for him. At the time, the Heenes said their son was simply confused. Authorities said Mayumi Heene later admitted the whole thing was a hoax and that Falcon was safe in their home the whole time. Asked about his son's remark in the interview, conducted last week, Heene said, ""Well, first off, let's take into consideration he's only been speaking English and just learned 3½ years prior to that. He's 6 years old during this interview, number one. Number two, I had gotten back into the house after the initial -- talking to the press out in front of my house. I had opened the garage door to get my family back inside away from these guys. And I looked over, and there was 30 to 40 camera guys. I asked Falcon after that, I asked him -- I said, 'Why did you say that? What are you talking about?' And he said a Japanese cameraman from some -- old man, Johnny Camera, asked him to show him how he got into the attic for his TV show. That's why Falcon answered that."" But, he said, his son was not implying the family staged the incident for a reality show. The full interview will air at 9 p.m. ET Friday.","Richard and Mayumi Heene said son was aloft in runaway homemade balloon .

"(CNN) -- If ever there was a place for ghost stories, it's Cornwall -- the rugged peninsula of southwest England that tumbles into the Atlantic Ocean. Already remote, this often windswept corner was further isolated earlier this year when horrendous storms severed its only rail link, prompting round-the-clock efforts to reconnect it. So it seems only fitting that, when I visit the region, I do so in the company of a long-dead novelist, playwright and poet with a penchant for the paranormal. That's not to say I'm accompanied by a ghost as I make the five-hour rail journey from London's Paddington Station, although a spectral Victorian lady would be quite at home in the retro carriages of the Night Riviera Sleeper -- one of Britain's last intercity cabin trains. Nevertheless, Catharine Amy Dawson Scott, who died in 1935 at the age of 69, is with me in spirit thanks to a vintage guidebook she penned while living on the north Cornish coast. Spooky novels . Published in 1911, the stilted prose of ""Nooks and Corners of Cornwall"" is a far cry from the exuberance of today's travel guides, but the book's claim that the region rewards repeat visits is enough to inspire my own return. My destination is ""Wastehills,"" the house that Dawson Scott lived in for several years, entertaining guests such as English playwright Noel Coward, and drawing inspiration for spooky novels such as ""The Haunting."" A formidable literary presence, Dawson also co-founded PEN International, a pressure group that defends writers' freedom of speech, and that was a staunch campaigner for women's rights. I don't linger at my first stop, Newquay -- a party-loving gateway to the region's many beaches -- jumping in a cab and heading north. Fifteen minutes later I'm at The Scarlet (Tredragon Road, Mawgan Porth, +44 1637 861800) a luxury eco-hotel and spa with an enviable clifftop position overlooking the surfing beach of Mawgan Porth and the epic 1,014-kilometer South West Coast path, one of the world's most spectacular oceanside hikes. The hotel's welcoming, relaxed vibe leads into spa treatments in womb-like tents, green technology and paintings by local artists. 'Lovely and lonely' Next stop is Constantine Bay, a 10-minute bus or car ride northeast along the coast. This wild and windswept arc of sand and rock pools is one of Britain's best surfing beaches and was once a favorite destination for Margaret Thatcher. We're in prime Dawson Scott territory here and, although the beach is thronged in summer with splashing families, the book says it's a ""lovely and lonely bay."" There are great walks in either direction -- to Treyarnon Bay, with its natural swimming pool, across an easy stretch of headland, or Trevose Head Lighthouse and Booby's Bay which, despite the comedic name, is described by Dawson Scott as ""somewhat eerie."" Back in Constantine Bay, home for the next few nights is Sailaway (from $1,389 per week), a stylish split-level beach retreat that touts itself as eco-friendly. After I settle in, Ben, a sailor whose parents built Sailaway, takes me over the lane to Wastehills. Dawson Scott's old home, now owned by Ben's family, is set in lush and tropical gardens that feature a giant tree house. It feels like the haunt of a literary figurehead -- cozy, lived-in, casually elegant and adorned with family photographs. Ben tells me that sometimes he feels a presence in the house, often shutting doors at night only to later find them wide open. Is it, we wonder, the ghost of Dawson Scott? Later we head to Padstow, a working fishing port on the mouth of the Camel Estuary. Dawson Scott describes this popular seaside town a ""little place with narrow streets all running uphill,"" which despite its exposure to the sea ""still contrives to exist."" Bitter/sweet . No stranger to unhappy endings, Dawson Scott may have seen doom and destruction here -- ""The Haunting"" ends with a ghost-haunted murderer awaiting a soggy fate as waters rise around him in a coastal Cornish cave. Given that she wrote a guidebook to the region, it's more likely she hoped for a thriving future. She wouldn't have been disappointed. These days Padstow attracts hordes of foodies headed for local venues such as The Cornish Arms (Churchtown, St. Merryn Padstow, +44 1841 520288), a dining pub owned by cookery writer Rick Stein. The Michelin-starred Paul Ainsworth at No. 6, (6 Middle St., Padstow, +44 01841 532093) is a converted 18th-century townhouse where I choose from a menu that includes Cornish hake with saffron Milanese, salmon with beetroot and sea emulsion. I finish with a malt espresso crÃ¨me brulee with doughnuts -- a perfect blend of bitter and sweet that matches the tone of Dawson Scott's travel writing. It's a good moment to savor her verdict of Cornwall. ""There is so much to interest, so much to see -- almost too much it would seem,"" she writes. ""But Cornwall is a place to go to again and again, to go to till it seems as your own land."" Perhaps, like the ghosts of her novels, she's still around doing precisely that.

Her writing has appeared in numerous web sites, newspapers and magazines.","With retro carriages, the Night Riviera Sleeper is one of Britain's last intercity cabin trains .

"(CNN) -- Step by step, in the soft sweet light just before dawn, we climb a knife edge of Namibian sand. We are walking up one of what are said to be the world's tallest dunes. One dune called ""Big Daddy"" rises 380 meters, or about a quarter-mile, from its base, soaring above the hardscrabble scrub-brush and acacia-dotted landscape of western Namibia's Namib-Naukluft desert. This area, known as Sossusvlei, is remote, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) south-southwest of the capital, Windhoek, and an equal distance southeast from Walvis Bay. But it is worth the long desert drive. The dunes at Sossusvlei are a natural wonder of the world. The sand beneath our feet is powdery, as soft as talcum. Weather and water have crushed it. There are no rocks and no trees on the dunes' steep slopes, just scattered patches of grass. The night winds and dry sand prevent the rest. There are only the fresh footprints of the few people leading the way up the sharp, narrow crest of the dune. The slopes fall away just a step on either side. We have to stop to safely gaze across the barren valley at the silhouetted outlines of more towering dunes, set against the now dark but slowly lightening sky. It's difficult in the early morning to see the color. But as the sun slowly rises, for a few more minutes invisible just below the horizon, the dunes' rich deep orange-red colors begin to emerge. Send in your shots from Namibia . The reason we, and so many others, have come here is for the moment just minutes away, when the sun will suddenly blast above the edge of the parched earth, revealing a landscape that's at once starkly beautiful, sensationally dramatic and incredibly rare. Geologists will tell you that Namibia's dunes are built and shaped by wind and carved by water. They are believed to be 60 million to 80 million years old, made of sand pushed inland over the eons from the coast by Atlantic Ocean winds that sweep onshore 80 kilometers to the west. Here, near the settlement of Sesriem, westerly winds from the Naukluft Mountains to the east collide with the Atlantic winds, stopping the dunes' advance. When the wind from the west meets the wind from the east, the sand is pushed upward like the ocean waves the dunes resemble. It forms almost perfectly symmetrical ""star"" dunes, each with several arms extending outward from the summit. The eastern mountains don't face the entire expanse of dunes, so the wind cuts the Sossusvlei valley into a ""U"" shape. The result is a region of sharply defined massive sculpted sand piles surrounding a vast valley. Water too has shaped this region, although mostly it is long gone. The ephemeral Tsauchab River flows nearby, but only during rainy periods. The water storms through the dune valley, but the dunes stop its advance. It pushes forward and gathers into small lakes at the base of the dunes but often quickly dries up. In a few spots, the water remains, forming shallow marshlands called ""vlei"" (pronounced ""vlay"") that support trees, birds, frogs and other small wildlife. Grasses provide food for springbok, gemsbok and oryx. Quiz: What do you know about the rest of Namibia? In most places, though, are the remains of dried-up marshlands, barren clay and salt basins that contain the dunes' dramatic foil: the dead acacia or ""camel thorn"" trees. Their black, twisted, petrified remains are said to be as old as 900 years, the harsh remnants of the life that once thrived in the now-vanished lakes. Black pied crows perch in their dead branches and then suddenly take off in flocks to surf the swirling breezes around the dunes. The most prominent dead lake is called, appropriately, Deadvlei. It is a broad basin of parched ground surrounded by dunes. It is accessible along a dirt and sand path that crosses smaller dunes on one end. As we walk over the crest, the bone-dry basin appears below. Once, centuries ago, there was a lake here. Now, blackened petrified acacias rise hauntingly from the hard vlei floor. Jennifer Lopez once filmed a scene here for the movie ""The Cell."" The lunar ground crackles slightly beneath our feet as we walk out to the tree Lopez posed against. It is a perfect place for science-fiction, but it is very starkly real. The Namib-Naukluft National Park itself is closed at night. Visitors stay at lodges and campgrounds in Sesriem, the settlement outside the park (see accommodation information below). In the darkness before dawn, they drive the 60-kilometer (37-mile) road from Sesriem and line up at the entrance gate, then gingerly navigate the rough road about 5 more kilometers to the first dunes. One needs a high-clearance 4x4 to reach most areas of the valley, including many of the popular sites. It's easy to suddenly drive into deep sand. On one tract, we had to help a family push out their loaded-down 2x4. This is a bad place to ignore sound advice. The most popular dune to climb is called Dune 45. It is easily accessible from the entrance road, and from its crest is where most visitors view the sunrise. From the top, the view is otherworldly. The sun rises and the dunes' color emerges, slowly changing and brightening in the desert's morning light. Ahead of us, waves of dunes twist across the basin. Behind us, sand sweeps back toward the ocean. We sit, take photographs and play a bit in the sand, always mindful of the steep slopes around us. When it comes time to descend, there are two ways down: walk back down along the crest you climbed up or sand-ski down the slope. The second option is very steep and only for the daring. Those who choose the slope hop and zig-zag across and down, as if they're skiing. Many slightly less intrepid visitors try the slope descent sitting. The sand is so soft and deep, and there are no obstacles to hit, but it is a long way down. Still, with just a little care, it is very hard to get hurt. It is a natural playground.Endless exploration, hiking and dune climbing await. From one vlei, we notice tiny movements atop one of the distant dunes, the outlines of two climbers reaching a summit. But visitors must watch the time. By midday, the desert can become blazingly hot, and there is little shade. The footprints of this morning's visitors mark the dunes they have climbed. By noon, most are leaving the park. A vast quiet returns. By nightfall, the winds will pick up again, sweeping across the sand, erasing the footprints. The dunes' slopes will quickly return to what they have been for millennia: soft, silent, unmarked -- ready to dwarf and astonish the next day's visitors. IF YOU GO . Getting there . Sesriem is reached by mostly decent, well-marked roads from Namibia's capital, Windhoek, and from Walvis Bay on the coast. Both cities have international airports, and rental cars including 4x4s are available. The drive from either city takes about 4Â½ hours, and since the goal is to visit Sossusvlei at dawn, it is an overnight trip. Gasoline is sporadically available en route, but the region is remote, and it is wise to fill up before leaving the city and carry some food, water and sunscreen.

"(CNN) -- As Easter comes into view, the thoughts of billions of Christians turn to Jerusalem, to a sacred weekend that includes the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Of course, people regard these events with various degrees of literalness. But Easter retains its power. It is, in fact, the essential Christian celebration, as the Gospels focus hugely on this part of the Jesus story. They describe in slow motion his entry into Jerusalem and the final week leading up to the crucifixion on Good Friday, the uncertain stillness of Holy Saturday, when the world seems to have slipped into total darkness, then the joy of the Resurrection itself, with a sense that boundaries have been broken -- most aggressively, the membrane between life and death. Questions arise, of course. Did Jesus really rise from the dead? What would that look like? Many Christians imagine some literal wakening from the dead and refuse to accept the slightest hint that the Resurrection might be regarded as symbolic without denigrating it. Indeed, if you read the Gospel narratives closely, it's not easy to say what actually happened. All four of them skip the actual Resurrection. That is, we never see Jesus waken. The first inkling of change comes when a few women close to him visit the tomb. Accounts differ on who turned up at the tomb that morning: Mary Magdalene, a close friend of Jesus, alone or with Mary, his mother, and with Salome (who is either Mary's sister or the mother of apostles James and John). In John's Gospel, Mary Magdalene visits the tomb alone. To her amazement, she finds the stone rolled away. In panic, she runs to tell Peter and another (unnamed) disciple, who rush to the tomb and find it empty. They appear to think someone has stolen the body. Meanwhile, Mary Magdalene sits outside the tomb by herself, crying softly. After a while, she walks back into the crypt, where she sees two angels in white. They speak to her, and then a mysterious figure appears at her side to ask her why she's crying. She thinks he's the gardener, then she recognizes the voice if not the face when he calls her by name. She cries: ""Rabboni!"" --in Aramaic, ""teacher."" The post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus vary wildly. For the most part, those who meet him fail to recognize him, as in the story of the Road to Emmaus, where Jesus appears beside two of his followers. They don't recognize him, which suggests that he has not reappeared in a familiar form. Even when he joins them for dinner, they don't know who sits beside them. Only when he prays over the bread before eating do they recognize him, and he immediately disappears -- poof. Even his closest disciples don't know Jesus when they see him, as in John's Gospel, where he appears by the Sea of Galilee to Peter, Thomas, Nathanael and two other disciples. It takes quite a while for Peter, alone among them, to recognize this mysterious figure on the shore who advises them where to catch the fish. A kind of summary of Jesus' post-Resurrection appearances will be found in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians (15:5-8): . ""He appeared to Cephas [Peter], and then to the Twelve. Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom remain alive now, though some have fallen asleep. Then he showed himself to James, then to all the apostles. Finally, he appeared to me."" This letter of Paul is one of the earliest examples of Christian literature, written perhaps 20 years after Jesus died, and it gives us some sense of what stories people were telling about him. The last appearance, alas, hardly counts for much, as it occurs on the Road to Damascus, where Paul hears a voice from the Lord, which says: ""I am Jesus whom you persecute."" (Acts 9:5) When Paul opens his eyes, however, he sees nothing. These accounts of what happened after Easter suggest that a lot of different rumors circulated about the Resurrection, and the four Gospels reflect these divergent stories. And the characteristics of Jesus' resurrected body shift a good deal. In one case, Jesus asks Thomas, the famous doubter, to touch the wound in his side, proving that he's really there. Elsewhere, Jesus passes through locked doors like a ghost -- an unsettling image. In Luke's Gospel, he astonishes his disciples by eating ""a piece of broiled fish"" as well as swallowing honey. For the most part, his appearances retain a dreamlike quality, suggesting that Jesus didn't want anyone to assume that whatever happened to him occurred in ordinary time and space. He did not, like Lazarus, simply get up and walk from the burial crypt and resume life on the street. This is the Resurrection, not the Great Resuscitation. But Christian thinking is Resurrection thinking. It's about rebirth or reawakening in many forms, about spiritual and moral transformation. And this is the really good news of Easter.","Jay Parini: Easter is Christians' most powerful day. People vary on how literal resurrection is .
The Gospel writings about this are unclear on what happened. They skip that part, he says .
He says in post-Resurrection accounts Jesus appears, but he is not recognizable .
Parini: Differing accounts suggest much was rumor. But Easter rebirth message endures ."
"Hong Kong (CNN) -- An elderly woman infected with a strain of avian flu that is rarely seen in humans died in China earlier this month -- marking the first human fatality from the H10N8 virus. The 73-year-old woman in Jiangxi province was admitted to a hospital on November 30, suffering from several ailments including severe pneumonia, hypertension, heart disease and a muscular weakness condition. She died on December 6. The woman had a history of contact with live poultry markets, and had visited a live bird market four days before the onset of her illness, according to the World Health Organization. ""According to expert analysis, initial assessments consider the death as an individual case, and risk of human infection is low,"" a release from China's National Health and Family Planning Commission stated. People who are elderly or immune-compromised, like the patient, are more susceptible to the serious outcomes from flu. The people who had been around the woman were in normal health, according to Chinese health authorities. Dr. Leo Poon, associate professor of public health at the University of Hong Kong said he was not really concerned with a possible spread of H10N8. ""I think this is an outlier,"" he said. This is not the first human case of the H10 subtype, as the virus has jumped from birds to humans before, according to the scientific literature. In 2010, two Australians workers processing abattoir tested positive for a subtype of H10 infection, but their cases were considered mild. The H10N8 avian flu virus has been detected in live bird markets in Guangdong Province in China as well as the Dongting Lake wetland, according to previous scientific reports. Poon said the H7N9 virus, with over 100 confirmed cases in China and two in Hong Kong, is ""far more serious."" That virus, first reported in China in March 2013, is believed to result from exposure to infected poultry. The scope of the disease remains unknown, but has raised concern because most patients with H7N9 have been severely ill and 45 have died. According to the World Health Organization, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of H7N9. Health authorities recommend washing hands, covering nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing. Hong Kong health authorities warned travelers against visiting live poultry markets and to avoid direct contact with poultry, birds and their droppings. CNN's Keng Fe in Beijing and journalist Naomi Ng contributed to this article.","A 73-year-old woman, confirmed to have H10N8 avian flu virus, died .

"(CNN) -- A blue moon is rising. While its rival stumbled at the final furlong, Manchester City held its nerve and claimed the three points which it so badly craved. A 4-0 victory over Aston Villa -- a win which helped take its goal tally to 100 in this season's Premier League, came following a frustrating first half in which the visiting side held firm. In the end, it was Edin Dzeko who finally made the breakthrough, scoring twice in eight minutes to settle the nerves before further strikes from Stevan Jovetic and Yaya Toure sealed the win. City will now go into Sunday's final home with West Ham with its destiny firmly its own hands. A draw will be sufficient to win the title -- but a defeat would allow Liverpool to snatch the crown should it overcome Newcastle at Anfield. ""It was very difficult,"" City defender Pablo Zabaleta told Sky Sports. ""If you don't score early, sometimes it can be hard, but the key was we worked hard, we found space and we stayed patient. ""It was a very solid performance, nothing is won yet but it was very important to win here tonight. ""It was a massive step forward but there is still one game to play. West Ham has nothing to play for but they have some very good players and can score goals. ""The spirit is great here, the players work very hard, we kept the belief when we were in third place and now we are here. We have a great chance and hopefully on Sunday we can celebrate the title."" The margin of victory against Villa would scarcely have been imaginable at halftime with Villa proving stubborn in defense. City, which dominated the opening 45 minutes, failed to find a way past a resolute visiting side. Having watched Liverpool slip up at Crystal Palace, where it contrived to throw away a three-goal lead, it would have been understandable for City's frustration to surface. Instead, it stepped up a gear and when Dzeko fired home Zabaleta's cross from close-range, the shackles were released. The Bosnian tapped home a second when Brad Guzan failed to hold Samir Nasri's effort and Jovetic added a third with a minute of normal time remaining. There was still time for Toure to rampage through the midfield and beat Guzan to notch his side's fourth and City's 100th of the season. ""We played good football in the first half, they didn't have any chances but the manager said just to be calm and we would get what we wanted,"" added Dzeko. ""When the team defends with 10 players in the box, it's always about the first goal. It was very important. Once we got it, gaps opened up and we scored more."" Manuel Pellegrini's men will now prepare for West Ham with the title within touching distance. Elsewhere, Sunderland confirmed its place in next season's Premier League with a 2-0 win over West Bromwich Albion. Jack Colback and Fabio Borini secured the points for Sunderland, which had looked doomed only weeks ago. The result means Norwich City requires a last-day miracle to survive relegation.","Manchester City moves to the top of the Premier League .

"(CNN) -- Text messages sent from Trayvon Martin's cell phone the day he was killed show he had been arguing with someone on the phone and was ""hostile,"" attorneys for George Zimmerman wrote in a recent court filing. Zimmerman's lawyers argue the texts are relevant to the case, in which the unarmed teenager was fatally shot by the neighborhood watch volunteer during a confrontation in a Sanford, Florida, neighborhood in February 2012. The texts speak to Martin's demeanor and emotional state, the Thursday filing said, and ""may assist the jury in understanding why Trayvon Martin chose to hide then confront George Zimmerman rather than simply going home."" The filing said the texts were mostly with ""Witness 8,"" and the messages showed Martin and the friend were ""hostile and angry with each other at various points throughout the day."" Martin, 17, was talking on the phone with Witness 8 when he and Zimmerman met as Martin walked to the house of his father's fiancee after a trip to a nearby convenience store. Zimmerman to argue self-defense, will not seek 'stand your ground' Also in the document, Zimmerman's attorneys say the court should also consider text messages sent before that day, because they establish Martin's marijuana use and fights he had been involved in. ""This (fighting) evidence is admissible in support of Mr. Zimmerman's self-defense claim regarding the abilities and capacity of Trayvon Martin as an experienced fighter,"" Zimmerman's attorneys wrote. The attorney for Martin's family, Benjamin Crump, said Thursday that evidence and other details -- like the defense's assertion that Martin had removable gold tooth caps -- are ""irrelevant."" He predicted they would never be used at Zimmerman's trial. ""Is the defense trying to prove Trayvon deserved to be killed by George Zimmerman because (of) the way he looked?"" Crump asked in a statement. ""If so, this stereotypical and closed-minded thinking is the same mindset that caused George Zimmerman to get out of his car and pursue Trayvon, an unarmed kid who he didn't know. The pretrial release of these irrelevant red herrings is a desperate and pathetic attempt by the defense to pollute and sway the jury pool."" Two previous gag order requests by the prosecution have been denied. George Zimmerman's brother apologizes for offensive tweet . Instead, he said, jurors will focus on Zimmerman's arrest for battery on a police officer, a domestic violence injunction and other issues he said demonstrate a ""propensity for violence."" Other items taken from Martin's phone included text-message discussions of drugs and pictures of a gun and marijuana plants. Lead defense attorney Mark O'Mara said he will try to use the evidence if prosecutors attempt to attack Zimmerman's character during his trial on second-degree murder charges, set to begin next month. Also Thursday, O'Mara filed a request that his client's trial be delayed. Much of the new evidence disclosed Thursday in filings by Zimmerman's attorneys comes from Martin's cell phone, including photos showing a semiautomatic pistol and ammunition and small marijuana plants growing in pots. In another picture, Martin is pictured making obscene gestures in an apparent self-portrait. Others show him with friends and in other settings. Gun, drug texts feature in new Trayvon Martin shooting evidence . Zimmerman recently waived his right to a pretrial hearing under Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which allows people to use deadly force when threatened regardless of where they are. His attorneys will claim self-defense at trial. A representative of the special prosecutor handling the case did not return an e-mail message Thursday seeking comment on the evidence. Prosecutors renewed their motion for a gag order in the case Thursday because, they said, they're concerned about finding an impartial jury given the ""inordinate amount of media coverage."" Two previous gag order requests by the prosecution have been denied. Arrest 'solely to placate the masses,"" Zimmerman's mother writes . In-Session's Jessica Thill and CNN's David Mattingly, Marylynn Ryan, Rich Phillips and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Defense: Trayvon Martin exchanged angry texts on the days he was killed .

"Washington (CNN) -- Grimacing with emotion, entertainment legend Mickey Rooney implored a Senate committee on Wednesday to stop what experts call chronic emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse of elderly Americans by family members and other caregivers. The 90-year-old Rooney told the Senate Special Committee on Aging that he was abused by a family member who took control of his life, and described feeling ""scared, disappointed, yes, and angry."" ""You can't believe that it's happening to you,"" Rooney said. ""You feel overwhelmed."" Rooney has filed a restraining order against his stepson and stepdaughter, claiming both emotional and financial abuse. The committee's hearing brought attention to what experts call chronic elder abuse in America. Rooney said Congress should pass a law to make it a specific crime. ""I'm asking you to stop this elderly abuse. I mean to stop it. Now. Not tomorrow, not next month, but now,"" he shouted from the witness table. Pass legislation and send it to be signed into law by President Barack Obama, he urged, so that the nation can say ""it's a crime and we will not allow it in the United States of America."" Following the hearing, committee Chairman Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisconsin, introduced legislation that would create an Office of Elder Justice within the Department of Justice to help coordinate law enforcement response to elder abuse. According to a report by the Government Accountability Office, more than 14% of noninstitutionalized older adults experienced some form of elder abuse in 2009. The report cautions that number may be lower than the reality because many instances of elder abuse are underreported. ""For years I suffered silently. I didn't want to tell anybody. I couldn't muster the courage and you have to have courage,"" Rooney said Wednesday. ""I needed help and I knew I needed it. Even when I tried to speak up, I was told to shut up and be quiet."" The GAO report found that many Adult Protective Service programs at the state level have growing case loads and dwindling resources. The elder population of the United States is expected to grow by 60% over the next 25 years. Other witnesses detailed the depth of the problem. ""I tell the physicians I train that if they've seen 15 or 20 older people in their practices ... then they have probably met an elder abuse victim, whether they realize it or not,"" said Dr. Mark Lachs, director of geriatrics at the New York Presbyterian Health System. Based on a new study of elder abuse in New York state, ""it would appear that for every elder abuse victim that makes it into an official service or reporting system, another 23 to 24 go undetected,"" Lachs said. Marie-Therese Connolly, director of the group Life Long Justice, told of a man charged by prosecutors in Seattle with murdering his mother. ""His crime? Letting her rot to death with eight huge pressure sores, several to the bone, while he played internet poker and lived off her pension,"" Connolly said. ""His excuse? She didn't want to go to a nursing home or a doctor; he was just respecting her wishes."" According to Connolly, the woman was ""imprisoned in her bed by immobility, dementia and isolation."" ""She moaned and cried out for help continuously in the weeks before her death,"" Connolly said. ""Neighbors closed their windows and her son put in earplugs to muffle her cries. No one called Adult Protective Services or 911. It's hard to believe the response would have been the same had the cries come from a child, a younger woman or a dog."" The witnesses noted that victims of elder abuse put a greater strain on support services by requiring more medical care, housing assistance and other help. Rooney summed up the challenge when he spoke of the personal difficulty that victims of elder abuse face. ""You're afraid, but you're also thinking about your other family members,"" he said, noting concern about potential criticism from ""your family, your friends, people who know them."" ""They might not want to accept the dysfunction,"" Rooney said, adding that ""one should love their families as I do. I love my family."" The diminutive Rooney has been a film star for decades, starting with his role in Andy Hardy films in the 1930s.

"(CNN) -- When might someone who has been pummeled by round, after round, after round of snow wish for, of all things, more snow? When the alternative is ice. Granted, a huge swath of the United States didn't have that option Tuesday. The National Weather Service said a stretch from Wyoming east to Maine was getting socked with snow. Officials in Kansas blamed the weather for the deaths of two people in a car accident in Crawford County. The weather service's website cited winter storm warnings for much of the nation's midsection and into northern New England. CNN's weather unit estimates that 120 million people were in the system's path. Residents of Topeka, Kansas, should see 7 to 11 inches of flakes by the end of the day. Enterprise, 80 miles to the west, had already seen 13 inches of snow by Tuesday evening, CNN affiliate WIBW reported. A Southwest plane at Kansas City International Airport hit a snow bank as the airliner was taxing to the gate, according to airline spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger. Southwest said all customers were safe and at the terminal. But the ice is coming to other parts of the country. Freezing rain warnings have been issued for large parts of Virginia and the Washington metropolitan area, where trees, power lines and roads could be coated by early Wednesday. After enduring a recent record-breaking snow, New Yorkers could get a mix of snow and sleet beginning Tuesday night that could encrust the city with nearly half an inch of ice by Wednesday. On the New Jersey emergency management office's Twitter feed, meteorologist Gary Szatowski said the National Weather Service's ""reasonable worst case scenario"" for parts of that state and others nearby call for 0.75 inches of ice accumulation that could lead to as many as five days of power outages. As Szatowski said: ""Some would call that catastrophic."" Governors act . Such conditions are expected to cause a nightmare commute Wednesday morning in and around the New York metro area, among other places. But the nightmare may come sooner elsewhere. In Arkansas, the prospect of freezing rain spurred Gov. Mike Beebe to tell nonessential state employees to stay home Tuesday. CNN affiliate KATV reported that tens of thousands of people in the state would be without power through at least Wednesday morning. Most of those customers were with Entergy Arkansas, which reported 40,000 outages. Temperatures were going to reach a low of 28 degrees in Little Rock, the station reported. Arkansas is on the western edge of freezing rain forecast through Tuesday night -- a line that stretches east-northeastward into Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and points east. Generally, places north of that line will get snow and those south will get rain. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie each issued a state of emergency. Christie advised residents to drive carefully or stay home. Kansas City, Missouri, officials told business to stagger start times on Wednesday to make morning traffic easier, something the city has never done before, said a spokesman for the city's public works department. In Texas, Gov. Rick Perry renewed a waiver that makes it easier for trucks to transport propane through his state to others that have declared a propane emergency. Frozen night ahead . In Three Rivers, Michigan, CNN iReporter Diana Etman took pictures of mountains of snow in a Walmart parking lot. ""I was very much surprised at how big they were,"" the 56-year-old registered nurse said. But it's what happens after whatever falls to the ground -- especially once temperatures dip below freezing in some areas after nightfall -- that has some especially concerned. And authorities are also telling people to be careful in places where only snow has fallen. The weather service, for instance, said that whatever snow may have melted from the storm that dumped a record 8 inches on New York's Central Park may have refrozen overnight. Ice could become even more of a problem after fresh snow begins early Wednesday in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. ""Then the warm air comes in, and it rains -- and it's going to be 32,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""It's going to be a mess."" Up to a foot of snow . Not that snow itself won't make things plenty messy in some places. Residents of Kansas City, Missouri, could see up to a foot of snow by Tuesday's end. And more than a foot of snow is predicted through Wednesday for much of Upper New York state, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The weather will mean headaches not just for those hoping to hit the road, but also those trying to fly. More than 1,600 flights were canceled by late Tuesday evening, and more than 3,900 were delayed within, into or out of the United States, according to FlightAware.com. And the backlog will only grow Wednesday as more than 1,700 flights have already been called off for the day. The most affected airport Tuesday -- with more than 180 canceled departures -- was O'Hare International in Chicago, which just finished its third-snowiest January ever. This is due to the second wintry blast this year for the Northeast. Last month, extreme cold, strong winds and snow pummeled communities from New York to Maine. The third one may be the worst, forecasters said. Myers, the CNN meteorologist, said that a massive nor'easter could bear down early next week. ""This is the starter,"" he said of the current blast of snow, ""the appetizer to what's coming -- which is a major nor'easter coming on Monday."" CNN's Tom Watkins, Ed Payne, Chandrika Narayan, Catherine E. Shoichet and Haimy Assefa contributed to this report.","NEW: One town in Kansas gets 13 inches of snow, CNN affiliate says .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The Lowndes County, Georgia, Sheriff's Office does not believe an anonymous e-mail claiming that a former schoolmate confessed to killing Kendrick Johnson is credible, an attorney for the department told CNN on Thursday. The attorney did not tell CNN why or how investigators determined the tip was not credible. The determination was made after a Lowndes County assistant district attorney issued a grand jury subpoena to obtain identifying information about the sender of the e-mail. CNN obtained the e-mail and the subpoena Monday, in response to a state Open Records Act request submitted to the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office. The anonymous e-mail tip is dated January 27, 2014. The sender of the e-mail does not suggest he or she witnessed a confession; instead, the sender claims to have been told information by somebody who purportedly was aware of a confession in the 2013 death by one of the people implicated in the e-mail. Johnson's body was found in a rolled-up mat in the Lowndes High School gymnasium on January 11, 2013. Investigators with the Sheriff's Office ruled his death accidental, concluding that he climbed into the center of the gym mat to reach for a shoe and got stuck. According to an incident report provided to CNN by the Sheriff's Office, investigators interviewed two of four students identified by name in the anonymous e-mail on January 28. Both students acknowledged they knew Johnson but denied any involvement in his death. The incident report does not indicate whether the investigators attempted to speak with the two other students identified in the e-mail. CNN is not naming the students mentioned in the e-mail because none of them has been named a suspect in the death of Johnson. Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson, 17, got stuck while reaching for a shoe at the center of the mat and that his death was accidental. The state's medical examiner agreed, citing ""positional asphyxia"" as the cause of death. Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson believe their son was beaten to death and officials are ""covering up a murder."" An independent pathologist, hired by the parents, concluded that the death was the result of a homicide after finding evidence of ""unexplained apparent non-accidental blunt force trauma"" to Johnson's neck. ""If anybody has any information of a different opinion that they can provide to us, we're certainly open to looking at that. We're not closed-minded on this,"" Lt. Stryde Jones, supervisor of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office's Investigative Division, told CNN in May. The Sheriff's Office has received many public comments regarding Johnson's death since it closed its case on May 2. The grand jury subpoena is the first document provided to CNN that suggests the department has acted on any of those public comments. ""Although our case has been closed, if evidence comes forward, specifically testimony, then we're open to hearing that and certainly we'll act accordingly,"" Jones said. Chief Assistant District Attorney Bradfield Shealy issued the subpoena to Mediacom Communications Corp. on January 28. The New York-based cable, phone and Internet provider was ordered to provide the Lowndes County grand jury with subscriber information associated with the e-mail sent through the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office's website, or submit the documents to the district attorney's office or Jones before February 26. According to a Lowndes County Sheriff's Office incident report, the subpoena was faxed to Mediacom on February 7. Mediacom received the subpoena via fax Wednesday afternoon and immediately complied with Georgia officials' request, spokesman Tom Larson told CNN on Thursday. Last week, students from Lowndes High School and nearby Valdosta High School were among those who appeared before a federal grand jury in Macon, as part of the Department of Justice's investigation into Johnson's death. The U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore, launched the federal investigation on October 31.","The Lowndes County, Georgia, Sheriff's Office says it does not believe an anonymous e-mail .

"Washington (CNN) -- Will it be a boycott or a chaperone? House Democrats remained undecided Friday on whether they would join a select committee created by majority Republicans to investigate the Benghazi terror attack. The chamber's Democratic leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, described a split in her caucus over the matter in remarks to reporters that lambasted Republicans for what she called a ""political stunt,"" ""subterfuge"" and a ""diversionary tactic."" Options under consideration include participating as a minority bloc, which Republicans have proposed; having a lone member take part to register disapproval but maintain a presence, or rejecting the entire process as a partisan witch hunt. ""The question is what are the terms under which Democrats can participate,"" Pelosi said, citing the need for her side to concur with any committee decision to issue subpoenas. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said it was Democrats who have to decide what to do. ""The ball is in their court,"" said the aide, Michael Steel. However, a letter from Pelosi to Boehner later Friday rejected the GOP stance as ""fundamentally unfair"" and said it would politicize the process. Boehner, meanwhile, used a glitzy Twitter post akin to a concert or pro-wrestling poster to announce the seven Republicans to serve on the new panel chaired by GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, a former prosecutor. Joining Gowdy on the panel were Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Susan Brooks of Indiana, Mike Pompeo of Kansas, Martha Roby of Alabama, Peter Roskam of Illinois and Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia. Political posturing . Boehner created the select panel to streamline other committee investigations of the September 2012 armed assault on the U.S. diplomatic compound in eastern Libya killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Benghazi -- government cover-up or right-wing conspiracy theory? Republicans have complained since the attack, which came less than two months before President Barack Obama's re-election, that the administration failed to properly secure the compound, neglected to send military assets to try to save the besieged Americans and then tried to cover up exactly what happened. The White House and Democrats counter that multiple investigations have found security deficiencies, but not the kind of wrongdoing alleged by Republicans. Pelosi took aim at a chief GOP inquisitor, House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa of California, saying Friday that he botched his panel's probe and Boehner now needed to distance him from the matter. ""Issa just is damaged goods,"" she said. ""They had to move from him to another venue with another chairman. That's what this is. We have been there and done this over and over again."" In her letter to Boehner, Pelosi said the Republican plan for the select committee's membership and process would permit what she called the ""unacceptable and repeated abuses"" of Issa's management of oversight committee investigations. Democrats complain of leaked information, denied witness requests and other actions by Issa they consider improper and blatantly political. ""We find it fundamentally unfair,"" Pelosi wrote, adding that ""this process must not be politicized."" Boehner's choices to fill out the Republican membership of the select committee include Jordan, one of Issa's top attack dogs on the oversight panel. GOP targets Hillary Clinton . For Republicans, the issue presents an opportunity to attack then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 if she decides to run. Clinton is polling well so far against all likely GOP challengers, and the emotional Benghazi issue offers Republicans a chance to exploit one of her few potential vulnerabilities. A nearly party line vote of 232-186 on Thursday established the panel despite investigations by multiple House committees that have reviewed documents, interviewed witnesses and held numerous hearings. Seven Democrats backed the formation of the committee. Most face tough re-election bids in ""red"" districts. GOP plans call for the seven Republicans named by Boehner to be joined by five Democrats on the committee, which would have subpoena powers. Democrats argued Friday that the special panel was a political ploy to keep the controversy in play during a midterm election year. ""We are trying to find a way to make this work but the Republicans have shown no inclination to make it work,"" Rep. Steve Israel of New York told reporters. ""If this is going to be a true bipartisan inquiry, we will participate. If it is engineered to be a Republican campaign strategy, it is much harder for us to participate."" Keeping up the pressure . Boehner has kept up the pressure on Benghazi, saying Thursday that new questions about the Obama administration's handling of the matter now required the House ""to respond as one institution"" to arrive at the truth. Hillary Clinton: No reason for new Benghazi committee . He said the committee would have robust authority and its investigation ""will not be a partisan process."" In moving ahead with the committee, Boehner said that ""a line was crossed in two places."" First, he said documents unearthed by a conservative watchdog that surfaced last week raised questions about the administration's explanation of events after the attack. He also said the administration defied a congressional subpoena to turn over information. There has been intense controversy over early statements linking the attack to a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States that had sparked demonstrations elsewhere at the time. But it was soon revealed that Benghazi was a coordinated terror attack . Republicans allege the administration politicized its response in a presidential election year. The White House has said the new information cited by Boehner was broad-based and not specifically related to Benghazi. Borger: The biggest mistake Democrats could make on Benghazi . House Republicans are unlikely to bend to Democratic demands on the details of the committee, a GOP source familiar with the matter told CNN. But when pressed about whether Republicans would make changes to give Democrats more power in the investigation, Boehner would only say that ""there are further conversations continuing on that issue."" Those talks were said to be intense. One aide told CNN that Democrats recognized they were unlikely to get changes they outlined in a letter to Boehner. But the aide said that ""the calculus on this is being weighed -- do we participate in a Darrell Issa-like committee or worse, or is it worth having someone in the room for it?""

"(CNN) -- Florida highway patrol troopers plan to talk to pro golfer Tiger Woods on Saturday to get more information about his car crash near his home, a spokeswoman said. Woods was treated and released from a hospital after suffering minor injuries in a car accident early Friday in his central Florida neighborhood. State troopers had tried to speak to Woods on Friday as part of a routine car accident investigation, but his wife said he was sleeping, said Kim Miller, a spokeswoman for the Florida highway patrol. Troopers decided they would return Saturday afternoon, Miller said. Cellphone pictures of the accident from CNN affiliate WFTV . A joint statement from Woods' publicist and Health Central Hospital said the golfer was in ""good condition"" after the accident outside his home. Tiger Woods: A true sporting legend . The single-vehicle accident occurred about 2:25 a.m. in Windermere, a suburb of Orlando, according to police. Woods pulled out of his driveway in a 2009 Cadillac SUV and struck a fire hydrant, then a tree, according to an incident report from the Florida highway patrol in Orange County. Police Chief Daniel Saylor said two Windermere police officers were the first to arrive on the scene. ""There was Tiger Woods laying on the ground in front of the vehicle with his wife over him rendering first aid,"" he told reporters. ""He was in and out of consciousness with lacerations to his upper and lower lip,"" Saylor said. ""He was mumbling but didn't say anything coherent."" Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren, told the police she was inside the house when she heard the accident. She said she went outside and used a golf club to break out the rear window of the vehicle, then pulled him from the SUV. ""According to the officers, yes, she was very upset,"" he said in response to a question. But, he added, ""Things like this happen all the time ... I understand he's stable and he's fine."" About 10 minutes later, Orange County fire and rescue arrived and took him to Health Central Hospital, where he was treated and released, he said. The crash remains under investigation and charges were pending, the police report said. It also noted the accident was not alcohol-related. The SUV, which was drivable, was towed and state troopers didn't take pictures of the scene, she said. Saylor said the vehicle's front end was damaged. The 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times, and three U.S. Open Championships. He was set to host and play the Chevron World Challenge on Monday at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California. Woods has won the tournament -- which helps raise money for Tiger Woods Foundation programs -- four times. Woods has won six times on the PGA tour this year after returning from knee surgery. In a post on his blog last month, Woods said he was ""absolutely thrilled"" about his PGA tour, adding, ""This has been one of my most consistent years on the PGA tour."" Woods and his wife have two children, ages 2 and a baby born in February. CNN's Kim Segal contributed to this report .","Police found Tiger Woods on ground in front of car with cuts on lips .

"Editor's note: upwave is Turner Broadcasting's new lifestyle brand designed to entertain the health into you! Visit upwave.com for more information and follow upwave on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram @upwave. (upwave.com) -- Every year, we like to celebrate St. Patrick's Day by indulging in some quintessentially Irish things, such as stout beer, strong whiskey and/or corned beef and cabbage. Cabbage aside, those aren't exactly the cornerstones of a healthy lifestyle -- but the good people of Ireland do know a few things about staying fit. According to data collected by the Irish Sports Monitor in 2013, 47% of Irish men and women aged 16 and over participate in some form of regular exercise. While some choose common activities (gym-based workouts, swimming, running, cycling), others enjoy singularly Irish ones like dancing (think: Riverdance) and the sport of hurling. Want to celebrate St. Paddy's Day (or any day) in a healthy way? Here are a few Irish-themed workouts that'll help you earn a Guinness or two. upwave: 7 awesome things beer does for your body . Good: Exercise like a lumberjack . During the Irish potato famine of the 1840s, many citizens of the Emerald Isle immigrated to the United States and Canada and found employment as lumberjacks and loggers in the booming timber industry. Today, there is an exercise known as the ""Irish Lumberjack,"" which builds the arm and core strength needed to chop down trees. Sure, you probably won't have to hew gargantuan trees anytime soon, but great arms, abs and balance always come in handy. Here's how the exercise works: Execute a few sets of one-armed dumbbell rows while balancing on one leg with the knee slightly bent. Be aware of your posture and try to keep your back from rounding. Your non-weight-bearing leg should be fully extended behind you with your torso parallel to the floor, so your body makes a ""T"" shape. Repeat until you feel like an Irish lumberjack. upwave: Quick 5-minute upper body workout . Better: Give hurling a whirl . Believed to be the world's oldest field game, the Gaelic sport of hurling is a mixture of soccer, hockey and lacrosse, with two teams of 15 players squaring off to put a small ball into the opposing team's net. Since you need 30 people for a full game, it can be hard to get one going on a whim (unless you join a club team). Luckily, though (and the Irish are full of luck), reaping the physical benefits of the sport can be accomplished without heading to the field. Personal trainer Paul O'Brien recommends mixing aerobic and anaerobic conditioning to train like a hurler athlete. Some days, run two to three miles at a steady pace to build up endurance. Other days, do a series of 50-meter sprints to hone in on your explosiveness. That way, if you do ever make it onto the hurling field for a game, you'll have the speed and the strength to play hard until the final whistle blows. upwave: Increase your stamina in 5 days . Best: Leap like you're Lord of the Dance . Dancing has always been an integral part of Irish life, comprising everything from traditional Irish folk dances to the vigorous step dances and jigs popularized in modern times by ""Lord of the Dance"" creator Michael Flatley. It's also excellent exercise -- especially step dancing, which requires the dancer to execute intricate and rapid movements with the feet (making it a powerful workout for both the legs and the lungs). Another perk of Irish dancing is core development, since the body and arms are mostly kept still as the dancer performs the elaborate footwork. upwave: Quick 6-minute core workout . The benefits of getting footloose also extend beyond the physical. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that dancing keeps your brain nimble and can help to ward off dementia as you age. And because you're listening to music while you dance, it feels like less work than comparable exercises. ""Music reduces your perception of exertion by about 10%,"" says Costas Karageorghis, a sports psychologist at London's Brunel University. To get started, see this basic Irish dance routine created by the lovely people from Riverdance. upwave: Try it now! Take the Irish workout challenge .

"(CNN) -- The Northwestern football union case is going to Capitol Hill next week. Minnesota Republican John Kline, chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said in a news release that the committee will hold hearings Thursday on the National Labor Relations Board's recent decision to categorize football players at Northwestern University as employees who can unionize and seek benefits. Kline questioned the decision. ""The NLRB's decision represents a radical departure from longstanding federal labor policies,"" Kline said. ""Classifying student athletes as employees threatens to fundamentally alter college sports, as well as reduce education access and opportunity. The committee has a responsibility to thoroughly examine how the NLRB's decision will affect students and their ability to receive a quality education."" Kline isn't alone in his skepticism. The ruling has been divisive within the world of college sport and in politics. Several state-level politicians have proposed legislation because of the ruling. The communications director for the committee, Alexandra Haynes Sollberger, told CNN that a witness list for the hearing has not yet been released. Team holds union vote, but result is cliffhanger . When contacted Friday afternoon, Ramogi Huma, a leading force behind the union and the president of the National College Players Association, said he had just learned of the hearing and didn't have any details. In February, the National Labor Relations Board in Chicago ruled that Northwestern's football players are considered employees of the university, since they make money for their university and are compensated with tuition. The judge ruled they often have to devote more than 40 hours a week to sport and sometimes sacrifice classwork. Northwestern is appealing the ruling, and because of that, the athletes votes that were cast last month were not counted and won't be counted until after the appeal is decided. Head coach Pat Fitzgerald advised his team to vote against it before the ballots were cast, and some of the Northwestern players then publicly said they are against the idea. Either way, Huma said the NLRB ruling was an unprecedented shift in the way college revenue sport athletes are viewed and will have a domino effect across the country. Northwestern University is in Chicago.","The House Education and Workforce Committee will hold hearings on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Kodak -- the company known for decades for its cameras and film -- this week confirmed it used weapons-grade uranium in an underground lab in upstate New York for upwards of 30 years. A company spokesman and a former scientist for the firm say there was not enough material to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. Former Kodak researcher Albert Filo said the uranium was alloyed with aluminum in plates sealed in sleeves that were not moved for three decades. The amount of fuel was about 3Â½ pounds, which experts say is less than one-tenth of the amount necessary to make a crude nuclear device. The alloyed material ""could not be readily converted to make a nuclear weapon,"" said Eastman Kodak spokesman Christopher Veronda. ""Disassembling the device and removing these plates was a process that took highly trained experts more than a day to perform."" But advocates for preventing nuclear proliferation say it highlights the risk that terrorists could obtain enough fuel to build a nuclear device. ""In this day and age, no one should be allowed to possess nuclear-weapons-usable material without providing an armed defense of that material,"" said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""There really should be an effort to eliminate the use of materials in commercial companies that could be used by terrorists to make nuclear weapons,"" he said. Kodak turned the material over to the government in 2007, under heavy security. But for more than 30 years, the company had a device called a californium neutron flux multiplier, or CFX, in a specially built labyrinth beneath Building 82 at its labs near Rochester, New York. The device was about the size of a refrigerator. It was not a reactor, but rather a hunk of metal emitting radiation. Its purpose was to create a beam of neutrons to use for scanning and testing other materials. The device's primary source of neutron radiation was the radioactive element californium, but the stream of neutrons produced by the californium was multiplied by passing it through a lattice of highly enriched uranium U-235, whose nuclear fission released additional neutrons. According to a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Kodak's uranium was highly enriched -- to a level approaching 93.4%. That is the type of weapons-grade material that U.S. government agencies are trying to prevent terrorists from getting their hands on. (For the sake of comparison, Iran claims to have enriched uranium to 20%, leading Western nations to impose sanctions on the country in an effort to prevent Iran from pursuing further enrichment.) Lyman acknowledges that the quantity was not enough to make a bomb. ""But you can always imagine,"" he said, ""an adversary that was coordinated could steal enough in different areas to kind of consolidate, and have enough for a bomb."" While Kodak did not have armed guards, Filo said that there were security procedures in place to prevent any unauthorized access to the uranium. Also, he said, it would take hours or days for anyone to dismantle the CFX and extract the nuclear fuel. He also said the bunker was subject to regular inspection, never leaked radiation, and never posed any risk to the neighborhood of radioactive exposure. ""The walls surrounding it were two feet of reinforced concrete. The ceiling over it was again two feet of concrete and then eight feet of earth. So it was really a well-shielded instrument,"" he said. Kodak says it never intended to hide the CFX, and it was licensed by both state and federal officials. But the fact that the company was handling highly enriched uranium was never widely publicized. There are 31 reactors in the United States for research or testing purposes, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Most are run by universities and use low-enriched uranium rather than highly enriched uranium. But weapons-grade fuel is still used in some reactors, said Lyman. ""The (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) reactor, and a (university) reactor in Missouri, both still use highly enriched uranium. The Department of Energy would like those reactors to change the way they operate, so they don't have to use bomb material anymore,"" he said. ""But it's technically hard, it costs a lot of money, and there's resistance."" CNN's Chris Kokenes contributed to this report.","Kodak turned the material over to the government in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- A Mexican national who pleaded guilty to trying to buy a Stinger missile and other military weapons for a Mexican drug cartel has been sentenced to 25 years in prison, federal prosecutors said. David Diaz-Sosa, 27, of Sinaloa, Mexico, pleaded guilty in April 2011 to four charges, U.S. Attorney for Arizona John S. Leonardo said in a statement released in Phoenix. U.S. District Judge James A. Teilborg also Wednesday sentenced Diaz-Sosa to five years of supervised release after serving the federal prison sentence, officials said. The Tucson office for defense attorney Marivel Cantu-Madril said she was not available for comment Thursday. Previously on CNN.com: 3 accused of trying to buy military weapons for Mexican drug cartel . Three people were charged last year, according to an indictment unsealed in Phoenix. The government said the plot was foiled because the people the alleged conspirators were dealing with were federal undercover agents and a government informant. ""With the confiscation of a significant quantity of methamphetamine and U.S. currency, this operation not only delivered a financial blow to a Mexican drug trafficking organization, but it also prevented further cartel violence by keeping dangerous weapons out of their hands,"" Leonardo said in a statement. Court documents say the alleged conspirators' shopping list included: a Stinger surface-to-air-missile; a Dragon fire anti-tank weapon; a Law Rocket anti-tank weapon; and two AT-4 recoilless anti-tank guns. The indictment said the defendants were to pay with cash and illegal drugs. According to the indictment, the conspiracy began in November 2009 with Diaz-Sosa allegedly acting as the ""primary broker"" in trying to buy weapons for the Sinaloa drug cartel. The court filings said the suspects were shown weapons or fakes, but never bought actual arms. Diaz-Sosa arranged for the delivery of 4.5 pounds of methamphetamine for a down payment, prosecutors said Wednesday. He and another associate were arrested in February 2010 when they exchanged 11 pounds of methamphetamine as a final payment. Diaz-Sosa pleaded guilty to conspiracy to acquire and export an anti-aircraft missile; conspiracy to possess unregistered firearms and transfer firearms for use in a drug trafficking crime; conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine; and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. In a court filing, lawyers for Diaz-Sosa said he expressed remorse and regretted putting his family through ""this embarrassment.""","Group tried to buy high-powered military weapons for Mexican cartel .

"(CNN) -- When celebrating the Cinco de Mayo holiday, consider a more authentic Mexican experience than simply ordering a margarita and chips and salsa at the local sports bar. Not ready for a trip to Mexico right now? There is plenty of Mexico to explore and celebrate in the United States since much of the Southwest was once part of our neighbor to the south. Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Battle of Puebla in which Mexican Gen. Ignacio Zaragoza led his outnumbered troops in defense of Puebla against the French on May 5, 1862. Zaragoza was born in 1829 just outside the Presidio La Bahia in Goliad (now part of Texas). The Presidio, or fort, displays a statue of Zaragoza, a Mexican national hero, who died of typhoid fever in 1862. Still operated by the Catholic Church, the Presidio hosts Mass every Sunday at the Our Lady of Loreto Chapel. (Cinco de Mayo is not Mexican Independence Day, which is September 16, 1810.) Mexico tourism holds its own . Remember the Alamo (and more)! Many people will mark the weekend holiday with a visit to the MisiÃ³n San Antonio de Valero in San Antonio, now known as the Alamo, which the Spanish first constructed and Mexican and Texas troops later occupied. The March 6, 1836, battle between Mexican troops and Texas revolutionaries is known among descendants of the Republic of Texas as a great fight against impossible odds. The Mexican troops crushed the revolutionaries, but the Texans fought back victoriously later that year, and the Republic of Texas was born. For a celebratory atmosphere, visit Market Square, where you can visit the shops of El Mercado to find pinatas, jewelry, clothing, leather and other goods similar to stores in Mexico. The square also hosts ""Primer Sabados"" or ""First Saturdays"" with food booths, art, music and children's programs. A couple of local dining favorites are the chilaquiles breakfast taco on flour tortilla at Blanco Cafe downtown and Henry's Puffy Tacos. Eatocracy: All the fixings for a festive fiesta . San Diego: First Spanish settlement on West Coast . The birthplace of San Diego is preserved at Old Town San Diego State Historic Park, the site of the first Spanish settlement on the U.S. West Coast and San Diego's first downtown. Mexico took over the downtown after the country won its independence from Spain in 1821. The six-block site contains preserved and restored adobe and wooden buildings, thriving restaurants and shops. Old Town will host Fiesta Cinco de Mayo on Friday through Sunday. The Barrio Logan neighborhood initially welcomed people fleeing the Mexican Revolution in the early 20th century, and the area is now home to the local Mexican-American community, Mexican street art and modern art galleries. Some early evidence of the artistic scene can be found at Chicano Park beneath the San Diego-Coronado Bridge overpass. The Centro Cultural de la Raza is in Balboa Park, where children can also enjoy the San Diego Zoo and the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center. The center is a cultural arts center dedicated to Mexican, Mexican American, indigenous and other Latino art and culture. Pueblo, Colorado: Flowing out of Sangre de Cristo mountain range . Established by Colorado's mix of early pioneers as Fort Pueblo, a smaller version of the current city of Pueblo was incorporated as part of the Colorado Territory in 1870. Colorado became a U.S. state in 1876. With the arrival of the railroad and an abundance of coal, Pueblo became a thriving steel town. Each September, thousands of people come to Pueblo for the Chile & Frijoles Festival to celebrate the harvest of the town's most important crops: the mirasol green chile and pinto beans. The festivities have included chili and salsa competitions, a jalapeno pepper eating contest, a 5K fun run, art exhibitions and live entertainment. To learn more about the region's history, check out the renovated El Pueblo History Museum in the Union Avenue Historic District. For arts and culture, look to the Sangre de Cristo Arts & Conference Center and the Buell Children's Museum. And the annual Colorado State Fair hosts nearly two weeks of livestock shows, rodeos and music starting in late August. Spanish land grants in Arizona . Established in 1752 as a Spanish presidio, the town of Tubac (now in Arizona) was once a stop on the road from Mexico to the Spanish settlements in California. Tubac Presidio State Historic Park preserves the site of the Presidio San Ignacio de Tubac, the oldest fort in what would become the state of Arizona. Now it's an artist colony and home to many galleries. When you're finished gallery hopping, head to Elvira's restaurant, which was established in 1927 in Nogales, Mexico, and reopened in Tubac. About 50 miles from Tubac, Rancho De La Osa was part of the original 3 million-acre land grant from Spain's king to the Ortiz brothers of Mexico in 1812. The rancho fell within the boundaries of the United States after the 1854 signing of the Gadsden Purchase settling the U.S.-Mexican border. It now welcomes overnight guests, who can view a cannonball on display that Pancho Villa reportedly fired at the house during the Mexican Revolution. The nearby Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge is open 24 hours a day and welcomes horseback riding, hunting, bird watching and bird migration counts. (Look for the spring migration count on or around the second Saturday in May.)","Cinco de Mayo commemorates the 1862 Battle of Puebla .

"(CNN) -- Syria has been killing civilians and international powers have failed to intervene. The United States has killed people with drones and listened in on private communications in the name of national security. Russia has passed laws that target gays and lesbians. These are some of the trends in 2013 that Human Rights Watch (HRW) cited in its annual account of human rights records around the world on Tuesday. In a 667-page report, the New York-based group highlighted key human rights issues in more than 90 countries, drawing on events through November. HRW executive director Kenneth Roth presented the account, the 24th of its kind, at a press conference in Berlin. Below are some of the issues in focus. Syria . Human Rights Watch deplored international powers for failing in their responsibility to protect civilians in Syria after almost three years of civil war that has claimed more than 100,000 lives. A day before international negotiations begin in Switzerland, the group contrasted the handling of the conflict with the reaction of the international community in other countries such as Central African Republic and South Sudan. It said ""the unchecked slaughter of civilians in Syria elicited global horror and outrage but not enough to convince world leaders to exert the pressure needed to stop it."" It accused Russia and China of using their vetoes at the United Nations Security Council to shield the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from strong international action, such as an arms embargo or referral to the International Criminal Court. ""Despite a swiftly rising death toll and horrific abuses, Russia and China neutered the UN Security Council and enabled the killing of Syrian civilians by both sides,"" Roth said in a statement. ""As the Geneva II peace talks begin, with uncertain prospects of success, they shouldn't become the latest excuse to avoid action to protect Syrian civilians. This requires real pressure to stop the killing and allow the delivery of the humanitarian aid they need to survive."" A team of internationally renowned war crimes prosecutors and forensic experts has found ""direct evidence"" of ""systematic torture and killing"" by al-Assad's regime, the lawyers on the team have said in a new report. Egypt . The HRW report also highlighted alleged abuses in struggling democracies, calling Egypt the ""most glaring"" example of ""abusive majoritarianism."" The report criticized the government of the country's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsy, which it said ruled ""in a manner that left secular and minority groups fearing exclusion in an Islamist-dominated government"". In the wake of Morsy's military-backed ouster in July, the interim government of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi had launched what HRW said was the ""worst repression that Egypt has known in decades, including by killing hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood protesters."" ""For the second time since the fall of (former leader Hosni) Mubarak in February 2011, a government is in power with little apparent inclination to limit itself by respecting basic rights,"" HRW said. Authorities have cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood since Morsy's ouster, rounding up the movement's leaders and making membership illegal. Egypt passes a new constitution . United States . President Barack Obama's record on national security issues came under fire from HRW -- from the continued existence of the detention center in Guantanamo Bay to what the group called the unlawful killing of civilians through drone attacks in countries such as Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. Another major topic concerned the revelations of ""virtually unchecked mass electronic surveillance"" by the United States made public by fugitive and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. While HRW credited Obama for appointing a panel to recommend reforms, it questioned ""whether any of these recommendations will be acted on."" In a speech on Friday, Obama unveiled new guidance for gathering intelligence as well as reforms intended to balance what he called the nation's vital security needs with concerns over privacy and civil liberties. HRW expressed concern other governments, including those will a poor rights record, could follow the American example in surveillance, forcing ""user data to stay within their own borders, setting up the potential for increased Internet censorship."" In addition, the group chided Washington for attempting to prosecute Snowden under the Espionage Act, noting that this had allowed Russia, which has offered Snowden temporary sanctuary, to ""recast itself as a champion of privacy rights."" What Obama changed at the NSA . Russia . HRW highlighted ""homophobic rhetoric, including by officials, and rising homophobic violence"" in Russia, which last year passed a law that bans even discussion of homosexuality anywhere that children might hear it. The legislation, which President Vladimir Putin signed in June, gives authorities the power to impose fines as well as detain and deport foreigners who are deemed to have breached the law. Putin says gays 'can feel safe' at the games . ""Vigilante groups, consisting of radical nationalists, and Neo-Nazis, lure men or boys to meetings, accuse them of being gay, humiliate and beat them, and post videos of the proceedings on social media,"" HRW said in the report. ""A few investigations were launched, but have not yet resulted in effective prosecution."" Authorities in Russia, which will host the Winter Olympics in Sochi next month, have also continued the crackdown on civil society and government critics that began in 2012, it said. Enforcement of the ""foreign agents"" law in 2013 led to an unprecedented, nationwide inspection campaign of hundreds of nongovernmental organizations and court cases, it said. HRW dismissed Putin's decision late last year to free jailed activists from the punk band Pussy Riot and environmental group Greenpeace, as well as Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky as attempts to avoid international criticism ahead of the Winter Olympics. ""The effect was largely to highlight the arbitrariness"" of Mr. Putin's government, the report said. China . While it announced the abolition of ""the abusive administrative detention system Re-education Through Labor, relaxation of the one-child policy, and plans to improve the delivery of justice, (China's new leadership) has yet to embark on fundamental reforms that adequately respond to the public's increased demands for justice and accountability,"" HRW said. The group said it was particularly concerned about the arrests of activists who have campaigned for officials to publicly disclose their assets despite the government's declared crackdown on graft. Other areas of concern include a government campaign to stifle online rumors, and repressive policies in the restive ethnic minority regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, it said. HRW said international pressure on China over its human rights situation was ""inconsistent"" last year, saying that some countries, such as France and Britain, had toned down criticism in summits with the Chinese leadership. ""China is home to more than a billion people and is a major global power, so how the rest of the world addresses its human rights situation is more vital than ever,"" HRW Asia director Brad Adams said in a statement. China has consistently defended its human rights record and lambasted foreign groups which criticize it.","Human Rights Watch releases annual report looking at more than 90 countries .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russian investigators have no suspects in Monday's killings of a prominent human rights lawyer and a journalist despite round-the-clock efforts to find the gunman, officials said Wednesday. A woman places flowers at the spot where Stanislav Markelov and Anastasiya Baburova were gunned down. Surveillance cameras recorded the murders but investigators could not make out the killer's identity, Moscow Police Chief Vladimir Pronin told reporters, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported. ""I can only state that it is a young man 180 centimeters (5 feet, 11 inches) high with a slim body build,"" Pronin said. ""I can also state that there are no witnesses who saw the killer."" He added police could not determine the killer's ethnicity because a cap was over his eyes. The gunman killed attorney Stanislav Markelov, 34, in front of an office in central Moscow, Russian media reported. Journalist Anastasia Baburova, 25, who worked for the pro-democracy newspaper Novaya Gazeta, was also shot when she tried to intervene, and she died later in a hospital, Russian reports said. The killer stood behind them and aimed at the back of the head, Novaya Gazeta reported Wednesday. An estimated 3,000 people rallied in the Chechen capital of Grozny on Tuesday to protest the killings, Interfax reported. Reurters.com reported Tuesday hundreds of mourners demanded justice for the pair. ""I am deeply sorry and disgusted for Russia: how can you just shoot people down in broad daylight in the center of Moscow,"" said artist Alexandra Fomina, according to Reuters. ""Can we tolerate this much longer? And will they catch anyone for this murder -- or will it be business as usual?"" The funerals are scheduled for Friday. Markelov was known for his work on high-profile cases. He represented the family of a Chechen woman killed by a former Russian colonel in March 2000, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. Rebels seeking independence in Chechnya, an autonomous Russian republic, have long been fighting Russia. Markelov had held a news conference hours before his death opposing the early release of the colonel, Yury Budanov, who was freed after serving eight years of a 10-year sentence. Novaya Gazeta Editor-in-Chief Dmitry Muratov suggested Baburova was killed when she tried to apprehend the lawyer's killer, but he also could not rule out the possibility that she herself was a target, Interfax reported. ""In fact, these two theories might well have something in common,"" Muratov told the news agency. Budanov has denied any involvement in the killings. ""Do you think I want to get another prison term after spending several days in freedom?"" Budanov said in an interview with the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. He told the interviewer the crime was ""masterminded by those who want to drive a wedge between Russians and Chechens.""","NEW: Chechens protest killings of lawyer and journalist in Moscow .

"Juneau, Alaska (CNN) -- Quick: Name the governor of Alaska. Nope, not Sarah Palin. He's no reality TV star. Isn't on anyone's list of 2016 presidential candidates. And the local press thinks he's so bland they call him the ""Oatmeal Governor."" But Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell deserves national name-recognition for one reason: He's taking on one of the most important issues of our time. He's trying to get Alaska to talk about the ""resident evil"" of rape. ""It's culturally permissible to be silent about it,"" and that must change, Parnell told me in a recent interview at the governor's office in Juneau. (You commissioned that trip, by the way, as part of CNN's Change the List project. More on that here.) For years, this state -- which has the highest reported rate of rape in the country, according to 2012 FBI crime estimates -- denied it had a problem. Politicos and advocates said maybe Alaskans reported rape more often than people in other states -- but, gosh, it couldn't be a bigger problem here than elsewhere, could it? Related: The rapist next door . Parnell has helped end that era of senseless denial. In our interview, he called violence against women an ""epidemic."" Like an alcoholic must admit he has a problem in order to face it, he told me, the governor of the state with the highest rape rate must, too, fess up to the problem in order to solve it. ""I can't wave a wand and solve alcoholism, I can't wave a wand and solve domestic violence, but I can work to create a climate where it's culturally permissible to speak about these things with our family and friends, get people to help who cross our paths, to stand up for those who are being abused and hurt,"" he said. ""To me that's a win in the end."" True enough. The cornerstone of Parnell's campaign is his ""Choose Respect"" initiative, which he announced in late 2009 after assuming the office from Palin. Now nearing the end of his first full term and seeking re-election in 2014, Parnell, a Republican, oversees a state that has increased spending on sexual violence treatment and prevention at a time when the overall state budget is shrinking. The ""Choose Respect"" program would receive $12.4 million in fiscal year 2015 if the governor's proposed budget were approved. That's only 0.1% of the total proposed budget, but it's still considerable. The laid-back 51-year-old governor, who looks like a kinder version of Sean Hannity plus Vladimir Putin, was born in California but moved to Anchorage at age 10, according to a biography on the Republican Governors Association website. His dad was in the Army and later served in the state legislature. Parnell, an attorney, once worked as a lobbyist for ConocoPhillips and other oil and gas interests. He served in the state legislature and then as lieutenant governor to Palin. Even liberals in the state, like Caren Robinson, who started the first women's shelter in Juneau, praise the fact that he has supported addressing domestic violence and rape since the 1990s as a member of the legislature. Parnell was elected to the Alaska House at age 29. I disagree with some of Parnell's policies -- he's not giving enough autonomy to Native Alaskan communities and courts, for instance, which may be well poised in some cases to handle cases of sexual and gender-based violence; his decision to block part of Obamacare is unwise; and, despite substantial efforts to change things, parts of the state is so remote they're almost totally lawless, which leads people to rape and abuse with a sense of near-impunity. The lawless 'end of the land' But the governor's efforts to get Alaska to talk about rape and violence against women are laudable in and of themselves. No policy will be able to fix this problem as long as silence and shame surround rape and abuse. Someone's got to speak up. I saw some results of the ""Choose Respect"" program firsthand: . â€¢ In Juneau, I met members of the Thunder Mountain High School basketball team, which participates in a program called Coaching Boys into Men. The team's coach, John Blasco, talks with his players regularly about healthy dating relationships and respect for women. A star shooting guard, Matt Seymour, 18, told me there have been instances when he's told teammates not to use demeaning language about women because of what he learned as part of the program. â€¢ In one small town in southwest Alaska, I met young people who are learning about the Yupik Eskimo culture in after-school programs at the Tundra Women's Coalition, which receives funding from the state. The idea is that traditional culture can strengthen society and, ultimately, reduce rates of sexual assault. I also met women who were flown into a shelter run by the coalition from outlying villages that are not connected to road systems. â€¢ Across Alaska, I saw the power of a statewide survey analyzed by the University of Alaska Anchorage Justice Center, and funded by the state. The survey effectively ended debate about whether Alaska has a problem with domestic violence and sexual assault, said Andre Rosay, director of the center. The 2010 survey of 871 adult women found 37% had suffered sexual violence and 59% had been the victim of sexual violence and/or intimate partner violence in their lifetimes. ""It was shocking and distressing for many people"" to see how common violence against women really was in Alaska, said Lauree Morton, executive director of the Alaska Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, a state-funded agency. That survey also has spurred change. 5 ways to help end rape in Alaska . Alaska shouldn't have needed those shocking numbers in order to act, but they do underscore the need for urgent action, and that information has won converts. Parnell told me he is convinced Alaska can change in part because his own grandfather was verbally and physically abusive to his family. But violence stopped with Parnell's father, who was never violent, he said. ""That gives me hope for the future of our country, when I see people taking that responsibility to live larger than what they've been taught,"" the governor said. Parnell is leaning on his people to spread the message that violence against women haunts Alaska and should not be tolerated. The state promotes a series of ""Choose Respect"" marches, which were organized in more than 140 communities across the state last year and will be held again in the spring. Those rallies help create a climate where ""more people come to safety and more people are willing to speak about the unspeakable,"" Parnell said. ""That's been the hardest part about the evil among us: We haven't been willing to talk about it,"" the governor added. ""The 'Choose Respect' initiative has given Alaskans permission to speak about these things."" Meet Alaska's pioneer woman . He added: ""I'm also sending a message as a man to women who have endured this shame that they are not to blame. They do not need to carry the guilt and shame -- and we are willing to embrace and love them unconditionally."" Parnell would like the ""Choose Respect"" campaign to spread across the country. He told me sports figures, in particular, have the power to raise awareness about ending sexual violence. ""This is going to be won in the hearts and minds of our young people,"" he said. ""To have a nation where every person lives free of fear ... and every person has that hope and opportunity for the future, that's my dream. But it's going to take everybody -- it's going to take 'real-deal' heroes standing up and speaking out and giving people permission to speak about this."" Those ""real-deal heroes"" should include people like Sarah Palin, the woman still more associated with the governorship in the American public's mind than Parnell. And -- forget celebrity -- they should include you, too. Hold a ""Choose Respect"" march in your community and let me know about it by tagging your photos #chooserespect on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.

"(CNN) -- On April 6, 2007, I woke up in the morning in a pool of blood. I had collapsed from exhaustion and hit my head on the corner of my desk, cutting my eye and breaking my cheekbone. In the weeks after, as I waited to get test results from various doctors on my health, I kept asking myself what kind of life was I living? What kind of success was I after? Even though I had founded Huffington Post two years before, I was still working 18 hours a day, seven days a week. By conventional definition of success, I was very successful. But by any sane definition, I was not living a successful life. I was on my way up in the ways that don't matter. And on my way down -- literally -- in many ways that do. My life, I realized, was out of control. I was not thriving. I realized that we need to redefine success so that it's not just about money and power. When I decided to write a book about our collective need to redefine success, I wanted it to be as practical as possible, filled with daily tips, tools and techniques that are easy to incorporate into our lives. This is no simple matter. Changing deeply ingrained habits is difficult. And when many of these habits are the product of deeply ingrained cultural norms, it is even harder. The challenge in redefining success has to do with slaying old habits and liberating ourselves from our complacency. We also have to find our individual thread. When we do that, no matter what life throws our way, we can use the thread to help us navigate the labyrinth of daily life and come back to our center. For me, the thread is something as simple as my breath. I have worked to integrate certain practices into my day -- meditation, walking, exercise -- but the connection that conscious breathing gives me is something I can return to in an instant during many times of the day. A conscious focus on breathing helps me introduce pauses into my daily life, brings me back into the moment, and helps me transcend upsets and setbacks. It has also helped me become much more aware of when I hold or constrict my breath, not just when dealing with a problem, but sometimes even when I'm doing something as mundane as putting a key in the door or reading an e-mail. When I use my breath to relax the contractions in my body, I can follow this thread back to my center. Humans lead complex lives, and one of the traits we've developed that has allowed us to be such productive creatures is the ability to make many learned traits and responses an automatic part of our lives, buried so deeply in the inner workings of our subconscious that they no longer require conscious thought. We might think we're in charge of our thoughts and behavior -- captains of our ship, turning the wheel this way and that -- but so often it's actually our autopilot that's in control. I'm reminded of the time when a friend took a family trip on a cruise ship. Her 10-year-old son kept pestering the crew, begging for a chance to drive the massive ocean liner. The captain finally invited the family up to the bridge, whereupon the boy grabbed hold of the wheel and began vigorously turning it. The boy's mother panicked until the captain leaned over and whispered to her not to worry because the ship was on autopilot; her son's maneuvers would have no effect. In the same way, if we're not able to reprogram our autopilot, all our protestations of wanting to change will be as pointless as the little boy furiously turning the wheel on the cruise ship. Reprogramming the autopilot takes different amounts of time for each of us. What makes it easier is focusing on ""keystone habits""; when you change one of them, it makes changing other habits easier. ""Keystone habits start a process that, over time, transforms everything,"" Charles Duhigg says in his book, ""The Power of Habit."" For me, the most powerful keystone habit has been sleep. Once I changed the amount of sleep I was getting, and started regularly getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night, other habits, such as meditation and exercise, became easier. One of the best ways to create positive keystone habits is to use our social support. Given that we're social creatures, it's much easier to create and reinforce new, positive habits in a social network, with a group of friends or colleagues who can band together for mutual encouragement. Even if the culture of your workplace still operates with the traditional definition of success, you can gather around you a group of like-minded people who want to not just succeed but thrive.

"(CNN) -- Rihanna postponed a concert in Malaysia that was set for Friday night, according to the show's promoter, following reports that she was allegedly assaulted by boyfriend Chris Brown. Rihanna was scheduled to play a concert in Malaysia on Friday. Promoter Pineapple Concerts announced Tuesday that it was notified by Rihanna's agent at the William Morris Agency that she would not make the Malaysia date. ""In light of recent events involving Rihanna, the artist management will confirm within two weeks from now on a replacement date to be mutually agreed by Pineapple Concerts and the artist,"" the company said. The promoter stressed that it was ""not a cancellation but a postponement"" and told those who bought tickets to hold on to them for a rescheduled date.  Watch the latest on the Brown-Rihanna incident » . The concert, to be held in at Stadium Putra Bukit Jalil on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, is part of Rihanna's ""Good Girl Gone Bad Tour,"" which began last year. Malaysia's conservative Islamic party protested against Rihanna last month, saying her show is too risque for the country. ""Rihanna's image including her dressing is not suitable for our culture,"" Kamaruzaman Mohamad of the Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) told Malaysia's Star newspaper. ""Even if she wore a headscarf here, we know it is not her real self because she performs differently in other places,"" he said. The government rejected the PAS demand that the show be canceled. Rihanna -- whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty -- canceled her performance at Sunday night's Grammy Awards as police were looking for Brown in connection with the alleged domestic violence incident. Brown, 19, turned himself in Sunday night. He was arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats. Brown was later released on a $50,000 bond. He is scheduled to appear in court on March 5. Police said Brown and a woman were in a vehicle near Hollywood's Hancock Park early Sunday when they became involved in an argument. The woman ""suffered visible injuries and identified Brown as her attacker,"" police said. While police did not identify Rihanna, 20, as the alleged victim, sources close to the couple told CNN she was the woman involved in the incident. Brown's lawyer has not responded to several requests for comment.","Rihanna was scheduled to play show in Malaysia Friday night .

"(CNN) -- With a twinkle in his eye and a gentle smile under the wide brim of a black cowboy hat, Clint Black is still out on the road charming country music fans of all ages. But beyond performing the hits like ""When I Said I Do"" and ""Like . the Rain,"" his music now has a mission. Black makes time out on the road these days for greeting very special fans -- families and children suffering from Rett syndrome. The rare disease is something Black and his family are all too familiar with. ""My niece Cortney, my brother Kevin's daughter, was afflicted with and lost her battle with it at age 16,"" Black said. Rett syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the way the brain develops. It is almost exclusively found in girls. According to Barry Rinehart from the International Rett Syndrome Foundation, Rett's is on the far end of the autism spectrum and is a mutation of the X chromosome, which is why it mostly affects girls. ""Essentially, something is happening in the human body where the brain and the nerve endings aren't making that connection. So that affects their breathing, that affects how they use their hands, that affects all kinds of communication things. You see all these girls who want to communicate and they probably are communicating but we aren't paying attention in the way we should be paying attention. But also they'll have seizures. They often won't be able to walk, so it manifests itself in different ways. So for some women and girls it can be very severe and lead to death. You know (it has a) 20% mortality rate but other times it can express itself very mildly,"" said Rinehart. Unfortunately for the Black family, Clint's niece fell into the 20th percentile. But he felt that this tragedy was a call to action. ""I never really knew what I could do, but once I saw my brother trying to help and doing some fundraising, I got involved and we started holding annual golf tournaments and concerts and I went on ""Apprentice"" and raised $20,000,"" Black said. While competing on ""The Apprentice,"" fellow contestant Scott Hamilton vowed to help Black raise more money. ""He acquired a grant from the Pioneer Fund for a million dollars -- a matching grant. So we raised our million and the Pioneer Fund matched it and then some,"" Black continued. Black now serves as the honorary chairperson for the Research to Reality campaign for the International Rett Syndrome Foundation. He's the face of the campaign, but the music star is rather humble about his influence. ""I don't want to pretend I'm doing a great deal, you know I try to bring attention to it. I do these fundraising events. There's so many people working so much harder behind the scenes and I really even personally have no idea -- I have a sense -- of how much goes into it."" But Rinehart said he feels very differently about Black's contribution toward finding a cure. ""Rett syndrome is a rare disorder and because of that, a lot of people have never heard of it. And that's a challenge for us,"" Rinehart said. ""So when someone like Clint Black comes along and who is willing to take something that is honestly really private and painful for their family, and to have the courage to come public about that, and be an advocate for us, and talk about our progress, and talk about the hope that we have -- that's very encouraging."" Rinehart continued, ""Our hope is it (Rett's) will become a household name ... so we'll be able to spot someone with Rett syndrome and direct them to help."" Rinehart said a lot of assistance is available for girls with Rett's, and Black's help is measurable because ""more people are giving and more research is possible because of that, and that gives a lot of hope to a lot of families."" These women and girls, who Black calls ""Rett's Angels,"" lack the ability to communicate verbally, so he is devoted to raising his voice for them. ""I think the human, knee-jerk reaction is to look away. Because it's really hard to see ...but the more I see, the more I see the families and how hard they fight, the more I realize we, we can't look away, we have to look. We have to see."" ""And I tell myself when I'm looking at these children that these are the divine among us. They're the ones that have been given the hardest paths. And so I feel like it's a real privilege for me to come in contact with them. And that's how I deal with it emotionally."" ""I remember seeing an interview with someone a long time ago who had a near-death experience, and said she had been visited by angels,"" Black said. ""And she was told that those with the hardest paths are the most divine. That they chose the hardest paths to help those around them. So that stuck with me. So when I'm meeting a family who's really suffering with this and see the child, that's the perspective I choose to have.""","Singer-songwriter Clint Black lost his niece to Rett syndrome .

"(Mashable) -- Apple's social network Ping will be gone in the next release of iTunes, reports All Things Digital, citing sources close to the company. Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted that Apple has all but given up on Ping in May, though he didn't precisely say whether Apple will kill the service. ""We tried Ping, and I think the customer voted and said this isn't something I want to put a lot of energy into,"" said Cook. Unlike Apple's hardware and software products, most of which have been tremendously successful in the last couple of years, the company's social network has been poorly received from the very beginning. Besides the fact it was available only to a limited subset of iTunes users, it also had issues with spam and a serious lack of artist profiles. With the announced Facebook integration with iOS 6, which is now almost an integral part of the OS (just like Twitter), it makes sense that Apple is no longer interested in maintaining Ping.

"(CNN) -- Some Web designers are staging an online revolt against an old version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, which they say is hampering the ability of the Web to move forward in a cool and interactive way. Some Web developers are trying to weed an old version of Internet Explorer from peoples' computers. The designers say Internet Explorer 6, which was released in 2001 and since has been updated twice by Microsoft Corp., is crippling the Internet's potential and slowing down the online experience. They also blame IE 6 for giving webmasters a collective headache, because they have to write special ""hacks"" into Web code to accommodate an outmoded browser. An estimated 15 to 25 percent of people still use IE 6 as their portal to the Internet, according to two Web monitors. In recent months, several Web companies have launched sites devoted to the idea of undermining or killing Internet Explorer 6. The most recent site, called ""IE 6 No More,"" has gained momentum this week on social-media sites like Twitter and Digg in part because a number of respected Internet start-up companies have signed onto the campaign. The ""IE 6 No More"" site provides Web developers with a piece of code -- an online hurdle, essentially -- they can install to encourage Internet users to download a new browser before coming back to the site. ""As any Web developer will tell you, working with IE 6 is one of the most difficult and frustrating things they have to deal with on a daily basis, taking up a disproportionate amount of their time,"" an introduction on the site says. ""Beyond that, IE 6's support for modern Web standards is very lacking, restricting what developers can create and holding the Web back."" On the surface, the campaign against IE 6 may seem like a cult of disgruntled techies who are angry at Microsoft or want to gripe about people who lag behind the technological curve. But that analysis is too simplistic, said Dan Oliver, editor of .net, a UK magazine about Web design. ""This isn't an anti-Microsoft campaign,"" he said. ""Microsoft makes some fantastic products. The latest version of their browser is a good browser. But with regards to IE 6 ... [it] is an awful browser and no one should be using it."" He added: ""Ultimately, we've kind of waited long enough. That's why there's a big movement of support for it because the geeks out there have known about this for years and have been waiting for big sites to jump on and push it forward."" In a statement to CNN, Microsoft said it also wants people to turn away from IE 6. ""Microsoft has consistently recommended that consumers upgrade to the latest version of our browser,"" the company said. ""Internet Explorer 8 offers improvements in speed, security and reliability as well as new features designed for the way people use the Web."" Oliver said his magazine started an anti-IE 6 Web site about three months ago. The movement has been growing among savvy Web developers for years, he said, but has hit a groundswell since bigger-name Internet companies jumped aboard. YouTube, for instance, now sends a message to Internet Explorer 6 users who visit the site, asking them to upgrade to another browser like Internet Explorer 8, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. The video-streaming site will continue to function in a basic way for IE 6 users, according to a statement sent to CNN by YouTube. But bigger problems for IE 6 may be on the horizon as the Web becomes more complicated. Developers are already working with a new Web language -- called HTML 5 -- that is expected to make Web sites able to display flashier video, save documents to computers more easily and act more like traditional computer applications. When that shift comes, IE 6 will doubtlessly perish, said Ben Parr, a writer for the social-networking news blog Mashable. ""We're about to hit a breaking point where innovation will be stifled if Web sites must continue to cater to this browser,"" he wrote in a post titled, ""IE 6 Must Die for the Web to Move On."" The browser's popularity is declining as newer versions of Internet Explorer become more widely used. But it's unclear whether everyone who continues to use IE 6 does so by choice. Many businesses have built computer applications that run on the browser, and upgrades to those systems can be costly and difficult. That makes campaigns that tell people to switch their browser ineffective, Mark Trammell, a Digg employee, wrote on the company's blog. ""Giving them a message saying, 'Hey! Upgrade!' in this case is not only pointless; it's sadistic,"" he wrote, also noting that Digg likely will stop supporting IE 6 for some of the site's functions. That leaves some Web sites trying to find a middle ground. They want to be cutting-edge, but they also don't want to alienate IE 6 users and business clients. Justin.tv, which lets people stream video live online, is among the sites trying to strike a balance. The company is backing an anti-IE 6 Web site, but Evan Solomon, the site's vice-president for marketing, said the best thing that will come out of this discussion is that more people will become aware that there are alternatives in Web browsers. It's also important to know how much those browsers control a person's Internet experience, he said. ""It sucks for us if someone comes to the site and has a bad experience and the reason that happens is because they use a browser that was developed 10 years ago,"" he said.","Some Web developers are trying to rid Internet Explorer 6 from peoples' computers .
They say the 8-year-old browser is stalling future development of the Web .
Still, IE 6 is among the most common ways for people to access the Internet .
Other free browsers like IE 8, Firefox and Chrome are far better, experts say ."
"Johannesburg (CNN) -- A South African high court ruled Tuesday that cameras will be allowed in court for part of athlete Oscar Pistorius' trial in the killing of his girlfriend. Judge Dunstan Mlambo in Pretoria High Court delivered his ruling -- which will put cameras in a criminal trial for the first time in South Africa -- in response to several local media broadcasters' applications to broadcast the trial live. Pistorius goes on trial on March 3, accused of murdering his girlfriend, model and law school graduate Reeva Steenkamp, just over a year ago. The double amputee Olympic star does not deny killing Steenkamp, but he says he mistook her for a home invader when he shot her in the bathroom of his upscale home in Pretoria. In his ruling, Mlambo said the question of whether the trial should be televised shows the conflict between the right of the accused to a fair trial and the right to freedom of expression for the media and the principle of open justice. To balance those interests, the judge said Pistorius and defense witnesses, as well as prosecution witnesses who choose not to give consent, should not be filmed by TV cameras as they testify. He also placed some limitations on still photography. However, the prosecution and defense opening statements and closing arguments, police evidence and experts' testimony can be broadcast on TV, Mlambo said, and live audio recording for radio broadcast will be permitted for the whole trial. ""The justice system is still perceived as treating the rich and famous with kid gloves whilst being harsh on the poor and vulnerable,"" the judge said. ""Enabling a larger South African society to follow first-hand the criminal proceedings which involve a celebrity, so to speak, will go a long way into dispelling these negative and unfounded perceptions about the justice system, and will inform and educate society regarding the conduct of criminal proceedings."" Pistorius' legal team had argued that some witnesses would be inhibited and potentially traumatized by intrusive filming as they gave their testimony. The legal team for Steenkamp's family also said it did not want the trial televised. Since being freed on bail, Pistorius has remained largely out of the spotlight. He released a statement on the anniversary of Steenkamp's death, saying he would carry the ""complete trauma"" of the day forever. ""No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved -- and continues to love Reeva,"" he said on his website. Steenkamp's family members, including her mother, have said they will attend the trial. It will be the first time they will face their daughter's boyfriend in court. CNN's Robyn Curnow reported from Johannesburg, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Kim Norgaard contributed to this report.","High court judge rules that Oscar Pistorius' murder trial can be televised in part .

"(CNN) -- Fiona Apple's recent decision to postpone her South American tour to stay home with her elderly and ailing dog may have caused some upset among her fans, but she's won a whole pack of new ones who thoroughly support and understand that decision all too well. I am one of them. Mordred told us when it was time for him to go. I'd always heard that a suffering animal would do that, but he was my first dog, and I was thoroughly unprepared for how clear and desperate that message would be. ""Mordred"" was a massive name for a mammoth dog, the Irish Wolfhound my now-husband owned when I met him. He became mine also, and I his -- so fiercely that he escorted me down the aisle when Douglas and I wed a year and half later. We were not always so gracefully aligned. The night I met Mordred, he tried to kill me. I tried not to take it personally, as he was being a good dog protecting his Dad from the strange lady who'd apparently come over to eat his face. It was our second date, and I was deeply enamored of the notion that in New York City, I'd found an attractive, single, straight 30-something man with the wherewithal to be responsible for the welfare of two animals who had to be escorted outside to poop. Losing a dog: Share your tributes on iReport . We were perhaps a shade distracted by frantic kissing as we arrived at his apartment, and failed to take the time to warn the four legged residents that they'd be receiving a visitor. Douglas inched the door open, and a snarling, drooling wall of cream-colored, Muppet fur burst forth. I stood paralyzed, having never seen an animal that size in person outside a zoo -- and certainly not lunging directly at my throat. With Douglas holding him back, I could finally fully appreciate the scale of this beast. With his paws on my 6-foot-tall date's shoulders, he still loomed a full head higher. He was couch-sized. He was pony-sized. He was the most majestic animal I'd ever seen -- and he wanted nothing to do with me. Some dogs -- like Mordred's little companion Morgane the whippet -- give away their full and sloppy hearts as a matter of course. They're in love with the world and show that with enviable abandon. Mordred cared only for his Dad, and whatever bites of food he could snag from the tabletop. I was, at most, a barrier between him and the exact spot on the couch that he wished to occupy. Mordred the Irish Wolfhound helps himself to Kentucky Derby Pie . But that was OK, somehow. I had Morgane (and her Dad) to curl up with elsewhere, and I enjoyed being part of Mordred's orbit and entourage. If you've ever walked an Irish Wolfhound through a New York City neighborhood, you've had a small glimpse into what it's like to be a celebrity. People stare. They gawk. They take pictures at the grossest moments possible. They ask endless, repetitive questions. ""How much does he eat?"" ""Is he a pony? Can I ride him?"" ""How much does he weigh?"" ""How much does he poop?"" (Answers: Lots, no, no, 135 pounds, why in the world would you want to know that?) He strode along the streets of New York City with us in tow, and ran through fields in upstate New York, and I fell into his strong and solid rhythm -- until one day that changed. He stumbled, walking up the steps to the apartment, and then threw up his dinner. As Douglas set about the massive task of cleaning up after that, I ran to the store to get some stomach-soothing soup for him. I warmed it up on the stove for him, then let it cool in his bowl as he stared up at me, slightly dazed, through his long, shaggy eyebrows. He lapped up every last drop and then leaned against me for the very first time. Dogs express their love and trust in many ways -- some lap at your face, knock you down with kisses as you come home, leave a half-dead animal on your pillow, or sit on your lap and sigh with contentment. The large and stoic ones tend to lean. It's a hug. It's the best feeling in the universe. But Mordred -- big, proud, poor Mordred -- he leaned against me the next day after losing control and wetting the carpet for the first time ever, and Douglas and I leaned onto each other, hard and sobbing, when we heard the word ""tumor"" the day after that. Some violent dose of medication shrunk the squash-sized lump then, and earned him and us a year-long reprieve during which that initially jealous beast became a member of my family -- our family. The leans came more and more frequently -- and even the occasional chin lick, which made me feel like the queen of the world (or at least the new Brooklyn apartment that we all now shared). One lazy summer Sunday, with our dogs flanked around us on the couch, Douglas asked me to be his wife, and that very autumn, I walked down the aisle toward him with Mordred at my side, and my best friend holding Morgane in the front row. Our bliss did not last long. The tumors came back with a vengeance, and cancer -- and its treatments -- hollowed my big, beautiful, lush-coated boy to a weak, wobbly, 85 pound skeleton covered in clumps of patchy fur, and unable hold his bowels or bladder. Through a small, saving grace, I had a boss who was a dog lover, himself, and did his best to accommodate my working from home sometimes so Mordred wouldn't have to be alone -- and because I was terrified of what we would come home to. Explaining an animal's death to kids . A colleague with whom I was working on a project did not share my boss' point of view. I tried to convey to her what was going on at home -- that every surface was covered in plastic drop cloths, and that a person-sized creature was gasping and shuddering and dying inside my house, and that I needed to hold him up while he urinated and lift his head to the water bowl. And that while Douglas and I didn't and don't have children, and these dogs aren't our children, they are our family -- our pack. I could not leave a single one of us alone and in pain -- and I respect that so thoroughly about Apple's decision. My entry-level advertising job was infinitesimal compared to the fandom and expectations of a whole continent, and yet she chose to stay where she was needed and care for her own. My boss, for the record, told the unsympathetic co-worker to back off. And one day it was simply all too much. While Mordred had labored and wobbled and leaked, he had still managed to find some moments of peace. A complication from the cancer treatments left him with pneumonia in his rattling, papery lungs, and he ached through every breath. He summoned his strength to lift his head at his Dad, and we made a phone call. Mordred was too weak to walk, so Douglas lifted him into the back of the Jeep for what we knew would be the final time, and we all gathered together on the cold linoleum of the vet's office as I bawled my heart out and Mordred laid his head on Douglas' lap, grateful for the comfort. The shot went in, and the thing that made him Mordred simply drained out, leaving a giant, wasted husk of a dog on the floor, and I watched Morgane sniff it, trying to understand where her friend had gone. For days, she looked for him, under bushes and behind corners, sniffing in the familiar places -- and I suppose Douglas and I were doing the same thing, too. It's impossible to have a creature that physical and spiritual size in your home and not have it leave a gaping wound when it's excised. I suppose that's exactly what Apple was facing when she made her bold, brave and likely costly decision, and she wanted to be there to honor her beloved friend up until the very end. Because once you get leaned on by a dog who loves you, you just can't help but lean right back.","Singer Fiona Apple recently canceled a tour to stay home with her dying dog .

"(CNN) -- Civilian deaths in Afghanistan dropped 12% in 2012 -- the first time that figure has fallen in six years, a U.N. report said Tuesday. The report by the U.N. Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) credits the decline to: . -- fewer suicide bombings . -- a decline in aerial attacks . -- less ground fighting between pro-government and militant forces . -- care taken by those pro-government forces to minimize harm to civilians. Afghanistan's future: 5 burning questions . Deaths down, injuries up slightly . ""The decrease in civilian casualties UNAMA documented in 2012 is very much welcome,"" said Jan Kubis, a U.N. special representative for Afghanistan. ""Yet, the human cost of the conflict remains unacceptable."" Kubis blames the use of roadside bombs by militants as"" the single biggest killer of civilians."" The report noted a marginal increase in civilian injuries compared to 2011. The report comes as the United States and most NATO nations plan to pull their troops out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Civilians in the cross hairs . Despite the overall decrease in casualties -- deaths plus injuries -- militants increasingly targeted civilians throughout the country and carried out attacks without regard for human life, the report said. In total, 81% of all civilian casualties in 2012 were attributed to anti-government elements. The report had harsh words in particular for the Taliban, blaming the group for attacking civilians indiscriminately, even after promising not to target them. ""I welcome strong statements by the Taliban leadership urging its fighters to protect civilians but without enforcing these directives on the ground all that remains are only words,"" said Kubis who called on, ""all Taliban fighters to protect civilians ... and stop using suicide bombers."" Not all casualty groups down . The news was not encouraging for women and girls, who saw their casualty numbers increase last year, according to the report. ""The number of Afghan women and girls killed and injured in the conflict increased by 20% in 2012,"" said Georgette Gagnon, director of human rights for UNAMA. ""It is the tragic reality that most Afghan women and girls were killed or injured while engaging in their everyday activities."" They are often the victims of roadside bombs, tripped by pressure plates embedded in the dirt, the report said. While the latest numbers show the first improvement in recent memory, at more than 7,500 casualties, they're still far from what the UNAMA would like to see. ""Conflict-related violence continued to seriously threaten the lives and well-being of thousands of Afghan children, women and men,"" Gagnon said. ""This situation demands even greater commitment and redoubled efforts to protect Afghan civilians in 2013 and beyond.""","New: Casualties are up among women and girls, report says .

"(CNN) -- In his State of the Union address, President Obama reaffirmed that the country's war in Afghanistan would be over by the end of 2014. He also laid out more specifics. Of the approximately 66,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan now, more than half -- 34,000 -- will come home in the next year, Obama said. At the same time, Afghan troops will assume most of the responsibility for combat missions. ""This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead,"" Obama said. It was previously expected that Afghan forces would take the lead in combat missions by the middle of this year. But a U.S. official told CNN that the military transition has accelerated and that Afghans will lead all security operations by March. What does this news mean for Afghanistan and America's longest war? Here are some key questions that will be asked in the coming months: . 1. Are the Afghan troops up to the task? There are certainly doubts. A Pentagon review in December claimed that only one of 23 Afghan army brigades was capable of functioning on its own. Meanwhile, literacy rates are low, desertion rates are high, and many deserters have joined the insurgency. There also have been a troubling number of ""green-on-blue"" attacks: Afghan troops attacking their American comrades. But Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has spoken positively about the progress Afghans have made in growing their army, reducing violence and becoming more self-sufficient. Afghan forces now lead nearly 90% of operations across the country. ""We're on the right path to give (Afghanistan) the opportunity to govern itself,"" Panetta said earlier this month. Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he welcomes the U.S. troop withdrawal and insists his army can defend the country against the Taliban. ""It is exactly our job to deal with it, and we are capable of dealing with it,"" Karzai said during an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. What the army needs now, Karzai says, is more equipment and firepower. He came to the Pentagon last month with a wish list asking for more helicopters, drones and other hardware, according to a senior defense official. ""We need an air force. We need air mobility,"" Karzai told Amanpour. ""We need proper mechanized forces. We need, you know, armored vehicles and tanks and all that."" 2. What presence will the U.S. have after 2014? The plan is to withdraw all combat troops but keep a residual force in the country to help train Afghans and carry out counterterrorism operations when needed. The size of that force is still being discussed. Gen. John Allen, the former commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, recommended between 6,000 and 15,000 troops. But that figure was lowered to a range between 2,500 and 9,000, according to a defense official. There might not be any U.S. troops at all if the United States cannot come to an agreement over immunity with Afghanistan. There was no American presence in Iraq at the end of that war because the Iraqi government refused to extend legal protections to U.S. troops. Karzai, who's in favor of a residual force, said he would put the immunity decision in the hands of Afghan elders, and he expressed confidence that he could persuade the elders to see things his way. Leaving no U.S. troops at all would be a major misstep, said Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst. He said the U.S. has abandoned Afghanistan already, in 1989, and the decision left America with little understanding of the power vacuum that led to the Taliban's rise in the first place. ""The current public discussion of zero U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan ... will encourage those hardliner elements of the Taliban who have no interest in a negotiated settlement and believe they can simply wait the Americans out,"" Bergen wrote in an op-ed for CNN.com. ""It also discourages the many millions of Afghans who see a longtime U.S. presence as the best guarantor that the Taliban won't come back in any meaningful way."" 3. What's at stake? The main fear among the Afghan people is that the country could revert to another civil war once the United States withdraws its combat troops. The Taliban are still ""resilient and determined,"" according to a recent Pentagon report, and insurgents continue to carry out attacks and pose a major security threat. ""Some people we've spoken to sort of take it for granted that there's going to be a civil war when the United States leaves,"" said CNN's Erin Burnett on a recent trip to Afghanistan. ""It happened before when the Soviet Union left (in 1989)."" For all the violence Afghanistan has seen in the past decade, it has also seen major advancements in human rights and quality of life. ""During the Taliban, basically there were thousands of girls going to school in Afghanistan. Now you have millions of girls going to school,"" Burnett said. ""So there's been real progress on women's rights. Obviously there remain a lot of problems -- honor killings, forced marriages, domestic violence -- but there has been real progress."" Retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, once America's top commander in Afghanistan, said the Afghan people are ""terrified."" ""They're terrified because they think they have something to lose,"" McChrystal said. ""There has been progress made. There is a better life. There are girls in school. There are things that are better than they were and opportunities potentially ahead. ""But they're afraid that if we completely abandon them in 2014, as they perceive we did in 1989, (things) would all go back."" And in Washington, there are worries that the wrong move could put the United States right back where it started, with nothing to show for a bloody conflict that started in 2001. Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, expressed concern last week that a hasty withdrawal could be ""needlessly fraught with risk."" ""Since the president took the commendable step of deploying a surge to Afghanistan in 2009, we have known that our hard-fought gains are fragile and reversible,"" McKeon said. ""That isn't my assessment, but the consistent opinion of experts both military and civilian."" 4. Who will lead after Karzai? Afghanistan's only president of this century won't be in charge for much longer. Elections are scheduled for April 2014, and Karzai has reached the term limit set by his country's constitution. He told Amanpour it's ""absolutely time to go."" ""A new president will come to this country. A new government will come to this country. And I'll be a happily retired civil servant,"" he said. So while Afghanistan oversees a major military transition, it also will have to make a political transition. Who will lead the country during this critical moment in its history? Will the vote go smoothly, without violence and without controversy? There were reports of ballot tampering and other violations in the last one. The answers might be just as important to Afghanistan's security as the readiness of its troops. ""The single biggest challenge for us is the political transition, the elections of 2014,"" said Saad Mohseni, the media mogul behind Afghanistan's Tolo Television. ""(If) we have credible elections, I think we'll be OK for the next five, six years. (If) we don't, there is a real danger that we'll see instability, especially in 2014 as the U.S. troops withdraw."" 5. What part will the Taliban play? Despite the ongoing insurgency, Karzai seems eager to resume stalled peace talks with the Taliban and include them in the political process. The Taliban pulled out of talks last year, but Karzai said last month they ""are very much conveying to us that they want to have peace talks. They're also people. They're also families. They also suffer, like the rest of Afghans are suffering."" Javid Ahmad, a Kabul native now with the Asia Program of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, believes revitalized peace talks are essential to Afghanistan's future and to the legacy of America's war. ""If withdrawing responsibly in 2014 is indeed high on President Obama's agenda, then he has little choice but to prioritize and accelerate the peace talks, negotiate a cease-fire between all sides, and reach a settlement that ensures that the Taliban lay down their weapons,"" Ahmad wrote in a recent column. But will the Taliban be willing to cooperate? And if they enter negotiations, how much of an influence would they have on an Afghan society that has seen so many changes in the past decade? ""There have to be some red lines,"" said Jawed Ludin, Afghanistan's deputy foreign minister for political affairs. ""Some of the achievements that we've had in the last 10 years can't be negotiated."" Karzai sounded confident that most of the Taliban would acknowledge this. ""I think there is now a critical mass in Afghanistan of the educated, of the Afghan people who want a future of progress and stability,"" he said. ""And I think also that the Taliban recognize that this corner has been turned, the majority of them. Some may be there among them who would not -- who would remain, you know, in the darkest of the mindset possible. But those are a few.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The nation's growing acceptance of same-sex marriage has happened in slow and painstaking moves, eventually building into a momentum that is sweeping even the most unlikely of converts. Even though he said in 2008 that he could only support civil unions for same-sex couples, President Barack Obama nonetheless enjoyed strong support among the gay community. He disappointed many with his conspicuously subdued first-term response to the same-sex marriage debate. Last year, after Vice President Joe Biden announced his support, the president then said his position had evolved and he, too, supported same-sex marriage. So it was no small matter when on Thursday the Obama administration formally expressed its support of same-sex marriage in a court brief weighing in on California's Proposition 8, which bans same-sex weddings. The administration's effort was matched by at least 100 high-profile Republicans â€” some of whom in elections past depended on gay marriage as a wedge issue guaranteed to rally the base â€” who signed onto a brief supporting gay couples to legally wed. Obama on same-sex marriage: Everyone is equal . Then there are the polls that show that an increasing number of Americans now support same-sex marriage. These polls show that nearly half of the nation's Catholics and white, mainstream Protestants and more than half of the nation's women, liberals and political moderates all support same-sex marriage. According to Pew Research Center polling, 48% of Americans support same-sex marriage with 43% opposed. Back in 2001, 57% opposed same-sex marriage while 35% supported it. In last year's presidential election, same-sex marriage scarcely raised a ripple. That sea change is not lost on the president. ""The same evolution I've gone through is the same evolution the country as a whole has gone through,"" Obama told reporters on Friday. Craig Rimmerman, professor of public policy and political science at Hobart and William Smith colleges says there is history at work here and the administration is wise to get on the right side. ""There is no doubt that President Obama's shifting position on Proposition 8 and same-sex marriage more broadly is due to his desire to situate himself on the right side of history with respect to the fight over same-sex marriage,"" said Rimmerman, author of ""From Identity to Politics: The Lesbian and Gay Movements in the United States."" ""I also think that broader changes in public opinion showing greater support for same-sex marriage, especially among young people, but in the country at large as well, has created a cultural context for Obama to alter his views."" For years, Obama had frustrated many in the gay community by not offering full-throated support of same-sex marriage. However, the president's revelation last year that conversations with his daughters and friends led him to change his mind gave many in that community hope. Last year, the Obama administration criticized a measure in North Carolina that banned same-sex marriage and made civil unions illegal. The president took the same position on a similar Minnesota proposal. Obama administration officials point to what they see as the administration's biggest accomplishment in the gay rights cause: repealing ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the military's ban on openly gay and lesbian members serving in the forces. Then there was the president's inaugural address which placed the gay community's struggle for equality alongside similar civil rights fights by women and African-Americans. ""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law, for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal, as well,"" Obama said in his address after being sworn in. In offering its support and asserting in the brief that ""prejudice may not be the basis for differential treatment under the law,"" the Obama administration is setting up a high stakes political and constitutional showdown at the U.S. Supreme Court over a fast-evolving and contentious issue. The justices will hear California's Proposition 8 case in March. That case and another appeal over the federal Defense of Marriage Act will produce blockbuster rulings from the justices in coming months. Beyond the legal wranglings there is a strong social and historic component, one that has helped open the way for the administration to push what could prove to be a social issue that defines Obama's second term legacy, Rimmerman said. The nation is redefining itself on this issue, as well. Pew survey: Changing attitudes on gay marriage . The changes are due, in part, to generational shifts. Younger people show a higher level of support than their older peers, according to Pew polling ""Millennials are almost twice as likely as the Silent Generation to support same-sex marriage."" ""As people have grown up with people having the right to marry the generational momentum has been very, very strong,"" said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, a gay rights organization. That is not to say that there isn't still opposition. Pew polling found that most Republicans and conservatives remain opposed to same-sex marriage. In 2001, 21% of Republicans were supportive; in 2012 that number nudged slightly to 25%. Conservative groups expressed dismay at the administration's same-sex marriage support. ""President Obama, who was against same-sex 'marriage' before he was for it, and his administration, which said the Defense of Marriage Act was constitutional before they said it was unconstitutional, has now flip-flopped again on the issue of same-sex 'marriage,' putting allegiance to extreme liberal social policies ahead of constitutional principle,"" Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said in a statement. But there are signs of movement even among some high profile Republican leaders . Top Republicans sign brief supporting same-sex marriage . The Republican-penned friend of the court brief, which is designed to influence conservative justices on the high court, includes a number of top officials from the George W. Bush administration, Mitt Romney's former campaign manager and former GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman. It is also at odds with the Republican Party's platform, which opposes same-sex marriage and defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Still, with White House and high-profile Republican support, legal and legislative victories in a number of states and polls that show an increasing number of Americans support same sex-marriage, proponents feel that the winds of history are with them. ""What we've seen is accelerating and irrefutable momentum as Americans have come to understand who gay people are and why marriage matters,"" Wolfson said. ""We now have a solid national majority and growing support across every demographic. We have leaders across the spectrum, including Republicans, all saying it's time to end marriage discrimination."" CNN's Peter Hamby, Ashley Killough and Bill Mears contributed to this report.","The president and the nation have shifted perspectives on same-sex marriage .
Supreme Court ruling on California's same-sex marriage ban a critical test .
Growing public support for gay marriage give proponents hope for change ."
"Washington (CNN) -- The chief executive officer of NPR resigned Wednesday after a series of controversies at the public broadcaster formerly known as National Public Radio. A statement posted on the NPR website by board chairman Dave Edwards said the organization's board of directors accepted Vivian Schiller's resignation ""with understanding, genuine regret and great respect for her leadership of NPR these past two years."" Schiller's resignation came a day after Ron Schiller, NPR's former senior vice president for fundraising, was shown in an undercover video calling the Tea Party ""racist"" and ""scary"" and questioning whether NPR needs federal funding. Ron Schiller, who is not related to Vivian Schiller, issued an apology Tuesday night and said his already-announced resignation would be effective immediately. In his statement to NPR employees, Edwards said he recognizes ""the magnitude of this news -- and that it comes on top of what has been a traumatic period for NPR and the larger public radio community. The board is committed to supporting NPR through this interim period and has confidence in NPR's leadership team."" Joyce Slocum, NPR's senior vice president of legal affairs and general counsel, was appointed as interim CEO under a succession plan the board adopted in 2009, Edwards' statement said. The board will establish a committee ""that will develop a timeframe and process for the recruitment and selection of new leadership,"" he said. Edwards credited Vivian Schiller with bringing ""vision and energy"" to NPR and leading it back from ""the enormous economic challenges of the previous two years. She was passionately committed to NPR's mission and to stations and NPR working collaboratively as a local-national news network."" NPR spokeswoman Anna Christopher said she could not confirm reports that Vivian Schiller was forced out. Filmmaker James O'Keefe said Tuesday the video featuring Ron Schiller was part of a sting operation. He said the idea stemmed from an incident in October when NPR fired analyst Juan Williams after Williams said he gets worried when he sees people wearing Muslim garb on airplanes. ""My colleague Shaughn Adeleye who posed as one of the members of the Muslim Brotherhood was pretty offended with what happened with Juan Williams and he suggested looking into NPR after that incident back in the fall,"" O'Keefe told CNN's Brian Todd on Tuesday. ""My other colleague, Simon Templar, came up with the idea to have a Muslim angle since Juan Williams was fired due to his comments. So we decided to see if there was a greater truth or hidden truth amongst these reporters and journalists and executives."" Williams has since been hired full-time by FOX News. His firing by NPR prompted criticism by conservative politicians who raised questions about government funding for the public broadcaster. In an interview with CNN scheduled for broadcast Wednesday night on ""John King USA,"" radio show host Diane Rehm said the criticism of NPR by conservatives is politically motivated. ""I think that what's happening here is that not only are they looking at the budget but they're looking at a way to silence public broadcasting,"" said Rehm, whose show is broadcast on NPR outlets across the country. She rejected calls to cut off funding for NPR, saying the public broadcaster was established ""to entitle people across the country to get a wide range of views and that's what it's done. Why shouldn't we keep on doing that? If public funding goes, the system out there is going to suffer."" Despite the current controversies, Rehm said she expects at least some of NPR's government funding to survive the current budget wars in Washington and the political onslaught by conservatives. ""I don't think public broadcasting is going to be zeroed out because I don't believe people across this country want to see public funding zeroed out,"" Rehm said. ""I think they may feel that, like every other institution, it needs to be reduced because of the deficit, but not zeroed out."" O'Keefe gained notoriety for posing as a pimp and secretly taping damaging conversations with employees at the Association of Community Organizations for Reform (ACORN). He was also involved in a failed plot to embarrass a CNN correspondent on hidden camera. A PBS spokeswoman indicated Wednesday that her network also received an invitation from the men to meet for similar purposes, but broke off communication when an attempt to confirm the existence of their alleged organization proved ""unsatisfactory."" In the NPR video, Ron Schiller and another NPR executive are shown having lunch with potential donors, who were really working undercover for O'Keefe, posing as representatives of a Muslim organization considering making a $5 million donation. ""Tea Party people"" aren't ""just Islamaphobic, but really xenophobic,"" Ron Schiller says on the recording. ""I mean basically they are, they believe in sort of white, middle-America gun-toting. I mean, it's scary. They're seriously racist, racist people."" He went on to say, ""The Tea Party is fanatically involved in people's personal lives and very fundamental Christian. I wouldn't even call it Christian. It's this weird evangelical kind of move."" In the video, Ron Schiller says that NPR, which is partially funded by government money, would be ""better off without federal funding."" ""The problem is that if we lost it now, a lot of stations would go dark,"" he said. Late Tuesday evening, Ron Schiller issued an apology through NPR. ""While the meeting I participated in turned out to be a ruse, I made statements during the course of the meeting that are counter to NPR's values and also not reflective of my own beliefs,"" Schiller said in a statement. ""I offer my sincere apology to those I offended. I resigned from NPR, previously effective May 6, to accept another job. In an effort to put this unfortunate matter behind us, NPR and I have agreed that my resignation is effective today."" NPR spokeswoman Dana Davis Rehm on Tuesday condemned Ron Schiller's remarks, saying they ""are contrary to everything we stand for ... and we completely disavow the views expressed."" ""NPR is fair and open minded about the people we cover,"" said Rehm, NPR's senior vice president for marketing, communications, and external relations. ""Our reporting reflects those values every single day -- in the civility of our programming, the range of opinions we reflect and the diversity of stories we tell."" Rehm also decried Ron Schiller's statement that NPR would be ""better off without federal funding,"" saying it ""does not reflect reality. The elimination of federal funding would significantly damage public broadcasting as a whole."" Ron Schiller previously said he had accepted a position at the Aspen Institute, an organization which, according to its mission statement, aims to ""foster values-based leadership encouraging individuals to reflect on the ideals and ideas that define a good society and to provide a neutral and balanced venue for discussing and acting on critical issues."" The Aspen Institute said in a statement Wednesday that Ron Schiller will not be working there. ""Ron Schiller has informed us that, in light of the controversy surrounding his recent statements, he does not feel that it's in the best interests of the Aspen Institute for him to come work here,"" the organization said.

"(CNN) -- Meet Pat Conroy's family. There's Don Conroy, his father, a much-decorated Marine fighter pilot nicknamed ""The Great Santini."" He had a volatile temper and terrorized his children, particularly Pat, his oldest. ""I hated my father long before I knew there was a word for hate,"" he writes in his recently released memoir, ""The Death of Santini."" There's Peg Conroy, his mother, who presented herself as a Southern belle and raised Pat and his six siblings. She threatened to leave the abusive Don constantly, but stayed for years, helping to create what Pat saw as a household of haunted souls. One sister is now estranged; one brother committed suicide. Of course, if you've read Pat Conroy's novels -- including ""The Great Santini,"" ""The Prince of Tides"" and ""Beach Music"" -- you've probably already met his family. ""I've been writing the story of my own life for 40 years,"" he observes in the new book. It hasn't always been fiction, either. Conroy has two other memoirs to his credit, 1972's ""The Water Is Wide"" (about a year teaching on a poverty-stricken South Carolina island) and 2002's ""My Losing Season"" (about his Citadel basketball team). But in ""The Death of Santini,"" Conroy decided to confront his personal history more directly. He interviewed family members and friends, retells old stories from new angles and tries to put himself in the shoes of his parents. He addresses some of his own wounds, including the stepdaughter -- brought to fictional life in ""Beach Music"" -- who hasn't spoken to him in more than 14 years. ""This is my punishment for coming out of this family, I think,"" he says in a phone interview. ""It is the hardest thing I've ever dealt with."" The book has generally received positive reviews. ""(It) recognizes that while fiction calls for lucid explanations and a certain tidiness, life resists both,"" wrote Frank Bruni in The New York Times Book Review. CNN caught up with Conroy by phone in Minneapolis, where he was staying during an early tour stop. Though the South Carolina-based writer was still shaking off travel fatigue, he waxed eloquent on his complicated relationship with family members, the toll of violence and even bullying in the NFL. The following is an edited and condensed version of the interview. CNN: Why did you decide to write this memoir, considering it's material you've already used in your novels? Pat Conroy: Mom and Dad had to die before I could do this. All my books have been hinting around at so much of this, and I wanted to get down what I think happened. And after writing ""The Great Santini,"" I think I owed Dad something for the way he made a turnaround. That was remarkable to me. He did something very good and very rare in a human life when he did it. CNN: After ""Santini"" comes out, in the book you go from using the word ""hate"" about your father to what seems like respect and then love. Conroy: He was the meanest man I ever met in my life, and I could not believe my bad fortune of me and my brothers and sisters being raised by this guy and my poor mother being married to the guy. It was only when ""The Great Santini"" was published he seemed to even take a look at who he was. CNN: He doesn't seem to be the most introspective gentleman. Conroy: Oh, please. I don't think Dad had a moment of introspection in his entire life -- ever. Even when I relay (these stories) to the world, Dad simply denies it. He can be funny about it: ""I hope you enjoy my son's latest work of fiction."" Old loveable, likable Don Conroy. Dad was a very charming man. I didn't know that until the book came out. CNN: Your mother knew more of herself than she let on. On the outside she was a polished Southern belle, and on the inside she came from hardscabble Alabama. And she hated to admit that. Conroy: I can see it from Mom's point of view now. She was from the poorest white South possible. She ends up marrying a Marine Corps officer, so she was an officer's wife. She had these seven children, and when we would pray that she would leave Dad or divorce him, she had nowhere to go and no way to raise these children. I think Mom was perfectly trapped. I adored her, and some of the brothers and sisters do not. They blame Mom for putting us through that. I didn't think she had a chance. CNN: I read some of the book with my jaw hanging open, yet I have mixed feelings about your sister Carol Ann, who has cut herself off from the family. Conroy: Carol was the one who did what was probably the natural thing -- the family damaged her, she realized it damaged her, and she said bye-bye to all this. We only see Carol at funerals and weddings. She doesn't talk to any of us. We don't have a relationship with her. But I think that's a natural order of things in families this conflicted and this brutalized. You lose a couple of 'em along the way. CNN: Is Carol Ann really as operatic as she comes off in the book? Conroy: Oh my God, are you kidding? She wins that award more than anybody I've ever known. It's her way with the world. CNN: I wonder, given your violent household, if you've given any thought to what's in the headlines -- the bullying with the Miami Dolphins, the stress on military families with PTSD. Conroy: The thing with Miami ... what I think that poor Stanford kid (Jonathan Martin) should have done is sucker-punch (Richie) Incognito. Generally, in a male situation, that is what helps. (But) obviously this guy is a thinking, feeling creation (that's) rare in the NFL. I think he'll never be forgiven. I think his career is over. CNN: When you write about characters such as your father and his rages, how much do you put yourself in their shoes? Conroy: Always, and totally. It's easy for me. When I hear about 13-year-old kids gunning their father down in bed, I always think, I'm lucky that's not me. I thought it a zillion times when I was growing up. It's a terrible thing to say, but I thought it. CNN: Did you keep a journal growing up? Conroy: No. If I'd kept one, he'd have read it, and that would have been it. There would have been no books. There would have been no me. CNN: Despite the horrific stories, there's obviously a lot of strength in your family. Conroy: Thank you for telling me that, because this (book) kills me. CNN: Well, when it was over, what were your feelings? Was it cathartic? Conroy: What I've noticed is we're sort of stoical. I gave it to my brother Jim, the dark one, and I hear he was most afraid of the book. When I called him about it, he said, ""You know, Pat, I think you've written an adequate book."" (laughs) I said, that's high praise from this family. My brother Tim was the most honest. He said, ""Oh, thanks, Pat. I'll tell you in 30 years whether I love it or hate it. Reading it was like hitting myself with a lead pipe for 350 pages. I hated every minute of it, and I blame you totally because Mom and Dad are dead."" CNN: Did he say that with humor? Conroy: He said it with some humor. But he was reading it to his wife and she kept weeping. He said, ""What's wrong?"" And she said, ""You were just children. You were little kids.""","Pat Conroy's ""The Death of Santini"" is a memoir about his family .

"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (CNN) -- Franklin Graham was stumped. He had no idea what to give his father, evangelist Billy Graham, for his 90th birthday Friday. The Rev. Billy Graham speaks at a crusade in Kansas City, Missouri, in October 2004. Suddenly, it dawned on him. ""I have people who sometimes come up to me and say, 'Franklin, I know I'll never meet your father, but would you mind telling him that I got saved in his meeting in London in 1950?' "" the younger Graham said at the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""I thought, wow, wouldn't it be something if everybody just wrote that little story down and gave it to him?"" So Franklin Graham turned to the Internet to help. For the past few months, people from around the world have been leaving personal messages for the elder Graham at billygraham90.com. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association says it has received tens of thousands of birthday greetings. Read the messages . ""In 1995, I was in between combat tours,"" writes a Canadian veteran. ""I was in my barracks room one night, and I was seriously contemplating suicide. Before cutting my wrists, a voice told me to put on the television. There you were preaching about why we shouldn't hurt ourselves that suicide wasn't the answer. I was loved that night."" Other well-wishers write about how Graham's ministry healed their marriages, reconciled families and led them to lives of service. At 90, Billy Graham remains ""America's pastor."" In over 70 years of ministry, Graham has preached to more than 215 million people in person and in 185 countries. Millions more have read his books and seen him on television. Graham has also prayed with and counseled every American president from Harry Truman to George W. Bush. After Barack Obama won the presidential election, Graham issued an appeal on behalf of the president-elect: ""I urge everyone to join me in pledging our support and prayers as he begins the difficult task ahead."" Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain visited Graham at his home over the summer. ""He didn't ask for one thing except for water,"" Franklin Graham said of the senator's visit. ""He said, 'Dr. Graham, I'd appreciate your prayer. If you'd just pray that I'd run an honorable campaign,' and that's all he asked. He didn't ask for my father's support."" Today, Billy Graham spends most of his time in the remote western North Carolina mountain home where he and his wife, Ruth, raised their five children: Gigi, Anne, Ruth, Franklin and Ned. ""There are a lot of miles on that body,"" his daughter Ruth said. ""His world has become smaller."" He leaves his home only for doctor's visits in Asheville and an occasional Billy Graham Evangelistic Association board meeting in Charlotte. It has been a difficult time for Graham. In summer 2007, his wife, Ruth, died after being bedridden for many years. The grief is still constant for Graham. ""She was just one great woman. She has a lot of steel in her and a lot of determination. ... I just thank God that he chose her way off in China somewhere to come back to America and marry me,"" Graham told CNN's Kyra Phillips in one of his last television interviews in 2005. Graham's family and associates say that his mind is sharp despite his age and that for a man who is 90, he's in good physical shape. ""The lion still has a roar,"" said Graham's spokesman, Larry Ross. Graham exercises with a physical therapist on a regular basis and still swims and takes walks when he can. However, the fragilities of old age are also a reality. In October, Graham spent a night in the hospital after tripping over his golden retriever, Sam. A nurse stays with him around the clock. Graham uses a walker to get around. His hearing is failing. Macular degeneration is stealing his eyesight. Yet despite these obstacles, Graham continues his ministry. With the help of an assistant, Graham is writing another book about growing older. ""I have discovered that just because we grow weaker physically as we age, it doesn't mean that we must grow weaker spiritually,"" Graham said in a statement this week. ""In fact, we ought to be growing stronger spiritually, because our eyes ought to be on eternity and Heaven -- on the things that really matter."" In many ways, these days Graham is making up for the years he spent on the road. ""He really tried to stay in touch with us and be the kind of father that he wanted to be,"" his daughter Ruth said. ""He has said that he's frustrated that he wasn't home for us when we were little."" His daughter Anne, a Raleigh, North Carolina-based evangelist, often stops by to read from the Bible and preach. Graham has often said she is the best preacher in the family. Every Sunday when he is in town, Franklin has lunch with his father. They talk about the ministry and world events. Graham stays connected to the world by watching the news. CNN's ""Larry King Live"" is part of his nightly ritual, Ross says. Graham often prays for the people he sees in the news. After a church shooting in December in Colorado left five people dead, Franklin says, his father was heartbroken. ""He said, 'Franklin, let's pray for those families' ... so I turned the television off, and Daddy prayed for those victims, and that's the side of Billy Graham I don't think people realize."" A family meal of North Carolina barbeque, including pulled pork and coleslaw, will mark Graham's birthday Friday. All of Graham's children and most of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren will be there. It will be the first time Graham's children have all been together since their mother died. The following week, there will be a larger celebration with friends and people who have served with Graham. There, he will be presented with the book of birthday greetings from fans around the world. Graham's children say that despite his remarkable life, he is a humble man who doesn't dwell on the past. ""My father doesn't look backwards,"" his daughter Ruth said. ""He really does see that God was the one who did it, and he just happened to be in the room.""","Graham turns 90 on Friday; large birthday celebration planned for next week .

"(CNN) -- Earth never stops surprising us. Every corner of the planet offers some sort of natural peculiarity with an explanation that makes us wish we'd studied harder in junior high Earth science class. Some of these sites are challenging to get to; others are busy tourist destinations. They keep natural scientists searching for answers and the rest of us astounded by the secrets and mysteries the world continues to reveal. Blood Falls, Antarctica . Most people won't see Blood Falls in person, but even in photographs, the sight is arresting: a blood-red waterfall staining the snow-white face of Taylor Glacier. The place was documented in 1911 by geographer/geologist Thomas Griffith Taylor, a member of Robert Falcon Scott's ill-fated expedition to the Antarctic. (Scott named the glacier for Taylor.) 8 very old sites in the New World . Since then, glaciologists and microbiologists have sought to determine what causes the mysterious red flow. They've concluded that the source is a subterranean lake rich in the iron that gives the water its red hue. Stranger still, recent research has revealed microorganisms living 1,300 feet beneath the ice, sustained by the iron and sulfur in the water. Magnetic Hill, Moncton, New Brunswick . What could possibly cause an automobile to roll backward uphill without power? A magnetic force from within the Earth? Something even more fantastic? Since the 1930s, when the phenomenon of Magnetic Hill was discovered (and almost immediately promoted as a tourist attraction), people have been trying to figure out its riddle. Even though it's been demonstrated that the ""magnetic force"" is an optical illusion and the uphill slope is actually a downhill slope, that hasn't stopped carloads of travelers from visiting Magnetic Hill and testing it for themselves. Digging deep: 15 ancient ruins you might not know . Surtsey, Iceland . When people try to convince you there's nothing new under the sun, direct them to the Icelandic island of Surtsey. Before 1963, it didn't exist. Then, an underwater volcano in the Westman Islands (Vestmannaeyjar) erupted, and when the activity settled down in 1967, what remained was an island where no island had been before. At its largest, Surtsey measured about 1 square mile, but wind and water have eroded the volcanic matter to a little more than half that size. Presented with this unsullied environment, the Icelandic government determined that the best thing to do was preserve it. Thus, although you can sail past it on a Westman Islands day cruise, Surtsey remains off-limits to just about everyone except marine biologists, geologists, botanists and other scientists conducting research there. 8 elegant U.S. mansion hotels . Moeraki Boulders, New Zealand . Large spherical boulders -- some measuring 12 feet in circumference -- are scattered on Koekohe Beach on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island. They formed millions of years ago on the ancient sea floor, collecting and hardening sediment and minerals around a core such as a fossil or a shell similar to the way oysters form pearls. They're not the world's only examples of what geologists call septarian concretions. You can also visit the Koutu Boulders near Hokianga Harbour on the northwestern coast of New Zealand's North Island, for example. Yet the Moeraki Boulders are some of the world's largest. The particulars of their origin and what caused the distinctive cracks inside them are still being studied. Midnight sun, Spitsbergen, Norway . From April 20 to August 23, the sun never sets over Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago that lies north of Greenland in the Arctic Sea. The phenomenon plays havoc with everyone's body clocks. Is it noon? Is it midnight? After a day or two, it's hard to tell. Among the northernmost yet still-accessible places to experience the midnight sun is Spitsbergen, the largest island in the group. The island is well-suited and accommodating to travelers, who tend to keep strange hours in summer and who soon understand why their hotel rooms have been fitted with darkening curtains. Pamukkale, Turkey . What appears to be a Doctor Zhivago-style snowy landscape in southwestern Turkey is actually the result of calcium carbonate deposits from 17 natural hot springs accumulating over thousands of years. Beginning in the late second century B.C., this area near present-day Denizli was a destination for those who sought the therapeutic benefits of the mineral-rich water whose temperature reaches upward of 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Today, you can see remnants of the baths at the ancient holy city of Hierapolis, but it's the stunning terraces, cliffs and petrified white waterfalls of Pamukkale -- Turkish for ""Cotton Palace"" -- that give it remarkable natural beauty. Racetrack Playa, Death Valley, California . How ordinary stones manage to ""sail"" over the surface of Racetrack Playa in Death Valley National Park is a mystery people have tried to solve since 1915, when a prospector and his wife noticed tracks that seemed to indicate that the stones had somehow traveled across the dry earth. Short of cosmic intervention, the stones required terrestrial forces to move them. But what forces? The current prevailing theory about the ""sailing stones"" of Racetrack Playa, presented by a team of physicists in 2011, involves ice that forms around the stones, causing them to move and to leave a trail in their wake. Many visitors still hope for a more mystical explanation. Eternal Flame Falls, Orchard Park, New York . Behind the cascade of a small waterfall in the Shale Creek Preserve section of Chestnut Ridge Park in suburban Buffalo, New York, you might see what appears to be an optical illusion: a flickering golden flame. Actually, you'll smell it before you see it, and amazingly, it's real, fueled by what geologists call a macroseep of natural gas from the Earth below. A geological fault in the shale allows about 1 kilogram of methane gas per day to escape to the surface, where, at some point, possibly the early 20th century, a visitor had the idea to set it alight. The water occasionally extinguishes the flame, but there's always another hiker with a lighter to reignite it. Old Faithful, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming . Yellowstone National Park claims the highest concentration of geysers of any place on Earth. Geysers are hot springs with plumbing challenges that result in eruptions. More than 300 can be found throughout the park's 3,472 square miles, and none is more famous than Old Faithful. In fact, Old Faithful is the reason Yellowstone was designated a National Park -- the first in the United States -- in 1872. Its name comes from the perceived regularity of its eruptions, which occur every 55 to 120 minutes and last for two to five minutes. The spectacular eruptions remain a source of fascination for the more than 3.5 million people who visit Yellowstone each year. The fact that the eruptions aren't quite as regular as they might seem -- and that the mean eruption interval seems to be lengthening -- keeps geologists fascinated, too. Relampago de Catatumbo, Ologa, Venezuela . Thanks to its humidity, its elevation and the clash of winds from the mountains and the sea, the southwestern corner of Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela has the world's highest frequency of lightning activity (250 flashes per square kilometer per year). More than 200 nights per year, with peaks in May and October, lightning flashes fill the sky -- sometimes 25 or more flashes per minute. To put that in perspective: The National Weather Service classifies anything over 12 strikes per minute as ""excessive."" Named for the Catatumbo River, which flows from Colombia in to Lake Maracaibo, the Relampago de Catatumbo, or Catatumbo Lighting, has become a highlight for travelers who spend their nights wide awake and wide-eyed watching the spectacle.","Magnetic Hill in New Brunswick is an optical illusion that has fascinated tourists for decades .
The Moeraki Boulders in New Zealand are what geologists call septarian concretions .
Lightning and the Midnight Sun also wow visitors -- and keep them awake at night ."
"(CNN) -- When I returned home from the Fit Nation Kickoff weekend three months ago, I was tired and overwhelmed, and every muscle in my body ached. This past week, my teammates and I wrapped up our ""midway"" training trip in Clermont, Florida. I am proud and excited to report that the experience left me feeling exhilarated, confident and energized! The best part is that it's not because of any magic pill or potion; it is the result of making a commitment to myself to become healthier. Behind the scenes: Training for a triathlon . I am an overweight 57-year-old, soon-to-be-retired grandmother. I LOVE a challenge and am one of those people who is not afraid to step out my comfort zone for a worthy goal. During kickoff weekend, we were promised that the first few months would be base-building. We were given an overview of basic swimming techniques, tips to help our running form and information on healthy nutrition. We received workouts on a weekly basis that were designed for each of us to develop our endurance, skill and strength. It was up to each of us whether we did them, how much effort we put into each session and what we put into our bodies. I have not been perfect in any of these areas, but life is about progress, not perfection. And I can absolutely say that I have made progress! Training dedicated to slain colleague . In January, I could not even put my face in the water, let alone swim. Thanks to the patience and teaching of my coaches and teammates, I arrived in Florida holding my own in the pool. By the end of the week, not only had I gained more confidence, I had my very first experience in the ocean. Once we survived putting our wetsuits on, we headed into the water at Cocoa Beach. Completely out of my comfort zone, I was content to watch my teammates as they enthusiastically ran into the water toward the waves. I had to laugh when one of the producers, who was in the water with us, said to me, ""So, Rae, you know that the swim in Malibu is in the Pacific Ocean, right?"" I did know that, I told him, but swimming in a pool had been such an overwhelming undertaking for me that I had not spent much time actually processing how much different swimming in the ocean was going to be. That was the moment that I knew I had to take the leap and actually get into water above my knees. I figured I might as well literally dive in and give it a try. Not only did I live to tell about it, I can honestly say it was a blast, and I can't wait to do it again! As I'm more than 20 years older than the rest of the team, there have been a few times that I thought I would have to accept reality -- that I would not be able to do everything they could. The ocean experience was definitely one of them. I figured that if it wasn't something I had accomplished by now, I probably never would. It was exhilarating to find out that I was wrong. Even more important, it was just what I needed to move me past thinking that way in the future. Similar things happened on the bike and on the road. Even though it is not something I have done a lot of the past few years, I have always enjoyed riding a bicycle. I had no idea what a different experience riding a road bike with my feet clipped in the pedals would be. My first two rides were pretty traumatic, and I have the scars on my knees and elbows to prove it. Again, thanks to mentoring and practice, it turns out that I am not too shabby on the bike. Much to my surprise, I enjoy the long bike rides and the accomplishment of making it to the top of a hill that looked impossible from the bottom. The key to fitness? Schedule it in . I have progressed from walking on the treadmill for 2 miles three times a week to actually running the entire distance of a 5.38-mile course on the clay trails outside of Clermont -- another thing I didn't think I could do, even as we were in the car on our way to the trail. The euphoria that I had at the finish line of our first practice triathlon made me forget the struggle to get there. The best part is that feeling lasted for the rest of the day. Here's what I realized at the conclusion of the midway training trip: I will complete the triathlon this fall. I can actually see myself crossing the finish line with my awesome teammates and the new friends whom I have met along the way. It is hard for me to put into words, but I also realized that this experience is about more than the triathlon itself. Being outside of my comfort zone, both mentally and physically, has helped me conquer my fears and self-doubt. It has given me the courage and confidence to keep working toward my goals and dreams, no matter how lofty.

"(CNN) -- There's no doubt that Boyz II Men know a little something about love. The superstar R&B group even used the word as the title of their new album. ""Love"" is their second project of cover tunes and also marks another go-round working with ""American Idol"" judge Randy Jackson, who was a producer on the successful ""Motown: A Journey Through Hitsville USA."" The group covers a variety of love tunes, including Journey's ""Open Arms,"" the Goo Goo Dolls' ""Iris,"" and ""In My Life"" by the Beatles. Boyz II Men clearly still loves performing, as they spend most of the year on the road thrilling fans with their classic hits like ""End of the Road"" and ""I'll Make Love To You."" Members Wanya Morris and Nate Morris (fellow member Shawn Stockman was sick with the H1N1 virus) spoke with CNN about their latest musical endeavor, what music puts them in the mood and whether fans should expect a reunion with former member Michael McCary. CNN: Why name the album ""Love?"" Wanya Morris: The title embodies everything that Boyz II Men represents. Every album we have ever done has always had a representation of love. We tried to reach and delve inside of this album and to not just go with the sound, but also the lyrical content that embodies that representation of love . CNN: Boyz II Men has been around for almost 20 years. How has the music business changed? Nate Morris: A lot of people don't understand that music conforms to the day and times that it is in. It is a circular motion, but it never comes back exactly the same. We believe that the soul, the understanding, of true music has kind of disappeared. There was a time early in the '70s and the '80s when we started getting into the computers and synthesizers that we started getting away from it then, too. Right now, with the auto-tune and all of these different pro tools, we are kind of getting away from it again. This album is the type of album that will hopefully try to steer some of those musical people back in the direction of true music. CNN: There don't really seem to be any R&B groups out right now representing like Boyz II Men has in the past. Why do you think that is? Wanya: Groups are hard to come by. A lot of times, when a group is put together by an entity or a manager, [the members] never really had aspirations of being in a group. With our group, music put us together. We were not contrived by a manager. We loved the way we sounded together, even before we liked each other. CNN: How has Boyz II Men changed? Nate: We have definitely grown in more ways than one. We have children now, some of us wives and relationships. We're very big believers in learning and trying to gain as much wisdom as we can. We've had some ups and downs in our careers, just like people have in their lives, and it's set in a situation mentally where we understand our position in life. CNN: What's the biggest lesson you both have learned as entertainers? Nate: To stay consistent. It's OK to move with the times, but stay consistent with who you are, not just because of who you are, but because of who your fans fell in love with. We try to be different, but we try not to sway too far from who our fans know us to be because you can't gain those people back if you lose them. CNN: What's the first single from the new album? Wanya: The first single we are pushing for is ""I Can't Make You Love Me,"" originally done by Bonnie Raitt. We wanted to stay true to our roots, and it's a very beautiful song. And with our sound, we gave it an R&B twist. It's always been a favorite of ours, and we hope people will fall in love with it again. CNN: Is it difficult to cover songs that are so beloved and have been hugely successful? Nate: Oh yes. There are so many people that have listened to these songs and fallen in love with the song as it was originally performed. We know that these songs have a fan base. We try to put our interpretation with how we think the song should be without swinging too far away from the solid concrete melody. Wanya: Integrity is important. Just like someone doing ""End of the Road."" If they take it so far away from what people know, the fans want to know, ""Why did they do that?"" CNN: Your music has set the mood for so many fans. What do you listen to when you want to get in the mood? Wanya: Marvin Gaye, the Isley Brothers, anything with a nice feel. Nate: Anything lovely and sexy. I always tell people that everybody's feelings about love are different. It's funny because you take a language like English that only has one word to describe ""love,"" while a language like Spanish has four or five. That gives you the understanding that love can mean so many different things to different people. CNN: Any upcoming plans for an album of original material? Nate: Late, late next year, we are planning on releasing a Boyz II Men 20th anniversary album, which we are hoping to be a double CD. There's a slim chance that our fourth member of the group will be back for that album.","Boyz II Men have a new album of cover tunes, their second .

"(CNN) -- A day after North Carolina became the latest state to approve a constitutional amendment defining marriage as solely between a man and a woman, opponents of the referendum are beginning Wednesday to explore their next options. North Carolina voted Tuesday to outlaw same-sex marriage, which was already prohibited in the state. Supporters pushed for the constitutional amendment, arguing that it is needed to ward off future legal challenges. Voters approved the amendment by a 61%-39% margin with all counties reporting, according to unofficial returns from the State Board of Elections. ""It is a very sad day in North Carolina,"" said Tori Taylor, 23, a Charlotte resident who voted against the amendment. ""There were a lot of college students, young professionals who came out to vote. We have gay friends. A lot of us are integrated to that culture. Do you think your friends should have the same rights? It's black and white. Of course, they should."" The North Carolina amendment alters the constitution to say that ""marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized"" in the state. ""It writes discrimination into our state constitution and gives the majority the chance to vote against the minority,"" said Anne Fawcett Krishnan, 33, of Greensboro. But Vote for Marriage NC, which supported the amendment, applauded the passage, saying it solidifies the state ban and ensures the definition of marriage does not change. ""We are not anti-gay; we are pro-marriage,"" said Tami Fitzgerald, chairwoman of the group. ""And the point -- the whole point -- is simply that you don't rewrite the nature of God's design for marriage based on the demands of a group of adults."" Experts expressed concerns that the language of the amendment is so vague, it could strip other unmarried couples of some rights as well. It could affect unmarried couples who live together and bring them unintended consequences on issues such as child custody and the prosecution of domestic violence, said Kathryn Bradley, a law professor at Duke University. It also strengthens the state's position against same-sex civil unions, often considered a precursor to the marriage issue, Bradley said. Some municipalities in North Carolina provide benefits to same-sex couples, and those rights could be lost with passage of the amendment, she said. Opponents of the amendment regroup Wednesday to decide the next course of action, with some planning campaigns in cities across the state this week. The groups acknowledged the loss but urged supporters to keep fighting. ""We can't change the results of this vote, but we can determine what comes next,"" said Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, director of Campaign for Southern Equality. ""When kids across the state wake up, I want them to know that this story isn't over."" Campaign for Southern Equality said it will launch a ""we do campaign to take action"" Wednesday, with events planned across various cities all week. Another group, Equality North Carolina, plans to hold a news conference Wednesday to discuss the amendment. But its backers said they are not deterred. ""Despite the relentless lawsuits and attempts to marginalize supporters of traditional marriage, a clear majority of the American people have not given up on standing in support of marriage,"" said Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council. ""But instead, the evidence suggests they want to see it strengthened and preserved for future generations."" The state House and Senate voted in 2011 to put the amendment before state voters. Both chambers are Republican-controlled for the first time in 140 years. President Barack Obama said he was ""disappointed"" by the vote, describing it as discriminatory against gays and lesbians, a spokesman said. Americans overall are closely split on the issue, according to a recent Gallup survey. About 50% of Americans believe same-sex couples should be allowed to wed -- up considerably from polls in past years. An additional 48% say such marriages should not be legal. Before Tuesday, 30 states had voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union. ""Of states without constitutional amendments on marriage, 45% (nine of 20) eventually recognize same-sex marriage, either by direct judicial decree, by legislative action, or by a ruling requiring that same-sex marriages from other states be treated as valid,"" the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriages, said in a statement. ""Among the 30 states with marriage amendments, none have been repealed."" Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In February, Washington Gov.

Martin O'Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state's same-sex couples to wed as of January 1, and state residents may vote to affirm such a law. Minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina. Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage.

"New York (CNN) -- A small plane with apparent engine trouble made a forced landing Saturday on a busy highway in the Bronx, injuring three people, authorities said. The 1966 Piper PA-28-180 aircraft landed about 3:20 p.m near the East 233rd Street exit on the Major Deegan Expressway, authorities said. It appears the single-engine plane avoided cars on the normally busy highway that connects the Bronx with Westchester County, said police spokeswoman Annette Markowski. The sight of a small plane on its belly near the snowy edge of the highway surprised passing motorists. ""It didn't look like it crashed or hit any cars,"" said Patricia Sapol, 29, who was driving south on the highway with her husband shortly after the landing. ""It didn't look damaged in anyway. It was remarkable, to be quite honest."" She added, ""We're like, Is this really happening? There's a plane on the highway. It was pretty neat. You don't see that every day."" Police said there were three people on board: the pilot and two passengers. The three were were taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, fire department spokesman Frank Dwyer said. A hospital spokesman, Steve Clark, said one man and two women were transported. Two refused treatment and a woman was treated for a minor head injury, he said. The three were to be discharged. Fire officials initially said the three suffered serious injuries. Images from the scene showed the small plane on the highway, surrounded by emergency vehicles and first responders. There was no immediate information about damage to the aircraft or traffic on the highway at the time of the landing, authorities said. The northbound lanes on the Major Deegan -- where the plane landed -- were closed until about 6 p.m., police said. The plane is registered to a resident of Westchester County.","Forced landing in the Bronx on major highway .

"(CNN) -- In March this year, Kenya's President Mwai Kibaki officially launched the new Lamu Port project, a massive infrastructure project that is expected to cost a whopping $20 billion. The red-carpet affair was attended by his South Sudanese and Ethiopian counterparts, Salva Kiir and Meles Zenawi respectively, on a stretch of leveled mangroves, flattened especially for the launch. The new port is part of a larger project, known as LAPSSET (Lamu Port--South Sudan--Ethiopia Transport Corridor), a pearl in the crown of the Kenyan government's Vision 2030, an ambitious program to propel Kenya's economy, like those witnessed in Asia. The LAPSSET project includes an oil refinery, pipelines from South Sudan, transportation hubs for rail, road and air, and a mega port for oil tankers, plus a number of tourist resort cities along its path. Several months on, very little work has been done, even though President Kibaki committed the finance minister to release funds to enable construction of the first three berths. Rumors circulate that the government lacks financial backing even though the local media ascribes China as the main supporters because of their desire for South Sudan's oil. Watch: Bringing Sudanese oil to Kenya . It is no wonder at the speculation. The Lamu Port plans have been shrouded in secrecy ever since the government began its search for capital. The lack of transparency and the dearth of information have created an aura of suspicion and mistrust of the government, particularly among affected communities. Lamu is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The medieval stone town is the home of Swahili culture and architecture. Its rich history is linked to the Indian Ocean trade-world, connecting China, India and the Arab Peninsula from as early as the 9th century. Early stone ruins of Swahili towns dot the area under the care of the National Museums of Kenya. Nearby, a marine reserve protects the islands dotting the Lamu Archipelago teeming with coral and mangrove and home to endangered marine animals like sea turtles and dugongs. Inland, the Boni-Lungi Forest -- last of the coastal forests that once spread from Kenya to Mozambique -- is listed as a protected biosphere with conservationists actively trying to protect the area because of its concentration of endemic plants and animals and the fast rate at which it is disappearing. Lamu County is home to five indigenous ethnic groups: Sanye, Aweer, Bajun, Swahili and Orma, who have lived with political marginalization since Kenya's independence. Each of these communities utilize their natural resources for survival. Traditionally the Orma are pastoralists, Bajun and Swahili are fishermen and farmers, the Sanye and Aweer are hunters and gatherers. Their livelihoods and cultural existence are at stake with the government's plan to build a mega port and transport corridor linking Lamu to South Sudan and Ethiopia. Save Lamu, a coalition of local civil society organizations, is taking the government to court over the port project. They argue that the government is legally bound to provide an environmental impact assessment (EIA) by independent experts and consultations with the community. This, they claim, has not been done. ""We have been the stewards of this land and coastline for centuries,"" says Mohammed Baddi, member of the Save Lamu coalition and a legal petitioner. ""How can the government begin to construct such a huge project with dire environmental hazards without consulting us and without an EIA?"" Kenya PM: Sudan conflict threatens world oil prices . Baddi's words are echoed by many in Lamu. One of the biggest community complaints is the lack of transparency on the part of the government. ""Getting information about the port project is incredibly difficult,"" states Abubakar El-Amudy, chairperson of the Save Lamu coalition. Save Lamu maintains that it is not against the port, but against the way it feels the government is strong-arming the community into submission. ""They say we are anti-port and anti-development,"" states El-Amudy. ""We are not. But we are demanding that the government provide us with information, otherwise it appears that the new port will only benefit a few select people."" And that is the way it looks from the ground. Land ownership is a heated point of contention here. As well it would be, for the majority of the county's land mass is categorized as Kenya government land. Lamu's indigenous communities have lacked legal land rights and, under corrupt administrations, their ancestral land has been a means of rewarding political cronies. Many locals believe that the port project will obliterate their culture heritage. The population of the county, according to reports, is expected to increase tenfold, from 110,000 people today to 1.25 million in 10 years. The incoming migration will make the indigenous communities a minority, thus disabling any political power that they might wield. The population increase is also expected to damage Lamu's status as a world heritage site. At the latest World Heritage Committee Meeting in St. Petersburg, in June 2012, Kenya's LAPSSET project and its effects on Lamu was discussed. The committee recommended that the Kenyan government halt the project until an Environmental and Historical Impact Assessment report is provided to UNESCO. Whether the government will agree is not certain. Meanwhile, Save Lamu's momentum is gathering strength and their court case is pending. The growing opposition to the LAPSSET project by local and international organizations may bring the government to the negotiating table to rethink its plans for LAPSSET. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hadija Ernst.","The Kenyan government has announced plans for a new port in Lamu, a World Heritage Site .

"Birmingham, Alabama (CNN) -- The class of 1963 crowded in a rectangle on the dance floor, the memories of high school fresh on their minds as the band played in a sea of pink and blue hues. Aretha Franklin. Etta James. The Temptations. Just what you would expect to be playing at a 1960s prom. Yet the song that drew the most bodies to the dance floor was ""The Wobble."" Until this hip-hop song emptied the chairs, it felt as if the auditorium had been transported back 50 years. But it's 2013, and despite the full-court nostalgia for the 1960s, that decade was one of the most difficult times in Birmingham's history. Societal tensions over race were so high in 1963 that the city canceled senior prom for five of the city's segregated high schools for blacks. Today, a half century has passed since the seminal civil rights protests that changed Birmingham and plotted a path for the nation away from segregation and toward equal rights. Just like that path, the healing process has been a long one. The Historic 1963 Prom, held Friday and hosted by the city of Birmingham, closed one chapter for these Alabamans. 'A tension-filled city' Growing up in Birmingham in the 1950s, Earnestine Thomas knew the rules of this segregated city. At a restaurant, she could pay in the front, but had to walk around the back to get her food from a cook. She could shop only in certain places; there were neighborhoods that she knew not to visit. ""As a child, I recognized that it was unfair, but didn't understand that there were laws propping (segregation) up,"" she said as she waited for a hair appointment before Friday's prom. More: Segregated prom yields to unity . She treated herself to a hair styling before donning a lavender dress with a sequined jacket and matching shoes. Lavender was a fitting color, she said, not just because it is her favorite, but because it was the school color at Parker High School. It was a day of celebration that she and her classmates were denied in 1963. Segregation in Birmingham permeated everything, down to the Bibles that judges used to swear witnesses in -- there was one holy book for white witnesses and another for black witnesses. Yet members of the class of 1963 recall having the same struggles as any other teenagers, then and today -- parents' rules, scrounging enough money for dates, finding reliable transportation. As often is the case when people witness a historic period, many black high school students in Birmingham in 1963 did not recognize the moment that was upon them. Years of advocacy by civil rights leaders had successfully chipped away at segregation, and students pushed the boundaries -- as much out of teenage rebellion as a sense of justice. Opinion: For Dr. King, everybody in and nobody out . Cynthia May and her friends were the first ones to board the bus the day that the signs relegating blacks to the back of the bus were removed, around the summer of 1962. The teens tested the new limits immediately by sitting in the front. But when whites began boarding the bus, they stood, rather than sit behind the black teens. The teens also noticed that white riders refused to sit next to black riders, so instead of sitting two to a seat, they spread out individually to occupy the seats, leaving other passengers no choice but to sit next to them. Again, the white riders chose to stand. ""It was a tension-filled city,"" May said. It was against this backdrop that the seniors at the black high schools began preparing for graduation. Each May, in Thomas' neighborhood, the graduating seniors would parade down the street. And in 1963, it would be her turn. There was also prom, an American rite of passage. Thomas can still picture her long dress, a blue and green neon attention-grabber that showed different colors in the light as she moved. A neighbor had bought it for her in December. ""Even though it was a winter dress, I was going to wear it to the prom,"" Thomas said. ""But in one fell swoop, that was wiped away."" Civil rights come to Birmingham . There is disagreement over why prom was canceled for those five black high schools in 1963. The civil rights movement was in full swing that year, but the high school students, to an extent, were kept at a distance from it. This would change on May 2, 1963, when hundreds of children, some as young as 6, left school to march in Birmingham in opposition to segregation. CNN Photo Blog: Birmingham's civil rights crusade . Thousands of arrests were made at the so-called Children's March, and when the marches persisted for several days, authorities responded with fire hoses and dogs. ""This was a very controversial thing,"" said Glenn T. Eskew, a history professor at Georgia State University who has written a book about Birmingham during this period. ""There were those who did not believe that schoolchildren should be engaging in civil rights protests. Not only was it dangerous, but they were youth and it was a very confrontational thing."" The images of children being hosed and intimidated by police dogs renewed a level of outrage at the national level that had been flagging. ""It changed the dynamic of the protest dramatically,"" Eskew said. ""It encouraged other youth to participate on one hand, and on the other it ratcheted up the pressure on the forces of white supremacy."" 50 years since MLK's Letter from a Birmingham jail . Only a fraction of students from the black high schools participated. Many were told by their parents not to participate, for fear of losing a job or other retribution. Thomas didn't march because her grandfather expressed concerns that he might be fired if someone saw her protesting. But everyone would be affected by the protests, whether they marched or not. Days after the marches, the school board announced that all end-of-the-year activities were canceled for the class of 1963. No prom, no graduation, no yearbook. The stated reason for the cancellations was security concerns; that in such a tense racial atmosphere, a gathering such as a graduation ceremony or prom could become the target of an attack. Yet many believe that the events were taken away as a punishment for their participation in the marches. If the authorities were truly concerned about the safety of the black students, they would not have met them with fire hoses and snarling dogs, said Bishop Calvin Woods, director of the Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. It was Woods, who was a father with children at the schools, who sued to have graduation reinstated. A court eventually ordered graduation must go on, and it did, though delayed. But prom never happened. Shirley Holmes Sims had her copper-colored dress ready to go when she left school to participate in the Children's March. And copper-colored shoes to match. They would go unworn, and be lost decades later in a tornado. ""We marched down that street and we were singing 'We Shall Overcome,'"" Sims said. ""You think back to it today, and it was truly worth it."" Righting a wrong . Ethel Arms has a line she uses when the topic of high school rites of passage and prom comes up: ""We didn't have a prom because of the civil rights movement."" It puts the memory of 1963 in perspective and justifies the sacrifice. Yet it doesn't change the fact that inside, she has always lamented that she never had that night. Sure, there were more important things going on in Birmingham at the time, but she was just a teenager and wanted those experiences. This time, Arms was on the ""prom committee"" that organized Friday's event. The small group gathered in a hotel room before the dance, laughing and reminiscing about the prom they never had. There would be no prom king and queen elected this time, but the theme of the dance summed up what the night was all about: ""Finally, the Prom We Never Had."" Sims ironed her purple and gold dress as the women placed corsages on their wrists and waited for the limousines that would take them to the prom. Amid the celebratory atmosphere, there were moments of reflection, and thoughts of those classmates who had passed away. In a way, this party was a celebration of what they had endured and survived over the last 50 years, Thomas said. ""As we get older, everything behind us looks greater,"" she said. The prom committee held hands and said a prayer before walking out of the room. This would be their night. The prom was especially meaningful for Ethel Arms, as she and her high school sweetheart, Eugene, had been negotiating with their parents for permission to attend the prom when it was canceled in 1963. They had been trying to figure out where to find transportation to the dance, and how to earn the money to rent formal wear or buy a dress. They later married, and when it came time for their children to attend proms, the couple put extra effort into making them special nights. It wasn't until Friday night, though, in Birmingham's Boutwell Auditorium, that Eugene Arms was finally able to take his own sweetheart to the prom. ""It's really a much more pleasant event because we can afford the attire, we have no problem getting back and forth,"" Eugene Arms said. ""It makes you appreciate everything when we were children,"" he continued. ""The sacrifices people made."" Eugene Arms had attended rallies during the civil rights movement, but out of deference to his parents, he did not participate in the Children's March. The students that did participate in the march faced dogs and water and arrests, he said. ""All we did was give up prom,"" he said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese authorities say an investigation into a massive attack at a train station in the southwest Chinese city of Kunming has yielded a connection to Xinjiang, a restive autonomous region in the nation's northwest. At least 29 people have died and more than 130 were injured, local authorities say. Witnesses described men clad in black outfits stabbing and attacking people with cleavers and knives. The local government officials told Xinhua, China's state-run news agency, that evidence at the crime scene indicate ""it was orchestrated by Xinjiang separatist forces."" No further explanation was given. In October, Chinese authorities also indicated a Xinjiang connection when a jeep plowed into crowds in Tiananmen Square, killing five and injuring at least 40. That incident, which has been identified as a terrorist attack, was ""carefully planned, organized and premeditated,"" police had said on its official Weibo account online. This latest incident brings focus back on Xinjiang province. The region has a long history of friction between Han Chinese, China's biggest and most dominant ethnic group, and the indigenous Uyghurs, the ethnic group that comes from Xinjiang. Who are the Uyghurs? The Uyghurs are a predominantly Muslim ethnic group who live in Xinjiang, an area the size of Iran that is rich in natural resources, including oil. The province shares borders with Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Uyghurs, who speak a language related to Turkish, regard themselves as culturally and ethnically close to central Asia, despite a long history of Chinese rule. Since the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Xinjiang, which means ""new frontier"" in Chinese, has enjoyed varying levels of autonomy. In 1933, rebels declared independence and created the short-lived Islamic Republic of East Turkistan. The Chinese Communist Party took over the territory in 1949 and in 1955 it was declared an autonomous region, giving it a status similar to that of Tibet, which lies to the south of Xinjiang. Why do Uyghurs resent Chinese rule? Over the decades, waves of Han Chinese migrants arrived in the region, displacing Uyghurs from their traditional lands and fueling tensions. Xinjiang is now home to more than 8 million Han Chinese, up from 220,000 in 1949, and 10 million Uyghurs. The newcomers take most of the new jobs, and unemployment among Uyghurs is high. They complain of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces, despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony. Activists say that a campaign is being waged to weaken the Uyghurs' religious and cultural traditions and that the education system undermines use of the Uyghur language. Why is China concerned about the Uyghurs? Simmering tensions have erupted into riots. In July, 35 people were killed in a town about 155 miles (250 kilometers) southeast of the provincial capital Urumqi. State media said ""knife-wielding mobs"" attacked government buildings. The worst violence in decades took place in July 2009, when rioting in Urumqi between Uyghurs and Han Chinese killed some 200 people and injured 1,700. That unrest was followed by a crackdown by security forces. Beijing says Uyghur groups want to establish an independent state and, because of the Uyghurs' cultural ties to their neighbors, leaders fear that elements in places like Pakistan may back a separatist movement in Xinjiang. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, some 22 Uyghurs were rounded up in Pakistan and Afghanistan and detained in Guantanamo Bay. Most have been released and cleared of wrongdoing. China has found it useful to blame ethnic tensions on outside interference, undermining sympathies at home for legitimate grievances, Nicholas Dynon, a researcher at Macquarie University in Australia, told CNN. In October, China arrested 139 people for spreading religious extremism online by posting videos of terrorist attacks or instructions on how to make bombs and other explosive devices. Are there Uyghur terrorist groups? Beijing exaggerates the threat from Uyghur separatist groups, according to Sean Roberts, an associate professor at the Elliott School for International Affairs at George Washington University. Little of the violence that has occurred inside Xinjiang should be considered terrorism, he said. ""Most of it looks like spontaneous civil unrest or isolated revenge violence carried out by individuals or small groups of local citizens, rather than by an organized militant group,"" he told CNN. However, Uyghur groups claimed responsibility for bus bombs in Shanghai and Yunnan prior to the Olympics in 2008. The Chinese government blamed an attempted hijacking of a flight in 2012 on Uyghurs. The U.S. State Department listed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement as a terrorist organization in 2002 in the wake of the September 11 attacks during a period of increased cooperation with China on security matters.","China's Xinjiang autonomous region has a long history of friction .

"(CNN) -- The hottest way to present your resume currently involves just 140 characters and a lot of hype. Twitter resumes -- or ""twesumes"" -- have been touted as the best way for social media-savvy types to snag a dream job. But before you post your own abbreviated CV, it is worth considering its limitations and what tweeting your employment history really says about you. ""I cannot imagine someone explaining their breadth of experience in 140 characters,"" says Sai Pradhan, a headhunter and managing director for Trufflepig Search, based in Hong Kong. ""I know people are calling it an elevator pitch these days, but my goodness, even that's a bit longer. At most it could be an introduction with a link to your CV."" The term twesume (a contraction of ""Twitter"" and ""resume"") began gaining traction in 2011 after it appeared in an article by Sean Weinberg on social media news site, Mashable. Weinberg co-founded the website RezScore, which allows users to upload their resumes and receive an algorithmic-based grading on it. In subsequent years, the 140-character CV has been hailed by some as ushering in a brave new world of truncated, social media-reliant resumes. It was reported last year that U.S. venture capital firm Union Square Ventures and a handful of American tech companies were to only accept links to jobseekers' ""web presence"" -- from blogs to Twitter accounts -- instead of traditional resumes. Read more: Fake Amazon resume a huge hit . Earlier this year, the chief marketing officer of U.S. technology company Enterasys, Vala Afshar, announced that he would only consider Twitter applications for a senior social media strategist position with a six-figure salary. All candidates were supposed to use the hashtag #socialCV and possess more than 1,000 Twitter followers. Afshar says he heard from hundreds of applicants and selected 15 for in-person interviews. ""The main point of this process is that the selection committee, including me, never references their CV,"" he wrote to CNN in an email. ""The process was purely a digital research and conversation-oriented recruitment process."" Although Pradhan is enthusiastic about the business potential for companies using social media, she isn't convinced that Twitter will replace the resume for job-seekers. For her an updated profile on LinkedIn is more useful. However a tidy web presence is increasingly important. International advertising firm Ogilvy & Mather is currently hiring a director-level candidate for its social media team in Hong Kong. Application instructions for a similar posting last year warned: ""Take a look at your Twitter / Weibo profile and if you find the words: maven / guru / expert? No need to apply. We want people whose focus it is to build our clients' profiles, not their own."" The implication is that while social media has made it easier for direct access to companies advertising on Twitter or LinkedIn, it has also made it much easier for unqualified wannabes to jam up the job search. Read more: What's your office personality type? For Pradhan, who recruits middle to senior level marketing and communications professionals, checking job candidates' social media is the final stage in the process. She mentions a recent Asia-wide search for a director of digital marketing as an example: . ""We basically honed it down to five candidates. And at that point, we actually looked at their online presence. We knew them on paper. We had talked to them in person and interviewed them a few times. And then it was time to see that they've actually been doing what they say."" For businesses, Twitter is just part of the evolving cornucopia of platforms to share and engage with potential partners and customers. The same principles that apply to selling goods are also valid for job-seekers marketing their skills. ""Back in the day, the only way to generate authority in your field was to speak at conferences and write papers and things like that,"" says Pradhan. ""Now you can write a blog. Now you can post relevant content to connect with an audience. You can create followers for yourself. It's a way to build credibility."" Whatever the next platform for self-promotion, she urged jobseekers not to abandon commonsense and real-world skills: ""Nothing beats meeting someone in person, shaking their hand and saying, 'I really want to work with you.' That's what it comes down to. Among all these online experiences, the success comes in moving them offline.","Twitter resumes have been touted as new method to land a job .
Format has been hyped up and value questioned by headhunters .
Some companies say they only consult job seekers' 'web presence'

"(CNN) -- ""What do you love? What do you fear? What's in your pocket?"" These were among the questions asked of the world by director Kevin McDonald when shooting ""Life in a Day,"" the remarkable crowd-sourced film that debuted on YouTube in 2011. Produced by Hollywood blockbuster brothers Ridley Scott (""Alien,"" ""Blade Runner"") and Tony Scott (""Top Gun""), and edited from 81,000 submissions from 192 countries, ""Life in a Day"" is a video mosaic of intimate moments from around the world all shot on one random day -- July 24, 2010. The documentary has racked up nearly 7.8 million views on YouTube to date. Now, another pair of director brothers is taking on a similarly inspired project -- this time commissioned by the city of Seoul. ""Oldboy"" director Park Chan-wook and his younger brother Park Chan-kyong are taking on a crowd-sourced video ode to South Korea's capital. Titled ""Seoul, Our Movie,"" the project works like this: would-be participants choose one of three themes -- Working in Seoul, Made in Seoul and Seoul -- and upload a video of less than five minutes on the project's channel from now until November 9. The brothers' joint production company will choose clips and edit them into a film with a cohesive narrative. Participants have a chance to win plane tickets to Seoul, cars and laptops. A dark past . Despite being the most celebrated director from the country, Park Chan Wook may be considered an odd choice for an ambitious global marketing effort for Seoul tourism. Park's startlingly violent ""Vengeance Trilogy,"" which includes ""Oldboy"" and ""Sympathy for Lady Vengeance,"" amassed a fanatic following around the world for its unflinching and at times disturbing treatment of fear and pain. His first Hollywood movie, ""Stoker"" (2013), starring Nicole Kidman and Mia Wasikowska, is a sinister psychological thriller. When he's not exploring violence or Gothic chills, it's vampire horror. Despite the aura of darkness in his work, Park says he's actually an apt choice for delivering a message of hope. So do the project's backers. ""We had other directors in our mind, but we decided to go with director Park and his brother, as we thought they would manage this project with creativity and global recognition and provide opportunity for global citizens to participate,"" says Ki Hyun Kim, director for the tourism business division for the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Park also had the benefit of discussing the project with Ridley Scott when the two were working together on ""Stoker."" Scott produced, Park directed. In an interview with CNN, the Park brothers discussed ""Seoul, Our Movie."" CNN: Fans expect dark movies from you. What kind of story are you planning to tell through ""Seoul, Our Movie?"" Park Chan-wook: I'm sure many don't know this, but I've actually directed a hopeful and bright movie called, ""I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK."" I think it's a common bias from the public that I only create and film the darker movies with serious story lines. Similar to my previous film works, I want to deliver the message of ""hope"" through ""Seoul, Our Movie."" Now, when I say ""hope,"" I'm not referring to the floating bubbles of ""hope"" with unrealistic wishes and dreams that pop as soon as you blow them. I'm actually referring to the solid, powerful ""hopes"" facing reality in this world. In this film, I want to portray a lot of scenes that feature ordinary people in the labor force.

"(CNN) -- Around the world, and in developing nations especially, there is an overwhelming demand for higher education. Despite worldwide increases in tertiary enrolment numbers, there still remains disparity between those with access to quality education and those without. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, only 6% of college-age students are enrolled in higher education. John Defterios: The world's next economic powers don't need the West . That number rises to 72% in North America and Western Europe, but hovers around 20% to 40% for most developing regions, according to UNESCO reports. Without higher education, most people face a grim future. But once you consider the possibilities provided by an internet connection and the growing availability of quality online education resources, the conversation about accessibility shifts from ""where"" to ""how,"" and exciting new opportunities (and challenges) arise. So how do we actualize the idea of education for everyone? Read more: Does Brazil deserve its 'B' for BRIC? At Coursera, only one-third of our students are from the U.S., and 40% are from the developing world. Not surprisingly, three of our biggest countries outside the U.S. are Brazil, India, and Russia, where the number of jobs that require a higher education greatly exceeds the number of people with education sufficient to do these jobs. In Russia, for example, new student enrollments rose 230% since January 2013 (surpassing new student growth from the U.S., which is up 178%). Our large international growth poses challenges in dealing with cultural and language differences. The challenges . Despite our global reach, most of the course material and lectures found on our platform are in English, making the courses inaccessible to many students whose native language is not English. To address this issue, we are taking a two pronged approach. First, we are working with our partner universities in non-English-speaking countries to offer courses taught natively in languages other than English (currently French, Spanish, Chinese, German, and Italian). More from Koller: Top college courses, for free? We are also building up a network of ""translation partners"" - non-profits, companies, and universities - to translate Coursera lectures from popular courses into a selection of languages common among our students. Reducing language barriers opens up new possibilities and applications of online education. Experiments in global learning . Moscow-based Digital October (one of our translation partners) has experimented with creative ways to use online education to transcend cultural and language barriers. The center for new technology and entrepreneurship recently hosted a multi-national ""ideahack."" This interactive meet-up centered around the University of Pennsylvania's online Gamification course, and attracted more than 200 live students from Moscow and 15 students from three continents around the world via video conference, with the event being simultaneously translated for Russian and English audiences. Fareed Zakaria: How to beat inequality . Those attending worked in small groups applying principles learnt from Professor Kevin Werbach's Coursera course. Professor Werbach participated virtually throughout the event. Princeton's Professor Mitch Duneier taught his sociology class to a global audience. He says that: ""Within three weeks I had received more feedback on my sociological ideas than I had in a career of teaching, which significantly influenced each of my subsequent lectures and seminars."" These insights have reshaped the way he teaches his Princeton students on campus. One student wrote to him, saying, ""It has been an incredible experience for me, one that has not only taught me sociology, but the ways in which other cultures think, feel, and respond."" Bill Gates: I just don't see room for education cuts . By their very nature, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) foster an open environment where people from all walks of life can contribute to a thriving collaborative community. Translation of online courses further helps increase access to people from diverse backgrounds, and thereby enables the true globalization of education. Other models for online education are also being explored, such as the flipped classroom, which makes high-quality course content available in conjunction with local instruction. This can provide much needed expansion of education in the many countries that lack qualified instructors. The future . With the rise of online education, the notion of a ""global classroom"" is being discussed by educators and the media alike. To me, achieving a ""global classroom"" means using education to erase barriers between people of different cultures and backgrounds; it means giving people the opportunity to learn without the limits imposed by physical or socio-economic circumstances; and it means giving schools and instructors around the world the ability to transcend boundaries to bring high-quality education to their students. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daphne Koller.","In Sub-Saharan Africa, 6% of college-age students enroll in higher education .

"(CNN) -- The illegal trade in animals is emptying ecosystems and pushing rare species toward extinction. I know this is a topic you care deeply about, because 13,276 of you voted for me to cover wildlife trafficking as part of CNN's Change the List effort. Those of you who didn't vote should get interested, too. The illegal trade in wildlife is valued at $19 billion per year, according to a 2013 report from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, and it's known to finance the drug trade and illegal arms trade as well. Plus, the trade is fodder for some amazing stories -- stories of desperate poachers, daring park rangers and bizarre little creatures in need of protection. Related: Poachers are prey in the Congo . I asked my Twitter followers last week to help me come up with a list of must-read books and must-watch documentaries on the subject of the global wildlife trade. The start of that list is below.

"(CNN) -- Green and yellow auto rickshaws chug through the crowded streets of New Delhi. Tuk tuks sputter on the roads in Thailand to tourists' delight. Millions in South and Southeast Asia rely on these three wheelers -- known variously as rickshaws, tuk tuks or tricycles -- as an affordable mode of transportation. But while beloved by many, the vehicles are also blamed for bottleneck congestion and pollution, spewing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and particle matters that become trapped inside the lungs. ""In many places both inside China and in other Asian countries, the three-wheeler is considered a symbol of a less-than-modern-economy, not appreciated by some image-conscious businessmen and government officials,"" said Ed Benjamin, chairman of the Light Electric Vehicle Association, the trade association for such vehicles. As concerns over air pollution and fuel dependence grow, several Asian companies are vying to become the Tesla of motorbikes to bring zero-emission, light electric vehicles to the masses. South Asian cities have the worst air pollution in the world . There is major interest in turning electric in China, and to a lesser extent in Vietnam, Thailand and India as well, said Benjamin. Chinese drivers hesitant to adopt electric cars . The move to electric is also gaining traction with motorcycle manufacturers, said Benjamin. ""Piaggio, Honda, Yamaha, and others have had production of gasoline three-wheelers that we expect to see in electric versions,"" he says. Japanese company pushes for innovating motorcycles . In the effort to revolutionize the industry, a lanky, young engineer turns on a motorcycle at a warehouse set amongst farmland about 70 miles north of Tokyo. The engine hums to life with a low whooshing sound -- so quiet you have to crane your ear to hear it. The white motorbike's display panel lights up. There are no plumes of smoke gushing out of the exhaust or the odor of gasoline. Terra Motors is a Japanese start-up specializing in electric motorcycles and tricycles, which it plans to market in Southeast and South Asia. Japanese motorcycle brands like Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki dominate the Asian market outside of China, because customers trust the brands and Japanese engineering, said Toru Tokushige, CEO of Terra Motors. The motorcycle industry has to evolve and adapt to electric energy, to avoid becoming like Kodak films, which didn't evolve to digital quickly and was rendered obsolete, he said. Tokushige hopes that Japanese electric vehicles will catch on as their motorcycles and tricycles originally did several decades ago in South Asia. His company is trying to market electric versions in Vietnam, Philippines and India. ""Each country has its own preferences for the eyes and smile,"" he said referring to the front of the vehicle where the headlights are located. The vehicles carry lithium batteries that take about 10 hours to recharge. But would these vehicles work in countries where there are frequent power outages? Tokushige said charging the vehicles are like charging cell phones and would usually occur overnight, when electricity usage is typically low. Several communities are already adapting to electric vehicles and that there are examples of ""reverse innovation"" which is innovation from developing countries that spreads to richer countries, he said. In Bangladesh, he found garages, propped up by bamboo and tin, transformed into charging stations for electric vehicles. ""Some people charge at these garages,"" he said, showing a picture he took in Dhaka. ""They're already achieving a new kind of business where you rent a parking space and pay to charge."" With fuel prices increasing, Tokushige says there is growing willingness to adapt and to find new business opportunities with electric vehicles. And unlike electric cars which are hampered by the lack of charging stations, the electric tricycle taxis usually travel less distance than cars, so they'd be likely to travel closer to their electric source, he says. ""I believe that air and noise pollution issues, along with the ever increasing price of petrol, will push all of these high density communities to electric two- and three-wheelers,"" Benjamin said. Non-OECD Asian countries are expected see as much as a 200% increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector by 2030, according to Asian Development Bank. The Philippines is one of the first nations to make a concerted push towards electric vehicles, which it plans to roll out first in Manila and to the rest of the country. It plans to lease 100,000 new electric taxi trikes to drivers to replace its sputtering, gas-powered vehicles by 2016.","Auto rickshaws or tuk tuks are cheap mode of transit for people in Asia .
They're also seen as contributing to congestion and pollution .

"(CNN) -- A new Lebanese government was announced Saturday by Suhail Bawji, secretary general of Lebanon's Council of Ministers. He announced the formation of the new Cabinet and named the new ministers in a televised news conference. The new government brings months of political infighting to an end following Prime Minister Najib Mikati's resignation in March 2013. Tammam Salam was named in a presidential decree as the head of the new government, the state news agency NNA reported. Another presidential decree accepted Salam's suggested Cabinet and named the new ministers, while a third formally accepted Mikati's resignation. There have been increased tensions in Lebanon in recent months, where sectarian divisions reflect those in neighboring war-torn Syria, and a number of explosions have rocked the capital. Mikati urged the Lebanese people last month to overcome their differences and engage in dialogue or see the situation worsen.","A new government is announced, bringing to an end 10 months of uncertainty .

"(CNN) -- South Korea on Wednesday announced sanctions against Iran -- including government scrutiny of most financial transactions involving the country -- as part of global efforts to quash Tehran's suspected nuclear program. A key Iranian bank also will face ""a heavy penalty,"" said South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Kim Young-sun, according to state media. The Seoul branch of Iran's Bank Mellat has allegedly facilitated hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions for Iranian nuclear, missile and defense agencies, the Yonhap news agency said. Korea also will expand a sanctions blacklist to limit the foreign-exchange transactions of more than 100 people and Iranian entities; step up inspections of suspicious cargo to and from Iran; put those blacklisted on a travel ban; and limit investments in Iran's gas and oil refinery industries. The blacklisted entities include Bank Mellat, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, according to Yonhap. The United States, a key South Korean ally, has lobbied other nations to step up sanctions against Iran. The European Union, Canada and Japan are among those that have done so. Iran is continuing its uranium enrichment activities in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to a report released Monday by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran has rebuffed international demands to halt its uranium enrichment program, saying it wants the nuclear fuel for peaceful uses. The IAEA is not convinced. In low concentrations, enriched uranium can be used to fuel civilian power plants, but in extremely high concentrations, it can be used to produce a nuclear bomb. ""Based on an overall analysis undertaken by the agency of all the information available to it, the agency remains concerned about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed nuclear-related activities involving military-related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile,"" the IAEA report said. Last month, the United States extended sanctions against Iran, saying it was targeting a number of Iranian businesses and groups accused of helping organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Taliban. In June, the United Nations imposed some of its toughest sanctions yet of Iran. The new sanctions include cargo inspections, new controls on Iranian banks, restrictions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a new U.N. panel of experts to help monitor and enforce sanctions, and asset freezes on 40 entities and individuals. Also in June, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions targeting the country's nuclear and missile programs, identifying more than 20 companies and several individuals allegedly involved with those programs.","Measures include scrutiny of financial transactions and cargo inspections .

"(CNN) -- Almost exactly a year ago, Stanford University took a bold step. It opened up an online version of three of its most popular Computer Science classes to everyone around the world, for free. Within weeks, close to 100,000 students or more were enrolled in each of these courses. Cumulatively, tens of thousands of students completed these courses and received a statement of accomplishment from the instructor. This was a real course experience. It started on a given day, and the students would watch videos weekly and do homework assignments. These were real homework assignments for a real grade, with a real deadline. One of those classes was taught by my co-founder, Andrew Ng. In his on-campus Stanford class, he reaches 400 students a year. It would have taken him 250 years to reach the number of students he reached through that one online course. The Stanford endeavor showed what is possible. It showed that it is possible to produce a high quality learning experience from some of the top instructors in the world at a very low cost. At the same time as this project was being run, it had become clear that changes in higher education were desperately necessary. A high-quality education is now a critical need for most people who aspire to a better life, while it continues to be out of reach for many. TED.com: The 100,000 student classroom . In many parts of the world, including large parts of Africa, Asia and South America, good education is often not available because of lack of capacity. Even in the United States, where education is arguably there to be had, it may not be within reach. Since 1985, tuition costs have gone up 559%, almost double the rate of the escalating costs of health care. This Stanford project led to the founding in early 2012 of Coursera, a social entrepreneurship company that hosts around 200 free courses from 33 of the world's best universities, including Princeton, Stanford, Penn, Michigan, Caltech, Duke, Illinois, Washington and others. The courses span a spectrum of topics: physics, biology, computer science, engineering, medicine, literature, sociology, poetry, business and many more. The courses are full courses complete with short video lectures, quizzes and assignments. For some courses, papers or projects are assessed through a peer grading system. They serve a rich community of learners from all over the world, crossing geographic, ethnic and language boundaries. More than 1.4 million students have enrolled to take these great courses, opening new intellectual horizons as well as opportunities. TED.com: Let's use video to reinvent education . One of the greatest opportunities of this technology, one that is yet untapped, is the window that it opens into understanding human learning. The data that one can measure is unprecedented in both the level of detail and in its scale. Thus, we can apply data analytics in entirely new ways to understand what works and what doesn't, ranging from general educational strategies to specific design choices for a given course. This transformation from a hypothesis-driven to a data-driven mode has revolutionized other disciplines, such as biology, and may now allow us to systematically improve the quality of education. This paradigm, which combines meaningful work that can be graded at scale with peer-teaching among students, allows us to offer some of our best educational content to students around the world, at a negligible marginal cost of pennies per student. It therefore makes feasible the notion of universal education, with the potential of some remarkable consequence. TED.com: Teach statistics before calculus . First, it allows us to establish education as a basic human right, so that anyone with the motivation and the ability would have the opportunity to get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves, their families and their communities. Second, it enables lifelong learning. For many of us, learning stops when we finish our formal education. With the availability of these amazing courses, we would always have the opportunity to explore new directions, whether to expand our minds or to make a change in our lives. Finally, it opens the door to a wave of innovation. Because talent can be found everywhere. Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs is living in some remote village in Africa. With access to education, he or she can come up with the next big idea and help make the world a better place for all of us. As Tom Friedman wrote in May, ""Big breakthroughs happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daphne Koller.","Daphne Koller: Three Stanford computer science courses were opened to all online .

"(CNN) -- Will the Christmas Day arrest of one of America's highest-paid television actors spell the end of his career? When that actor is Charlie Sheen, the answer is probably not. Sheen, 44, whose real name is Carlos Irwin Estevez, has known scandal before and has worked each of his arrests, divorces and indiscretions into the canon of bad-boy lore that has made him essentially scandal-proof. ""Charlie Sheen has bounced back from various scandals, and I don't think anyone expects anything more from him,"" said public relations expert Vanessa J. Horwell, founder and Chief Visibility Officer of ThinkInk PR. ""Bad-boy behavior is part of his persona that's been a work in progress since the 1980s. He has bounced back time and time again."" The latest scandal to rock Sheen's world is his December 25 arrest in Aspen, Colorado, on second-degree assault and menacing charges, both felonies, and criminal mischief, a misdemeanor. Sheen has been married to sometime actress and real estate investor Brooke Mueller Sheen, 32, his third wife, since May 2008. The couple have twin sons who were born in March. They were reportedly having an argument when he was arrested. A 911 call released by Aspen police on Monday revealed Mueller Sheen reporting a domestic abuse case and alleging that Sheen was threatening her with a knife. Sheen's publicist Stan Rosenfield issued a statement following the arrest on Friday urging against a rush to judgment against his client. ""Do not be misled by appearance,"" Rosenfield said. ""Appearance and reality can be as different as night and day. It would benefit everyone not to jump to any conclusion."" While any claims of violence against women, whether real or alleged, can be career ending for a celebrity, Sheen seems to be a special case. This is not the first time he has been at the center of a domestic violence scandal, and the stories don't seem to harm his reputation. Sheen's long history of questionable behavior began in 1990 when he was dating actress Kelly Preston. Reports surfaced then that Preston had been shot in the arm. In 2001 Sheen explained to Playboy magazine that it was a ""complete accident. I wasn't even in the room. She picked up a pair of my pants. ... A little revolver fell out of my back pocket, hit the bathroom floor and went off. It shot a hole through the toilet and she got hit in the leg with shrapnel."" The couple split soon after the incident and Preston married actor John Travolta in 1991. In 1994 Sheen was the only celebrity client whose name was publicly released during the trial of ""Hollywood Madam"" Heidi Fleiss. In 1996 adult film actress Brittany Ashland accused Sheen of throwing her on the floor and splitting her lip. Sheen pleaded no contest to battery charges and was fined $2,800. He entered rehab in 1998 after an alleged drug overdose. During the course of his divorce from model-turned-actress Denise Richards in 2006, Richards filed a restraining order against Sheen, claiming he tried to kill her. Sheen released a statement at the time saying: ""Obviously, what has taken place is vile, is unconscionable, is without merit, is a transparent and immature smear campaign. She's claiming certain things. It's baseless."" Sheen and Richards have continued to have a rocky relationship, often arguing over issues regarding the couple's two children Sam, 5, and Lola, 4. Sheen is currently a high-profile pitchman for Hanes clothing products. In one recent commercial, as he attempts to talk with retired basketball star Michael Jordan, he buffoonishly crashes his car and is cheered on for his antics by a parking valet. Bob Oltmanns, who teaches public relations at Carnegie Mellon University, believes that the most recent incident won't harm Sheen's status as a commercial spokesperson. He compares Sheen with Tiger Woods, who was dropped by a number of sponsors in the wake of his own sex scandal where he admitted infidelity, though Woods unlike Sheen has not been charged with any criminal wrongdoing. ""The Sheen scandal is a pretty stark contrast to Tiger Woods. This behavior is built into the fabric of Charlie Sheen's bad-boy profile, unlike with Tiger where it was unexpected,"" said Oltmanns. ""So I think he will bounce back as long as his popularity on his show remains high. People were shocked with Tiger Woods because the behavior didn't fit the image. People are much less shocked with Sheen because the behavior does fit the image."" Sheen, the son of actor Martin Sheen, had his breakthrough film role in 1986 in the Vietnam War drama ""Platoon."" In 1987 he starred with his father in the ode to 1980's greed, ""Wall Street."" He also appeared in the comedy franchises ""Hot Shots"" and ""Major League."" In 2003 Sheen was cast as the lothario brother Charlie Harper on the CBS sitcom ""Two and a Half Men,"" along with Jon Cryer. His character -- a freewheeling and hedonistic commercial jingle writer whose life is complicated when his divorced brother and nephew move into his beach house -- was loosely based on Sheen's own rogue image. In May CBS renewed the series for three more seasons and in 2008 Sheen topped the list of the highest-paid actors on television, earning a reported $825,000 per episode. ""Two and a Half Men"" has an average run of 23 episodes per year. A representative for Sheen said in an e-mail Monday that his client would not be losing his endorsement deal with Hanes or his role on ""Two and a Half Men."" Calls and e-mails to CBS regarding Sheen's future on the show were not returned, but veteran showbiz observers agree that because Sheen's alter ego on the show depends in part on Sheen's real-life shenanigans, his role should not be in jeopardy. ""Business is going to continue as usual for Charlie after the holidays are over,"" said Rebecca Brooks, crisis manager and president of The Brooks Group. ""The events of the past week have been sad, but not surprising, and definitely not career-ending.""","Charlie Sheen is one of America's highest-paid television actors .

"London, England (CNN) -- The volcanic eruption in Iceland has given scientists a unique opportunity to study its effect on marine biology. An international team of scientists is in the far North Atlantic Ocean testing whether volcanic eruptions have a side effect of increasing the absorption of carbon dioxide into the deep sea. The expedition, from the UK's National Oceanography Center in Southampton, was planned several years before the eruption of the volcano Eyjafjallajökull. By chance, it has now given the scientists the opportunity to see how volcanic ash effects iron levels in the water and in turn the growth of the vital organism phytoplankton. Phytoplankton is important to the eco-system because it takes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the deep sea when it dies. Growth of phytoplankton in certain areas is usually limited by lack of iron in the water, and the sub polar Atlantic is believed to be one of these areas. Phytoplankton usually blooms in the spring, but dies back in the summer. However, scientists are testing the theory that the volcanic eruption has increased iron in the water and will prolong the spring blooms into summer. Professor Eric Achterberg, who is leading the team of 22 scientists, told CNN from on board the ship RSS Discovery: ""We are extremely lucky that the volcano has given us a fantastic natural experiment. ""Normally iron is so low here that after a massive spring bloom, it doesn't grow well in the summer. But after the volcano there's been a lot more iron falling in to the ocean, so we have a fantastic opportunity to check whether iron makes the bloom last longer. ""We are seeing enhanced iron levels compared with other years and we think that's because of the volcano. We need to do a lot more analysis back at the lab before we can confirm the volcano has caused extra phytoplankton growth."" The five-week cruise set off on July 4 and is now in the sub-polar region of the North Atlantic between Greenland and Iceland. It follows an earlier expedition in April and May, which by chance coincided with the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull. Prof. Achterberg said: ""The volcano erupted during the previous trip to check how conditions were for the spring bloom. They sailed right into the plume, which was an amazing experience though not particularly healthy. ""They went right up to the coast of Iceland and the ship was covered with ash. There was a real rise in iron levels then."" Despite the unique research opportunity offered by the volcano, which is now dormant, it has forced the scientist to abandon the initial aim of their expedition to test the normal iron levels in the region. ""It upset our original hypothesis that this region is iron limited,"" said Prof. Achterberg. ""But we now have a great opportunity to see if a massive volcano can cause enhanced phytoplankton growth and sink more carbon dioxide into the oceans. ""It's a unique situation because we have never been able to look at this before. This could potentially teach us a lot about how the oceans work.

The far North Atlantic is globally significant because it acts as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Hip-hop artist Soulja Boy faces a felony weapons charge after police say he was carrying a loaded gun in Los Angeles Wednesday. The 23-year-old rapper, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, was arrested after a Los Angeles police officer pulled over a car in which he was a passenger, police spokeswoman Rosario Herrera told CNN. Soulja Boy was booked into a San Fernando Valley jail, but freed after posting a $35,000 bond Wednesday afternoon, according to jail records. The traffic stop happened on a residential street in the Granada Hills area of the San Fernando Valley at 4 a.m., Herrera said. He was arrested on felony weapons and drug charges during a traffic stop on a Georgia interstate in October 2011. Police said they found a ""felony amount"" of marijuana and firearms in his rented SUV. The local district attorney in Carroll County, Georgia, declined to prosecute the case because federal prosecutors took it over, according to a spokesman for the district attorney. The U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta did not immediately respond to a CNN question about the status of the case.

"(CNN) -- The Mexico Football Federation has banned Carlos Vela and Efrain Juarez from national team duty for six months, following reports the pair threw a party at the team hotel after their friendly in Colombia on September 8. Arsenal forward Vela and Juarez, who signed for Scottish side Celtic during the last transfer window, were not the only players punished over the incident, with 11 other squad members being fined approximately $4,000 each. Those 11 included Manchester United and Fulham pair Javier Hernandez and Carlos Salcido, as well as Tottenham Hotspur's Giovani dos Santos and New York Red Bulls' star Rafael Marquez. Unconfirmed reports in the Mexican press claimed that the party, thrown in the northern city of Monterrey, cost around $2,500. Mexico national team director Nestor de la Torre announced the reprimands at a press conference on Wednesday. ""Carlos Vela and Efrain Juarez will be suspended for six months from the date of these events (September 8), for calls for the national team, because there were faults in four sections of the national team rules,"" he said. The other players to be fined were Guillermo Ochoa, Francisco Rodriguez, Andres Guardado, Gerrardo Torrado, Pablo Barrera, Enrique Esqueda and Hector Moreno.","Carlos Vela and Efrain Juarez have been banned from the Mexico team for six months .

"(CNN) -- The world's eco-systems are at risk of ""rapid degradation and collapse"" according to a new United Nations report. The third Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-3) published by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) warns that unless ""swift, radical and creative action"" is taken ""massive further loss is increasingly likely."" Ahmed Djoghlaf, executive secretary of the CBD said in a statement: ""The news is not good. We continue to lose biodiversity at a rate never before seen in history."" The U.N. warns several eco-systems including the Amazon rainforest, freshwater lakes and rivers and coral reefs are approaching a ""tipping point"" which, if reached, may see them never recover. The report says that no government has completely met biodiversity targets that were first set out in 2002 -- the year of the first GBO report. Executive Director of the U.N. Environmental Program Achim Steiner said there were key economic reasons why governments had failed in this task. ""Many economies remain blind to the huge value of the diversity of animals, plants and other life-forms and their role in healthy and functioning eco-systems,"" Steiner said in a statement. Although many countries are beginning to factor in ""natural capital,"" Steiner said that this needs ""rapid and sustained scaling-up."" Despite increases in the size of protected land and coastal areas, biodiversity trends reported in the GBO-3 are almost entirely negative. Vertebrate species fell by nearly one third between 1970 and 2006, natural habitats are in decline, genetic diversity of crops is falling and sixty breeds of livestock have become extinct since 2000. Nick Nuttall, a U.N. Environmental Program spokesman, said the cost of eco-systems degradation is huge. ""In terms of land-use change, it's thought that the annual financial loss of services eco-systems provide -- water, storing carbon and soil stabilization -- is about €50 billion ($64 billion) a year,"" Nuttall told CNN. ""If this continues we may well see by 2050 a cumulative loss of what you might call land-based natural capital of around €95 trillion ($121 trillion),"" he said. ""If we start putting these figures on the table, then governments might actually wake up to this. We've had a financial crisis. We've also got a natural resource scarcity crisis looming fast."" The GBO-3 is a landmark study in what is the U.N.'s International Year of Biodiversity and will play a key role in guiding the negotiations between world governments at the U.N. Biodiversity Summit in Nagoya, Japan in October 2010. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged governments to give biodiversity a ""higher priority in all areas of decision making and in all economic sectors"" and called for a ""new vision for biological diversity.""

"(CNN) -- Frequent fliers on American Airlines and US Airways can now enjoy some benefits of both airlines' mileage programs, American announced Tuesday. The two airlines completed their merger in December and retained the American name for the larger company. While members of American's AAdvantage and US Airways' Dividend Miles will eventually belong to one program, that won't happen right away. This is the first step in an integration process that will last months. ""We're kicking off the new year by bringing our customers the first phase of enhanced benefits, including the ability to earn and redeem miles when traveling across our stronger combined network,"" said Scott Kirby, president of the new American Airlines and former president of US Airways. ""Our customers are ready to reap the benefits of our merger, and we are pleased they'll get to experience these perks they value most so early in the integration process."" Members of both programs can earn and redeem miles on either airline, and eligible travel on either airline will count toward elite status on the customer's chosen program. American Admirals Club and US Airways Club members now have access to both airline clubs, and American AAdvantage Citi Executive cardholders have access to US Airways Clubs. 50 states, 50 spots for 2014 . Elite members can enjoy elite benefits across both programs, including check-in, boarding and checked baggage benefits. And check-in timeframes and elite member boarding announcements are to become consistent across both airlines. This is the honeymoon period for frequent fliers of both airlines, said Brian Kelly, founder of ThePointsGuy.com. ""There's nothing being taken away right now,"" Kelly said. Fliers can pick the benefits they like from each program, like choosing one program's lower mileage redemption levels for similar flights. When airline officials finally do merge the two programs into one, the merged program is likely to retain higher redemption levels for similar flights, he said. Other changes are expected soon. They include the first phase of a codeshare agreement to provide easy access to each airline's global network, which is expected to be implemented in the next few weeks, American said. Upgrades and other frequent flier program policies will be made consistent across the two airlines. US Airways will exit the Star Alliance on March 30 and enter into the oneworld alliance on March 31.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel is willing to continue U.S-brokered peace talks with the Palestinians but ""not at any price,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday. Attempts by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to put peace talks back on track unraveled in the past week -- Israel reneged on a scheduled release of Palestinian prisoners, and the Palestinians responded by signing on to join 15 international bodies, reversing their commitment not to seek international recognition as a state. Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu blamed Palestinians for obstructing negotiations. ""The Palestinians substantially violated the understandings that were reached with American involvement,"" he said. Netanyahu said Israel would respond with steps of its own if the Palestinians pressed ahead with unilateral actions toward statehood. He did not elaborate. ""They will achieve a state only by direct negotiations, not by empty statements and not by unilateral moves,"" he said. ""These will only push a peace agreement farther away, and unilateral steps on their part will be met with unilateral steps on our part. We are ready to continue the talks but not at any price."" A senior foreign policy adviser for Fatah, the party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, said his party was not surprised by Netanyahu's remarks about statehood. ""If Netanyahu considers the Palestinians committing themselves to international law -- including committing themselves to empowering woman and protection of children -- is a provocation that calls for Israeli punishment, then what the Palestinians are saying all of these years have been proven beyond doubt that Israel considers international law to be hindrance for peace,"" Hussam Zomlot said. Last July, Kerry announced a bid to reach a peace deal within nine months. But as time rolled by with little progress, Kerry sought to get Netanyahu and Abbas to agree to a framework which would form the basis for a comprehensive peace treaty. With the deadline set to expire on April 29, Kerry and his aides have struggled to get the parties to extend the talks.","NEW: Palestinian official says Israel shouldn't object because they are following the law .

"(CNN) -- The Saudi Justice Ministry Tuesday issued a ""clarification"" of a court's handling of a rape case and the increased punishment -- including 200 lashes --meted out to the victim. The case, which has sparked media scrutiny of the Saudi legal system, centers on a married woman. The 19-year-old and an unrelated man were abducted, and she was raped by a group of seven men more than a year ago, according to Abdulrahman al-Lahim, the attorney who represented her in court. The woman was originally sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes. But that sentence was more than doubled to 200 lashes and six months in prison by the Qatif General Court, because she spoke to the media about the case, a court source told Middle Eastern daily newspaper Arab News. Al-Lahim told CNN his law license was revoked last week by a judge because he spoke to the Saudi-controlled media about the case.  Watch the emotional toll the crime took on the rape victim » . In a statement issued to CNN, Saudi Ambassador to the United States, Adel al-Jubeir said, ""This case is working its way through the legal process. I have no doubt that justice will prevail."" The Justice Ministry acknowledged in its statement Tuesday that the attorney is no longer on the case, saying he was punished by a disciplinary committee for lawyers because he ""exhibited disrespectful behavior toward the court, objected to the rule of law and showed ignorance concerning court instructions and regulations."" It added that the permanent committee of the Supreme Judicial Council recommended an increased sentence for the woman after further evidence against her came to light when she appealed her original sentence. The judges of that committee also increased the sentences for the perpetrators based on the level of their involvement in the crime. Their sentences -- which had been two to three years in prison -- were increased to two to nine years, according to al-Lahim. The ministry also said it welcomes constructive criticism and insisted that the parties' rights were preserved in the judicial process. ""We would like to state that the system has ensured them the right to object to the ruling and to request an appeal,"" the statement continued, ""without resorting to sensationalism through the media that may not be fair or may not grant anyone any rights, and instead may negatively affect all the other parties involved in the case."" The statement also described the progress of the woman's case and explained that it was heard by a panel of three judges, not one judge ""as mentioned in some media reports."" It said the case was treated normally through regular court procedures, and that the woman, her male companion and the perpetrators of the crime all agreed in court to the sentences handed down. In Washington, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said U.S. officials had ""expressed our astonishment"" at the sentence, though not directly to Saudi officials. ""It is within the power of the Saudi government to take a look at the verdict and change it,"" he added. White House homeland security adviser Frances Townsend, who announced her resignation Monday, called the case ""absolutely reprehensible"" but told CNN's ""American Morning"" the Saudis deserve credit for their assistance in battling terrorism. ""This case is separate and apart from that, and I just don't think there's any explaining it or justifying it,"" she added. The case has sparked outrage among human rights groups. ""This is not just about the Qatif girl, it's about every woman in Saudi Arabia,"" said Fawzeyah al-Oyouni, founding member of the newly formed Saudi Association for the Defense of Women's Rights. ""We're fearing for our lives and the lives of our sisters and our daughters and every Saudi woman out there. We're afraid of going out in the streets. ""Barring the lawyer from representing the victim in court is almost equivalent to the rape crime itself,"" she added. Human Rights Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah ""to immediately void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer."" The man and woman were attacked after they met in Qatif on the kingdom's Persian Gulf coast, so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him, according to al-Lahim. Citing phone records from the police investigation, al-Lahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client. He noted the photo she was trying to retrieve was harmless and did not show his client in any compromising position. Al-Lahim said the man tried to blame his client for insisting on meeting him that day. It is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under Saudi's Islamic law. Al-Lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Justice next month, where he faces a possible three-year suspension and disbarment, according to Human Rights Watch. He told CNN he has appealed to the Ministry of Justice to reinstate his law license and plans to meet with Justice Minister Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al Al-Sheikh. ""Currently she doesn't have a lawyer, and I feel they're doing this to isolate her and deprive her from her basic rights,"" he said. ""We will not accept this judgment and I'll do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place."" He said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the Saudi king earlier this month. ""The Ministry of Justice needs to have a very clear standing regarding this case because I consider this decision to be judiciary mutiny against the reform that King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz started and against Saudi women who are being victimized because of such decisions,"" he said. Under law in Saudi Arabia, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. Women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man, and they are not allowed to vote. The Saudi government recently has taken some steps toward bettering the situation of women in the kingdom, including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases, adoption of a new labor law that addresses working women's rights and creation of a human rights commission.

"Rome (CNN) -- Matteo Renzi was sworn in Saturday as Italy's youngest Prime Minister, alongside his new Cabinet of 16 ministers. It's a step many hope will bring much-needed political stability to the country. The former Florence mayor, who won control of the Democratic Party in a primary a couple of months ago, ousted fellow party member Enrico Letta in a party vote last week. Renzi, 39, is nicknamed il Rottomatore -- or ""the demolition man"" -- for his pugnacious style of politics. After the swearing-in ceremony at the presidential palace, he headed to the Italian Prime Minister's office, the Palazzo Chigi, to hold his first cabinet meeting. The lineup for Renzi's new government was published on his website Friday. Italy's new Finance Minister is Pier Carlo Padoan, currently deputy secretary-general and chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD.) Serving Interior Minister Angelino Alfano, of the Nouvo Centro Destra party, keeps his job in the new government. Half of Renzi's ministers are women, the largest proportion in Italian history. Most of the ministers are young by Italian standards, with an average age of 48. Renzi is expected to outline his new policies Monday in the Senate, where he will face a confidence vote. History of political turmoil . Letta held on to the top job in Italian politics for less than a year. He was sworn in last April at the head of a coalition government formed after months of uncertainty following inconclusive elections. But he was forced out last week amid frustration over the slow pace of reform. Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, has had more than its share of political turmoil over recent years. The last election to produce a leader was in 2008, when Silvio Berlusconi became Prime Minister for a third time. Since then, all the country's leaders have been appointed. Berlusconi, a billionaire tycoon who has dominated Italian politics for two decades, resigned in late 2011 after coming under pressure for Italy's economic woes. He was subsequently expelled from parliament after his conviction for tax fraud and can no longer run for office. READ MORE: Is Matteo Renzi ready to be Italy's PM?

"(CNN) -- Kit Skogsbergh can see it now. ""He would be a sidekick,"" she told me. ""He would have a soft and soothing voice. ... He would kind of be like Piglet in the Pooh movies because he would be a little cautious and scared of things, but once he knew the plan and how things worked he would warm up to it and maybe by the end of the movie he might not have to roll up into a ball (and hide). He'd be able to face things head on."" The 32-year-old from Pasadena, California, recently filed a petition on Change.org asking Disney to make an animated character out of a pangolin, a little-known, scale-covered mammal that's notoriously shy and, to Kit's point, can protect itself from pretty much anything in the wild -- lions, tigers -- by rolling up into a ball. The pangolin is being trafficked toward extinction -- sold for its scales, which are used in traditional medicine, and for its meat, which is a delicacy in Vietnam and China. Pangolins are traded by the ton. Disney could give the pangolin the celebrity it needs to survive. I'd encourage you to sign Kit's petition at Change.org. If people cared about the pangolin the way they care about tigers or elephants, it easily could be saved from extinction. The trouble: Few seem to realize these awesomely introverted animals exist. They're little studied and barely understood. They're also not conventionally cute, which makes it easier for conservation organizations and the public to write them off as expendable. Yet they are essential, valuable creatures. I recently went to Vietnam and Indonesia as part of CNN's Change the List project to document the massive illegal trade in endangered pangolin species. I hadn't heard of pangolins before readers voted for me to cover the illegal animal trade as part of that project; and Kit hadn't heard of them until she read the story last week. ""I got about halfway through (the story) and my stomach hurt so bad I couldn't finish it,"" Kit told me last week. ""I had this nagging feeling, you know, to do something about it."" Kit's petition -- titled ""Help beautiful and mysterious pangolins by featuring them in an animated movie!"" -- had 1,425 signatures as of Monday morning. At least 13 other readers also started petitions urging Disney to put a pangolin character in an animated film or short, according to Pulin Modi, a senior campaigner at Change.org. Disney and Disney Pixar have the reach to make the pangolin popular. And they don't have to do it out of the goodness of their hearts. It could be a hit. Pangolins are the ultimate underdog -- lovable and secretive, curious and little-known. Mother pangolins carry their babies around on their backs; pangolins hang from trees by their tails; and their tongues are longer than their bodies. Plus, Disney already has a choice of names. CNN readers are voting on a name for pangolin P26, which was rescued from the wildlife trade and was recently released back into the wild in Vietnam. Some of the names would be perfect for an animated character: Pemalu, which is Indonesian for ""shy""; Bao, Vietnamese for ""protection."" Or Percival, which is alliterative and fun. ""When you introduce a character in a Disney film the animal suddenly gets more recognition and people start talking about it,"" said Kit, who is a Disney fan. ""That education and awareness is what's going to help shape future generations' minds. Maybe we can start with younger people and they can grow up not wanting to eat the pangolin."" It might seem far-fetched that any Disney viewer would eat pangolin. But not for Kit, who is Chinese-American and who told me her father likely has consumed endangered wildlife products while doing business in China, possibly including pangolin. It's been a source of family conflict. ""It's like talking to a piece of cheese, you just don't get anywhere,"" she said of her conversations with her dad about the welfare of endangered animals. ""It's funny to him that people are concerned about what happens to an animal -- because it's just an animal, it's nothing more than that. It doesn't offer anything more than food or nourishment or medicinal properties. He laughs and says it makes you live longer or it makes your skin nice. And he'll say, 'You're crazy! You Americans!'"" She doesn't think she'll be able to persuade her dad to change, but younger generations may be the ones to save animals like pangolins and rhinos, she said. And Disney could reach them. Kit's own story is proof it could work. Kit was born in the United States, and she developed a fondness for animals when she was young. Her parents valued animals for their function -- Doom the Doberman's ability to protect their home, their ducks' eggs -- but she saw them as friends. ""Maybe I didn't have enough friends and the animals were always super friendly all the time,"" she said. ""I feel like it's pretty easy to make friends with animals."" She now has three cats -- Cheezburger, Monster and Ninja -- and a rabbit named Bunny. She became an advocate for animals because she got to know them. ""As a Chinese-American, I also want to speak up because the demand in China is helping drive the demand for pangolins to be killed for meat and medicines,"" she writes in the Change.org petition. ""I can tell you many Chinese citizens do not support this cruelty, and I believe we can bring wildlife advocates from around the world together to ask Disney to take this simple, fun, positive step to help pangolins."" ""It didn't cost me anything but half an hour of my time,"" she said of the petition. And it would take far less time to sign it.","More than 1,400 people sign a petition asking Disney to make a pangolin movie .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was discharged from a New York hospital on Wednesday, three days after she was admitted for treatment of a blood clot in a vein between her skull and brain, the State Department announced. ""Her medical team advised her that she is making good progress on all fronts, and they are confident she will make a full recovery,"" Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines said in a statement announcing her release. Clinton walked out of New York Presbyterian Hospital accompanied by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and daughter, Chelsea, for a brief period earlier Wednesday afternoon. The appearance led to speculation about her release, which was announced a couple hours later. She had been admitted Sunday, after doctors found the clot during a medical test related to a concussion she suffered in December. The secretary is being treated with blood thinners to dissolve the clot, which has not resulted in a stroke or any neurological damage. Doctors expect her to make a full recovery. Clinton's future 'as good as her past,' docs say . Earlier, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters that Clinton was in communication with aides and there was nothing new on her condition or treatment. Clinton ""has been quite active on the phone with all of us, but she also made some calls on Saturday to a couple of foreign officials,"" Nuland said. Those official calls came before the blood clot was disclosed Sunday. The first, to the joint special envoy on Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, lasted a half hour. The second was to the prime minister of Qatar, who is also the foreign minister. ""She has begun to pick up her regular phone contact with some of her counterparts,"" Nuland added. Clinton, 65, has not been publicly seen or heard from in more than three weeks since falling ill with severe stomach flu and a subsequent concussion that occurred when she fainted because of dehydration, officials said. Questions also have been raised as to why there was almost a day's delay in explaining the precise location of the clot and why she was administered an MRI, which revealed the problem. Nuland said officials have been ""extremely forthcoming"" about Clinton's health. Blood clots: 4 things you need to know . ""We will continue to keep you updated as we have new information to share, as we've been doing all along,"" Nuland said. ""I think that was eighth statement in some three weeks so please bear with us."" Asked how Clinton's illness might affect her plans to testify on Capitol Hill about the deadly September terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. Nuland did not directly say whether Clinton would appear. ""She has said that she is open to going up to the Hill. We are working with them now on their schedule because there's also a question of when they are going to be in and we will let you know when we have something to share,"" Nuland said. Clinton, a former first lady, New York senator and presidential candidate, does not plan to stay on for President Barack Obama's second term, but prefers to remain until her replacement is in place. Some senators have said they would delay confirmation hearings for her proposed successor, Sen. John Kerry, until Clinton has testified on the Libya attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.","Clinton is ""making good progress on all fronts"" and has been discharged .

"(CNN) -- A multistage operation is under way in the Pacific Ocean to bring a 1-year-old-girl who became seriously ill on a sailboat hundreds of miles off Mexico to shore for treatment, officials said Saturday. On Thursday morning, the U.S. Coast Guard received a distress call about the girl, who was on the Rebel Heart with her parents and a sibling about 900 miles off Mexico. According to their blogs, Eric Kaufman and his wife, Charlotte, had plans to cross the Pacific and had left Mexico two weeks ago with their daughters Cora and 1-year-old Lyra, reports CNN affiliate KGTV. The family lives in San Diego. Members of an Air National Guard unit operating out of Moffett Federal Airfield in the Bay Area were dispatched, according to a spokesman. Four members of the 129th Rescue Wing parachuted into the ocean, inflated a motorized boat and reached the 36-foot sailboat, said 2nd Lt. Roderick B. Bersamina. The child is in stable condition; the rescuers will stay with her until they reach a doctor, Bersamina said Saturday. Officials said they can't give details about the illness, but said, ""the family is in good spirits."" A Navy frigate will intercept the Rebel Heart some time Saturday. After meeting with the frigate, ""the pararescuemen and the family will be loaded on a helicopter, and they'll fly to the most appropriate medical facility,"" Bersamina said.

"(CNN) -- The peace of mind Paula Fisher sought for herself and her children when she left Pittsburgh nearly two decades ago was shattered outside Franklin Regional Middle School on Wednesday morning. ""It was total chaos,"" Fisher said. ""The kids weren't sure if they were supposed to stay in school or leave. They weren't letting anybody in and told us to stay back. There were ambulances running past us. I was able to see a lot of the parents that I know who have children in the high school."" The middle school sits across a field from the Pennsylvania high school where a stabbing spree injured 21 people, authorities said. A suspect, 16-year-old sophomore Alex Hribal, was taken into custody and arraigned Wednesday afternoon on charges of attempted homicide. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Seefeld said that before authorities arrived assistant principal Sam King was ""very admirable"" in tackling the suspect and holding him for authorities with the help of another assistant principal, Joan Mellon. Gov. Tom Corbett told reporters that there were ""a number of heroes in this day"" and ""many of them are students"" who stayed behind to help injured classmates. He said teachers, cafeteria workers, other staff members and school police officer William ""Buzz"" Yakshe -- who was injured but who handcuffed the suspect -- ensured that others made it out safely. ""This is obviously a very difficult day for this community,"" the governor said. Fisher, who has three children in the high school in addition to one in the middle school, was not surprised King was being praised for tackling the suspect. ""He's just a wonderful man,"" she said. ""He would do anything for your child. He would make sure he would get in touch with you if there were issues. He was very conscientious of what was happening within the friendships that they had. Just an all-around great guy."" She added, ""He would have done it for a stranger or a student or parent. But he was all about the kids so I am not surprised at all that he did try to get involved in stopping this."" Murrysville, with a population of about 20,000, is a quiet middle-class enclave roughly 20 miles east of Pittsburgh on U.S. Route 22. ""It was very shocking,"" said Fisher, who has lived in Murrysville 19 years. ""We are a tight-knit community. Everybody knows everybody. Even the doctor attending at the closest hospital is a neighbor of ours. Dr. (Mark) Rubino, he knows these children. Watching him, it touches home."" As she spoke on the phone to CNN, she said Rubino, chief medical officer at Forbes Regional Hospital in nearby Monroeville, was live on the television news, talking about the victims and stressing ""the critical nature of their injuries."" ""We are so small compared to other communities,"" Fisher said. ""We know each other. For myself, coming from the city of Pittsburgh, I came out here purposely to raise my children in a school district that we felt was safe as well as academically sound. It's a lot to take in right now."" At Dick's Diner in Murrysville, Deanna Tevelonis, a 1990 graduate of Franklin Regional Senior High School, said some parents were having breakfast after dropping off their children at school. ""They just kind of hung out until they got a hold of their children and made sure they were OK,"" she said. ""They had instructions not to go to the school. You could see the tension on their faces as they waited."" A message on the Franklin Regional School District's website said all of its elementary schools were closed after the incident, and ""the middle school and high school students are secure."" Franklin Regional Senior High will be closed ""over the next several days,"" district Superintendent Gennaro Piraino said. The district's middle school and elementary schools will be open Thursday, and counseling will be available for the whole district, he said. Fisher said she was running late getting her 13-year-old daughter to the middle school Wednesday morning. By the time they arrived, they had heard about the stabbings on the news. ""She didn't believe it,"" Fisher said of her daughter. ""She wanted to get down there as soon as possible. Once we got there, not knowing if her friends were OK, she started getting emotional."" Three of Fisher's four children attended Franklin Regional Senior High School, she said. One of her daughters graduated last year and is now a freshman at Kent State. ""You see stuff like this all the time on the news, but you don't know the people,"" she said. ""Here, we know quite a few of the families of the injured students."" At the Murrysville Spa, Roseann Markoff cried when she heard about what happened at the school attended by her nephews and nieces. She said she later learned that they were fine. ""It's heartbreaking,"" she said. ""It's a nice community. The people are very friendly and hard-working. It's so sad for everyone involved. Something has been taken away forever in your safe community.

"KINGSTON, Ontario (CNN)  -- For Shona Holmes, simple pleasures such as playing with her dog or walking in her plush garden are a gift. Canadian Shona Holmes, who had a brain tumor, sought medical care in the United States. After suffering from crushing headaches and vision problems, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor four years ago. She was told if it wasn't removed, she could go blind or even die. ""They said to me that you had a brain tumor and it was pressing on your optic chasm and that it needed to come out immediately,"" Holmes said. Holmes is Canadian, but the ""they"" she refers to are doctors at the Mayo Clinic in the United States, where she turned after specialists in her own government-run health care system would not see her fast enough. ""My family doctor at that time tried to get me in to see an endocrinologist and a neurologist,"" Holmes recalled. ""It was going to be four months for one specialist and six months for the other.""  Watch Holmes talk about her experience in getting treatment » . Even with the warning from U.S. doctors in hand, Holmes said she still couldn't get in to see Canadian specialists. Because the government system is the only health care option for Canadians, she says she had no choice but to have the surgery in the U.S. Her treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona cost $100,000, and she and her husband put a second mortgage on their home and borrowed from family and friends to pay for it. When she recounts that part of her painful story, she weeps. ""That's the stuff that I find so tragic -- having dinner with my friends and I know how much money I owe them,"" Holmes says, tears streaming down her face. With the health care reform debate raging in the U.S., Republicans in Washington are seizing on Holmes' story and other accounts from Canada to warn against government involvement in the health care system. The Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, asserted several times on the Senate floor last month that a government-run health insurance option, which President Obama and Democrats want, could lead to a government-controlled health care system like Canada's. Watch McConnell talk about Canada's health care system . McConnell singled out Kingston General Hospital in Ontario as a prime example of what Americans should be fearful of: staggering delays in treatment. CNN went to Kingston General and played a DVD for its chief of staff Dr. David Zelt of McConnell slamming the hospital. Zelt insists McConnell's numbers -- an average of 340 days wait time for knee replacements, 196 days for hip replacements -- are an exaggeration. ""I find it very frustrating that someone of that stature would not really have true knowledge of the numbers he is actually quoting on things,"" Zelt told us, saying the average wait time for a knee replacement is actually 109 days, and a hip replacement is 91 days.  Watch Zelt talk about Canada's health care system » . However, Zelt does concede that in Canada's system, where every Canadian citizen is covered, there are limited resources, shortages and often delays. ""In our health care system, we're looking at what we have to do to prioritize patients -- critically ill versus purely elective surgeries,"" Zelt said. ""I'm not going to say we don't have issues with timeliness for some things. It does happen. But again take the other side of the coin -- these patients have access. They're on somebody's waiting list if they have a problem, and I think the senator would need to look at that issue. Yes it may take time, but they will get seen."" McConnell's remarks have not only ruffled feathers with Ontario's doctors but also with government officials across the border. Canadian Sen. Hugh Segal, whom we met up with at Kingston's picturesque waterfront, says his ""fellow conservatives"" to the south are dead wrong about Canada's health care system. ""The notion that we have some bureaucrat standing next to every doctor between the patient and that doctor is a complete creation, there is no truth to that at all,"" Segal said.  Watch Canadian senator challenge McConnell's assertions » . ""What you have is a longer life span, better outcomes and about one-third less costs. That's what you have."" What Segal, Zelt and other Canadian officials underscore is that their government-run system is driven by the value of the care and that the quantity of tests and procedures don't necessarily equal quality. ""You can have a patient from the hospital with abdominal pain as an example, and you can run him through every high-tech equipment, CT scan, MRIs -- it's unlimited,"" Zelt said. ""But then you have to take a step back and look at that. What's the cost of doing those types of investigations, and what's the value really added to the patient?"" Despite Shona Holmes' horror story about her inability to get timely treatment for a brain tumor, Canadian officials and doctors insist most life-threatening cases are treated quickly. Toronto's Doug Wright can attest to that. The 40-year-old father of three young boys found out last month he has cancer -- a tumor on his leg. But he says he never had to wait more than five days to see a specialist or get a test. And from diagnosis to surgery, it will be just over a month. ""The community medical system thought this process could not have been any better. I have not had to wait to see some of the best specialists in the country, who are renowned internationally,"" Wright said.  Watch Wright talk about his treatment » . An investment adviser, Wright has the money to go to the U.S. for his care, but says there is no need. But Wright recognizes one reason he has gotten such a rapid response from Canadian doctors is because he has cancer. ""The bad news is I didn't have to wait for anything, because you don't have to wait when it's a serious issue,"" he said. Still, people can wait for months, or even years, for elective surgery. Wright's friend Rick Hession has a heart condition that could cause a stroke, but he has a three-month wait or more for an operation to help correct it. He says he can't exercise the way he would like to until he gets the surgery, but he's willing to wait. He calls it a small price to pay for free health coverage for all Canadians. ""I'm OK with it, and I think most people I talk to find they really are [willing to wait],"" says Hession.  Watch Hession talk about waiting for treatment » . The reality is that despite GOP rhetoric to the contrary, no Democratic plan now on the table calls for a Canadian-like government run health care system. But in talking to doctors, government officials and even average Canadians, they concede their system is far from perfect, but there is one statistic they are quite proud of: All Canadians have health coverage. That's 33 million people, compared with the 47 million uninsured in the U.S.","Woman with tumor said wait would have been too long; she got costly U.S. treatment .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Washington Monument, which is slated for repairs after it was damaged in an earthquake last year, appears to be sinking, according to preliminary data collected by the National Geodetic Survey. NGS surveyors and the National Park Service are investigating whether the August 23, 2011, earthquake caused the 555-foot stone obelisk to sink or shift. ""Our initial observations show a difference of around 2 millimeters at several of the survey markers in the vicinity of the monument,"" Chief Geodetic Surveyor Dave Doyle told CNN. The Washington Monument was last surveyed in 2009. Since its completion in 1884, data shows it has sunk nearly 2 inches. The monument, the tallest structure in the nation's capital, has been closed since the magnitude 5.8 quake struck the mid-Atlantic region near Richmond, Virginia. The earthquake may be responsible for the monument to have sunk 1 millimeter, while the other millimeter may be a result of normal settling, according to Doyle. ""It will still take some time to apply the proper corrections for atmospheric conditions ... to this data and perform a full analysis once the entire survey is completed -- hopefully by the end of next week,"" Doyle said. The National Geodetic Survey is expanding the scope of its study to determine whether other national monuments are slipping back into the swampland upon which the nation's capital was built. ""The survey plans are being expanded to include observations around the tidal basin to the Jefferson Memorial and Lincoln Memorial, as well as other areas along the National Mall, including the Smithsonian Institution's Castle building, the U.S. Capitol, and eastward to Union Station,"" an NGS statement said. Experts are still trying to figure out the best way to address damage found both inside and along the exterior of the Washington Monument, including whether an outside scaffold will be needed. Last fall, structural engineers documenting the impact of the earthquake used a system of ropes and slings to scale all four faces of the structure from top to bottom. David Rubenstein, co-founder of the investment firm The Carlyle Group, has donated $7.5 million toward the repair project. With Rubenstein's donation and congressional funds that were approved in December, Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes said in January there was enough money to begin the repairs. The project should start this summer or early fall, and should take about a year, Hayes said.","The Washington Monument suffered cracks in August's earthquake .

"(CNN) -- The State Department on Wednesday designated Nigeria-based Boko Haram and its offshoot Ansaru as ""terrorist organizations,"" legally enabling Washington to take various steps against the groups, their members and their supporters. The two groups join a list of ""Foreign Terrorist Organizations"" that includes al Qaeda, Hamas, the Real Irish Republican Army and many others. Being so named means the United States can freeze such organizations' assets, impose travel bans on their known members and affiliates, and prohibit Americans from offering material support. U.S. officials told CNN Tuesday this move was coming against both organizations, who have been in the news in recent years for various attacks. The United States says Boko Haram has killed thousands since 2009. Human rights groups put the figure at more than 3,000. Boko Haram, which means ""Western education is sacrilege"" in the Hausa-Fulani language, has launched a self-described ""war on Christians"" and seeks to impose a strict version of Sharia law across northeastern Nigeria, if not the entire country. It has attacked various targets in the West African nation since its formation in the late 1990s, according to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center. This includes killing and kidnapping Westerners, and bombing schools, churches and mosques, the center said. In August, militants allegedly went into a mosque in Borno state and killed 44 worshipers. The group released a video boasting it was growing stronger and had launched attacks in Benisheikh in September that the State Department said left 160 civilians dead, many of them Muslim women and children. In recent months, it has stepped up attacks against students at English-language schools. In September, the State Department said Boko Haram attacked an agricultural school, killing 50 students in their dorm as they slept. Earlier this month, the United Nations warned that the extremist group could be found guilty of crimes against humanity after it launched a brutal attack on a wedding party that killed more than 30 people. The U.N. refugee agencies estimates more than 8,000 people in Nigeria have fled into neighboring Cameroon to escape the escalating violence and another 5,000 have become internally displaced. While the group's principal focus is Nigeria, the United States cites links to the al Qaeda affiliate in West Africa, and extremist groups in Mali. Gen. Carter Ham, then the commander of U.S. Africa Command, has warned Congress that Boko Haram elements ""aspire to a broader regional level of attacks,"" including against United States and European interests. A Boko Haram suicide attack on the United Nations building two years ago in the Nigerian capital of Abuja killed at least 25 people. In June 2012, the State Department added several of the group's members to a terrorist blacklist, including its new leader Abubakar Shekau, who has a $7 million bounty on his head. As to Ansaru, it has gone after Nigerian military and Western targets, according to the State Department. This includes a November 2012 raid on a police station in Abuja that killed Nigerian police officers and sprung free several terrorists. The State Department also blames Ansaru for kidnapping foreigners who live and work in the African nation plus attacking a convoy of Nigerian peacekeepers. The decision to designate Boko Haram and Ansaru as terrorist organizations followed a robust debate. The administration faced intense pressure from Congress and some officials to list the groups, given their history of violence. Other officials and experts warned they did not pose a threat to the United States, adding that designating them as terrorist organizations could make Washington more of a target. And some officials argued the Nigerian government could interpret the decision as an American green light to continue its heavy-handed crackdown on the organization. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan stepped up a military campaign against the group six months ago, declaring a six-month state of emergency in May in the three northeastern states worst hit by the violence. Recent Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reports accused the Nigerian military of human rights abuses and violations when conducting operations against the group. The U.N. said it is investigating the claims. The State Department hinted at this issue in its announcement designating Boko Haram and Ansaru as terrorist groups. ""All of our assistance to Nigeria stresses the importance of protecting civilians and ensuring that human rights are respected,"" the State Department said. ""That assistance and these designations demonstrate U.S. support for the Nigerian people's fight against Boko Haram and Ansaru.""","Boko Haram, Ansaru designated as terrorist organizations by the U.S.

"London (CNN) -- In five years time, all new homes built in the UK will be required to be zero carbon, with no net carbon emissions over a year. CNN spoke to green house-builders and environmentalists to answer some burning questions about zero carbon homes. Why do we need zero carbon homes? Some 26% of UK's carbon emissions come from homes, making it a significant area for reducing emissions overall, according to UK Green Building Council and WWF. Neil Jefferson, of the Zero Carbon Hub, the agency set up by the British government to help achieve its target, said an average home built in 2006 emits 3.2 tons of carbon a year and a typical 100-year-old home emits about six tons. By 2016, all new homes will have zero carbon emissions over a year. This will be a minimum requirement for homes to gain planning permission. Of course, most people will not be living in new houses, so existing homes will also need to be made more energy efficient, according to Zoe Leader, sustainable homes policy adviser for WWF. The UK aims to build somewhere in the region of 200,000 new homes a year, a drop in the ocean compared to more than 22 million existing homes. Quiz: Do you live a sustainable life? What exactly does zero carbon mean? Zero carbon homes will have no net carbon emissions over the course of a year. Energy use will be minimized by use of thermally efficient building materials and insulation. All the energy used to heat and light the home and run its appliances will need to be off-set using zero carbon technology such as wind turbines, solar panels and ground source heat pumps. When the target was originally set in 2006, it was envisaged that all this renewable energy would be generated onsite, according to Jefferson. However, following a report in 2008, which took in views from industry and green groups, it was decided that to be realistic, the definition needed to be relaxed to allow contributions to off-site renewable energy schemes. This would allow house-builders to make payments into new community energy schemes to off-set the carbon emissions of their homes. The exact definition of these ""allowable solutions"" as the off-site schemes are known, is still being worked out. Leader, of WWF, said: ""We need to make sure these allowable solutions are truly additional, and not things that would have happened anyway."" The UK has a Code for Sustainable Homes, where the highest level 6 is zero carbon. Regulations will require homes to move gradually up the scale before 2016. How does the UK's target compare with others worldwide? Jefferson, of the Zero Carbon Hub, said: ""The target is without doubt the most challenging in the world."" Many believe that while countries such as Germany, Sweden and China have already produced more zero carbon homes than the UK, nowhere else can rival its ambitious target for 2016. John Alker, director of policy and communications at UK Green Building Council, an industry body liaising with the government over green issues, said: ""This country's target is world-leading, not on what we have delivered so far, but in ambition. ""EU legislation is leading towards zero carbon building, but the UK is ahead of the picture in having such an ambitious target. Germany and Scandinavia have historically had better building standards and some countries have decided to tackle the commercial building stock first."" Leader agreed: ""There are pockets of sustainable developments such as Freiburg in Germany and Malmo in Sweden, but nowhere else has a far-reaching policy like this. ""EU legislation is heading toward zero carbon building by 2020."" However, Bill Dunster, an architect who founded ZED Factory, based in the UK and China, and has built between 300 and 500 zero carbon homes worldwide, said: ""There's very little demand in the UK compared with Germany and China, who are both far more ambitious and innovative."" How many zero carbon homes have been built so far? Very few. In 2007 the UK government announced tax relief on zero carbon homes and so far only about 25 homes have qualified, according to Alker, of the UK Green Building Council. However, this tax relief was based on the definition that all off-set energy had to be produced onsite, a definition which has since been considered unrealistic. Alker added: ""This is a future policy and standards are ramping up between now and 2016. There's not a huge incentive to go out and do it now."" Dunster, who founded ZED Factory in 1998, said: ""Despite what all the volume house builders are saying, it's not difficult if you want to do it. We are just getting on with it."" He added: ""In the UK, we are doing small-scale privately funded developments, whereas in China we are being asked to design whole city extensions with thousands of homes.""","UK regulations will require all new homes to have zero net carbon emissions by 2016 .
These are the most ambitious targets in the world, according to experts .

"(CNN) -- The Oklahoma man who died after police wrestled him to the ground in a movie theater parking lot two weeks ago was acting aggressively, according to a police report released this week. Luis Rodriguez's wife, Nair Rodriguez, has accused police of brutality in the incident, part of which she recorded on her cell phone at the Warren Theater in Moore, Oklahoma. The video shows five police officers on top of Rodriguez, who appears to lie still for most of the recording. Throughout the video, Nair Rodriguez worriedly calls out to her husband and begs for information about his condition. ""Please somebody tell me that he is alive,"" she implores. ""He is not moving."" The February 15 incident began when a bystander told police she had witnessed a domestic fight in the movie theater parking lot. Nair Rodriguez had slapped her 19-year-old daughter during an argument, she would later tell police. According to the report, Luis Rodriguez refused to provide police with identification, stepped back, crossed his arms and repeatedly tried to walk around them. When they asked for identification one final time, one of the officers said Rodriguez ""got into what he interpreted as a fighting stance where he was 'bladed' or 'squared off' to them."" Officers struggled to get handcuffs on Rodriguez, fell to the ground with him and finally used ""several compliance techniques"" to get him under control, according to the report. The report does not list the techniques, but Moore Police Chief Jerry Stillings earlier told CNN affiliate KOCO that pepper spray had been used. The Rodriguez family said police also hit Luis Rodriguez in the head, according to KOCO. He stopped breathing in the ambulance and again at the hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to the report. Three Moore police officers involved in the incident have been placed on paid administrative leave pending further investigation. Two Oklahoma game wardens who also helped subdue Rodriquez are continuing with their normal duties. Stillings has said the actions of his officers appeared to be reasonable.","Police report indicates man who died after police scuffle seemed aggressive .

"(CNN) -- NATO's chief urged Russia on Friday to pull back its troops from its border with Ukraine. Russia should contribute ""to a de-escalation of the situation"" and engage in a direct dialogue with the Ukrainian government, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said during a visit to Sofia, Bulgaria. NATO is ""not discussing military actions"" but is focused on protecting its allies, and it ""will take all steps necessary to make sure that this collective defense is effective,"" Rasmussen said. Meanwhile, the organization is reinforcing support to its allies, ""from the Baltic to the Black Sea,"" to deal with the instability created by Russia, Rasmussen said via Twitter. NATO released additional satellite images Friday purportedly showing the Russian military buildup and rebutted Russian claims that other satellite photos released a day earlier were outdated. NATO said the photos were recent, gathered between late March and earlier this month. ""It is clear that the military buildup of forces occurred in early March 2014,"" NATO said. Meanwhile, the destroyer USS Donald Cook has entered the Black Sea on a mission to demonstrate the U.S. ""commitment to our allies and to enhance security readiness in the region,"" Navy spokesman Lt. Shawn P. Eklund said Friday. Russia has called the U.S. military move, however, part of a systemic NATO buildup in the Black Sea. An international crisis arose in Ukraine after Russia annexed its Crimean Peninsula in March under a pact signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin with the Prime Minister of Crimea and the mayor of the city of Sevastopol. Earlier, in a Crimean referendum, 96.7% of ballots favored Crimea leaving Ukraine and being annexed by Russia. The United States now estimates there are up to 40,000 Russian troops near the border, based on classified and commercial satellite imagery. Russia has no intention to additionally annex the southeastern regions of Ukraine, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday in a televised interview on Russian state television, the state-run ITAR-Tass news agency reported. ""This would run counter to the vital interests of Russia,"" Lavrov said, while adding that there is no need to deploy peacekeepers in Ukraine nor any need for United Nations Security Council decisions on the matter. Lavrov went on to say that there are no Russian troops or Russian secret services agents in southeastern Ukraine.

"Lake Turkana, Kenya (CNN) -- Richard Leakey has spent a lifetime exploring Kenya's Turkana Basin searching for the origins of man. Each layer of sediment, says the paleoanthropologist and founder of the Turkana Basin Institute, helps to tell the narrative of human evolution. ""You get the whole story of life represented going back from the present right back to the beginnings of an ape that has two legs as opposed to four,"" Leakey said. ""So the whole story of humanity you can actually trace to the Turkana Basin."" But Leakey says these ancient hills tell another story, a history of climactic changes that gave rise to some species and led to the extinction of others. With climate change, he says, this history could be repeated. ""The future of humanity is not going to be in the sediments, it is going to be in our minds and our thinking and unfortunately what we find here is that evidence,"" Leakey said. ""What we find here that is scientifically provable, immutable facts doesn't necessarily get absorbed for the moment by the political class who simply don't want to know the ugly truth that the world is a mess."" On the shores of Lake Turkana -- the largest desert lake in the world -- they don't need to know the science of climate change. For more than 1,000 years, fishermen have been bringing in their catch, but, in less than a generation, they have witnessed disturbing changes. ""When I was young this lake was full, says Lazarao Maraka, a local fisherman. ""The water just keeps going down. We used to get big fish every day, now they are tiny."" Maraka has reason to worry. Sometimes it is hard to see the effects of climate change, but not at Lake Turkana. Global human impact on Earth . Thirty years ago the area was covered with water. Now, it is just sand and gravel. And scientists believe that in just a few decades it will be reduced to a couple of puddles. Upriver dam projects could further hasten the retreat, a potential catastrophe for the entire region that depends on the lake for food and economic survival. ""I think the prospect of many of these half million people living around the lake today of having to relocate to cities and to slums and to abandon their culture, abandon their ancestral land, become paupers in their own land, I think it is very real,"" Leakey says. ""I think the way of life is gone...I have no doubt about that at all. I think if you came back here or my grandchildren came back in 50 years we wouldn't recognize what we are talking about today."" Leakey's Turkana Basin Institute is trying to understand how climate change is affecting the Turkana. More: Could big cities lead fight against climate change? Sometimes the best thing to do is listen. The Turkana say the rains are less frequent and the droughts come more often. The unpredictable weather and vanishing pasture has decimated their herds. Climate change does affect the Turkana people, says Ikal Angelei from the Turkana Basin Institute. ""With the increase of drought it has made the communities unable to adapt to the changes, because it happens so often,"" Angelei said. Leakey says that anyone skeptical about climate change should visit the Turkana Basin. ""Coming to a place like this, I think you actually show people what happens. These are real issues that you can see and feel and almost touch that may make people understand that we are on the edge of a precipice and we are going over,"" he said. ""We have accelerated a process and it is based on the belief that somehow we can maintain control. I think our carbon dioxide emissions are out of control."" Even with the changes around Lake Turkana, fishermen like Lazaro Maraka still try to eke out a living the only way they know how. He worries what will be left for his son Eroo if the lake continues to recede. ""If there is no lake or no fish, then the people will not survive around this lake. This lake is the Turkana's life,"" Maraka says. This place has helped unlock humanity's past. Today, it could also be providing a window on its future.","Conservationist Richard Leakey has been working in Kenya's Turkana Basin for years .

It was the first time he has spoken in public about Steenkamp's death, which he says was an accident. He pleaded not guilty to murder when the high-profile trial opened last month. Steenkamp's mother, June, sat stony-faced in court as South Africa's onetime Olympic golden boy choked out his statement. Judge Thokozile Masipa also betrayed no emotion as Pistorius spoke but did once ask him to talk louder, saying she could hardly hear him. Monday was the first day of the defense phase of the trial, following three weeks of prosecution in March. Pistorius, who says he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder in his house in the dark, testified that he has been suffering nightmares since the killing and wakes up smelling blood. He told the Pretoria court that he is afraid to sleep, and ""if I hear noise, I wake up just in a complete state of terror."" He said he is on medication, including an antidepressant and sleeping aids. Earlier, the first defense witness, pathologist Jan Botha, talked about the wounds Steenkamp suffered when Pistorius shot her and about when she last ate. The South African amputee sprinter put his head in his hands as Botha said that the shot that hit Steenkamp's arm was ""akin to a traumatic amputation"" and that she died ""fairly quickly after sustaining the head wound."" Botha went first because of ""family health reasons,"" Roux said, breaking with the South African legal custom of the defendant testifying first. He said Botha was the only defense witness who will go ""out of order."" Childhood remembered . Pistorius, 27, is accused of intentionally murdering Steenkamp, 29. The defense team will call 14 to 17 witnesses, Barry Roux, Pistorius' lead lawyer, said as he opened his case. The prosecution rested its case on March 25 after 15 days and 21 witnesses. Oscar Pistorius on trial: Explore each side's case . Pistorius took the stand late Monday morning after the pathologist finished his testimony. Roux spent much of the day trying to build up a picture of Pistorius as a dedicated athlete, responsible person and devoted Christian who was ""bowled over"" by his love for Steenkamp. Pistorius was also prompted to talk about his awareness of crime, including having come to the aid of victims of crime. Talking about his childhood, Pistorius said his mother kept a firearm in a padded bag under her pillow. His father was often not around, and Pistorius said his mother would sometimes wake her children up, thinking they were being burgled. He said she was very supportive of him and ""never made me feel any different from the rest of the kids."" ""Everything I learned in life, I learned from her,"" he said. He spoke about her death when he was 15 and attending boarding school. He did not know she was sick until he got a call asking him to come visit her at a hospital, he said. Later, he got a call from doctors telling him to come immediately and arrived when she was on her deathbed. She died 10 minutes after he arrived, Pistorius testified. She had encouraged him to be a normal child and participate in sports despite his disability, he said. Roux took him through his athletic triumphs, including his success as a Paralympic sprinter, but also highlighted times he felt vulnerable or afraid. He was badly injured in a boating accident in 2009, he said, which left him ""a lot more vigilant about losing my life ... more fearful."" And he said he cannot stand still without his prosthetics on. ""I don't have balance on my stumps,"" he said. ""I can't stand still on my stumps."" That could be a key to his defense. He says he fired his gun because he would have been unable to defend himself or run away when he heard what he thought was a burglar. Roux asked for court to adjourn for the day about 20 minutes early after Pistorius testified that he did not sleep the previous night. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel seemed to be on the verge of objecting when Masipa intervened, saying, ""He does look exhausted."" The trial is due to resume Tuesday morning. Trial to last until mid-May . Pistorius admits that he killed Steenkamp, firing four shots through a closed door in his house in the early hours of February 14, 2013. Three hit her, with the last one probably killing her almost instantly, according to the pathologist who performed the autopsy. But Pistorius says he thought she was a nighttime intruder in his pitch-black house and believed he was firing in self-defense. The trial, which began on March 3, is scheduled to continue until the middle of May. Pistorius first achieved global fame as an outstanding double-amputee sprinter who ran with special prostheses that earned him the nickname ""Blade Runner."" Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years in prison. Pistorius also could get five years for each of two unrelated gun indictments and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence. The sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge's discretion. Reeva to Oscar Pistorius: 'I'm scared of you sometimes' Gory details lend Oscar Pistorius trial a 'CSI' flavor .

"(CNN) -- French photographer Francois Beaurain knew virtually nothing of Monrovia when he followed his girlfriend, a humanitarian worker, to the Liberian capital. ""I was not even able to put Monrovia or Liberia on a map. So, like everybody, I started to Google it,"" he confesses. The search results did not paint a pretty picture of the country: images that popped up were mainly of civil war, blood diamonds, and child soldiers. ""It looks like a nightmare, like hell on earth. It's a very bad marketing job,"" says Beaurain. When he arrived, he admits he was ""not scared, but worried,"" though he soon found the city was a much friendlier place than Google let on. ""I quickly realized it's really rather nice,"" he says. ""It's one of the safest countries in Africa. There's a big discrepancy between what is really the country and its image internationally."" Addressing this disparity, Beaurain launched Monrovia Animated, a series of GIFs that aims to capture the city's lighter side. Though the settings in some of these looped animations show the scars of Liberia's civil war (the once five-star Ducor Intercontinental Hotel, which today stands empty, is a regular backdrop), Beaurain's films also feature smiling, upbeat locals. ""I don't always have a plan. A lot of the time, I go around the city and meet people. It's just about having fun and creating some magic,"" he says. Though many of the city's residents recognize him now, he admits that finding subjects had its challenges in the beginning, particularly because most assumed he was a foreign reporter looking to exploit their image. ""The moment they see you have a camera, they think you're a journalist and will bring the photo back to America to make money from it,"" he says. To put his subjects at ease, Beaurain made a point of returning with the GIF on a smartphone, both to prove that the image would stay in Liberia, and to demonstrate his concept. ""They don't always understand that day why I want them to run, but if they don't get it on the spot, they get it a few days later when I come back with the phone."" The digital format also appeals to Beaurain, partly because he finds Africa is underrepresented, both as a theme in digital art, and as a source of it. For Beaurain, an important aspect of the project is showing that Liberia is capable of creating powerful, thought-provoking digital works. Since moving to Monrovia, the local culture has inspired a number of other projects, too, including collages made from Nollywood posters and sculptures made from decommissioned AK-47s from the country's civil war. Mainly, though, Beaurain wants to update the version of Liberia currently making the rounds on the internet. ""Honestly, the goal of this is that maybe in a few months, or a few years, when people stop to Google Liberia or Monrovia, they will find my GIFs, instead of images of child soldiers,"" he says. ""Maybe it's a little bit ambitious, but that's the target.""","Photographer creates GIFs of Monrovia, in Liberia .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho is the king of football gamesmanship, but his constant declarations that Chelsea's English Premier League lead is ""fake"" appear to be becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Saturday's controversial defeat at Aston Villa allowed Manchester City to close to within six points, with three games in hand on the London club and a vastly superior goal difference. City bounced back from the midweek European Champions League exit in Barcelona by winning 2-0 at Hull, despite having influential captain Vincent Kompany sent off in just the 10th minute. Mourinho was also sent to the stands at Villa Park, following second-half red cards to Chelsea midfielders Willian and Ramires. Willian's second booking seemed harsh, but -- after Fabian Delph put Villa ahead with a delightful backheel flick -- his fellow Brazilian deserved to go after a vicious tackle on Karim El Ahmadi. Referee Chris Foy has now issued six red cards to Chelsea players in the last eight of the club's matches in which he has officiated -- and Mourinho was fighting to keep his feelings hidden afterwards in fear of being punished by the authorities. ""I prefer not to speak about the decisions. If I speak I am in big trouble,"" he said after his team's 14-match unbeaten run was ended by a Villa side that moved up to 10th place. ""The referees do what they do. They go home and they don't talk to the press, and they refuse even to exchange a couple of words, when one person like me -- that is in football for so long -- asks politely, 'Can you speak with me for five seconds?' ""I ask five seconds to make one simple question and I had no chance because I was sent to the stands. ""It's difficult to close the mouth, it's very difficult but I have to do it because I don't want to bring the game into disrepute."" Manchester City moved up to second place, but Liverpool and Arsenal could trim Chelsea's lead to four points on Sunday with victories in crunch clashes against rivals Manchester United and Tottenham respectively. It was a difficult start to a big week for Chelsea, whose European Champions League hopes will be tested by Tuesday's visit of Galatasaray ahead of next weekend's home clash with Arsenal. City host the EPL's bottom team Fulham next Saturday ahead of the Manchester derby at Old Trafford and a trip to Arsenal. ""I think it was a very good response from the team. It was a very difficult week,"" City boss Manuel Pellegrini said of his team's win after Kompany was dismissed for bringing down Nikica Jelavic. ""I thought before it was clear foul by Jelavic before Vincent did his foul -- but the referee didn't see it, he saw the foul of Kompany and he sent him off."" Everton closed to within two points of fifth-placed Tottenham with a 2-1 win at home to second-bottom Cardiff, and Roberto Martinez's team have a game in hand on the Londoners. Southampton moved up to eighth with a 4-2 win over Norwich, while Newcastle dropped down after losing 1-0 at Fulham. Stoke joined Villa on 34 points with a 3-1 win at home to West Ham, as former Nigeria striker Peter Odemwingie scored twice. Sunderland stayed in the bottom three after drawing 0-0 with fellow strugglers Crystal Palace, but West Brom moved three points away from the relegation zone by winning 2-1 at Swansea. The previous day West Brom sacked Nicolas Anelka after the former France international said he had terminated his own contract in reaction to the club's response to his fine and ban for performing a controversial ""quenelle"" gesture during a match in December.","Jose Mourinho sent off along with two Chelsea players in 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa .

"(CNN) -- I can vividly recall watching my first Olympic Games. Lying on the floor of the Boise, Idaho, home I grew up in, I tuned in each evening to the 1992 Barcelona Games. I remember the moment when the athletes entered the stadium during the Opening Ceremonies. As I saw Team USA walk in, everyone dressed in stunning outfits, proudly waving our flag, I felt a sense of national pride that I had never known before. I was 9 at the time and completely enchanted by the magic of the Olympic Games. In a world full of politics and war, here was a moment where everyone could set aside their differences and instead battle on the playing field for the love of competition and national pride. In an ideal world this is what the Olympic Games should always be about. However, we do not live in an ideal world. Rather, we live in an imperfect one where something as simple and beautiful as loving someone can get you thrown to the streets or put in jail or even murdered. For this reason, as much as I am excited to see the incredible athletic contests at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia, I am also paying close attention to the political theater that will play out there. People from around the world will be watching. We should use this opportunity to insist that Russia change its discriminatory laws against gay people. In the summer of 2013, I had the distinct pleasure of representing the U.S. at the World Championships for Track and Field in Moscow. While there, I finished second in the 800 meters, and subsequently dedicated my medal to the gay community. This received much international media attention due to the fact that I was one of the first athletes to openly criticize Russia's anti-gay propaganda laws on Russian soil. Though I was one of the first, I will certainly not be the last. As the Winter Olympics unfold, I am confident that we will see many Olympians from around the world protest these antiquated and discriminatory laws. The Russian government will be faced with two choices: Ignore those that break the law and face ridicule from its own people, or enforce its laws by punishing the lawbreakers and challenge the International Olympic Committee to enforce its own charter. Principle 6 of the IOC charter states that any form of discrimination, including sexual orientation, is incompatible with the Olympics. When the IOC awarded Russia the 2014 Winter Olympics, Russia had not yet passed their discriminatory laws. With the laws now firmly in place, the IOC has a responsibility to the international community to make sure that its charter is upheld or risk putting the Olympic movement's credibility at stake. As an athlete, I understand how hard the Olympic athletes have trained for the last four years. They deserve the chance to compete against the world's best at the highest level. However, their right to compete must not come at the expense of basic human rights. I encourage the athletes to remember why they are in Sochi and what their primary job is. But I am confident that many of these Olympians and their fans will also bring up the issue. We will probably see different forms of protest throughout the Olympic Games. And should Russia decide to enforce its discriminatory laws, the IOC must ultimately be held responsible. I ask that you join me in keeping the IOC accountable and demanding that it upholds its own charter. Recently, two nonprofits, Athlete Ally and All Out, joined forces to create the Principle 6 campaign, which includes a petition calling for Russia to put an end to its discriminatory laws. The website contains information that can be shared via social media to remind people that sport does not and should not discriminate on the ground of race, religion, gender, politics, or sexual orientation. As always, I am eagerly counting down the days to the beginning of the next Olympic Games. We are sure to witness some of the finest displays of athletic brilliance the world has ever seen. In both the triumphs and defeats, let us allow these Games to bring us together as citizens of the world. Let us show support and thanks to the host nation, while at the same time holding it to the standards and responsibility that comes with the honor of hosting such a world-class event. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nick Symmonds.","Nick Symmonds: Olympians could raise issue of Russia's anti-gay laws .

"(CNN) -- You've probably seen the ad campaign encouraging you to take 10 minutes to answer 10 questions and fill out your census form. The Census Bureau wants everyone to put their completed forms in the mail by April 1, National Census Day. This year's questionnaire is one of the shortest in history, but the results of the survey have long-term effects. Haven't sent yours in yet? Lost your form? Here's what you need to know: . What happens if I don't turn in my form? If you do not return it, a replacement form will be sent. Some hard-to-count areas will automatically receive a second questionnaire. In addition, you may get a knock at your door from a census-taker between May 1-July 10. There are also legal ramifications: Under the law, it is a crime to not answer the census and courts can impose a fine of up to $5,000 for not responding. But the bureau says it will use that as the last resort. I never got a form. What should I do? Your form should have arrived by mid-March. If not, call the Telephone Questionnaire Assistance Center at 1-866-872-6868, from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. seven days a week through the end of July. Those who are hearing impaired are able to utilize TDD 1-866-783-2010. For information on assistance in languages other than English, click here. Census Day is not a deadline, so you'll still be able to send in your information after that date. What do I do if I lost my form? You can either wait for a replacement form, call the information line or visit a Be Counted location to fill out the form. After April 12, you'll be able to call and request a phone interview in place of filling out the form, a Census Bureau spokeswoman said. I sent in my information. What happens next? The Census Bureau will sift through your information and record the answers into its database. By law, it has until December 2010 to give population statistics to President Obama and until March 2011 to deliver information to the states. Have a complaint?

Anyone caught disclosing information faces a fine of up to $250,000, up to a five-year prison sentence, or both. Why is it important to fill out the census form? The census, taken every 10 years, is used to determine how to allocate more than $400 billion in federal funds and how to allocate seats in the House of Representatives. ""There is no representative democracy without it.

"(CNN) -- As police tell it, he called himself ""Scott"" and showed up with $150 at the ready. He was drawn to a house on the outskirts of Minneapolis by an online ad that promised a ""no limit experience"" with the catchy tagline, ""Sick of winter? Come see how Sommer feels."" Within minutes, he'd been cuffed, read his rights and cited for engaging in prostitution by undercover detectives in Coon Rapids, Minnesota. He was one of nearly a dozen men arrested as part of a sting operation, and exercised his right to remain silent, according to police reports. ""Scott"" turned out to be Steven Smith, a fellow cop -- in fact, the police chief of the Minneapolis suburb of Robbinsdale. Officers learned his real name the night of his arrest on February 20, but only discovered his law enforcement role when preparing documents for his lawyer last week, Coon Rapids Police Chief Brad Wise said. ""It was at that time that a staff member recognized Smith's photo as that of the Robbinsdale police chief,"" Wise said in a written statement. Smith was released after booking on the misdemeanor charge and has since resigned his post, CNN affiliate WCCO reported. His lawyer, Paul Sarratori, declined comment Tuesday. Wise said nothing Smith carried at the time of his arrest identified him as a law enforcement officer. ""Mr. Smith did not ask for special treatment upon his arrest, nor did he receive treatment different from any other person arrested in this operation,"" Wise said.

"(CNN) -- In many ways, my life is ordinary and extraordinary at the same time. I am a working mother with three young children ages 2, 4 and 6. I got them dressed today. We fought over wearing hats because it was cold outside. I packed their snacks. I dropped them off and kissed their chubby cheeks. I am the PTA treasurer for my daughter's school. I am a volunteer in the community. I am a wife to a partner I have been with nearly 14 years. I live in a suburb. I have all the trappings of a comfortable life. I am content in my daily life. What sets me apart from the typical soccer mom is that I am an outspoken recovering heroin addict. Many people might be familiar with my story from the movie ""Black Tar Heroin: The Dark End of the Street."" I agreed to be featured in the film because I thought it would live on after I died from an overdose as a testimonial to the dangers of drug addiction. Yet I survived eight years of heroin addiction. I was one of the lucky few from that time period when treatment options and evidence-based treatment solutions were limited. I started my journey as a heroin addict while a college student in Cincinnati. I had been given Vicodin after removal of my wisdom teeth. I fell in love with that feeling opiates provided me. My burdens seemed to slip away under the influence. I longed for that feeling. After experimenting with many drugs, I found opiates provided me with the ability to forget my problems. No longer was I obsessed with feeling different. I was happy with being numb. My addiction quickly spiraled until I ended up being a homeless junkie in the streets of San Francisco's Tenderloin district. At first I was doing the drugs, but in short order the drugs began to control every aspect of my life. I was living on the streets and in and out of rat-infested hotels. In a few short years, I was completely unrecognizable as my former self. My last day using was February 26, 1998. I was injecting heroin into the soles of my feet because I no longer had any usable veins. I could barely walk, I was emaciated, and I was relieved when I was arrested that night. I spent my first months off drugs in the San Francisco County Jail. This was not my first time detoxing from heroin. Fortunately, it would be my last time. I was able to get into a treatment program followed by a sober-living house, where I lived for four years. In the years I have been off heroin, I have struggled with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. Many addicts find that once the drugs are removed, the underlying cause to the use can be nearly as painful as the use itself. When the drugs are removed, there can be an overwhelming sense of sadness. Getting clean can be seen as the ultimate solution. When the veil of chemicals lifts, the person may not like what is revealed to him or her. I dealt with these feelings without using heroin. However, the thought crossed my mind many times that relief can easily be found at the bottom of a spoon. That is part of my affliction. Everyone has a different treatment story. The reality for me was and is that stopping use of the substance is relatively easy compared with staying off drugs. The lifetime commitment to abstinence from drugs is what kills many people. When they have cravings to use, the stigma attached to heroin use forces them to deal or not deal with their affliction in private. This decision is frequently fatal, as in the case of Philip Seymour Hoffman. If we were courageous enough to try to conquer our insatiable desire for heroin, we feel weak telling another person that we feel like using is once again a viable option. I know these feelings. Fifteen years later, I still deal with the stigma of being a heroin addict. The track marks and scars are visible, but the pain of longing lies deep under the surface. Many heroin addicts are embarrassed to admit they ever had a problem with this powerful substance. If you are open about it, it triggers speculation and scrutiny as to your personal well-being. Addiction is a medical condition, yet there is little sympathy because society views it to be self-inflicted. I have chosen a different path for myself. I chose to be completely open about my experience in hope that others can learn that recovery is possible. What will I tell my children? They are too young to understand drugs, but they know I used to be homeless. I want them to understand how fortunate they are in hopes they will not go down the same path. What do I say when people see the movie and contact me through social media looking for answers to their own addiction? There are many roads to recovery. The path that I followed worked for me, but I cannot dictate what may work for another user struggling to get off drugs. I can only share my experience. I have spent my second chance at life teaching both harm reduction and overdose prevention because all of us have a life worth saving. I feel blessed I am able to bring a voice and a face to the issue.","Tracey Helton Mitchell says her drug addiction spiraled after she was given painkillers .

"(CNN) -- Creative new takes on dim sum are a common trend in Hong Kong restaurants these days, particularly at the higher end, with chefs incorporating traditionally Western ingredients such as truffles, foie gras or Maine lobster. At the same time, many classic dim sum dishes have fallen out of fashion, making them harder to find in the city. Chef Lee Kam, 76, worked at Hong Kong's Tsui Hang Village restaurant for 30 years before retiring. He recently rejoined to launch a special ""retro dim sum"" menu to bring back a few of the classics, but only in March and April. Lee says there are a couple reasons these dishes have gone out of style. ""First of all, a lot of the classic dim sum like the pork's liver siu mai and quail egg siu mai are very high in cholesterol,"" he says. ""It's unhealthy in modern day's standard. Therefore, fewer and fewer restaurants put them on the menu."" ""Secondly, they are labor-intensive and time-consuming."" Siu mai with quail egg . The quail egg is the star of this rich bite. A boiled quail's egg is placed inside the pork-centric filling, with the dumpling exterior enclosing the contents completely before the whole thing is steamed. The flavor of the bouncy filling is heightened (and complemented) by the quail egg, with the intense yolk the predominant taste. As chef Lee points out, part of the reason this dim sum dish is no longer as popular is due to the fact it packs a high cholesterol punch. But it's what experts refer to as the good cholesterol (HDL). Quail eggs have been used in Chinese medicine for years as a healing food, and the latest Western research says they're good for you too -- in moderation. More: Breathtaking pictures of Hong Kong airport's glory days . From the chef's point of view they're tricky to peel, so their preparation may not be cost effective for some restaurants. That said, it's one of the easier traditional dim sum on this list to find. Restaurants offering siu mai with quail egg include Lin Heung Tea House (famous for its classic dim sum), Sun Hing and, in March and April only, Tsui Hang Village. (See below for restaurant contact details.) Siu mai with liver . Pig liver is the hero of this dish. A sizable piece of flash-fried liver is draped over the mostly pork-filled dumpling. The combination of the mild yet rich liver and the filling (sometimes bearing hints of dried mandarin or tangerine) creates a complex, velvety smooth morsel that's surprisingly light to eat. No doubt it'd be a hit with foie gras fans. ""It takes a day or two to process the liver so it no longer carries the musky taste,"" says chef Lee. Fu Sing, Tim Ho Wan, Luk Yu and Lin Heung are go-to places for this dim sum. Many of these restaurants also serve siu mai with quail egg. Chinese sausage bun . Popular in the 1960s, the Chinese sausage bun is a seasonal creation sold mainly in the winter. Not to be confused with the bread-and-frankfurter bun sold in local bakeries, this bun, made from the same dough as char siu bao (barbecued pork bun) has a Chinese sausage (laap cheung) center. Any good version should feature a pillowy bun that complements and contrasts with the firm sausage. Steaming releases the sausage's oils, flavorings and marinades, resulting in a memorable mouthful. Health risks associated with the consumption of preserved meats, combined with the high fat content, are key reasons this bun is now a rarity on Hong Kong streets. Venues still serving it include Above & Beyond, Lin Heung, Sun Tung Lok and Forum Restaurant. Giant chicken bun . As the name implies, this dish consists of a large bun, which is steamed. What's not obvious from the name is the filling -- a smorgasbord of savory goodies that varies depending on the maker. Typical ingredients include chicken, barbecued pork, shrimp, duck, black mushroom and quail eggs that are often marinated in Chinese rose wine. It was once a favorite of Hong Kong's labor force as it's a satisfying and varied mini-meal. That's also why it's not such a hit now -- modern diners prefer to sample a bigger variety of lighter dim sum when eating. Plus, it's time consuming to make and requires a deft hand to get the balance of ingredients right and create a harmonious symphony of flavors. This one can be found in restaurants that have some history behind them, including Lin Heung and Luk Yu, as well as Tsui Hang Village (in March and April). Black sesame film rice roll . This jet black dessert is called ""fay lum"" (film) as it resembles a roll of camera film. Rice flour and black sesame are the key ingredients -- they're made into a paste, spread onto a tray, steamed, cooled and then rolled. It has a smooth, silky texture with a bit of bite that's all about the sesame. It's a tricky item to make that takes time, which is one reason it's not as common as it once was, making way for ubiquitous mango puddings or egg tarts. ""You have to first fry the sesame, then hand grind it to create a paste,"" says chef Lee. ""Then steam it until it forms a thin layer of film. If we're making them, we want them to be tasty. But in order to make them delicious, it takes a lot of effort."" Fay lum can still be found at Above & Beyond and Tsui Hang Village (in March and April as part of its retro dim sum menu). Beef wrapped in caul fat . Popular in the 1930s and 1940s, this juicy, bouncy morsel consists of the beef siu mai filling (sometimes beef balls) encased in a fine layer of caul fat, which melts through the beef when it's steamed. Chefs have different ways to prepare the beef, but it often consists of finely chopped meat, water chestnuts, coriander and dried mandarin peel. Above & Beyond and Maxim's Palace serve this classic, which has diminished in popularity for two reasons -- it takes skill to make and is considered too fatty by many diners. Rarer still . A few other beloved and missed dim sum dishes include steamed duck feet dim sum. Tsui Hang Village is serving steamed duck feet and yam rolled with bean curd skin in March and April as part of its special menu. Meanwhile, Lin Heung serves its duck feet with taro and fish maw wrapped in fried bean curd skin, while Fu Tung ofers a dish of braised duck feet with mushroom. There's also the amusingly named ""bone wrapped in paper"" and ""chicken wrapped in paper,"" an aromatic style of dim sum in which seasoned and marinated spare ribs or chicken are placed in a cellophane ""envelope"" along with ingredients such as dried mushroom, coriander, chestnut and Chinese sausage, before being deep fried. It's difficult to find the bone version; however the chicken version can sometimes be found at Above & Beyond.

"(CNN) -- A Guatemalan man accused in five rapes in Palm Beach County, Florida, has been extradited to the United States to face charges, officials announced Thursday. DNA evidence linked the suspect to the five victims, said Capt. Carol Gregg of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Baltazar Gabriel Delgado Ros was extradited Wednesday after Palm Beach investigators worked to bring him back to the United States. Delgado Ros had moved back to Guatemala after trying to change his physical appearance with a close-cropped haircut, Gregg said. In 2011, he was arrested in Guatemala on charges in the attempted rape of a minor, Gregg said. The Florida rapes took place between April 2009 and September 2011.

"(CNN) -- If you're a celebrity, royal, CEO or athlete planning to stride down the aisle, there's one name you'll hear sprouting from everyone's lips: Preston Bailey. The Panama-born designer has spent the past three decades decorating all manner of lush, lavish events around the globe, but weddings -- complete with his signature massive floralscapes -- are where he's most deeply rooted. Bailey is far from the only flower fanatic out there: A 2014 study by the Association of Bridal Consultants showed the average wedding costs of $28,016, and including about $1,800 for ""flowers and decorations."" The study estimates bridal bouquets at $139, reception table centerpieces at $366, flower girl flower at $86 and flower girl petals at $84. Bailey's newest book, ""Designing with Flowers,"" hits bookstores on April 8. CNN spoke with him about how to create a floral fantasy for your own wedding -- even if you don't have a bloomin' big budget. An edited transcript is below. CNN: Why do weddings and flowers go together so well? Bailey: The reason is simple. Flowers have always been a symbol of celebration. It's a great way to convey happiness and beauty. If you walk into a room that has flowers, you immediately respond in a very positive way. It's a mood-changing thing. You feel something. It's dealing with emotions. I really got turned on to flowers on one of the cherry blossom weekends in Washington. It was the most incredible thing in the world and I had a moment where I imagined, ""What would happen if I could bring this inside?"" CNN: Flowers aren't just visual. What impact are you going for with the rest of the senses? Bailey: The scent can almost transport you elsewhere. I've always felt I did a great job when I created a room with beautiful flowers and the guests are so happy and excited that they don't want to leave. I think ""OK, I nailed it."" I try to create rooms that are so beautiful and powerful, not just visually, but with scent, that people are happy and feel a sense of celebration. CNN: People have traditional spots for flowers in their wedding -- maybe in a bouquet, as centerpieces or tied to the ends of pews. Where should they focus their energy (and budget)? Bailey: Flowers don't need to be only in vases. They can be in a napkin or on the table or in the aisle. In the book, we have strands blowing in the wind. I'd like to encourage people to think out of the vase, in many different ways that can be exciting. You don't have to limit yourself to arrangements. CNN: Not everyone has a Preston Bailey-level budget. What can they do to get the most bang for their buck? Bailey: When I started, my first budget was $200. I very much believe today what I did then: with a smaller budget, you have to be realistic about the things that are most important. In my mind, one of the most important moments is seeing the bride walking down the aisle. That's the first impression, so you want to create a beautiful bouquet. [Editor's note: When Bailey married his husband Theo Bleckmann in 2013 at age 63, he emerged from a giant bridal sculpture that was rolled down the aisle, carrying a bouquet.] . Another important location is the dinner. They're going to be sitting at the table all night, so you want invest some money in a centerpiece or a detail on a napkin. I also like to do something beautiful for the escort card arrangement, because that sets the tone for the event. But a budget's a budget. It's a matter of how much you can afford and how much you can do with it. Concentrate on the areas that are more important and visible and you'll be just fine. CNN: When people are buying flowers, what do they need to consider? Bailey: A lot of places where you buy flowers, they have matured, and they're completely open. That means that they might only last another half a day. You have to know a little bit -- how long they're going to open, what room temperature they need to open. There are flowers that last 10 days and flowers that last one day. It is important to do your research. If you're using a florist, they will know this, but if you're trying to do it yourself, my strongest advice is that if the wedding is not that same day, don't buy flowers that are completely open, because they're going to die on your big wedding day. CNN: Yikes! So how should the flowers be preserved during all the preparation? Bailey: You have to keep in mind that flowers are living beings. It's important to always cut the stems at an angle, before you put them in water. And I'm very old-school. I do not believe in chemicals of any kind. Just make sure that you change the water daily. They love fresh water. They do not like to be in a warm environment, unless you want them to open very quickly. Make sure there's a comfortable room temperature if you want them to open slowly, but changing the water daily is my best advice. CNN: How much attention should couples pay to seasonality? Bailey: You should use seasonal flowers. It's much more cost-effective, they're much more available. In the winter, we do not have a lot available; however, there are flowers like amaryllis, that bloom in December. Paperwhites bloom then, too, and they can be used as potted plants. Amaryllis, by the way, is a beautiful flower with one long stem and it's perfect for a centerpiece. After the wedding, you get to keep it for another couple of weeks. There are ways that, as a designer, I have to think about what's more practical for the season. If you buy spring flowers in the winter, it's going to be five times more expensive. CNN: I'm sure some of your clients want that! Bailey: [Laughs] Yes! You can find them, but it's a lot of cost and I would not advise that. CNN: Is there some flower you hope you never see again? Bailey: I used to say that about carnations, and I changed my mind. There are a couple of cultures that like carnations, and I'm using them now for sculptures instead of just arrangements. They're great because they're very long-lasting -- it's like a flower that never dies! But I always get into trouble when I say this, but I'm going to say it anyway: I grew up in Panama, and in my backyard, there was tons of bird-of-paradise, and we considered them weeds. So I'm not crazy about them. CNN: What flower would you love for more couples to use? Bailey: Vanda orchids. It's a very deep purple flower, and I think it's one of the most beautiful orchids around. But they are so cost-prohibitive, it's ridiculous. I can't wait for the day that somebody creates a less expensive way to make them accessible. On the more affordable side: classic roses. Throughout the year, the cost has been going down because the market is so saturated. Because so many people have been using them, roses have become very cost-effective. CNN: Let's say the couple wants to re-create the magic on their first anniversary. What would be a fun way to recreate the event on a more intimate scale, florally speaking? Bailey: I think it's great to keep the celebration going and see what flowers you used in your wedding and use them again in a different way. I remember one of my clients was celebrating a second anniversary, and we replicated the bride's bouquet. I think that was really great! Celebrate the day with some of the same flowers and I think it could be very meaningful. CNN: You may or may not be able to answer this question, but what's the biggest flower budget a client has ever given you to work with? Bailey: And you're absolutely right -- I can't answer that. It's such a bummer because I'm under confidentiality agreements. But again, it's all relative and what's a lot of money for one person is not for the other. How much did you spend on your wedding flowers, and did you get creative?

"(CNN) -- Most people are carrying around historical records in their DNA, with clues to how people from genetically distinct groups intermingled over the last 4,000 years. That's the conclusion of a new study in the journal Science. Researchers set out to pinpoint which groups intermixed, and when, over thousands of years, using modern DNA. They thought this information could complement other historical records. ""The results suggest DNA is indeed a powerful means of reconstructing history, which then might be used to identify the genetic legacies of historically well-attested events ... and highlight surprising events with a less clear historical context,"" authors Garrett Hellenthal and Simon Myers wrote in an e-mail. The scientists have created an interactive map showcasing their findings. You can explore the map in detail on the researchers' website, admixturemap.paintmychromosomes.com. The technical term for people from genetically different groups having babies together is ""genetic admixture."" This has happened throughout history when people migrated into a new geographic region where others were already living. Researchers say there have been many such admixture events among people from populations that were separated by thousands of miles. Sometimes populations adjacent to each other have distinct ancestry and history. Did you know that your DNA contains genetic segments you've inherited from groups that intermingled in the past? Researchers can look at these signatures for clues about major historical mixings of populations. DNA from a person today can also give scientists an idea of how long ago two groups genetically mixed. The more time that has passed since the admixture event, the shorter the inherited DNA segments from the original groups are likely to be. That's because there would have been more generations in between, and there would have been reshuffling of genetic material in each generation. There are limitations to the method, however. When genetic mixing involves more than three groups, the researchers can't identify those specific events. The researchers were also limited in how well they could estimate when the same, or very similar, groups interbred on multiple occasions in one descendant group's history. Oldest human DNA found in Spain . The researchers looked at a genetic data set of 1,490 people who come from 95 genetically distinct groups worldwide. Their software, Globetrotter, was able to describe genetic mixing events dating back about 4,500 years. The expansion of the Mongol empire, which took place from 1206 to 1368, appears to have been highly influential on many populations in Europe and Asia. Previous studies have also supported that idea. Genghis Khan and his armies began this monumental historical event that influenced seven populations included in this study. The Arab expansion and slave trade, which began around the seventh century, also had a large genetic impact on many groups, including people from around the Mediterranean, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf. The study's findings are consistent with that historical timeframe, but suggest that sub-Saharan Africans and Moroccans mixed earlier. A group called the Kalash, from Pakistan, appears to come from an admixture event that happened sometime before 206 B.C., when people from a more European group hooked up with a more Central/South Asian group. Researchers say the Kalash are geographically isolated, originating in the Hindu Kush mountains, which is why they don't show genetic signatures of a more recent admixture event. Local tradition says the Kalash are descended from the army of Alexander the Great; the new study does not rule that out, since the time period of the mixing event could have been about right. ""We have tried to let the genetic information 'speak' in this study, but future interpretation of signals -- especially in follow-up studies of specific regions -- would benefit from expertise from ... historians, linguists and others,"" Hellenthal and Myers said. Some groups showed genetic signals that the researchers were unable to precisely interpret. For instance, genetic material from French people suggests an intermixing between northern and southern Europeans and northern Africans, between 785 and 1,385 years ago, but the event itself is still unclear. The researchers were not able to pick up signals of some well-established historical intermixings, such as migrations into the United Kingdom from northern European groups, because of the small sample sizes. It is possible that a mutation could arise in two populations independently, but that is thought to be rare. ""If two individuals share a mutation, it is statistically much more likely that the mutation occurred in a common ancestor of both individuals, rather than arising independently in the ancestors of each of them,"" Hellenthal and Myers said. The researchers are involved in a project called People of the British Isles, which is looking specifically at the genetic origins of people from the United Kingdom. Other projects are looking in more depth at areas such as the Caribbean, Ethiopia and the Americas. The researchers say in the study that as whole-genome sequencing improves and analyses are able to incorporate more people as well as ancient DNA, we may reach a ""better understanding of ancient events where little or no historical record exists, to identify many additional events ... and to provide more precise event characterization than is currently possible."" There may also be implications for public health, as researchers get better at identifying disease risks that are higher in specific populations.

"(CNN) -- In the midst of uncertainty, Mizune, 14, one of thousands of refugees who fled Syria since the civil war began, is sure of one thing: ""We can help and improve our nation with education."" These are not just words; she turns them into action. Despite her young age, she is determined to make it known in the camp that a brighter future begins in the classroom. Mizune, whose father asked not to use her last name, arrived in Za'atari, Jordan, along with her family when the massive refugee influx began. She has spent her time promoting education in the camp, where half of the population is made up of children. Much of her time in Za'atari has been spent going from tent to tent, from mosque to mosque, talking to children and parents about why getting back in the classroom is important. ""It's very important to me and important to society that I raise awareness. I want to emphasize the importance of education,"" she said. For her effort, she has been called the ""Malala of Za'atari,"" in reference to Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai. On October 9, 2012, a gunman shot Malala when she was going home from school. She survived and has continued to speak out on the importance of education. In fact, Malala and Mizune are friends, having spent many hours together in the Za'atari camp when Malala visted there in February.. Mizune shares the same passion for education. ""We would go to tents and talk to people about their most pressing problems that prevent them from going to school. We would try to find solutions and talk about the rights of children to education,"" she said. Mizune's work started when UNICEF began building schools in Za'atari. Mizune saw this and decided to help. ""Children are the most important people in society,"" she said. ""Parents influence their kids, so the most important thing was educating the parents. People listened, and some had different points of view, but we were able to convince a big number to come to school."" At this point, about 70% of the children in the camp attend school. According to Michele Servadei from UNICEF, the children's parents have been the biggest challenge when it comes to education. ""In many cases, parents think that they're going to go back (to Syria) soon,"" he said, ""and it's not worth sending the children to be educated."" The ongoing Syrian civil war, which started its third year in March, began when protests against President Bashar al-Assad's regime erupted in Daraa. Demonstrations and unrest spread to nearly every city in Syria. The government responded with military action. Thousands have died, and millions have fled the country. As of February, there are an estimated 2.6 million Syrian refugees are spread across Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt. Back in Za'atari, challenges are infinite, ranging from water supply and mobile home distribution to keeping warm during the winter. Za'atari has become the second largest refugee camp in the world. If it were a city, it would the fifth-largest in Jordan. As many as 150,000 people live in the camp. However, that number changes every day as hundreds come or go. Days go by, and an end to the Syrian crisis does not seem near, but Mizune, who dreams of someday becoming a Journalist, is already thinking of better days for her country's future. ""A kid will face many challenges in their lives,"" she said, ""and it's important to take advantage of education despite the circumstances, because life will go on.""","With the help of one teen, 70% of children at Jordanian refugee camp now attend school .

"(CNN) -- Curt Schilling -- a standout pitcher who belonged to three World Series championship teams before becoming an ESPN analyst -- has cancer, he announced Wednesday. The retired Major League Baseball player did not specify what type of cancer he had or his prognosis, only that ""I've recently been diagnosed."" ""I've always believed life is about embracing the gifts and rising up to meet the challenges,"" Schilling, 47, said in a statement. ""... I've been so very blessed and I feel grateful for what God has allowed my family to have and experience, and I'll embrace this fight just like the rest of them, with resolute faith and head on."" After rising up the Boston Red Sox minor league ranks, Schilling broke into the Major Leagues with Baltimore in 1988. He went on to star with the Philadelphia Phillies before ascending another level in his career upon joining the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001. That season, Schilling not only posted a 22-6 record and an ERA of 2.98, but he earned World Series MVP honors in leading the team to its first-ever championship. He maintained the momentum the following season, when -- for the second straight year -- Major League players voted him as the National League's most outstanding pitcher. Schilling went on to obtain legendary status in Boston upon returning to the Red Sox via trade before the 2004 season. The right-handed starter posted impressive numbers during the regular season, then didn't let an injury -- that left him with a famously bloody sock -- stop him from contributing to Boston's first World Series title in 86 years. He retired in 2007, after the Red Sox again won the title, then led an ill-fated video game company based in Rhode Island. ESPN would later hire him as a baseball analyst. The network issued a statement Wednesday saying, ""His ESPN teammates wish him continued strength in his cancer fight, and we look forward to welcoming him back to our baseball coverage whenever he's ready."" This isn't the Schilling family's first brush with cancer. His wife, Shonda, went public -- even inviting cameras in to capture her fifth and final surgery -- in the early 2000s with her fight with malignant melanoma. She afterward created the Shade Foundation of America, a group geared toward educating children about skin cancer and prevention.","Schilling says he's ""recently been diagnosed"" with an unspecified cancer .

"(CNN) -- Drug dealers beware: If a client of yours overdoses and dies in the state of New Jersey, prosecutors there may charge you in the death. In what's becoming a growing trend nationwide, New Jersey prosecutors are using aggressive tactics to curb rampant fatal drug overdoses in their communities, including revitalizing an old law that holds drug dealers responsible in the drug-induced death of a client. The ""Strict Liability for Drug-Induced Death"" law allows prosecutors to pursue homicide charges against someone who has manufactured or sold a controlled dangerous substance -- including heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines -- that directly causes death. The statute was enacted in 1987 but wasn't well known and was rarely used until recently. Convictions on the charge carry a penalty of a maximum of 20 years in New Jersey state prison. The number of fatal drug overdoses more than doubled nationwide from 2000 to 2010, with heroin-related deaths in particular increasing by more than 60%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ocean County, New Jersey, is not immune to the growing drug problem: Fatal drug overdoses there doubled between 2012 and 2013, from 53 to 112 deaths. Prosecutor Joseph D. Coronato wants to ""raise the alarm"" on the drug problem not just in his county, but across his state. Shortly after he was appointed prosecutor in March 2013, the county had eight overdose deaths in the space of one week. ""I want to send a signal loud and clear -- we have a problem here of epidemic proportions of all the people dying of overdoses and that's my challenge. And I'm going to do something,"" Coronato said, adding that the liability law ""is one of the tools in my tool chest to attack this problem."" By charging drug dealers under the law, the prosecutor says he has more leverage in moving up the drug-dealing chain, because dealers who are prosecuted know they can be facing serious jail time. Coronato also changed protocols for how authorities respond to an overdose call and treat each with ""all hands on deck"" to better make the charges stick. A homicide detective is now dispatched with narcotic detectives to the scene and each case is treated as a homicide from the beginning, Coronato says. ""If you're going to be a dealer, and that heroin is going to kill somebody, we're going to take that death... and we'll treat it as a homicide,"" Coronato said. ""If we track it back to the ultimate dealer, we're going to charge you under the law for that death."" Coronato also trains authorities on how to use Naloxone nasal spray on victims, a potentially lifesaving drug that can reverse opioid prescription drug and heroin overdoses. Since April 2013, Coronato and his team have had 12 cases related to the drug-induced death statute, including one that resulted in a guilty plea, his office says. New Jersey law protects overdose patients from prosecution . A guilty plea . In November 2013, Kenneth Staunton, 33, pleaded guilty to manslaughter after dealing drugs to Raymond Farino, 27, who died of an overdose 10 months earlier. Staunton was sentenced to 7 1/2 years with no early release for manslaughter and 4 years to be served concurrently for a heroin possession charge, according to the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office. CNN contacted Staunton in prison but he refused to talk to the network. Senior Assistant Prosecutor Patrick Sheehan, who prosecuted the Staunton case, said Farino was alone when he injected himself with a fatal dose of heroin January 17, 2013. Staunton had met Farino earlier that day and sold heroin to him. A few hours later, Farino was dead, Sheehan said. The evidence that made the overdose liability charges stick and ultimately led to a manslaughter guilty plea were explicit text messages exchanged between the two men and bags stamped with the words ""Il Capo"" located at the overdose scene that were traced back to Staunton. ""Heroin bags with that particular stamp had been flooding the area in Lacy Township and (authorities) had been investigating Kenneth Staunton for that,"" Sheehan said. Marianne Farino, Raymond's mother, found him lying on the floor of their dining room. Though he had battled substance addiction for years, he was sober in the seven months before his death, she said. ""Which really almost brings me to tears because those seven months were like... (he was) our son again,"" she said. Marianne Farino doesn't know what triggered her son to go back to heroin that one last time. She deals with waves of different emotions, from shock and anger to relief. ""Maybe this could set precedent,"" she said. ""You know, to the other dealers; that this could happen to you."" A rarely-used law . CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said this first-degree, strict-liability law is an ""exceptionally rare criminal statute,"" and notes that most strict-liability statutes are civil. The law explicitly says that in a court case, the defense cannot argue that the victim knowingly contributed to his own death by taking the lethal drug -- removing any argument for or against intent to cause harm, Callan said. Ocean County certainly isn't the first New Jersey jurisdiction to charge under this law; counties like Cape May have consistently used this statute for years, said Cape May County prosecutor Robert L. Taylor. Passaic and Bergen county prosecutors' offices have also increasingly been charging under the statute, with several cases this year alone. But the New Jersey law is ""harsh in comparison to the majority of other states,"" according to an article written by James H. Knight in the Seton Hall Law Review in 2004. States such as Louisiana and Nevada classify drug-induced death statutes as a second-degree felony, and Pennsylvania and Minnesota punish it as a third -degree felony. In comparison, the alleged drug dealers arrested in connection to actor Philip Seymour Hoffman's heroin overdose death in New York will probably not be charged with anything more than criminal possession of a controlled substance, prosecutors say. The New Jersey law was enacted in the late 1980s and upheld by State Supreme Court in 1994. It was intended as a way for prosecutors to go after ""upper echelon drug dealers, who oftentimes have no interaction with their buyers and are therefore virtually immune to homicide prosecution,"" Knight said. Though the intent of the law was benevolent in theory, Knight says the majority of cases in the beginning prosecuted ""minors with no record or evidence of prior drug dealing."" In its first 17 years on the books, the charge was prosecuted just 32 times, according to the New Jersey Law Journal. Of those cases, 25 involved friends of the overdose victim and only three involved prosecutions of actual drug dealers. New Jersey prosecutors say that the recent increase in the number of drug overdoses, as well as word spreading about law's success, will ostensibly result in more charges. However, some prosecutors say another law enacted in 2013 allows for the ""strict liability for drug-induced death"" statute to be prosecuted with the intent that was originally envisioned. On May 2, 2013, Gov. Chris Christie signed the ""Overdose Prevention Act,"" which grants immunity from prosecution if someone seeks medical assistance for a person believed to be suffering from a drug overdose. ""In the past, there have been instances where persons were reluctant or unwilling to call authorities for help for fear that this might lead to an arrest or prosecution for illegal drug use or possession,"" the state's acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman wrote. New Jersey prosecutors suggest the latest law may help friends of victims be more willing to tell authorities who sold them the drugs in the moments after an overdose. While the future success of the overdose liability law remains to be seen, Marianne Farino hopes that some good can come from her son's death. ""Staunton didn't put the needle in the arm, I get that. But I'm happy he pleaded guilty,"" she said of her son's drug dealer. ""It's another dealer off the road."" Opinion: We can prevent fatal ODs . CNN's Rosa Flores and Ray Sanchez and legal analyst Sunny Hostin contributed to this report.","The law was first enacted in 1987 .

"(CNN) -- To fully appreciate all the A350 XWB promises to offer, your imagination needs to take a rather giant leap. On display for the first time at an airshow, the brand new extra wide bodied passenger jet has been one of the Singapore Airshow's major attention grabbers. Flying high above the Changi Exhibition Centre, it looks sleek and maneuverable. It's a big draw, part of the airshow's static display sitting beside its key competitor, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. But step on board, and it's unlike any other experience on a passenger jet, because the A350 is still a test aircraft. Packed with flight testing gear, including the equivalent of 400 kilometers of bright orange testing cables, every nuance of what happens when the plane is in the air is captured by equipment that feeds data live to Airbus' headquarters in Toulouse. Some 600,000 parameters can be monitored and recorded at any one time as part of that testing. Large water tanks under the floor are filled to the exact weight the aircraft will carry when it's full of passengers and baggage. The A350 first took to the skies on June 14 last year. Soon after, it performed a fly-by at the Paris Airshow. So far two test planes have clocked 1,000 hours of flying time, some in extreme conditions. To date the A350 has experienced the cold of northern Canada and the high altitude of La Paz in Bolivia. In the next few weeks it will also conduct tests in the stifling heat of the Middle East. All five test A350s will have to fly for 2,500 hours before achieving certification. Selling features . This is a passenger jet made up of 53% composite material according to Simon Azar from the Airbus Marketing Division, the highest of any commercial aircraft. This allows the A350 to travel as fuel efficiently as possible, lowering operating costs. The wings of the jet incorporate the jet maker's latest aerodynamics and advanced low-speed controls. The curled winglets are designed to reduce drag, again saving fuel. Essentially the plane will fly further for less, to help offset the high cost of buying the aircraft, which has a list price of $254 million-322 million depending on size. Also adding to the customer experience, Airbus says, are the A350's low noise levels. This airplane has already been nicknamed by some as the ""Hushliner,"" a title Airbus has embraced. ""The noise levels for the aircraft are going to be very low,"" says Azar. ""It's designed to be a very quiet aircraft both in the cabin and for surrounding space as the aircraft flies around. That's very important. Noise pollution around airports is something that we work to reduce."" Airbus also says its custom Rolls Royce engine is unrivaled in terms of fuel efficiency, and contributes to the aircraft achieving a 25% reduction in seat-mile costs and 25% lower carbon dioxide emissions. Passenger experience . For passengers, Airbus says it's offering great quality air (replaced on the aircraft every two to three minutes), wider cabins and 18-inch-wide seats in economy. When carrying 315 passengers this plane can travel 7,800 nautical miles, or an equivalent 17 hours, useful when research suggests passengers of the future will be flying for longer. The twin aisle jet can carry between 250 and 400 passengers. It's designed to have an economy class carrying nine abreast, but the A350 will come in three sizes, the A350-800, A350-900 and A350-1000, and can be configured to seat passengers from eight to 10 abreast. It'll be up to the customer airlines to choose the mode of inflight entertainment. Business class passengers will experience all the perks, with Airbus promising mood lighting and the option for full flat seats. First class can be fitted at the customer airline's discretion. It's a lot to get your head around when you look at the airplane as it is today. ""Flight crew class"" is what Azar laughingly calls the 50 odd well-worn gray seats the jet is currently fitted with, all recovered from old aircraft. For now, these are strictly reserved for crew and mechanics during test flights, but that will change. The first fit-out of an A350 with a proper cabin is expected next month. VIPs and media only . The A350 arrived in Singapore shortly before the airshow started. Only a select few have been allowed inside, including aviation journalists and VIP visitors, including Britain's Undersecretary of State for Transport Stephen Hammond. On Thursday the plane is due to fly 13 hours back to Toulouse, where rigorous tests will continue until the plane is ready to go to market. Airbus says it expects that to be in the fourth quarter of this year. Its debut customer, Qatar Airways, has ordered 80 of the aircraft. Airbus has a backlog of orders for 814 A350 jets, from 39 customers, almost a third of which are from the Asia Pacific region.

"(CNN) -- Niki Gianni was 11 or 12 when she found a video on YouTube called ""Meet Your Meat."" Saddened and disgusted by the footage from a slaughterhouse, the Chicago girl announced she was no longer going to eat meat. Her parents were less than thrilled. ""When she first said she wanted to be a vegetarian, we were just looking at each other and we said, 'We can't be switching meals for you. You are not going to get your protein.' We were not educated in the health benefits,"" said Gianni's mother, Julie Gianni. While many parents worry whether their vegetarian or vegan children will receive adequate nutrition for their growing bodies, the American Dietetic Association says such diets, as long as they are well-planned, are appropriate for all phases of life, including childhood and adolescence. ""Appropriately planned"" vegetarian or vegan diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases, the dietetic association says. ""You can really feel the difference when you are eating something from the ground and something from a factory,"" said Niki Gianni, an animal activist who became a vegan shortly after embracing the vegetarian lifestyle. 10-year-old: Why I became vegetarian in first grade . Now an 18-year-old college freshman, Niki Gianni said her eating habits expanded her palate and turned her away from processed foods. Her food choices also influenced her family: Her mother is now a vegan and her father and sister are vegetarians. The number of vegetarians in the United States is expected to increase over the next decade, according to the dietetic association. A vegetarian diet is associated with a lower risk of death from ischemic heart disease, and vegetarians also appear to have lower overall cancer rates, lower blood pressure and lower rates of hypertension than nonvegetarians. Vegetarianism is more than just not eating meat, said Roberta Anding, a registered dietitian at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital and a spokesperson for the dietetic association. ""It's really embracing more of that plant-based lifestyle and having enough variety in your diet that you can be well-nourished,"" Anding said. ""You can be unbelievably well-nourished on a vegetarian diet if you choose your foods wisely and appropriately."" Lilian Cheung, director of health promotion and communication at Harvard School of Public Health's Department of Nutrition, agreed. Teens who abstain from eating animal-based foods but who take in refined and sugary foods such as French fries and sodas are not doing themselves any favors, she said. Eating a variety of vegetables and fruits of all colors and eating the purest form possible is vital in these diets, Cheung said. Beans, legumes, nuts, tofu and seeds all are excellent protein sources, said Cheung, who said veganism and vegetarianism are becoming more mainstream among young people. ""I think the reason why veganism is getting more and more popular is there are more celebrities like President Clinton,"" embracing the lifestyle, said Cheung, editorial director of the department's nutrition website, The Nutrition Source. Julie and Niki Gianni said they have encountered a lot of people who had misconceptions about vegans and vegetarians, including that they are weak or that they are not getting the vitamins and minerals they need. ""(People) asked, 'How are you going to get your protein?' They just look at you like you are abusing your children,"" Julie Gianni said. In the beginning, the Giannis didn't quite know what to serve their daughter. Niki Gianni ate a lot of vegetarian burger patties and chicken nuggets. ""I think this happens to a lot of vegetarians: I doubled up on eating eggs and dairy because my parents weren't sure what to feed their 12-year-old who didn't eat meat,"" she said. Now, Julie Gianni makes her own goulash and noodles and frequently cooks with seitan, a high-protein meat substitute made from wheat. Niki Gianni said she has yet to find a vegetable she won't eat. She loves portobello mushroom and artichoke sandwiches, and dines in the vegan cafeteria at college. Niki Gianni and her family have done copious research about their lifestyles, becoming educated about meeting their nutritional needs through an array of fresh foods. Such vigilance and education is vital, experts said, because adolescence is characterized by the second and final period of rapid growth and development. Those growing bodies need nutrients, including calcium, vitamin D, B12 and iron. Teens or children who are vegetarian and who then also decide to give up dairy products need to find an alternate source of calcium, Anding said. While calcium can be found in almonds and in green leafy vegetables, the amount is small. Vitamin B12, found in animal protein, can become a concern if dairy or eggs leave the diet, Anding said. Vitamin B12 deficiencies manifest over time. The vitamin, which can be found in fortified cereals, is stored in the liver and when levels are low, the body withdraws the vitamin from the organ. ""Sooner or later you are going to run out,"" Anding said. ""It's not going to be instant."" Anding said she treated four young women with vitamin B12 deficiencies that showed up about a year into their veganism. ""You can end up with permanent cognitive issues. I applaud you for looking at this from an environmental perspective but I don't want to save the planet and sacrifice you,"" she said. ""You have to take a B12 supplement."" To aid iron intake, Anding recommends using a cast iron skillet for cooking; some of the iron will leach into the food. Vitamin and mineral supplements also provide a way to get adequate iron and other essential nutrients, she said. ""Clearly, there are some big benefits of a plant-based diet, so I'm not objecting to that. I think the more restrictive the diet becomes, the more exclusive the diet becomes, the harder it becomes for the average person to execute those diet changes,"" she said. Heather Lazaro, whose family lives in Orange County in Southern California, said she was concerned when her daughter, then 11, came home from school and announced she didn't want to eat meat. ""We didn't think it was going to last,"" said Lazaro, whose daughter Alyssa is now 16. ""To this day, I always worry if she is getting the right amount of protein and vitamins"" and nutrition she needs, she said. Alyssa Lazaro is a pescatarian; she doesn't eat land animals or birds but eats fish. She said she just wanted to try giving up meat. In addition to consuming plenty of vegetables and fruit, she eats soy products, protein shakes and eggs. She said she feels better staying away from meat. ""Whenever I eat vegetables I just feel a little bit more energetic and ready to go through life with a big smile on my face,"" the high school student said. Anding and Cheung said young people and their parents should get information from reputable websites such as eatright.org, kidseatright.org and thenutritionsource.org. Vegetarians and vegans have to be willing to explore new foods and Anding said she would discourage such lifestyles for children who like only a handful of foods, including meat. Anding, who for decades has worked with children and teens with eating disorders, said parents also need to make sure their children are eating. She has seen veganism used to mask those disorders. ""It's really unfortunate because it is taking a lifestyle that is unbelievably healthy and using it to perpetuate an eating disorder,"" she said. Cheung recommends that parents talk to their children's pediatrician about a vitamin supplement and have them see a registered dietician so they have a good overview of what they should be eating every day. ""It can be a very unhealthy diet if the choices are unhealthy,"" she said. ""But it is very possible to have a very healthful vegan diet as well if you choose wisely. ""We just need to get more literate, get more knowledge. I don't think we should basically just categorize one way or another,"" Cheung said. ""It just depends on what foods are chosen.""","Parents worry whether vegetarian or vegan children will receive adequate nutrition .

"(CNN) -- When is a kiss not just a kiss? When it's a political undoing. On Monday, a Louisiana newspaper posted a video showing freshman Louisiana Rep. Vance McAllister, a conservative Christian and married father of five, in an extended passionate kiss. In his government office. With someone other than his wife. That someone, congressional staffer Melissa Hixon Peacock, also happens to be married, to a high school pal and campaign donor of McAllister's, in fact. According to payroll records, says Politico, she started working for McAllister the day after he won his seat. Her husband, Heath Peacock, said McAllister ""has wrecked my life"" and that he and his wife are ""headed for divorce."" He also claimed that, by the way, McAllister faked his devotion to religion to win votes. Certainly, it wasn't the most strategic of office affairs. Though a recent Quinnipiac poll reported that it is politicians' abuse of power, more than their (increasingly exposed) extramarital activities, that turns off voters, by hiring a family friend on the taxpayers' dime and then getting romantic with her at the office, McAllister seems to have accomplished both. But the bigger problem the congressman faces, and what could well lead to his downfall, is hypocrisy. People may forgive romantic indiscretions, but it can be harder to make them—or potential opponents—forget religious ones. McAllister, who had no previous political experience, ran on a platform of ""faith and family,"" touting his 16-year marriage, five children, and pre-church Sunday breakfasts. He described himself as a ""true conservative"" and called on endorsements from family members of A&E's popular and extremely socially conservative ""Duck Dynasty"" — the men among them known for being anti-gay and, as it happens, anti-adultery. McAllister invited Willie Robertson, the star of the show, to accompany him to the State of the Union address in January. In at least one campaign ad, he asked voters to pray for him. Said Heath Peacock, ""He broke out the religious card and he's about the most nonreligious person I know."" But it apparently helped; he won. Meanwhile, who is out of a job? Melissa Peacock. News reports say that she was ""removed from the payroll"" within the 24 hours after their embrace was exposed. While ""there's no ethics rule that says you can't make out with your staffer,"" as the National Journal pointed out, House Ethics rules do require members to ""conduct themselves at all times in a manner that reflects creditably on the House,"" and it's possible McAllister will face an ethics investigation. In 2010, House Speaker John Boehner asked Indiana Rep. Mark Souder to resign after Souder admitted an affair with a staffer in his district office. McAllister has apologized for the indiscretion, sort of, but said he has no plans to resign. In fact, he said, he'll run for re-election next fall. That's not exactly an act of contrition; he seems more sorry he was caught than for damaging the public trust. Though certainly it takes two to tango, as they say—and we don't yet know details, including how the relationship started, or even if it has stopped — it's clear McAllister has different rules for himself than for others. And that for a guy with scant political experience, he felt plenty comfortable with using his position (and his office) for personal gain. If he runs again, at the very least, he might want to rethink that whole ""faith, family and hard work"" message the next time around.","Peggy Drexler: Freshman Rep. Vance McAllister caught in video kissing congressional staffer .

"(CNN) -- David Thompson's Bangkok restaurant nahm is now officially Asia's best restaurant, but the understated Australian-born chef says he's cross. ""I've lost money. I bet against myself,"" says Thompson. ""I had several bets and it's ranged from two bottles of sauce of Sriracha, a bottle of fish sauce, to quite a few hundred dollars. Damn,"" he says. With dishes ranging from smoked fish, peanut and tapioca dumplings, to salted threadfin perch with ginger, chili and green mango on betel leaves, nahm's fiery menu is hailed as a shining example of fine Thai cuisine. Moving up from third place at last year's inaugural S. Pellegrino & Acqua Panna Asia's 50 Best Restaurants Awards, Thompson says he hopes the honor awarded at last night's glittering ceremony at Capella on Singapore's Sentosa Island, will provide a positive boost during what has been a troubled few months in Thailand. ""Bangkok, as you know, is going through a little bit of a fractious time,"" he says. ""Hopefully this will help to sustain us, but also show that Thai culture still continues on despite the political disturbances that are occurring at the moment."" Celebrating excellent food and the top chefs of the region, the list of Asia's 50 Best Restaurants is an off-shoot of the prestigious World's 50 Best Restaurant Awards, one of the highest accolades in the industry. ""That might sound obvious because we're in Asia, but there's been a lot of Western influence especially at the fine dining end of the market, a lot of European influence,"" says William Drew, awards organizer and editor of the UK's Restaurant magazine. ""But I think that perhaps is waning and Asian cuisine is forging a stronger identity in international terms."" Back to our roots . Drew says the best chefs are embracing their unique histories and using them as a basis for creating contemporary, innovative dishes. One example is the recipient of The Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award which went to Ivan Li, executive chef and co-owner of Family Li Imperial Cuisine, in Beijing's Shunyi district. Following in the footsteps of his great grandfather who oversaw the imperial kitchen in the Forbidden City during the Qing dynasty, Li delicately reproduces the recipes passed down through his family for four generations over an oven fire. ""Asian food is very unique,"" says Li. ""But we have also lost a lot of the traditions of the food culture. Now we're trying to rediscover and recreate some of the traditions."" More than 900 global food experts including chefs, restaurateurs, food writers, food critics and other well traveled gourmands have judged the awards, each choosing their top seven restaurants. ""We don't give them any criteria. It's entirely up to them,"" says Drew. ""So one judge might be looking for the perfect plate of food, another judge might be more influenced by the atmosphere and the vibe and the whole experience. ""We don't say it has to be about anything except the overall enjoyment of the restaurant,"" he says. This year Japan leads Asia's 50 Best Restaurants with 10 of its dining establishments making it onto the list. Singapore and Hong Kong both have eight restaurants in the top 50 and Mainland China has seven, including Robuchon au Dome in Macau. Taiwan is represented on the list for the first time with Taichung City's Le Moût taking spot 24, and chef Lanshu Chen named Veuve Clicquot Asia's Best Female Chef. Lanshu blends the local influences and ingredients she grew up with, with the French culinary traditions she later studied abroad.

"(CNN) -- His wounds as an Army Ranger in Afghanistan in 2009 left him in the fight of his life -- a fight for his life, for sheer survival. And when his story was told by the President of the United States, that story brought a packed house in the U.S. Capitol to its feet for a standing ovation. ""Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit,"" President Barack Obama declared to the nation in his State of the Union address in January. Being singled out for presidential recognition made Remsburg overnight the most recognizable veteran in the country, a position he's not entirely comfortable with. But he says he's OK with the attention as long as it brings attention to all wounded veterans. ""There are other people who would have quit a long time ago and would have been happy in their wheelchair. Me? Oh, no,"" he said in an interview on CNN's ""New Day"" that aired Thursday. It's incredibly poignant when he makes such statements. His speech is labored and a little slurred. Every word and movement clearly takes great effort. But it is effort he makes without complaint, without flinching. Before the accident . Remsburg joined the Army when he was 18 years old. He wanted to join sooner, but his father, Craig, would not let him. He went through the rigorous, specialized training to become an elite Army Ranger, deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan 10 times. He spent a total of 39 months in combat, and was eventually made leader of his company's heavy weapons squad. In June 2009, he participated in ceremony for the 65th anniversary of D-Day, parachuting in on the shores of Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, as part of a ceremony President Obama attended. Afterward, the two met briefly. What Remsburg didn't know then was that he would meet the President again just a year later, under very different circumstances. On October 1, 2009, Remsburg and his platoon hit a roadside bomb in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and the immediate explosion nearly killed him. He was found face down in a pool of water, shrapnel lodged in his brain. His father still remembers the phone call. ""I immediately went into the mode of saying, 'Hey Cory, how are you doing?' "" he said. ""And there was silence. And that's when the officer identified himself as Cory's company commander and said Cory's been injured."" Remsburg was in a coma for more than three months. He's undergone dozens of surgeries, is still blind in his right eye and is partially paralyzed on his left side. But he's come a long way from those first few months. An unseen, personal battle at the State of the Union . Recovery . After years of rehabilitation centers and hospitals, Remsburg now lives at home with a full-time caregiver in Phoenix, Arizona. This week, Remsburg returned to Casa Colina Centers for Rehabilitation in Pomona, California, where he lived for 16 months going through intensive daily therapy to regain his ability to walk and talk. This was his first time back since leaving 10 months ago. Everyone there -- doctors, nurses and patients -- all came up to say hi, give him a hug and ask how he's doing. Meeting an American hero . Remsburg acknowledges that his recovery would not have been possible without the support of his family. His stepmother, Annie, left her job for more than a year and a half to stay with him full-time at a hospital in Florida. And his father's employer has allowed him the flexibility to be at his son's side whenever necessary. His parents are also grateful to all the charities that have supported their son's recovery over the past five years. Remsburg clearly has been through a lot, but one thing he has not lost is his sense of humor. During a speech therapy session that tested articulation and memory, he had to name something from a category -- his favorite baseball team, a color, a state, a street name -- followed by a card number from a deck. When asked to name a news website, he said, ""Fox News,"" but then remembered who was in the room with him, and quickly corrected himself by saying, ""Or, CNN. Oops."" Meetings with the President . Remsburg met President Obama for the second time in 2010, shortly after coming out of his coma. The President happened to be visiting Walter Reed Medical Center outside Washington, and realized he knew the young man once he saw the photo of their first meeting hanging on the wall near his bed. Remsburg is the only known wounded veteran to have met the President both before and after his injury. Their third meeting was about a year ago, when President Obama made a stop in Phoenix and requested to see how Remsburg was doing. When Obama arrived, Remsburg did something that shocked even his father. ""Cory got up, saluted him, then got up with a walker and walked across the floor,"" Craig said. For Cory, the gesture was to prove a point: ""To show the President that this is what happens when you don't quit."" Bipartisan outpouring for wounded war hero at State of the Union . What's next . On Wednesday, Remsburg turned 31. To celebrate his birthday, he took a tandem skydiving jump; his first since his injury. He's also working with a therapy dog that will help him do some of the things he can no longer do for himself. He says his heroes are his Army Ranger buddies who gave their lives serving their country. He wears a bracelet engraved with their names as a reminder of their ultimate sacrifice. His long-term goals are to go to college, get married and have children, to live a full life, just like anyone else. Opinion: Veterans shouldn't politicize the honoring of a fellow vet .

"(CNN) -- When former Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill first went to Brazil after coining the acronym BRIC, someone asked him whether he had included the ""B"" just to make the name sound good. Such skepticism is becoming common again, as investors compare the projected rate of growth in Brazil this year -- just 3% -- to that in China and India, around 8% and 6% respectively. So does Brazil still deserve to be seen as an economic powerhouse? Many would say no. Brazil grew by less than 1% in 2012, the lowest of the BRIC countries, and only 2.7% in 2011. Its problems are well known. It saves less than it invests, and 70% of its growth comes from consumption. Credit has risen dramatically over the last few years, but many families are now heavily indebted, which slows growth. Read more: Rising Brazil tackles immigration question . Over the last ten years Brazil has benefited from a commodity boom, but that boom is slowing. Brazil has become an expensive country, with a strong currency, and that has eroded the competitiveness of its industry. Ten years ago around 50% of exports were manufactured goods; today the proportion is closer to 35%. The tax burden is heavy, at around 35% of GDP, especially in comparison to the quality of services the state provides, and government spending is rising faster than GDP. Brazil's productivity grew by only 1.3% between 1990 and 2010, while China led the way at 8.3%, followed by India at 4.7% over the same period. Read more: WTO: Emerging markets get the nod . There are other causes of concern. Inflation is pushing right up against the Central Bank's ceiling of 6.5% per year. The balance of payments deficit is rising. Infrastructure such as ports, roads, and airports is poor, and attempts to bring in the private sector to modernize some of it, such as with airports, have not been entirely successful. Expensive electricity, an inadequately funded public sector pension system, and high interest rates round out this negative picture. Read more: Building on 'BRICS': The next emerging economies . According to some analysts, the fundamental pillars of the Brazilian economy are being eroded. The political system seems incapable of responding to these challenges. The state's bureaucratic machinery is cumbersome and antiquated; corruption is rife among politicians, and effective opposition to and debate about current policies almost non-existent. The current government is planning for president Dilma Rousseff's re-election in 2014 and there is a danger that it will postpone necessary adjustments, making a bad situation worse. So should we be talking about the RIC rather than BRIC countries? Not really. There are three main sets of reasons why it is too early to count Brazil out as a global economic player. The first has to do with fundamentals of its economy that are often ignored by short-term investors. Brazil's economy has a higher per capita GDP than both China and India, and as a more mature economy, it is not surprising that its growth rate is slower. Read more: Mixing sushi and samba - meet the Japanese Brazilians . More importantly, the country is much less vulnerable to external shocks than it used to be. Public debt as a percentage of GDP declined from about 60% to 35% of GDP between 2002 and 2012. International reserves are now $377 billion. Brazil attracted around $62 billion in foreign direct investment in 2012, making it the largest recipient of FDI in the world after China and the United States. All of these factors are reasons to be confident in the capacity of the Brazilian economy to continue to advance in an unspectacular but steady fashion. Second, Brazil has a number of enviable attributes. It has few threats to its security, meaning that it can afford to spend relatively little on national defence. Brazil is alone among the BRIC countries in not possessing nuclear weapons. Read more: Brazil competes with China, India to invest in Africa . Brazil also has a generous land to people ratio, with a large basket of natural resources, including petroleum, for a population that is relatively small (200 million) compared to China and India. It boasts a world-class agricultural sector that has not yet reached its potential. Already the largest producer in the world of soy and beef, it has the capacity to adapt more crops to its tropical soils and develop its vast land frontier. In addition, Brazil is becoming an environmental leader. Its management of the Amazon rainforest is crucial to the health of the planet, which is why the recent large reduction in the rate of deforestation has been so encouraging. It has some of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world. Almost half of all energy coming from renewable sources, mainly hydroelectric but also biofuels. There is a third and final set of factors that make Brazil stand out. Together with Russia, and unlike China and India, Brazil has reduced economic inequality in recent years. Its Gini index, a measure of income inequality, dropped from 0.63 to 0.52 from 1989 to 2009. Between 2003 and 2011, about 30 million Brazilians joined the so-called ""new middle class,"" earning between GBP100 and GBP400 per capita per month, and gaining access to formal sector employment, credit, and the country's large consumer market. This reduction in inequality has a racial component, because 75% of the new middle class is non-white. It also has a gender component -- formal sector employment for females has increased 136% in the last twenty years. It is true that Brazil's rate of economic growth is slow compared to China and India. But so are the growth rates of most countries. Brazil tends to be the focus of exaggerated analyses of its economy. If one looks past the superficial concern about growth at Brazil's economic fundamentals, its resources, and the extraordinary social progress that the country has made in recent decades, it seems premature to remove the ""B"" from BRIC. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony Pereira.","Many are asking if Brazil deserves to be seen as an economic powerhouse given its weak growth .
Over the last ten years Brazil has benefited from a commodity boom, but that boom is slowing .
The political system seems incapable of responding to these challenges .
But it may be too early to count Brazil out of the BRIC club, Anthony Pereira argues ."
"(EW.com) -- Juan Pablo's time as ""The Bachelor"" has finally come to a close, and despite the season's weird and fairly unsatisfactory ending, it actually provided us with a few solid ""Bachelorette"" options. If I'm being honest, my first choice for the next ""Bachelorette"" was single mother Renee, a.k.a. the most refreshingly normal ""Bachelor"" contestant in the show's history. But after she revealed her current ""situation"" of happiness during the ""Women Tell All"" special, I jumped to my second choice: Andi. That being said, I also would've watched a season that followed the adventures of Kelly and Molly, and after last night's finale, I actually wouldn't mind watching Clare search for love. (Yes, I said it.) And lastly, Sharleen is just so weird that I'd watch her season as well. 'The Bachelorette': See full coverage . But as we all learned last night, Andi Dorfman is the lucky lady about to embark on her own adventure to find love (and a worthwhile visit to the fantasy suite). Some people love the choice â€” me â€” and others hate it. Then there are those who just don't know what to expect. Here's how I think Andi's season will unfold (and why it will be entertaining to watch): . Ali, meet DeAnna: For starters, if I had to compare Andi to previous ""Bachelorettes,"" I'd say we can expect something along the lines of a mix between Ali Fedotowsky and DeAnna Pappas. Andi is smart, and she seems to have her feet planted firmly on the ground. Most importantly, she's also very strong. Honestly, leaving Juan Pablo post-fantasy suite is one of the reasons I like her so much. She knows what she wants, or at least what she doesn't want, and she's not hesitant to act on that. I keep thinking back to that time Ali all but chased Jonathan down until he would confront her about having a girlfriend back home. Ali wasn't taking any crap, and I think Andi will approach this season in the same way. 'The Bachelor': See full coverage . No more drama (for the most part): From what we've seen of Andi's fun side, she's got a great sense of humor. What I liked most about her relationship with Juan Pablo early on was how they made fun of each other. And we can also assess her personality from the fact that all the women in the house seemed to love her. The only drama surrounding Andi involved her decision to leave, which was valid. Papa Dorfman for the win: But let's not forget the thing that's going to play a big role in her season: Her father. Confession time? I love Andi's dad. He was the perfect mix of total softie and tough guy. I cannot wait for Andi to introduce these new fellas to her family. Andi-isms: Looking back on Juan Pablo's season, I love that Andi was the girl who brought a one-piece to the house. She's also the girl who brought Juan Pablo to a shooting range. No matter what, she's going to be herself, and she genuinely doesn't seem to be on television for the press â€” she's an attorney, for goodness sake. Horrible dancing: You know that some guy is going to make her dance with him, and we all know how awful (yet charming) that will be. Honestly, I think Andi is the type of person I would be friends with. I think she's relatively easygoing, and I am going to thoroughly enjoy watching her facial expressions when, inevitably, some guy tries to win her over with a cheesy line or a striptease or something. All in all, I foresee it being a normal, perfectly pleasant season ... so long as she doesn't slowly start offending the entire country with off-camera conversations.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea returned to the top of the English Premier League on Saturday, but it gave manager Jose Mourinho little hope that his side can win the title. The Portuguese, who was triumphant in the first two seasons of his first spell at the London club, remains adamant that Manchester City still hold the advantage. Chelsea's 3-0 win over Stoke put Mourinho's team a point above Liverpool, who travel to West Ham on Sunday, with City another point back after a similarly comprehensive 4-1 victory against eighth-placed Southampton earlier Saturday. Manuel Pellegrini's team, who have already won the English League Cup, have two games in hand on Chelsea. ""We have five matches to play in the Premier League and we have to try to win all five,"" said Mourinho, who returned to Stamford Bridge last year after leaving Real Madrid. ""We don't depend on ourselves and we never did. I was waiting for the moment where we could be top of the league and depend on ourselves and I was waiting for that moment to say, 'Yes, now, we are candidates because we depend on ourselves,' but that never happened. ""With Liverpool we have to play against them, so we have one match we have three points to discuss with them -- with Manchester City we do not play so they have their destiny in their hands and the only thing we can do is to continue to win matches."" Egypt winger Mohammed Salah gave Chelsea the lead in his first start since signing in January, then won a penalty from which Frank Lampard followed up his own saved attempt to net his 250th career goal. Brazil midfielder Willian wrapped up the win with 18 minutes left. While Chelsea may still be involved in the Champions League, albeit nursing wounds after a 3-1 defeat away to Paris Saint-Germain in midweek, City's focus remains on a second domestic title in three seasons. ""We are enjoying a very good second round of fixtures where the results are much better than the first half,"" Pellegrini said after City moved six points clear of fourth-placed Arsenal. ""We've had four wins and one draw in our last five games -- maybe we had low performances in the month of February and at the start of March but I think that now the team has come back to its best performances."" Manchester United moved up to sixth place with a 4-0 win at Newcastle, but Tottenham could reclaim that position from the defending champion by beating bottom club Sunderland on Monday. Former Chelsea star Juan Mata scored twice for United, who face Bayern Munich in the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinals on Wednesday, while Mexico striker Javier Hernandez and Adnan Januzaj also netted. It lifted more pressure off manager David Moyes, who rested several key players following his team's 1-1 draw with European champions Bayern in the midweek home leg. ""The focus could only be on this game but you could see we've left a few players at home and not played a few players, and we are hoping they will be fit for Wednesday night's game at Bayern Munich,"" he said. Fulham moved off the bottom of the table with a 2-1 win at Aston Villa, who were missing top scorer Christian Benteke due to an injury that rules the Belgium striker out of the World Cup. West Brom grabbed a crucial 1-0 win at Norwich that put both clubs level, five points above the relegation zone. Hull moved up to 12th with a 1-0 win over Swansea that left the Welsh team in a nervous position above the bottom five. Crystal Palace moved up to 14th with a 3-0 win at second-bottom Cardiff.","Jose Mourinho plays down Chelsea's chances of winning English title .

"(CNN) -- His hashtag said it all: not a good idea. Steve-O, best known for his grimace-inducing stunts on the ""Jackass"" TV show and films, was in San Antonio this weekend and flipped out. Literally. A photo shared on Facebook some 7,000 times (a related video got over 10,000 shares) shows the wild man in mid-leap. ""I did a good deed today by proving it's not safe to jump off the bridge at the San Antonio River Walk,"" he wrote. ""It's shallow â€” I hit the bottom when I landed this gainer flip. #notagoodidea"" Not safe because the water is only about 4 feet deep. It's also illegal. City statutes forbid anyone jumping into or swimming in the San Antonio River. Doing so can mean a $500 fine. San Antonio Police Sgt. Javier Salazar said authorities are looking into the incident ""to determine the appropriate course of action."" It's not clear if the entertainer will have to open up his wallet. Maybe he should consider himself lucky by walking away from the river stunt. ""It's all fun and games until you shatter the bottom of your legs,"" wrote one fan on his Facebook page. Another chiming in: ""Wouldn't you check how deep the water is first?"" Apparently not. Steve-O told the Houston Chronicle he ""had no idea the water was only four feet deep when I jumped off this bridge."" Later, he issued a statement blaming city officials for being ""quite irresponsible in neglecting to post 'no diving' signs on the various bridges along the river."" ""They've given no indication that people shouldn't jump, and done nothing to warn anyone about the serious dangers of that shallow water,"" Steve-O said. ""Very irresponsible, indeed."" The actor/daredevil added that authorities should be thanking, not investigating, him for his jump. ""I think they should be thanking me for informing people, rather than wasting their citizens' time and money trying to vilify me,"" he said. Although he has thrilled and disgusted audiences with low-brow antics, in recent years Steve-O has showed a more thoughtful side. Last year, he talked to HLN's Jane Velez Mitchell about his involvement in a documentary about farm animals and his recent decision to go vegan and get sober. But it's not all high brow. Just three days before his San Antonio plunge, Steve-O posted an Instagram video of a throwback stunt with striking similarities. ""Back in 1996, I did a flip off a building into 4 feet of water while it was snowing, and landed on my face,"" he wrote ""#yeahdude.""

"(CNN) -- In American politics, there is strength in numbers. When enough people feel a vested interest in the survival of a program, it becomes extraordinarily difficult for opponents to dismantle it. Obamacare, officially the Affordable Care Act, looks like it has just reached a critical tipping point. While the program still faces many challenges and numerous Republicans remained determined to keep attacking, the news that 7 million people have enrolled through the health care exchanges is a big victory for President Barack Obama and his supporters. Medicaid enrollment rose by 3 million people, much of which is a result of ACA as well. Rather than Obamacare being an abstract promise to Americans that will be fulfilled in the distant future, now the Affordable Care Act is a concrete program upon which millions of American voters will be depending. As that number increases, opponents of ACA will be going after the benefits of many millions of Americans -- not just the President. There is a long history of government programs securing their political strength through sheer numbers. Although Social Security remained a problematic and controversial program between 1935 and 1950 -- with some officials wondering whether it would even survive -- by the time that Dwight Eisenhower was President, there were fewer legislators willing to express such doubts. The reason was simple. Democratic and Republican legislators found their districts inhabited by elderly Americans who counted on these government pensions and workers who were paying payroll taxes. This is why legislators would increase benefits every election year. Agricultural supports have been equally strong since being put into place during the Great Depression. As farmers, farms and the entire agricultural industry came to depend on federal government assistance to ensure that prices remained stable, legislators shied away from trying to fix the program. Even legislators who represented urban districts had little interest in angering powerful rural representatives and senators whose constituents would not tolerate anyone tampering with their programs. When Eisenhower's Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson went after the program, Republicans suffered. ""Ezra Taft Benson,"" one reporter said when covering the 1954 midterm elections, ""has become the [Democrats'] fall guy, replacing the tired image of Herbert Hoover."" In the years before Congress passed Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, opponents -- including powerful voices in the health insurance industry and the American Medical Association -- railed against the plan as ""socialized medicine"" that would empower the government to make all the decisions doctors had once had control over. But President Lyndon Johnson and the Democratic Congress overcame their opposition to put into place these two major domestic programs. By the 1970s, serious opposition fell away. Doctors were depending on Medicare to fund their patients. Hospitals and states were planning on the Medicaid budget to keep their health systems going. And elderly patients no longer suffered the risk of not being able to seek treatment in their old age. As a result, nobody really wanted to get rid of these programs. Although there were fights to reform Medicare's regulatory structure and to cut costs since the 1980s, the strength of the programs has been formidable. There has been, thus far, little possibility that either would be scrapped. The same has been true for defense spending. The surge of military contracts in Southern and Western states during the 1940s and 1950s became a staple to the economic success of the Sunbelt. There are many reasons why defense spending is hard to retrench, but most important is the huge number of people who will vote and lobby against you if you take a step in this direction. ACA is now starting to reach this same territory. For this reason alone, it makes sense that Obama is smiling. While the program does not have the tens of millions of people who are in the Medicare or Social Security programs, the numbers are growing. ACA will continue to face political attacks and implementation challenges, but the enrollment level virtually ensures serious debates over repealing ACA are now dead.","More than 7 million people have signed up for Affordable Care Act coverage .

"(CNN) -- In your lifetime, you will send thousands, maybe millions of online messages. But what if you could only send one more? In China, where superstitions surrounding death are rife, new websites let Internet users leave digital imprints even after they pass away. One service is called ""Life Black Box"" and the idea is simple: You sign up and upload whatever you want -- be it secret photos, random thoughts, sensitive files, or final goodbyes. When you die, the website sends your data to people you've chosen. Li Jia, the creator of the Life Black Box, said he thought of the idea in 2010, when he was on an extremely turbulent plane ride. ""I had recently divorced -- and I realized I had a lot to say to my ex-wife, my son, and my parents,"" he told China's TechWeb. Last week, during China's annual Qingming festival to honor deceased ancestors, his website became a trending topic on Chinese social media amid widespread reflection over the missing Malaysia Airlines airliner. ""The Malaysia Airlines incident made us remember life is precious,"" wrote one microblog user. ""If one day, your life is coming to an abrupt end, will you have any regrets? We should create online wills; it's emotional sustenance."" Other microbloggers said the recent Kunming railroad station terrorist attack and Changsha market knife attack also made them consider signing up for the Black Box. Li said his website now has 360,000 registered users. Many have jobs that are dangerous or require constant traveling, and a great number are in their thirties or forties. According to TechWeb, over 28,000 online wills have been created in Jiangsu province, where 14 Flight 370 passengers are from. In another twist, employees at the Life Black Box website said 31 people on the missing jet's passenger list matched the names of its subscribers. But a spokesperson for the website told CNN no links have been confirmed, as many Chinese people have the same names. Virtual graves . Yet Black Box is not the only Chinese website that attempts to deal with death. One website called Waheaven, which says it has over three million users, lets users create online memorials by uploading images of their deceased ancestors, after which they can pay traditional tribute by lighting virtual incense or laying virtual flowers. Another Chinese memorial site calls itself a ""virtual home"" for dead spirits, and lets users pay blessings to anyone from Princess Diana to Genghis Khan. But the most melancholy may be the ""Last Post"" project, by Chinese social media user Lin Dongping. Since 2011, Lin has run a popular microblog account where he reposts final messages from ordinary people who have passed away. So far, he has already compiled stories of over 1,500 deaths. After each story, thousands of users, many of them strangers, leave tributes and well wishes in the comments. A 30-year-old reporter, dying of cancer, wrote in her last tweet, ""The operation ended... I couldn't even have porridge or water for six days... this is one of the greatest tortures i have experienced."" Another user posted a suicide note. ""I'm depressed, so I'm just going to die. No big reason. Don't care too much. Bye bye."" Over 294,000 people replied, many of them simply saying ""Rest in peace."" Digital afterlives . For today's Internet users, death raises a set of interesting new questions: What happens to our data when we're gone? Will anyone save our imprint, or will our virtual lives fade into digital dust? Lin said his goal is to honor the memory of the dead, no matter their stories. ""When people die, digital information is their legacy,"" said Lin in a TEDx talk. ""I'm just doing the work of a monk performing a funeral rite."" In the end, services like Life Black Box and ""Last Post"" seem to say that even in death, we don't have to be alone. On Lin's microblog, one final post, from a 17-year-old Chinese teen who ultimately died of cancer, was addressed to his younger sister. ""Please remember -- no matter how long you go without hearing from me, I will always give you faith, hope, and love."" CNN's Zoe Li in Hong Kong, and CNN Beijing interns Lucrezia Seu, Qi Zhang, and Andi Wang contributed reporting.","In China, new websites let Internet users leave digital imprints after death .

"(CNN) -- FX's Cold War drama ""The Americans"" is about to blow its cover. After quietly spending its first season in 2013 flying under the radar, this spy series is poised to be exposed as the discriminating TV fan's favorite addiction. On the surface, the '80s-set series from Joe Weisberg is pretty straightforward: two KGB agents, played by Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys, pose as a mild-mannered married couple with two kids in the suburbs of Washington during the Reagan administration. No one knows what these two are actually doing when they're working at their ""travel agency,"" and that includes their two children, teenager Paige (Holly Taylor) and her younger brother, Henry (Keidrich Sellati). The potential for plot twists alone would seem reason enough to watch, but what's kept viewers glued to their sets is the series' complexity. ""The Americans"" has heart-racing suspense, but also high-minded reflections on the politics of love, marriage and loyalty. So, after a nine-month hiatus, we're more than ready to welcome back FX's weekly dose of espionage, '80s pop culture and Cold War killing. And with its second season, ""The Americans"" is going to have a tender twist: a focus on love and family amid the thrills and intrigue. When last we saw our Russian spies-next-door, Russell and Rhys' Elizabeth and Philip Jennings, they'd narrowly escaped a trap set by their neighbor, FBI agent Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich). The new season picks up with Elizabeth and Philip, who've had a rocky relationship to say the least, reuniting at their home with heightened sensitivity for keeping their children safe from their deadly lifestyle. There are so many questions to answer: Will the Jennings kids learn the awful truth about their parents? Can Philip and Elizabeth make their bizarre marriage -- created under the guise of accomplishing a mission and now something more -- work out? And what about Beeman, who's still clueless that his neighbors are the spies he's been chasing with a passion? In honor of the return of ""The Americans,"" we give you five reasons to put it on your TV surveillance list: . Best excuse to ""do laundry in the middle of the night"" In season one, the laundry room was the perfect cover for Elizabeth and Philip's KGB operation. But the Jennings' daughter Paige is getting older â€” and savvier. She's starting to notice her mom and dad are spending a little too much time ""doing laundry"" in the basement. If she snoops too much, she might uncover her parents' secret stash of spy gear. Oops! (How do you think they'll be able to explain THAT? ""Honey, do you know what a 'license to kill' is?"") More wigs than a Dolly Parton concert . Let's put aside the show's reputation as a critical standout and focus on its notoriously bad wig collection. With this being a show about spies, the ridiculous disguises come in spades. It seems like every episode offers a fantastic excuse to trot out a spectacular set of fake teeth, false mustaches and dyed hair. There are so many different combinations, Rhys has even picked a favorite. ""I've named him; he's called Fernando. He has longish hair. We actually saw him in the first episode of the first season when he beat up someone who was being rather lascivious with his daughter at a department store,"" he told reporters during a recent conference call. ""He has, like, a mustache and long hair and a little goatee, and he feels very Latin to me."" Dear show runners: Please keep 'em coming! Best show with spouses who have an understanding about on-the-job sex . It must be hard for Philip and Elizabeth to fix their marriage while they're both having sex with their sources. Or, for that matter, when they're tying the knot with them. (Hey, whatever it takes to defend the Motherland!) In season 2, Philip's ""marriage"" to FBI administrative assistant Martha Hanson (Alison Wright) is making his life even more complicated. ""They plant such a beautiful seed of conflict within Elizabeth,"" Rhys said. ""She's been this stalwart, this hardline, hard-nosed agent for so long, who's still incredibly loyal to the cause, (and now) she has this great enormous struggle within her where she realizes that she has these feelings for Philip. ... (As) a device it's rather fantastic, but it certainly takes its toll on the relationship."" Best show with multiple 1980s pop culture references . Is it wrong if we secretly hope that ""The Americans"" does for the '80s what ""Mad Men"" has done for the '60s? From leg-warmers to high-waisted jeans to an '80s soundtrack, we love this show's playpen of anachronisms. This season, look for references to a real-life relationship guru, excellent movies on VHS and a new Soviet spy who loves rockers like Rod Stewart and Blondie. Best timing EVER for the season premiere of a Cold War drama . We don't think FX's marketing team could have possibly thought up a better coincidence. The new season just so happens to kick off while U.S-Russian tensions have been on the rise. CNN's own Political Ticker had to double-check its calendar the other day while asking, ""The Cold War is over. Right?"" If that's not enough, here's a secret sixth reason: The writers have set up a carefully layered examination of human behavior that is teetering on the edge of disaster, not unlike a table of human dominoes. When the first one falls, it should be deliciously fun to watch.","FX's Cold War drama ""The Americans"" returns February 26 .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton led a Mercedes one-two at the Malaysian Grand Prix Sunday then dedicated his victory to the families and presumed victims of missing flight MH370. ""I just feel so grateful, particularly after the tragedy three weeks ago and I would like to dedicate the win to the families,"" said the Briton on the victory podium at Sepang. The mystery surrounding the Malaysian Airlines flight cast a shadow over the race, with the circuit only a short drive from the international airport in Kuala Lumpur. A minute's silence, led by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone, was observed before the start, while drivers wore helmet stickers reading ""Pray for MH370"". When the action started, Hamilton swiftly took advantage of pole position to win by 17 seconds from teammate Nico Rosberg, with reigning four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel in a distant third for Red Bull. Rosberg, who won the season-opener in Australia where a technical fault scuppered Hamilton's chances, extended his lead in the title race with his solid drive, racing past Vettel from third on the grid. ""I got a great start today, "" said the German, who is the son of 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg. ""I was trying to chase Lewis but he was just too quick for me today."" While Vettel was satisfied with his third place, his teammate Daniel Ricciardo suffered a sorry race with a series of technical problems forcing him to retire. It continued the misfortune for Australian Ricciardo, who took second in his home grand prix in Melbourne, but was subsequently disqualified for breaking regulations regarding fuel use. It left two-time world champion Fernando Alonso in fourth for Ferrari ahead of Force India's Nico Hulkenberg, with Jenson Button sixth in his McLaren. Williams drivers Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas were seventh and eighth while Button's teammate Kevin Magnussen and Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat completed the points scoring. Only 15 drivers were classified as the teams continue to get to grips with the new cars in Formula One, which use 1.6-litre V6 turbo-charged power units. Mercedes has been consistently quickest in pre-season testing and the opening two races of the season and will be looking to take further advantage at next week's Bahrain round. Rosberg leads Hamilton by 18 points in the standings, with Alonso a point further back. Vettel, who was forced to retire in Australia, claimed his first points of the season in Malaysia, but knows his former all-conquering team are playing catch up. ""At the end I was just trying to get the car home. There's still a long way to go -- the Mercedes cars are quick,"" he admitted. 2008 champion, Hamilton, who was ending an eight-month victory drought, had served notice of his superiority by pipping Vettel to pole in Saturday's rain-hit qualifying session. Forecasts that Sunday's race would be affected by poor weather proved wide of the mark, with only a few spots of rain falling in the latter stages of the 56 laps.","Lewis Hamilton wins Malaysian Grand Prix .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A 2004 crash that killed everyone on board -- three crew members and three U.S. troops -- was caused by pilots from a Blackwater plane taking a low-level run through a mountain canyon in Afghanistan, testimony revealed Tuesday. A twin-engine CASA C-212, similar to the plane pictured, crashed in 2004, killing all six on board. ""I swear to God, they wouldn't pay me if they knew how much fun this was,"" the doomed plane's cockpit voice recorder captured the pilot saying shortly before the November 27, 2004, crash. The account of the crash emerged during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Blackwater's performance in Iraq and Afghanistan. In its November 2006 report on the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Blackwater provided insufficient oversight and guidance of the pilots involved in the 2004 crash. Dispatchers failed to ensure that pilots followed their flight plan and did not adequately track flights in the air. The NTSB said the military ""did not provide adequate oversight of the contract carrier's operations in Afghanistan."" The company's chairman, Erik Prince, appeared before the committee to defend the firm Tuesday. The twin-engine CASA C-212, a light cargo plane operated by Blackwater sister company Presidential Airways, crashed in a box canyon well off its planned route from Bagram Air Base to the western Afghan town of Shindand. ""You're an X-wing fighter Star Wars man,"" an NTSB report quoted the plane's co-pilot, Loren Hammer, saying during the flight -- a reference to the dizzying battle in the 1977 film. ""You're [expletive] right. This is fun,"" the pilot, Noel English, responded. About eight minutes later, the plane slammed into the wall of the canyon, which was flanked by ridgelines that rose nearly a mile above surrounding terrain. When rescuers found the wreckage three days later, they discovered one of the passengers had survived the crash only to die of internal bleeding and exposure, the NTSB found. When an unidentified passenger asked about the plane's route before the crash, flight mechanic Melvin Rowe told him, ""I don't know what we're gonna see. We don't normally go this route."" English added, ""All we want is to avoid seeing rock at 12 o'clock."" English and Hammer had been in Afghanistan less than two weeks, the NTSB found. Federal investigators found each should have been paired with a more experienced aviator, according to Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California. Waxman is chairman of the oversight committee, which is investigating Blackwater's performance on more than $1 billion in U.S. government contracts since 2001. He said a company e-mail stated the company had overlooked experience requirements ""in favor of getting the requisite number of personnel on board to start up the contract."" ""The corporation hired inexperienced pilots. They sent them on a route they didn't know about,"" Waxman said. ""It seems to me that it's more than pilot error. There ought to be corporate responsibility, and Blackwater was the corporation involved."" Prince said investigators concluded the crash in Afghanistan was not due to corporate error, but pilot error. He rejected Waxman's contention that the pilots ""acted like cowboys."" ""We provided thousands and thousands of flight hours of arrival service since then,"" Prince said. ""Today, still, we're flying more than a thousand missions a month."" Passengers on the flight included Lt. Col. Michael McMahon, the commander of a Hawaii-based Army aviation battalion; and two members of his unit, Chief Warrant Officer Travis Grogan, and Spc. Harley Miller. In a letter read to the committee, McMahon's widow, Col. Jeannette McMahon, wrote the accident was the result of a ""gross lack of judgment in managing this company."" Her husband's unit had a great safety record, she wrote: ""It's ironic and unfortunate that he had to be a passenger on this plane versus one of the people responsible for its safe operation."" The families of the passengers have filed suit against Presidential Airways and its related firms. Blackwater's effort to dismiss the case is before a federal appeals court in Atlanta, plaintiff's lawyer Robert Spohrer said. The company has come under scrutiny over its work in Iraq, where government officials accuse its contractors of killing as many as 20 civilians in a September clash in Baghdad. The Defense Department hired Blackwater to fly cargo to sites in Afghanistan, where larger transports are unable to take off or land. Prince described the job as ""rugged, Alaska-style bush flying."" And he said the military violated its own regulations by flying 400 pounds of 81mm mortar rounds along with the passengers and gear.

"(CNN) -- It was a record some thought would never be broken: Sergey Bubka's mark in the pole vault. But Frenchman Renaud Lavillenie -- with Bubka cheering him on -- did the almost unthinkable by bettering Bubka in the latter's hometown of Donetsk in Ukraine. Lavillenie cleared a height of 6.16 meters, surpassing the 6.15 meters Bubka achieved in 1993 on nearly the same day in February. ""I think it's going to take me some time to come back to earth because it's incredible,"" Lavillenie, the reigning Olympic and European champion, was quoted as saying by the IAAF's website. ""This is a world record that is so mythical, and to clear it on the first jump, without touching (the bar), there's nothing to say. It's just a moment to savor."" Bubka had no issue with being upstaged. ""I think this is a great day, a fantastic performance, I am very happy that Renaud did this record in my home city where I did 6.15,"" Bubka was quoted as saying by the IAAF. ""I'm very happy and proud for him, because he's a great athlete and a fantastic role model. ""I'm not disappointed because I thought this already before, even yesterday when we had a discussion about the record with Renaud.

"New York (CNN) -- An SUV driver whose beating at the hands of a group of bikers was captured on video has filed a legal notice of his intent to sue the city of New York and off-duty police officers allegedly involved in the attack, the city's legal department said Saturday. The man, Alexian Lien, alleges that the city was negligent in the hiring and training of its police officers and claims that it failed ""to respond to a known danger,"" according to the documents. Lien was driving on a Manhattan highway with his wife and 2-year-old daughter on September 29 when his SUV was surrounded by bikers who tried to get him to stop, video taken at the scene showed. Lien drove away, but the bikers later caught up to him in traffic, according to police. Video showed a man later identified as Lien being dragged out of the vehicle by some of the bikers, who used their helmets to attack him and kicked his head and body as he lay on the ground. Lien suffered two black eyes and cuts on his face and side, requiring stitches, police said. Lien was attacked by an ""unruly mob of motorcycle riders,"" according to the documents. His alleged attackers included police officers, prosecutors said. In the claim, Lien names two officers, including Wojceich Braszczok, who was charged with first-degree gang assault and first-degree assault -- both felonies -- and third-degree criminal mischief in connection with the assault. Calls to Braszczok's attorney were not returned. Lien's wife, Rosalyn Ng, and his daughter also appear as claimants. They are seeking more than $75,000 each in damages. Police said Lien was chased by the bikers after his vehicle bumped one during a bike rally. When his Range Rover was surrounded by several bikers, Lien called 911, told police he feared for his life and drove off. The SUV ran over some of the bikers and critically injured one before being overtaken. Lien was treated and released from a hospital after the incident. He was not charged. Eleven people were indicted on assault and other charges for the attack. Court appearances are scheduled for late February. Calls to Lien's attorney were not returned.","Alexian Lien was attacked September 29 on a Manhattan street .

"(CNN) -- Facebook's $2 billion purchase of startup Oculus, which makes virtual reality headsets, is bad news for small investors and Silicon Valley's innovation ecology. The deal means we will never have the chance to own Oculus stock. This is the latest instance of a shift in the tech sector that reduces would-be investors to mere consumers. For decades, Silicon Valley's culture was built around small startups that counted on ""going public"" -- listing their shares in an initial public offering. The resulting IPO provided working capital to the founders and allowed ordinary investors to buy into the dream -- and prospect of a financial upside. Microsoft, Amazon, Yahoo and Google and others went this route. Ordinary investors could participate by holding a stake in the companies they liked. This also made it possible for a steady stream of tech upstarts to grow into independent tech giants with diverse products and services. Early employees at successful startups would then use their new-IPO wealth to depart and launch the next wave of companies. This IPO model began to erode after the dot-com bubble burst when the market became riskier. At the same time, the dot-com survivors were increasingly flush with cash and in an arms race to ensure growth. Buying early-stage companies was an easy way to gather new technologies, businesses, patents -- and top-notch entrepreneurial brains. The shift came into sharp focus in 2006 when Google bought YouTube. Founded by three PayPal employees in 2005, YouTube was less than two years old when Google paid the then-unheard sum of $1.65 billion to turn it into a Google subsidiary. This was good news for Google, but we will never know what YouTube might have become had it remained independent. Sure, investors can participate by owning Google stock, but might YouTube stock have done even better if allowed to fly on its own? Grabbing companies before they go public also impoverishes the variety of products that come to market. Imagine if Apple had been acquired in the early 1980s during its infancy by IBM or Sony? Would there ever have been a Macintosh, iPod, iPhone or iPad? Now that Facebook owns Oculus, will it allow users to wear their goggles when visiting virtual worlds in Second Life or watch movies from Sony Pictures? With Nest -- acquired recently by Google for $3.2 billion -- will iPhone users get the same level of interaction with their home thermostat as Android users? While some companies like Amazon have shown remarkable restraint in allowing their acquired subsidiaries to operate independently, the temptation to tweak products for differential advantage is compelling, particularly when the price tag is in the billions of dollars. Instead of an eclectic field of many companies of all sizes, the new landscape is becoming dominated by a few goliaths whose cherry-picking among the small startups all but eliminates the population of mid-sized companies with significant future IPO and innovation potential. Worse yet, employees in the acquired startups who find themselves in secure, lavishly-paid positions at companies like Facebook are less likely to strike out on their own. And even if they do manage to break out and create a new company, their focus will be on the quick kill of getting acquired by a giant in a year or two, not on embarking on the multi-year road of creating a potentially world-changing product. The future of tech sector dominated by the acquisition trend reminds me of the final scene of the movie ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" After a nail-biting, continent-spanning race to find a mystical and vastly powerful artifact, the last the audience sees of the now boxed-up Ark is its disappearance into a vast warehouse of identical crates. We know the Ark will never see the light of day again and are left to wonder at what else might be hidden and gathering dust alongside it. In the case of Oculus, we might enjoy the immersive pleasure of head-mounted displays, but even that will not be enough to keep me from wondering what might have been if Oculus, Nest and all the other startups gobbled up by giants like Facebook and Google had been allowed to grow into independent companies owned by ordinary investors like you and me. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Saffo.","Paul Saffo: Facebook's $2 billion purchase of Oculus is a bad deal for consumers .

"(CNN) -- Paris is perpetually one of the world's most popular cities. And the 16 million tourists who travel to the home of La Tour Eiffel and the Louvre leave a whopping $17.8 billion behind during their trips, according to MasterCard's 2012 Global Destination Cities Index. While Paris isn't generally a place you go to save money, it can be done. Even in this pricey place, the clever traveler can track down activities, services and just plain pleasures that don't cost a single centime. Here's a list of 10 fabulous and free finds in the City of Light. Tour the city for free. Spend an hour or 90 minutes strolling city streets on free tours -- except for the voluntary tips you give -- with Parisian natives through Discover Walks. Held 363 days a year -- each day except December 24 and 25 -- these rain-or-shine, small-group tours show you the Right and Left Bank, Notre Dame, the hip-and-trendy Marais and the picturesque city village of Montmartre. Just show up ready to walk. You don't even have to book in advance unless you're bringing a group of eight or more. Soak up the organ sounds at Saint-Sulpice. Here's a favorite of ""Europe Through the Back Door"" travel guru and public television series host Rick Steves. The Left Bank church of Saint-Sulpice -- which gained fame thanks to its prominent role as a location in ""The Da Vinci Code"" -- has a pipe organ tradition dating back to the mid-16th century. Visitors can climb up a spiral staircase to the organ loft to meet multilingual virtuoso Daniel Roth after the 10:30 a.m. Sunday Mass and subsequent organ recital. Guests can watch this living legend play one of Europe's most majestic pipe organs during the 12:05 p.m. Mass. Amazing grace, indeed. Drink up -- at a sparkling water fountain. Leave it to Paris to create a public water tap -- inside a lovely park, no less -- with the bubbly stuff. For the past couple years, the Jardin de Reuilly in the city's southeast 12th arrondissement has been serving up cooled sparkling water to quench Parisian thirsts (available any time the park is open). The park's La Pétillante public fountain was the first in France to add carbon dioxide to the city's tap water, and locals lapped it up by bringing their own bottles to fill. You'd expect no less in the country that gave the world Perrier. On a clear day you can see ... Sure, you can climb to the top of the Arc de Triomphe or Eiffel Tower, but some of the City of Light's most stunning -- and free! -- views can be found from the roof terrace of the Left Bank's Institut du Monde Arabe. An über-modern, curved-façade facility designed by famed French architect Jean Nouvel, the Institut was founded by 18 Arab nations and France to take a multidisciplinary look at the Islamic Arab world. It allows visitors, whether or not they're visiting the Institut's recently revamped museum, library or bookshops, to take its glass elevator up to the ninth floor terrace. From here, gaze out at Notre Dame, the Centre Pompidou or the landmark column standing in Place de la Bastille. Under 26? Catch up on contemporary French art at MAC/VAL -- the Musée d'Art Contemporain du Val de Marne. Who says youth is wasted on the young? Not if they're lovers of contemporary art and artists like Christian Boltanski, Bruno Perramant and Gina Pane. Here, out in the 'burb of Vitry-sur-Seine, MAC/VAL offers visitors a range of French modern art from the 1950s through today. And if these visitors are under 26, they get to experience it all gratis (flash an ID to borrow a free audio guide). From established talent to emerging artists, you'll find them at MAC/VAL, which hosts three to four temporary exhibits each year. Look for the loos. Most folks don't get particularly psyched about toilets. But when they're the space-age, self-cleaning, pod-like gray structures dotting the Parisian streetscape, you just might. You'll find 400 of these disabled-accessible bathrooms scattered all around Paris (they're open between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.) near major tourist spots, food markets and taxi stands. Each time a visitor uses these ""sanisettes,"" the toilet bowl and floor are automatically cleaned, dried and disinfected -- and they contain coat hooks, a mirror and sink. And with natural roof lighting, reduced water use and renewable-source electricity, they're eco-friendly to boot. Mother Nature must be thrilled. Life's a beach (during the summer, at least). So what if the Seine River that snakes through Paris has no beach? This city is nothing if not inventive -- so Mayor Bertrand Delanoë spearheaded the creation of Paris Plages, man-made ""beaches"" that offer locals and tourists alike a ""Seine-side holiday"" each summer. Starting around July 20 and for four weeks after, the city closes the streets along the river, brings in tons of sand and palm trees and offers a slew of entertaining options from beach volleyball to kayaking to open-air concerts on three different ""beaches."" Of course, this being France, riverside cafés, restaurants and ice cream vendors are de rigueur. You'll have to wait 'til next year to take advantage of the next installment, but what a Parisian way to spend those dog days of summer, from 8 a.m. to midnight. Make it a museum. Just like museums in most world-class cities, many of those within Paris open themselves to visitors free of charge one day a week. In the City of Light, that's the first Sunday of each month. Save those euros for a few café au laits or souvenirs and check out the Louvre, the Musée d'Orsay and the Musée National Rodin (hello, The Thinker!), among others. Some, like the Musée Carnavalet, offer free admission to their permanent and themed collections each day. For those seeking a free dose of nighttime culture -- and who visit Paris in mid-May -- Nuit des Musées is just the ticket. Nearly 200 city museums keep their doors open during this one night from 6 p.m. until at least midnight. See Paris through local eyes. There's nothing like traipsing through a city with a local resident by your side. The Parisien d'Un Jour, Paris Greeter program, pairs city visitors with regular residents -- students, working people, retirees and others. These folks aren't formal guides or interpreters, just passionate Parisians willing to spend two or three hours walking with groups of six or fewer tourists, showing off their favorite areas and spots based on your interests and language. Just go online to register. (Paris Greeters welcome visitors with disabilities, too.) Got questions about navigating the Métro or Parisian quirks? Ask away. And while the service is free, the program happily accepts donations. Savor free sounds on Sunday. As it has since the early 1930s, the American Church in Paris has hosted the Atelier Concert Series, which offers a performance venue to musicians of diverse backgrounds and musical styles. Staged at the legendary Left Bank church every Sunday at 5 p.m. from September to November and January through June, music lovers will hear everything from classical pianists to opera singers to flute-and-guitar ensembles. Feel like giving thanks? Drop something in the voluntary offering at the door.

"(CNN) -- A stampede near a religious temple killed 100 people in southern India, authorities said. Pilgrims were returning from a Hindu ritual at a temple when a vehicle overturned, prompting the stampede, said Jai Kumar, home secretary of Kerala state. At least 14 people were injured. Video footage showed authorities loading up bodies in large pickup trucks. Onlookers gathered around, looking at the pile of bodies as some took pictures and sobbed. The incident occurred about 5 miles from the Sabarimala Temple, Kumar said. The vehicle struck many of the people in a narrow stretch through a forest, the news agency Press Trust of India reported. Stampedes at events in India have occurred several times because large crowds gather at narrow, congested areas. Last March, more than 60 people were killed during a stampede at a temple in the Uttar Pradesh state. CNN's Sumnima Udas contributed to this report.","NEW: Video footage shows stampede aftermath .

"Majuro, Marshall Islands (CNN) -- After showing signs of improvement, Jose Salvador Alvarenga's health has deteriorated. Alvarenga, who said he was lost at sea for 13 months, returned to a hospital Thursday to be intravenously fed, said Christian Clay-Mendoza, a top Mexican trade official. ""Doctors say he's severely dehydrated and low on vitamins and minerals,"" he said. Alvarenga, an El Salvadoran who had been living in Mexico, washed ashore on the Marshall Islands eight days ago. Earlier this week, his condition improved enough that he was released from a hospital. Doctors said Alvarenga's limbs have started to swell, and they can't seem to keep him hydrated. But he did manage to leave the hospital briefly Thursday to make a few comments to the media. Bewildered by all the cameras, he thanked the government and people of the Marshall Islands for their care and friendship. After his minute-long remark, officials whisked him back to the hospital. Plans for his repatriation to El Salvador on Friday have now been postponed due to his health. Official: His story 'is probable' Alvarenga's claims have garnered widespread skepticism about how he could survive for 13 months adrift on the Pacific. But from what officials can tell, they have no reason to doubt him. ""The investigations into Mr. Alvarenga's story so far have been substantiated,"" said Phillip Muller, the Marshall Islands' foreign affairs minister. Clay-Mendoza said Alvarenga was an undocumented worker in Mexico. But ""what he has said to us about his identity, so far, has been true."" ""We've had contact with his family in El Salvador, and they have corroborated his story,"" the Mexican official said. ""Now we are trying to contact his boss at the fishing co-op he belonged to in Mexico, but so far everything he's told us has jibed. The main question now is how long was he at sea?"" Clay-Mendoza said ""it's probable"" Alvarenga really did get lost at sea starting in December 2012. He said the boat was reported missing in 2012. If Alvarenga's story proves true, the trip across the Pacific would have taken him across roughly 6,600 miles (10,800 kilometers) of open ocean before ending in the Marshall Islands, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, in the northern Pacific. Officials: 'We gave up' trying to figure out how long castaway was adrift in Pacific . The other man . Alvarenga says he set off on a fishing trip from the port of Paredon Viejo, Mexico, near the southern coastal city of Tonala. He said he and another man intended to spend a day trying to catch sharks, but they were blown off course by winds and then got caught in a storm, eventually losing use of their engines. Bellarmino Rodriguez Beyz, the owner of Alvarenga's boat in Mexico, identified the fishing partner as 23-year-old Ezequiel Córdova. Alvarenga said that four weeks into their drift, his companion died of starvation because he refused to eat raw birds and turtles. Eventually, he threw the body overboard. ""What else could I do?"" Alvarenga said. Living on faith and fish . A grieving family . Back in the Mexican village of El Fortin, Córdova's family is inconsolable. More than a year after the young man went missing, his mother is grieving his death. ""The pain is so great, I can't explain it,"" Córdova's mother said. ""Losing a child is the hardest thing to bear in life."" Córdova's brother said the 23-year-old took care of his family -- and that's why he became a fisherman, in hopes of earning a better livelihood. ""My brother was kind, he was responsible for my mother,"" he said. ""In fact, he worked in the sea because of her. He wanted to improve himself. He didn't want to be poor, like us."" The fishing cooperative that Córdova and Alvarenga belonged to has about 45 boats, Rodriguez said. The fishermen make about $150 a week. But the waters near Paredon Viejo are notorious for the dangerous winds that can blow fishermen away. Now that Córdova's mother knows her son is dead, she wants answers. ""As a mother, I demand the authorities allow me to talk to the survivor,"" she said. ""Only in that way will I know what happened, and what he did with the body of my son. I deserve to know the truth. "" Meanwhile, Córdova's bedroom, scant with just a blanket as a headboard, remains untouched. Just the way he left it more than a year ago. This teen was adrift at sea for 26 days . Suzanne Chutaro and Jack Niedenthal reported from Majuro, Marshall Islands; Holly Yan reported from Atlanta. CNN's Nick Parker and Jethro Mullen also contributed to this report.","NEW: The mother of the dead fishing partner demands to speak with Alvarenga .

"(CNN) -- British tabloids have led a feeding frenzy of international media coverage that started weeks ahead of Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge's Australasian visit, but the New Zealand media have been slower to smell the blood. Local coverage of the celebrity couple's 10-day visit that starts April 7 has been respectful but largely reactive in its attempts to inspire the same degree of public adulation for British royalty last seen here 31 years ago. That was in 1983, when 10-month-old Prince William visited New Zealand for the first time with his parents Prince Charles and Princess Diana. The young prince was just a few weeks older then than his son Prince George will be on this visit. The lacklustre coverage is understandable given the absence of any real angles until the New Zealand leg of the Australasian tour actually begins and the international media scrum starts seriously jostling for saleable scoops. Other factors include the shrinking sizes of newsrooms and the fact that many of the royal stories run have been ""handed to the media on an official plate,"" as one senior editor put it. And, regardless of whether New Zealanders these days are royalists or republicans, they also have a strong distaste for the sensationalist diet of royal reporting the British are so used to being fed. Until this weekend, the biggest royal media story has been the furore following a former British protection officer's comments that the release of maps of public viewing points for the royal tour was effectively ""a manual for terrorists."" Newspapers, television and radio have otherwise been rolling out a steady stream of ""easy click"" soft stories and pretty photos, as much to score rating points as to genuinely slake the perceived thirst here for information about the ""it-couple"" whose international popularity is at an all-time high. Some editors quietly bemoan the fact that the ""easy words and easy pictures"" royal coverage is out of proportion to public interest which would be better served with more coverage of the upcoming budget, national elections and recently plummeting prices for the some of the country's main dairy export products. How much New Zealanders are really hankering to see the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their much adored eight-month-old George can't be accurately gauged until the crowds do, or don't, choke the streets. Either way, the media is prepared, on paper at least, for the trio who, royal roots aside, have attained pop star status, in particular in the United States. Official media briefings around the country have been full, and of the 450 media accredited to cover the tour, nearly three quarters are local. Editors planning nationwide radio, television and newspaper coverage as well as around-the-clock online and social media content are all throwing maximum resources at the tour. The commitment is, of course, as much about beaming stories and photos of the royals to the rest of the world as it is to satisfying New Zealand audiences. It is also a priceless opportunity to promote tourism by showcasing images of New Zealand's natural beauty along with those of the beautiful couple and the loveable third-in-line to the British throne. Fairfax Media, one of the country's two biggest media chains, will have staff at every royal event. ""That's not necessarily because its news. But if something went wrong, you have to be there,"" said Fairfax's national content editor, Kevin Norquay. Sources close to officials managing the royal visit say they are optimistically expecting ""a bit of hysteria."" During Prince William's first New Zealand visit, the sight of him being set loose to crawl on the lawns of Government House in Auckland with an iconic Kiwi Buzzy Bee toy touched people's hearts. When I covered that visit, there was still a collective sense of pride among most New Zealanders at welcoming members of ""our royal family"" whose mother and grandmother was ""our Queen."" When William, Kate and George visit this week, New Zealanders who choose to connect with them will do so on various levels, many of them with little regard for any loyalty to royalty. There is no doubt that an empathetic William endeared himself again to New Zealanders when he made a special trip here in 2011 to meet families of the victims of that year's devastating Christchurch earthquake and of the 2010 Pike River Coal Mine disaster. Public interest will be high in Kate who is visiting New Zealand for the first time on the couple's first official overseas visit with George. What could be more feel-good than a pretty, well-dressed ""princess"" toting her beautiful baby? A referendum within the next three years will decide whether New Zealanders will change their national flag, which has included Britain's Union Jack for more than 100 years. Public opposition to changing the flag has grown over the past few years to just over 50% of people polled, with half of those who were polled between the ages of 18 to 39 being opponents. New Zealand's indigenous people, the Maori, have always had a close connection with the British Royal Family, partly because of a historic and often abrogated treaty signed by Maori in the 19th century with representatives of Queen Victoria. This year, however, the Maori King has declined to see the Duke and Duchess because he believed their diary allowed too little time for traditional ritual. The crowds that turn out to catch a glimpse of the royals are likely to include a higher proportion of rubber-neckers, anti-royalists and people who just go ga-ga over good-looking, blue-blooded babies than of true-blue royalists.

"(Wired) -- Google's Street View images bear some similarities to 18th-century landscape paintings. The content is different, of course. What Google's army of photo collectors captured at Westminster Abbey on any given day in the 21st century will look different than what Italian painter Canaletto saw back in the 1700s. But they're both a representation of an exact moment in time, which makes them a handy way to compare now and then if you can isolate the right locations. Redditor Shystone has laid old paintings over Google Street View photographs to create a series of perspective-bending composite images of old and new London. Modern sculptures dominate a plaza that was once wide open; neon signs reside on the same block as gas-lit streetlights; and a bridge covers over a river that was once filled with sailboats. We've seen projects similar to this before, but it works particularly well in a city like London, where history is built into infrastructure and architecture. Buildings that existed in the 18th century are still standing today, which gives the images a ghostly feeling. It really is incredible how well paintings from artists like Canaletto and Balthazar Nebot reflect current-day London. It certainly helps that Shystone made sure to line up the edges of buildings and streets for maximum effect. Read more: The quality of 13 famous TV shows, charted over time . The most incredible part of these images is in the details. Look closely at Canaletto's 1749 painting of Westminster Abbey, and you'll see what looks like a painted tree in the upper lefthand side. This is not product of Canaletto's paintbrush, but rather a perfectly-aligned placement of the photograph Google shot more than 250 years later. It looks like it could be the same exact tree, though we know it's not. Still, it's fun to imagine that people have been stopping for shade under those very leaves for centuries. This idea then, is the coolest part of mash-ups like Shystone's: It makes you realize that despite all of the ways cities have changed over the years, maybe some things aren't really that different after all. Sure, the little girl standing in the middle of William Logsdail's 1888 painting of St. Martins in the Field maybe never existed, and if she did she has since been replaced with a bike lane and stop lights, but the general purpose of the space has remained essentially the same. Read more: How to create the perfect online dating profile, in 25 infographics . Then again, Shystone points to Balthazar Nebot's 1737 painting of Convent Green Market as an example of how a city does, in fact, evolve. ""When this square was originally built in the 1660s it was the first open piazza of its type in London. Pretty famous as a red light district by the time this was painted,"" he writes. ""Today this view east towards St. Paul's Church is taken up by the Market Hall that got built in 1830. There's a nice pub in the basement corner full of little cozy nooks. Gets pretty crowded.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A previously unreleased video of Michael Jackson's hair catching fire while filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984 was posted online by Us magazine Wednesday. Michael Jackson, shown here in the mid-'80s, was involved in a accident while filming a commercial. The onstage mishap 25 years ago, in which Jackson's scalp was burned, has been blamed for leading the entertainer to prescription pain medications. A publicist for Us magazine said the publication would not comment on how the video was obtained. The dramatic footage shows pyrotechnics exploding near Jackson and yellow flames immediately erupting on his black hair. The pop star continues to dance down stairs for about 10 seconds before stage hands rush to him to douse the fire that has covered his scalp. A bald spot is clearly seen at the top of Jackson's head as he stands up. Still wearing his trademark sequined glove, Jackson grabs his head with his hands as he is led offstage.  Watch the accident unfold » . Miko Brando, son of actor Marlon Brando and Jackson's close friend, was the first person seen reaching Jackson.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China in 1978 was stranded at a political crossroad. It was just emerging from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and the death of Chairman Mao. Deng Xiaoping had emerged as the new leader, but Mao's dogma remained deep-rooted and seemingly immutable. In and outside the Communist Party, a debate raged: Where to, China? CNN Beijing Bureau Chief Jaime FlorCruz worked on a farm in China's Hunan province during the 1970s. On December 18, 1978, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping gave his answer. In a Communist Party meeting in Beijing that day, the political elite adopted Deng's pragmatic program and launched economic reforms. New China was born. People paraded in the streets to celebrate. Families gathered around the dinner table, uncorked wine bottles and toasted each other. Thirty years hence, China's radical makeover is apparent. China now is nothing short of an economic miracle. Its economy has grown at an average of 9.8 percent since 1978, making it the fourth largest economy in the world. Incredibly, China has pulled off the equivalent of reform, renaissance and industrial revolution in 30 years.  Watch what Deng unleashed » . It's incredible because only three decades ago China was so poor and isolated. I saw it up close when I worked on a farm in Hunan province, Chairman Mao's hometown, not long after I first arrived in China in 1971. For several months, I worked there with a production team planting rice, picking tea leaves, feeding pigs and digging ditches. Farmers worked hard and lived Spartan lives. Once, I attended a meeting to honor model workers; they were awarded bath towels and wash basins.  Watch FlorCruz describe China's transformation since his arrival in 1971 » . Today, my Hunan workmates have retired or changed jobs. The farm has disbanded, hit by the squeeze in state subsidies and by local and global competition. It has sold off its land to the local government and to real estate developers.  Watch as China marks 30 years of reform » . Thirty years ago, there was little international trade. There were few tourists and few cars, but there were millions of bicycles on the streets. Now the streets are jammed with cars, and the air is polluted with fumes, grit and noise. Beijing's neighborhoods used to be very quiet. Residents lived simple lives mostly in walled courtyards. A seven- or eight-story building was considered unusually high. Now they are dwarfed by skyscrapers which house fancy shopping malls and outlets like McDonald's, KFC and Starbucks. Fashion used to be just as simple, and utilitarian Regulation attire was the so-called Mao jackets in blue, green and gray and baggy pants of the same colors. The unisex look was the norm. Now street fashion is varied and colorful, if not always chic. Virtually everyone had a job 30 years ago, but they earned little money, and there was little to buy. Supplies of basic commodities were so tight that residents were doled out ration coupons, required to go with cash to buy cotton jackets and clothes, grain, and cooking oil. No coupons, no transaction. Consumers in the late seventies coveted the so-called ""four big things"" -- a radio, a bicycle, a sewing machine and a wristwatch. And they were available only in special shops, like the Friendship Store. Now the new ""big things"" would include a Mercedes Benz, an apartment and a week-long vacation in Bali or Hawaii. All this would have been inconceivable 30 years ago. But Deng Xiaoping did conceive. Fondly remembered as the ""chief architect"" of China's reform and open-door program, he envisioned a modern, prosperous China and pointed the way forward. Deng's reforms set off a series of seismic changes, starting in the countryside with the disbanding of the people's communes. He admonished farmers to work hard and get rich. The farmers responded enthusiastically. Later, Deng shifted the reform to the cities by experimenting with capitalism in designated Special Economic Zones and then spreading it nationwide. Deng's reform was hailed as a Second revolution. When I worked as a reporter for Time Magazine (1982-2000) the magazine honored him as Time's Man of the Year -- not just once but twice. There was opposition along the way. There was backlash from the Left and from the Right, as China oscillated from free-wheeling capitalism to puritanical communism. That's why there were political campaigns in and outside the party, like the one against ""bourgeois liberalization"" in the 1980s. And that was largely why the Tiananmen protests happened in 1989. China has come a long way, but in my interviews with Deng's political successors, they made it clear that China will have to proceed cautiously and change step by step. ""Cross the river while feeling the pebbles under the water,"" was the aphorism proposed by the former premier Zhao Ziyang. Why the caution? When I interviewed then President Jiang Zemin in 1999, he explained why. ""There is no encyclopedia that China could simply copy and follow,"" he said. China's reforms have brought about remarkable achievements, but they also triggered unintended consequences: rising unemployment, growing income gaps, environmental degradation, corruption, rising criminality and social unrest. China has done the easy part. Now comes the hard part. China is facing the ripple effects of the global economic downturn: Chinese exports are declining, factories are closing down, workers are laid off en masse. China's leaders are facing one of the worst economic crises in 30 years. It will take 30 years and more for China to find the right development model so it could change steadily without losing its national identity, ruining its environment and disrupting social and political harmony. Only then can they fully realize Deng Xiaoping's goal of a modern and prosperous China.","China has undergone a radical makeover in the 30 years since Deng's reforms .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Lee Byung-hun's arrival in the packed auditorium at a London screening of his latest film, ""The Good, The Bad, The Weird,"" causes a well-behaved sizzle of excitement to run through the largely female and Asian audience. Lee Byung-hun takes a walk on the dark side in ""The Good, . The Bad, The Weird."" His name is whispered breathlessly between friends, but in a classic display of Asian politeness, the only indication there is a genuine heartthrob in the room are a couple of poorly contained shrieks. Tall, exquisitely chiseled and with the kind of smooth line-free skin that belies his 38 years, it's not hard to see why Lee is also known as the ""James Dean of Asia."" In his native South Korea he is best known for brooding, soulful performances in romantic films and TV dramas. He's a hot star now, especially after his eye-catching performance in ""The Good, The Bad, The Weird,"" says Jean Noh, deputy Asia editor based in Korea for global film trade magazine Screen International. ""He has huge popularity, it seems, in Japan and amongst their diaspora as well, thanks to his TV and film roles,"" she says. And, now, he is starting to make a name for himself outside Asia. Lee is set to grace UK screens in January when Kim Jee-woon's so-called Kimchi western, ""The Good, the Bad, the Weird,"" is released. Next year will see him co-star with Josh Hartnett in the crime thriller ""I Come with the Rain,"" directed by Vietnamese Tran Anh Hung who made his name on the global movie scene in 1993 with ""The Scent of Green Papaya."" Lee has also wrapped up filming on the highly anticipated Hollywood action flick, ""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra."" Lee is in London to promote ""The Good, the Bad, the Weird,"" and is polite and unassuming in person, taking time to reflect as he delivers his responses in English. ""People told me, 'Your eyes changed. You look so bad,'"" Lee says of playing the film's titular ""Bad,"" a sadistic killer who heads up a gang of bandits. ""I was so happy about that."" From his black leather-clad hands to his wild, psychotic eyes, an air of cool, remorseless detachment envelops him. In a review, Variety described Lee's eyes as ""commanding"" and having a ""Korean psycho-gangster mentality."" It is an unsettling performance, and one of the film's many highlights. After playing primarily romantic leads, Lee says playing a villain was a refreshing experience for him and something he'd been thinking about for his entire acting career. ""Actors always want to play the villain role at least once in their life. I had a good time because I could finally realize a full range of expressions and emotions,"" he told CNN. Set in the 1930s, the film follows three Korean outlaws on a chase across the desert plains of Japan-occupied Manchuria on a hunt for a legendary treasure map. The movie hits on a trifecta: It stars three of South Korea's leading actors (Lee is joined on screen by Song Kang-ho and Jung Woo-sung), has a massive $17 million budget and is helmed by the award-winning Kim. With stunning wide shots of endless horizons filmed in China's Gobi Desert and edge-of-your-seat action from start to finish, Kim's homage to Sergio Leone's 1966 classic ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" with more than a hint of ""Indiana Jones"" delivers a steady stream of adrenaline. Have you seen ""The Good, The Bad, The Weird?"" What did you think? Lee says his character was perfected through several conversations, discussions and arguments with Kim, a close friend who also directed him in 2005's ""A Bittersweet Life."" Everybody has bad characters in their mind, even if it may be small or in their subconscious, Lee explains, referring to his preparation for the role. ""Of course, I have that kind of character inside of me, I think. So, I amplified my bad side. But the main thing is the mind, I think, which comes from the inside,"" he told CNN. Lee has always had star power, says Noh from Screen International. ""But he had to grow into his acting chops. He worked prolifically in TV and film, and seems serious about his career choices,"" she says. This role is the screen idol's latest step in a slow break out from ""type,"" since his turn as an enforcer for an underworld boss in the film noir ""A Bittersweet Life."" In South Korea, where celebrities are closely scrutinized by the public and Internet gossip is rampant, Lee, who is a target because of his film star status, says he tries his best to steer clear of online chatter. The spread of rumors over the Web is one of the biggest problems that exists in South Korea. The recent suicide of one of the nation's leading actresses was blamed on online gossip. ""There has to be change,"" Lee said. ""I try not to read those kinds of things. I think it's better to do that."" This may have been easier for him recently, as he has been busy working on projects outside of South Korea, although, he says these too hold their challenges. Working in Hollywood was difficult, especially acting in English which, says Lee, made it harder for him to focus on his emotions and expressions. Lee plays Storm Shadow in the action movie ""G.I. Joe,"" which is due for release next summer. The movie, based on the popular comic and cartoon series, boasts a star-studded cast, including Sienna Miller and Dennis Quaid. ""Everything was so different. It was really hard,"" he said about filming ""G.I. Joe."" ""But it was a very good experience for me."" He's now back in Korea working but isn't ruling out the possibility of returning to Hollywood. He says he could envision going back and forth between South Korea and the U.S. ""Of course, if they have good projects for me, then I would participate.""","South Korean actor Lee Byung-hun is starting to connect with global audiences .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China's president has vowed to continue the economic reforms that have transformed the once poverty-riddled nation into an industrial powerhouse. Deng Xiaoping envisioned a modern, prosperous China. Speaking on the 30th anniversary of China's decision to open itself up to the outside world, President Hu Jintao told a crowd of 6,000 at Beijing's Great Hall of the People: ""Standing still and regressing will lead only to a dead end."" Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was the architect of the economic reform movement, which was to set the country on a radical new course when the first policies were approved on December 18, 1978.

"(CNN) -- Reserve Virginia police captain Kevin Quick's body hasn't been confirmed found, yet that didn't deter authorities from announcing Friday that they have charged five people in connection with his disappearance and his death. Scores of police opened a press conference Friday -- exactly one week after Quick's family last reported seeing him -- by turning to face a flag as it was lowered to half-staff in Quick's memory. Addressing Quick's family, Michael Wilhelm -- the police chief in the small central Virginia city of Waynesboro where the 45-year-old Quick was a volunteer officer and also lived -- said, ""Words cannot begin to express the sorrow we feel just knowing that you are bearing such a profound loss."" Authorities have not said how, when or why Quick died. Nor have they specified his relation to those involved in his disappearance and death, including whether he knew them personally, was targeted for his police work or perhaps was randomly targeted. Speaking in a general sense to law enforcement colleagues, Wilhelm said, ""I ask that you continue to honor's Kevin memory and let his tragic loss serve as a reminder that the work that we have dedicated our lives to is not finished."" Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corrine Geller then spoke about a man's body found on Thursday near the Goochland-Fluvanna county line, between Richmond and Charlottesville, before adding that it hadn't yet been positively identified as Quick or as anyone else. ""However, due to the time that has transpired since Kevin's disappearance, the fact that his vehicle was abandoned, and his whereabouts have not been established yet, we have transitioned from a disappearance investigation to a death investigation,"" Geller said. The police spokeswoman detailed a number of significant developments in the case, including the arrests of three individuals -- 22-year-old Gert Wright, 49-year-old Leslie Hope Casterlow and 31-year-old Anthony Stokes, Jr. -- ""without incident"" on Thursday night outside of a Prince William County hotel. All three are being held without bond at Henricho County Jail on felony charges of being ""a principal in the second degree"" to Quick's death and of gang participation. This is in addition to previously announced arrests of three siblings Tuesday night at a hotel in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia. Daniel Mathis and his sister, Mersadies Shelton, have been charged with grand larceny in the theft of Quick's 1999 Toyota 4Runner. A second sister, Shantai Shelton -- who has not yet charged directly in Quick's case -- was picked up on an outstanding warrant from Louisa County, east of Charlottesville, where Sunday night's armed robbery took place, Geller said earlier this week. The 18-year-old Mathis also was charged with robbery, malicious wounding and a variety of weapons-related charges in connection with the Sunday-night robbery, but no details of that holdup were released. Geller, from the state police, said investigators ""are still piecing together ... this network of individuals and determining exactly what role, what acquaintance, what association they may have had with one another."" She emphasized that no one yet has been deemed directly responsible for Quick's death. Still, murder charges could be forthcoming -- perhaps against someone who hasn't been arrested yet. ""There are additional charges pending in this,"" Geller said. ""There may possibly still be additional arrests."" Arrests made in truck theft, but police captain still missing . Last seen by family one week ago . In 1990, Quick joined his father in the reserve arm of the Waynesboro, Virginia, police department -- members of which aren't paid but hold ranks, have badges and carry firearms like full-timers. He rose up the ranks while working paying day jobs, including the past 15 years as a production coordinator for the synthetic fabrics company Invista. His position there was eliminated in what Waynesboro police Sgt. Brian Edwards called an ""amicable"" separation. The morning of Friday, January 31, he'd taken his mother -- with whom he was living in Afton -- out to breakfast at a local Cracker Barrel. That meal was the last time Quick's credit card was used, according to Edwards. He'd also spent that day prepping for his brother's surprise birthday celebration, including getting the venue and music in order. Quick had been legally separated from his wife since 2007, but their divorce was not final, Edwards said. He said another woman gave birth to Quick's daughter four months ago, and he was headed to their home in neighboring Albemarle County at the time he disappeared. According to an affidavit, Quick texted his child's mother, saying he was on the way. His phone has been turned off since last Friday night. In fact, he was last seen about 10:15 p.m. that night leaving the Afton, Virginia, home that he shared with his mother. Authorities said his family believed the officer was off duty at the time and heading to a friend's house in neighboring Albemarle County about 20 miles away. But he never made it there. Never showed up for family birthday party . His family reported him missing the following day, after Quick failed to show up for the birthday party for his brother that he'd planned. His 4Runner was captured by surveillance cameras at automatic teller machines twice. The first time was in the town of Fork Union, about 50 miles from Afton, about 11:40 Friday night; the second was in Manassas, on the outskirts of Washington, on Saturday night, Geller said. Each time, the same two people were in the picture, she said -- but authorities haven't said which, if any, of those arrested were in the image. The SUV turned up parked under a carport on rural property in Mineral, more than 30 miles northeast of Fork Union, on Monday. Three days later, state police and a Fluvanna County investigator went down Old Columbia Road after getting ""some intelligence that these individuals may have been out there, the vehicle may have been out in that area."" They stopped and found a man's body shortly before noon in a wooded area on private property. That body was transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond to undergo an autopsy and be positively identified. Such an identification isn't the only missing piece of the puzzle. Authorities also still haven't found a weapon that may have been used to kill Quick, nor have they publicly outlined a motive. But on Friday, they did begin the grieving process. Wilhelm, the Waynesboro police chief, urged people to look out for Quick's family, friends and former colleagues. ""No one can make it through this alone,"" he said. ""We must continue to support Kevin's family, his friends, and our brothers and sisters from our law enforcement family.""

"(CNN) -- Christian militia fighters killed at least 72 Muslim men and boys in two attacks in a remote southwestern corner of the strife-torn Central African Republic, rights group Human Rights Watch said Thursday. The attacks in the village of Guen, which occurred in February, came to light after the rights group interviewed survivors, mostly women, children and the elderly, who had sought refuge in a nearby village. Researchers also uncovered another massacre two weeks later in another village, Yakongo, this time of 19 people. They were killed by armed fighters from Seleka, a predominantly Muslim group, supported by cattle herders, the rights group said in a report. According to Human Rights Watch, French and African Union peacekeeping forces are deployed in the larger southwestern towns of Boda and Carnot but do not patrol the road between them where these villages lie. The spiraling ethnic violence in the Central African Republic has led some observers to fear another genocide like that seen in Rwanda nearly 20 years ago. The Central African Republic was plunged into chaos last year after Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March 2013, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. One of Seleka's leaders, Michel Djotodia, then seized power, only to step down as president in January after failing to halt the escalating violence. Catherine Samba-Panza, the mayor of Bangui, was recently installed as the country's interim President, but the situation remains volatile. To counter attacks on Christian communities by Seleka groups, vigilante Christian groups known as the anti-balaka, which translates to ""anti-machete,"" have fought back. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that anti-balaka fighters were behind the two attacks on Muslims in Guen, one on February 1 and the second four days later. One woman described seeing her husband being set upon with machetes as she fled with their 4-year-old son. And the father of 10-year-old Oumarou Bouba told Human Rights Watch that the militia did not spare his son despite his young age. ""I took my son when the anti-balaka attacked,"" he said. ""As we were running away, he was shot by the anti-balaka. He was shot in the right leg, and he fell down, but they finished him off with a machete. I had no choice but to run on. I had been shot too. I later went to see his body, and he had been struck in his head and in the neck."" Human Rights Watch called for Samba-Panza's interim government to investigate the killings and hold those responsible to account. It also called for the international community to hasten the authorization and deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force in order to protect vulnerable people in remote areas. ""These horrendous killings show that the French and AU peacekeeping deployment is not protecting villages from these deadly attacks,"" said Lewis Mudge, Africa researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""The Security Council shouldn't waste another minute in authorizing a United Nations peacekeeping mission with the troops and capacity to protect the country's vulnerable people."" On Tuesday, the European Union announced a military operation to help restore stability to the Central African Republic. It will focus on securing the country's capital, Bangui, and its airport, ""with a view to handing over to a U.N. peacekeeping operation or to African partners,"" a statement said. France, the former colonial power in the Central African Republic, deployed 1,600 personnel there to support African Union troops in December after a U.N. Security Council vote authorizing military intervention. Last year's coup was the latest in a series since the country gained independence in 1960. CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","Survivors tell of a massacre of Muslim men and boys in a remote village, rights group says .

"(CNN) -- Rainforest covers 60 percent of Indonesia, yet this developing country is among the world's highest carbon emitters. The reason: it has one of the world's fastest rates of deforestation, mainly for palm oil production. As trees are felled, the carbon stored in them and the soil is released into the atmosphere. The United Nations Environment Program estimated that between 2003 and 2006, deforestation and forest degradation reached 1.17 million hectares per year. Louis Verchot, a leading climate scientist, in Indonesia to measure carbon emissions through deforestation, illustrated the problem. ""Around us here we have a very young oil palm plantation and around the oil palms you can see the stumps of the trees, this area was probably logged between three and five years ago,"" he said. ""We're trying to understand how this change from forest through degradation to oil palm affects the emission of greenhouse gases."" But there is a solution, in the form of the United Nations program Reducing Emissions from Deforestation (REDD, which has Indonesia as one of its pilot countries. Through REDD, Norway has pledged to give Indonesia up to one billion dollars if it can prove a reduction in its emissions and halt deforestation. As part of its new commitments, in January 2011 Indonesia begins a two-year ban on any new clearing of forests. Agus Purnomo, National Council on Climate Change, Indonesia, said: ""If you are living in area where there are no other economic activities you are bound to cut the trees. ""But if there are other economic activities which will be created by this financial assistance then the local communities, the local companies and the local governments will be able to continue their economic development activities without damaging the forests."" However, there is one group that has yet to be convinced, and that is Indonesia's indigenous population. Untung Abdullah, a spokesman for the Orang Rimba people, whose forest homeland has all but disappeared and who are now living in a state-controlled park, said: ""The forest is very important for the Orang Rimba. We're born in the forest. The huge woods are our home. ""We want the government to provide us with a reserve area so we can manage the land by ourselves and not break government regulations."" Mina Setra, of AMAN, the Indigenous People's Alliance, added: ""Indigenous peoples in Indonesia have experienced massive encroachment of their land and territories. ""When their territories change into something else that they don't understand like oil palm plantations it really has a big impact on their livelihoods. ""For us forests belong to us because they are in our territories. We existed before Indonesia exists, before our country exists."" Purnomo knows he must win over these objections if the ban on deforestation is to be a success. He said: ""What I say to them is let's give this initiative the benefit of the doubt. If they just want to sit back and protest we will only be able to deliver partial success. ""We can build both economic benefits to local people today, while preserving the livelihood with the same high quality of life for future generations. We could really make this breakthrough a reality."" Verchot, too, is optimistic the policy can be a success. He is trying to measure the emissions caused by a change from forest to palm oil plantations to give solid data on Indonesia's carbon emissions. ""I think we're at a turning point,"" said Verchot. ""A lot has changed but we're not quite there yet. ""Scientifically, technically we can do this -- there's not a problem that resources and a little bit of time can't solve. But there are problems I think that require still more changes in political will to push us over the finish line."" Purnomo added: ""It should be a no-brainer for decision-makers of the world to choose working on reducing emissions in Indonesia, because it delivers three things instead of one: it reduces emissions; it alleviates poverty and it conserves biological diversity. ""Why is it so difficult? Let's make it happen."" Catriona Davies contributed to this report .","Deforestation reached 1.17 million hectares per year, between 2003 and 2006 .

"(CNN) -- There has been a lot of chatter in the media lately about Hillary Clinton's record as secretary of state. And aside from what Karl Rove says, the right wing's talking point du jour has been that she didn't have one ""signature"" accomplishment. But that couldn't be further from the truth. While she achieved a great deal as our nation's top diplomat, one accomplishment stands out: She restored America's standing in the world. Believe me, this was no small feat. Think back to 2009 when Secretary Clinton took office: The United States was engaged in two lengthy, expensive, deadly wars; the previous administration's unilateral foreign policy had alienated our strongest allies; our respect around the world was extremely low; and Osama bin Laden -- the most wanted man in the world -- was still on the run. We weren't just in a rut; we were in what seemed like a bottomless pit. And we were in desperate need of a strong leader to dig us out. Rove criticized for Clinton 'brain injury' suggestion . That leader was Secretary Clinton. On Day One, Clinton began the long, arduous task of shedding the black cloud that had hovered over U.S. foreign policy for nearly a decade. She embarked on a world tour with the goal of repairing diplomatic ties with leaders, restoring America's stature on the global stage, and reinvigorating longstanding friendships. Hillary Clinton knew that there was ""a lot of damage to repair:"" ""There's a great exhalation of breath going on around the world as people express their appreciation for the new direction that's being set,"" she said. As Michael Hirsh explained in Foreign Affairs, ""Because of her worldwide popularity and tireless travel -- she set a new record for a secretary of state by visiting 112 countries -- Clinton helped undo the damage that the habitual unilateralism of the George W. Bush administration had done to the global image of the United States."" Secretary Clinton was perfectly clear that this was a top priority: ""[I] inherited such a range of problems and deficits across the world that it would be a luxury to say, 'I'm going to focus on this and this alone.'...My big-picture commitment is to restore American leadership, and I think that's about as big a job as you can get. And everything I've done is in furtherance of that."" And there is no doubt that she was successful. A Pew Research poll found that the opinion of countries all over the world toward the United States has improved dramatically since the tenure of Clinton's predecessor. But restoring America's standing in the world not only required repairing relationships with global leaders, it required tackling two colossal tasks left behind from the previous administration -- winding down two wars and bringing Osama bin Laden to justice. Secretary Clinton took office eight years after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on America, yet Osama bin Laden -- the mastermind of those attacks and leader of the world's most infamous terrorist organization -- had still not been found. Clinton supported the raid that finally brought our nation's greatest enemy to justice. Secretary Clinton's work to restore America's standing in the world paved the way for many of her other major accomplishments and helped bring forward a new era in American diplomacy. Clinton: No need for new Benghazi committee, but GOP 'calls the shots' in the House . The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the most deeply rooted, complex issues of global politics. Dealing with this conflict has been high on the agenda of nearly every secretary of state for decades. In November 2012, Clinton helped avert an all-out war in Gaza by negotiating a cease-fire between Israel and Palestine. After eight days of violence, as Politico noted, ""Secretary of State Hillary Clinton got a Gaza cease-fire right at the moment hope seemed dead for a rapid end to the violence."" In today's complex world, where we are not always dealing with predictable actors, one of the single most important thing we can do to protect our great nation -- and our allies -- is to ensure that there are fewer nuclear weapons. As secretary of state, Clinton made great strides in countering the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world. She played a pivotal role in the passage and enactment of the New START Treaty, which will reduce key nuclear arsenals to their lowest levels in 50 years. Concerned with Iran's expanding nuclear program, Secretary Clinton focused her efforts on building a multinational coalition to impose unprecedented sanctions designed to press Iran to comply with its international obligations. Through aggressive diplomacy she persuaded countries around the world, including the EU, Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Australia to impose sanctions of their own, multiplying the power of our sanctions and the pressure on Iran. These sanctions decreased Iran's oil exports by more than a million barrels a day -- costing Iran nearly $3 billion a month. These are all impressive feats, but Hillary Clinton's accomplishments don't end there.
