"(CNN) -- Well, so much for the idea that Americans don't care about soccer. The U.S. National team made it out of the so-called ""group of death"" Thursday to advance to the knockout round of competition at the FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Regardless of how much further the Stars and Stripes advance in the biggest sporting event on the planet, they already have revealed something that even casual observers can see. Soccer is now woven inextricably into the fabric of American life. Television viewership numbers continue to set new highs with each U.S. game The proverbial office water cooler has been abuzz with chatter about the U.S. team's dramatic 2-1 win over Ghana and its heartbreaking, last second 2-2 tie with Portugal. ""Where are you watching the game"" has become the question of the day. Thousands filled the streets for viewing parties in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Seattle and Washington -- in the middle of the workday. Soccer used to be their game -- the Europeans, the South Americans, the Africans. Today it is our game too, bringing the nation together in a passionate embrace of its athleticism, its skill and, yes, its excitement. But it hasn't always been this way. Even after the U.S. hosted the World Cup for the first time in 1994 -- setting attendance records that still stand today -- many still dismissed soccer as somehow not quite American. Some, like political commentator Ann Coulter, still do. She wrote Thursday in the Clarion Ledger: ""I promise you: No American whose great-grandfather was born here is watching soccer,"" she said in an op-ed. ""One can only hope that, in addition to learning English, these new Americans will drop their soccer fetish with time."" A few million Americans disagree. Slowly, but surely though, soccer has grown on us as a nation. Why? A changing America has become younger and more diverse, and those two demographics simply love soccer more than their parents. Increased immigration from regions where you learn how to kick a soccer ball as soon as you learn how to walk -- Latin America, Africa, Europe -- and particularly, our growing Hispanic population, is only deepening the nation's relationship with soccer. In the U.S., the Latino population has soared to 17%, according to the U.S. Census. And that number is only growing. And by most estimates, the U.S. will be more non-white than white somewhere around 2043, with most of that growth coming from countries where soccer is the dominant sport. And members of the Millennial generation -- those born between 1980 and the early 2000s -- have been big drivers of the growth in soccer in the U.S. Between 1990 and today, the number of players registered in organized youth soccer programs doubled to 4 million, according to the U.S. Soccer Federation, the governing body for the game in the United States. While most Baby Boomers cut their sporting teeth on football, basketball and baseball, today's young adults are arguably the first generation to grow up with soccer as a major sport in their lives from their earliest childhood memories. It's a widely shared experience among today's young adults. Today, soccer is the second favorite sport for those 12 to 24 years old. It's the third largest participation sport in the country. Soccer is the team sport with the highest growth rate over the past decade. That 41% of players are women only broadens its appeal. U.S teams performing increasingly well on the international stage hasn't hurt either. The U.S. Men's National team has qualified for seven consecutive World Cups. Our Women's National team is ranked No. 1 in the world. While interest naturally peaks among aficionados and novices alike during a mega event like the World Cup, and subsides afterward, this is not a passing fad. Total attendance at soccer matches in the U.S. in 2013 exceeded 10 million, according to attendance figures compiled by U.S. Soccer. Our country has become the largest market in the world for international matches, according to the U.S. Soccer Federation, the governing body for the game in the United States. At the professional level, Major League Soccer has expanded to 22 markets and there is more soccer on television in the U.S. than any other country in the world. Some 2,928 matches from around the world were shown live in 2012. TV ratings for the World Cup have already topped the NBA Finals and the World Series in America -- Sunday's game against Portugal brought in more than 25 million viewers and was the most-watch soccer match in U.S. history. It is a niche no more. But we need to make it even more accessible. For example, the standard pay-to-play model -- where participation in local leagues can cost parents as much as $1,800 per child, not including travel -- has been a barrier to access for children and families in low-income communities. The U.S. Soccer Foundation is working to provide thousands of children and families in under-resourced communities with easy and affordable access to quality soccer programming and safe places to play. Not too many years ago, the standard joke was that soccer was the game of the future -- and always would be. Well, it seems the future is finally here and it's here to stay.

"Thousands of now-state-run restaurants in Cuba will move into the private sector and be run by citizen owners, the island nation's government announced Friday. The Cuban Domestic Trade department put the number eateries being privatized at 9,0000 -- compared with 1,261 private family-run restaurants already operating. The state will still own the land the restaurants sit on. This is not the Cuban government's first step towards a more private economy for Cuba. Self-employment including the creation of privately owned ""paladares"" was first authorized in 1993. Moreover, in May 2011, President Raul Castro's government announced a new reform plan that shifted toward the free market and announced that some state-owned businesses such as barbershops or beauty shops would become private. ""In order to lift the economy, the Cuban government took the decision to get out of businesses they have been running badly for the last 50 years,"" Philip Peters, president of the Cuban Research Center, a Washington-based analysis organization told CNN Friday . The privately owned restaurants already in business in Cuba ""offer interesting new dishes and they are doing very well,"" according to Tomas Bilbao, executive director of the Cuba Study Group. ""Cuban entrepreneurs can now buy these (newly privatized) places from the government and negotiate the price,"" he told CNN. ""They will also have to pay taxes and social security. ""The benefit of buying one of these state owned restaurant is the location, the reputation and the utensils available that may be hard to find in Cuba,"" Bilbao said. The Cuban government had previously said that it would get out of the restaurant business, and Friday's announcement is ""part of the updating of the economic social model,"" said Deputy Minister of Domestic Trade Ada Chavez. Cuba's Domestic Trade department said that the government was seeking to expand ""services with quality and safety that the Cuban people and tourists visiting the island deserve."" According to the Cuban National Statistics office, Cuba hosted around 2.8 million tourists in 2012, and private restaurants are very important to the development of the tourism industry. ""For many people who visit Cuba, these restaurants are part of the attraction,"" said Peters. ""It is a socialist economy, it's going to stay a socialist economy but with a much bigger private sector in it.""","The restaurants had been government-owned, as are many businesses in Cuba .

"Lights, camera, fashion. The New York Fashion Week action is afoot, with designers showcasing their spring 2015 collections this week and next, before heading overseas to London, Milan and Paris. See all of CNN Living's New York Fashion Week coverage . What will be sent down the runways, and ultimately into consumers' closets? Two fashion forecasters from WGSN, the official trend sponsor for the sleek affair, weigh in with their predictions. A strut down memory lane . As the fashion world looks to spring, designers will be looking back -- particularly to the 1970s -- for inspiration, according to WGSN's head of catwalk, Lizzy Bowring. If the prospect of a ""Saturday Night Fever"" renaissance seems less than groovy, Bowring assures the retro influence will be subdued. Caftan comfy, caftan chic . ""The idea is to get back into yesteryear but add a contemporary twist with a fresh modern appeal,"" Bowring says. Pants will take up a slight flare, and just as Diane Keaton notably catapulted menswear into the spotlight in 1977's ""Annie Hall,"" so will the fashion-forward in spring 2015. Bowring says one of the big themes will be a ""fuss-free approach of androgyny"": Think sleek, sophisticated jumpsuits and/or tailored jackets paired with relaxed wide-leg trousers. In a similar vein, Jaclyn Jones, WGSN's senior womenswear editor, forecasts that the basic white dress shirt, a wardrobe staple, will be transformed with more dramatic side vents and cuffs, origami folding, embellishments and the like. Jones also expects a sampling of tent dresses, sometimes referred to as trapeze dresses, to hit the catwalks. (If the garment were laid flat on a surface, its silhouette would gradually flare out from the shoulders and resemble the shape of a tent -- hence the name.) Both forecasters anticipate a continuation of longer hemlines with midi skirts (skirts that fall midcalf), as well as ankle-length wrap versions, with their waistlines falling at the natural waist versus the hip. While hemlines are lower, Bowring says there certainly will be no shortage of shorts, particularly of the Bermuda variety. Straddling that line is one of the most talked-about trends for spring: culottes, a wide-leg, airy, not-quite-shorts, not-quite-pants silhouette. Keeping it cool . Spring and pastels go together like April showers and May flowers. For 2015, those pastel tones will be washed out and desaturated. In keeping with that, there will also be a ""core neutral story,"" Jones says, with shades of tan, taupe, gray, white and black. Bowring expects collections will also be brimming with different shades of purple, particularly lilac. As for patterns, both predict there will be a bouquet of hand-painted florals, including of the Hawaiian theme. ""It's not going to scream 'Hawaiian,' it's going to be more sophisticated and you're going to realize it's a hibiscus flower after,"" Jones says.","Fashion forecasters predict spring collections will channel the 1970s .

"Dorchester, Massachusetts (CNN) -- President Barack Obama insisted Tuesday that education spending needs to be spared from the growing drive for fiscal austerity, telling an audience of students and teachers in Massachusetts that cutbacks would ultimately prove self-defeating. ""We need to come up with a budget that forces government to live within its means,"" Obama said. But we ""cannot cut back on job-creating investments like education."" The president stressed the need for blending public education reform -- including greater accountability -- and higher spending. ""We have a moral and economic imperative to give every child a chance to succeed,"" he declared. ""A budget that sacrifices our commitment to education is a budget that sacrifices our country's future."" Obama delivered his remarks at TechBoston Academy in Dorchester, a largely minority urban Boston neighborhood with traditionally higher unemployment and other economic woes. The academy, which opened in 2002 as a partnership between the public schools, private business and philanthropists, boasts a graduation rate roughly 20 percentage points higher than schools in the Boston area as a whole. Ninety-four percent of students from TechBoston's most recent graduating class went on to college. The president praised the school -- which has a longer academic year and strict academic requirements -- as a model for the rest of the country. Obama's proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 includes an 11% hike in federal education spending, to more than $77 billion. A number of GOP congressional leaders are seeking to reduce federal spending on education, with many arguing it should be primarily a state and local concern. Among other things, the administration has made a pledge to prepare an additional 100,000 science, technology, math and engineering teachers by the end of the decade. The White House also is pushing to make permanent the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which is worth up to $10,000 for four years of college. Obama has also asked Congress for $900 million for a new round in the Race to the Top competition, which rewards states and localities that meet the administration's standards for educational innovation and outcomes. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","Obama warns that education cuts will undermine America's economic future .

"(CNN) -- An American graduate student who went to Iraq to find ways to help ordinary citizens persevere in a transitioning government was one of two American civilians killed in a Sadr City bombing. Nicole Suveges, a political scientist working toward her doctorate, died in a Sadr City bombing Tuesday. Nicole Suveges, a married political scientist from Illinois, was part of a program that embeds academics into military units to help personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan navigate the local environment, according to her employer, BAE Systems. Suveges, who started her tour with Human Terrain System in April, had been assigned to support the 3rd Brigade Combat Team for the 4th Infantry Division in ""political, cultural, and tribal engagements,"" a statement from the program said. She was one of four Americans to die in the Sadr City bombing Tuesday. Two U.S. soldiers and a State Department employee, Steven Farley, who worked with the provincial reconstruction team, also were killed in the blast. ""Nicole was a leading academic who studied for years on how to improve conditions for others,"" Doug Belair, president of BAE's Technology Solutions & Services, said in a written statement. ""She came to us to give freely of herself in an effort to make a better world."" Suveges was the second BAE employee to die in a combat zone this year. Michael V. Bhatia, 31, a social scientist from Medway, Massachusetts, died in a roadside bombing May 7 in Afghanistan, BAE said. Scott Fazekas, BAE's director of communications, said Suveges and Bhatia were among three dozen social scientists hired by the company and its subcontractors to support the program. The Johns Hopkins University graduate student was also working toward a doctorate in political science with an emphasis on international relations. The focus of her dissertation was on the transition from an authoritarian regime to democracy and how it affects ordinary citizens, the university said. ""Nicole was committed to using her learning and experience to make the world a better place, especially for people who have suffered through war and conflict,"" William R. Brody, president of the university, said in a message Wednesday to the campus community. ""She exemplifies all that we seek to do at Johns Hopkins: to use knowledge for the good of humanity."" Mark Blyth, Suveges' primary faculty adviser, said that when Suveges came to Johns Hopkins, she planned to write her Ph.D. dissertation on how ideas move across borders from society to society, exploring how radical Islamic ideas filtered through Western European mosques. After the outbreak of the Iraq war, Suveges decided to shift her focus to the experience of ordinary citizens under a transitional government, said Blyth, a topic that had interested Suveges since her experience in Bosnia with the SFOR/NATO Combined Joint Psychological Operations Task Force. ""She was a very bright, engaging, sweet person, very intellectually curious,"" Blyth said Wednesday. BAE said Suveges' experience, which included a tour in Iraq as a civilian contractor and a stint in Bosnia in the 1990s as an Army reservist, made her especially valuable in efforts to improve the lives of Iraqis. A Human Terrain System statement said Suveges and others were attending a meeting of the District Advisory Council on Tuesday to elect a new chairman. The officials were helping mediate disputes among the Sadr City leadership and ""facilitate the development of a more representative local government,"" the statement said. The attack was blamed on a Shiite insurgent cell. Suveges graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1992 and received a master's degree in political science from George Washington University in 1998. She had delivered papers to international relations organizations and served as a graduate teaching assistant, the company said. At Johns Hopkins, she was managing editor for the Review of International Political Economy, the university said. Maj. Mike Kenfield, spokesman for the Army's training and doctrine command, said that the program was credited for ""reductions in non-lethal operations"" and that there had been talk about expanding the purview of the team to outside Iraq and Afghanistan. CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report .","Nicole Suveges, 38, was part of team of academic embeds advising military in Iraq .

"Rising wages in China may be squeezing the profits of many manufacturers -- but they are also feeding a boom in the robotics industry. Wages in China's cities rose 12.4% last year, while in rural areas they were boosted by 21.9%, according to figures from China's National Bureau of Statistics. While that may be good for workers, manufacturers are softening the blow to their balance sheets by turning to robotics -- which are cheaper, faster and deliver high quality. China is the fastest growing market in robotics, and by 2014 it will top the global market, according to the International Federation of Robotics. One company seeking to tap this demand is German-based KUKA Robotics, which is setting up a regional hub in the country. ""With the increase in the wages we can see a big automation wave coming,"" said Till Reuter, chief executive of KUKA Robotics. ""China is the market that is still growing, and growing at a fast pace compared to Europe and the U.S., "" he said. ""China will be the biggest robotic market, so it is important to be here."" The auto industry, for example, is becoming increasingly reliant on robotics. China is the world's largest auto market and European car manufacturers are setting up facilities in the region, all of which will be reliant on robotics. BMW opened a new plant in Shenyang last month and Volkswagen plans to double its capacity to four million cars by 2018, by investing in three new plants in Yizheng, Foshan and Ningbo and upgrading existing ones in Changchun, Nanjing and Chengdu. China's robotics industry still lags that in other countries. In Japan, for example, there are 306 robots working per 10,000 people while in China there are currently only 15. KUKA plans to capture the potential by producing more efficient models that will continue to drive down costs for manufacturers. ""Our advantage is innovation,"" said Reuter, ""we need to keep it alive and work towards the next generation. It gives us an advantage in China, but also in the rest of the world."" As China's robotics industry catches up with others, the country's manufacturers are also looking at other ways to bring in income. Investment in branding and marketing is one way to boost profits, according to Alistair Thornton, a senior analyst at IHS Global Insight. ""Manufacturers will think --- hold on, if we put money into branding and charge more for products, we can retain our margin,"" said Thornton.","China's rising wages are squeezing the profits of many manufacturers .

"Beijingers are once again choking as smog levels hit ""heavy or even worse"" levels in the capital and a number of other cities across the country. Persistent problems with city air have prompted officials and entrepreneurs to consider ways to protect their citizenry from the pollution. Beijing was under an ""orange"" smog alert Monday, which marks the first time the second-highest warning level of a new system introduced last year has been raised. The National Meteorological Center (NMC) Tuesday continued the alert for another 24 hours. Capital measures come amid fog of pollution . Heavy smog routinely blankets the capital, all but blotting out the sun and forcing residents inside. Australian Open champion Li Na revealed she's had to train indoors in Beijing due to the high levels of pollution, while smog across most of northern and eastern China has prompted officials to send teams of investigators to the worst-hit parts of the country. Officials at the Ministry of Environmental Protection cited ""unfavorable meteorological conditions and firework and firecracker spree(s)"" as the cause of the heavily polluted air. China's Lunar New Year celebrations, which took place earlier this month, are often accompanied by firework displays, and neighborhoods resound with the sound of firecrackers. The air pollution index recorded levels of over 400, referring to the number of PM2.5 -- harmful particulates measuring 2.5 microns or larger -- per cubic meter of air. The World Health Organization recommends guideline values of 25 PM2.5 in a 24-hour period. The smog is expected to ease towards the end of the week. Many are at least trying to tackle the matter themselves. From ubiquitous air filters in people's homes to the near-mandatory facemasks that Beijingers wear outdoors on heavily-polluted days, personal health is a priority. Given the restrictions in place on residents -- particularly the young and the elderly -- when the warnings go up, some more extreme measures have been taken. Life under the dome . The International School of Beijing has taken to shielding their young charges from the city's air as the next logical step. At a cost of $5 million, the school has constructed two domes that enclose the entirety of its outdoor areas, allowing students to play and exercise year-round, regardless of how smoggy life is outside the enclosure. While it is a costly solution, other schools, alongside sports facilities and even wealthy individuals are placing orders. Until the skies clear, life in the bubble seems surprisingly good. The world's factory . China's aggressive economic growth model means that heavy industrial activity also contributes heavily to the degradation of the air quality. As part of their anti-pollution measures, some factories surrounding the capital -- Hebei is a huge steel-producing region -- have been forced to close temporarily following the raising of the orange alert. Earlier in the year, the ministry upgraded emission standards for various heavy industries and waste disposal processes, upgrading protocols that were in some cases legacies of original standards, set in the 1980s before the onset of much of China's present industrial capacity. Problems, however, persist. The Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences and the Beijing-based Social Science Academic Press released a report in early February which ranked the two cities towards the top of a list of the worst-polluted cities. Beijing ranked second, just behind Moscow. Blue-sky thinking? In the face of growing social unease at worsening environmental conditions, authorities are committed to rectifying the problem, and Beijing will allocate 760 billion yuan (about 124.64 billion dollars) to improve the city's air quality by 2017, Mayor Wang Anshun said last month at a municipal NPC meeting. The figure includes incentives for clean factories, and the municipal government has also improved the case for electric vehicles (EVs) by granting subsidies and license plate lottery waivers to those buying Chinese-made cars, while switching government fleets to electric. The country is one of the world's largest producers of green energy technology, although much of it is exported at present. More ambitious fixes have been proposed, including more ""meteorological support services"" -- such as cloud seeding -- as well as a giant ""vacuum cleaner"" designed by a Dutch artist, and skyscraper-mounted sprinklers. These solutions, their inventors promise, will either trap or wash the smog away. Naked run . A novel approach to highlighting the problem came on Sunday as more than 300 runners, according to official news sources, took to Beijing Olympic Park wearing no more than their underwear -- and in at least one instance a gas mask -- to join a ""naked run"" protesting the city's poor air quality. The best defense is a good smog . A silver lining to the smog-cloud might be the military advantage it offers. Chinese military theorist Rear Admiral Zhang Zhaozhong told the Beijing Youth Daily that smog could be a defense against ""laser weapons"", given that heavy smog can impede or block the technology. ""Smog with PM2.5 readings of 500-600 is virtually impenetrable to lasers. In clear weather, laser weapons have a range of 10 kilometers, but smog can reduce this to less than 1 kilometer,"" he said, although later was forced to defend his remarks against accusations of naivety and advocating a reckless defense theory.","Beijing experiences Orange smog alert for the first time .

"""Looper,"" this past weekend's mind-bending futuristic thriller from writer/director Rian Johnson, follows ""The Terminator's"" time traveling mantra: There's no fate but what we make.  The destiny audiences forged helped ""Looper"" land at the box office in second place, earning the film a cool $21.2 million. Not bad for an R-rated action flick whose big questions would have made sci-fi novelist Philip K. Dick smirk. In the film, bottom barrel assassins are handpicked to do the future mobster's dirty work by killing targets in 2044, 30 years before time travel is even invented.  Unfortunately, the hit men collecting silver bounty off of bodies sent to the past tend to die young (sort of).  They retroactively commit suicide by murdering their future selves, giving them three decades to live life to the fullest. It's also full of space-time paradoxes. What if you could change the future by altering the past?  That's precisely what happens when Joe the looper, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, makes the mistake of letting his future form, played by Bruce Willis, escape. Time travel is obviously a sci-fi staple, but sometimes it's best to keep things simple. ""We'll be sitting here all day making diagrams with straws,"" Bruce Willis yells at his younger self after being hounded by questions about the history of things to come. But believe it or not, there are scientists who study the real world possibilities of time travel, and it's a lot of information to sip up. Combating bad pop culture time travel . Edward Farhi is a theoretical physicist from MIT who works with equations in a lab.  Naturally, he has a pretty good understanding of the special and general theories of relativity that illuminate the legitimate possibilities of time travel.  However, his studies also discredit the entire premise of being able to go back in time. ""The laws of physics were smart enough to not allow a causality violation,"" Farhi says. ""That means that you put the effect before the cause, which is what you do when you time travel backward.""  An example of this would be lighting a match near a gas canister and having it explode: You can't have an explosion without the lit match because that would be a causality violation. However, causality violations lead to some of ""Looper's"" most terrifying, gruesome and memorable moments.  One scene in particular features the bodily breakdown of a looper sent to the past.  Scars act as notes on a looper's body as they're being carved into the past version of his being.  Soon afterward, his limbs, tongue and nose disappear.  As his 2044 self is being tortured, we witness a paradox made of nightmares. Farhi was able to further prove his point by showing that if someone wanted to construct a device that would warp space enough to go back in time, they would need to assemble and collect half of the mass of the universe. In ""Looper,"" the time machine is just a shoddy mechanical sphere covered in coils. ""We wrote a paper called 'An Obstacle to Building a Time Machine' in the laboratory,"" Farhi says.  ""It would require a huge warping of space-time and have huge cosmological effects."" These effects are dramatic enough that they would have serious consequences for the entire universe. Theoretical physicist and Nobel Prize winner Gerard 'T Hooft further studied what could happen if one tried to travel back in time, Farhi explains. ""He showed that before you had enough time to go back to the past, the entire universe would collapse so that the universe would end in a big crunch, the opposite of the Big Bang,"" Farhi says. ""That really meant to me without really much further investigation that the laws of physics abhor time travel backward."" Farhi also doesn't favor the belief that one could jump into the past of a parallel universe.  ""I'm not usually a fan of describing the ultimate universe,"" he says. ""Maybe if you go back in time you end up in another universe and you somehow cannot affect what happens in the future."" 'Looper': A smart but confusing thriller . In theory, there would be different outcomes in different universes. ""I have trouble understanding that, but one of the things that bothers me about that is this: How come in our universe we never see time travelers?"" Albert Einstein introduced the idea in 1905 that the amount of time that elapses between two occurrences can depend upon the speed of the observer.  ""He was talking about the actual flow of time,"" Farhi says.  ""These texts only become really dramatic when you move close to the speed of light."" This means that while time travel to the past is virtually impossible, hopping into the future is an entirely different matter. If you managed to hop on a rocket and travel around Earth at the speed of light and one year has elapsed according to your clocks, you could return to find that it's actually a thousand years in the future.  ""You may wonder if that's science fiction or if it's real, but we believe it's real because every prediction that the special theory of relativity has ever made has been born out of experiment,"" Farhi says. ""These effects aren't dramatic if you're moving slowly, but they're still there."" A less dramatic effect of this is the use of GPS. The clocks in satellites that triangulate where you need to go move at a different rate because they're moving at a high speed. ""They're not moving fast, but they're moving at a speed relative to you on Earth,"" Farhi says. ""There's enough of an effect that if they didn't correct for the slowing of the clock that you would not be driving on the road."" If you couldn't travel at light speed on a rocket as a shortcut to the future, a hypothetical alternative would have you creating a strong gravitational force replicating a black hole. ""I could put you on a rope, and I could lower you into the very strong gravitational field of the black hole,"" Farhi explains. But there's a certain point that couldn't be passed. ""Once you get too close to a black hole, there's no force that can overcome the force of the gravitational force, and you're doomed."" The proposition is scary: ""You can just hover near the boundary where doom occurs,"" Farhi says. ""If you were hovering there, then your clocks would be running slower than mine."" Being closer to the black hole would allow one to age less and experience time differently. ""We could have a reality TV show,"" Farhi proposes.  ""A whole day would go by for me, and I would just see you reaching for your breakfast.""  Technically, the subjects of this time travel experiment could stay in touch through electromagnetic waves. ""Finally, we could come together and I could pull you out of the strong gravitational field,"" he says.  ""You could see that you hadn't aged very much and I've aged a lot, but you wouldn't be surprised because we've kept in touch the entire time."" Long story short: If you have the ability to travel at light speed or a strong gravitation field, taking a short path to the future is possible.  However, ""Looper"" presents a one-way trip to the past aside from montage sequences that show what's happening to Bruce Willis in the year 2070. That begs the question: If we're unable to go back to the past, how can the past exist? ""The past exists as memory,"" Farhi says.  We have books, we have movies, and we have memories.  ""The past exists in the present because it has an imprint on the present, but the future doesn't,"" he says. But we do have the ability to see the past.  ""You just need to look at the light from a distant galaxy,"" Farhi points out.  ""It depends on how far the galaxy is, but it could be a billion years ago. Astronomers are looking at ancient images all the time."" Despite whatever causality violations and problematic backward time traveling devices Rian Johnson presents, ""Looper"" is a strong sci-fi depiction of time travel. The audience holds the ultimate key to its plausibility: The suspension of disbelief. If you could time travel, where would you go and what would you do? Let us know in the comments below.","The sci-fi film ""Looper"" explores the concept of time travel .

"When even al Qaeda publicly rejects you because you are too brutal, it's likely a reasonable indicator that you are. A long simmering dispute between ""al Qaeda Central,"" headed by Ayman al-Zawahiri, and the most brutal al Qaeda affiliate in Syria, generally known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, surfaced publicly on Monday. On jihadist websites, al Qaeda's central leadership posted a notice saying ISIS ""is not a branch of the al Qaeda group."" It is the first time in its quarter century history that al Qaeda has officially rejected one of its affiliates. Why did this happen? ISIS and another al Qaeda affiliate known as the Nusra Front have been fighting each other in Syria for several weeks now. This open warfare caps a dispute between ISIS and Nusra about who is boss in Syria that has been brewing since ISIS released a statement in April announcing its official merger with Nusra. A leader of Nusra rejected the merger, and in June, al-Zawahiri annulled the merger. ISIS, in turn, rejected al-Zawahiri's annulment of the merger. (This is a fine example of what Freud usefully termed ""the narcissism of minor differences."") Al-Zawahiri is clearly fed up with ISIS's open rejection of his overall leadership of the al Qaeda network. Moreover, he is likely quite concerned about how ISIS is alienating ordinary Syrians by a brutal campaign that has involved the public beheading of opponents and the imposition of Taliban-style rule on the population, including the banning of smoking, music and unveiled women in public. Al Qaeda's leader has seen this movie before -- in western Iraq in 2006, when al Qaeda in Iraq (the parent organization of ISIS) imposed a brutal Taliban-like rule on the population that caused the Sunni tribes in western Iraq to rebel against al Qaeda in an uprising known as ""the Sunni Awakening."" The Sunni Awakening, with a heavy assist from the U.S. military, led to al Qaeda losing control of much of western Iraq by 2008. Nusra seems to have learned from the mistakes of al Qaeda in Iraq and is not imposing Taliban-style rule in the areas of Syria that it controls and is instead operating in a Hezbollah-like manner, providing social services. The group, for instance, provides bread and electricity in the eastern Syrian city of Ash Shaddadi, where it also controls the city's wheat silos and oil wells. Nursa also is engaging in the kind of alliance-building that al Qaeda affiliates generally have not been able to pull off because they regard compromise as a deviation from their God-given beliefs. Nusra has, for instance, allied with more moderate elements of the Syrian opposition to fight against ISIS during the past several weeks. Nusra, in fact, represents what al Qaeda's core leadership wants in one of its affiliates: A group that doesn't tarnish the al Qaeda brand by using brutal tactics against fellow Muslims. This has been a core concern for al Qaeda for the past decade. Al-Zawahiri sent a letter to al Qaeda in Iraq in the summer of 2005 admonishing the group against its campaign of killing Shia civilians. Similarly, Osama bin Laden wrote a private letter to the al Qaeda-aligned Somali terrorist group, Al-Shabaab, in 2010 telling the organization to stop attacking in the central market of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, because such attacks were killing Muslim civilians. Also in 2010, al Qaeda leaders wrote a private letter to the leader of the Pakistan Taliban telling him forcefully to suspend his group's campaign of attacks against mosques and markets, which was killing hundreds of Pakistani civilians. The difference now is that al Qaeda has gone public with its displeasure with ISIS and is also officially cutting the group off. Despite the bitter differences between the two al Qaeda-aligned groups in Syria, senior U.S. counterterrorism officials tell me they are ""All Syria. All the time."" That is because al Qaeda affiliated groups in Syria and neighboring Iraq now control more territory in the Arab world than at any time in their history; a swath of land that runs from northwestern Syria some 400 miles to the east into western Iraq. On Tuesday, CIA Director John Brennan testified before the House Intelligence Committee: ""There are camps inside of both Iraq and Syria that are used by al Qaeda to develop capabilities that are applicable, both in the theater, as well as beyond."" Brennan asserted that these camps represent a real threat to the United States. Adding to their concerns, U.S. counterterrorism officials tell me that more Americans have traveled to fight in Syria than was previously understood. They believe some 70 Americans have fought there over the past three years. Previous estimates suggested only a handful of Americans had done so. U.S. counterterrorism officials are rightly concerned that Americans who have fought in Syria will return to the States radicalized and perhaps even to plan to carry out terrorist attacks. That said, it isn't clear how many of the 70 Americans who are estimated to have fought in Syria have done so alongside the al Qaeda-aligned groups or with other more moderate rebel groups who are fighting the Bashar al-Assad regime with some degree of American support.","A Syrian rebel group has been disowned by al Qaeda .

"The fight is said to have lasted a half-hour and pitted a leopard against a woman armed only with a farm tool in an isolated field in India. Kalama Devi, at 54 years old, won. Devi, a widow and mother of one, has been telling her story from a hospital bed in Srinagar, in Uttarakhand state, where she's being treated for fractures, swelling, scratches and cuts to her skull that have required 50 stitches. ""I held the leopard with my hands, it then bit my hand and then left it. ... Both my hands are in immense pain and I am not able to lift them up,"" she said. According to the doctor who's treating her, the leopard pounced about 10 a.m. Sunday as Devi, who had been cutting grass with a sickle, walked through a field in the village of Koti Badma, in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand. It fractured her left hand first, so with her right hand clutching the sickle she repeatedly hit the animal -- for about 30 minutes. Exhausted and bleeding . She said she kept pounding the leopard until she ran out of energy, then, exhausted and bleeding, limped one kilometer to a nearby village to seek help, Dr. Abdul Rahul at the HNB Base Hospital in Srinagar told CNN. Villagers found the leopard dead when they went to the scene of the reported attack, the doctor said. It's not the first leopard attack in the area, Rahul said, though he added it was more common to see injuries as the result of attacks by bears. Another woman was recently killed by a young male cat, which was shot dead by hunters, according to Digvijay Khati, chief wildlife warden in Uttarakhand. ""These are alarming incidents because usually leopards attack and kill dogs, goats or young children -- not adults,"" Khati told CNN. He said the big cats' natural habitat is shrinking, and their natural prey are becoming scarce. However, Khatis said, ""We cannot say that the increase of human population in the areas is responsible, because attacks have even occurred where human population is less, and people are now moving out to the plains in search of work,"" he said.","Leopard attacked Kalama Devi on Sunday morning in isolated field .

"The Michigan High School Athletic Association on Thursday approved a waiver provision that gives a student athlete with Down syndrome a chance to continue participating in sports despite being 19 years old. Under the new provision, Eric Dompierre, who will be a senior in the fall, could be approved to play as early as August if the Ishpeming School District formally seeks a waiver for him, said John Johnson, spokesman for the athletic association. ""I just want to say thank you for everybody to support me through all of this,"" the rising senior told CNN affiliate WLUC, a smile spread across his face. Eric's father, Dean Dompierre, told CNN that he hopes other states will follow Michigan's lead in offering an exception to sports age limits for students with disabilities. ""I feel relieved,"" Dean Dompierre told CNN in a telephone interview Thursday afternoon. ""It's been two and a half years. We've been petitioning and working with the association."" He said he's looking forward to ""just watching Eric run down onto the field in the first football game this fall. If he can contribute to the team, even better. The same goes for basketball season."" ""The hardest part has been the stress of not knowing whether or not it's going to be Eric's last season,"" he added. He said he is ""almost positive"" that his son will be granted a waiver in August. ""It was just a matter of keeping the faith and believing in what you're doing,"" Dean Dompierre told WLUC. ""I think things are meant to happen, and this was just meant to happen. That's all we wanted -- was just a shot at letting the schools actually decide for themselves as to how they want to run their sports programs, and this was how they want their sports programs run."" ""He's doing it because he loves me, because he just wants to watch me play sports in my last year,"" Eric Dompierre said. The student's underdog quest to keep playing sports in Michigan's Upper Peninsula garnered widespread attention because he has shown flashes of athletic prowess despite his Down syndrome, such as when he hit a three-point shot in the basketball playoffs to help his team maintain a comfortable lead. In football, he also kicked an extra point near the end of a game a couple of years ago. However, the athletic association's executive committee must first set up a waiver process, which is scheduled to be finalized in June, Johnson said. Once the process is established, Ishpeming High School can apply for the waiver for Dompierre in August, Johnson said. Without the waiver, Dompierre wouldn't be able to play sports next school year, he said. ""We fully expect Ishpeming High School will apply for a waiver,"" Johnson told CNN. The waiver provision is an amendment to the association's constitution. It allows student athletes who turn 19 before September to play sports under ""narrowly defined"" circumstances. Approval required a two-thirds majority of votes cast, and 94% of the 701 senior and junior high schools and middle schools that cast legal ballots approved the change, the association said. There are 1,535 schools in the association. Under the new waiver rule, a student ""must have a defined disability documented to diminish both physical and either intellectual or emotional capabilities, does not create a health or safety risk to participants, and does not create a competitive advantage for the team. The burden of proof rests with the school seeking the waiver,"" the association said in a statement. Said John E. ""Jack"" Roberts, the association's executive director, in a statement: ""Our challenge now is to demonstrate to the negative voters and to those many schools which didn't cast a vote at all, that this is a narrow gate that preserves the integrity of the program as effectively as the previous rule that was so well understood and respected."" The age restriction is intended to prevent the possibility of injury or competitive advantage from an older, more developed athlete playing against younger students. Dompierre turned 19 in January. He was held back in kindergarten because of his disability. The athletic association did not mention Dompierre by name, but it had recently released a statement that appeared intended to deflect criticism over the way it has handled the question of his participation. An online petition on Change.org that was started on March 24 now has more than 80,000 signatures. Yooper Shirts, a T-shirt store in Ishpeming, is selling shirts that say ""let 'em play."" The basement in the Dompierre home was transformed into a mini gym and is what the student refers to as his ""man-cave."" It contains a weight room, a net for him to practice kicking field goals, and a basketball hoop. Dompierre has played sports with other children in Ishpeming since he was in elementary school. ""We didn't know how far he'd go, how many coaches would keep him on the team,"" Dean Dompierre said earlier this month. When he got to high school, Eric Dompierre was invited to keep playing. As a junior, he was on the school football and basketball teams. He attended every practice, worked out with the other players and sometimes played a few minutes at the end of a game. During this season's basketball playoffs, Dompierre brought the house down. With the team maintaining a nice lead over rival Negaunee High School, the coach put Dompierre in the game and he hit a three-point shot. ""I was on the left side behind the three-point line and they passed me the ball,"" Dompierre said, smiling as he recounted the game in a recent interview. ""I heard the fans, including my mom crying."" Dompierre's father was in the stands with his camera and captured the reaction. ""I videotaped the crowd on the other side and it was made up of mostly Negaunee fans, including their student section, and they were all on their feet cheering for Eric."" Dompierre got a similar reaction two years ago when he kicked his first extra point for the football team toward the end of a game. ""I was amazed that he even had the opportunity to kick, and then when he did it, I thought woo-hoo! And then watching the kids react, they carried him off the field; it was just one of the best moments,"" Eric's mother, Jill Dompierre, recalled. For the past two years, the Dompierres, with the support of the Ishpeming School District, have tried to get the rule changed so Dompierre could play during his senior year. ""The rule is 100 years old,"" said Dean Dompierre. ""We've come a long way in those 100 years in this country in the way that we involve and include people with disabilities. And I think it's time that the rule catches up with that.""","The Michigan High School Athletic Association OKs a waiver provision .

"The extremist group ISIS ""probably"" won't be defeated under the current Obama administration, Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. ""This, as the President has said, is going to have to be a sustained effort,"" Blinken said. ""It's going to take time, and it will probably go beyond even this administration to get to the point of defeat."" Who is the ISIS? After the beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff by ISIS militants, Obama faced a chorus of bipartisan calls from Congress to act more aggressively and come up with a concrete strategy to combat ISIS, beyond the ongoing targeted airstrikes in Iraq. Nudges from Congress . Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson announced on Tuesday that he plans to introduce legislation making it clear the President has the authority for airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. Rep. Frank Wolf, a Republican from Virginia, said he plans to offer an even broader measure that gives the President the power to use military force against international terrorists. Last week, the Senate's top Republican told CNN that he would support congressional authorization for a new, broadened strategy to go after ISIS. ""In all likelihood, it would make sense for (President Obama) to get our support,"" said Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.  ""It's pretty clear ISIS is a serious threat. They have the potential to hit us here at home."" Still, House Speaker John Boehner is putting the onus on the President to present a strategy before Congress acts. ""The President is the commander in chief ... and it's his responsibility as the chief executive to outline a plan that will protect American interests, protect American lives -- both at home and abroad,"" Boehner said in a radio interview this week. ""Until the President is willing to lay out a plan, the Congress has very few options ahead of it,"" Boehner said. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy echoed the Speaker's concerns. ""First and foremost ... the President has to have a strategy.,"" McCarthy said Wednesday on the Hugh Hewitt radio show.  ""I mean what is our foreign policy?  I don't know what it is and if we don't know what it is and our allies don't know, and our enemies don't know so they are pushing the envelope."" Why it took Obama so long to address his no ISIS strategy comments . Clarifying his position . Speaking Wednesday, Obama addressed his much criticized statement last week that he has no strategy on ISIS in Syria. He said he was referring to a military strategy in Syria that ""might"" require congressional approval. ""Our objective is clear. That is to degrade and destroy (ISIS) so it's no longer a threat,"" he said. ""We can accomplish that. It's going to take some time, it's going to take some effort."" Biden warns ISIS: 'We will follow them to the gates of hell' The President said the world needs a regional strategy to defeat the group. ""We've been putting together a strategy that was designed to do a number of things... What we have to make sure is we have a regional strategy in place,"" he said.

"Twenty-four years. That's how much time must pass before the prime suspect in the disappearance of American Natalee Holloway faces the American justice system. Peru has agreed to extradite Joran van der Sloot to the United States, but only after he finishes serving a 28-year murder sentence, the Peruvian news agency Andina reported. The Peruvian court system sentenced him in 2012, but he will be eligible for release in 2038 because of the time he already has spent in custody. In the United States, he's been indicted on federal charges of extortion and wire fraud. American authorities accuse him of extorting money from Holloway's mother by offering bogus information about her daughter's disappearance. Holloway, an 18-year-old from Alabama, was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving a nightclub in Aruba with van der Sloot and two other men. She'd gone to the Caribbean island with 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Holloway's body has never been found, and she was declared legally dead in 2012. Nobody has been charged in her disappearance. The courts in Peru convicted van der Sloot in 2012 of murdering Stephany Flores, 21, in his Lima hotel room. The judges gave him a sentence two years short of the 30-year maximum. Investigators have said they believe van der Sloot, a 26-year-old Dutch national, killed Flores after she found something related to the Holloway case on his computer while visiting his hotel room. Van der Sloot confessed to robbery in addition to murder, admitting that he stole Flores' belongings, including more than $300 in local currency, credit cards and the victim's van as a means to leave the country. He fled to Chile and was arrested a few days later.","He's a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba .

""Rachel, here's my offer to you. If you want to graduate from high school and go to an HBCU, even if it's not in Florida but especially Florida ... If you want to do that, I want to help you do that,"" Joyner said during his radio show Tuesday, referring to historically black colleges and universities. ""I will help you get tutors to get you out of high school, tutors to help you pass the SAT, and I will give you a full-ride scholarship to any HBCU you'd like."" Juror: Zimmerman was 'justified' in shooting Martin . Jeantel, who said she might want to go into law enforcement, thanked Joyner. The host later appeared on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" Tuesday night. He described how Jeantel's life has been turned upside down in the past year and half by Martin's death and the trial. ""We talked to her people today and it's going to take some work, first of all to get her a high school diploma, and get her ready for the SAT test, and then entered into college.

"Accidentally brought your marijuana to the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport? Don't worry. Pitkin County Sheriff Joe DiSalvo plans to install amnesty boxes at the airport, possibly as soon as next week, for people traveling out of state. ""We'll have signs around the airport saying that although marijuana is legal in this state, it may be illegal in your final destination,"" DiSalvo told CNN. ""This is an opportunity to dispose of your marijuana with no legal consequences."" But don't try to fly with that marijuana, not even departing from the pot-happy states of Colorado and Washington. Both states allow adults 21 and older to have up to an ounce of marijuana, but those policies are at odds with federal law. Leave the brownies at home, too -- even in states where it's legal, it's not yet clear how marijuana-laced food is evaluated under those limits. The Transportation Security Administration seized 36 ounces of marijuana-laced food in a passenger's checked luggage at the Aspen airport earlier this month, and the federal agency referred the case to the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office, DiSalvo confirmed. (The edibles' amount of THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, was much less than the weight of the food. The sheriff's office declined to press charges.) The story was first reported in the Aspen Daily News. Colorado's recreational marijuana stores make history . In fact, the TSA has called the sheriff several times over the past six months to report passengers carrying marijuana and related products, DiSalvo said. His office offers to dispose of the product before passengers depart the state. ""Most everybody heeds our warnings,"" he said. The larger conflict is between state and federal law. While Colorado and Washington allow some marijuana use, federal law hasn't changed. And it's probably not a good idea to test the TSA or other federal agencies at the nation's airports. If they find a substance that violates federal law, they can refer possible violations to federal, state or local law enforcement in any state. Still, pot isn't exactly the TSA's top priority. Denver International Airport bans pot despite Colorado's new marijuana law . ""TSA's focus is on terrorism and security threats to the aircraft and its passengers,"" TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein wrote in a statement. ""TSA's screening procedures, which are governed by federal law, are focused on security and are designed to detect potential threats to aviation and passengers. As has always been the case, if during the security screening procedures an officer discovers an item that may violate the law, TSA refers the matter to law enforcement. Law enforcement officials will determine whether to initiate a criminal investigation."" It can be hard to sort out the competing state and federal regulations, especially for the dazed and confused passenger. The Colorado Springs airport has already placed amnesty boxes for people to get rid of their marijuana before clearing security or getting on an airplane. The Denver International Airport decided not to play with pot, banning the substance entirely at the airport, a spokeswoman confirmed. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport doesn't ban legal amounts of marijuana at the airport. That's because Washington state law doesn't allow facilities to add any additional regulation, airport spokesperson Perry Cooper said. A word of caution to Super Bowl fans from Colorado and Washington: Don't try to take your marijuana to less pot-friendly states. We know your (possible) cannabis consumption won't get in the way of the game, but consider where the Super Bowl is being played. If your pot makes it to your destination, you could be dealing with the Port Authority of New York and police guarding Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in New York and Newark airport in New Jersey. How do you think will they react if your goods are discovered? ""If they're possessing contraband in New York or New Jersey,"" Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo said, ""the prevailing laws would apply.""

"For one, it was a health scare.  For another, the words of a friend hit him in an instant. And for another, it was the loss of a dear relative. Many ex-smokers can remember their last cigarette, and the moment when they decided to quit the habit for good. On the occasion of Thursday's Great American Smokeout, an annual event sponsored by the American Cancer Society, here's a look at nine former smokers and the moment they decided it was time to say goodbye. 'Smoked out of good health' Kara Wethington's 66-year-old grandmother had just died. Wethington took one final drag on a cigarette. It was 2000, and she decided this would be her last smoke. ""I was shocked because this woman was an ox who smoked four packs of Pall Mall cigarettes a day and worked full time as a nurse,"" said the Los Angeles resident, who was 23 at the time. ""I always felt safe that this blood line relative could smoke like a chimney and still be OK all these years later. She looked 100 but acted 60."" But, ""the reality of it is that she fell ill with pneumonia and her lungs couldn't support her any longer."" As she finished her last cigarette, Wethington reflected on how she got there. ""I loved smoking. The social aspect of it, the taste of it, the way it made me feel -- everything about it was romantic to me."" But the death of her grandmother was the ""straw that broke the camel's back"" soon after Wethington herself was diagnosed with an aggressive form of strep throat, and she hasn't looked back for 13 years. ""I've had smoking dreams that felt so intimately real that the line of reality and fantasy blurred out my memory. I know I didn't smoke but sometimes those dreams feel really good and sometimes with real regret."" When 'trying to fit in' led to a health scare . Lisa Gonsalves' last cigarette is a blur compared to the ""health perfect storm"" she was hit with in 2005. At first, it seemed like a winter flu, but as the new year came, she found she couldn't breathe unless she sat in a chair. She was almost too late to be treated. ""I ended up in the hospital for 12 days with two chest tubes and the potential of having my chest cracked open just to get the 'gunk' out of my chest. I was lucky to get back to health and avoid surgery. My recovery was long and tedious."" Her husband had never seen her so sick. ""The look of panic and helplessness convinced me that I had to stop."" Like many former smokers, it was the last of many potential turning points for the Los Angeles health care consultant, who started smoking as a teenager to fit in. The first was having a baby, the second and third moments were her mother's stroke (at age 50) and grandmother's heart attack. ""It took me a while to realize I was a stress and social smoker,"" she said. ""Pressure from work and going out to happy hours fueled my habit, but smoking made me feel better for just a moment. What is worse is that I knew better. I worked in health care and saw the effects of long-term smoking."" ""I can't say that I don't crave it - especially when I am stressed out.  I do have to constantly remind myself of the pain and the feeling of drowning because I couldn't breathe to keep me from running out and getting a pack.  It is a very mental game I play every day but I get stronger and stronger every day without a cigarette."" Words that changed his life . When Bob Miller smoked his last cigarette, he knew right away that this was it. The words from one of his friends ""hit me like a ton of bricks."" After a gradual process of trying to quit in 2006, she said, ""You know, Bob, there never is a good day to quit smoking, is there?"" The Easley, South Carolina, assembly instructor admits, ""There are still times when I think that I would like a smoke but there is no way that I will do it. ... I do feel better and definitely smell better."" Quitting 'at any age' Ash Li (the iReporter did not want her last name revealed) of Springfield, Tennessee, smoked her final cigarette as soon as she learned that airlines were banning it. A frequent flier, she couldn't bear to remain addicted while flying, and knew she was unable to do anything about it. So on July 9, 1992, after seven years of smoking two packs a day, she quit for good. ""I have not had a cigarette since that day, but when someone lights up near me I take a deep breath,"" she said. ""That first puff of smoke off a cigarette still gets me, but then everything afterwards repels me. I am the worst ex-smoker, I can't stand to be around anyone who smokes or has smoked nor get into an enclosed space with a smoker."" She was very concerned when her daughter took up smoking, afraid she would fall into the same habits. But as we reported this story, she had good news to share. ""I am elated to report that my daughter has quit smoking and using the new electronic vapor cigarettes that are out there. She is not coughing as much as she used to and her voice is clearer. I really hope that these vapor cigarette products do not create any health hazards that have not been discovered yet. In the meantime I encourage her to stick with the vapor and stay away from the cancer sticks."" A Valentine's present to himself . Pizza restaurant owner Paul Tamasi makes themed pies to show how he feels about a certain topic. He recently made one with a ""no smoking"" symbol to remind himself of February 14, 1985. On that Valentine's Day, Tamasi tossed his final cigarette into a barrel. He was quitting a habit of smoking two packs a day for 20 years, going back to age 13. ""I was positive and determined that this would be my last cigarette,"" he said. ""I would buy two packs a day and sometimes run out.  Then I would bum some from my co-worker.  One day, I asked to bum a cigarette from her and she said to me, 'Why don't you just buy more cigarettes?'  That's when I really realized that I had a serious problem.  I said to myself, that's it, I have to do something about this."" So why Valentine's Day? ""I picked this day because I knew if I succeeded I would always be able to remember the day I stopped smoking,"" the Belvidere, Vermont, resident explained. He felt a weight lifted off his shoulders and still feels that way 28 years later. ""When I was smoking and played sports my chest felt like it was going to cave in and it was hard to breathe. Now I don't get that bad feeling because I don't smoke anymore. Needless to say, I have a lot more money in my pocket than I would if I had to pay the high price of what cigarettes cost."" Cinnamon and cigarettes . Her final cigarette was one she saw coming, and Linda Parker was ready to take the dive. After a three week course sponsored by the American Lung Association, she had to give up her cigarettes and her lighter. She took that final smoke, then moved on to cinnamon hearts, jawbreakers and the like to fulfill the need for the hot cigarette sensation. She was determined to do it, though, after her mother received her sixth pacemaker and her father was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Her son had been diagnosed with Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease, which affects the hips. Doctors told her it may have come from her smoking. ""My first two weeks (not smoking) were easy but then on the third week, I felt like I was going to die. I hadn't slept much, wasn't dreaming, was super irritable and ate like a pig."" That was 20 years ago. Yet she continued to struggle for many of those years. ""It took me years to stop dreaming about having a cigarette and sometimes I would wake up and not be sure if I had smoked,"" she said. ""Luckily, I have never had another cigarette, not even a puff."" The retired Flossmoor, Illinois, resident told herself she could return to smoking at age 65. Yet Parker just turned 65 this month. ""It was too difficult to quit and the damage smoking does isn't worth the pleasure it provides.""","On the annual 'Great American Smokeout,' ex-smokers share the story of their last cigarette .

Tiger Woods says it is an ""incredible relief"" to be over his injury problems and is now concentrating on adding to his 14 major titles next year. Woods, who turns 39 on December 30, failed to make the cut at the U.S. PGA in August after struggling to retain full fitness following surgery on a pinched nerve in his back earlier in the year. The U.S. star made a return to action earlier in December at the Hero World Challenge, the tournament he hosts every year at his home course of Isleworth in Florida. But the former World No.1 was unable to finish after being physically ill during his third round, leaving him joint last. Writing on his end of year blog, Woods said: ""I'm mostly excited about being healthy again. I've struggled for the past year-and-half with my back, and it showed in my results. ""Even though I won five times two years ago, it was hit or miss some weeks and got progressively worse. Now that it feels healthy, strong and stable, it's fun to be able to play with my kids again, to play soccer and run around with them, shoot hoops ... things that I used to do and took for granted. ""For anybody who has ever had a bad back with nerve damage, it's downright debilitating. To not feel that is finally just incredible relief."" Woods, who won the last of his major titles in 2008, will spend the holiday season with his children and partner, Lindsey Vonn. Ski star Vonn, who missed out on equaling the all-time record for the number of World Cup race wins last weekend, has had injury problems of her own. Vonn was forced to undergo knee surgery earlier this year and missed out on defending her Olympic downhill crown at the Sochi Olympics. Speaking to CNN earlier this year, Vonn revealed how Woods had played a key role in helping her through a difficult time when he too was struggling for fitness. ""Tiger and I both went through rehab with our injuries at a similar time, so we were both in the gym together and pushing each other and motivating each other, both frustrated,"" Vonn told CNN's Alpine Edge last month. ""I think we both helped each other a lot through that time, and I drew a lot of inspiration from him and I think he does the same with me. ""We continue to push each other and it's a really positive relationship in that way.""","Tiger Woods hoping to bounce back in 2015 .

"Steven Sotloff, the American journalist beheaded by ISIS militants, got the last word during a memorial service in his honor Friday. Passages from two letters written by Sotloff during his captivity and smuggled out of Syria were read aloud before hundreds of relatives, friends, colleagues and officials who packed the public service at Temple Beth Am in Pinecrest, Florida, outside Miami. ""Everyone has two lives. A second one begins when you realize you only have one,"" one letter said in part. ""Hug each other every day.  Please know I am OK. Live your lives to the fullest and pray to be happy."" The 31-year-old freelance journalist disappeared during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2013 and was later determined to have been abducted. On Tuesday, ISIS posted a video online showing one of its members beheading Sotloff. The grisly killing provoked international outrage at the Islamic terror group that refers to itself as the Islamic State. The group seeks to establish an Islamic state, a caliphate, in parts of Syria and Iraq. It is not clear how Sotloff's letters, read by his relatives, made it into his family's hands. During the service, Sotloff's father, Art, choked up with emotion as he spoke of his son. ""I will try to speak from my heart but my heart is broken,"" the father said. ""I lost my son and my best friend. ""He is done suffering."" Sotloff's mother, Shirley, said she was proud her son got to live his dream. ""I may not have him physically, but I will always have him in my heart,"" she said. Among more than 900 attendees were Florida Gov. Rick Scott, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. Sotloff's family accuses ISIS leader of violating Islam with execution . Sotloff grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He attended high school at a New England boarding school, Kimball Union Academy in New Hampshire. In the program for Friday's service, Sotloff's sister shared lyrics from Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here,"" which the family said stirred their memories of Sotloff. At one point in the service, the song played, and mourners wept and sang softly to the music, using the lyric sheet. His sister, Lauren, expressed her loss. ""Dear Steven, I love you very much. ... You were my best friend,"" she said. ""You introduced me to the 'X-Files' and 'Freaks and Geeks.'"" Rubio said the slain war correspondent ""chose not to just be a journalist but one to report where horrible things happen."" ""It was to bring to us stories about the people who were suffering unbelievable acts,"" Rubio said. ""Evil is still here. It has a different name but it's still here, and he unmasked it.""

"Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says it's hypocritical to oppose school vouchers while sending your children to private school. (CNN) -- When President Obama signs the $410 billion omnibus spending bill, there will be shouts of joy from both sides as Republicans and Democrats get their cherished earmarks. Yet tucked into that bill is an amendment pushed by the president's former colleague in the Senate, Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin, who used his influence to essentially kill the District of Columbia school vouchers program. Oh sure, it will be portrayed that the Democrats aren't killing the program, but the initiative calls for no new students to be allowed entry, unless approved by Congress and the District of Columbia  City Council. And considering that the teachers union has such a death grip on both Democratic-controlled institutions, you can forget about that happening. Democrats say they believe in school choice, but they don't fully accept the gamut of choices. They will happily tout charter schools, also opposed by the national teachers unions, but stop at vouchers. Why? Because Republicans have consistently advocated for vouchers, and Democrats have convinced themselves that vouchers will somehow destroy the public school infrastructure. Now, some believe the Obama administration is sending mixed signals because Education Secretary Arne Duncan has said he doesn't want to see kids thrown out of Washington schools who are already in the existing voucher program. Fine. But the reality is that after this year, no new kids will be allowed to enroll in the program, and that folks, is killing the program. Obama and his party have never been fans of vouchers. Why? They contend that vouchers would hurt the public school system. Vouchers allow parents who can't afford private school to remove their children from public schools in order to get a better education. Well, isn't that what the president and those in his party do themselves by sending their children to private school? Only they don't need the government's help. The standard fallback position of Democrats and the Obama administration is that the Washington program only helps 1,700 children a year, and those who don't qualify are stuck in a sorry system, and they are largely poor and minority. They contend that since every student can't be helped by vouchers, none should be helped. So parents and children are supposed to sit tight and wait on the promised reform to trickle down from Washington to the local school systems, and then all will be well? To me, that's sort of like saying that historically African-Americans are likely to have high rates of diabetes and hypertension, so instead of launching a program to save some from developing the disease, let's wait for a comprehensive plan where all can be saved at one time. Sorry, folks. I believe you save as many as you can now, and continue to save the rest later. This shouldn't be an either/or proposition, but an and/both situation. The other fundamental problem here is that we have a bunch of politicians deciding what's best for education over the objections of actual educators! For instance, Democrats have had high praise for the superintendent of schools in Washington, Michelle Rhee. Just one problem: she supports vouchers. ""I don't think vouchers are going to solve all the ills of public education, but parents who are zoned to schools that are failing kids should have options to do better by their kids,"" she told The New York Times. So if Rhee backs them, why not give her the vote of confidence to continue the program while she tries to fix the ailing school system? The education reform outlined by President Obama on Tuesday is necessary. But we are a long way from seeing the kind of systemic changes that will fix our public schools. His plan goes far on personal and parental responsibility, yet relies on states to enact their own measures of change, and with 50 different state school plans, we know that is a disaster waiting to happen. I would have more confidence if President Obama and members of Congress truly walked the walk and sent their kids to public schools. If they have so much faith in them turning around with reform, entrust their own children to public education. That's the kind of confidence our system needs. If it's good enough for yours, then surely it's good enough for mine. But preaching to the rest of us about the virtues of a public education, then sending your own children to private school and denying the use of vouchers so others can do the same, is frankly hypocritical. I know the value of a public education, and went to such institutions for elementary, middle, high school and college. Yet looking at the sorry state public schools are in now, maybe seeing kids leave in droves via vouchers will force school administrators and teachers to stop thinking they have all the answers and allow for innovation and full accountability, from the classroom to the boardroom. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: Omnibus spending bill essentially kills Washington school vouchers .

"Four-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams was taken to the brink by China's Zheng Jie before earning a place in the last 16 Saturday. Williams needed two and a half hours on Centre Court to subdue her 25th seeded opponent, who had reached the semifinals at the All England Club four years ago as a wild card. On the way she had beaten the American superstar and came close to pulling off another upset after taking the first set tiebreak. But back came Williams to level before a grueling final set in which Zheng showed her typical determination. Serving second, she continued to hold until the 15th game when her sixth seeded opponent broke through. Zheng saved two match points before Williams sealed a clash against Yaroslava Shvedova for a place in the last eight. ""We always have unbelievable matches together and I knew it was going to be tough,"" Williams told BBC Sport after her win. Earlier Shvedova had created Wimbledon and WTA history in a remarkable first set against French Open runner up Sara Errani of Italy. Shvedova took every point, 24 without reply, to break her own record of 23 set in Memphis in 2006. It was the first time a so-called Golden Set had been achieved in Grand Slam history. Errani restored some pride in the second set but still slipped to a 6-0 6-4 defeat. Defending champion Petra Kvitova continued her serene progress into the second week with a 6-1 6-0 romp against Varvara Lepchenko of the United States. Second seed Victoria Azarenka of the Belarus also had an easy passage, beating Jana Cepelova of Slovakia 6-2 6-3. And former World No.1 Ana Ivanovic of Serbia showed her improved form as she beat Julia Goerges of Germany 3-6 6-3 6-4.","Serena Williams taken to three sets by Zheng Jie .

"Horrific events brought them together. He was the first person to undergo a full face transplant in the United States after an electrical accident left him without a nose, eyes or lips. She suffered burns on more than 70% of her body after a car crash. After meeting in a hospital support group for burn victims, Dallas Wiens and Jamie Nash got married on Saturday, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. ""I am Dallas' eyes while he has my heart,"" Nash said in a recent online post about their relationship. Wiens, 27, was injured in 2008 when he was volunteering at his church and his head got too close to a high-voltage power line. He lost almost his entire face from the burns. In 2011, doctors at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital gave him a new one. In a 15-hour procedure, doctors used donated tissue to give Wiens a donor forehead, nasal structure, nose, lips and facial skin. They also transplanted underlying muscles and nerves that will allow Wiens to have sensation and movement in his face. The historic surgery marked a dramatic recovery for a man that had been kept in a medically induced coma for 90 days. Some people hadn't expected him to make it out of intensive care. Nash endured a similar struggle. She was texting while driving when her car crashed in 2010. Flames burned her arms to the bone and severed her Achilles tendon. Doctors kept her in an induced coma for 10 weeks. She underwent more than two dozen surgeries. Now, Nash has created a nonprofit, the Jamie Nash TXT L8R Foundation, to tell her story and warn people against texting while driving. On the foundation's website, she described her growing romance with Wiens. ""I would truly feel lost without him by my side,"" she wrote last year. ""Our love is deep and strong, and together we will achieve greatness."" According to WFAA, they plan to share their wedding footage in a reality show about people who survive tragedies and go on to help others.","Dallas Wiens and Jamie Nash, both severe burn victims, marry .

"A film that features a dance routine inspired by Karl Marx and examines African art has won Britain's most prestigious and controversial art prize. The Turner Prize, which is worth £25,000 ($40,000), was awarded to the Irish film artist Duncan Campbell in a glittering ceremony last night. His film, It For Others, which was described by the panel as ""an ambitious and complex film which rewards repeated viewing"", is a response to a ""film essay"" from 1953 about African art and colonialism. This archive footage is interspersed with new material, including a dance routine based on the equations in Karl Marx's seminal work, ""Das Kapital,"" created by the choreographer Michael Clark. All of this is overlaid with a voiceover that imitates the style of a lecture. Inevitable controversy . The critical response has been largely hostile, with commentators describing Campbell's video as ""overlong,"" ""baffling,"" and ""hectoring."" The judging panel, however, admired the artist's ""exceptional dedication to making a work which speaks about the construction of value and meaning in ways that are topical and compelling."" Campbell was the bookmaker's favorite. He topped a four-person shortlist that included James Richards, Ciara Phillips and Tris Vonna-Michell to win the coveted prize. The artist described winning the award as ""surreal,"" but acknowledged that ""this money will make a huge difference."" ""Even being nominated for the prize has given me great heart,"" he said. Some critics have, however, been vocal in their condemnation of Campbell's winning video. Media debate . Digby Warde-Aldam, the art critic for the UK's Spectator magazine, said: ""Surely no arbiter in their right mind could have let such hectoring, cultural studies-sanctioned guff slip through the net?"" ""If you're serious about the rubbish on show this year, you are insulting every artist working in Britain today,"" he said. The Guardian newspaper, based in London, acknowledged that Campbell has produced ""the most consistently interesting body of work of all four shortlisted artists,"" but described his winning, 54-minute video as ""overlong,"" ""over-complicated,"" and ""more like a lecture than an artwork."" And the Telegraph newspaper quoted the director of the Tate Britain, Penelope Curtis, as saying that the video was ""a bit baffling"" and ""quite odd."" Campbell, who lives in Scotland, is a graduate of the Glasgow School of Art. He is the fourth alumni of the school to have won the prize in the last 10 years. The school's director, Professor Tom Inns, described Campbell's success as ""a great accolade both for Duncan and for the Glasgow School of Art.""

"Six world powers and Iran have reached a deal on the framework for comprehensive negotiations over Tehran's nuclear program, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Thursday. ""We have identified all of the issues we need to address in reaching a comprehensive and final agreement,"" Ashton said, speaking alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in Vienna, Austria. ""There is a lot to do. It won't be easy, but we've made a good start"" following ""three very productive days"" of talks,  Ashton added. In addition to political discussions, the two sides have started technical work, Ashton said, and have set a timetable for meetings over the next four months, with a framework for further deliberations. Technical experts will meet in early March, she said, and the next round of talks between the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- and Iran will start March 17. Zarif then delivered the same statement in Persian. The latest talks began Tuesday. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Wednesday the meetings had been ""constructive and useful."" Interim deal . The latest talks come after an interim deal was forged in November, under which Iran agreed to roll back parts of its nuclear program in return for relief from some sanctions. That agreement came into effect in January. The challenge now is to reach a permanent deal acceptable to all sides. The United States and its allies believe Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon, while Tehran has said its atomic efforts are peaceful. Wendy Sherman, a senior State Department official and lead negotiator for the United States on the interim deal, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer from Vienna this week that any final agreement will be contingent on Iran taking ""concrete"" verifiable steps that prevent it from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon. Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi insisted Tuesday that the ""halting of Iran's (nuclear) program and dismantling Iran's nuclear facilities are not on the agenda,"" the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. Harf said specific issues such as dismantlement would be on the table in later discussions. ""We know both sides come to the negotiating table with certain positions in mind, clearly, but we do think that we have made some progress over these last few days and, hopefully, can continue to build on that going forward,"" she told reporters in Washington.","""We have identified all of the issues we need to address"" for final deal, says Ashton .

"(CNN) -- Just 12 miles south of the spot where a police officer killed Michael Brown, it happened again: Another 18-year-old died at the hands of police Wednesday. An off-duty officer opened fire on the teen, and the policeman didn't stop until he'd fired his weapon 17 times, authorities say. Anger erupted among residents, who damaged police cars, and they pointed to what they felt were parallels to the Brown shooting. But in reality, the similarities are slim. Yes, the teen was black. And the officer was white. Yes, the officer fired several times. And it all unfolded in the St. Louis metro area. But the commonalities end there. In this case, the 18-year-old was armed, and he fired on the officer first, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said. The death comes on the heels of the Brown shooting two months ago in the suburb of Ferguson, and just ahead of a ""Weekend of Resistance"" in St. Louis, where activists will push for movement in the investigation into that case. Tensions are already high in the community, and it's uncertain how the latest shooting will affect its mood. ""At the scene of yet another young man's death,"" tweeted St. Louis Alderman Antonio French. ""This happens too often in our city. It's a crisis that we should all be concerned about."" An animated crowd quickly gathered late Wednesday near the site close to the Missouri Botanical Garden, chanting slogans as St. Louis police officers stood by. ""Hey, hey, ho, ho, these killer cops have got to go,"" the crowd chanted, repurposing a popular chant from the Brown protests. The confrontations with police were intense and laced with profanity. ""That was somebody's baby,"" screamed one man, referring to the man who was killed. ""Think about your own child,"" pleaded another person in the crowd. Despite the tensions, Dotson said no businesses were looted and no windows were smashed. He praised officers for showing a ""tremendous amount of restraint"" as members of the crowd confronted them face-to-face and damaged police cruisers. Complete coverage of Ferguson . The officer, a six-year veteran of the force, was working a second job for a security company, one that was approved by his department. He was wearing his police uniform. While on patrol, the officer saw three black males run away as he approached. He gave chase because one of them was holding up his pants in a way that made the officer believe the teen may be carrying a gun, Dotson said. The officer and one of the three tussled. The teen ran off, then turned around and fired at least three shots at the officer, Dotson said. The officer returned fire, killing the teen. Police recovered a 9 mm handgun. And Dotson said the teen was ""no stranger to law enforcement."" He didn't offer details, citing privacy concerns. The two other males have not been apprehended. In August, the death of the unarmed Brown fueled protests and sparked a nationwide debate on police use of force. Protesters are planning a series of demonstrations, rallies and events in Ferguson and St. Louis this weekend to call for an end to racial profiling and what they call police violence. This weekend's protests start with a rally outside the office of the prosecutor investigating the Brown shooting. Demonstrators will call for Bob McCulloch to step aside and allow a special prosecutor to be appointed. Additional marches and demonstrations will mark the weekend, along with ""civil disobedience actions around the St. Louis region,"" according to a statement from organizers that also says thousands of people from across the country are expected. CNN's Dave Alsup, Tony Marco and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Police: Officer fired at least 17 shots, the suspect at least 3 .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- America's top diplomat for Afghanistan and Pakistan says the deadly Taliban insurgency in those countries relies heavily on funding from the Persian Gulf region. U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke chats with U.A.E. counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Such money even outpaces the cash gathered from Afghanistan's multibillion-dollar exports of opium and heroin, said Richard Holbrooke, the United States' special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, in an interview Tuesday with CNN. ""It seems to be more from individuals carrying money in their suitcases,"" Holbrooke said. ""Sometimes they are taking advantage of the pilgrimage [to the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia]. Sometimes from hawala [an informal international system for money transfers]. Sometimes from charities. ""It is an important part of the war. ... The Taliban is not a high-tech expensive organization."" U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan have suffered high losses this summer at the hands of Taliban insurgents. Holbrooke gave the interview to CNN on the sidelines of a Friends of Democratic Pakistan meeting in Istanbul. The meeting was attended by delegations from more than a dozen countries and international organizations, including the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Turkey, Sweden, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Iran. Members of the American and Iranian delegations walked past each other in the ornate marble halls of the 19th century Ottoman palace on the banks of the Bosporus Strait where the meeting took place, but did not interact openly in the picturesque venue. Holbrooke missed a group photo attended by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, one aide said, due to a problem of miscommunication. And Holbrooke said that, due to a bilateral meeting with another delegation, he was not in the conference room when the Iranian diplomat delivered remarks. He insisted he was not deliberately avoiding his Iranian counterpart. ""I saw them, they were in the room,"" Holbrooke said. ""The Iranian made generally positive statements ... about supporting a democratic Pakistan."" Diplomats said much of Tuesday's meeting focused on rebuilding parts of northwestern Pakistan damaged when another round of fighting broke out between Taliban insurgents and the Pakistani military last spring. The conflict forced more than a million Pakistanis to flee their homes. Holbrooke said one of the top priorities of the Obama administration in the region has been to help Afghanistan hold presidential elections, which took place on August 20. That election was marred by Taliban violence, which claimed the lives of at least 26 people on election day. Opposition candidates have accused the government of incumbent president Hamid Karzai of fraud and the stuffing of ballot boxes, charges Karzai officials deny. ""That's politics, Afghan-style,"" Holbrooke told CNN. ""That happens in Western democracies as well. We have charges repeatedly in American elections by candidates that the other side is not allowing [would-be voters] to register. We should not be surprised that democracy is imperfect even in Western countries. And Afghanistan has had unique difficulties in holding this election. So let's see what happens."" Holbrooke is urging observers to wait for the results of an investigation by Afghanistan's Electoral Complaints Commission.","Persian Gulf area is key source of money for Taliban, U.S. diplomat tells CNN .

"The world has devoted a great deal of diplomatic energy to securing Syria's chemical weapons. It has yet to do the same for securing Syria's children. Their future is as important for international security and stability, even if the consequences of inaction will take far longer to be seen and felt. The war in Syria between the government of Bashar al-Assad and forces opposed to him has ground on for more than two years and claims new victims each day.  More than 100,000 have been killed. Starvation has become a gruesome reality, with a religious leader now saying it is OK to eat cats and dogs given the lack of much of anything else. Polio, likely brought by foreign fighters, has resurfaced to claim tiny victims younger than 2. In the past two weeks, barrel bombs -- drums filled with shrapnel and explosives -- are reported to have killed more than 500 people in the city of Aleppo. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group with links to Syrian opposition, children accounted for more than 150 of the dead. Refugees fleeing the conflict, most to Syria's overwhelmed neighbors Jordan and Lebanon, top a whopping 2 million. Some U.N. officials expect that number to climb as high as 4 million in 2014. More than 1.1 million of these refugees are younger than 18. Indeed, Syria's youngest citizens are paying dearly for a war they did not create, one that is laying waste to their present and their future. Three out of four Syrian children ""have lost a close friend or family member in their country's ongoing conflict"" and ""many have witnessed violence,"" notes the International Rescue Committee.  Charities such as IRC and Mercy Corps working with Syria's children tell of young people isolated, lonely and struggling with the impossible task of coming to terms with all that they have seen and lost. ""If we do not act quickly, a generation of innocents will become lasting casualties of an appalling war,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres said in November when releasing a report on the grim future facing Syria's children. ""A grave consequence of the conflict is that a generation is growing up without a formal education,"" the report said.  ""More than half of all school-aged Syrian children in Jordan and Lebanon are not in school. In Lebanon, it is estimated that some 200,000 school-aged Syrian refugee children could remain out of school at the end of the year.""  They join 25 million kids of primary-school-age around the world out of school because of war. These numbers matter and well beyond Syria's borders. As U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan has often noted, security and education are bound together: Low educational attainment is among the strongest predictors of violence.  Anyone hoping for a safer, more secure world had better start with educating children. And yet until now, the international community's reaction to the escalating death count and the rising number of hungry, homeless and displaced children has fallen somewhere between a shrug and a sigh. Although U.N. agencies have released a slew of dire warnings about the situation's urgency and its gravity, it is unclear anyone is listening, let alone ready to act to change the calculus on the ground. In September, a round of feverish and focused diplomacy unfolded between Russia and the United States to reach a deal with the Assad regime on its chemical weapons. No nations have engaged in such fully concentrated diplomacy to open and secure humanitarian corridors and bring supplies to cities being starved and cut off from the rest of the world -- and to make sure Syria's children don't go hungry. Although chemical weapons may be close to being secured, conventional weapons face no such limitations and are being used to kill, injure and maim with impunity. This leaves children to pay the price.  And so will the rest of us, eventually, if nothing is done to help a lost generation find a way to a more secure future.","Gayle Lemmon: Nations have tried to secure Syria's chemical weapons but not to help children .

"A 20-minute drive from Kiev takes you to a neighborhood that feels more like Beverly Hills than central Ukraine. In a quiet oasis, huge mansions sit on lush lawns behind gilded gates. Private security guards stand watch over quiet, tree-lined streets. You'd never know you're in a country in the midst of a violent conflict, with near daily reports of intense battles killing soldiers, pro-Russian separatists, and civilians -- including children. These are the mansions that rose when the Soviet Union fell. And this is where many of Kiev's new rich are riding out the crisis, far from the front lines of eastern Ukraine. Here, we find Kiev millionaire Vyacheslav Konstantinovsky sitting nervously on his grandiose outdoor patio. He is surrounded by the spoils of a successful construction business and restaurant chain. Konstantinovsky -- with a shaved head, tattoos, and muscled physique -- doesn't look like your stereotypical fat cat millionaire.  He looks tough, rugged -- and fearful for his country. ""If we sit and enjoy life here the [the war] will come to us also,"" he tells me. Konstantinovsky worries about the struggling Ukrainian military. For years it had been ill equipped, untrained, and underfunded. Now, he and his twin brother are part of a growing group of Ukraine's mega rich making massive military contributions. Konstantinovsky has donated $450,000 -- a figure funded, in part, by the sale of his Rolls Royce Phantom -- to the military to supply soldiers with weapons, uniforms, and supplies. ""I can live without [my] Rolls Royce. But now it's difficult to live without enough arms,"" he says. According to Forbes, seven of Ukraine's 100 richest people have publicly donated to the military.  Prosecutors are investigating others on the Forbes list for financing pro-Russian rebels. The United Nations says more than 2,000 people have died in eastern Ukraine since mid-April. Many are civilian volunteers, who left their families and jobs to join the fight. What sets Konstantinovsky apart from other wealthy Ukranian donors is the 53-year-old's background as a Soviet soldier. Now, he is a member of Ukraine's volunteer battalions. ""If we don't fight, than we will be humiliated and we will live in the same country as it was before, when there was corruption. [The old government] was robbing businesses, they were putting people in jail for nothing,"" he says. He's already done one rotation in Donetsk, and plans to return to the front lines. He knows that each day, volunteers like him die -- yet is ready to send his wife and children abroad, leave his mansion and join the fight. ""Of course I worry. But I hope for good luck,"" he says. He hopes for a fast end to the fighting and the birth of a new, stronger Ukraine. He hopes for a country with more jobs, and more millionaires like him. ""First we have to finish the war.

"The body of an Iraqi woman, whose brutal beating death may have been a hate crime, will be flown home for burial. Shaima Alawadi, a 32-year-old mother of five, died of a severe head injury after the attack at her home in southern California March 21.  A note beside the body told the family to go back to Iraq and called them ""terrorists,"" her daughter said. Alawadi, who was hospitalized in critical condition after the beating, was taken off life support Saturday. A memorial service will be held Tuesday at her home, organized by the local Muslim community. The U.S. State Department Tuesday expressed its condolences to Alawadi's family. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland called the attack an ""absolutely brutal beating,"" and said ""authorities are continuing to search for motives behind this attack, but the United States has no tolerance for wanton acts of violence like this."" Late Monday night, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said Alawadi's body would be taken to Iraq for a funeral and burial. Hanif Mohebi, executive director of the organization that advocates for Muslim civil liberties, said he did not know exactly when the funeral will take place, but believed the Iraqi government was footing the bill to transport the body. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said the Iraqi government had not requested help in repatriating Alawadi to Iraq, but were willing to assist if asked. Alawadi and her husband have three daughters and two sons, ranging in age from 8 to 17, Mohebi said. They moved to the San Diego County area in 1995 and then briefly lived in Dearborn, Michigan, before moving back to California. Both El Cajon, where the family lived, and Dearborn have sizable Iraqi communities -- among the nation's largest. Alwadai's teenage daughter found her mother unconscious in the dining area of their home last week. The note lay beside her body, Fatima Al Himidi told CNN affiliate KGTV. Nothing was stolen from the house. Police have not disclosed the contents of the note, but called it ""threatening."" ""Based on the content of the note, we are not ruling out the possibility that this may be a hate crime,"" city Police Chief Jim Redman said Monday. ""Other evidence,"" however, leads investigators to remain open to other possibilities, he said. ""The possibility that this is a hate crime is just one aspect of what we are examining."" Although the investigation is ""still in the early stages"" and police ""have not drawn any conclusions,"" Redman did say evidence leads them to ""strongly believe that this was an isolated incident."" The chief would not describe that evidence. Detectives obtained a search warrant for the family's home because a court order is ""just the best way to recover evidence,"" Redman said. Al Himidi told KGTV that a similar note was left outside the family home earlier in the month, but the family did not report it. Police confirmed it. ""A week ago they left a letter saying, 'This is our country, not yours, you terrorists,'"" she said over the weekend. ""So my mom ignored that, thinking (it was) kids playing around, pranking. And so the day they hurt her, they left it again and it said the same thing."" Mohebi said the family was holding up as best as they could, amid an outpouring of support from the community. ""But they're also emotionally realizing that yes, their mother is no longer with them. And that's heartbreaking,"" he said. Social media users quickly compared Alawadi's death to that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, calling both hate crimes, and drawing a parallel between a hijab and a hoodie. Martin was killed last month as he walked back to the house of his father's fiancee in Sanford, Florida, after a trip to the convenience store. Police say he was shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who said he was acting in self defense and has not been charged. The teen was unarmed, carrying a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea, and was wearing a hoodie.","The State Department expressed its condolences .

"Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili conceded his party's defeat Tuesday, setting the stage for the nation's first peaceful, democratic transition through election since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Victory in the parliamentary elections went to a coalition headed by billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili. Ivanishvili is set to become the next prime minister. Saakashvili will remain president until presidential elections next year. The result of Monday's election means Georgia will have a multi-party parliament, boosting democracy in the nation, observers said. The vote also is a reflection of how the people feel about Saakashvili. He took power in 2004 after the Rose Revolution, the name given to widespread protests over disputed parliamentary elections. Saakashvili is credited with having changed the country by moving toward integration with the West, with steps such as seeking membership in the European Union and NATO. He also revamped the nation's economy, retooling it to reflect a free market system. But critics said that beneath the surface, his government was dominated by Soviet-style ""administrative measures."" Ivanishvili, whose Georgian Dream alliance won a majority of seats in the 150-member parliament, said the new government would seek to mend the country's troubled relations with Russia. The two nations fought a brief but bitter war four years ago over the breakaway region of South Ossetia. ""Restoring relations with the Kremlin is one of our main tasks and we will strive in every way to do this,"" he told CNN. ""I think it's achievable but not easy. First we have to convince the Kremlin that our strategy toward NATO and Europe is not harmful to and does not contradict Russian interests."" NATO ambitions . His coalition shares the outgoing government's ambitions to join the NATO alliance, he said. Russia and Georgia would also need to work together in the future to resolve the issue of separatist territories, Ivanishvili said. ""The Caucasus is a very complex and explosive region. I think, here, we will find common interests in the future,"" he said. In a statement released by his office, Saakashvili said he would assist the transition to a new government and that his party, the United National Movement, would now assume the role of the main opposition. ""It is well known to you that for us, and for me personally, the ideas of the coalition are fundamentally unacceptable. There are very deep differences between us, and we think that they are extremely wrong,"" he said. ""However, democracy works so that the Georgian people make decisions by majority and this is what we hugely respect."" Saakashvili paid tribute to the country's achievements over the past eight years, citing progress in fighting crime and corruption as well as in building new institutions, and said his party would fight in opposition to protect those advances. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the results indicate the people of Georgia want change. ""If these results become a reality, then the Georgian political landscape will be more diverse,"" he said. ""It should be welcome because it probably means that more responsible and constructive forces are entering the parliament."" CNN iReporter Andro Kiknadze, 31, shot video of jubilant opposition voters waving flags and honking car horns near Freedom Square in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. He said he had voted for Saakashvili because he thought the president stabilized the country. ""Many things have changed since he came to power,"" Kiknadze said. ""We are more stable and peaceful than before."" The United States hailed the election as a ""significant step in the consolidation of Georgian democracy."" ""Georgian citizens have set a regional and global example by conducting a competitive campaign, freely exercising their democratic rights, and affirming their commitment to undertake a peaceful transfer of power,"" the White House said in a statement, adding that much work remains in coming days and months. The vote in the parliamentary election had not been fully tallied, with Georgia's Central Electoral Commission continuing to count. The commission's performance has been lauded as professional and independent, said Lorne Craner, president of the International Republican Institute, a democracy support organization funded by the U.S. Congress. ""There's no question in my mind ... the election commission can be relied upon,"" he said from Tbilisi. iReporter Jonathan Hackett, an American teacher living in the Imereti region in central Georgia, said the scene was calm Monday night and Tuesday morning, despite the large amount of support for Saakashvili in the region. ""It turns out the election was considered free and fair, at least in our little village,"" he said. ""People were gathered outside the local convenience store discussing the outcome."" Power shift to prime minister . The new system will shift power from the president to the new prime minister, according to Thomas de Waal, an expert on Georgia and a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ""The prime minister will be chosen by parliament, which thus hands important powers to whichever political force obtains a majority in parliament in the ... elections,"" de Waal said. Until recently, Saakashvili and the United National Movement have controlled much of the political life in this country of 4.5 million people. Saakashvili has been praised by U.S. and European officials for making progress in the fight against corruption and for continuing economic reform. But critics, who coalesced behind Ivanishvili, said reform was only skin deep, and charged that Saakashvili has been pulling all the levers of Soviet-style ""administrative measures."" During the election campaign, they raised concerns about a level playing field for the opposition, alleging harassment and limitations over access to the media. Money was also a major issue during the campaign, experts said. Observers: Georgia opposition may be premature in declaring victory . For example, the government tried to regulate how much could be spent on corporate contributions and that affected how much Ivanishvili could spend. ""I think that the government, at times, overstepped when it created an entity called the Chamber of Control and Fines to watch over these new regulations,"" said Stephen Nix, the director of Eurasia at the International Republican Institute and an expert on Georgia. ""This means, overall, that there is a closer approach to democracy which will be felt about one year from now, in October 2013, when a presidential election happens,"" Nix added, speaking from Tbilisi. High stakes in polarized election . For his part, Saakashvili has referred to the opposition leader Ivanishvili as that ""big money guy."" The president accused Ivanishvili of wanting to ""buy the whole system,"" and said he saw behind him the hand of Russia. The president said he was concerned by the amount of wealth that Ivanishvili has accrued in Russia, and whether that money was used to influence the elections. ""We know what Russian money is all about,"" he said. ""How it was made, what kind of methods were used, and certainly it is a source of concern,"" he said. False stereotypes, Ivanishvili says . A self-made businessman who made his money in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union, Ivanishvili left Russia shortly after Vladimir Putin came to power. His staff confirms his status as Georgia's richest man, with a fortune estimated at approximately $6.4 billion, equal to almost half of Georgia's economic output. But he said ""it's not money and wealth which is my capital. It's trust from the people toward me. Money has nothing to do with this."" The billionaire said he had sold all his Russian assets, and defended his reputation. But Saakashvili insisted that not only Ivanishvili but Putin himself was trying to undermine Georgia. ""Vladimir Putin said clearly that he is interested in the Georgian election outcome. He clearly said that he wanted the Georgian government out. He clearly said that he wanted me to be physically destroyed, he said it publicly,"" Saakashvili said. Georgia's electoral waters were roiled by a shocking video that emerged last month showing abuse in a Georgian prison, including one male prisoner being sexually assaulted. The opposition claimed the video was proof of a repressive system put in place by Saakashvili and his government. Former Georgian prison guard: I witnessed abuse for years . Saakashvili said his government had responded quickly and decisively to the video, citing an investigation that has led to arrests. ""Not only were the immediate perpetrators arrested,"" he said, ""but two government ministers resigned because they shared political responsibility for allowing the system to fail."" Read more: Georgia interior minister quits over prisoner abuse videos . The torture shown on the video is no accident, but part of a system that is shameful, Ivanishvili said. De Waal said the video is significant, as the prison population has quadrupled over the past eight or nine years. ""I do think it (the video) supports the opposition narrative that the government is arrogant and unaccountable. And this is obviously a war of two narratives over Georgia that we're seeing in this election,"" he said.","""Restoring relations with the Kremlin is one of our main tasks,"" Ivanishvili says .

"(CNN) -- Their CVs combined look like the envy of all bona fide air adventurers. Pioneering ultralight aircraft? Been there. Setting world records by circling the globe nonstop in a balloon? Done that. Commanding the first ever 24-hour flight on a plane powered just by the sun? Yep, you've guessed it. And now, following 12 years of complex designs and intense training, aviation pioneers Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg are set to conquer new heights, taking up the challenge of the first solar flight around the globe. The Swiss duo unveiled last week Solar Impulse 2, a revolutionary aircraft designed to achieve the longest ever flight in the history of aviation in terms of duration for a single pilot. It will attempt to fly non-stop for 120 hours (yes, that's five successive days and nights) over oceans and continents without a drop of fuel. Made of carbon fiber, Solar Impulse 2 is the evolution of a prototype that has smashed several aviation records in recent years, including the first fully solar-powered overnight flight lasting 26 hours in 2010. The upgraded plane has a huge wingspan of 72 meters, wider than a standard Boeing 747, and weighs only 2,300 kilos -- that's about as heavy as a family car. Its wings are covered with a skin of 17,000 solar cells that supply four electric motors with renewable energy, while its custom-made lithium batteries are able to store enough solar energy throughout the day to keep the ultralight plane flying at night. ""What we have now is the first airplane in the world which has unlimited endurance,"" says 62-year-old Borschberg, a father of three, who was the one in the cockpit in 2010's record-breaking flight. ""It can fly a day and a night, it can fly a week, it can fly a month -- theoretically it can fly a year,"" he adds. ""It's the most energy efficient airplane ever built."" 20-minute sleeping . Inside the airplane's tiny cockpit, measuring about one and a half the interior volume of a 2013 Mini Cooper, every detail has been calculated to achieve maximum energy efficiency while ensuring the pilot can live there for several days. Its structure is surrounded by a high-density foam to protect the pilot from temperatures ranging from -40Â°C +40Â°C in the absence of heating and air conditioning. There is enough space for food, water and oxygen supplies, while a multipurpose seat, which comes packed with a parachute and a life-raft, functions as a toilet. It also reclines to allow the captain to perform physical exercises to keep blood circulation going as well as take a nap -- but only for up to 20 minutes. ""We've learned to do what we call polyphasic sleep,"" says Borschberg, referring to the practice of sleeping several times over a day. ""You need to know how to rest, how to eat, when to go to the toilet and how to keep the body functioning. Of course, we've also prepared for the worst -- how to jump out if it's necessary, how to survive in the ocean with a small life raft and how to get rescued."" To achieve all that, Piccard and Borschberg have spent countless days and nights inside flight simulators over the last few years. But while technical training is crucial, Piccard says preparing yourself mentally is as important. ""You have to be ready in your head to really visualize all the solutions,"" says Piccard. ""All the positive emotions around the flight that will last five to six days alone over the ocean, and also visualize how to enjoy it -- otherwise it's very, very difficult."" It runs in the family . If there's someone who knows about difficult, if not impossible, undertakings, then that's Piccard, a third-generation adventurer. His grandfather was the first man to make it to the stratosphere in a balloon while his father was the first to reach the deepest point of the Earth's oceans, the Mariana Trench at nearly 11,000 meters. Following in their footsteps, Piccard developed a passion for aviation early on. Starting out as a teenager, he soon became one of the pioneers of ultralight flying and won several hang-glider aerobatics competitions. In March 1999, he completed the first non-stop round-the-world balloon flight with Brian Jones from the UK, while four years later he joined forces with Borschberg, an aviator, entrepreneur and mechanical engineer, to embark on their lofty mission to build a solar aircraft that could circle the world with no polluting emissions. ""In my family tradition there has always been the scientific exploration and the protection of the environment -- so this is what drives me,"" says 56-year-old Piccard, who is also a doctor, psychiatrist, and a father of three. ""(To) have an interesting and exciting life but also have a useful life for others,"" he adds. Indeed, more than just setting new records, it's this desire to chart a sustainable path for future generations that seems to motivate the Solar Impulse founders -- when asked whether he was at all afraid of undertaking once again something that's never been done before , Piccard is unequivocal. ""To be really honest,"" he says decisively, ""I am very afraid of living in a world that burns one million tons of oil every hour -- without even counting gas and coal; a world that is destroying the planet and the environment,"" he continues. ""I am much less afraid to fly in a solar-powered airplane because solar power is one of the solutions for the future. A future without fuel . Following last week's unveiling, Piccard and Borschberg are now set to begin test flights in mid-May before embarking on their 35,000-kilometer journey in March 2015. Starting from the Gulf region in the Middle East, the two pilots will then fly over India, Myanmar and China, cross the Pacific, the United States and the Atlantic with the aim of returning to their departure point. With a sluggish top speed of just 88 miles per hour, each ocean crossing will last five to six days, taking the total flight time up to 20-25 days over the course of a few months. ""Because it's a single pilot and the plane flies slowly, we're going to land on every continent and switch the pilot,"" explains Piccard. ""So one of us will make the Pacific, one will make the Atlantic; one will cross China the other one will cross America and so on."" Each stop on their itinerary will last for several days as the Solar Impulse team wants to organize public events to raise awareness about a more sustainable way of life. ""This is really the message we want to spread,"" says Piccard. ""With clean technology, with renewable energy we can achieve incredible things without any fuel at all.""

"To Hillary Clinton, U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu is the fighter for Louisiana who ""refused to let Washington turn its back"" on the state in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina almost 10 years ago. Clinton reached back to the months and years after the 2005 hurricane killed more than 1,500 people in Louisiana to praise Landrieu on Saturday at a New Orleans rally for the endangered three-term senator. ""She was relentless,"" Clinton said, noting that she and Landrieu were in the Senate at the time. ""You learn a lot about a person and a leader in a moment like that. And I saw Mary in action, no cameras, no attention, just focused like a laser to take care of her people."" Clinton continued: ""She never gave up. If you know anything about Mary Landrieu, you know that is an ingrained characteristic, she doesn't shy away from a fight."" Landrieu is in a different kind of fight this year -- a fight to keep her Senate seat against a stout challenge from Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy. Every national poll since the start of September has shown Cassidy besting the incumbent. Clinton did her part on Saturday to knock Cassidy but never actually referred to him by name. ""From what I have heard, Mary's opponent didn't really lift a finger after Isaac,"" Clinton said, using a familiar Landrieu campaign attack that cites a 2012 no-vote against legislation that included disaster relief money for the state after Hurricane Isaac rocked the state. Clinton also subtly hit George W. Bush's presidency for fumbling the response to Katrina, blaming the former president for a ""paralyzed"" response to the tragedy. For her part, Landrieu portrayed herself as the right choice for Louisiana because her support for oil and gas, women and seniors. She also didn't run away from her 18-years in the Senate, despite polls that show a deep-seeded resentment of Congress and an anti-incumbent mood throughout the country. ""I have now worked with three presidents, four majority leaders and six governors,"" Landrieu said within the first few minutes of her speech. ""And I know how to get work done for you, no matter what the line up in Washington is and no matter how gridlocked it might be."" Landrieu, however, finds herself behind in her fourth race. Cassidy has sought to tie Landrieu to President Barack Obama, who in much of Louisiana is markedly unpopular. In nearly every ad, Cassidy mention that ""Landrieu supports Barack Obama 97 percent of the time."" The attacks have worked and some polls show the Democratic senator might be past the point of Clinton's saving. Landrieu advisers and spokesmen on Saturday told reporters to disregard most of the polling and instead pointed to early voting totals as proof that momentum is swinging their way. In particular, Matthew Lehner, a senior adviser to Landrieu, pointed to the fact that 33% of early ballots totals have come from black voters, a strong demographic for the Democrat. ""Sen. Landrieu has had tight races in all of her races,"" said Fabien Levy, the campaign's spokesman. ""If need be, we will be ready [for a runoff]. But we are ready to win this on election night.""","Hillary Clinton reached back to Hurricane Katrina to herald Mary Landrieu on Saturday .

"The last Paris Motor Show was marked by tear gas and workers' violent protests against job cuts. Now, the mood is different and industry bosses are back doing what they prefer: Showing off the latest luxury models, supercars and hybrid motors. Among the most anticipated cars at this week's event -- one of the biggest dates in the car enthusiast's diary -- will be a plug-in hybrid Lamborghini, Ferrari 458 Speciale, Mercedes AMG GT, and a five-door MINI. Manufacturers will unveil around 100 new models and designs, three times more than at the last show two years ago. Europe, while still fragile, has shaken off the financial crisis and the auto industry has seen a 6% boost in car sales so far this year, to 8.3 million. It's the largest increase since the crisis began in 2007. Recovery faces hurdles . European sales were badly damaged by the recession, as people who already owned a vehicle put off buying a new one to cut their spending. New car registrations plummeted throughout Europe, with its most troubled economies facing the biggest drops: Registrations declined 80% in Greece, 57% in Spain and 53% in Portugal. But as sales have picked up, geopolitical pressures have put the industry under renewed strain. The West's trade war with Russia has had a significant knock-on effect, and sales are expected to slow in the year's final months. Before the Ukraine crisis, Russia was tracking to become Europe's largest car market, expected to surpass the UK and Germany by 2016. Instead, analysts expect that sales this year will decline between 8% and 12% this year. Latest monthly figures, from the Association of European Businesses, show sales in Russia plummeted 25.8% in August compared to last year. Efficiency first . While recent gains have lent an upbeat atmosphere to this year's show, long-terms trends make for miserable reading. Car sales in Europe are nearly one fifth below the peak of late 2000s, and manufacturers are being forced to look for new growth areas. More efficient, hybrid and electric cars are seen as central to growth and a ""technology race"" is underway between European brands, according to Felix Kuhnert, PWC's head of European automotive industry division. New, ""greener"" hybrid models are expected to be among the show's most coveted creations. Lamborghini is unveiling its first ever plug-in hybrid supercar, the 910 horsepower Asterion, which boasts a V10 engine and three electric motors. Japanese luxury brand Infiniti will reveal plans for its flagship sedan, the hybrid Infiniti Q80. Jaguar will premier its XE, the most fuel-efficient of its stable to date. And Porsche is bringing a new plug-in hybrid version of its premium SUV Cayenne. European manufacturers are plunging money into research and development initiatives towards alternative drivetrains, lightweight construction, and other efficiency technologies, as they bid to attract new customers, Kuhner said. According to Kuhnert, the ""old and inefficient"" cars clogging up Europe's highways will be replaced ""as soon as the economic outlook in each country becomes more positive."" Focus on Asia . Industry focus has also turned to Asia, as the middle classes boom and spending power increases. China is proving an attractive market for car manufacturers, despite concerns around the introduction of quotas and restrictions on new car registrations to combat pollution. The numbers are impressive: BMW sales in China were up 23% in the first half of 2014, pushing the group's sales in the period to 1 million. But the growth in Asia will not be driven by China alone.  Sales in Indonesia and Thailand are increasing with Indonesia's new car sales doubling between 2007 and 2012 and staying strong since. Many car makers have also moved parts of their production to Asia, in a bid to cut costs by producing where they sell.","Paris Motor Show kicks off as car giants take the stage to present new models .

"What can happen in a country while the president is gone for more than two months? A lot. Just ask Venezuelans. Until his return to Caracas on Monday, President Hugo Chavez hadn't been seen in public or on national television since he went to Cuba for cancer surgery in December. Allies maintained that he was running his country from Havana, while critics said the country was in limbo without its leader. But Chavez's lengthy absence from Venezuela didn't stop his government from making some significant changes. The latest one -- devaluing the country's currency -- starts Wednesday. It's a significant move that stands to affect global businesses and everyday Venezuelans. Here are some key events that have unfolded in Venezuela while Chavez was gone: . Currency devaluation . Long lines of customers packed Venezuelan electronics and appliance stores after Friday's announcement of plans to devalue the country's currency by nearly a third. ""We are following instructions from President Hugo Chavez, who demanded more efficiency in the fight against inflation,"" Finance Minister Jorge Giordani told reporters when he made the announcement Friday, holding up a decree that he said came from Chavez. ""Here is the president's signature, in case you would like to recognize it or if you still have doubts."" The new exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars to 1 dollar goes into effect Wednesday. It's the fifth time the Venezuelan government has devalued its currency in the past decade. Gallery: Caracas among world's most expensive cities . Venezuelans fearing the move would mean a sharp spike in the cost of imported goods have rushed to stores in recent days. The country's opposition has criticized the measure, accusing the government of mismanaging finances. And international businesses have said they expect to take a hit as a result of the currency changes. Colgate-Palmolive said in a statement Monday that it expects a one-time loss of $120 million this quarter. Prison violence . Clashes at Venezuela's Uribana prison left at least 58 people dead last month. The fighting, which authorities said occurred during an operation to disarm inmates at the facility, drew sharp criticism from human rights organizations. ""This clearly demonstrates -- yet again -- that the Venezuelan prison system is in crisis and that it has reached extremely alarming levels,"" Amnesty International said in a statement, calling for an investigation into the incident and more widespread problems of prison overcrowding and violence. Opposition politicians pushed for the resignation of Venezuela's prison minister, Iris Varela, after the clashes, while lawmakers from Chavez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela praised her work cleaning up Venezuela's prison system. The government has said it is investigating the Uribana incident. Cabinet change . Standing in for Chavez at the annual state of the union ceremony in January, Vice President Nicolas Maduro announced a high-level appointment in Chavez's name. Maduro told lawmakers that Chavez had tapped Elias Jaua to be Venezuela's new foreign minister. Opposition politicians questioned whether Chavez had actually nominated a new foreign minister or whether Maduro had effectively taken over the presidency. Government officials maintained that Chavez was in charge. Jaua, long a close ally of Chavez, had been Venezuela's vice president until he stepped down to run for a state governor post last year. In his role as foreign minister, Jaua traveled to China this month and met with government leaders there. Speaking on state television last week, Jaua said he had a ""nice meeting"" Thursday with Chavez in Havana. Loyalty oath, but no inauguration . Health problems prevented Chavez from coming to Caracas for an inauguration ceremony on January 10. While political opponents said that postponing the inauguration was unconstitutional, Venezuela's Supreme Court sided with Chavez's party, which had argued that the president did not need to be present at his swearing-in for his next term to begin. Instead of a traditional inauguration ceremony, throngs of supporters in Caracas swore an oath of loyalty in Chavez's absence. Many waved flags and carried photos of the ailing president. Chavez health updates . Regarding his two-plus months of treatment in Cuba, government officials say Venezuelans have sent a clear message: take the time you need. After weeks of grim assessments describing the president as battling a serious infection and fighting for his life, government statements about Chavez's health took a more optimistic tone in recent weeks, culminating with his return to Caracas early Monday morning. ""We come back to the country of Venezuela,"" Chavez posted on his official Twitter account. ""Thank God! Thank you dear people! Here we continue the treatment."" Last week Maduro said Chavez was ""in battle"" and undergoing ""extremely complex and hard"" treatments, but he did not detail what the treatments involved. Government ministers have repeatedly said in recent weeks that the president's condition is improving. Chavez has been battling cancer since June 2011, but officials have never revealed what type of cancer he has, and speculation has swirled about his health and political future. Venezuela's opposition has criticized the government's lack of transparency, while the government has accused political opponents and the media of spreading rumors about the president's health. Vice president plays a prominent role . Meanwhile, on the Venezuelan political stage, Maduro has been front and center during El Comandante's absence. Maduro has spoken at political rallies around the country and delivered updates about Chavez on national television. Last month, he told throngs of supporters that opponents were plotting to murder him. Opposition critics have said he's campaigning for office -- a claim the government has denied. Maduro and other government officials have accused the opposition of printing fake campaign posters with Maduro's picture. Before he left for Cuba for surgery last month, Chavez said he wanted Maduro to assume the presidency if he became incapacitated and called on voters to support Maduro at the polls.","Chavez returned Monday at 2:30 a.m. local time, vice president says .

"A U.S. drone Wednesday fired on an area in northwestern Pakistan, according to two Pakistani intelligence sources and a witness. Details about what the drone hit and whether there were any casualties weren't immediately available. Northwestern Pakistan is home to loosely governed tribal areas near the border with Afghanistan, and the area is a base for foreign fighters and a place of refuge for members of the Islamist militant Haqqani movement. The drone strike comes just days after two brazen attacks on or near Pakistan's largest airport in the southern Pakistani port city of Karachi. Earlier Wednesday, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan claimed that it carried out one of the attacks -- the weekend airport assault that resulted in an hours-long siege and left 36 people dead, including the assailants. The claim was made in an e-mail that included pictures that the militant group said were of the 10 attackers. The militants said the attack was carried out with the Pakistani Taliban, which has confirmed that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan conducted the Karachi airport attack, Pakistani Taliban commander Abdullah Bahar Mehsud told CNN in a phone conversation. Mehsud said the pictures in the e-mail claiming responsibility were indeed photos of the 10 attackers. He said the Pakistani Taliban helped coordinate and provided material support in the attack. Late Sunday night, 10 militants stormed the airport's cargo area in a siege that left dozens dead. The Pakistani Taliban also claimed responsibility for that assault, saying the attack was retaliation for the death of former chief Hakimullah Mehsud, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in November in North Waziristan. The Uzbek militants have not claimed responsibility for a second attack Tuesday on airport security forces that forced the airport, Pakistan's largest and busiest, to shut down. Tuesday's assault targeted the Airport Security Forces academy near Karachi's Jinnah International Airport, the airport's manager told CNN's Saima Mohsin in Karachi. Security forces told CNN that an unknown number of gunmen attacked the academy's entrance and were met with an armed response. The attackers fled, and no one was killed in the attack, officials said. Once again, the Pakistani Taliban, which is formally known as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP,  claimed responsibility. ""This wave of attacks will be continuing in retaliation for the shelling and atrocities of the government,"" spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said by phone Tuesday from an undisclosed location. Shahid said earlier this week that the Pakistani Taliban would engage ""in a full-out war with the Pakistani state, starting on June 10."" But the airport itself was safe Tuesday, Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority said. ""#Jinnah Airport is safe, #ASF academy is under attack,"" the aviation authority tweeted Tuesday. The Civil Aviation Authority said flights were temporarily suspended but later resumed Tuesday. By Tuesday afternoon, the situation was ""under control,"" military spokesman Asim Bajwa said. ""3 to 4 terrorists fired near ASF Camp, ran away,"" Bajwa tweeted. ""No breach of fence, no Entry. Chase is on, situation under control."" What the Karachi airport attack says about the Pakistani Taliban . Airstrikes killed 15 militants . Hours before the renewed violence in Karachi, the Pakistani military launched a deadly assault targeting nine militant hideouts Tuesday. At least 15 militants were killed in the airstrikes on Khyber Agency, in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, the Pakistani military said. A military spokesman said he could not confirm whether the airstrikes were directly related or in response to the airport violence this week. But it's those kinds of strikes that the Pakistani Taliban warned would spur more violence from their end. When the TTP claimed responsibility for Sunday's airport attack, it called on the government to end airstrikes -- or face more attacks like the Karachi airport terror attack. Apparently, the TTP followed through with its promise. History of terror . The Pakistani Taliban has long conducted an insurgency against the Pakistani government. ""Their primary target is the Pakistani state and its military,"" said Raza Rumi of the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani think tank. ""It resents the fact that (Pakistan) has an alliance with the West, and it wants Sharia to be imposed in Pakistan."" The U.S. Justice Department charged former TTP chief Hakimullah Mehsud in 2010 for his alleged involvement in a 2009 bombing at the United States' Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan. The attack killed seven U.S. citizens, including five CIA officers and a member of Jordanian intelligence. Hakimullah Mehsud took over from Baitullah Mehsud, a fellow clan member, in 2009 after the latter was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Four years later, Hakimullah Mehsud suffered the same fate.","Drone fires on area in northwestern Pakistan, sources say .

"A video that shows the beheading of American Steven Sotloff was delivered as a ""second message to America"" to halt airstrikes in Iraq, following through on a threat to kill the journalist. In the video posted Tuesday online, Sotloff says -- in a message surely scripted by his captors --  that he is ""paying the price"" for U.S. military intervention. The intelligence community in the United States is working to confirm the authenticity of the video, and the journalist's family was waiting for that formal authentication that Sotloff has been killed. ""The family knows of the video and is grieving privately,"" family spokesman Barak Barfi said. Who is ISIS? The killing of Sotloff follows a threat last month by ISIS made during the videotaped beheading of American journalist James Foley. The latest video threatens the life of another man. A masked ISIS figure in the new video speaks to U.S. President Barack Obama, telling him, ""Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."" The Islamic State has thrived and mutated during the civil war in Syria. It swept into Iraq in June, seizing large swaths of the country's Sunni-dominated northern and western provinces. Obama ordered targeted airstrikes in Iraq to begin in early August after ISIS fighters began targeting ethnic Yazidis and launching attacks toward the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil. ISIS appeared to date the execution video of Sotloff, referencing specific U.S. military actions in recent days, including U.S. airstrikes that helped over the weekend to break the siege of Amerli -- a northern Iraqi town home to thousands of minority Shiite Turkmen. Intelligence officials are analyzing the video, trying to answer some key questions, a senior U.S. administration official said. Among the questions, the official said: When was it shot? Where was it shot? Is the killer in the Sotloff video the same one in the Foley video? Until they answer those questions, the official said the administration does not want to speculate. It's believed ISIS is still holding a ""small number"" of Americans hostage, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors . ISIS: 'Back off and leave our people alone' In the new video, the militant threatens the life of the man, who is shown kneeling with the militant standing behind him. ""We take this opportunity to warn those governments who've entered this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone,"" the militant says. CNN could not immediately confirm when he was taken captive. But the Washington Post reported he was an aid worker abducted in March 2013. The newspaper, citing unnamed aid workers involved in efforts to gain his release, said he was abducted near a refugee camp in the northern Syrian province of Idlib. British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters he was aware of reports about the video and called Sotloff's killing ""an absolutely disgusting and despicable act."" Who was Sotloff? Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013, but his family kept the news secret, fearing harm to him if they went public. Out of public view, the family and government agencies had been trying to gain his release for the past year. Last week, Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi not to kill her son. ""Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson,"" she said. ""He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak."" Her plea was met with taunting responses on social media by ISIS supporters. Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians including the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies including ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a ""stand-up philosopher from Miami."" He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and The Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey -- among other countries -- and eventually Syria. Editor Nancy Gibbs said the magazine's staff is ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the reports of his death. ""He gave his life so readers would have access to information from some of the most dangerous places in the world,"" she said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family."" Sotloff brings the number of journalists killed in Syria to at least 70, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. More than 80 have been kidnapped in Syria since the civil war began, with many going unpublicized, the group said. ""We condemn in the strongest terms possible the murder of journalist Steven Sotloff. He, like James Foley, went to Syria to tell a story. They were civilians, not representatives of any government. Their murders are war crimes and those who committed them must be brought to justice swiftly,"" CPJ said. Obama on ISIS -- No strategy yet . Response from the White House . White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the administration ""has obviously been watching very carefully since this threat against Mr. Sotloff's life was originally made a few weeks ago."" A top U.S. State Department official told CNN's Christiane Amanpour to ""stay tuned"" on U.S. plans to combat the organization. ""We are putting the features in place, developing a broad regional coalition, a broad international coalition, working to get a new Iraqi government stood up, working to get our plans in place. So stay tuned,"" said Brett McGurk, the deputy U.S. assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iraq. Obama, who was briefed on the videotaped execution of Sotloff, came under fire from Republicans and Democrats who called on the President to take stronger against ISIS, also known as ISIL. The criticism came a week after Obama said, ""We don't have a strategy yet"" to deal with ISIS in Syria. Obama said he has asked America's top defense officials to prepare ""a range of options."" ""Mr. President, if you can't come up with a strategy, at least tell us what the goal is regarding ISIL,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, said ISIS must be stopped. ""We must use every tool at our disposal, short of introducing ground forces in combat roles, to put an end to the threat they pose to our national security,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The human rights group Amnesty International is calling on the United Nations to impose an arms embargo on Israel and the Palestinians, saying both sides used weapons supplied from abroad to carry out attacks on civilians during their three-week conflict in Gaza. Palestinian children make coffee behind a bullet and rocket riddled wall in Rafah, Gaza, on January 24, 2009. The London-based group issued a 38-page report Sunday night that detailed ""evidence of war crimes and other serious violations of international law by all parties."" Israeli forces used white phosphorus and other weapons supplied by the United States, killing hundreds of civilians and destroying homes, the group said. The use of white phosphorus is restricted under international law. In the early days of the Gaza conflict, the Israel Defense Forces denied using the ordnance. But later, Israeli officials said only that any shells fired in Gaza were ""in accordance with international law."" Amnesty said its researchers found munitions fragments littering school playgrounds, hospitals and homes after the 22-day fighting in Gaza ended in January. Many of the munitions used by the Israeli army were American-made, and included bombs, white phosphorus remains and missiles seemingly launched from unmanned drones, Amnesty said. ""To a large extent, Israel's military offensive in Gaza was carried out with weapons, munitions and military equipment supplied by the U.S.A. and paid for with U.S. taxpayers' money,"" Malcolm Smart, Amnesty's Middle East director, said in the report. He called on the United States to immediately suspend military aid to Israel. The United States is to provide $30 billion in military aid to Israel under a 10-year agreement that runs till 2017 -- a 25-percent increase compared with the period preceding the Bush administration, Amnesty said. The group also took to task Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007. It said it found remains of Qassam and Grad rockets fired by Palestinian armed groups in civilian areas. Grad rockets have a longer range than the crude, home-made Qassams. Israel said Palestinian militants have fired about 10,000 rockets and mortars into Israel in the past eight years. ""These unsophisticated weapons are either smuggled into Gaza clandestinely or constructed there from components secretly brought in from abroad,"" Amnesty said. Israel's foreign ministry responded harshly to the report, calling it biased and ""dedicated almost exclusively to the censure of Israel."" The ministry said the report does not mention Hamas' ""deliberate use"" of civilians as human shields. It also said Israel's use of weapons complied with international law and denied that its forces targeted civilians. ""The comparison of the supply of weapons to Israel and the Hamas in inappropriate,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Israel is a sovereign nation that is obligated to use force to protect its citizens, while Hamas is a terror organization."" Israel launched the attack on Hamas in Gaza on December 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern Israel. More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, were killed in the fighting. Since the two sides declared a cease-fire on January 21, militants have sporadically fired rockets into Israel. Israel has responded with airstrikes.","Amnesty International calls for U.N. arms embargo on Israel and Palestinians .

"(CNN) -- The aircraft that Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger heroically landed in New York's Hudson River began its long ride Saturday to an aviation museum in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Airbus A320, sans its wings and tail section, left a warehouse in Harrison, New Jersey, for the journey south, according to Shawn Dorsch, president of the Carolinas Aviation Museum. ""It's very hard to miss,"" Dorsch said of the fuselage. ""It's not covered."" The museum has invited the 155 crew members and passengers from the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" incident for a June 11 arrival reception, at which Sullenberger is the scheduled keynote speaker, Dorsch told CNN. On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 left LaGuardia Airport and ran into a flock of geese that damaged both engines, forcing the crew to make an emergency landing in the frigid Hudson. Rescuers quickly reached the aircraft and found passengers standing on its wings. Everyone was rescued. Sullenbeger, who retired in March 2010, and other crew members became instant celebrities. J. Supor & Son Trucking and Rigging Co. in New Jersey has donated the considerable cost of transporting the aircraft, Dorsch said. About 40 vehicles are in the entourage, which reached Rutgers University later Saturday. Because the rig's height won't allow the plane to go under older interstate bridges, some of the move will be on other highways, where wires and some stoplights will have to be temporarily moved, Dorsch said. The plane will be shown off at the Charlotte museum's main hangar. ""It will be on display almost as soon as it arrives,"" Dorsch said. US Airways and Airbus mechanics will reassemble the aircraft, including its wings and tail section. Much of that work will be completed by the fall. Sullenberger's uniform, passenger belongings and other artifacts will be part of the display, he said. The cabin will look much as it did during the flight, Dorsch added. Between 30,000 and 35,000 visitors visit the museum annually. Dorsch expects that number will triple within 18 months of the exhibit's opening. Most of the flight's passengers still live in the Charlotte area, he added. The incident represents the height of technical achievements in safety and human heroism, the museum president said. Dorsch recalled taking the next flight after Flight 1549 and seeing the plane in the Hudson River. ""I was thinking, 'That could have been me,'"" he said.","US Airways plane will have new home at North Carolina museum .

"Iraqis reacted with outrage Wednesday to news of a plea deal for a U.S. Marine squad leader charged in connection with the deaths of 24 people, in which he received a rank reduction and pay cut but avoided jail time. The November 2005 killings in Haditha, Iraq, constituted one of the worst attacks on civilians by U.S. troops during the Iraq war. The deaths enraged Iraqis, put a spotlight on the conduct of the U.S. military and was compared to Vietnam's My Lai massacre by one congressman. On Tuesday, Staff Sgt. Frank G. Wuterich was sentenced to a maximum of 90 days in prison, but avoided any time in the brig because of a plea deal. The military judge was obligated to abide by the arrangement between prosecutors and defense attorneys, which amounts to a reduction in rank -- to private -- and a pay cut. ""This court is unjust and its decision was unfair for Iraqi people,"" Shaeed Fakhri, a lecturer at Babel University in Hilla, said Wednesday as he visited Baghdad. ""This soldier should be executed. The verdict is unfair and unjust for the innocent people who were killed in this incident."" ""This is very sad and very painful,"" said Hashim Khader, a store owner in Baghdad. ""They were just civilian people who did not raise weapons against the occupiers and they were killed this way. This is a heinous crime and the soldiers should get the most severe punishment."" Wuterich, 31, of Meriden, Connecticut, originally faced 152 years in prison on nine counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon and three counts of dereliction of duty in the Haditha incident. He wound up pleading guilty to one count of negligent dereliction of duty. Charges against six other Marines charged in the case were dropped, and another was acquitted. Wuterich's sentence was a ""big disappointment,"" Taleb al-Essawi, political adviser to the governor of Iraq's Anbar province, said Tuesday. ""I can't believe that the court decided to drop all the charges except one charge. ... This is a joke, because according to the Iraqi law, all those soldiers should be executed. We demand from the American administration to reconsider the court decision."" Al-Essawi also said the U.S. government should compensate the victims' families. ""Why is American blood so precious while the Iraqi blood is so cheap?"" Hanaa Mohammed, an employee with Iraq's Ministry of Planning, said Wednesday. ""This is unacceptable. ... The Iraqi government should take a strong position and protest the court's verdict right now."" ""We have been following this case since 2006 and we were hoping that those soldiers, who killed 24 innocent people, will receive fair punishment,"" Khalid Salman, head of the Haditha local council, told CNN Tuesday. ""But now we are convinced that the judicial system in America is unjust,"" he said. ""This is not the end, and we will continue pursuing those soldiers legally through the international courts."" ""The Iraqi government should appoint lawyers and send them to the international courts because these courts have a fair and neutral judicial system, unlike the American judicial system,"" Khader said Wednesday. An expert on U.S. military law said a public explanation is needed regarding the case's resolution. ""The trial counsel and convening authority has a duty to explain this pretrial agreement in order to safeguard public confidence in the administration of justice,"" said Eugene R. Fidell, senior research scholar and a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School. Under the military justice system, he said, the ""convening authority,"" a unit commander, makes the central decision. ""The prosecution and staff judge advocate play an advisory role,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, it's the commander's decision to accept or reject a proposed pretrial agreement."" About the investigation into the so-called Haditha massacre, Fidell said: ""It does seem that a set of cases that began with some pretty terrible allegations has basically fizzled. The public ought to have confidence in the administration of justice."" The plea agreement was ""unjust,"" according to Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman, as the Marines ""committed mass killings in Haditha."" ""We ask the human rights organizations and (nongovernmental organizations) in America and all over the world to strongly condemn this verdict. Iraqi blood isn't so cheap,"" Othman said in a Facebook posting Tuesday. A Marine spokesman said a final adjudication will be made on the case by Lt. Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, commander of Marine Corps Forces Central Command, but while he can reduce the sentence, he cannot increase it. Facing the judge in a Marine base courtroom Tuesday, Wuterich, a divorced father of three young daughters, expressed no emotion. Earlier in the day, he told the judge: ""For six years, I have had to accept that my name will always be associated with a massacre, being a cold-blooded baby killer, an 'out of control' monster, and a conspiring liar. There's nothing I can do about whoever believes these things."" According to previous testimony and court records, Wuterich, who was assigned to 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, was the squad leader on November 19, 2005, when members of his patrol unit were moving a supply convoy through Haditha, an insurgent stronghold where armed resistance fighters hid among the civilian population. An improvised explosive device exploded under a vehicle, killing Lance Cpl. Miguel Terrazas, 20, and injuring two other Marines. During the more than two-week trial that ended with the plea deal, prosecutors argued Wuterich lost control after seeing the body of his friend blown apart by the bomb and led his men on a angry rampage, ordering his squad to ""shoot first and ask questions later."" Wuterich's team stormed two nearby homes, blasting their way in with grenades and M-16 rifle fire. Among the dead was an elderly man in a wheelchair. When the 45-minute incident was over, 24 men, women and children were dead. Wuterich was accused of ordering his men to storm the homes, part of what his attorney has said was a search for those believed responsible for planting the bomb and, later, shooting at the men. The prosecution contended the Marines were out for revenge. The case didn't come to light until January 2006, when Time magazine broke the story. Two months later, the military launched an investigation. Wuterich said Tuesday that he never fired his weapon at any women or children. ""When I told my team to shoot first and ask questions later, the intent wasn't that they would shoot civilians, it was that they would not hesitate in the face of the enemy,"" he said. To the victims' families, he said, ""Words cannot express my sorrow for the loss of your loved ones."" ""Many of the Marines who were there that day, along with everyone who has stood by me and supported me, may be disappointed that I pled guilty,"" Wuterich said. ""It might suggest that I believe we behaved badly or dishonorably. The truth is, I don't believe anyone in my squad, nor any member of Kilo Co., 3/1 behaved in any way that was dishonorable or contrary to the highest ideals that we all live by as Marines."" The incident provoked the condemnation of the late Rep. John Murtha, D-Pennsylvania, who compared it to the 1968 My Lai massacre, and then-President George W. Bush, who vowed that if an investigation showed Marines killed unarmed civilians, ""there will be a punishment.""","""This soldier should be executed,"" one Iraqi man says .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Propped up by strangers, a woman wails outside Nairobi's main city morgue, unable to control her grief. She enters the brown makeshift counseling tent -- but her screams still echo outside. At the same time, dozens of families linger and wait, not sure whether their loved ones are dead or alive. Janet Mwikali cradled her granddaughter as she longed for any word on Monday. Her husband John worked inside the mall's Nakumatt grocery store and was among the missing. ""I have hope, and I pray,"" she said. ""He's the love of my life."" It's a scene that's played out many times since Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Westgate Mall on Saturday. As many as 63 people are still unaccounted for, days after the siege began. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack . But the odds seem grim. At least 67 people are dead, and many more may be trapped in the rubble of the partially-collapsed building. The Kenyan government announced Tuesday the siege had ended, but no more corpses arrived at the main city morgue. So the agonizing wait continues. American teens among mall attackers, Kenya says . A time of mourning, remembrance for those who know . For those who know for certain their loved ones are gone, a long road to recovery begins. Mourners gathered Thursday to honor popular Radio Africa host Ruhila Adatia-Sood, who died while judging a children's cooking competition at the mall. Several children also were shot. Adatia-Sood was pregnant with her first child when she died. Adatia-Sood's relatives told CNN's David McKenzie in an emotional interview that the young mother-to-be was, as her sister Pinky Adatia Armaid described, ""the glue that held us together."" ""She was a media person. Everybody knew her. Everybody loved her and everybody -- if they knew she was going to be somewhere, they would come out to see her, just to see what she was like. She loved kids. Kids loved her."" ""She was the light in our family,"" said sister-in-law Komal Sood Blount. ""She has only been with a short time, but it feels like she was with us forever."" Ram Sharma, the priest for Adatia-Sood's husband's family, said that Adatia-Sood was ""so happy that she is receiving a baby."" ""Her tragic killing and the killing of her unborn child has (left) an irreparable hole in this tightly knit community."" As mourners gathered Thursday, relatives said they were overwhelmed by an outpouring of sympathy, support and personal loss from those who knew Adatia-Sood and from those who were among her many fans. ""We were really touched,"" said Pinky Adatia Arnaud. ""I've see all the communities coming together, no matter what their religion, their color. I just hope people will stick together whether Ruhila was here or not."" The dreaded outcome . For those left waiting and wondering outside the morgue, hope is the only consolation. They hope to never see their loved ones wheeled by. But they desperately want answers. A day after Mwikali clutched her granddaughter, praying for her husband's return, she found her husband's body at the morgue. She was too despondent to speak.

"(CNN) -- The youngest son of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was named vice chairman of the Workers Party of Korea's central military commission, North Korea's state news agency reported Tuesday. Kim Jong Un, who is widely expected to be the successor to North Korea's ""Dear Leader,"" was also named to the Central Committee of the party. Earlier, during the party conference, the younger Kim became a four-star general, according to the Korean Central News Agency. The Korean Workers' Party last convened its delegates more than four decades ago. Little is known about Kim Jong Un. Two photos of him consistently circulate in news reports outside of North Korea. That's because he's been kept off the radar by the North. ""They don't release the information, so no one can know,"" said Kang Cheol-hwan, a North Korea defector and activist. ""When he was little, he studied in Bern (Switzerland), in a school for the elite. He got an international education."" Before Kim's promotion to general on Monday, North Korea's state-run media didn't mention him: There were no family photos showing him as a youngster and no images of him by his father's side, learning to lead. He is Kim's third and youngest son. He's 27 or 28 years old. His grandfather, Kim Il Sung, ruled for nearly 50 years, and a mythic cult of personality was woven around him. His son, Kim Jong Il, took over after Kim Il Sung died of a heart attack in 1994. What is life like inside North Korea? Kim Il Sung called himself the ""Great Leader,"" and Kim Jong Il calls himself the ""Dear Leader."" Kim Jong Il served a 20-year apprenticeship at his father's side. But with Kim Jong Il, now 68, and in poor health after suffering a stroke, analysts think succession plans have accelerated. In January 2009, South Korean intelligence reportedly intercepted a message circulated around North Korean embassies globally, stating that Kim Jong Un was being prepared for succession. Since then, there has been no further confirmation from any North Korean official source. Opinion: Change in the wind? Recent foreign visitors to Pyongyang, however, say ordinary North Koreans know his name. Schoolchildren are being taught a song called ""Footsteps,"" praising Kim Jong Un, though not by name. ""North Korea is not a country where Kim Il Sung to Kim Jong Il or from Kim Jong Il to Kim Jong Un pass power from one person to another person. The succession goes from one power collective to another collective,"" said Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, South Korea. ""I see little possibility for clash domestically between different groups."" Vice guide to North Korea . One key question if Kim Jong Un does inherit leadership: Can he sustain his grandfather's and father's legacy, even as North Koreans go hungry while the country pours money into its nuclear program and military? Kim Jong Il prioritized the military and bypassed the party. He might now be preparing a more dovish course, given the catastrophic economic conditions his country faces after a decade and a half of military confrontation, said Suh Jae-jean, president of Seoul's Korea Institute of National Unification. Kim Jong Il introduced his ""Red Banner"" policy in 1996, a more militant tack than his father's blend of Stalinism and Korean self-reliance. North Korea has acknowledged producing roughly 40 kilograms of enriched plutonium -- enough for about seven nuclear bombs, according to the U.S. State Department. The U.N. Security Council last year condemned North Korea's launch of a long-range rocket, saying it violated a resolution banning ballistic missile testing. The North expelled U.S. nuclear experts and U.N. nuclear inspectors after the rebuke.","Kim Jong Un is named vice chairman of military commission .

"Misrata, Libya (CNN) -- Heavy fighting that began at dawn and continued past midnight Friday left at least 31 people dead Saturday in the western Libyan city of Misrata, where rebel forces thwarted efforts by government forces to enter from the west and south. By the end of Friday, more than 160 others had been wounded, said medical sources at the city's Hekmah Hospital. Friday's casualties were the heaviest in a month, Dr. Khaled Abu Falgha said. Medics chanted, ""The martyrs are beloved to God"" every time a patient died, he said. The rebels said Gadhafi's forces also shelled nearby Zlitan, as well as rebel positions in Dafniya. Tanks were rolling in and witnesses on the frontline said pro-Gadhafi forces were firing rockets and missiles. ""It is horrible out there,"" one rebel fighter said. ""The revolutionaries are taking tank power in their chests."" Misrata's oustkirts were under continuous bombardment Friday. At a field hospital set up on the western front, doctors were so busy they didn't count the dozens of patients they treated. Their efforts were focused largely on stabilizing the wounded so they could withstand the trip to the main hospital in the city center. There, rebel forces were firmly in control and the streets remained quiet throughout the day, except for loud, thunderous booms in the distance. By the end of the day, rebels said, government forces had been pushed farther west -- away from the city. Misrata has borne the brunt of the fighting in Libya for the past two months. More than 1,000 people are believed to have been killed here since early February, including 686 civilian residents. Gadhafi's forces laid siege to Misrata and cut off land access, leaving the port as the only escape route. They retreated to the perimeters but were trying to regain control of the city, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) east of Tripoli. In Washington, Sen. Carl Levin emerged from a meeting of the U.S. Armed Services Committee and appeared pleased with NATO's progress. ""I am satisfied that Gadhafi's military has been severely degraded, that politically he has been significantly weakened, that the NATO operations are going well, they are coordinated and we have not lost one person yet,"" the Democrat from Michigan said. The committee chairman rejected the term ""stalemate"" to describe the effort, which has lasted nearly three months. But Sen. Jeff Sessions, also a member of the committee, expressed impatience over NATO's pace of progress in the northern African country. ""I'm not sure we are acting with decisive abilities that we have to impact the outcome,"" the Republican from Alabama said. ""I felt like, had we moved aggressively, as Senator (John) Kerry (D-Massachusetts) and Senator (John) McCain (R-Arizona) suggested in the beginning, maybe the matter would be concluded by now."" In Brussels, Belgium, outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates blasted NATO as a ""two-tiered"" alliance poorly equipped to deal with challenges. In his farewell speech Friday to the NATO Council, he contrasted those members ""willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of NATO membership ... but don't want to share the risks and the costs."" Gates had harsh words for the conduct of the air campaign against Gadhafi's regime. He said it had become ""painfully clear"" that shortcomings could ""jeopardize the alliance's ability to conduct an integrated, effective and sustained air-sea campaign."" ""While every alliance member voted for the Libya mission, less than half have participated at all, and fewer than a third have been willing to participate in the strike mission,"" he said. Gates concluded with a warning about American willingness to continue bearing a growing part of the NATO burden. ""The blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress ... to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be a serious and capable partners in their own defense,"" he said. NATO members must better allocate their resources, follow through on commitments and protect defense budgets from being ""further gutted"" to avoid ""a dismal future,"" Gates said. His warning came on the same day that Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Turkish broadcaster NTV that Turkey had offered Gadhafi some guarantees, including helping him seek another country of residence, if he were to step down. ""Unfortunately, we still have not received a response from him,"" he said. On Thursday, global powers charting out the course of a post-Gadhafi Libya met in the United Arab Emirates. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others urged the international community to sustain pressure on the Libyan regime. An opposition spokesman predicted Gadhafi would fall within days. But Friday's fighting was evidence that, despite 10,439 sorties carried out by NATO jets and a fierce opposition revolt, Gadhafi was holding strong. In a three-page letter purportedly from Gadhafi to the U.S. Congress that was given to CNN by the office of House Speaker John Boehner, the writer calls for a cease-fire. ""Let's stop the destruction and begin the negotiations to find a peaceful solution for Libya,"" it says. ""I appeal to you, as the great Democracy, to assist us to determine our future as a people."" The letter calls the NATO military effort ""inappropriate and illegal interference in what is essentially a Libyan civil war."" ""If authentic, this incoherent letter only reinforces that Gadhafi must go,"" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. ""There's no disagreement about that.  That's why so many Americans have questions -- which the White House refuses to answer -- about the administration committing U.S. resources to an operation that doesn't make his removal a goal."" A senior administration official told CNN that the letter ""probably"" is genuine but added that Gadhafi  ""obviously didn't write it, for it's not weird enough."" The official said it was not clear what the letter meant. ""It will be hard to take seriously that he wants to talk about transition when he won't even take the bare minimum steps of putting a cease-fire into place,"" the official said. Meanwhile, NATO officials have said repeatedly that airstrikes are aimed solely at military targets, but a senior NATO military official with operational knowledge of the Libya mission has told CNN that attacking Gadhafi was justified under the United Nations mandate. The resolution applies to the Libyan leader because, as head of the military, he is part of the command-and-control structure and therefore a legitimate target, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official was not authorized to talk to the media. But the NATO official declined to give a direct answer when asked whether Gadhafi was being targeted. NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu, however, said the alliance was not specifically targeting Gadhafi. ""We are targeting critical military capabilities that could be used to attack civilians, including command-and-control centers that could be used to plan and organize such attacks,"" Lungescu said. CNN Foreign Affairs Correspondent Jill Dougherty contributed to this story.","At a field hospital, doctors didn't take the time to count the dozens of wounded .

"(CNN) -- Ukrainian forces have taken full control of Donetsk airport as they continue to fight pro-Russian rebels in the eastern Ukraine city, a Ukrainian military spokesman says. ""The active stage of the counter-terrorist operation continues. The government is now at full control of the airport and the road leading to it,"" Vladislav Seleznev told CNN. Meantime, two people were killed in fighting in the city, the Donetsk City Council said in an online statement. The council warned residents not to leave their homes. ""The bus station is closed. Car movement is limited. A nine-story residential building at the train station area has been damaged. A market outside the train station caught on fire as the result of artillery fire. Still, the train station is working,"" it said. Donetsk is west of the area where Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed Thursday, with the loss of 298 lives. The United States says a Russian-made surface-to-air missile fired from pro-Russian rebel territory took down the Boeing 777. Russia has blamed Kiev's resumption of military operations against the rebels at the end of June for the tragedy, while the U.S. has accused Russia of supporting the rebels that Washington believes fired the missile. Since the crash, Ukraine's government and rebels have traded bitter accusations over who was responsible. The Ukraine government says ""terrorists"" fired on the plane. Ukrainian officials have distributed recordings of what they say are intercepted communications between pro-Russian rebels discussing shooting it down. Alexander Borodai, the rebel leader who calls himself the Prime Minister of the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic, has conceded that the plane was shot down but says his forces did not do it. He told CNN on Sunday that his forces lack the firepower to hit an airplane so high up. The Ukraine crisis has its roots in former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to shun a European Union association agreement last year and work with Russia instead. The move unleashed deadly strife that led to Yanukovych's ouster, Russia's annexation of Crimea and a pro-Russian rebellion.","Official: Ukrainian forces continue to fight pro-Russian rebels in the eastern Ukraine city .

"American blues guitarist and singer Johnny Winter died Wednesday in a hotel room in Switzerland, his representative said Thursday. He was 70. ""His wife, family and bandmates are all saddened by the loss of their loved one and one of the world's finest guitarists,"" his spokeswoman, Lori Haynes, said. Winter was in Zurich, Switzerland, as part of a tour of Europe, although he was scheduled to return to the United States for shows later in July, according to his official Facebook page. Winter first gained national attention when Rolling Stone magazine featured the the Texas music scene in a December 1968 cover story. It captioned his photo: ""Johnny Winter, Albino Bluesman.""  The article said guitarist Mike Bloomfield considered the young Winter the ""best white blues guitarist he had ever heard."" Rolling Stone now ranks Winter 63rd on its list of 100 greatest guitarists. Winter's family moved from Mississippi to Beaumont, Texas, when he was an infant. Johnny and brother Edgar, who was nearly three years younger, both were born with albinism, a melanin production deficiency that left them with little color in their hair, skin and eyes. Winter was just 15 in 1959 when he began playing guitar in Texas clubs. It was also the year he started drinking and smoking. ""It seemed a big year for me,"" Winter told an interviewer for the documentary ""Johnny Winter: Down & Dirty."" The film was released this year. Another big year for Winter was 1969, when he played at the Woodstock festival. ""One week we're playing clubs for about 20 people and in a matter of a few months we're playing Woodstock,"" bassist Tommy Shannon said in the documentary. Columbia Records won a bidding war for Winter that resulted in a self-titled debut album, followed by a second titled ""Second Winter"" in late 1969. Though none of his several dozen albums earned a Grammy, he shared three for producing blues legend Muddy Waters in the late 1970s. Winter announced this year that he had another album ready for release in September.  ""Step Back"" will include contributions from guests including Eric Clapton, Joe Perry and Dr. John, according to his official website. His summer tour schedule was filled with shows, including 15 concerts planned across the United States in August. Winter was asked in the documentary if he every dreamed that playing a guitar would take him around the world. ""I was almost always sure it would,"" Winter said. ""I was sure I was going to be successful. ""It's the only thing that I've really been good at."" Winter opened up about his heroin, prescription pill and alcohol addictions that derailed his career in the 1980s and 1990s in an authorized biography ""Raisin' Cain - The Wild and Raucous Story of Johnny Winter,"" published in 2010. His resurgence began after he fired a longtime manager in 2005 and hired fellow musician Paul Nelson to guide his career. ""I think that Johnny now is really coming back to being himself,"" brother Edgar Winter said in the just-released documentary. People we've lost in 2014 .","A new Johnny Winter album with Eric Clapton, Joe Perry is due in September .

"Wings clipped, noses cut off, stripped down to the bone, these old birds will never fly again. But the giant hangar at the home of Tarmac Aerosave is not a graveyard for planes -- it's a recycling yard. Tarmac Aerosave has been dismantling disused aircraft at its base in ""Aerospace Valley"" -- a cluster of French flight engineering firms near the town of Tarbes in southern France -- since it was formed in 2009. Although the company's primary business remains aircraft storage, it has stripped 12 planes completely since its inception . ""We receive an old aircraft ... and completion of this work (is) when all the material can be reused,"" says Sebastien Medan, head of dismantling at the French aerospace company . Where planes go to die . The parts salvaged during this process are repackaged and repurposed. Landing gear and wing flaps are shipped out to be reinstalled in new planes while cockpits are reborn as flight simulators. All parts that are saved can be sold on by the aircraft owners. The remaining waste and scrap metal, meanwhile, is broken down for resale by Tarmac. ""The percentage of the aircraft to be recycled is around 87% (and) actually we expect to rise that to 90%"" says Medan. See also: In-flight phone calls to become standard . With Tarmac's parent company, Airbus, predicting that more than 9,000 aircraft will be retired or withdrawn from service over the next 20 years, there's a clear need for aging planes to be disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. By relieving retired models of their most valuable assets, Tarmac also believes it can transform airplane recycling into a lucrative business and one that makes sense for airlines looking to dispose of old models. The cost of storing a disused aircraft can be as much as €20,000 ($25,000) per month. This compares to a one-off cost of between €100,000 and €150,000 (between $125,000 and $185,000) to tear down a plane, stripping it of items that can be reused or sold on at a profit. A conductor who loves the sound of fighter jets: These people really love to fly . ""All the materials we take out from each aircraft could be used in other industry, especially aeronautical industry,"" says Medan. While the efficiency savings this process brings are obvious, Tarmac also believes that dismantling old planes will allow engineers to better design more efficient aircraft in the future. Understanding how parts erode, decay or develop over time will allow them to transfer that knowledge into new designs. ""We are collecting in-service aircraft components to asses the remaining characteristics and capability in terms of stress and fatigue,"" says Olivier Malavallon, project director of business development and change at Airbus. ""It's crucial in terms of experienced feedback in better designing the aircraft and providing to the designer some guidance -- how best we can assemble things together where things are fitting better."" As it stands, Tarmac's site in southern France can cater for 20 aircraft at a time, the company says. Across the border in northern Spain, however, a new site is being prepared by one of the company's subsidiaries. It will be able to store 200 planes at a time, and strip down between 30 and 40 models a year. According to Malavallon this expansion will enable Tarmac to prepare for the coming influx of retiring planes. It will also ensure aircraft are disposed of in a way that is efficient and makes the most of valuable materials. Instead of ""going from cradle to grave,"" he says, airplanes will go from ""cradle to cradle."" You told us: Top 5 spots for plane geeks .

"Republican victories nationwide in this Tuesday's midterm elections gave the GOP's possible presidential hopefuls a surge of momentum Tuesday night as they enter a period of serious consideration of their own White House bids. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who plans to huddle with close aides in Washington, D.C. next week to discuss his political future, seized the moment first by claiming the election result were not just a repudiation of President Barack Obama, but to Hillary Clinton — the likely Democratic presidential nominee -- as well. ""Hillary Clinton was very active in Kentucky,"" Paul told CNN's Brianna Keilar at an event for Sen. Mitch McConnell, referring to Clinton's multiple stops in the Bluegrass State for Democratic challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes. ""The interesting thing is, Ms. Grimes decided she was going to run as a Clinton Democrat,"" he continued. ""Well I think we soundly rejected that in Kentucky, also in Arkansas."" (Sen. Mark Pryor, a Democrat with close ties to the Clintons, was defeated in Arkansas Tuesday night by Republican Tom Cotton.) Paul has been hounding Clinton and her record as Secretary of State for much of the past year. But with the midterms mostly over now, his attacks will carry more weight with 2016 now squarely in the political spotlight. In Paul's speech introducing McConnell earlier in the night, he also repeated an attack line he's been saying about Clinton, hitting her on her recent comment about businesses not creating jobs. ""We say to Hillary Clinton: Yes, businesses do create jobs,"" he said. Paul lamented that it will be ""two long years until we get to replace this president."" But he warned — in a not-so-subtle way — that if the President vetoes Republican bills, ""then in 2016 the people will rise up and reclaim our heritage and elect a lover of liberty who will restore the values of our founding fathers."" When Paul spoke at McConnell's election night party in Louisville, his official Twitter account even reposted a message from a follower about how supporters shouted to him to run for president. The errant — but revealing -- tweet was deleted three seconds later. While Paul was by far the most brazen about tying the election to Clinton, others expressed optimism about the party's future — and their place in it. In Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz, another Republican facing similar calls to run in 2016, used the GOP victory to solidify his place as an uncompromising conservative who appeals to the party base by calling for more votes to repeal the President's health care law. In effort to set himself apart in a way that could promise more trouble ahead between him and other Republicans, Cruz even refused to say if he would support McConnell as Senate Majority Leader. ""That will be a decision for the conference to make,"" Cruz told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Cruz declined to answer further questions about whether he would vote to support McConnell or not. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who also spent Election Night in Texas, expressed a completely different message about the aftermath of the evening's results. Bush emphasized governing — which would require Republicans to work with Democrats, given that the party won't have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate and Obama's continued presence in the White House. ""Republicans in Congress now have the opportunity -- and the responsibility -- to demonstrate to American voters that our party can effectively govern,"" Bush said in a statement. ""That requires pursuing and passing a serious growth agenda for our nation that expands opportunity for all Americans."" New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, the head of the Republican Governors Association who barnstormed states in the weekend before election day, delivered statements of congratulations for the GOP governors who won Tuesday night. Democrats, meanwhile, remained mostly silent Tuesday night in the face of a wave of party losses. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joseph Biden and outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, all Democrats considering White House runs, did not release statements on Election Night. Regardless, these possible White House contenders spent the past several months campaigning and fundraising for candidates across the country, an investment that will help encourage those they helped to support them if they choose to run next year. (Clinton, for example, spoke at 45 events for Democrats, and Christie visited 15 states for Republicans in just the past five days.  Others kept similarly ambitious schedules.) While those trips could be portrayed before the elections as merely providing a helping hand for a tough mid-term battle, they set the foundation for the next two years and the race for the White House.

"Texas Republicans have adopted a party platform that includes support for voluntary psychological ""therapy"" targeted at converting homosexuals to heterosexuals. Almost 10,000 attendees gathered in Fort Worth at the annual Texas GOP Convention to vote on a platform ahead of the 2016 race for the White House. Supporters of  ""conversion"" or ""reparative"" therapy believe the treatment is effective in turning gays straight. California and New Jersey have banned the treatment for minors. The Texas Republicans' measure states that ""We recognize the legitimacy and efficacy of counseling, which offers reparative therapy and treatment for those patients seeking healing and wholeness from their homosexual lifestyle. No laws or executive orders shall be imposed to limit or restrict access to this type of therapy."" Spearheading the endorsement  is Cathie Adams, president of the conservative Texas Eagle Forum. She stressed that the measure calls for allowing people to choose the treatment. ""Nothing is mandatory,"" Adams wrote in an e-mail to CNN on Saturday. ""If a person chooses counseling, then it should be made available. California and New Jersey have passed bills OUTLAWING it altogether, which is under litigation. It's a freedom issue."" But an array of professional organizations oppose gay conversion therapy. Such groups include the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association. ""The most important fact about these 'therapies' is that they are based on a view of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major mental health professions,"" said the APA, the nation's largest scientific and professional organization representing psychology. ""To date, there has been no scientifically adequate research to show that therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation ... is safe or effective."" Adams told CNN in a phone interview she was introduced to reparative treatment by a constituent in her precinct who claimed he was a gay man who is now straight because of such treatment. ""I do not think homosexuals are born as homosexuals,"" Adams said. ""To say this is an unchangeable thing, there are too many people who've changed their mind about homosexuality. No one can change the color of their skin or change the place they're born, but they can definitely choose their lifestyles,"" she added. Last August, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed into law a measure banning gay conversion therapy for minors. ""The American Psychological Association has found that efforts to change sexual orientations can pose critical health risks including, but not limited to, depression, substance abuse, social withdrawal, decreased self-esteem and suicidal thoughts,"" the Republican governor said in his signing statement. ""I believe that exposing children to these health risks without clear evidence of benefits that outweigh these serious risks is not appropriate.""","""Reparative therapy"" aims to turn gays straight .

"Pope Francis washed the feet of a dozen prisoners, including young women, at a youth detention center in Rome as part of a Holy Thursday Mass ahead of Easter. The pontiff poured water over the young offenders' feet, wiped them with a white towel and kissed them. The act of foot-washing at the Mass of the Lord's Supper is part of the Christian tradition that mirrors Jesus' washing of his disciples' feet. Francis' decision to celebrate the Mass with young offenders at the Casal del Marmo center represents a break with tradition but is in step with his record in embracing simplicity and humility. The service has in past years been held at the grand Basilica of St. John Lateran, the official seat of the bishop of Rome. This time, the Mass ""will be, by his express desire, very simple,"" the Vatican said before the service. The young offenders were expected to give the pope a wooden crucifix and kneeler, which they made themselves in the detention center's workshop. In return, Francis was to bring Easter eggs and colomba, traditional Italian Easter cake in the shape of a dove, for all, the Vatican had said. The Casal del Marmo center houses close to 50 inmates, who range in age from 14 to 21. The young people who had their feet washed were chosen from different nationalities and diverse religious backgrounds. Two young women and two Muslims were included in the rite, according to the Vatican. Why is the pope washing prisoners' feet? More than 2,000 cardinals, archbishops, bishops and priests, as well as more than 10,000 of the Roman Catholic faithful, joined the pope in celebrating Mass in St. Peter's Basilica on Thursday morning. Francis urged the priests to be close to their congregations and listen to their everyday concerns, even if those concerns sometimes appear material or mundane. The priests should be ""shepherds who have the smell of their sheep,"" he said. Reaching out to the 'forgotten' Francis was installed as pope 10 days ago, having been elected to fill the shoes of Benedict XVI. Since taking on the role, he has focused on a message of helping the poor and needy. In his first general audience Wednesday, before crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square, he spoke of how following Christ ""means learning to come out of ourselves ... in order to meet others, in order to go toward the edges of our existence, to take the first steps towards our brothers and sisters, especially those who are farthest from us, those who are forgotten, those who need understanding, consolation and assistance."" He also called for an end to the violence in the Central African Republic, where a coalition of rebels ousted President Francois Bozize this week. All those suffering in the African nation are in his prayers, he said. ""I call for an immediate halt to the violence and looting, and that a political solution to the crisis may be reached as soon as possible so that peace and harmony may be restored in that dear country, which has, for too long, been marked by conflict and division,"" he said. The Holy Week services will culminate on Easter Sunday with the pope's first ""Urbi et Orbi"" blessing, directed to the city of Rome and to the world.","Pope Francis washes the feet of 12 young offenders, including women and Muslims .

"It's a blazingly warm day in Rio de Janeiro and people flock to the Copacabana beach for a swim in the sea and a round of volleyball. The World Cup and the Olympic and Paralympic Games are approaching, and from high above, the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue is watching over the city. But there are others watching, too. Not far away from the bustling scene at Copacabana, city employees in white jumpsuits are making sure the 6.3 million Cariocas -- Rio locals -- are safe. Sitting in front of a wall of screens, they collect and analyze real-time data of what's going on in the city. Here, they can identify and help prevent anything from landslides to traffic jams.  This is the master control of the city -- the Operations Center. Its control room boasts an 80 square meter high-definition video wall --- the biggest in Latin America. Combined with the identical white jumpsuits everyone's sporting, it could very well be straight out of NASA. ""It's like our Big Brother, not in a private sense but in a sense where we can watch everything that is going on, that's happening in the city,"" Rio's mayor Eduardo Paes told CNN during a tour of the state-of-the-art Operations Center. A smarter city welcomes the world . Brazil's growing economy and the fact that Rio will host the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016 have reinforced the city's focus on sustainable initiatives. The mayor's vision is very clear: he plans to make Rio safer and to improve its infrastructure. The Operations Center means that the mayor now has more information about his city that he can use towards other initiatives. ""I sleep better thanks to it. The worst thing is not having the information, to not have the tools to act. But we do now,"" Paes says. Read more: Mayor's dream big, redefine urban living . The video wall in the center displays live information from 560 cameras, a weather forecasting system and a smart map capable of analyzing 60 different layers of data streamed from sensors around the city. The mayor commissioned IBM to set up the Operations Center in 2010, following a storm that killed 68 people. ""We integrated more than 20 city agencies into one central command center, decreasing emergency response times by 30%,"" says Michael Dixon, head of Smarter Cities for IBM Globally. Paes explains that it was tough to manage the city before the Operations Center was built, since the different departments were spread all over the city. Now they can quickly find solutions to help manage everyday life. ""It's the place where we gather the minds of the city, we gather the departments but we also gather the technology. I would call that a technological center or urban app or urban technology,"" he says. The landslides won't bring us down . Rio is surrounded by many steep hillsides on which most of its favelas, the shanty towns, are built. Up to 20% of Rio's inhabitants live in favelas, and many of them are at risk of landslides. ""We have a history of big floods because of heavy rains and big landslides, especially during summer time,"" says Paes. Rio has hundreds of favelas and the city authorities have launched a regeneration project called 'Morar Carioca' that aims to ""urbanize"" them all by 2020 -- improving the infrastructure in the favelas and integrating them better with the city. ""We use it as a laboratory for new experiments on environmental and environmentally friendly public things,"" Paes says of the project. Read more: Brazil's catadores turn trash into art . But until the favelas are urbanized and safe, the city relies on the Operations Center. So far, Paes is confident his city vision is paying off. ""It's amazing because I would say that the biggest benefits are the bad things that don't happen, that won't come to reality because of it.""","Rio de Janeiro has a greenhouse gas emission of 2.1 tonnes per capita .

"A Memphis, Tennessee, man faces a 45-count indictment after prosecutors say he took money from teachers who paid to have other people take their certification exams. Clarence Mumford, 58, allegedly made tens of thousands of dollars from the scheme, which operated between 1995-2010 and involved teachers and aspiring teachers in Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi. ""Mumford's conduct has done harm to the systems in which unqualified teachers have been able to teach, to the individual schools, to qualified individuals who could have obtained jobs filled by unqualified teachers, and, ultimately, to a generation of our schoolchildren,"" said Edward L. Stanton III, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee. It was not immediately clear whether Mumford has retained representation. According to the indictment, dated Monday, Mumford charged teachers between $1,500-$3,000 per exam. As part of the scheme, he allegedly collected teachers' IDs and made fake driver's licenses. The purported scam involved approximately 70 teachers, according to Kristin Helm, spokeswoman at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations. None were mentioned by name in the indictment. The tests, which are required to obtain licenses, were written and administered under the auspices of Educational Testing Services, or ETS. The organization commented on the case in a statement Tuesday. ""ETS's Office of Testing Integrity brought this case to the attention of local authorities and has worked cooperatively with them to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice. Test security and score validity are paramount to ETS, its clients, and test takers. We are continuing to cooperate with authorities and remain committed to providing fair and valid assessments.

"Donald Trump seems to have hit hard times. The unfortunate fellow has been forced to buy a second-hand 757 from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen for a paltry $100 million -- though he did then coat every metal surface in gold. But had he been feeling really extravagant, he could have thrown the kids' inheritance at a Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) with a new MAX engine -- the latest technological jump from the company that recently unveiled the 747-8, their largest offering to-date and the longest commercial jet in the world. Boeing Business Jets -- the division dedicated to pimping out their commercial airliners and selling them to embarrassingly rich people -- has taken this beast under its wing. The 747-8 Intercontinental is the latest, longest and about the most expensive corporate jet in the world -- a shiny new, ""green"" (empty) 747-8 will set you back $300 million, but with a VIP fit-out the figure is closer to $500 million. But what else is there out there for those with a few hundred million to splash? Also on CNNGo: What's so special about the 787 Dreamliner? The jet set . The traditional Boeing Business Jets are the 700-, 800- and 900ER-series 737s at 34 meters, 40 meters and 42 meters long. You'll pay up to $115 million for the largest of these. At the top end of the line is the superlative-filled super-jumbo. A touch over 76 meters long, the 747-8i VIP also boasts a cabin 6.1 meters wide, dwarfing the BBJ's (only the 737s are referred to as ""BBJs"" -- all other models are ""VIP"") 3.5 meters, and it has up to 525 square meters of floor-space -- two or three times the size of your average house. Then there's the latest engine. Boeing recently announced that the ""MAX"" engine is now available as an option for all new 737 orders for commercial airliners, asserting that it can offer fuel-savings of up to 16 percent over competitors. ""We intend to take advantage of the improved efficiency of the new 737 MAX family for our BBJ product line,"" says BBJ president Steve Taylor. ""We've studied the capabilities of all the MAX variants and of course they offer significant range, economic and environmental benefits over the current line of BBJ products."" Also on CNNGo: World's biggest model airport . Who's buying? Boeing is tight-lipped about who, exactly, is buying these ""flying castles"" -- apparently crazy-rich people cherish their anonymity -- but can reveal that almost half of the 206 BBJs and VIPs ordered since their launch in 1996 have gone to private owners, and a third of them have headed for the Middle East. Trump's ""new"" 757 is basically a 20-year-old 737, but with a fuselage that's five meters longer. With a poky floor-space of 125 square meters and a range of around 8,000 kilometers, it's a far cry from the 747-8 VIP, whose range is over 17,000 kilometers. But for the multi-millionaire tech-heads who just have to possess the very latest technology, and you're less concerned about spacious luxury than you are about speed, there's a new corporate jet dubbed the Arion SBJ that'll get you from A to B at Mach 2 for the bargain price of $80 million. The release date's not set, but pre-orders are now open. The company claims to have $4 billion worth of ""letters of intent"" for what will no doubt be the gem at every air show for years to come.

"Washington (CNN) -- Faced with a divided public over his signature legislative achievement, President Barack Obama on Wednesday hailed the health care reform bill passed in March as important for helping both the government and the American people deal with rising medical costs. The measure endured a bitter political fight that saw no Republicans vote for its final approval, and recent polls show it remains controversial as Democrats face congressional elections in November amid a tough climate due to lingering economic woes. Obama, at a carefully orchestrated meeting with people who have benefited from health care reform, told them that their stories are the best way to counter what one participant called ""misinformation"" spread by opponents of the measure. ""We are now actually able to provide some help to the American people,"" Obama said, noting new provisions under the bill that take effect Thursday -- the six-month anniversary of the day he signed it into law. The new provisions will end lifetime limits on coverage; ensure coverage of children with pre-existing medical conditions; allow parents to keep children on their policies until the age of 26; halt the practice of rescission, in which insurance companies drop coverage for arbitrary reasons; and cover preventive health practices, Obama said. Responding to a Republican argument that the health care bill represents a government takeover of health care, Obama said the bill's provisions are instead ""designed to make sure you're getting what you paid for."" Democrats had planned to tout the health care bill's passage in their campaigns for the November 2 election, but some are backing off because of some people's continued negative perceptions. According to a CBS News/New York Times survey conducted this month, almost half of respondents said they did not approve of the measure while 37 percent said they approved. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. national poll conducted in early September indicated that 46 percent of the public says that Democrats in Congress will do a better job on health care, while 45 percent say congressional Republicans will do a better job on the issue. Republican leaders are calling for the measure to be repealed, or at least diminished, if their party wins control of Congress in November. They say it will increase health care costs for businesses and individuals, hurting the economy. A group of House Republicans who are doctors said later Wednesday that some of the new benefits cited by Obama are good, but the measure still should be repealed. ""These are the kind of things that the American people understand,"" said Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Georgia, adding that such benefits didn't need ""a 2,400-page bill"" to enact them. ""When we go back and repeal, we will keep these things,"" Gingrey said. Obama repeated arguments from the debate over the bill, saying how the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office predicted the reforms would eventually reduce the government burden for health care costs by up to $1 trillion. He noted how the plan also helps senior citizens with prescription drug costs, first by a $250 check paid this year and later by eliminating a current gap in coverage. Obama's appearance was intended to highlight how the reforms have directly helped American families. Held in the back yard of a Virginia home, it featured people from all over the country provided microphones to relate their experiences and ask questions. Gail O'Brien of Keene, New Hampshire, told how she had no health coverage when diagnosed in March with high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer. Because of the health reform law, she put off treatment until July, when insurance companies were banned from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, she said. Now she feels great, she said, thanking Obama because ""if it wasn't for this bill, I probably would not have been feeling great because I would have been so stressed out worrying about how we would pay for my medical bills."" Obama mentioned the call by House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, to repeal the health care bill and said Boehner should have to look O'Brien in the eye and tell her, ""Sorry, Gail, you can't afford health insurance."" ""I don't think that's what this country stands for,"" Obama said. He emphasized how the health care bill helps small businesses by providing tax breaks to those that provide coverage to their workers. Two of the participants backed him up by saying that before the bill, they faced the choice of either dropping coverage for their workers or going out of business. Betsy Burton, who runs the King's English book store in Salt Lake City, Utah, said the bill ""makes a massive difference in the state of our business"" and asked what could be done about the misinformation against the bill. Jim Houser of Portland, Oregon, said health care premiums for his 14 workers doubled over the last seven years, but the tax credits now lowered the cost to 2008 levels. ""That's like a time machine in terms of our premiums,"" Houser said, adding it would allow him to keep providing coverage for his employees. Another woman told how she was able to get coverage for her young son despite a serious eye condition. Dawn Josephson of Jacksonville, Florida, remembered being shocked when she realized the insurance company could no longer deny coverage due to a pre-existing condition. ""I said, 'Wow, something affected me personally from the government,"" Josephson said. ""Thank you and everyone for pushing this through."" Obama concluded the gathering by telling how his daughter Sasha contracted meningitis when 3 months old, and his feeling of desperation as she was hospitalized and he wondered how he could have paid for it without health insurance. ""That's what this is about,"" he said, adding: ""Ultimately, the thing that's most important is we've just got to give people some basic peace of mind."" Before the event, Obama met with state insurance commissioners to discuss how the bill was affecting their work and the ability of states to deal with the changes. Some noted that meeting timelines for changes in the legislation would cost states significant resources, while the commissioner from North Carolina cited a benefit. Policies carrying excess contract reserves have been renegotiated at lower rates, bringing cost savings to participants, said the official, Wayne Goodwin. CNN's Alan Silverleib and Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","NEW: Republicans call for repealing the health care bill, but keeping some benefits .

"I recently led a bipartisan congressional delegation to the Middle East and Europe to discuss regional security issues with key American partners.  Beyond the strategic challenges posed by the Arab Spring lies an urgent threat -- Iran's determination to achieve nuclear weapons capability. Iran's effort, if successful, could destabilize the Middle East, spur a regional nuclear arms race and undermine America's influence in this pivotal region. Unfortunately, the window to solve this problem without conflict gets smaller with each passing day as Iran attempts to master the enrichment of uranium.  Several administrations have tried engaging Iran and offering security guarantees, but that has not prevented the country from pursuing the bomb or patronizing the world's most dangerous terrorist groups. Economic and diplomatic pressures haven't worked either, but they have been episodic, gradual and largely unilateral. While the U.S. left Iran's market years ago, we can still exert great pressure through financial sanctions, and President Barack Obama should do so. Our partners in Europe, Asia and the Middle East can and should do more to amplify the effect of U.S. sanctions if they are serious about stopping Iran's nuclear proliferation. Some influential countries, however, may be unwilling to pay the costs associated with greater multilateral sanctions, either because they do not feel threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran or they see utility in having the U.S. being consumed with that threat.  In the weeks ahead, it will be actions, not words, that demonstrate which countries are truly committed to stopping Iran. The latest round of European sanctions is designed to compel Iran to come back to the negotiating table. If the Iranians do so, the desire for a deal at any cost should not be permitted to overshadow our long experience in negotiating with rogue states.  We must focus on the results rather than the process of negotiations. With its nuclear centrifuges continuing to spin, Iran cannot be allowed -- as it has been in the past -- to further delay this process. Mere promises cannot be rewarded with a loosening of pressure. Iran's leaders must feel dramatic pressure that imperils their very hold on power until their abandonment of nuclear program can be verified. It is possible that only a strategy that jeopardizes the hard-line clerics' hold on power in Tehran will give the Iranian regime sufficient reason to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Frankly, the Obama administration missed an opportunity to stand with Iran's dissidents when they rose up against their oppressive rulers after the rigged elections in 2009.  It is hard to believe a less ideological government would be as intransigent as the current regime. Perhaps further sanctions could breathe new life into the budding democratic movement that for a brief moment brought a glimmer of hope to the Iranian people. In addition to sanctions, we must actively combat Iran's influence throughout the Middle East. Our partners are perplexed at what they perceive as our lackadaisical response to Iran's support of extremist proxies. And in Iraq, our partners believe that America's abandonment of that country has left a vacuum that Iran is only too eager to fill.  It is hard to see why the Obama administration has not expended more effort in trying to keep Iraq -- a potentially rich and influential country at the heart of the Middle East that was liberated at such great cost -- more firmly in the American camp. Finally, there is the low-hanging fruit of Syria. Bashar al-Assad's regime may be Iran's most important strategic partner. Instead of aggressively combating Syria's support to Hamas and Hezballah and interference in Lebanon and Iraq, the Obama administration came to office seeking to engage al-Assad. It failed. Now the president has finally acknowledged that it's time for al-Assad to go. America should not defer to obstinate Russian diplomats at the United Nations about Syria. Instead, we should lead an international effort to apply tremendous pressure on Syria and provide demonstrable support to its growing political opposition. The longer the Syrian crackdown is allowed to continue, the greater the risk of chaos and the harder it will be to put Syria back together. If Syria goes down, it would be a serious blow to the Iranian regime. There is no substitute for American leadership in the Middle East. It is time for the Obama administration to show it. Without recourse to war, these steps represent the best hope of confronting the challenges posed by Iran's nuclear proliferation and patronage of terrorism. If these measures ultimately fail, the international community may be forced to confront the difficult decision of using military force in face of an implacable Iran. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sexual assault incidents within the Veterans Affairs system are not being reported up the chain, a new government audit released Tuesday found. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress, reported that of nearly 300 sexual assault incidents reported to VA Police from January 2007 through July 2010, ""many"" were not reported to VA leadership officials and the VA Inspector General's Office. The GAO report uses the term sexual assault incident to refer to ""suspected, alleged, attempted, or confirmed cases of sexual assault."" The 284 cases of sexual assault included rape, inappropriate touching, forceful medical examinations, forced or inappropriate oral sex, and other types of sexual assault incidents. ""When I first read this report, I was aghast,"" said Rep. Jeff Miller, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. ""It reminded me of a 1950s prison system -- lawlessness, lack of security and reporting, and outright disregard for human dignity."" The House committee has scheduled a hearing on the matter for Monday. The GAO says the VA agreed with most of its findings. Nearly two-thirds of the 67 rape allegations in VA facilities were not reported to the VA Inspector General's Office, as required by VA regulation, according to the report. Both men and women were victims of the assaults. The victims and attackers ranged from employees to patients to those without affiliation to the VA. ""Not all sexual assault incidents reported to VA Police are substantiated,"" the GAO report said, citing reasons such as an assault did not actually take place, the victim chose not to pursue the case or there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the case. The investigators say underreporting is due to a lack of guidance on what constitutes a sexual assault, unclear expectations on what incidents should be reported and insufficient oversight by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which oversees VA health facilities. The VHA does not have a system to track and trend sexual assaults over time, according to the report, and therefore ""cannot identify and make changes to serious problems that jeopardize the safety of veterans in their medical facilities."" The report also found that the VA has not taken the proper precautions to prevent sexual assaults in its medical facilities. Among the findings: Investigators report ""poor monitoring of surveillance cameras, alarm system malfunctions, and the failure of alarms to alert both VA police and clinical staff when triggered."" Officials at many of the locations the GAO visited said the VA Police were also understaffed. ""Patient and employee safety and security are paramount at the VA,"" said VA press secretary Josh Taylor. ""We take all allegations seriously and investigate them thoroughly."" The VA says it's in process of reviewing the GAO's recommendations and taking steps to improve reporting of allegations and to provide more secure facilities. ""The bottom line is that we have a responsibility to protect those veterans in our care, as they have protected our nation, and we will continue to strengthen our facilities to ensure that our veterans receive high-quality medical care in safe, secure facilities,"" Taylor said. The investigation was launched at the request of the House Veterans Affairs Committee due to changing demographics of patients treated by the VA. The VA has developed initiatives to attract specific veteran populations to use its services, including women, young veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, and veterans facing legal issues or those already incarcerated, the report said. The VA operates the largest integrated health care system in the country, with 153 hospitals and about 700 community-based clinics.","GAO report says many incidents not properly handled .

"(CNN) -- There was nothing flashy about Judy Clarke, nothing to announce, ""Here's the high-profile criminal attorney,"" as she stood in court Monday beside the man accused in the Arizona rampage killings. But Clarke is, perhaps, the best defense lawyer you've never heard of. A longtime colleague calls her lack of ego ""almost freakish."" She faces an uphill battle defending Jared Lee Loughner, who shaved his head and offered an unsettling smile for his mug shot. The crime is shocking, and her client already is publicly reviled. But public defenders are the embodiment of a criminal justice system that believes everyone is innocent until proved guilty, that even people accused of horrific crimes deserve someone to stand up for them and find their humanity. Many of Clarke¹s colleagues believe she is the perfect lawyer for the job. ""Judy is as genuine as a person can be,"" said David I. Bruck, who attended law school with Clarke and has worked on cases with her. ""She explodes every myth about lawyers. She is motivated by a passion to stick up for the little guy, and there is nobody littler than a defendant accused of a horrendous crime who everybody wants to string up."" Loughner, 22, is charged in federal court with five crimes, including killing a federal judge and congressional aide and attempting to assassinate U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. He also faces prosecution in the state courts for allegedly killing four others, including a child, outside a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona. Already, there is talk of the death penalty. ""I'm glad she's on the case. She's a great lawyer,"" said Quin Denvir, a former federal public defender from Sacramento, California. Denvir recruited Clarke to help him with the Unabomber case. ""She's a walking encyclopedia, she knows the law, and she has great empathy for the client,"" he added. ""She does it all."" The federal bench in Arizona stepped down Tuesday from handling the Loughner case because one of its own, U.S. District Judge John Roll, is among the dead. The decision came a day after Clarke quietly raised the point in court. Legal colleagues consider Clarke, 58, to be the nation's foremost expert on defending federal capital cases. ""I really can't think of anyone better to assign as defense counsel to this case,"" said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School and a former federal prosecutor. ""She is familiar with the federal death penalty, insanity defenses, high-profile cases, and difficult clients. The defendant is going to need good counsel, and he's got it."" Clarke has no taste for designer clothes, sound bites or talking heads. In fact, she has absolutely no use for the media. As a public defender, she didn't need publicity to hustle up paying clients. She was on a government salary, and there was no shortage of poor defendants. For much of her 30-year career, Clarke ran the federal public defender's offices in San Diego, California, and Spokane, Washington. In the mid-1990s, she became the first federal public defender to head the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Now, even though she is in private practice, other public defenders seek her help on the tough cases. And so, Clarke prefers to do her talking to judges, juries, other lawyers and law students. Not surprisingly, Clarke did not return CNN's calls for comment. But she spoke freely last year with the magazine at Washington and Lee University Law School, where she and her husband teach, as does Bruck. She is a visiting professor, teaching third-year law students, and she articulated the philosophy that defines her as a defense lawyer: . ""We stand between the power of the state and the individual, and in doing so defend the core values that make this country great,"" Clarke said. ""None of us, including those accused of a crime, wants to be defined by the worst moment, or the worst day of our lives."" Colleagues say Clarke is highly effective. An ardent opponent of the death penalty, she has kept some of the nation's most despised criminal's -- baby killers, bombers, white supremacists and terrorists -- off death row. You might know some of her clients by the public nicknames they acquired: the Unabomber, the Olympic Park bomber and the 20th hijacker. Clarke is so relentless, her work ethic so formidable, that she often seems driven. But her ambition is not for herself, colleagues say. She believes in the system. She was raised in Asheville, North Carolina, and graduated in 1974 from Furman College in Greenville, South Carolina. She received her law degree in 1977 from the University of South Carolina Law School, where Bruck was a couple of years ahead of her and served as a student adviser. Her talent was immediately apparent, he said. Later, as a defense attorney in South Carolina, Bruck recruited Clark to help him defend Susan Smith, the emotionally disturbed mother who in October 1994 strapped her two boys into her car and let it roll into a lake, drowning them. The defense argued that it was a failed suicide attempt. It was Clarke's first capital case. ""This is not a case about evil,"" she told the jury as the trial began in state court during the summer of 1995. ""This is a case about despair and sadness."" Clarke didn't argue insanity but brought her client's abusive childhood and adult depression alive for the jury. She portrayed Smith as a woman so tormented by her failures in life that she even failed at her own suicide and jumped out of the car. ""She snapped and Michael and Alex are gone,"" Clarke told jurors. ""Susan broke where many of us might bend."" She let jurors feel Smith¹s confusion and pain, and they took 2½ hours to convict Smith of murdering her sons. But they spared her life. Afterward, the judge was so impressed with Clarke¹s work, he increased her pay to $83,000. She paid the taxes and donated the money to a nonprofit agency that defends the poor in capital cases. State officials were not so impressed. They passed a law that prohibited out-of-state lawyers from working on South Carolina¹s death penalty cases. That law is still on the books, Bruck said. Clarke went on to join the defense teams in other high-profile capital cases in the federal courts. All were settled through plea bargains that took the death penalty off the table. Among them: . Ted Kaczynski: The mathematician known as the Unabomber pleaded guilty in January 1998 to making and transporting bomb materials that killed three people. Federal prosecutors in Sacramento, California, backed away from the death penalty after their own expert diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic. Buford O. Furrow: The Aryan Nations member pleaded guilty in 2001 and was sentenced to five life terms for a racially motivated shooting spree at a Los Angeles Jewish Community Center, and the fatal shooting of a Filipino-American postal worker in 1999. Prosecutors dropped the death penalty when the defense documented and charted Furrow's long history of psychiatric treatment for bipolar disorder. The decision later was criticized by the victims' families. Eric Rudolph: The man known as the Olympic Park bomber pleaded guilty in 2005 to bombing a women's clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, and other bombings -- including the one at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. He was a survivalist and spent years on the FBI's most wanted list. Prosecutors dropped the death penalty after Rudolph led them to several dynamite caches in the North Carolina woods. Zacarias Moussaoui: The 9/11 conspirator is sometimes referred to as the 20th hijacker. Clarke worked only briefly on this case. He repeatedly fired his lawyers and insisted on defending himself, abruptly pleading guilty to terror conspiracy charges in July 2002. His life was spared in 2006 when a lone juror held out against a death sentence after a trial punctuated by the defendant's outbursts.","Judy Clarke is considered the nation's foremost expert in defending capital cases .

"Carol Malone never knew her father. She was born in 1942, and her father, U.S. Army Sgt. Victor J. Hubany, was killed in 1944, before he'd been home from war to meet his little girl. She used to watch hours of World War II footage, looking for a glimpse of him. ""I don't even know if he ever saw pictures of me,"" said Malone, now 70. But eight years ago, she made her first-ever trip to visit his gravesite -- in Belgium, his final resting place after battles throughout Europe, including the liberation of Paris. He's just one American fighter whose remains lie in foreign fields, a soldier whose sacrifice is forever commemorated in one of the 24 permanent American burial grounds outside the United States. ""It brought me some peace in my soul. Up until then, I only heard 'You were young then. Your father never came home,'"" Malone said. ""But I don't think I understood until now, at my age now, that he was someone who fought and died. ""When I stood next to his grave, that was the closest I ever was to him, and it was just great."" iReport: Share your story, honor a veteran . About 125,000 U.S. war dead are buried in these overseas resting places. The cemeteries are maintained by the Arlington, Virginia-based American Battle Monuments Commission, which also maintains memorials in New York's Battery Park, San Francisco's Presidio and its newest memorial, the Vietnam Pavilions at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, set to be dedicated on Veterans Day. The battle monuments commission was created by Congress in 1923. Foreign cemeteries for American military members existed earlier, but most conflicts before then were fought at home or incurred fewer casualties. Veterans in Focus: Celebrating service . World War I changed everything. ""Given the number of those killed on all sides, the U.S. did not know what do to. How can you bring this many over? But they also had to figure out a way to commemorate why these men died, their sacrifice,"" said Tim Nosal, the commission's director of public affairs. ""The idea was, if we establish cemeteries, the soldiers and sailors become the monument."" Daughter faces demons of father's war . Among the first cemeteries was Meuse-Argonne in France, containing more than 14,000 American military dead, the largest number interred in a single place in Europe. Today, the overseas cemeteries are visited by family members and history buffs. Many are located near major tourist centers around Europe, although ""they weren't necessarily located because something was popular or beautiful but because something happened with specific meaning,"" Nosal said. Soldier reunites families, Purple Hearts . Families of deceased World War I soldiers were given choices regarding their loved ones' remains. Among them were burial in these overseas cemeteries with perpetual care; return to the United States to a national cemetery or to a family grave site; or sending the remains anywhere in the world, with the family responsible for funeral costs. About 20% of families chose overseas cemeteries. ""They took so many casualties, we decided it was hallowed ground,"" Nosal said, referring to Meuse-Argonne, adding, ""when you leave the cemetery you are literally walking in trenches of the war."" The military repeated the program for World War II, leading to the creation of the battle monument commission's best-known cemetery, Normandy, which appeared in the closing scene of the movie ""Saving Private Ryan."" Legislation in 1947 put World War II cemeteries in the commission's care, as well. ""The Normandy campaign is so important for the world and for the United States and its history. This is why it so resonates with people,"" Nosal said. ""If you think about it, this was the first time the U.S. was leading an Allied force, so it propelled the U.S. into a superpower. This is the beginning of the end for World War II. Hitler would be gone within 11 months."" France has 11 American cemeteries, the most of any other country. Belgium has three, the United Kingdom and Italy, two, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, one. 4 must-sees for military buffs . A few exist outside Europe and some have passed into the battle monument commission's stewardship, such as the oldest, Mexico City National Cemetery. It dates from 1847 and is the burial site of nearly 750 unidentified American soldiers killed in the Mexican-American War, and later from the U.S. Civil War and Spanish-American War. Another cemetery in Panama dates from 1914 with remains of soldiers and others from Panama Canal construction and conflicts. Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines is the largest of the overseas cemeteries, with more than 17,000 Americans, marking World War II's Pacific Theatre. Another in Tunisia holds remains from World War II's North Africa battles. Even earlier battles the U.S. fought in North Africa along with those in Mexico are reflected in a line from the Marines' Hymn: ""From the Halls of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli."" By the Korean War, Nosal said, there was ""a conscious decision to return all the remains back home,"" with technological advances speeding the process. A new overseas memorial -- not a cemetery -- will open next year in Busan, South Korea, in the United Nations Memorial Cemetery and Peace Park. Various travel companies bring Americans to these cemeteries and other war sites. Vietnam veteran Butch Sincock, president of Pennsylvania's MilSpec Tours, believes showing them to a new generation is important. Even if veterans themselves aren't able to go, those close to them can; some of his European tours have included family members of George C. Marshall, an architect of the post-war plan to rebuild Europe. ""World War II vets are literally dying out, unfortunately,"" Sincock said, ""but some of their adult children are taking interest."" Carol Malone's son, Bruce, is superintendent of the commission's Rhône Cemetery in France. Himself a military veteran, he said ""it is an emotional event to visit, but we also show the families the level of care we take for these beautiful memorials. That helps sometimes, that their families, these soldiers are being taken care of very well. It also helps to put into context what happened where they died, and what they were fighting for."" Bruce Malone first learned at age 12 that his grandfather was buried in Belgium after he was killed in 1944. The knowledge ""sparked a love of military history ever since. I can understand what it means to the family to have a relative who never came home."" It was his research that inspired his mother to visit the overseas cemetery on Memorial Day 2004. She weeps now to remember it. ""All you see is row after row of white crosses,"" Carol Malone said. ""You just stand there and you are speechless. You can't imagine until you see it in person, I always think how many gave their lives."" As overwhelming to her was the love locals showed the cemetery. ""One thing I will never forget, the hundreds of people at the memorial,"" she said. ""The Belgian people are so thankful now. There is a group that has adopted my father's grave. They put out flowers and visit my father's grave."" Young Americans might benefit most from a visit, Carol Malone said. ""I don't think it would have been a free country had these men and women not gone over and fought,"" she said. ""We would be living a different life and these young people need to see this.""

Brian Thomas said police were not called to the house until Thursday, when they were contacted by the boy's mother, who had called her son earlier from her job to wake him up but got no response. She found him dead, with a shotgun wound to the chest. The couple is separated. The boy's father lives in suburban St. Louis, about 100 miles northwest of Carterville. Thomas said the department was investigating allegations of bullying made Thursday by the boy's relatives, but had received no such complaints beforehand. ""This bullying has to stop,"" the father said in his video. ""People have to stop treating other people the way they do, because some people just don't have the strength to overcome the humiliation, the continuation of being picked on constantly, every day, to the point that they have no outs."" He pleaded with viewers to contact him with the names of the bulliers. ""I want to find out who those kids were who bullied my son and forced him into taking his life,"" he said. ""The only way for it to stop is to let people know what is going on so that the school can get more involved and that no other lives has to be taken."" Are we too quick to cry 'bully'? He blamed the school video for having presented suicide as an easy out. ""Just go home and take your life,"" he said, instead of offering counseling. A suicide expert said that, while bullying is common, it rarely leads to suicide. ""We view it as a real potential stressor for people who are already vulnerable,"" said Dr. Christine Moutier, medical director at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, in a telephone interview. ""The reality is that there are other factors in there that create that level of distress and hopelessness and desperation."" Asked whether the video may have contributed to the boy's suicide, she said it was impossible to say without having seen it. Join us October 29 for a Google Hangout on bullying .

"(CNN) -- Five people were shot -- four fatally -- at a Seattle, Washington, home Thursday, according to police. Assistant Police Chief Jim Pugel told CNN that a relative of some of the victims who was not in the house believed that a 59-year-old woman, who was the mother of some of the victims, committed the shooting. He told CNN affiliate KOMO TV that the shooter was an Asian female, and that the three other victims are believed to be family members or relatives. Pugel also confirmed for CNN that the dead include two females believed to be in their late teens, a male believed to be in his 30s and the woman believed to be the shooter. There was one survivor, according to Pugel, a woman believed to be in her 30s. Pugel told CNN affiliate KIRO TV that she was undergoing treatment at Harborview Medical Center. She reportedly told emergency responders ""my mom has gone crazy,"" Pugel said. KIRO TV said the shooting was reported about 1:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) in the Highland Park neighborhood of west Seattle. Pugel told KOMO that multiple units responded to the emergency call. He said the responders could hear shots being fired as they arrived. A man who was later determined to be a relative broke through the police line, according to Pugel, and got into the house. Pugel said it was possible that he was the suspect's husband. After he ran into the house, two more shots were fired, Pugel said, adding that the man ran back outside and claimed the woman had shot herself. Pugel also told KOMO that a language barrier was hampering the investigation. He said they had specialists in Asian languages on the scene to assist. Pugel told KOMO that two handguns were found on the scene. In footage obtained from KIRO, members of the Seattle Police Gang Unit could be seen, along with officers from the King County Sheriff's office. They were sealing off the crime scene as helicopters whirred overhead. KIRO also spoke with a neighbor who heard some of the gunshots.

"They hugged at the Rafah border crossing. Cheered in Gaza City. And in Mitzpe Hila, Israel, they gave a hero's welcome for the young soldier who last saw his hometown five years ago. The release of Israeli soldier Gildad Shalit in exchange for the eventual release of 1,027 Palestinians held by Israel unleashed a powerful wave of celebration among Palestinians and Israelis alike. It also raised the ire of some Israelis, who worry the deal would  lead to more violence. In Mitzpe Hila, onlookers waved Israeli flags, danced, cheered and tossed white roses at a convoy carrying the young soldier home. He emerged from a white van and briefly acknowledged the crowd with a wave before uniformed officers hustled him away, apparently into his parents' home. At the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza, masked Hamas gunmen accompanied buses filled with released prisoners to a terminal where they met with friends and relatives for emotional reunions before a mass celebration and parade in Gaza City. Some of them chanted, ""We want another Shalit,"" CNN's Matthew Chance reported. Crowds of Palestinians flooded the streets of Gaza, waving flags and banners to welcome the released prisoners home. They pressed up to buses carrying the prisoners to a rally in Gaza City, reaching out to touch the newly freed as they leaned out windows. People shouted, ""With our blood and with our hearts we sacrifice for you prisoners."" Ahmed Qawasmi was awaiting the release of his son Amer, who was arrested when he was 17 and had been in prison 24 years. ""I am very very happy for the release of my son Amer,"" he said. ""The celebrations and happiness won't be complete until all Palestinian prisoners are free from Israeli prisons."" Nabil Hamouz told CNN he was waiting for the release of his mother Hanan, who has served one year of a 2½-year sentence for trying to stab an Israeli soldier. ""I am very happy and can't wait to hug my mother again,"" he said, weeping. Hamas official Hassan Youssef welcomed the release of some prisoners but said it was not enough. ""We are all shedding two tears: one tear for the release of all of our fighters, and a tear of pain for all of our brothers still in prison,"" he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used strikingly similar language to describe his nation's emotions at the release of Shalit. ""Today we are all united in joy and in pain. ... This is also a hard day; even if the price had been smaller, it would still have been heavy,"" he said. While Israelis are solidly supportive of the deal, they are nearly split on the question of whether the release will harm Israeli security, according to a poll of 500 people conducted by the Dahaf Polling Institute for the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. Gershon Baskin, an Israeli peace activist who helped negotiate the deal, said it will help encourage democratic trends in Palestinian areas. ""It's certainly an emotional day in my life,"" he said. But Arnold Roth, whose daughter died in the 2001 bombing of a Jerusalem pizzeria, called the exchange ""quite catastrophic."" One of the prisoners released Tuesday was a woman who Roth said masterminded the bombing. ""What happened here is that under conditions of extortion, the government of Israel  has done everything it needs to do to bring home a soldier,"" he said. ""But it's emptied its prisons of security prisoners, terrorists, murderers, people who stood trial and who have the most unimaginable crimes on their records. So this is a horrible outcome."" Of course, Palestinian officials don't see it that way, and hope Tuesday's scene will be repeated again and again until all of the estimated 5,000 Palestinians held by Israel are released. Palestinian Prime Mister Mahmoud Abbas told cheering crowds they had ""fought and sacrificed, and you will see the results of your struggle in an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital."" And he said more prisoners would be released. ""We have made an agreement with the Israeli government to release another group of prisoners, and we call on them to keep their promises,"" he said.","In Israeli soldier's hometown, residents wave flags, dance, cheer his return .
In Gaza, thousands cheer the return of  Palestinian prisoners .
Some say the exchange will help the peace process .
Others worry it will lead to more violence ."
"The Republican-led House on Thursday voted to form a select committee to investigate the deadly Benghazi terror attack, elevating its oversight of an issue that has become a partisan flashpoint. Benghazi -- government cover-up or right-wing conspiracy theory? A nearly party line vote of 232-186 established the panel despite investigations by multiple House committees that have reviewed documents, interviewed witnesses and held numerous hearings. The September 2012 armed assault on the U.S. diplomatic compound in eastern Libya killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Democrats were still deciding whether to participate in the committee, arguing its creation was a political ploy to keep the controversy in play during a midterm election year. More will be known about that as early as Friday. House Speaker John Boehner said new questions about the Obama administration's handling of the matter now required the House ""to respond as one institution"" to arrive at the truth. But House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Republicans have exploited the tragedy, adding that the ""nation deserves better than yet another deeply partisan and political review."" Hillary Clinton: No reason for new Benghazi committee . Boehner said the committee would have robust authority and its investigation ""will not be a partisan process."" New information released last week . The Obama administration has come under fire over questions about the level of security before the armed assault, its reaction to it, and its slow-to-evolve public response. In moving ahead with the committee, Boehner said that ""a line was crossed in two places."" First, he said documents unearthed by a conservative watchdog that surfaced last week raised questions about the administration's explanation of events after the attack. He also said the administration defied a congressional subpoena to turn over information. There has been intense controversy over early statements linking the attack to a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States that had sparked demonstrations elsewhere at the time. But it was soon revealed that it was a coordinated terror attack. Republicans allege the administration politicized its response in a presidential election year. The White House has said the new information cited by Boehner was broad-based and not specifically related to Benghazi. Will Democrats participate? The question now centers on whether Democrats will sign on. As of now, they would get five of the 12 seats. But Democrats want more equity. Those issues center on membership as well as subpoenas and the questioning of witnesses. Borger: The biggest mistake Democrats could make on Benghazi . House Republicans are unlikely to bend to Democratic demands on the details of the committee, a GOP source familiar with the matter told CNN. But when pressed about whether Republicans would make changes to give Democrats more power in the investigation, Boehner would only say that ""there are further conversations continuing on that issue."" Those talks were said to be intense. In addition to a possible boycott, CNN has learned that Democrats also are discussing another option -- minimal participation -- something short of an all-out boycott and less than the full contingent of Democrats. According to a Democratic leadership aide, this option would ""make clear they're protesting, but also have full member participation to ensure that there are Democrats in the room to hold Republicans accountable for their behavior on the committee. Meeting on strategy . On Thursday, many House Democrats attended a weekly meeting to go over strategy for floor action on the issue. But Pelosi and other top Democrats were still weighing the pros and cons from their rank and file on the issue of participation. One aide told CNN that Democrats recognized they were unlikely to get changes they outlined in a letter to Boehner. But the aide said that ""the calculus on this is being weighed -- do we participate in a Darrell Issa-like committee or worse, or is it worth having someone in the room for it?"" Issa is chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which has taken a leading role in the GOP-led investigation of Benghazi. His effort has been sharply criticized by Democrats. Rep. Steve Israel, who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is in charge of electing Democrats to the House this November, is arguing privately it would be a mistake to participate. He cited numerous reasons, including fear that independent voters fed up with Washington bickering would see Democrats as part of the problem. Fundraising off Benghazi . Separately, the controversy grew more intense this week over revelations that Republicans were using it for political fund-raising. Democrats contend that just underscores their belief that the select committee was politically driven. Boehner punted on the fund-raising question on Thursday, refusing to endorse or dismiss it. Despite multiple questions about whether it is right for Republicans to use the tragedy to raise political cash, all Boehner would say repeatedly is ""our focus is on getting the truth for the American people and these four families."" Boehner already appointed South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former prosecutor, to head the select committee. He said he would release the names of other Republican members in the near future. A GOP aide told CNN he expected the names to be released on Friday. Opinion: A guide to GOP's Benghazi obsession .","House votes almost entirely on party lines to establish the panel .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Department of Homeland Security will never monitor ideology or political beliefs, the head of the agency said Wednesday, responding to criticism of a recent report on right-wing extremist groups. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says the U.S. will never monitor ideology or political beliefs. ""Let me be very clear: We monitor the risks of violent extremism taking root here in the United States,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a written statement. ""We don't have the luxury of focusing our efforts on one group; we must protect the country from terrorism whether foreign or homegrown and regardless of the ideology that motivates its violence."" The report, ""Right-wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,"" said right-wing extremist groups may be using the recession and the election of the nation's first African-American president to recruit members. The report, which was prepared in coordination with the FBI, was published last week. It was distributed to federal, state and local law enforcement officials. Mainstream media picked up the story after it was reported by conservative bloggers.  Watch more on the DHS assessment » . Though the nine-page report said it had ""no specific information that domestic right-wing terrorists are currently planning acts of violence,"" it said real-estate foreclosures, unemployment and tight credit ""could create a fertile recruiting environment for right-wing extremists and even result in confrontations between such groups and government authorities similar to those in the past."" The report compared the current climate with that of the 1990s, saying a recession, criticism over outsourcing of jobs and a perceived threat to U.S. power at that time fueled a resurgence of right-wing extremism. However, it said, ""Despite similarities to the climate of the 1990s, the threat posed by lone wolves and small terrorist cells is more pronounced than in past years."" It warned that the groups may use proposed restrictions on firearms and the debate on immigration as recruiting tools, and said the groups may try to reach out to veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""The willingness of a small percentage of military personnel to join extremist groups during the 1990s because they were disgruntled, disillusioned or suffering from the psychological effects of war is being replicated today,"" the report said. It noted that Timothy McVeigh, the bomber of the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, was a military veteran. Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh decried the report on Tuesday, saying, ""There is not one instance they can cite as evidence where any of these right-wing groups have done anything,"" according to a transcript of his remarks on his Web site. ""You have a report from Janet Napolitano and Barack Obama, Department of Homeland Security portraying standard, ordinary, everyday conservatives as posing a bigger threat to this country than al Qaeda terrorists or genuine enemies of this country like Kim Jong Il,"" he said, referring to the leader of North Korea. Michael Savage, another conservative commentator, also criticized the report. ""What does Big Sis say these right-wingers are concerned about?"" he wrote on his Web site, referring to Napolitano. ""Illegal aliens, the increasing power of the federal government, gun grabs, abortion and the loss of U.S. national sovereignty. In other words, anyone who is worried about preserving our borders, language and culture is on Big Sis' watch list."" In her Wednesday statement, Napolitano said the agency is on ""the lookout for criminal and terrorist activity but we do not -- nor will we ever -- monitor ideology or political beliefs."" She said she was briefed on the general topic, which ""struck a nerve as someone personally involved in the Timothy McVeigh prosecution."" Napolitano said she intends to meet with American Legion National Commander David K. Rehbein, who sent her a letter Monday stating his concern about the report. ""Timothy McVeigh was only one of more than 42 million veterans who have worn this nation's uniform during wartime,"" he wrote. ""To continue to use McVeigh as an example of the stereotypical 'disgruntled military veteran' is as unfair as using Osama bin Laden as the sole example of Islam."" He added, ""I think it is important for all of us to remember that Americans are not the enemy. The terrorists are."" Napolitano said in her statement that she will tell Rehbein that the Department of Homeland Security honors veterans and employs thousands, including Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute. The Obama administration in January issued a warning about left-wing extremists. Both reports were initiated during the administration of President George W. Bush. CNN's Jeanne Meserve contributed to this story.","Homeland secretary: U.S. will not monitor ideology, political beliefs .

"Washington (CNN) -- Miami International Airport was shut down for several hours Friday after screeners spotted a canister inside the luggage of a scientist that eventually turned out to be ""a legitimate experiment."" Concern about the incident increased greatly overnight when  authorities learned that the 70-year-old scientist once spent time in  prison nearly a decade ago for illegally shipping vials of deadly  bubonic plague bacteria. After a round of overnight questioning, the man was told by the FBI he was free to go. CNN is not naming the scientist, a U.S. citizen, because he was not charged in this  incident. The normally bustling airport was closed for more than seven hours when screeners spotted a  metal canister in the man's luggage that ""greatly resembled a pipe bomb,"" a  U.S. government official said. The airport reopened early Friday. Authorities say the man cooperated fully, telling investigators the canister was used for medical testing. Authorities say the device was not explosive. When authorities opened the device, they found a secondary container within.  Investigators said the container is used to transport dead bacteria  samples. ""The container was a legitimate experiment,"" a U.S. government source told CNN. The man's criminal history helps explain why authorities shut down much of the airport late Thursday, and why first responders in hazardous materials suits were dispatched to the scene. Officials gave conflicting accounts of the man's travel arrangements, with one early report saying he arrived from Brazil, while later reports said the bag originated in Saudi Arabia, and traveled via London, England to Miami, Florida and that its final destination was Dominica via San Juan, Puerto Rico. When Transportation Security Administration screeners found the device, they  were examining the bag because it was to be placed on a connecting flight. Most of the airport was closed for hours as a bomb squad team dealt with the canister. All concourses, except for Concourse J, were closed before the situation was resolved, police said. Concourses E and F were evacuated at 9:30 p.m. ET Thursday after the item was found, said Greg Chin, a Miami-Dade Aviation Department spokesman. Authorities rerouted arriving flights to other parts of the airport. Investigators from Miami-Dade Police, the Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security responded, the Transportation Security Administration said in a statement. Airport roads were also closed ""to ensure public safety,"" the statement said. Debbie Casanova was one of many people caught in the traffic jam outside the terminals during the incident. Casanova said she waited for her husband to come out of the airport for more than an hour and the wait continued even after she picked him up. ""We have been siting here for two hours,"" said Casanova, as she sat in her car with her husband, Roberto. ""It is frustrating, but it is better to know everybody is safe.""

"Hillary Clinton on Tuesday weaved together the national outcry over a recent report detailing U.S. torture abroad and the nationwide protests against recent police killings of unarmed black men. The former secretary of state said the U.S. should reaffirm a ban on torture in ""both policy and law"" and suggested that Congress pass legislation to make the U.S. opposition to torture absolutely clear after a scathing Senate committee report recounting years of torture of terror suspects at the hands of the CIA. ""Today we can say again, in a loud and clear voice, the United States should never condone or practice torture anywhere in the world, not under any future administration or in any future conflict,"" said Clinton, who is expected to launch a 2016 presidential bid. ""If that requires new legislation, then Congress should work with President Obama to quickly enact it, and it should not be an issue of partisan politics."" Accepting a human rights award from the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, Clinton homed in on the importance of putting American values first when it comes to the criminal justice system and in the fight against terrorism. ""It is possible to keep us safe from terrorism and reduce crime and violence without relying on torture abroad or unnecessary force or excessive incarceration at home,"" she said. ""There's no doubt that at home and abroad, America is at our best when our actions match our values."" Bush era haunts Obama . Clinton invoked the protesters who have mobilized in major U.S. cities to protest the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York, both black men who were unarmed when they were killed by white police officers. ""We can stand up together and say, 'Yes, black lives matter,' "" she said, referring to the rallying cry of demonstrators around the country. Clinton called attention to inequalities in the U.S. between minority groups and whites, noting the ""cruel reality"" that African-American and Hispanic men are much more likely to be searched by police officers, jailed and shot by police officers than white men. She said the country can work to restore trust in the criminal justice system and a balance between rights and security by remembering the police officers who do their jobs right. ""We know that there are so many police officers every day inspiring trust and confidence rather than fear and frustration, honorably doing their duty, putting their lives on the line to save lives, not take them,"" she said. Clinton also drew on Kennedy, the one-time presidential candidate, former U.S. attorney general and civil rights champion, saying that he would call attention to the gap between American ideals and the reality throughout American history. It's time to ""narrow the gap between our ideals and our reality,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The current round of fighting between Hamas and Israel will eventually stop. When it does, grieving and exhausted Israelis and Palestinians will still be neighbors. Their differences will remain. The aftershocks of this war will reverberate not just in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel, but also in the streets of Cairo and Riyadh, in the cafes and living rooms of Paris, in the foreign ministries of Arab countries and in the meetings rooms of the U.S. State Department. This war has exposed damaged nerves, deep prejudices and flawed policies. Here are five places where we will see the impact after the fighting stops. Israel . As Israelis were taking cover from Hamas rockets and the Gaza-based Islamist group announced it was also targeting planes flying in and out of Israel's main airport, a television anchor in Lebanon offered a most unhelpful suggestion. Iran, she said, should give nuclear weapons to Hamas to fight Israel. Meanwhile, Iran's Supreme Leader reiterated his wish to see Israel wiped away. These messages remind Israelis of the seriousness of their situation. Hamas has no interest in a two-state solution. It is committed to obliterating Israel. Israelis do have disagreements regarding settlements and withdrawal from the West Bank. But when it comes to Hamas, there is no question. The Hamas charter reads: ""Our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious."" As the writer David Grossman put it, leftist Israelis now see that ""the right wing's fears are not mere paranoia,"" and the right will see that there are limits to the use of force. This fight will erode the position of the extreme left and the extreme right in Israel, giving a boost to pragmatic advocates of security. The debate will revive calls to find other options and strengthen more moderate forces among Palestinians who have lost ground to Hamas. The imperative to find a new way forward with moderate Palestinians will re-emerge after frayed nerves cool. But an old obstacle has grown: Israelis' greatest fear is a Palestinian state falling to extremists, as Gaza did to Hamas, receiving weapons from Iran and others. There is no way Israelis will now accept an armed Palestinian state within tunneling distance of its major cities, especially if Hamas remains a dangerous player. Palestine . Hamas' bravado and its killing of Israelis may give a popularity boost to the group. But Palestinians are pondering Hamas's tactics. They will blame primarily Israel, no question, but they will take a look at the Hamas strategy that resulted in so much death and destruction. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was one of the first to say it publicly. When Israel was warning Hamas to stop the rocket fire that triggered a ground assault, Abbas sounded exasperated. ""What are you trying to achieve launching rockets?"" he asked Hamas, adding, ""We prefer to fight with wisdom."" With Hamas fighters hidden in tunnels, drawing Israeli fire to civilian areas, no matter how much you hate your enemy, is a tactic that warrants examination if not outright condemnation. In a stark shift from previous conflicts, criticism of Hamas was widespread in Arab media. Egyptian journalists, in particular, fulminated against Hamas. Europe . The suffering of the Palestinian population of Gaza has been a heartbreaking aspect of this conflict, and it's hardly surprising that it spurred protests, particularly in cities with large Muslim populations. But what happened in a number of European cities in France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and elsewhere was something that goes far beyond a show of sympathy for the victims of war or a rejection of Israel's tactics. Europe saw some of the ugliest eruptions of blatant anti-Semitism since the 1940s. Critics of Israel often claim that Israel unfairly hides from critics by charging anti-Semitism, but cries of ""death to the Jews,"" ""slit the Jews throats,"" or ""Jews to the gas chambers"" along with the smashing and torching of Jewish-owned shops and attacks on synagogues, have pulled back the cover, revealing anti-Jewish sentiment that still runs deep, and in most cases remains unspoken in polite circles. We will find out how seriously European leaders address the matter now that we have found what lay hidden behind the curtain of civil discourse. Middle East . The Israel-Hamas war has highlighted the emerging ideological and political alliances of a new Middle East. Turkey and Qatar have emerged as the champions of Hamas. Their support for the Muslim Brotherhood during the Arab Spring became increasingly bold. Now the two countries have become the defenders of Islamist groups across the region, drawing the ire of other Arab governments. Advocating for Islamists in Gaza is particularly beneficial to their political objectives, because the Palestinian cause draws popular support. That's why Egypt's decision to stand back is so remarkable. Egypt under its new government has taken a firm stance against Hamas and increasingly clashes with its supporters, particularly with Turkey. These political alliances complicate matters for the Washington. United States . The fighting in Gaza, with the dramatic pictures of Palestinians civilian deaths and thousands of rockets fired by Hamas towards Israeli civilians, has caused a diplomatic conundrum for Washington. Israel is America's foremost ally in the region. But President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have disagreements. Instead of taking a firm stance on Israel's side, the United States has engaged in diplomacy with Qatar, which supports Israel's deadliest enemies, and Turkey, whose leaders have slandered and smeared Israel. Details of the diplomatic process, which amazingly excluded Palestinian moderates, have caused consternation in Israel, fury in Palestinian circles and disdain in Egypt. When the cease-fire comes, the United States should review how it balances allies and their antagonists in times of crisis, because even after the shooting stops, this conflict is far from over.","Violence continues as Israel and Hamas militants fight in Gaza .

"The United States dismissed a report that an agreement had been reached between Iran and world powers to begin implementing a deal that requires Tehran to limit its nuclear program. The announcement followed a report in state-run Iranian media that a deal had been reached in negotiations between Tehran and the six world powers, including the United States, to begin implementing the agreement in late January, . ""We've made progress in our discussions, and the teams have taken a few outstanding points back to capitals,"" State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf. ""The two sides expect to finalize the implementation plan soon."" A senior administration official characterized the talks as ongoing. ""We're getting close but just not quite there yet,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. A senior Iranian negotiator, Hamid Baeidinejad, told Press TV that an agreement had been reached following two days of talks in Geneva between Iran and the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany. The two sides managed to reach an understanding on the implementation of the agreement and now, their views and interpretations (of the Geneva deal) are the same,"" Baeidinejad told Iranian state-run Press TV. The nuclear deal struck in November between the world powers, collectively known as the P5+1, and Iran calls for Tehran to limit its nuclear activities in return for a relaxation of sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy. The deal has been widely hailed as a successful interim measure to stave off an unwanted conflict over Tehran's illicit nuclear program. But after initially celebrating a diplomatic success, Iran has reportedly lashed out at the United States for releasing a modified version of the agreement to the American people that does not reflect its interpretation. Just last week, Iranian lawmakers drafted a bill that would force the government to enrich uranium up to 60% if new sanctions are imposed, state media reported Wednesday. The move came less than a week after bipartisan legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate that would authorize new economic sanctions on Iran if it breaches an interim agreement to limit its nuclear program or fails to strike a final accord terminating those ambitions.. The United States and other western powers believe Iran is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment. But Tehran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful.","""We're getting close but just not quite there yet,"" a U.S. administration official says .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The U.S. military closed its detention facility in southern Iraq on Thursday after a plane carried the last remaining prisoners to another facility in Baghdad. Iraqi detainees walk around Camp Bucca detention centre on May 20, 2008 . The United States has been releasing detainees or transferring custody to the Iraqi government, a goal spelled out in the bilateral security agreement negotiated last year between the two nations. Since February, the Americans have released about 750 detainees from its detention facilities and transferred 200 more to Iraqi authorities each month, the military said. Camp Bucca, in the southern port city of Basra, was one of three prisons operated by U.S.-led forces in Iraq. The other two are Camp Cropper, adjacent to the Baghdad airport, and Camp Taji, just north of the capital. Both camps are scheduled to be handed over to the Iraqis next year. The last 180 detainees from Bucca were airlifted by military transport early Thursday morning to one of those two other facilities. A total of 8,305 detainees still remain in U.S. custody, about half the number at the start of the year. ""I'm pleased to say the Camp Bucca detention facility is now closed,"" said Brig. Gen. David Quantock, the commander of the task force handling the detainee releases and transfers.","U.S. miliary closes Camp Bucca, a detention center in southern Iraq .

"A week of demonstrations in Venezuela. Three people shot dead; dozens wounded; dozens more arrested and imprisoned. Pro-regime thugs intimidate protesting high school and college students. The question is being asked: Is Chavismo finally cracking in Venezuela? Hugo Chavez died of cancer nearly a year ago, and the question hanging over Venezuela is how long his strange regime can live after him. A country with a population smaller than Canada's has more murders than the United States. Inflation exceeds 56%. Goods from toilet paper to sacramental wine have vanished from shops.  A regime that calls itself ""socialist"" has massively enriched the former president's family and friends. Street lights dim at night because a country with some of the world's largest energy reserves cannot provide enough electricity. The Chavez regime has held power with four principal tools, all but one of which is gone or going. The first tool of power was the late president's own mesmerizing personality. Venezuela has a bitter national history, and nobody has ever better voiced the resentments and yearnings of its subordinated classes and castes than Hugo Chavez. In a nation whose elite historically looked European, Chavez's face proclaimed his descent from indigenous people and African slaves. He joked, he raged, he bestowed favors on the barrios and made enemies of the traditional upper classes. By contrast, the outstanding personal quality of Chavez's chosen successor, Nicolas Maduro, was his cringing deference to the leader who elevated him from a bus driver's seat to the top jobs in government. Venezuela expels three U.S. diplomatic officials . The second Chavez tool of power was the shrewd deployment of the nation's oil wealth to buy support from favored constituencies. Support Chavez, and you might get a free house stocked with appliances, a government job or at least a new playground. Chavez held the price of gasoline to pennies per gallon and offered subsidized rice and beans in government-owned shops. Meanwhile, he withdrew police protection from the wealthier neighborhoods that despised him, deploying criminal violence as a de facto tool of political repression. Now, however, Venezuela is running out of cash to pay for these support-buying schemes. Industries are shuttering because they cannot obtain foreign currency to buy crucial parts. Interest rates on Venezuelan debt have jumped past 15%.  The economy, which managed 1% growth in 2013, is now shrinking  as economic activity other than oil and gas production grinds to a stop. Chavez's third tool of power was control of the media. Independent television stations were eliminated. Newsprint shortages and other pressures were manipulated to force the sale of independent print media to government supporters.  But it's difficult to cut populations off from information in the modern age, especially for a ramshackle, technically incompetent regime like Venezuela under Chavismo. Venezuela is not China nor even Putin's Russia. The people who understand how the Internet works overwhelmingly oppose the government. The fourth and last tool of power was outright repression. Chavez himself always used this tool sparingly. He preferred economic reprisals against his opponents to violence. He drove them into exile rather than send them to camps. He politicized the army and police, but he hesitated to use them, perhaps because he did not in the end fully trust them. When I visited Venezuela in 2010, everybody was talking about elite Cuban paramilitary police units that Chavez had supposedly borrowed from Fidel Castro. But change is coming to Cuba too, and if the units ever existed, they certainly have not been visible in the past's weeks clashes. Instead, Maduro has relied on local thugs. Perhaps the Syrian example inspires Maduro to hope that he can hang on if his forces just kill enough people. But Venezuela is located in a very different neighborhood, close not only to the United States but also to democracies in Colombia and Brazil that take a dim view of murderous dictatorship. (Maduro has said that the opposition is mounting a ""developing coup"" and has issued an arrest warrant on conspiracy and murder charges against an opposition leader; the opposition leader's party blames the government for the violence.) Chavez had an instinctive awareness that he could go so far but not too far. Whether Chavez's successor shares that awareness of limits, those limits still exist -- and without crossing them, Chavez's regime may have run out of the resources it needs to survive. As the Castro regime in Cuba has demonstrated, a moribund authoritarian system can take a long time dying. But the Castro brothers were serious about hanging on to power. Chavismo was serious about nothing.","David Frum says recent protests highlight weakness of Venezuela regime .

"Google Glass's vision for its future is coming into focus. On Tuesday, Google announced it will add Google Glass options for prescription glasses, its most requested feature since it launched the face-mounted computers last year. The move is the latest attempt by Google to make the beta version of its connected eyewear more fashionable and consumer friendly before it releases the product to the broader public toward the end of 2014. The prescription lenses will be available in a set of newly designed, fashion-conscious frames that will cost $225 each. This new Titanium line will include four frame shapes called curve, thin, split and bold. The outside of the Titanium frames is gray, but there are four options for subtle accent colors inside the frames. Google is also adding three options for sunglasses that will cost $150 each. The actual Glass hardware, which can shoot video and projects Internet content such as e-mails, walking directions and sports scores onto a tiny screen above the wearer's right eye, is staying the same for now. It was last updated in October, when the team made sure the design was modular and could attach to the right side of the Titanium glass frames. You still can't quickly pop Google Glass off one frame and onto another, because the process requires undoing a small screw. While the task is easy enough, the system is not meant for frequent frame changes. Google is betting that people will be so comfortable wearing Google Glass that they won't have to choose between prescription glasses and Google Glass. ""We're going to reach some day, hopefully it will be soon, where people will wonder 'why would I want traditional glasses? They don't do X, Y or Z,' "" said Google Glass Product Director Steve Lee. Fusing Google Glass with prescription lenses could lead to its own set of problems, however, because wearers can't take them off without limiting their vision, and the Internet-enabled glasses aren't welcome everywhere. Earlier this month, an Ohio man was questioned by local and federal law enforcement for wearing his Google Glass during a movie. The authorities suspected he was secretly recording the film until he explained the eyewear was turned off and connected to a pair of prescription frames. (He had purchased the custom frames for $600 through a third party.) Driving while wearing Glass is also a thorny issue in many states, including California, where a woman was ticketed last year for wearing the device while behind the wheel. The citation was dismissed in court, but since many people need their prescription glasses to drive, there could be an uptick in the number of motorists sporting Google Glass. Google is confident these types of issues will be resolved as Glass becomes more common place and people learn to recognize when the device is turned on or off. Currently there is no indicator light but when the device is on, other people can see a faint light on the Glass screen. The company hopes venues and states hostile to Glass might even embrace it down the road. For example, there's a Glass app called Drive Safe Google Glass that can wake drivers up if it detects they are falling asleep. That might appeal to law enforcement. Theaters could embrace the technology as a way to deliver close captioning for movies to certain audience members. ""I think you need to give the technology a chance to breathe and evolve,"" said Google Glass spokesperson Chris Dale. Prescription glasses can be pricey without insurance, so Google has struck a deal with vision benefits company Vision Service Plan, commonly known as VSP, to add coverage for wearers of the new specs. Insurance reimbursements will extend only to the frames and prescription lenses and can't be used toward the Glass device itself, which still costs $1,500. The new frames were designed in-house by Google employees on the Glass team, despite earlier rumors of a possible partnership with hip eyewear retailer Warby Parker. Going forward, the company does hope to work with third-party eyewear companies so partners can create their own Google Glass compatible products. Even with the regular-looking new frames, someone wearing Google Glass still stands out. In the future, it might be possible to shrink the hardware down so that it's more subtle, but Google doesn't necessarily think that's what all users will want. More modular designs and partnerships with third parties could expand the options so that a Glass wearer could decide between wearing an obvious look or going undetected. ""Sometimes I want to go out and I want to be seen, I want people to talk to me about Glass. I've actually found glass to be the most social experience ever,"" said Lee. ""But other times I just want to go about my business, stay low key."" Fighting fires with the help of Google Glass .

"The clock is ticking on an interim nuclear deal with Iran, as well as efforts in Congress to pass new sanctions for greater leverage in global negotiations on a comprehensive accord. Sunday's announcement that a six-month interim agreement formally begins on January 20 means that Iran must dismantle or freeze some of its nuclear program and open it to more international inspections in return for limited relief from crippling international sanctions. Assuming all goes as planned, further negotiations between Iran and the United States, France, Russia, China, Great Britain and Germany will seek a broader agreement intended to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, pro-Israel members of Congress are seeking additional sanctions against Iran that would take effect if the talks break down. Israel considers Iran's potential nuclear capability an existential threat, and has made clear it would attack militarily if it believed Tehran could develop such weapons of mass destruction. The question is whether the steps Iran is taking under the interim deal will blunt or bolster the congressional push for more sanctions. President Barack Obama warns that approving new sanctions legislation now would undermine the talks, and he has promised to veto such a measure if it came to his desk. ""Now is not time for new sanctions,"" Obama told reporters on Monday. He warned the continuing negotiations with Iran would be ""difficult"" and ""challenging,"" adding that ""ultimately this is how diplomacy should work."" A bipartisan proposal that would impose new U.S. sanctions -- but put off implementing them to allow time for negotiations to continue -- has the support of 59 Senators so far, a senior Senate aide told CNN last week. According to the aide, the informal count for the measure introduced by Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois surpasses 75 votes  -- more than enough for the Democratic-led Senate to override the promised presidential veto. It takes a two-thirds majority of both the House and Senate to approve a law over a president's objection. The GOP-led House would have a much easier time of reaching that threshold. The Obama administration argues the six-month interim deal includes sufficient safeguards in the form of new compliance verification by the U.N. nuclear energy watchdog -- the International Atomic Energy Agency -- to make further sanctions unnecessary at this time. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that beginning the interim agreement on January 20 means that ""for the first time in almost a decade, Iran's nuclear program will not be able to advance and parts of it will be rolled back."" Iranian officials also confirmed the start date, state media reported. As part of the accord, Iran has agreed to start eliminating its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium, to dismantle some infrastructure that makes higher-level uranium enrichment possible, and not to start up additional centrifuges. Representatives of the IAEA also will monitor Iran's nuclear facilities and make sure the country is taking the required steps as part of the deal. In exchange, Iran will get sanctions relief over the six-month period of the interim deal totaling about $7 billion, including access to $4.2 billion in frozen assets. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday that the first IAEA envoys to visit Tehran under the interim agreement would arrive on January 18, according to a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Iranian lawmakers have threatened to boost uranium enrichment levels if the United States imposes more sanctions. A deputy foreign minister, Majid Ravanchi, told CNN on Sunday that the enactment of additional sanctions from the U.S. Senate would ""ruin the entire agreement."" It was not immediately clear if Ravanchi's use of the word ""enactment"" meant that new sanctions would have to become law or merely receive Senate approval. There was immediate political fallout from the announcement that the interim deal was to take effect. ""I'm concerned that this agreement takes us down that path where sanctions pressure is relieved, but Iran maintains its ability to produce a nuclear weapon,"" said Republican Rep. Ed Royce of California, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Given these stakes, it's regrettable that the President does not want to work with Congress to bolster his negotiating hand with additional sanctions, which would go into effect should Iran fail to meet its commitments."" However, Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas argued Monday that the talks must be allowed to continue. ""War is the true alternative offered by those here who would interfere or limit these negotiations,"" Doggett said of supporters for new sanctions. ""The Iranians are well aware that this Congress can act almost instantly to add even more stringent sanctions if they waver from diplomacy,"" he said. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Monday that Iran's willingness to proceed with the interim agreement and its more stringent verification and controls showed the diplomatic pressure was working. ""The fact that we are now at the implementation stage of the Joint Plan of Action demonstrates that, at the very least, testing whether or not Iran is serious is the right thing to do,"" Carney said. A senior administration official warned Sunday that a new sanctions bill now would derail the current talks and could ""undermine the sanctions regime that we have built so meticulously over the course of the last several years."" ""If the talks are derailed by new U.S. unilateral sanctions, Iran would take that case to the international community and seek to create divisions in the international community,"" the official said on condition of not being identified. The interim agreement struck in November was considered a successful first step to prevent a possible conflict over Iran's nuclear ambitions. After it was announced last year, three more rounds of meetings were required to hammer out details for implementing it, European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton said in a statement on Sunday. Another Iranian deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, said Sunday that his country would stop 20% uranium enrichment at that time, Iran's state-run news agency reported. ""There's $4.2 billion of Iran's oil income which will be released and from the other side, the conversion of 20% enriched material to oxide or diluting it (will) be carried out,"" Araqchi said. Kerry warned the upcoming negotiations on a final deal would be ""very difficult, but they are the best chance we have to be able to resolve this critical national security issue peacefully and durably.""","President Obama says ""now is not the time for new sanctions""

"Three days of intensive talks about Iran's nuclear program concluded early Sunday without an agreement, though key players insisted they believed the process is moving in the right direction. ""A lot of concrete progress has been achieved, but some differences remain,"" European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif echoed that sentiment, saying ""hopefully we will be able to reach an agreement when we meet again."" ""I think we are all on the same wavelength, and that's important,"" Zarif said. ""And that gives us the impetus to go forward."" The inclusion of top diplomats such as Zarif, Ashton and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry left some thinking that this latest meeting could lead to a breakthrough to satisfy the international community's desire that Iran not develop a nuclear weapon and, with that, a relaxation of crippling sanctions on the Middle Eastern nation. That didn't prove to be the case this time, though the parties -- including Zarif and Ashton -- will meet again November 20. Both Ashton and Zarif fielded questions posited on the assumption France blocked a resolution this time around. But neither singled out any one party, with the Iranian foreign minister saying differences among the countries are only ""natural ... when we start dealing with the detail."" ""We had a very good three days, a very productive three days,"" Zarif said. ""And it's something that we can build on."" Kerry also voiced optimism, saying, ""I can tell you, without any exaggeration, we not only narrowed differences but we made significant progress. ...There's no question in my mind that we are closer now."" At the same, the top U.S. diplomat cautioned against jumping into any agreement that everyone is not comfortable with -- especially given the complicated, technical details to deal with and the need to ""build confidence between countries that have really been at odds with each other for a long time now."" ""Diplomacy takes time, and all the parties here need time to fully consider the issues,"" Kerry said. Israel-Palestinian relations hit new snags as Kerry visits Jerusalem . Iranian president: West shouldn't miss 'unique opportunity' It is widely believed that Iran harbors aspirations to produce nuclear weapons. Repeated findings by U.N. weapons inspectors indicate that the country appeared to be conducting nuclear weapons research. Iran has always maintained that its nuclear program is for purely peaceful purposes. Even though Iran has denied working toward nuclear weapons, it has said it will not submit to any plan that would totally eliminate its nuclear program. For years, international leaders have been fearful of the instability a nuclear-armed Iran could bring to the Middle East. Those fears, for example, include the possibility of a pre-emptive Israeli strike that could spark a broader conflict. In the past, Iran has threatened Israel with military attack. Iran has been under crippling U.N. sanctions related to its nuclear program since 2006, and those sanctions have hobbled the nation's economy. The United States first sanctioned Iran over its nuclear program in 2000. The relatively sudden progress in recent meetings -- after years of stalemate -- follows a slight thaw in relations between Iran and the West under the newly elected President Hassan Rouhani. Rouhani, himself, weighed in Saturday from afar, taking to Twitter to say ""the West should not miss this unique opportunity."" Saying the Iranian delegation was participating in Geneva ""with strong will & determination,"" Rouhani tweeted that ""one of the slogans the Iranian nation has embraced is that of 'constructive interaction with the world.'"" The Iranian president also spoke at a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, contending that resolving the nuclear issue will ""help restore stability and tranquility to the entire region."" ""The negotiating parties should bear in their mind that this opportunity was created following recent presidential election in Iran as the Iranian peopled called for establishing a constructive interaction with the world,"" Rouhani said, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Iran's nuclear capabilities . Israel: 'Bad deal' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is not involved in the talks, warned that an agreement is ""the deal of a century for Iran"" but a ""very dangerous and bad deal for peace."" ""It's a very bad deal,"" he said. ""Iran is not required to take apart even one centrifuge. But the international community is relieving sanctions on Iran for the first time after many years. Iran gets everything that it wanted at this stage and pays nothing."" A senior Israeli government official says Israel backs a diplomatic solution that would dismantle Iran's military nuclear program, ""dismantling all the centrifuges, the removal of the enriched uranium and the closure of the heavy water reactor."" If Iran wants nuclear power ""for civilian purposes, as it claims, it has no need for centrifuges and heavy water. These are only required to produce nuclear weapons. Like 17 other countries in the world (e.g. Canada and Indonesia), she can do this without a centrifuge and without a heavy water reactor,"" the Israeli official said. A heavy water reactor at Arak, which weapons experts warn could be used to process weapons-grade plutonium, is under construction and could be activated early next year. Once the reactor is activated, it could be dangerous to incapacitate. Responding to Netanyahu's remarks, British Foreign Secretary William Hague asked for trust and understanding. ""We haven't done the deal yet. We haven't made this deal yet. So I think everybody will have to comment on it if and when we reach a successful conclusion, and make their judgment about it then. So I'd ask everyone to be patient and to wait for us to arrive at that conclusion if we can."" Hague stressed that any agreement would ""require some flexibility on all sides."" He is cautiously optimistic, citing the mood among diplomats. ""The atmosphere of these negotiations, as others have told you before, is completely different from the atmosphere of a few months ago. Clearly, dealing with these ministers from Iran is a different experience from the recent past. So a lot of progress has been made, but it's too early to say that we will reach a successful conclusion today,"" Hague said. Graham: New sanctions on Iran needed . U.S. officials outline possible deal . Two senior U.S. administration officials said that, under the potential deal, Iran would agree: . • to stop enriching nuclear fuel to 20% purity. • to render unusable most of its existing stockpile of such fuel. • not to use advanced IR-2 centrifuges, which can enrich nuclear fuel five times faster than older centrifuges. • not to activate a plutonium reactor at Arak. In turn, the P5+1 would agree: . • to unfreeze some Iranian assets held in banks overseas. • to consider easing sanctions banning trade in gold, precious metals and petrochemicals. Other sweeteners were also under consideration, they said. One of the officials said the deal is designed to ""stop Iran's progress by stopping the shortening of time by which they could build a nuclear weapon"" while providing temporary, reversible sanctions relief to Iran. That official cautioned that the deal is not done but said it could happen if the Iranians agree to the P5+1's demands. The P5+1 or EU3+3 -- comprises the United States, France, Britain, Russia, China and Germany .","U.S. secretary of state says ""diplomacy takes time""

"For the first time since the 2008 presidential race, Hillary Clinton made a foray back into the thorny world of campaign politics on Saturday, appearing at a rally for Terry McAuliffe, the longtime Clinton confidante now running for governor of Virginia. About 500 people showed up to the historic State Theatre in Falls Church, a suburb of Washington, D.C. to witness Clinton's smiling re-emergence on the political scene, showering her with applause when she made even the slightest allusion to running for office again. What did we learn about her future plans as she considers a repeat bid for the White House in 2016? Not much at all, actually. But here are three important takeaways from Clinton's first big political speech since leaving the State Department earlier this year: . She was relaxed . Never a dynamic speaker on the stump in 2008, Clinton was instead relaxed, confident and authoritative on Saturday. It's not hard to see why. This was a supremely low-risk event for Clinton -- as perfect a re-entry into national politics as she could have asked for. Barring some kind of wacky collapse in the final three weeks of the race, McAuliffe is generally expected to defeat his Republican opponent Ken Cuccinelli, though some Democrats here expect the winning margin to be a few points smaller than the eight-point lead he holds in the polls, given the usual GOP turnout edge in an off-year. The former secretary of state has a close personal friendship with McAuliffe, a longtime fundraiser, poker buddy, cheerleader, political fixer and all-purpose confidant for the Clintons. The event's frame -- it was billed as a ""Women For Terry"" rally -- was right in Clinton's strike zone, giving her a chance to talk about politics in terms she feels most comfortable. ""The whole country is watching to see if the rights of women and girls will be respected, especially over our own bodies and our health care,"" she said of the Virginia race, alluding to Cuccinelli's efforts as a state legislator and attorney general to curb access to abortion. Add it all up, and Clinton was completely at ease on Saturday, campaigning in front a fawning audience in the Washington suburbs, talking about women's issues and propping up one of her longtime pals. ""I thought hard about what I wanted to say to Virginians today,"" she said. ""I've been out of politics for a few years now. And I've had a chance to think a lot about what makes our country so great. What kind of leadership is required to keep it great."" How long can Hillary Clinton wait? She wasn't afraid to jab Republicans, however gently . Clinton stayed mostly positive, but she didn't shy away from taking a few shots at Republicans, albeit not by name. Talking about the political gridlock on Capitol Hill that led to a 16-day government shutdown this month, she said that ""we have seen examples of the wrong kind of leadership"" in recent days, an unmistakable poke at House Republicans. ""Politicians choose scorched-earth over common ground,"" she continued. ""They operate in what I called the evidence-free-zone, with ideology trumping everything else,"" she said, before listing the consequences of the shutdown, such as furloughed workers and ""children thrown out of Head Start."" Clinton also made sure to highlight Republican efforts to enforce stricter abortion regulations in Virginia. McAuliffe, she said, would ""stand up against attempts to restrict women's health choices."" Rounding out her speech, Clinton alluded to Alexis de Tocqueville, the French writer who described Americans as having ""habits of the heart"" when he traveled to the U.S. nearly 200 years ago. But Clinton warned that such a spirit is under threat. ""We cannot let those who do not believe in America's progress hijack this great experiment, and substitute for the habits of the heart suspicion, hatred, anger, anxiety. That's not as a people who we are."" Clinton on possible presidency: 'I'm realistic' She executed the McAuliffe game plan . As much as Clinton was the story here, time and again she served as a character witness for McAuliffe, whom Republicans have relentlessly attacked as a carnival barker and Washington insider. ""I've seen the values that he was raised with,"" Clinton said of McAuliffe, standing next to her on stage at the State Theatre, along with his wife Dorothy. ""He grew up in a middle class family. He was taught about the dignity of work and the importance of looking out for each other. He started his first business at the age of 14 because he knew he was going to have to put himself through school. He's lived those values."" The Clinton appearance was straight out of McAuliffe's playbook from day one. No one in Virginia is surprised that his campaign deployed Clinton at this late stage of the game, an effort to stir up scads of press attention and drown out the cash-strapped Cuccinelli, who is not even airing television ads in the crucial northern Virginia media market this weekend, two ad-buying sources told CNN. Cuccinelli spent Saturday rallying the conservative base with Mike Huckabee in central Virginia. The Democrats' goal is to lock in McAuliffe's lead and keep their boot on Cuccinelli's neck as they head into the final stretch. And guess what: former President Bill Clinton, the big dog himself, will also be campaigning for McAuliffe in the coming weeks. Date TBD.","Former secretary of state campaigns for Democratic candidate .

"Erie, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The image remains chilling nearly eight years later: a pizza deliveryman sitting cross-legged on the pavement with a homemade bomb clamped around his neck, surrounded by nervous police who crouch behind their cars. ""Why isn't anybody trying to get this thing off me?"" he shouts to the dozens of officers nearby. But before a bomb squad can arrive, the device goes off, killing 46-year-old Brian Wells. In the agonizing minutes before his death on August 28, 2003, Wells told police the bomb had been fastened to his body by people who ordered him to rob a bank and follow a detailed checklist before it would be disarmed -- instructions that amounted to a twisted scavenger hunt. Timeline, evidence photos, video, 911 audio . The case fueled years of debate about whether the hapless Wells had been the victim of a heinous murder or a willing participant in a horrifically botched crime. The FBI later concluded that Wells had been a participant and closed the books on the case in March. Two people that agents identified as having been part of the scheme are in prison; a third has died. But Wells' family still believes he was a blameless victim -- ""innocent 100 percent,"" his sister, Jean Heid, told CNN. ""They screwed up big time,"" Heid said. ""They let an innocent man, my brother, die while in their custody and they didn't even lift a finger to help him. ""This case is going to be looked at for years to come, and they don't want it known that they screwed up,"" she said. ""Brian never would have done this."" In particular, she said, one of the plotters escaped justice. According to the FBI, Floyd Stockton knew of the robbery, but received immunity from prosecution and was allowed to go free. Prosecutors never called him as a witness in the trials, saying he was ill at the time. The FBI believes a Stockton associate, William Rothstein, was the mastermind of the heist and likely made the bomb, the affidavit says. Bombmaking materials were found in Rothstein's home. According to the FBI affidavit, one of the admitted conspirators said Stockton carried the bomb out of Rothstein's garage on the day of the robbery and handed it to Rothstein. Read the entire FBI affidavit warrant . Rothstein then secured the bomb around Wells' neck and followed him to the PNC Bank branch that Wells robbed shortly before his death, the affidavit states, quoting a witness who talked to Rothstein's girlfriend, Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong. Stockton is a registered sex offender who was a fugitive from a rape charge in Washington state at the time the plot unfolded and was staying with Rothstein at the time, according to court papers. According to Kenneth Barnes, a convicted crack dealer who is now serving a 20-year prison term in the bomb plot, Stockton was to have divvied up the money from the bank heist. Stockton has rebuffed repeated requests for comment from CNN, both by telephone and in person. Barnes also gave the FBI information that implicated Wells. According to an FBI agent's court affidavit, Barnes told authorities that Wells had been discussing the hold up about a month before it took place. Barnes' story had been corroborated by another witness in the affidavit. By all accounts, the 2003 case evolved into one of the most complicated and bizarre crimes in the annals of the FBI. Police investigating fake collar bomb extortion plot . Half an hour before the bomb went off, Wells had walked into the PNC branch on Peach Street in Erie. The bomb sat on his chest beneath a white T-shirt, which had the word ""Guess"" spray-painted on it. And he carried a cane, which turned out to be a homemade shotgun. Wells handed over a series of notes to the tellers, demanding $250,000. Tellers didn't have nearly that much in cash, and Wells walked out with a little less than $9,000. Police caught up with him in the parking lot of a nearby eyeglass shop, where he died begging for help. Because it was a bank robbery, the FBI became the lead investigative agency. Agents quickly assembled a task force of more than 50 law enforcement officers from a half-dozen federal, state and local agencies. At first, the FBI saw Wells as a victim. Rich Schapiro, a writer for Wired magazine, has reported extensively on the case and told CNN that the notes Wells carried led him to believe he could live. ""The note suggested at the very end of this, if he completed it in the allotted time -- which wasn't much -- that he would be able to save his life,"" Schapiro said. One federal law enforcement official says the cast of characters ultimately linked to the crime is ""like a band of criminal misfits."" According to the FBI, those misfits began to turn on each other less than a month after Wells died. On September 21, Rothstein called Pennsylvania State Police to report that there was a body in his freezer -- the body of a man named James Roden, whom he said was killed because he was going to report the bomb plot to authorities, according to the FBI affidavit. Rothstein told FBI agents that Roden had been killed by Diehl-Armstrong and that he had helped Diehl-Armstrong hide the body. After her arrest, Diehl-Armstrong implicated Rothstein in the bomb plot, and she eventually told investigators she gunned down Roden when he threatened to go to police about the plan. Rothstein died of cancer before being officially linked to the crime. Diehl-Armstrong is now serving prison terms both for the botched heist and for Roden's killing.

"(CNN) -- Artist Lucian Freud, known for his thick application of paints in painstakingly created, highly stylized portraits, has died at the age of 88, his publicist said Thursday. He died Wednesday night of an unspecified illness at his home in London. ""My family and I mourn Lucian Freud not only as one of the great painters of the twentieth century but also as a very dear friend,"" said his longtime dealer William R. Acquavella in a written statement. ""As the foremost figurative artist of his generation he imbued both portraiture and landscape with profound insight, drama and energy. In company he was exciting, humble, warm and witty. He lived to paint and painted until the day he died, far removed from the noise of the art world."" In 2008, one of Freud's works -- the 1995 painting ""Benefits Supervisor Sleeping"" -- fetched $33.6 million during bidding at Christie's auction house in New York, setting a then-record for a work by a living artist. The painting depicts Sue Tilley, a manager of a government-run job center in London, lying naked on her side on a worn-out couch with nothing to hide her folds of flesh. The son of architect Ernst Freud and the grandson of psychoanalysis founder Sigmund Freud, Lucian was born in 1922 in Berlin. Eleven years later, as Nazism was rising, he and his family fled to London. There, he and his two brothers enrolled in English schools. He served as a merchant seaman in the Atlantic in 1941. He studied for a brief time at the Central School of Art in London and at Cedric Morris' East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing in Dedham, according to a biography posted by the Tate Modern in London, where he had an exhibition. But he received little formal training in art, according to a statement from his publicist, Bettina Prentice. Freud had his first solo exhibition at the Lefevre Gallery in 1944. In his 20s, he was using delicately, thinly applied oils in his paintings of people, animals, and plants, which were shown in unusual juxtapositions. His subjects were precise, crisp and cleanly contoured. But in the mid-1950s, he replaced his sable brushes for brushes made of coarse hog hair and used looser strokes to more freely depict his subjects. It was during that decade that he concentrated on the portrait, which became the focus of his work. In 1966, he painted his first nude. ""I paint people,"" he said. ""Not because of what they are like, not exactly in spite of what they are like, but how they happen to be."" By the 1980s, Freud was applying thick layers of paint to convey a tactile sense of reality. ""I want paint to work as flesh,"" he told his biographer, Lawrence Gowing, in 1982. ""As far as I am concerned the paint is the person. I want it to work for me as flesh does."" Throughout his life, he remained committed to realism. Though he painted commissioned portraits for the likes of Lord Rothschild and the queen of England, most of his subjects were his lovers, relatives and friends -- including artists Francis Bacon and David Hockney. They were typically painted in daily sessions that lasted six hours and stretched over weeks, months or years. ""The picture, in order to move us, must never merely remind us of life, but must acquire a life of its own, precisely in order to reflect life,"" Freud said in a program broadcast by the BBC. Freud's work has been exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin, the Museo Correr in Venice, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Tate Britain, the Scottish National Gallery of Art, the Stadtisches Kunstmuseum Spendhaus Reutlingen in Germany, the Museum für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt, Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid, the Fundacio La Caixa in Barcelona, the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, and the Setagaya Art Museum in Tokyo. His marriage to Kitty Garman in 1948 ended in divorce, as did his second marriage, to Lady Caroline Blackwood. ""He is survived by many children from his first marriage and from a series of romantic relationships,"" his publicist said.

"Mexican authorities accused four top military officials of connections with organized crime in a high-profile case that has renewed debate over the role of government troops in the drug war. A former deputy defense secretary was among the officials in a maximum-security prison in central Mexico Wednesday, a day after prosecutors accused them of having cartel ties. One of Mexico's most notorious accused drug lords, Edgar ""La Barbie"" Valdez Villarreal, was also indicted in the case Tuesday, but authorities did not specify the connection between him and the military officials. Authorites have described the American-born Valdez, known as ""La Barbie"" because of his blue eyes and fair complexion, as one of the most ruthless drug traffickers in Mexico. A judge charged him with homicide Tuesday, but authorities did not provide details about the allegations against him. Valdez is also accused in the United States of attempting to launder money and conspiring to import and distribute cocaine. More than 47,500 people have been killed in drug-related violence in Mexico since December 2006, when President Felipe Calderon announced a crackdown on cartels. In the halls of Mexico's Congress, this week's indictment of the military officials rekindled discussion over a hallmark of Calderon's strategy: deploying thousands of troops into the streets to patrol hot spots where warring cartels are battling over turf. ""While the army is in the streets, when there are these kinds of topics that are very sensitive coming up, it seems to me that we must look at this process with all the transparency in the world so that there aren't any doubts about the fair trial that everyone deserves, including the generals,"" Sen. Ruben Camarillo of the conservative National Action Party told Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. Mary Telma Guajardo of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party told Notimex that the case was an unfortunate sign that organized crime had infiltrated the military's ranks. ""We have to find a way to protect the Mexican Army because it is one of our most prestigious institutions,"" she said. Brig. Gen. Roberto Dawe Gonzalez, retired Lt. Col. Silvio Isidro de Jesus Hernandez Soto and retired Gen. Ricardo Escorcia Vargas and Tomas Angeles Dauahare -- a retired general and former deputy defense secretary -- were charged Tuesday. The military officials were arrested in May, but Tuesday's indictment marked the first time formal charges were brought against them. Angeles' attorney, Ricardo Sanchez, told CNNMexico.com that the former defense official had been expecting the charges and welcomed the opportunity to defend his innocence in a trial. In May, after the officials were detained, all three major political parties in Mexico called for a full investigation into reports that he and other officers were being bribed to protect the now defunct Beltran Leyva cartel. Lawmakers have lamented what could be one of the highest-level corruption cases in Mexico's recent history. ""If proven, the full weight of the law must be applied because they have been federal government officials and are responsible for combating organized crime, and if they are colluding with them the punishment should set an example,"" legislator Arturo Santana told state-run media.","A former deputy defense secretary is charged with connections to organized crime .

"Chris Hadfield has conquered space. Now he's conquering the Internet, too. A video of the Canadian astronaut singing David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" from the International Space Station has been zipping around the Web at light speed since it was posted Sunday. The five-minute clip features Hadfield singing a modified version of the tune and strumming an acoustic guitar while floating through a space module, more than 200 miles above the Earth. By Monday afternoon, it had more than 1.8 million views on YouTube, 3,000 comments on Reddit and was being widely shared across social networks. Hadfield already was something of a social media star, with 260,000 fans on Facebook and more than 825,000 followers on Twitter. During his five months aboard the International Space Station, he has posted numerous photos and videos of himself preparing meals, brushing his teeth and explaining how to vomit in space. But the elegant ""Space Oddity"" video, reportedly months in the making, may rocket him into a higher orbit. Hadfield's earnest voice and unique perch in space brings a moving immediacy to Bowie's verses, and when he sings, ""I'm floating in a most peculiar way"" while actually floating, it's a powerful moment. Because Hadfield's vocals and guitar were recorded on the space station (and mixed with supporting tracks by Emm Gryner, a Canadian musician who once sang backup for Bowie), some observers are calling it the first music video made in space. Commenters on Reddit praised the video's simplicity and genuineness. ""The floating guitar is really floating, it's not some computer animation or trickery. The Earth turning behind him in the windows is the real deal. That's us, that's our blue dot, not some stock image, or animation ...,"" wrote one Redditor. ""The video has none of the Hollywood fakery we are used to. Its power comes from this authenticity."" Hadfield took a few liberties with the lyrics of the 1969 Bowie song, which became a hit upon its 1973 rerelease. In the original song, Ground Control loses radio contact with the astronaut, Major Tom, implying that the mission has failed. But Hadfield omits that part. Bowie himself acknowledged the video, tweeting, ""CHRIS HADFIELD SINGS SPACE ODDITY IN SPACE!"" The 53-year-old Hadfield launched aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft in December and in March became the first Canadian to lead a spaceship as commander of the International Space Station. The video clip was a farewell of sorts: Hadfield, Soyuz Cmdr. Roman Romanenko and Flight Engineer Tom Mars landed safely in their Soyuz spacecraft Tuesday in Kazakhstan as scheduled, according to NASA. One Reddit commenter may have spoken for many when he wrote, ""You'd better freakin' make it safely or this video will be the biggest tear-jerker on the Internet.""

"Sendai, Japan (CNN) -- Wednesday broke in Japan with news of a new blaze at the damaged nuclear plant that crews have struggled to control since last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami, adding to radiation fears in a country racing to avoid a full-on nuclear crisis. The fire was discovered Wednesday morning in the northwestern corner of the No. 4 reactor building at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, an official with Tokyo Electric Power Company told reporters. It was the latest setback for a country struggling to dig its way out of the wreckage wrought by last week's earthquake and tsunami. At least 3,676 people have died, the National Police Agency said Wednesday morning. Another 7,558 people are missing and 1,990 were injured, it said. Shell-shocked survivors huddled in cramped shelters, grieved over lost loved ones and worried about relatives who are missing across villages and towns inundated by the tsunami waves spawned by Friday's 9.0-magnitude quake off the east coast of Honshu. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan has called the disaster the country's worst crisis since World War II, and one firm says that the earthquake and tsunami are likely to surpass Hurricane Katrina as the most expensive disaster in history. Stocks in Japan opened higher Wednesday morning, one day after the nation's main market index suffered one of its biggest drops on record. Tuesday, the Asian economic powerhouse reeled as stocks plummeted, sending shock waves through global markets. ""The scale of this event has taken everyone by surprise,"" said Patrick Fuller, a Red Cross spokesman. ""It's stretched resources to the max."" The latest fire at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in northeastern Japan comes one day after another fire there and an explosion at the plant's No. 2 reactor. Radiation level readings spiked at the building gate during the first fire but went down after the blaze was extinguished. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said amounts returned to a level that would not cause ""harm to human health."" Radiation levels in Tokyo were twice the usual level Tuesday, but they were too negligible to pose a health threat, officials said. But Japanese authorities could not rule out the possibility of a meltdown at the troubled reactors. While sea water was being pumped into the reactors in an effort to prevent further damage, ""it cannot necessarily be called a stable situation,"" Edano had said Tuesday. A meltdown occurs when nuclear fuel rods cannot be cooled, thus melting the reactor core and causing a release of radioactivity. In the worst-case scenario, the fuel can spill out of the containment unit and spread toxic radioactivity through the air and water. That, public health officials say, can cause both immediate and long-term health problems, including radiation poisoning and cancer. The plant's owners have taken precautions to protect the people in Fukushima Prefecture, where the reactors sit. The plant is about 138 miles (225 kilometers) from Tokyo. They evacuated all but about 50 workers from the facility and urged people within 18.6 miles (30 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors. The government imposed a no-fly zone over the 30-kilometer radius ""because of detected radiation after explosions"" there, the country's transportation ministry said. Edano said analysts also have their eyes on reactors No. 5 and 6 at the plant, where cooling systems weren't functioning well, though the temperature had dropped slightly Tuesday. Concerns about hot radioactive fuel boiling off cooling water and catching on fire continued into Wednesday, with plant operators and government officials considering a plan to use helicopters to drop water into the cooling pond through the damaged roof of the reactor building, according to a Kyodo News report. For many across Japan, calming jittery nerves is becoming increasingly difficult as the situation at the damaged facility looks increasingly dire. ""I think, from a sanity standpoint, I'm trying to side with the cool-headed point of view because I don't want to think about the possibly of a full-blown meltdown,"" said Osaki resident Tyler Martin. ""So far, the winds are blowing north-northeast, so if a lot of radiation leaks, Tokyo shouldn't get a lot of the exposure,"" said Robert F. Mendel, who lives in suburban Tokyo. ""Of course, if the winds change, that's a different story. We've been advised to wear long sleeves, a cap, a surgical mask to reduce the amount of exposure -- that is, cover as much skin as possible."" Across the country, emergency workers from Japan, foreign governments and international aid groups continued to scour tangled and displaced piles of debris, searching for survivors. Ninety-one countries and regions and six international organizations have offered assistance, according to the Japanese foreign affairs ministry. Public broadcaster NHK reported that 450,000 people were living in shelters, and many schools had turned into emergency shelters. In the area of Sendai, the capital of Miyagi Prefecture, several tractor-trailers with cars on top had flipped over. Personal belongings -- a child's doll, an empty shoe, wedding photos covered in mud -- lay in heaps where houses once stood. Cold weather has increased the hardship for disaster victims and rescuers. Rescuers report that some victims have been exposed to cold weather and water, in some cases for days. Conditions are expected to worsen, with temperatures forecast to drop below freezing by Wednesday across portions of the earthquake zone, accompanied by snow, heavy rain and the threat of mudslides. Already in Sendai, cold rain and sleet fell on the decimated city Tuesday, and snow fell in parts of northeastern Japan. Rescue work is also being complicated by the hundreds of aftershocks that have rocked Japan since Friday's quake. The U.S. Geological Survey reported Tuesday at least three quakes with magnitudes of 6.0 or greater, and more than a dozen others greater than 5.0 or greater. Experts predict that the earthquake and tsunami will rank among the costliest natural disasters on record. Jayanta Guin, senior vice president of research and modeling for AIR Worldwide, said it is clear that the total losses will ""be far greater than we experienced in Katrina."" That 2005 hurricane, which devastated New Orleans and the U.S. Gulf Coast, had estimated losses of $125 billion, according to the Insurance Information Institute. While agencies are working to raise money, donations have been slow to come. The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a newspaper covering nonprofit organizations, says donations to nonprofit organizations have reached about $25 million so far. The total is far below the first four-day totals of other recent natural disasters, including Hurricane Katrina and the crisis in Haiti, it said. Wide-scale economic problems also loom. Japanese stocks closed down 10.55% Tuesday, the third steepest percentage fall in the Nikkei's history. That was on top of a 6.2% drop Monday, the first full trading day after the quake. Wednesday, the Nikkei 225 index, the most prominent measure of Tokyo market stocks, rose 520 points, or 6%, shortly after the market opened. All three of the major U.S. stock indexes closed down about 1.2% Tuesday, after plunging much deeper earlier in the day on fears of the Japanese economic downturn. Friday's quake was the strongest in recorded history to hit Japan, according to USGS records that date to 1900. The USGS revised the magnitude of the quake from 8.9 to 9.0 on Monday.

"Progress. It's been seemingly nonexistent in Washington for weeks, as Republicans and Democrats squabbled about funding the government and whether to raise its borrowing limit. Both sides drew their lines in the sand and talked vociferously at each other, but not to each other. On Thursday, 10 days into the government's partial shutdown, the tide appeared to turn. House Republicans offered a plan to temporarily stave off the threat of a first-ever U.S. debt default. President Barack Obama listened to them. Both sides agreed to keep on talking. Said Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican: ""We're all working together now."" Sessions spoke early Thursday evening after he and fellow House Republicans talked with Obama at the White House. Afterward, the Obama administration described the session as ""good"" -- saying the President listened to Republican proposals and the two sides discussed ""potential paths forward."" And House Majority Leader Eric Cantor called it ""very useful."" ""We're going to have more discussions on both sides tonight,"" the Virginia Republican said. The fact the two sides are talking, though, doesn't mean they have agreed to anything yet. After all, they have been bitterly divided on party lines for weeks, routinely throwing barbs but rarely trading proposals. House Republicans initially passed a series of measures tying government funding to defunding or dismantling Obamacare, the president's signature health care reform. And they've insisted that they won't increase the nation's borrowing limit without cuts first. Obama, meanwhile, has been just as firm in his position: Pass ""clean"" -- meaning no add-ons or qualifications -- bills to fund the government and raise the debt limit, and only then will we talk. One big deadline passed without an agreement -- October 1, when the partial shutdown began no funding had been authorized to keep the government running. And there seemed little movement toward addressing the next one -- October 17, when the Treasury Department has said the government will run out of money to pay its bills unless something is done. Now a plan from House Republicans to temporarily boost the nation's borrowing limit and start talks about reopening the government shifted the dynamic. What it didn't do was meet Democrats' demand to fund the government right away. Asked after attending a White House meeting of his own Thursday with the President about the prospect of the debt limit lifting while the government stays partially closed, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid didn't mince words: ""It's not going to happen."" Obama made clear, during his session with House Republicans, that he won't give concessions to reopen the government, according to a Democratic source familiar with the meeting. Yet no less than White House spokesman Jay Carney cheered the movement, saying Obama was ""happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House"" over the need to avoid a possible default. Will 2014 election solve anything? Deep into Thursday night, these heads were getting together to try to find a resolution. The White House hopes these initial staff-level discussions will let it know exactly what Republicans want, the Democratic source said. Rep. Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, said both sides are talking ""in good faith"" about not just the debt ceiling, but what it will take to restart the government. ""There was not a timeline set,"" said Rogers. ""But we want to move quickly."" Anti-Obamacare provisions no longer in GOP plans . Optimism in Washington triggered relief on Wall Street as the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its biggest one-day gain of the year at 323 points. Investors have been nervous over the political stalemate and the possibility of a debt default and its potential economic consequences. This came a day after Obama said in a separate meeting with House Democrats that he would consider a short-term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit, a Democratic lawmaker told CNN. ""If that's what (House Speaker John) Boehner needs to climb out of the tree that he's stuck in, then that's something we should look at,"" according to the lawmaker, who attended the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Some congressional Democrats have balked at the outline of the GOP offer, saying the government must reopen and the debt ceiling must be increased to get broader talks going. ""One way or another both of those have to happen,"" said veteran Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan. Another Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said Obama ""needs to press for the opening of the government."" ""Without a doubt the default would be much more catastrophic, but I've got constituents, a lot of whom work for the federal government who are going through catastrophes every hour,"" Cummings said. Paul Ryan steps into budget fight . One thing any budget resolution won't include, it appears, is provisions targeting the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Ryan, who was the Republican party's vice presidential nominee last year, didn't mention Obamacare in a Wall Street Journal op-ed -- saying instead that politicians from both parties should focus on ""modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code."" As others have done in recent days, GOP Rep. James Lankford of Oklahoma told CNN on Thursday that going after the President's signature health reform is ""currently off the table."" Yet Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- one of the most vocal Republicans in the debate -- wasn't so ready to let the health care issue go. Speaking Thursday on CNN's ""Crossfire,"" he said  ""Democrats in this town do not want to discuss Obamacare."" On Obama's signature health care reform and what's happening in Washington generally, Cruz said that it's House Republicans who ""are listening to the millions of Americans"" to do what's best for them. According to a GOP source, it's not certain whether Boehner can gain support from some or most of his GOP caucus to support a plan without anything to do with Obamacare or other concessions. That could mean -- if a proposal like the one floated Thursday proceeds -- the Speaker may need Democratic votes to pass it. Boehner demands cuts for debt limit increase . Failure to raise the debt ceiling by next week's deadline would leave the government unable to borrow money to pay its bills for the first time in its history. And absent a breakthrough, the shutdown would continue at a cost estimated at up to $50 billion a month. All of it is taking a toll on Washington's reputation: A national CNN/ORC International survey released Monday indicated that Americans were blaming all parties in the fight, though Republicans got the worst of it. 5 crazy side effects from the shutdown .

"The Thai army declared martial law throughout the country Tuesday in a surprise move that an aide to the embattled Prime Minister said the government didn't know about beforehand. ""They took this action unilaterally. The government is having a special meeting regarding this. We have to watch and see if the army chief honors his declaration of impartiality,"" the aide said, describing the situation as ""half a coup d'etat."" Lt. Gen. Nipat Thonglek told CNN the move was not a coup. ""The Army aims to maintain peace, order and public safety for all groups and all parties,"" a ticker running on the army's television channel said. ""People are urged not to panic, and can carry on their business as usual. Declaring martial law is not a coup d'etat."" Martial law went into effect at 3 a.m. on Tuesday, the ticker said. All Thai TV stations are being guarded by the military, Thai public television announced, showing pictures of soldiers and armored vehicles taking positions outside broadcast facilities in the country's capital. In a statement read on Thai television, the military declared that all of the country's radio and television stations must suspend their normal programs ""when it is needed."" The dramatic announcements come days after the head of the army issued a stern warning after political violence had surged in the country's capital. Political tensions have been running high in Thailand. Supporters and opponents of the country's government have staged mass protests in recent days, and earlier this month a top court removed caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office, along with nine cabinet ministers. It's too soon to tell whether the military's declaration of martial law will ease tensions or heighten them, analysts said. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political science professor, described the situation as ""very volatile."" ""This is a precarious time now for the army,"" he said. ""They have to be even-handed."" If the military appears to be favoring one side, he said, violence could escalate rather than cool down. ""If it's seen as favoring one side or the other side, then we could see more violence and turmoil against the military,"" he said. Paul Quaglia, director at Bangkok-based risk assessment firm PQA Associates, described the situation as ""martial law light."" ""Right now the military has deployed troops around key intersections of the city. Traffic is a real mess here at the moment, but there's no violence,"" he said. ""I think what the military is trying to do with this...is to convince protesters to go home. They're trying to dial down the tensions here as well as preempt several large rallies and strikes that were scheduled for later this week."" But what happens next will depend on how protesters react, he said. ""The military is taking a step by step, gentle approach to see if they can get things to improve,"" Quaglia said. ""If not, they'll of course have to ratchet up their actions."" Nipat said the precise restrictions of martial law were being worked out. The government's ""red shirt"" support base, many of whom hail from the country's rural north and northeast, view Yingluck's ouster as a ""judicial coup"" and have been protesting what they consider an unfair bias by many of the country's institutions against their side. Anti-government protesters are seeking a new government -- but not through elections, which the opposition Democrat Party has boycotted, arguing the alleged corruption of their political rivals makes widespread reform necessary before any meaningful vote can be held. Increased government efforts to improve security are a positive step, Quaglia said. ""That being said, martial law will not solve the political problems that continue to haunt this country,"" he said. ""The differences are stark, and I don't think the military can step in and by force fix the political issues.""","Analyst: Military is trying to convince protesters to go home, ""dial down the tensions""

"After more than a year adrift in the Pacific Ocean, and after eight years away from his hometown, Jose Salvador Alvarenga is home. Around 8:30 p.m. (9:30 p.m. ET), after arriving on a flight from Los Angeles, Alvarenga was wheeled before a swarm of reporters in the airport terminal in El Salvador's capital of San Salvador. Looking tired and weak, he appeared unable to muster any words after being handed a microphone. Alvarenga waved meekly -- eliciting applause from travelers and airport employees who'd lined up to see him -- and sat quietly in his wheelchair as people shouted out and cameras flashed. Then, he put his hand on his head as he was wheeled away. His next stop was to be a hospital, where Violeta Menjivar, El Salvador's vice minister of health, said Alvarenga's health will be monitored. If and when everything checks out, presumably, Alvarenga will be free to roam his native El Salvador. But it's understandable if, when that happens, it will seem like a strange place. His miraculous -- some say unbelievable -- story has captured the attention of so many. Even where he was found -- in an atoll in the Marshall Islands that is as secluded a locale as they come, set deep in the Pacific Ocean some 2,000 miles from Papua New Guinea and 2,400 miles from Hawaii -- Alvarenga's rescue and recovery attracted a crush of media. It got so intense he moved to an undisclosed location to avoid the hubbub, sources familiar with his care told CNN on Saturday. Irene Sanchez, a spokeswoman for El Salvador's foreign ministry, said Alvarenga ""felt harassed"" over the last two weeks, after having spent so many weeks alone. Now that he's going home, she said Tuesday that he's looking forward to spending time with his parents and daughter, as well as eating pupusas, a traditional Salvadoran dish. As to all the attention from everyone else, Sanchez said, ""He doesn't know what awaits him."" ""He doesn't know what it is like to be a celebrity, or how to respond to all the media attention."" His odyssey began in late 2012 when, he said, he left Mexico on what was supposed to be a one-day fishing expedition. But Alvarenga said he and a 23-year-old companion were blown off course by northerly winds and then caught in a storm. Eventually, the pair lost use of their engines and, according to Alvarenga, had no radio signal to report their plight. Four weeks into their drift, his companion died of starvation because he refused to eat raw birds and turtles, Alvarenga said. Eventually, he threw the body overboard. Castaway recounts how he survived . Alvarenga's next interaction with humans came January 30. It was then that islanders on Ebon, a remote atoll on the already remote Marshall Islands,  spotted the mysterious visitor. As he inhaled pancake after pancake, Alvarenga recounted what he'd gone through. Soon after, images of the bearded, bedraggled castaway began circulating worldwide. His claims about his time stranded at sea garnered widespread skepticism about how he could survive the more than 6,000-mile trek across the open ocean. But officials in the Marshall Islands have said repeatedly that they have no reason to doubt the story. His story is resonating in his hometown, the coastal Salvadoran village of Garita Palmera. Balloons and ribbons hang across the house where Alvarenga's family lives there, and a ""Welcome Home"" banner is strung up outside on a palm tree archway. A heart-shaped decoration made by his niece says, ""May God bless you."" Now clean-shaven and gaining strength, Alvarenga is expected to end up back in Garita Palmera for his homecoming. As she awaited his return this week, his mother, Julia Alvarenga, said she'd been praying for him since his last visit eight years ago. ""That was the only hope I had all this time,"" she said. ""I would pray to God, and I won't lie to you, I was crying; but I never lost my faith."" 5 things about the castaway's tale .","Alvarenga appears in a wheelchair in San Salvador's airport, looking tired and weak .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge declared a mistrial Monday in the case of two U.S. security contractors accused of killing two Afghanistan civilians. The jury in the case against Christopher Drotleff and Justin Cannon told Judge Robert Doumar that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. A retrial has been scheduled for March 1, 2011. Drotleff and Cannon worked as security contractors for a subsidiary of Xe, the military contracting firm formerly known as Blackwater Worldwide. Each were charged with two counts of second-degree murder and one count of attempted murder in connection with a May 2009 shooting in Kabul, Afghanistan. The 12-count, 19-page indictment returned by a federal grand jury in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia also included weapons charges against the two men. Trey Robert Kelleter, the attorney for Drotleff, expressed disappointment with Monday's mistrial declaration in the federal court in Norfolk, Virginia. ""We thought the evidence showed Chris had acted in self defense,"" Kelleter said. ""It is a real hardship on his family."" Kelleter said his client remained in custody pending a detention hearing scheduled for Wednesday. According to Kelleter, a retrial is likely because of the deadlocked jury. Peter Carr, the spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office, declined to comment. Both Drotleff and Cannon were in Afghanistan working for the security company Paravant -- a subsidiary of Xe -- to help the U.S. Army train Afghan troops. Drotleff, Cannon and two other contractors, Steven McClain and Armando Hamid, were driving their interpreters on a busy Kabul street called Jalalabad Road on May 5, 2009, when they said a car slammed into one of their two cars. The men said they got out to help their colleagues, and the vehicle that had struck the car did a U-turn and headed back at them. The contractors said they fired at the oncoming vehicle in self-defense. The incident spotlights the issue of the role and conduct of U.S. security contractors in Afghanistan. A similar issue arose in Iraq after a September 2007 confrontation involving then-Blackwater contractors that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead. Blackwater lost its contract there after Iraq's government refused to renew its operating license. The company then changed its name to Xe, and it continues to receive multimillion-dollar contracts in Afghanistan.","NEW: Defense attorney says a retrial is likely .

"For actor Harrison Ford, who is starring in a movie adaptation of Orson Scott Card's heralded and popular novel ""Ender's Game,"" statements against same-sex marriage by the science-fiction author ""are not an issue for me."" At a Comic-Con news conference on Thursday, Ford responded to concerns that Card's comments have overshadowed the production of the movie. The author of the 1985 novel professed his opposition to same-sex marriage in 2009 when he joined he board of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex unions. Although Card released a statement declaring the same-sex marriage issue ""moot"" after last month's Supreme Court ruling striking down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act, the film has continued to be plagued by controversy. Ford told reporters that while he fundamentally disagrees with the author's stance, the film stands separate from the issue. ""I think none of Mr. Card's concerns regarding the issues of gay marriage are part of the thematics of this film,"" Ford said. ""He has written something that I think is of value to us all concerning moral responsibility. I think his views outside of those that we deal with in this film are not an issue for me to deal with and something I have really no opinion on. Comic-Con: What we can't wait to see . ""I am aware of his statements admitting that the question of gay marriage is a battle that he lost and he admits that he lost it. I think we all know that we've all won. That humanity has won. And I think that's the end of the story."" For Ford, ""Ender's Game"" addresses its own social and political concerns. The film is set in the future, depicting a child military trained by the government to wage interplanetary war. Ford plays Col. Hyrum Graff, a military commander who trains the titular character of Ender Wiggin, played by Asa Butterfield. Even though the movie is set in a science fiction universe, Ford said he has found many contemporary comparisons to the moral concerns of the story. ""This movie is very prescient, and I think the novel was prescient in recognizing something that we now have as a reality in our lives, which is the ability to wage war at a distance,"" Ford said. ""So the morality of that military commander and the military command structure, the morality of a society which raises a military and wages war are the moral concerns of this film and something we are wrestling with daily. ""The issue of interplanetary warfare is the science fiction aspect of it, but what gives it such emotional tone and reality is that these are the concerns of our everyday lives. ""Drone warfare and the capacity that we have technologically is one part of the moral package. The other is the use of young people in the business of war, which has always historically been the case. Our youngest and fittest of our cultures have always been the ones who are first in line for warfare."" Share your mini-interviews from Comic-Con . Ford, who noted that it was particularly compelling to work with ""talented young actors"" such as Butterfield and Hailee Steinfeld, as well as Sir Ben Kingsley, was also asked whether he found any comparison between Col. Graff and his famed ""Star Wars"" character, Han Solo. ""Graff is a very complex character that's charged with an awesome responsibility,"" Ford said. ""The complex moral issues are part of Graff's story. Ender doesn't really face so much the issues of morality until the end of the film until he knows what's happened to him. ""Graff is aware of his moral responsibilities all through his part of the story. I was just delighted to be involved in a film of such high ambition with such talented people. I think Graff is a much more complex character than Han Solo, which doesn't mean that I regret Han Solo."" ""Ender's Game"" is scheduled to be released in theaters on November 1. Summit, the film's studio, released a new viral clip from the film Wednesday in honor of its presence at Comic-Con, and they also premiered a trailer for the film at the fan panel that followed the news conference.","Harrison Ford appeared at Comic-Con to discuss his new film ""Ender's Game""

"Feedly, the Web-content app that got a surge of new users when Google announced it was pulling the plug on its Reader service, is making a play to inherit even more. On Wednesday, the company announced it's rolling out Feedly Cloud, creating a one-click way for Google Reader users to migrate to Feedly, and a new, stand-alone desktop version of the service. Like Google Reader, which will shut down July 1, Feedly pulls content from various websites into a customizable feed. ""With the release of Feedly Cloud, Feedly today transitions from a product to a platform,"" the company said in a blog post. Since Google announced it was shutting down Reader in March, Feedly's user numbers have already tripled from 4 million to about 12 million, a spokesman told CNN. The main drawback for many prospective users has been that Feedly has primarily been a mobile app, unlike Reader, which users accessed mainly on the Web. In March, Google said that while Reader had many loyal users, its popularity had been waning. It hadn't seen a significant update since 2011, and many of its social features were stripped as the company began pushing users to Google+, its social network. According to the blog post, Feedly Cloud already is processing more than 25 million feeds daily. There are multiple third-party apps attached to it, allowing users multiple options as to how they can set up their RSS feeds. An RSS feed processes posts from blogs and websites and pulls them all together in one place in a standard format. Publishers like RSS (rich site summary) because it allows users to subscribe, theoretically putting every new post in front of them automatically instead of relying on the user to check in for new content. Feedly said that a stand-alone version has been one of the more requested new features since the news broke of Google Reader's demise. Previously, plug-ins or extensions would let users of browsers such as Chrome and Firefox access a version of Feedly, but even those patched-together versions weren't available to users of popular browsers such as Opera and Internet Explorer. Feedly Cloud will be available Wednesday to visitors to Feedly's website.","Google Reader will be shut down July 1 .

"(CNN) -- A now-retracted British study that linked autism to childhood vaccines is an ""elaborate fraud,"" according to a medical journal -- a charge the physician behind the study vigorously denies. The British medical journal BMJ, which published the results of its investigation, concluded Dr. Andrew Wakefield misrepresented or altered the medical histories of all 12 of the patients whose cases formed the basis of the 1998 study -- and that there was ""no doubt"" Wakefield was responsible. The journalist who wrote the BMJ articles said Thursday he believes Wakefield should face criminal charges. However, Wakefield said his work has been ""grossly distorted."" Speaking on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" he said Wednesday he is the target of ""a ruthless, pragmatic attempt to crush any attempt to investigate valid vaccine safety concerns."" The medical publication says the study has done long-lasting damage to public health. Read autism coverage on ""The Chart"" blog. ""It's one thing to have a bad study, a study full of error, and for the authors then to admit that they made errors,"" Fiona Godlee, BMJ's editor-in-chief, told CNN. ""But in this case, we have a very different picture of what seems to be a deliberate attempt to create an impression that there was a link by falsifying the data."" Britain stripped Wakefield of his medical license in May. What causes autism? ""Meanwhile, the damage to public health continues, fueled by unbalanced media reporting and an ineffective response from government, researchers, journals and the medical profession,"" BMJ states in an editorial accompanying the work. Wakefield dismissed Brian Deer, the writer of the British Medical Journal articles, as ""a hit man who has been brought in to take me down"" by pharmaceutical interests. Deer has signed a disclosure form stating that he has no financial interest in the business. On CNN's ""American Morning"" Thursday, Deer did not deny he was paid by the BMJ. ""I was commissioned by BMJ to write the piece,"" he said. ""That's what journalists do."" He said he is also paid by the Sunday Times of London, where he has been employed since the early 1980s. ""I was being paid as a journalist,"" he told CNN's Kiran Chetry. ""Like you are. You're being paid to do your job."" ""The point you have to remember about all this, firstly, it's not me saying this. It's the editors of the BMJ,"" Deer said. ""... Secondly, this material has been published in the United Kingdom in extraordinary detail. If it is true that Andrew Wakefield is not guilty as charged, he has the remedy of bringing a libel action against myself, the Sunday Times of London, against the medical journal here, and he would be the richest man in America."" He said Wakefield's remarks amount to a smear campaign against him, noting that Wakefield has previously sued him and lost. The autism assignment was a ""routine assignment"" given to him in 2003, he said, adding that he expected it to be finished in a week or two. However, ""when you're a journalist and you see that somebody you're dealing with is lying to you,"" it must be pursued, he said. Wakefield, he said, is attempting to ""cloud the picture... Some people say he's a liar and he says I'm a liar. What he's basically trying to do is split the difference."" Allegations that he is in collusion with the pharmaceutical industry are ""another one of Andrew Wakefield's concoctions,"" Deer said. ""He knows it's not true."" Asked whether he thinks Wakefield should face criminal charges, Deer said, ""I personally do."" In addition, he said the Department of Homeland Security should take a close look at Wakefield's visa application and how he got into the United States, ""how he's been able to export his mischief."" Wendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association, defended Wakefield in a CNN interview. ""I cannot imagine for a second that Dr. Wakefield would have any reason to falsify data,"" she said. ""He's a man of integrity and honesty and truly wants to find the answers for millions of children who have been affected by autism."" Fournier accused pharmaceutical companies of trying to protect their turf. ""You can't question vaccines without being destroyed,"" she said. ""There's too much money at stake here."" J.B. Handley, the father of an 8-year-old with autism and a co-founder of Generation Rescue -- a group that believes there's a connection between autism and vaccinations -- also questioned the motivation behind the investigation into Wakefield's work. ""Children are given 36 vaccines in the U.S. by the time they reach the age of five,"" he said. ""This is an attempt to whitewash, once and for all, the notion that vaccines cause autism."" The now-discredited paper panicked many parents and led to a sharp drop in the number of children getting the vaccine that prevents measles, mumps and rubella. Vaccination rates dropped sharply in Britain after its publication, falling as low as 80% by 2004. Measles cases have gone up sharply in the ensuing years. In the United States, more cases of measles were reported in 2008 than in any other year since 1997, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90% of those infected had not been vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, the CDC reported. ""But perhaps as important as the scare's effect on infectious disease is the energy, emotion and money that have been diverted away from efforts to understand the real causes of autism and how to help children and families who live with it,"" the BMJ editorial states. Wakefield has been unable to reproduce his results in the face of criticism, and other researchers have been unable to match them. Most of his co-authors withdrew their names from the study in 2004 after learning he had had been paid by a law firm that intended to sue vaccine manufacturers -- a serious conflict of interest he failed to disclose. After years of controversy, the Lancet, the prestigious journal that originally published the research, retracted Wakefield's paper last February. Actress Jenny McCarthy, founder of Generation Rescue and whose son also has autism, declined to comment on Wednesday's developments, but has previously supported Wakefield. ""It is our most sincere belief that Dr. Wakefield and parents of children with autism around the world are being subjected to a remarkable media campaign engineered by vaccine manufacturers reporting on the retraction,"" she said after the Lancet retraction. Deer said Wakefield ""chiseled"" the data before him, ""falsifying medical histories of children and essentially concocting a picture, which was the picture he was contracted to find by lawyers hoping to sue vaccine manufacturers and to create a vaccine scare."" According to BMJ, Wakefield received more than 435,000 pounds ($674,000) from the lawyers. Godlee, the journal's editor-in-chief, said the study shows that of the 12 cases Wakefield examined in his paper, five showed developmental problems before receiving the MMR vaccine and three never had autism. ""It's always hard to explain fraud and where it affects people to lie in science,"" Godlee said. ""But it does seem a financial motive was underlying this, both in terms of payments by lawyers and through legal aid grants that he received but also through financial schemes that he hoped would benefit him through diagnostic and other tests for autism and MMR-related issues."" But Wakefield told CNN that claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism ""came from the parents, not me,"" and that his paper had ""nothing to do with the litigation."" ""These children were seen on the basis of their clinical symptoms, for their clinical need, and they were seen by expert clinicians and their disease diagnosed by them, not by me,"" he said. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, said the reporting ""represents Wakefield as a person where the ends justified the means."" But he said the latest news may have little effect on those families who still blame vaccines for their children's conditions. ""Unfortunately, his core group of supporters is not going to let the facts dissuade their beliefs that MMR causes autism,"" Wiznitzer said. ""They need to be open-minded and examine the information as everybody else."" Wakefield's defenders include David Kirby, a journalist who has written extensively on autism. He told CNN that Wakefield not only has denied falsifying data, he has said he had no way to do so. ""I have known him for a number of years. He does not strike me as a charlatan or a liar,"" Kirby said. If the BMJ allegations are true, then Wakefield ""did a terrible thing"" -- but he added, ""I personally find it hard to believe that he did that.""

"Televangelist Pat Robertson wishes Facebook had a 'vomit' button. So that he could click on it every time he came across a photograph of a gay couple kissing. Robertson who has repeatedly made clear his disapproval of homosexuality, made the latest comments Monday in response to a question he fielded from a viewer on his Christian Broadcasting Network show ""The 700 Club."" The viewer wanted to know how to address images of same-sex couples on social media sites, such as Facebook. You've got a couple of same-sex guys kissing, do you like that? Well that makes me want to throw up,"" he said. ""To me I would punch 'Vomit;' not 'Like,'"" he added. ""But they don't give you that option on Facebook."" It's not the first time Robertson, 83, has used vomit to express his sentiments on homosexuality. Robertson has also said the land would ""vomit out"" those who disobeyed the commandments of the Old Testament. Here are nine more controversial and colorful comments the evangelists has made that have gone viral: . On adultery . ""Males have a tendency to wander a little bit. And what you want to do is make a home so wonderful he doesn't want to wander."" On a man with an Alzheimer's-stricken wife . ""I know it sounds cruel, but if he's going to do something, he should divorce her and start all over again, but to make sure she has custodial care and somebody (is) looking after her."" Asked what about the ""Till death do us part"" part of the marriage vow, he said Alzheimer's is ""a kind of death."" On Walt Disney World's ""Gay Days"" ""I would warn Orlando that you're right in the way of some serious hurricanes, and I don't think I'd be waving those flags in God's face if I were you ... It'll bring about terrorist bombs; it'll bring earthquakes, tornadoes, and possibly a meteor."" On the role of a man and a woman . ""I know this is painful for the ladies to hear, but if you get married, you have accepted the headship of a man, your husband. Christ is the head of the household, and the husband is the head of the wife, and that's the way it is, period."" On feminism . ""The feminist agenda is not about equal rights for women. It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians."" On the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake . ""They were under the heel of the French, you know, Napoleon the third and whatever. And they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They said, 'We will serve you if you will get us free from the prince.' True story. And so the devil said, 'OK, it's a deal.' And they kicked the French out. The Haitians revolted and got themselves free. But ever since they have been cursed by one thing after another."" On homosexuality . ""Many of those people involved in Adolf Hitler were Satanists. Many were homosexuals. The two things seem to go together."" On assassinating Hugo Chavez . ""You know, I don't know about this doctrine of assassination, but if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it.""

"Brindisi, Italy (CNN)Conditions for the rescue of passengers off a ferry that caught fire in the Adriatic Sea could hardly have been worse. Strong winds, choppy seas and thick smoke pounded the efforts. In the end, at least 10 people died, the Italian coast guard said on Monday. But many more were saved -- 427 -- the coast guard said. Ute Kilger was one of those who survived. ""We were wet and cold, and the rain was like needles,"" she said. ""There was always these explosions and this feeling you have in your feet. It goes through your body."" Talking to CNN in donated Red Cross pajamas, she stumbled over her words: ""It was unreal, but I knew it is so real. This was really bad, to really know, it is real."" The Italian coast guard earlier said that all remaining passengers had been evacuated from the vessel, with the boat's commander finally leaving the ship at 2:50 p.m. Monday. The coast guard said it was inspecting the ship and deciding how to transport it -- and where. The public prosecutor in Bari, Italy, said he had requested the seizure of the ship as part of a criminal investigation. Authorities are waiting for authorization from Albanian officials to release the ship, because it is in Albanian waters. Giuseppe Volpe, the prosecutor, added that the owner and the captain of the ship will be notified of the investigation. No charges have been filed. More than 400 passengers were traveling on the Norman Atlantic between the Greek port of Igoumenitsa and the Italian port of Ancona when the fire began, apparently in the ferry's parking bay. 'Dying of cold' In the first three hours of the fire, around 150 people were able to escape via the vessel's lifeboats. But when the ferry lost power, the electronic arms were unable to function, leaving the rest of the boats dangling uselessly by its side. After waiting for hours in rough conditions, one Greek man told Italian state broadcaster RAI TV that passengers were ""dying of cold and suffocating from the smoke,"" and that their feet were burning from the heat of the flames. Helicopters with night vision equipment worked through the night to pull passengers off the ferry, one by one. An Italian navy medical team boarded the ship to aid passengers, some of whom had been suffering hypothermia and smoke inhalation, the navy said. The already cold conditions were worsened by the spray from tugboat hoses as authorities attempted to douse the flames. A freighter carrying 49 rescued passengers arrived at the port of Bari on Monday.  Photos showed survivors wrapped in emergency foil blankets being carried away on stretchers. One man died after he jumped or fell into the cold water, authorities said. It is unclear how the other victims died. 'Prisoners on a burning ship' Dramatic cell phone images filmed by a passenger showed flames through shattered portholes, while a wider view released by rescuers showed a huge plume of thick, black smoke streaming from the stricken vessel. Many passengers were unable to reach the lower decks because of the heat, and the water below was so cold that jumping clear of the ferry was not an option. Sea surface temperatures had been around 14 to 15 degrees Celsius (57 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit), CNN meteorologist Tom Sater said, which would have limited the survival time in the water to six hours at most. Passengers told Greek and Italian newsgroups they had felt like ""prisoners on a burning ship."" It's not known how the fire started, but it is believed to have originated in the parking bay. A truck driver told the Greek news media that trucks filled with oil were ""packed like sardines,"" their cargo scraping the ceiling, which could have set off sparks in rough seas to start a fire, he surmised. Greek authorities said the vessel's fire doors appeared to have failed, which allowed the flames to spread quickly. More on major ferry sinkings .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Opposition forces claimed a major victory Sunday in Libya, managing to block an onslaught by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's troops and maintain control of the key city of Misrata, an eyewitness said. Using machine guns, sticks and anything else they could find, crowds protected the courthouse, serving as an operations center by the opposition in Misrata, and successfully repelled Gadhafi militias armed with tanks and heavy artillery, the witness said. ""The will and the determination and dedication that people are showing here on the ground, it just makes you speechless,"" he said. A doctor at Central Misrata Hospital said 42 people were killed -- 17 from the opposition and 25 from the pro-Gadhafi forces -- and that 85 people were wounded in the fighting, which continued on the city's outskirts. The youngest victim, 3 years old, was killed by direct fire, the doctor said. Witnesses and other sources are not being named for their own safety. Humanitarian and medical aid to the central Libyan city has been blocked, U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos said in a statement Sunday. She urged authorities ""to provide access without delay to allow aid workers to help save lives."" Fighting also raged in the town of Bin Jawad, where the sounds of booms -- either aerial bombardments or heavy artillery -- could be heard echoing. The opposition also worked to keep control of Ras Lanuf. The battles came in stark contrast to the image Gadhafi's regime sought to portray in the capital, Tripoli. Throngs filled Green Square, cheering their support of Gadhafi, with some insisting they were celebrating the government's victory in Misrata. A government official said Gadhafi's regime was victorious in Ras Lanuf and in Zawiya, as well. CNN was not allowed to enter Zawiya on Sunday, and could not reach people inside the city. Reports said communications had been cut off. Libyan state TV also claimed that the government had gained control of the eastern port city of Tobruk. ""Morning victory, oh people of Libya. Victory city of Tobruk from terrorist gangs,"" the station said. Witnesses in Tobruk, though, said it was still under opposition control. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon talked Sunday morning with Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kasa, appealing for an end to hostilities and discussing ""the increasingly troubling humanitarian situation,"" according to a statement from his office. The release criticized Gadhafi's government for what it called ""disproportionate use of force and indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets."" After reports of the opposition successfully fighting off pro-Gadhafi forces in Misrata, Libyan state TV showed a graphic -- in both Arabic and English -- saying that ""strict orders have been issued to the armed forces not to enter cities taken by terrorist gangs, who took civilians as human shields and threatened to slaughter the inhabitants of those cities."" The report cited ""military sources,"" and said those cities ""are being circled by the armed forces except those neighborhoods where the terrorist gangs have sought refuge."" While the pro-Gadhafi rally in Tripoli was crowded and boisterous -- including the sounds of car horns and celebratory gunfire -- such demonstrations do not offer a clear sign of how much support the 68-year-old leader actually has. Throughout the uprising, which began February 15, witnesses in Tripoli have described the government using all sorts of methods to drum up crowds, including forcibly dragging people to them, while keeping anti-Gadhafi demonstrators off the streets. On Sunday, police forces searched cars to try to ensure that no anti-Gadhafi protesters were out on the streets, though some still managed to venture out, a witness said. Traces of bullets and blood could be seen in some districts near Tripoli's Green Square, and people were mopping the streets and cleaning the walls, the witness said. On Saturday, opposition forces had claimed two major successes: preventing pro-government forces from taking Zawiya and capturing Ras Lanuf along the coast. Opposition forces in eastern Libya briefly detained a group of British special forces. The group was let go Sunday, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. ""I can confirm that a small British diplomatic team has been in Benghazi. The team went to Libya to initiate contacts with the opposition. They experienced difficulties, which have now been satisfactorily resolved. They have now left Libya,"" Hague said in a statement. ""We intend, in consultation with the opposition, to send a further team to strengthen our dialogue in due course. This diplomatic effort is part of the UK's wider work on Libya, including our ongoing humanitarian support. We continue to press for Gadhafi to step down and we will work with the international community to support the legitimate ambitions of the Libyan people."" The strife engulfing the north African nation is reverberating across the country, the region and the world. Death toll estimates range from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000, and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime. The protesters are seeking the ouster of Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of ruling the country -- the kind of revolution that was seen in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt. But unlike in those countries, the uprising has turned into warfare. Benjamin Barber, a fellow at the New York-based Demos think tank who had worked closely with the Gadhafi Foundation, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that he felt Gadhafi, his son Saif and their supporters would likely ""fight to the death"" -- meaning a prolonged war, compared to the relatively quick and peaceful political transition that happened in Egypt and Tunisia. Even if Gadhafi is somehow ousted, Barber predicted the violence could continue as tribes duke it out for supremacy in a nation that has few significant public institutions that could fill a potentially chaotic void. Gadhafi's government has been reviled across the globe for violence against civilians, and the International Criminal Court has launched an investigation of Gadhafi, some of his sons and other leaders for possible crimes against humanity. Opposition-controlled radio announced Saturday that the country's sole legitimate representative was now the National Transitional Council, a group with 31 representatives for most of the regions in Libya. The council held its first meeting Saturday in the eastern city of Benghazi. It called Benghazi its temporary location until the ""liberation"" of the capital, according to a decree the council issued. Former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdeljeleel, whom the council said had tried to resign from Gadhafi's government several times, was announced as the council's new leader. The council also named a representative for military affairs and established a military council to oversee the ""liberation"" of Libya and reconstruct the armed forces, according to the radio announcement. The council said its main missions are to represent all of Libya internationally, liberate the country, draft a constitution and hold elections. Meanwhile, the fierce fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya, with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave. Almost 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt, the United Nations refugee agency said. The United States announced Saturday it is contributing $3 million to the International Organization for Migration to help return home thousands of non-Libyans who fled to Tunisia.

"In the afterglow of Chris Christie's smashing re-election win last November, a chorus of big-name Republicans heralded the charismatic New Jersey governor as the party's savior in 2016. Not everyone was so enamored. Just days after the election, Texas Gov. Rick Perry appeared on national television and poured cold water on Christie's impressive victory. ""He was a successful governor in New Jersey,"" Perry said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""Now does that transcend to the country? We'll see in later years and months to come. We're all different states. Is a conservative in New Jersey a conservative in the rest of the country?"" The comments made headlines, but were largely seen as just another predictable potshot fired off by one likely presidential contender jockeying for position with another. But Perry's curt dismissal belied a much deeper resentment toward Christie -- and thrust a long-simmering tension between two of the Republican Party's biggest personalities into public view. It is a rivalry that continues today and colors many of the political discussions inside the usually drama-free Republican Governors Association, the powerful fundraising committee currently helmed by Christie. Even with the slow-burning controversies that have engulfed his governorship in New Jersey, Christie, a prolific fundraiser, maintains the support of his fellow governors, barring any further revelations that contradict his story about the George Washington Bridge lane closures. But should Christie ever be forced to step aside, Perry -- along with his close ally, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -- represents another power base inside the governors association that could step into the leadership void. In Perry-world, Christie is seen as pompous and disrespectful, both to his fellow governors and the sense of collegial decorum that has ruled the governors association for years. To Christie and his allies on the committee, Perry is regarded as unserious, past his prime and too conservative for the national stage. When Christie traveled to Dallas and Fort Worth on Thursday for a series of closed-door meetings with leading governors association donors, Perry was hundreds of miles from the scene. The Democratic National Committee, which has turned its full artillery on Christie in the wake of the bridge fiasco, highlighted Perry's absence as a sign of Republicans fleeing a scandal-tarnished governor. 'They just don't like each other' The truth is that Perry likely would have avoided Christie anyway, with or without the subpoena-flecked drama back in Trenton. ""There are factions within the RGA,"" said an adviser to one Republican governor. ""Perry is kind of the leader of one, and Christie is the leader of the other. They just don't like each other."" Like most of the people interviewed for this story -- including aides to both Christie and Perry -- the adviser declined to talk on the record so as not to offend two of the most powerful governors in the country. Christie and his close-knit team control the purse strings of the governors association, a cash-flush campaign committee that will help fund the party's slate of gubernatorial candidates in 2014. And despite the embarrassment of his failed White House campaign, Perry is angling to run for president again and continues to be a gatekeeper to many GOP donors in Texas, a wealthy state that doubles as an ATM for Republican politicians. Supporters of the two men who volunteered to discuss their relationship openly were cautious with their words. ""I think there are stylistic differences based on their upbringing and where they come from,"" said Republican operative Bob Haus, chairman of Perry's 2012 caucus campaign in Iowa. ""There is a humility that comes from being from the South. And there is a brashness that comes from being from the Northeast. And that may be very apparent between the two of them."" Most accounts of their sour relationship begin in 2011, during the bruising Republican presidential campaign, in which Christie endorsed Mitt Romney on his way to the GOP nomination. With backing from some of the GOP's biggest donors, Perry entered the race late that summer to much fanfare, rocketing to the top of national polls and providing Romney with his first serious primary opponent. Perry had resigned his post as chairman of the governors association, but was still counting on support from his fellow Republican governors. But one of them, Christie, was reluctant to give it. Christie not shy with his thoughts about Perry . Throughout the GOP primary battles, even before his endorsement of Romney, Christie was not shy with his thoughts about Perry. In private sessions with donors, governors and assorted Republican power brokers, Christie asserted that Perry was far from qualified for the White House. ""Christie was unequivocal in saying that the Perry he had gotten to know, while a nice guy, was not suited for the presidency,"" said one Republican familiar with the conversations. ""That was not kept a secret. He was pretty comfortable telling people that. Major donors, other governors and the like. That quickly got back to Perry."" Perry's team chafed at the way Christie handled his endorsement process, in which the GOP candidates were summoned to Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's residence, to dine with Christie and his top aides in hopes of winning his support. One veteran of Perry's campaign described the ritual as ""imperial."" Perry never made the trip. When Christie ultimately endorsed Romney just hours before a debate in New Hampshire, no one bothered to give a simple courtesy call to Perry-world, the former campaign aide said. After his presidential race concluded, a chastened Perry returned to Austin and began dabbling in governors association business again. According to Christie sympathizers, he discovered that his once-rising star had been eclipsed by a younger set of governors, chief among them the ambitious Christie. ""Perry had gotten used to being everyone's favorite governor,"" said one GOP strategist who works with the committee. ""Everyone loved the guy and he could raise a lot of money. And he took it hard that it didn't translate to presidential support. When he came back on the RGA scene, he showed up, and guess who everybody's favorite governor was? Chris Christie. A new guy with a lot of swagger and fundraising ability. And he was from New Jersey."" ""You can only have so many sheriffs in one town,"" the strategist added. Beyond the obvious political tensions -- both are headstrong politicians with room-filling personalities and White House ambitions in 2016 -- people close to both governors point to a complicated cultural gulf between the two men when asked about their fraught relationship. Perry not naturally drawn to Christie . Perry, the socially conservative son of north Texas ranchers who wears his evangelical faith on his sleeve, isn't naturally drawn to Christie, a lawyer raised in the shadow of New York City who wants Republicans to move beyond the conservative orthodoxies that have damaged the party's brand with swing voters. Christie is friendlier to the bumper crop of Republican governors who were elected in 2010, in particular Wisconsin's Scott Walker and New Mexico's Susana Martinez. Perry, who became governor nearly a decade before Christie, is notoriously close with Jindal, the current vice-chairman of the governors association who is thought to have his own presidential aspirations. ""Those two are like brothers,"" said the adviser to a Republican governor. ""They're always doing stuff together."" In  summer 2012, even before that November's presidential election, Christie began jockeying with Jindal to take over the chairmanship of the governors association in 2014, a prime election year post that would give one of them a coveted launchpad for a potential White House bid. Perry actively worked to support Jindal. But after an unusually furious bout of behind-the-scenes campaigning, Christie won the prized post, thanks largely to his star power on the fundraising circuit. Jindal agreed to serve as governors association chairman in 2013. But the Christie-Perry rift was exposed again last November when Christie, the soon-to-be-anointed governors association chairman, moved to install Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on the governors association's executive committee. Word of Christie's maneuvering frustrated Jindal, the outgoing chairman, who had wanted to give the open spot to Perry, in part because of the Texan's fundraising prowess. ""Perry got wind of this, got pissed, and started calling all these governors,"" said one Republican consultant who witnessed the intense executive committee campaign that soon followed. Another operative familiar with the incident said: ""Why keep a governor who has been the most prolific fundraiser in the history of the governors association and from a huge donor state off the executive committee? It was strictly a power play by Christie."" As Perry supporters tell it, Perry outworked Christie on the phones and whipped up enough support among his fellow governors to force Christie into a compromise: The governors association agreed to add a slot on the executive committee so that both Perry and Pence could serve. Christie allies have a different take: The governor simply agreed to give both Perry and Pence executive committee posts to avoid an unnecessary flame war inside the organization. ""The whole executive committee thing was very overblown,"" said a governors association source when asked about the conflict. ""Once Christie figured out Perry wanted to be on board, he allowed him to be on board. And all the governors were happy with it."" As for the greater friction between Christie and Perry, the governors association source acknowledged some ill will but said the two Republicans have an amicable relationship. ""There may be some hangover from Christie endorsing Romney, but Christie respects Perry and his work as governor, and was happy to recommend him to join the executive committee,"" the source said.","Rick Perry's dismissal of Chris Christie's big win in November belies a deep resentment .

"(CNN) -- Former New Hampshire Attorney General Kelly Ayotte has squeezed out a narrow GOP Senate primary win over conservative challenger Ovide Lamontagne, the New Hampshire secretary of state's office declared Wednesday. Ayotte, the favorite among establishment Republicans, held less than a 1,000-vote lead over Lamontagne, a Manchester attorney and the 1996 Republican nominee for governor, with 85 percent of precincts counted, AP reported. The difference is less than 1 percent of the vote. The New Hampshire race didn't grab the national spotlight like the Republican Senate primary in Delaware -- where the more conservative challenger won -- but shared a similar storyline. Ayotte stepped down from the attorney general's office to run for the Senate nomination after being encouraged to run for the open seat by national Republicans. For months, polls suggested that Ayotte was the frontrunner in the seven-candidate contest, which also included businessmen Bill Binnie and Jim Bender. But recent surveys in the Granite State indicated that Lamontagne had narrowed the gap with Ayotte. Local Tea Party groups, the conservative New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper and influential conservative Sen. Jim DeMint all backed Lamontagne. The Union Leader, the state's largest paper, has also been critical of Ayotte. But the biggest difference with the Delaware race was that Sarah Palin endorsed the more conservative Christine O'Donnell there. In New Hampshire, the former Alaska governor backed Ayotte. In a robo-call, Palin called Ayotte a ""Granite Grizzly"" and added that ""she's the true conservative running for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire."" Palin's endorsement earlier this summer and Ayotte's support by many national Republicans may have backfired in fiercely independent New Hampshire. The moves drew repeated criticism from the Union Leader. In Monday's editorial, titled ""Beliefs trump D.C. dictates,"" the newspaper's publisher argued that Lamontagne ""has rallied New Hampshire grassroots conservatives while Ayotte has attracted the big-name, let's-be-moderate types who want a candidate who will move to the squishy middle in November."" The winner of November's general election will succeed retiring Republican Sen. Judd Gregg. CNN's Mark Preston contributed to this report.","NEW: Kelly Ayotte narrowly defeats Ovide Lamontagne .

"The number of people who say that acts of terrorism are likely to occur around the anniversary of 9/11 has significantly increased from three years ago. A new CNN/ORC International survey indicates that 53% of Americans believe it's likely for acts of terrorism to take place at this time, up from 39% in 2011 during the 10th anniversary of the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. ""It's likely that the change is due to newfound concerns over ISIS, which seven in 10 Americans believe has operatives within the U.S. able to commit an act of terrorism at any time,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. The poll results come as President Barack Obama addresses the public Wednesday night on the threat of ISIS and lays out his strategy to combat the militant group in Syria and Iraq. 10 questions for Obama on ISIS .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's top opposition movement welcomed the U.N. Security Council's call for a transfer of power, an initiative that could end the political instability in the poverty-ridden Arab nation. Mohammed Qahtan, the spokesman for the Joint Meeting Parties, said on Wednesday that the international stance must not be different from the will of the people who are seeking democracy and reforms. ""The U.N. and our international friends must make positive and quick steps towards the Yemeni revolution and ensure change in the manner Yemenis see necessary,"" said Qahtan. The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday urged Yemeni parties ""to move forward urgently (in) an inclusive, orderly and Yemeni-led process of political transition that meets the needs and aspirations of the Yemeni people for change."" It voiced concerns over the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Yemen. They were ""deeply concerned at the worsening security situation, including the threat from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula."" Yemen has endured months of protests and militant violence. Protests against President Ali Abdullah Saleh began in January after the successful uprising in Tunisia that triggered region-wide reform movements. The protests led to open street battles after Saleh balked at a deal with the opposition that would have eased him out of office within a month. The government has also faced off with Islamic militants, including the al Qaeda wing in Yemen, regarded by analysts as a potent and dangerous group. Saleh was badly injured last June in an assassination attempt on the presidential palace amid a tribal revolt against his 32-year-old rule and was taken to Saudi Arabia for treatment. He had been discharged from a military hospital, but it was not clear when he would return to Yemen. Saleh's vice president, Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, has been running the government since then. The opposition has vowed to prevent Saleh from returning. The JMP has announced the formation of a national council on August 17 to represent all the factions in the Yemeni political arena. That's a step experts see as a beginning to the formation of an independent transitional government. ""The JMP has been patient with the slow international reaction towards the Yemeni revolution and is not willing to stay quiet any longer,"" said Ali Abdul Jabbar, director of the Sana'a based Dar Ashraf Research Center. He said that the JMP is currently under immense pressure from the pro-democracy youth to cut all channels of dialogue with the regime. ""The youth have been patient and ignored for six months. The JMP saw the international community had enough time to demand change but failed."" But Mohammed Nagi Shaef, head of Bakeel confederation,Yemen's biggest tribe, and senior member of the ruling General People Congress party, said that Yemeni tribes will not allow the international community to force Saleh into early elections or withdraw from power . He said that tribal leaders have called on all Saleh's supporters nationwide to come to the capital and protest in front of the presidential palace, demanding that the international community allow Saleh back in Yemen. ""President Saleh's term ends in 2013, and we will not allow him to leave before that period at any cost. This is what the Yemeni constitution says and this is what will happen,"" said Shaef. However, Hameed al-Ahmar, the president of the opposition dialogue committee, said world powers should listen to the voice of the people to ensure safety and stability in the region. The United Nations, the United States and the European Union ""are clearly standing with the will of the Yemeni people for change. This is what Yemenis were waiting for all along,"" said al-Ahmar. ""This is what we expected from the U.S. and the international community and we hope it continues,"" al-Ahmar said.","The Security Council calls for an ""orderly"" transition .

"Ours is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. It may be time to add turned over to the people, too -- if the volunteerism of a few kind people, companies and philanthropies is any indication. As conflict between Congress and the White House has wrought a partial government shutdown, several big-hearted individuals and organizations have stepped forward with time and cash to provide services that Uncle Sam now can't. Death benefits . It is called the ultimate sacrifice, but a soldier giving his or her life for the United States wasn't prompting the Pentagon to deliver benefits to surviving family members. So, stepping in is an organization that few Americans outside the military had heard of until now: the Fisher House Foundation. The charity operates 62 residences for injured service members and has served 180,000 military families since 1990. It is now guaranteeing surviving relatives ""the full set of benefits they have been promised, including a $100,000 death gratuity payment,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said. In the meantime, Congress is finalizing an agreement to resume paying survivor benefits, including the $100,000 payment. $5 gift cards . An East Coast grocery chain on Thursday began distributing $500,000 worth of $5 gift cards to food banks in three cities in North Carolina because the pantries expect long lines in the wake of a suspended federal program serving low-income pregnant women and new mothers with children under age 5. The suspended federal aid is part of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, called WIC. The food banks can give the $5 gift cards -- redeemable at Food Lion stores -- to any family in need, said company spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown. Food Lion has 1,100 stores in 10 Eastern states. ""I'm heading right now to the Charlotte food banks,"" Phillips-Brown said on Thursday afternoon. The other cities to receive the gift cards will be Raleigh and Winston-Salem, she said. ""This is important to us because we don't want families having to choose between paying rent or buying baby formula,"" she said. Impoverished preschoolers . It took a billionaire couple to keep Head Start classrooms open for 7,000 low-income children in six states. Laura and John Arnold are giving $10 million to ensure the early childhood education program remains open in Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Mississippi. Head Start provides schooling to 1 million low-income U.S. children under age 5 in an effort to prepare them for kindergarten and subsequent grades. When Head Start programs close, parents often miss work or must find alternative care for their children. The nonprofit Head Start Association said it will repay the Arnolds if the government, after the shutdown, provides funding to keep programs operational for a year. Feeding the furloughed . A food bank is coming to the rescue of more than 2,200 workers at one of the shuttered U.S. parks -- the Grand Canyon National Park -- as well as 1,200 employees in the private hospitality sector who depend on an open park for business. Non-mandated federal employees don't have a paycheck. And workers in nearby hotels and restaurants are also hurt by the loss of tourism. So, the St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance in Phoenix has begun weekly distribution of emergency food boxes to workers strained by the Grand Canyon's shutdown. Beverly Damore, president and CEO of the alliance, recalled how one boy found a can of pork and beans in one box. He held it aloft ""like a prize,"" she said in a videotaped statement. ""He was holding it with joy on his face. He so clearly needed that food,"" Damore said. She has nevertheless been losing sleep because she didn't note the boy's name, or that of a couple who accepted food and promised to help the food bank when ""times are better,"" she said. ""I do not know how to make those folks in D.C. thousands of miles away stay sleepless with me because they also do not know these fine people,"" Damore said. Volunteer lawn mower . The Lincoln Memorial in Washington needed a landscaper, so Chris Cox of Charleston, South Carolina, brought a gas mower and trimmed the grass while holding his home state's flag. The other hand pushed the mower. The moment was captured on a CNN iReport video by passerby Darrel Stroman, who said: ""I get caught at the light and see a man cutting the grass at the Lincoln Memorial. I didn't know what was stranger at the moment -- the fact that he was cutting the lawn or that he was holding the South Carolina state flag while cutting. ""It was a very unusual moment,"" Stroman said. Police, however, halted the volunteer landscaper's activities. ""He was asked to leave and he did,"" said Sgt. Paul Brooks, spokesman for the U.S. Park Police. Cox was grateful that police didn't ticket or arrest him. Said Cox: ""'At the end of the day, the citizens are stewards of the memorials.""","A man carrying the South Carolina flag mows the lawn at Lincoln Memorial .

"(CNN) -- The man killed after he allegedly shot two women -- one fatally -- at a convenience store at Fort Bliss, Texas, was identified Tuesday as a retired Army sergeant. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said the motive for Monday's shootings is unclear. ""It has been determined this was an isolated criminal incident and not terrorism-related,"" the agency said. It was not known whether the shooter had any relationship with either of his victims. He was identified as Steven Kropf, 63, of El Paso, Texas. ""This is one disgruntled, deranged individual,"" said Maj. Gen. Dana Pittard, the post's commander. The two female victims were transported to Beaumont Army Medical Center, where one, Bettina Maria Goins, 44, of El Paso was pronounced dead. The unidentified wounded woman remained hospitalized with serious injuries. The gunman entered the busy Shopette Convenience Store on the post around 3 p.m. and shot the two civilian employees in a rear office. An Army guard shot Kropf, who had left the store and was in a vehicle in the store's parking lot, authorities said. Fort Bliss is located close to the Mexican border near El Paso, Texas, but straddles the Texas-New Mexico border. Most of the base is located in New Mexico, but the main headquarters is in Texas. President Barack Obama visited there last month to meet troops and mark the end of the official combat mission in Iraq. Agents Tuesday were interviewing witnesses and Army personnel. Although Fort Bliss is one of the safest Army installations, Pittard said, the post is ""going to take a good look at our privately owned weapons policies."" He indicated officers will conduct more random checks of motorists to see if they are bringing weapons.","NEW: General calls shooter ""disgruntled, deranged""

"Lakota warrior Crazy Horse has long been a controversial figure, so perhaps it's only appropriate that his memorial follow suit. Though he's best known for fighting against George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, Crazy Horse led his tribe numerous times against settlers and miners in the Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming and elsewhere before his 1877 death at Nebraska's Fort Robinson. But forget his disputed role in that battle or the claims that he's never been photographed or the conflicting tales of how he met his end -- the real mystery is more contemporary: When is the sculpture in his honor going to be complete? In the mountains of Black Hills, South Dakota, rests the Crazy Horse Memorial. It pays tribute to the Native American war hero with a sculpture that, at many times the size of nearby Mount Rushmore, will one day constitute the world's largest mountain carving. That is, if it ever gets completed. Though the project has been ongoing since 1948, it's far from finished, and there isn't a rush because ... well, there isn't a deadline. ""The organization is not trying to be difficult or using delaying tactics,"" said Patrick Dobbs, spokesman for the Crazy Horse Memorial. ""There are project unknowns and circumstances beyond control that influence the work."" He lists harsh weather -- including lightning storms and blizzards -- and the mountain's high iron content, which makes the rock tougher to carve, as factors that have put a halt on the sculpting progress. That's not to mention that the sculpture will stand 563 feet tall, a few feet higher than the Washington Monument. Creator shuns assistance . Another factor is funding. According to Dobbs, the Crazy Horse sculpture is a nonprofit project and is funded entirely by admission fees and donations. ""There were offers by elected government officials and high-ranking department appointees to seek funding as amendments to bills for other federal legislation,"" said Dobbs. ""However, (Polish sculptor) Korczak Ziolkowski turned them down. He did not believe the government would complete the carving."" Ziolkowski saw the American government as flaky when it came to making agreements, Dobbs said, adding Ziolkowski was dismayed by the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty, which handed the Black Hills over to the Lakota but required their children have an ""English education"" and failed to address gold rights, resulting in years of conflict. The government seized the Black Hills nine years later, and the ensuing court battles continued for more than a century. Dobbs said Ziolkowski was also troubled by Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum's struggle with federal officials over funding and control of the American landmark. Despite these factors that prompted Ziolkowski to spurn government assistance, it should be noted that Rushmore was completed after only 14 years. The New York Times reported in May that admission fees totaled $3.8 million in 2010, and the memorial received more than $19 million in donations over the last five years. Some Native Americans, including descendants of Crazy Horse, think with numbers like that the monument should already be finished. Seth Big Crow, whose great-grandmother was Crazy Horse's aunt, has mixed feelings about the memorial. In an interview with Voice of America, he said the monument could serve future generations and may be the American equivalent to the Easter Island monoliths. ""Maybe 300 or 400 years from now, everything will be gone, we'll all be gone, and they'll be the four faces in the Black Hills and the statue there symbolizing the Native Americans who were here at one time,"" Big Crow said. The Eastern Island monoliths have long been considered one of the world's great mysteries. Ancient Polynesian settlers to the island built the giant volcanic-stone figures, and while they are thought to pay homage to deities or ancestors, no one knows exactly what they represent. The sculpture of a lifetime . Ziolkowski began carving the Crazy Horse monument seven years after the completion of Rushmore. Chief Henry Standing Bear, then-leader of the Lakota tribe, didn't like the four huge American faces peering over his people's land, so he asked Ziolkowski if he could carve a monument in honor of a Native American legend. ""My fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red man has great heroes also,"" Standing Bear wrote in a 1939 letter to Ziolkowski. Ziolkowski worked on the carving until his death in 1982 at age 74. His dying wish was for his wife Ruth, now 86, and their 10 children to finish the sculpture. Ruth is president and CEO of the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation, and seven of the children are working on it to this day. Not everyone considers the sculpture an honor. In an interview with Voice of America, Elaine Quiver, another descendant of Crazy Horse, said Standing Bear had no right to order the monument. ""They don't respect our culture because we didn't give permission for someone to carve the sacred Black Hills where our burial grounds are,"" Quiver said. ""They were there for us to enjoy and they were there for us to pray. But it wasn't meant to be carved into images, which is very wrong for all of us. The more I think about it, the more it's a desecration of our Indian culture. Not just Crazy Horse, but all of us."" Tim Giago, founder of the Native Sun News, which is based in nearby Rapid City, told The New York Times he has never heard ""a single Native American say, 'I'm proud of that mountain.' "" There's also disagreement over the depiction of Crazy Horse's face. Though it's a source of some dispute, many experts say there are no known photographs of Crazy Horse, and thus, creating a statue in his likeness is foolish. However, according to a biography provided by the Crazy Horse Memorial, the statue is not meant to be a rendition of Crazy Horse. Instead, it's supposed to honor the spirit of Crazy Horse. Growing popularity? Dobbs acknowledges that the ""significance of the Crazy Horse Memorial and reaction to the mountain carving varies"" among Native Americans. However, he feels as though the perception of the mountain is getting better. ""The growth of the memorial's tribal flag collection to more than 120 banners from American and Canadian tribes and groups indicates spreading popularity for Crazy Horse,"" said Dobbs. ""The extent of applications for the limited openings in the summer university program is another indicator of support."" The tribal flags are given to the memorial as a sign of respect from the nation represented by the flag. It's also a sign of ""continuing support of the ongoing project,"" Dobbs said. Wanda McFaggen of the St. Croix Chippewa Indians, which sent their flag to the Crazy Horse monument, praised the memorial for its historical significance. ""We believe that education is a vital tool in helping the non-native communities understand who we are,"" said McFaggen, director of the tribe's historic preservation department. ""It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the efforts being made by the Korczak Ziolkowski family, and we are grateful for their passion for all of us as Native American people."" The mountain also features other attractions besides the carving that ""preserve"" the Native American tradition, Dobbs said. There is the Indian Museum of North America, which contains more than 11,000 historic and contemporary objects and artworks from tribal groups; the Native American Educational and Cultural Center, which houses a collection of historic prints, numerous regional artifacts and some hands-on activity displays; and the recently opened Indian University of North America, which partners with the University of South Dakota and offers courses in Native American studies. The Crazy Horse Memorial ""anticipates continued expansion of the Indian University of North America to include a medical training center, further development of the Indian Museum of North America and growth in its educational programs to enhance understanding of the varied Native American cultures,"" Dobbs said. However, Big Crow feels like the money being spent on these buildings should be used solely on the statue. ""When you start making money rather than to try to complete the project, that's when, to me, it's going off in the wrong direction,"" Big Crow said in the Voice of America interview. 'A project that will never end ...' But the Ziolkowskis have always insisted that this be a painstaking process -- ""so you do it right"" -- and the memorial website flatly states the memorial ""is a project that will never end, even after the mountain carving is complete."" After 50 years of work, Crazy Horse's 87-foot head was completed in 1998, and work is presently being done to finish 219-foot-tall head of the Native American warrior's steed, according to the Ziolkowskis. When and if it's complete, the entire monument will be 641 feet wide. In terms of size, Mount Rushmore, just 17 miles away, has four 60-foot heads, all of which can fit inside the lone head of Crazy Horse. Crazy Horse died after being captured by enemy soldiers. As with most Crazy Horse-related lore, the exact time and manner of death are disputed, and even a highway sign near Wounded Knee, South Dakota, lists four possible resting places.","Work on Crazy Horse Memorial began in 1948; it's unclear when sculpture will be complete .

"(CNN) -- The adoptive mother of a Florida girl found dead in a plastic bag in her husband's truck has been charged with first-degree murder, police said Saturday. Carmen Barahona also faces seven counts of aggravated child abuse and seven counts of child neglect, the Miami-Dade Police Department said in a press release. Authorities have said Jorge Barahona -- the 10-year-old girl's adoptive father and Carmen's husband -- parked his pest control truck alongside I-95 on February 14. A roadside ranger said he found Barahona beside the truck and his adopted son ill inside the vehicle, which was filled with toxic chemicals. The boy was taken to a hospital to be treated for severe burns. The body of his adopted daughter, Nubia -- who is the boy's twin sister -- was later discovered in the back of the truck in a plastic bag. Four days later, Jorge Barahona pleaded not guilty on charges of attempted first-degree murder with a weapon and aggravated child abuse with a weapon in the case. At least two people tried to warn authorities about alleged abuse of the twins. In one instance, a caller told Florida authorities that he knew Jorge and Carmen Barahona, and he was worried about the couple's twins. The contents of that phone call, which was made two days before the twins were found, was released this week by the Florida Department of Children and Families. The caller said he was worried that something sinister had happened to the 10-year-old girl because Jorge and Carmen Barahona could not explain where the girl was. ""(Jorge Barahona) doesn't come out with a straight answer which is worrying me so much that something might have happened to that little girl,"" said the caller, who was not named. Four days before the twins were found, a therapist told authorities that the children are ""taped up ... and put in a bathtub,"" according to another abuse hotline call also released this week. ""They are in there, all day and all night,"" said the therapist, who was not named. An independent panel has been asked to investigate the actions of Florida's child protection system in the case. The Miami-Dade Police Department said Saturday that ""this continues to be active investigation,"" adding that a press briefing is scheduled for Monday.","Carmen Barahona has been charged with first-degree murder, police say .

The Facebook Gorge and Twitter Triangle are particularly nefarious time-sucks. Restraint is advised. Up ahead is Hyperbole Junction, which is the Worst. Spot. Ever. We recommend that you maintain an even keel and stay to the center; the extreme left and right can be dangerous. And over there is the infamous Lair of Sociopaths, the home of trolls and loners who mercilessly mock everyone who enters their territory. Watch your step: They may trip you up and you'll fall into the Chasm of Lulz. Our world isn't all dangerous, of course. You may visit Squee City, where images of cute cats and laughing babies fill the landscape. You'll also meet countless kind strangers, hilarious raconteurs and hard-working fact-checkers. They make it all worthwhile. Hmm. Maybe it would be easier if you had a guide -- you know, some rules to help you find your way. What, you didn't know there are rules of the Internet? Of course there are rules. How do you think we maintain order around here? A parody of rules . That's a joke. But there really are some rules of the Internet -- even if they, too, began as kind of a joke. According to the site KnowYourMeme.com, the Rules began around 2006 as a guide for the Internet collective Anonymous and emerged on the old Encyclopedia Dramatica, a bawdy meme catalog. Soon a version emerged on 4chan, an online bulletin board where most users post anonymously, says Jamie Cohen, director of web/digital media at Hofstra University's School of Communication. ""Chris Poole (4chan's founder) kind of designed it, kind of like a Netiquette rules,"" he says, describing the unspoken code of conduct that lubricates Internet discourse. (Poole has attributed the rules to Gaia Online, a role-playing community.) But the rules of the Internet deliberately mocked many of those conventions. The self-reflexive parody fit perfectly with its community's attitude, points out Anthony Rotolo, a professor at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies. ""These jokes are meant to comment on something happening in the world,"" he says. ""Later they get accepted as truisms or become a meme."" The absurdity has been reflected even in the supposed number of rules. Though the best-known first version claimed there were 50 rules, only 18 were listed. Number 1 was initially ""Do not talk about Rules 2-33""; no Rules 2-33 were on the list. The sarcastic attitude was reinforced by the kicker found on Encyclopedia Dramatica. It was a parody of Wikipedia's stub language: ""This article is crap. You can help by completely re-writing it."" 'Fight Club' and Monty Python . Very quickly, the lists started multiplying and expanding, liberally borrowing from comedy, Web culture and math-science tropes. On one list, a few were designated by complex numbers and mathematical symbols. Some were observations; others were directives. Two rules were taken from ""Fight Club"": ""You do not talk about 4chan (or ""/b/,"" 4chan's random, free-wheeling bulletin board) and ""You DO NOT talk about 4chan."" One version of Rule 6 stated ""There is no Rule 6,"" which is from a Monty Python sketch.   Rule 42, ""Always bring a towel,"" was drawn from Douglas Adams' ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" series. (If you have to ask, read the books.) ""Profit,"" Rule 49, came from ""South Park."" Other rules went the reverse direction and became part of mainstream culture. Rule 34 -- ""If it exists, there is porn of it"" -- is likely the most famous. But there's also ""Pics or it didn't happen"" (Rule 30), ""For every given male character, there is a female version of that character; conversely for every given female character, there is a male version of that character"" (Rule 63) and, of course, the corollary to Rule 34 -- ""If no porn of it exists at the moment, it will be made"" (Rule 35). Most retained a sense of humor, riffing off established rules and occasionally ending with a giggly ""No exceptions."" But a handful were, and remain, as serious as a judge -- notably the three directly about Anonymous (commonly Rules 3-5): . -We are Anonymous. -We are legion. -We do not forgive, we do not forget. The overall Internet rules may have started as a joke, but such ominous language from Anonymous speaks to some of the paradoxes of the Web: . Rules? Why do we need some stinkin' rules? After all, rules can be helpful -- or divisive. They can create community -- or subvert it. Even Anonymous, the activist group itself, cuts both ways, says Rotolo. When it hacked the extremist Westboro Baptist Church, many people cheered. But when it goes after less unpopular targets, some cry vigilantism. Cohen says that the rules themselves try to have it both ways. They're funny until someone gets hurt. They ""play more of a game type of role. They can be bent or broken or cheated or moved around, as you would in any game that has no physical reaction,"" he says. ""That doesn't take into account ever the result of real people being affected by this -- such as teenagers, children, anybody who's seeing things that they shouldn't."" He adds, ""There's a lot of rules in there that work for (the creators) more than anyone else. Until they become victims of their own thing, they don't know how powerful the rules are."" Evolving from the Wild West . Of course, the Internet isn't that old, and we're still in its Wild West era in many ways. As the technology evolves from a handful of hackers on Usenet bulletin boards to billions of users on officially sponsored sites, the customs -- the rules -- of the Web will evolve with it. But we're not talking about the kinds of changes that your family makes to the rules of Monopoly (no, Free Parking is NOT for the pool of money acquired via Chance and Community Chest). We're talking something more expansive: All the established customs of our carbon-based life forms, making way for the instantaneous and virtual modes of silicon-based electronics. Who knows what new rules may be written? ""When you're in the midst of social change, it's impossible to determine where it's going,"" says Peter S. Vogel, a former programmer who's now a Dallas-based attorney. ""And I think we are in the greatest social change in the history of humans, because there are no boundaries of geography or time."" We haven't even sorted out what happens when the differences in local culture meet global technology. Bruce Umbaugh, a philosophy professor at Webster University in St. Louis who teaches a course on philosophy and technology, argues that not all parts of the world are as tolerant or open-minded as Western democracies. ""There are a lot of other places in the world that are actively using the technology of the Internet to control the free communication among citizens, and to identify critics of the government and hurt them,"" he says. ""We need to be mindful in what we advocate from our perspective that the tools that are implemented on the Net are tools for the global Net."" In other words, citizens of other countries already face actual, enforceable rules -- unlike the folkways established by Web users  in the West. Witness the frictions of the Arab Spring, or the restrictions of societies such as North Korea. It's the kind of perspective that provides a different context for the issues raised by a libertarian, anything-goes Internet. It's hard enough to stop ""Star Wars"" comment boards from devolving into flamebaiting, meme-generating files of NSFW Yodas. So for now, we're still making our way through the Series of Tubes, and nobody knows where the boundaries lie. We joke, we grimace and we marvel at the creativity of the hive mind.  The Internet is a big place, and countless cultures have set up residence. Eventually, what is now humor may lose its zing; what are now customs may become laws. Will the rules ever become The Rules? Maybe some future generation will figure out the true guideposts of Internet life, and the singularity will be upon us. Nah. It'll never happen. What did we miss? Share your rules for the internet below in the comments. We'll feature some of the best on CNN.","Yes, there ARE some rules to the Internet, though, for now they're mainly an inside joke .

"President Barack Obama congratulated Michael Sam on Saturday for being the first openly gay football player taken in the National Football League draft,  the White House said in a statement. ""From the playing field to the corporate boardroom, LGBT Americans prove everyday that you should be judged by what you do and not who you are,"" Obama said. He also congratulated the NFL and the St. Louis Rams, the team that drafted Sam. Sam, an All-American defensive end who played for the University of Missouri, made history when he was picked by the Rams in the seventh and final round. He was the 249th of 256 players selected. The 24-year-old got the news by telephone from Rams' coach Jeff Fisher, who told Sam: ""You are a Ram. The wait is finally over."" Sam, who was filmed by ESPN as he got the call, broke down in tears in the arms of his boyfriend. ""Thank you,"" he could be heard saying to Fisher. Later, Sam took to Twitter to post a picture of himself, smiling. ""Thank you to the St. Louis Rams and the whole city of St. Louis,"" he said in the post. ""I'm using every (ounce) of this to achieve greatness!!"" See Sam's reaction . St. Louis is only a two-hour drive from Columbia, home of the University of Missouri, where Sam starred. Besides being a first-team All-American, the 6-foot-2, 260-pounder was named the co-defensive player of the year in the Southeastern Conference, widely considered college football's best league. His fellow Tigers named him the team's most valuable player. With those credentials, Sam was expected to be selected, but as the three-day draft wore on, there were questions whether he would. Fisher told ESPN that Sam was a player who was rated by the team as going much higher in the draft. ""We weren't going to miss the opportunity to add an outstanding player to our roster,"" he said. In February, Sam came out in interviews with ESPN and The New York Times, a decision that raised questions about whether he had damaged his chances to play in the NFL. ""I came to tell the world I'm an openly proud gay man,"" he said in an interview with ESPN. Sam said he told his Missouri teammates in August and suffered no repercussions. He said he was surprised to discover many people in the media already knew he was gay. ""I understand how big this is,"" Sam said in the ESPN interview. ""It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL."" Sam also spoke about his sexual orientation to The New York Times, saying: ""I just want to make sure I could tell my story the way I want to tell it. I just want to own my truth."" At the start of the draft on Thursday, it appeared it was also on Sam's mind. ""No matter what happen(s) these next few days, I will always cherish moments like this!!!,"" he said in a post on Twitter. Sam's draft was viewed as a barometer of whether the NFL was ready to accept an openly gay player. His selection is viewed as a bright spot for a league that has faced a host of criticism in recent months, from questions about the lack of minorities promoted to the number of players arrested for bad behavior. ""I think this is a good day, against the backdrop of what has happened in the NBA recently,"" Margaret Hoover, a political commentator and gay rights activist, told CNN. The NFL Players Association also weighed in on Sam's good news. ""We wish him the best of luck as we do all of the 2014 NFL Draft class,"" said George Atallah, the association's assistant executive director of external affairs. Other athletes have come out as gay, but they didn't have Sam's profile. Among them are the NBA's Jason Collins, the WNBA's Brittney Griner, WWE's Darren Young, UFC's Liz Carmouche, MMA's Fallon Fox and Major League Soccer's Robbie Rogers. Of those athletes, Collins made the biggest media splash. ""I think it's great. I'm looking forward to seeing him play,"" Collins, who plays for the Brooklyn Nets, told ESPN after the draft pick was announced. The road to football stardom was not an easy one for Sam, who graduated from Missouri in December. One of eight children, he grew up in Hitchcock, Texas, where he was raised primarily by his mother. At one point, he has said, he lived out of his mother's car and briefly stayed with another family. Three of Sam's siblings have died, including an older brother he saw die from a gunshot wound. Two of his brothers are serving prison sentences. Complete coverage: Rams pick Michael Sam . NFL draft winners and losers .","Obama also congratulated the NFL .

"Tests of an experimental Ebola vaccine began this week at the National Institutes of Health, amid mounting anxiety about the spread of the deadly virus in West Africa. On Thursday, a third volunteer will receive a dose of the vaccine. The first volunteer, a 39-year-old woman, received a dose Tuesday; the second volunteer, a 27-year-old woman, received her dose Wednesday. Seven more will be given the vaccine next week. The NIH hopes to have 20 volunteers enrolled and vaccinated within three weeks. After an expedited review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, researchers were given the green light to begin what's called a human safety trial, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID. It is the first test of this type of Ebola vaccine in humans. The experimental vaccine, developed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and the NIAID, is being given to the three healthy human volunteers at first to see if they suffer any adverse effects. If deemed safe, it will then be given to another small group of volunteers, ages 18 to 50, to see if it produces a strong immune response to the virus. All will be monitored closely for side effects. The vaccine will be administered to volunteers by an injection in the deltoid muscle of their arm, first in a lower dose, then later in a higher dose after the safety of the vaccine has been determined. Each volunteer is being paid approximately $1,700 for their time and inconvenience, the NIH said. The government agency expects to spend around $1.6 million on the trial overall. Some of the preclinical studies that are normally done on these types of vaccines were waived by the FDA during the expedited review, Fauci said, so ""we want to take extra special care that we go slowly with the dosing."" The vaccine did extremely well in earlier trials with chimpanzees, Fauci said. He noted that the method being used to prompt an immune response to Ebola cannot cause a healthy person to become infected with the virus. Still, he said, ""I have been fooled enough in my many years of experience ... you really can't predict what you will see (in humans)."" The NIH says the vaccine will also be tested on healthy volunteers in the United Kingdom, Gambia and Mali, once details are finalized with health officials in those countries. CDC director raises Ebola alarm . Trials cannot currently be done in the four countries affected by the recent outbreak -- Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria -- because the existing health care infrastructure wouldn't support them, Fauci said. Gambia and Mali were selected because the NIH has ""long-standing collaborative relationships"" with researchers in those countries. According to the NIH, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are also in talks with health officials from Nigeria about conducting part of the safety trial there. Funding from an international consortium formed to fight Ebola will enable GlaxoSmithKline to begin manufacturing up to 10,000 additional doses of the vaccine while clinical trials are ongoing, the pharmaceutical company said in a statement. These doses will be made available if the World Health Organization decides to allow emergency immunizations in high-risk communities. Two candidate vaccines . The GSK/NIAID vaccine is one of two leading candidate vaccines. The other was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed this month to NewLink Genetics, a company based in Iowa. According to the NIH, safety trials of that vaccine will start this fall. Ebola victim: 'I felt like I was about to die' Earlier this month, the Canadian government shipped what it said was ""800 to 1,000"" doses of that vaccine to Liberia, at the government's request. It's not clear whether it has been given to health workers or anyone else there. Worth noting: In 2009, an earlier version of the vaccine was given to a lab worker in Germany after he thought he had pricked himself with a needle tainted with Ebola. He did not develop the disease. While there is no proven treatment for Ebola beyond supportive care, government agencies and small biotechnology firms have been scrambling to speed up development of several potential therapies and vaccines. A third vaccine, also developed by the NIH, was recently tested in primates and found to protect them from infection; it was given in combination with Depovax, an adjuvant that has been used with other vaccines and cancer therapies to boost the body's immune response. Drugs for treatment of Ebola . While vaccines might be given to prevent infection among health workers or other people thought to be at high risk, development has also been sped up on drugs that might be given to patients who already have the disease. The drug that's received the most attention is ZMapp, which has been given to at least seven people in the current outbreak, including two American missionary medical workers, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly. The drug has never been formally tested in humans, and while the results in human patients are encouraging -- five of the seven known to have received it are still alive -- experts say there is too little data to say whether it played a role in their recoveries. Are myths making the Ebola outbreak worse? Earlier versions of ZMapp, which received backing from the U.S. and Canadian governments as well as from biotechnology firms, have shown some ability to protect rhesus macaque monkeys more than two days after they were infected with the virus. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday a $24.9 million, 18-month contract with ZMapp's manufacturer, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, to accelerate the development of the medication. Mapp will make ""a small amount of the drug for early stage clinical safety studies and nonclinical studies"" to gauge how the drug works on people, the HHS department said in a news release. The various new steps ""will contribute to increasing the amount of product potentially available to treat patients with Ebola."" Another drug, Tekmira's TKM-Ebola, has been tested for safety in a small number of humans. That trial was put on hold in January, after one volunteer developed moderate gastrointestinal side effects after receiving a high dose of the medication. Last month, the FDA modified the hold to a ""partial clinical hold."" In effect, this means that Tekmira could be allowed to give the drug to doctors or hospitals that request it, on an emergency basis. There's no indication that the company has received any such requests. The vaccine going into trials this week is based on an adenovirus -- a type of cold virus -- that's found in chimpanzees. The virus delivers genetic material derived from two species of Ebola virus, including the Zaire strain that's responsible for the current outbreak. Those genes are meant to trigger the development of antibodies in the person who receives the vaccine, antibodies that can specifically defend against Ebola. Another trial, using a version of the GSK/NIAID vaccine that uses only the Zaire strain of Ebola, will be launched in October, the NIH said. All participants in the trial will be evaluated nine times over a 48-week period. The NIH expects to reveal the results of the trial by the end of the year. If it's approved for widespread use, the first priority will be to give the vaccine to health care workers or lab workers who are fighting the spread of the virus, Fauci said. It will then be considered for people in the communities where outbreaks occur. Nine things to know about the killer disease .

"The politics of health care is changing fast. President Barack Obama's Affordable Health Care Act was vulnerable during his first term when Republicans demanded repeal of the law. Even after the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality, there were still many voices who objected to it. However, with each passing day, it appears that the program is in good shape, slowly becoming part of the fabric of American government. Last week, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, one of the main potential contenders for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, said that his state would accept the Medicaid expansion that is part of the ACA. Christie had been one of the president's toughest critics, frequently lambasting the program as a prime example of big government liberalism. But he has changed his tune. The expansion of Medicaid will allow about 104,000 of the poorest residents in New Jersey to gain access to health insurance. Christie said: ""Let me be clear: I am no fan of the Affordable Health Care Act. I think it is wrong for New Jersey and for America. I fought against it and believe, in the long run, it will not achieve what it promises. However, it is now the law of the land. I will make all my judgments as governor based on what is best for New Jerseyans."" Christie's announcement comes on top of an even more dramatic reversal, that of Florida's Gov. Rick Scott. The former health industry executive, who was elected to lead the Sunshine State in 2010, has been one of the more conservative voices in the GOP. Scott, who once warned that ""Obamacare will result in the rationing of health care, significant tax increases, significant job losses and the inability of many Americans to keep their existing health insurance"" also announced that Florida would accept the new Medicaid funds. ""When the federal government is committed to paying 100% of the cost,"" Scott said, ""I cannot, in good conscience, deny Floridians that need access to health care."" Fewer Republicans are interested in fighting against the ACA any more. Not only is it a losing issue, but in the next few years, the benefits are going to start rolling in and more Americans will come to depend on the protections. The shift in position by two of the most prominent Republicans suggests that the political dynamics are shifting, as Obama's supporters had always hoped. Republican officials now see powerful incentives for them to embrace the law rather than oppose it. The biggest watershed moment for the ACA came in June 2012 when the Supreme Court ruled that the health care legislation was constitutional. Like in 1937, when the Supreme Court declared that the Social Security tax was constitutional, the court's ruling on health care gave Obama's program a legitimacy that undercut some of the thunder coming from the right. The Affordable Care Act became law of the land. Then the 2012 presidential election was an affirmation of popular support for Obama and the policies for which he fought. It's not unusual for a big piece of legislation to elicit strong oppositions at first. With Social Security, the program experienced over a decade of uncertainty. A means tested program for the elderly proved much more popular during the 1940s, and Congress refused to raise Social Security taxes during World War II. But by the early 1950s, Social Security emerged as the primary means of helping the elderly. As more Americans were receiving their checks, fewer politicians in either party opposed the program. President Dwight Eisenhower concluded that the GOP had little choice but to accept the program. Republicans and Democrats, including Southern Democrats, voted to increase benefits every two years. By the 1980s, Social Security would be considered to be the ""third rail"" in American politics -- touch the benefits and you die. Similarly, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 experienced strong reactions. The notion of prohibiting racial segregation was incredibly contentious. But once Congress passed it, Southern politicians, citizens and institutions quickly fell in line. In the 1970s and 1980s, issues such as affirmative action and school busing still riled up many, but de jure racial segregation was no longer considered acceptable by most. More recently, during President George W. Bush's presidency, the new counterterrorism programs provoked heated debates. Democrats railed against the tough interrogation techniques used by the government to combat terrorism and highlighted institutions such as Guantanamo as symbols of what the nation was doing wrong. But Obama abandoned many of his plans to dismantle these programs. His nomination of John Brennan to head the CIA and the protection of key documents that allegedly support the assassination of American citizens reveal how much the tide has turned. Today, there is considerable evidence that the health care law is approaching that turning point. As Ezra Klein wrote in The Washington Post, ""so long as Obamacare is accepted as the law of the land, and repeal is dismissed by most Republicans as little more than a pleasant fantasy, then a constructive process can begin in which Republicans seize on problems with the law as an opportunity to reform the reforms -- and through that process, begin to buy into the new system."" There is still a lot of work that needs to be done, such as making sure that the health care exchanges work and that funding for the program remains adequate. The program's success is not inevitable. But the recent change of heart from the darlings of the Republican Party is an indication the ACA is much further along to becoming one of the most important legacies of the Obama presidency.","Julian Zelizer: The politics of health care is changing fast .

"It's a formula that's been tried and tested in countless erotic novels in recent memory. A rich, handsome man charms a young innocent with lavish gifts and bold declarations of desire. With a smoldering gaze, he melts her insides, turns her legs to jelly and paralyzes her subconscious, paving the way for hot sex scenes while she attempts to crack his steely veneer. Formulaic as it is, E.L. James' ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" trilogy is poised to become one of the fastest-selling series in recent years, with 20 million copies sold in the United States and 31 million worldwide since March. Movie rights are spoken for, and in addition to becoming the subject of online parodies, a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch, a musical and hotel marketing gimmicks, the S&M-flavored love story of a recent college grad and a billionaire CEO is also credited with boosting sales of sex toys, driving women to hook-up sites and fueling a craze over sexual domination. What's behind the trilogy's runaway success? The books hit the romance novel scene at just the right moment, insiders say, riding a wave of smart marketing and benefiting from the erotica world's e-book savvy. Plus, if the plot and characters sounds a bit like ""Twilight"" fan fiction, it's because they're modeled after them. The most potent (and obvious) factor is that sex sells, and kinky romances like ""Fifty Shades"" are sating women's lust for erotica-lite, said Jaclyn Friedman, author of ""What You Really Really Want: The Smart Girl's Shame-Free Guide to Sex & Safety."" ""The popularity of 'Fifty Shades' speaks to the fact that the dominant model of mainstream pornography and ideas of sex are targeted at men. The fantasy starts when he's into it and ends when he's done,"" she said. ""A lot of women have said that they've learned the most about what sex could be for them from erotica novels,"" she said. ""These stories focus on female desire and what's in it for the woman, and there's not a lot of that in mainstream culture."" Whatever the case, sex has long been selling erotic tales, earning spots on best-seller lists and testing attitudes toward sexuality. The heroine in French author Pauline Reage's ""Story of O"" consented to being whipped and branded more than 50 years before Anastasia Steele signed Christian Grey's non-disclosure agreement and terms for becoming his submissive in ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" Casting 'Fifty Shades of Grey' In the interim, dozens of erotic romance novels by authors such as Eden Bradley, Sylvia Day and Megan Hart have landed on best-seller lists, firmly establishing the genre as a major player in the publishing industry. Romance readers, known for their voracious literary appetites, were among the first adopters of e-books, said Michelle Renaud, spokeswoman for publisher Harlequin, which has been carrying erotic novels since 2006. ""They love to consume many novels at once, and e-books are an easy way to carry them around."" The ""Fifty Shades"" books were originally released as e-books by the Writers Coffee Shop, an independent publisher based in Australia. They were instant hits, drawing attention of fans and Vintage Books, which acquired the rights in March and published them as e-books first and then as paperbacks. "" 'Fifty Shades' is no different from what's already being sold. The major difference is that it has somehow become a part of current pop culture, of the zeitgeist. People won't stop talking about it, so it perpetuates the sales, perpetuates the mythos, of this work as some sort of watershed for erotic fiction,"" said Mala Bhattacharjee, features editor of RT Book Reviews, the pioneering literary review journal formerly known as Romantic Times. ""In truth, romance fiction and erotica have been this 'naughty' for decades — naughtier, even!"" she said in an e-mail. ""In essence, it's the phenomenon of FSOG that has snowballed its popularity for readers more than the actual text."" RT Books: Undercover Erotica . If so, much of the success of the ""Fifty Shades"" trilogy may simply reside in its packaging. After acquiring English rights in March, Vintage Books released digital editions of all three books, followed by print versions in April featuring relatively tame covers compared with bodice-rippers of yore. Where one might expect two milky bodies intertwined, the covers of books one and two feature a gray silk tie and a bedazzled face mask. ""We felt that discreet, tasteful covers certainly would being in new readers who may not have bought the books with more explicit covers,"" Vintage Books spokesman Russell Perreault said. The formula seems to have paid off, and since then, the romance industry has been keen to reap the benefits of judging a book by its cover. Not long after the series took off, Harlequin and other publishers began reissuing old titles with toned-down covers. ""What may have tipped the scale for the 'Fifty Shades' trilogy in particular are the nondescript covers. For whatever reason, the classic 'clinch' covers on a lot of romance novels tend to carry a stigma of being 'old-fashioned,' so the covers on 'Fifty Shades' may have made the books more approachable for a larger range or readers,"" RT Book Reviews Editor Audrey Goodson said. ""Certainly, there are some who might prefer to read romance on the privacy of an e-reader, but what's really refreshing for me to see is the large number of women reading 'Fifty Shades' on the subway and at the coffee shop. It simply proves that while covers may play some role in readers' preferences, it's what's between the covers that really counts."" Updating a cover isn't new either, but using ""iconic"" or ""object"" imagery picked up speed a few months back in an effort to capture the momentum of ""Fifty Shades."" ""It sends a visible signal that if you liked 'Fifty Shades,' there are other titles you'll like,"" said Monique Patterson, executive editor with St. Martin's Press, which is reissuing titles by best-selling authors Lora Leigh, Laura Reese and Opal Carew with new covers this summer. ""Tastes tend to evolve and change over time with any product, not just books. As time goes on you, have to refresh and update your way of speaking to your audience."" Best-selling author Sylvia Day's first self-published title, ""Bared to You,"" entered the New York Times best-seller list in April despite its cover, which featured a profile shot of a naked woman with her arms wrapped across her breasts and a man on his knees, his face pressed into the small of her back. When Berkley Books took over the title in May, the cover art changed to an image of a pair of cufflinks. The title is No. 4 on the New York Times best-seller list, right behind the three ""Fifty Shades"" books, and can be found on bookshelves in Target next to ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" ""Many new readers have discovered erotic romance and want to read more, but the more explicit covers don't appeal to them,"" said Cindy Hwang, executive editor of Berkley Books. ""Publishers are smartly responding to the marketplace and adjusting the cover approach for some erotic romance titles. Cufflinks and keychains can be just as evocative as bare skin."" Day says she has received mixed reaction to the change from fans. Those who self-identify as avid readers and rely on cover art to identify the myriad subgenres within the romance category complained that the new cover obscured the novel's meaning. Others, however, welcomed the change and said it led them to finally purchase the book, where before, they didn't want to be seen carrying it around. "" 'Fifty Shades' readers and new readers of 'Bared to You' don't tend to self-identify as readers per se, and they want books they can take out in public, whereas romance readers don't care. They have adopted strategies over years, with e-books and book covers, and they'll go out with a book regardless of the cover,"" she said. ""For those who are getting back into reading with 'Fifty Shades' and 'Bared to You,' it's a very new thing they're stepping into, and they want it to be an easy transition."" E-books have also helped to ease the transition by offering newcomers to the genre a way to read in virtual anonymity, said Twanna A. Hines, a New York-based writer, sex educator and reproductive rights advocate.

""It's been parodied on 'SNL' and on the cover of Newsweek. Who wants to be left out of the conversation?"" she said. ""Plus, BDSM is appealing because while many Americans have heard of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and can tell you it's an erotic book, not as many can tell you what the letters BDSM stand for, so there's this allure, the siren call to find out more."" For the next few months, expect publishers to bet on that desire and reissue more BDSM titles from the past dressed up in scarves, leather belts and feathers until the next trend rolls around. ""You can't create a moment like this, because if you could, we'd do it all the time,"" said Patterson, of St. Martin's Press.

"And the winner is ... Yale. That was the selection made Wednesday by Kwasi Enin, the New York high school student accepted by the eight Ivy League schools -- Harvard, Yale, Brown, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Princeton and Cornell. He made his pick in style, staging a news conference in the gym of William Floyd High School and delivering the big announcement before teachers and members of the media. A visit to the New Haven, Connecticut, campus helped him decide. ""My Bull Dog Days experience last week was incredible,"" he said. ""I met geniuses from all across the world. And everyone there was so friendly and inviting. ... And I believe that their deep appreciation and love for music, like I have, was very critical for me deciding to go there."" His father, Ebenezer, thanked all those at the high school who encouraged his son. ""We are grateful for all the inspiration,"" he said. ""People think Kwasi is like an angel or somebody who was sheltered. Really, we gave him a lot of freedom, even though at the same time we were very strict with him in terms of academics and the way he behaved. ... We only pray that going forward he will stay focused and not be distracted."" Referring to Kwasi's 14-year-old sister, Adwoa, their father said: ""I told her, Look, I believe you can do better than him."" Enin scored 2250 out of a possible 2400 on his SAT, placing him in the 98th percentile across the country, according to The College Board. He's also ranked 11th in his class at William Floyd High School, a public school on Long Island, according to his principal, Barbara Butler. ""I applied knowing that going to any of the Ivy League schools would be wonderful,"" Enin told CNN earlier this month. ""I thought if I applied to all eight, I figured I'd get into one ... but from the first one onwards I said, 'This can't be happening!' I was shocked seeing all these acceptances under my name."" Butler said Enin is not only a model academic student, but also plays three instruments for the chamber orchestra, sings in an a cappella group, throws shot put and discus for the high school's track and field team, participates in student government and has had a lead role in school plays since the ninth grade. ""Usually kids are good athletes or good musicians or good actors, but they don't have all three and then on top add student government. It's a balancing act. He somehow finds time to do it all and then volunteer at a local hospital,"" Butler said. Butler has been Enin's principal for six years in both middle and high school. ""He is an incredibly modest, humble and respectable person,"" Butler said. ""He is incredibly dedicated and he has his priorities straight. He takes advantage of whatever opportunity he is afforded."" Rachel Rubin, the founder of Spark Admissions in Massachusetts, who also previously served on admissions committees at selective universities, said the feat is extremely rare. ""It's quite atypical,"" Rubin said, adding that most students do not apply to all the Ivy League schools. ""Standardized test scores and good grades will get a student in the door to have their application read,"" Rubin said. ""But it's their extracurricular activities, leadership experience, exceptional talents, recommendation letters and personal essays that will move a student from a pile of 'maybes' to a pile of 'accepted.' "" Harvard's acceptance rate, among the most selective in the country, was just 5.9% for the applicants for the class of 2017, according to its admissions site. Enin was also accepted to Duke University and three State University of New York campuses. Enin admitted all along that he favored Yale. ""I really liked their sense of family, relationships between undergraduates and professors, and the residential college,"" he said earlier this month. ""They also have a strong biomedical engineering program, which is a wonderful combination of biology and creative tools that doctors and health care professionals can use."" Enin added that Yale also has a strong music program, one of his beloved hobbies that he hopes to continue when he isn't hitting the books in college. He hopes to one day pursue medicine, a dream of his that just so happens to align with his parents' careers. His parents, who immigrated from Ghana in the late 1980s, are both nurses and pushed Enin to receive the highest grades possible and follow his dreams. ""Health care is a prominent field that satisfies people beyond finances and edifies people and is about moral development,"" he said. His advice for future applicants? ""Follow your passions in high school and not just follow suit for what you think can get you into these schools,"" he said. ""Develop your outside interests -- not just academics.""","Kwasi Enin, 17, considered all eight Ivy League schools and picked Yale .

"Amid the chaos and the grief, the politics and the finger pointing, we are no closer to answering some key questions about the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. The crash, which killed all 298 people aboard, has turned a volatile Ukrainian region into a global problem. Here are five questions we don't yet have the answers to. 1. Who shot down the plane? Only a full investigation can settle that. This much we know: Flight 17 was shot down using a surface-to-air missile in Ukrainian territory that's controlled by pro-Russian rebels. Ukraine's government says it has ""compelling evidence"" that a Russian-supplied battery, manned by Russian operatives, fired the missile. The United States has also pointed the finger at the Russian-trained rebels. ""We have a video showing a launcher moving back through a particular area there, out into Russia, with at least one missing missile on it,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. But Russia has denied any involvement. So have the rebels, who accuse the Ukrainians of downing the plane -- without offering proof. 2. Why would anyone target a passenger plane? If indeed the rebels are behind the attack, they may have mistaken Flight 17 for a Ukrainian military aircraft. In the past few months, the rebels have used surface-to-air missiles to bring down more than a dozen planes, including two transport aircraft, the U.S. Embassy in Kiev said. Shortly after the crash,  Igor Strelkov,  the self-proclaimed defense minister of the Donetsk People's Republic, claimed on social media that the rebels had shot down a military transport plane. Those posts were later deleted once it turned out the plane was a civilian aircraft. ""It has the earmarks of a mistaken identification of an aircraft that they may have believed was Ukrainian,"" Arizona Sen. John McCain told MSNBC. 3. Why was the plane flying over a war zone? Most airlines follow rules set by national civil aviation authorities and take the most direct route available, said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Malaysia Airlines flight left Amsterdam for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It flew over eastern Ukraine, which is a common route for international carriers. Last week, Eurocontrol, the agency responsible for coordinating European airspace, said Ukrainian authorities had closed airspace in the region below 32,000 feet (about 9,750 meters), but it was open at the level Flight 17 was flying (33,000 feet). ""There's a lot of questions to be asked in a lot of different places,"" CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. ""Why didn't government officials close off that airspace completely? 32,000 feet, that's a completely arbitrary number."" 4. When will international investigators get access to the crash site? No one knows. A U.N. Security Council meeting ended early Monday, with Australia introducing a resolution that called for a swift international investigation. ""There's no doubt that at the moment, the site is under the control of the Russian-backed rebels. And given the almost certain culpability of the Russian-backed rebels in the downing of the aircraft, having those people in control of the site is a little like leaving criminals in control of a crime scene,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Monday. But Russia, which has veto power as a permanent member of the council, wants a modified resolution -- one that leaves out Ukraine from any investigation. 5. How will Russia respond? If an investigation concludes the plane was shot down by rebels using a Russian-supplied missile -- or, worse still, by Russians themselves -- President Vladimir Putin will have two choices. And neither, says professor Daniel Treisman, works to his advantage. Putin could reject the conclusions and stand by the rebels. If he does so, he risks becoming an international pariah. The West might also hit Russia with even tougher economic sanctions, enough to cripple its economy and send it into a recession. Or, Putin could sever ties with the rebels. But that could present problems, too. ""A relentless barrage of propaganda has convinced many Russians that their co-ethnics in Donetsk and Luhansk are being massacred by troops commanded by a fascist regime in Kiev,""  said Treisman, who teaches political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, and who authored the book The Return: Russia's Journey from Gorbachev to Medvedev."" ""For Putin to bow to international pressure and abandon his former charges would look like cowardice.""","The U.N. Security Council is calling for a swift international investigation .

But that needn't apply to those in Melbourne, which for the fourth year running has been declared the best city in the world to live. The Australian culture hub was buoyed by superlative healthcare, infrastructure and education as well as a murder rate of 3.1 per 100,000 people, half the global average of 6.2. Melbourne's total score of 97.5, assessed on various factors such as ""stability"" and ""culture and environment,"" as well as those mentioned above, was just 0.1 points above Vienna, which scored identically across all categories to Melbourne except culture and environment. The top 10 list hasn't changed since 2011 and of the 140 cities surveyed, only 20 changed score in the last year. ""Over half of the changes taking place over the past 12 months have been driven by deteriorating scores,"" said the report, ""with instability re-emerging as a key factor in influencing global scores.

"Jada, a Houston-area 16-year-old, was getting ready for finals week and looking forward to a summer hanging out with friends and finding a job. On June 1, she went to a friend of a friend's house party.  She recalls little of what went on that evening, she told CNN, but does remember passing out and waking up the next morning at another friend's house with her clothing askew. Weeks later, she received text messages showing photos of her unconscious and undressed that appeared to have been taken at the party. Soon, those photos spread on social media, with Twitter users mimicking her passed-out pose and adding the hashtag #jadapose. Jada and her mother  filed a police report about the incident June 22. ""It is an active investigation,"" said Jodi Silva, a spokeswoman for the Houston Police Department. ""We're following up on leads that have been given to us. We don't want to rush the investigation, because there are many facets to it."" In light of the photos and humiliating #jadapose meme, Jada might have chosen to hide in shame. But in a time when all aspects of teen life have moved from private to public forums, something unique happened: She took hold of the story. Jada chose to show her face with the support of her mother, Sukiedia. (The family has not used their last name in interviews.) The teen began speaking to local and national media about the incident and took a photo with the hashtag #iamjada to reveal the real person behind the viral photos. ""There's no point in hiding,"" she told a Houston television station. ""Everybody has already seen my face and my body, but that's not what I am and who I am."" From beauty queen to rape activist . CNN does not normally identify victims of sexual assault but is doing so in this case because the alleged victim is speaking out. Jada isn't the only alleged assault victim moving to reclaim her name and image. In 2013, Missouri teen Daisy Coleman spoke publicly with the support of her mother after claiming that she was raped by a popular member of her school's football team. Last spring, a young woman took to Twitter to ask rape victims to share what they were wearing when they were assaulted, to knock down the assumption that their attire ""asked for it."" It led to a discussion on Twitter with the hashtag #RapeHasNoUniform. ""With the case of Jada, the very technology that was used to make matters worse was used to improve matters,"" said Stephen Balkam, who has a teenage daughter and is CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute. In the past week, as word spread about the #jadapose meme, messages of support have poured in. ""Rape isn't funny,"" one post says. Social media users are adopting the #IamJada hashtag and posting photos of themselves with a fist raised in solidarity. ""This could be you, me, or any woman or girl that we know. What do we plan to do about this ugly epidemic? #justiceforjada,"" actress Jada Pinkett Smith wrote on her Facebook page. Even as public support for Jada is swelling, it's clear that online abuse isn't going away anytime soon. ""Teens need to understand that their online behavior has lasting and permanent impacts,"" Jim Steyer, a father of four and CEO of Common Sense Media, wrote in an e-mail. A 2011 Pew study found that 88% of social media-using teens reported that they have seen someone being mean to another person on a social network, and 15% of teens using social media reported being harassed. More teens are pushing back at this meme-ification of violence by speaking up and creating communities of kindness.  But it can sometimes be a trickier path for parents to navigate, experts say. ""Being proactive in our kids' online lives is key,"" Steyer wrote. ""It's not just about turning off devices or encouraging responsible use. It's about creating a culture of empathy. It's about knowing what to say and do when your kid is at risk, monitoring (without spying), and knowing the difference between bullying and behavior that is 'kids being kids.' "" When online abuse goes viral, it doesn't mean the pain is virtual -- and the solution isn't one size fits all. Scholar Danah Boyd writes about the importance of nuance in addressing online bullying in her book ""It's Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens."" ""Blaming technology or assuming that conflict will disappear if technology usage is minimized is naive,"" she writes (PDF). ""Recognizing where teens are at and why they engage in particular acts of meanness and cruelty is important to creating interventions that work."" But parents don't have to do it alone. Resources on A Platform for Good can help guide conversations with teens about their digital reputation. Common Sense Media works with schools across America teaching the K-12 Digital Literacy and Citizenship curriculum.  MTV's A Thin Line campaign aims to stop the spread of digital abuse.  And author MacKenzie Bezos started the Bystander Revolution, which offers simple ideas to encourage kindness and defuse bullying. Having a dialogue with kids around acceptable online behavior can begin by talking about events in the news, such as #iamJada, or at school. That starts with teaching kids empathy and accountability. How to talk to your son about rape . Parents ""should encourage their kids to be up-standers and not bystanders when they see something as negative as what was happening to Jada,"" Balkam said. Speaking up may not be easy, he adds, but it's worthwhile, whether you're a bystander or a victim of abuse. As for Jada, supporters are calling her ""brave"" and a ""hero."" And she is beginning to feel like one. ""Yes, I feel like a heroine, because it takes courage to speak out and show your face, "" she said.","A Houston teen told her story on television after photos of her passed out became a meme .
Hers is example of images depicting alleged abuse making the rounds among teens .

"Voters in 11 rural counties in northern Colorado will go the polls Tuesday to decide whether they want to continue living in the 137-year-old state or break off and form their own. Even if a majority of voters in the referendum approve secession, breaking away would be a daunting, perhaps nigh-on-impossible path. A new state would require approval first in the Colorado legislature and then from the U.S. Congress, as laid out by Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution. But then, that's not the point. The point, says Sean Conway, is to send a message ""to the governor. Send a message to our legislators,"" said the commissioner of Weld County, the most populous of the 11 counties seeking to secede. ""We're tired of being ignored, we're tired of being politically disenfranchised, and if you don't wake up and you don't start to change things, you're going to see more movements like this begin to take a more serious face and move towards creating our own political entity that we believe will protect our very way of life and our economy."" Few in Colorado expect the secession movement to succeed. But for many in the 11 counties -- 10 in the northeast and one in the northwest that would join Wyoming -- it seems the only viable option for having their voices heard in a Democratic-controlled state legislature that they feel puts the concerns of urban residents ahead of the concerns of those in rural areas. In part, rural Coloradans feel they weren't heard when the state passed a stringent gun control measure, a law that lead to the successful recall of two of the state's most powerful Democratic legislators. But the straw that really broke the camel's back, according to Conway, was an energy bill that raised the amount of electricity that must come from renewable sources. Conway argues the law unfairly favored urban communities while putting a much harsher, more expensive burden on those in rural areas. ""We're not renewable-energy unfriendly out here in rural Colorado,"" Conway said. ""But when you start imposing mandates different on other folks than yourself, that's the definition of tyranny, and I think it's kind of where this whole issue started to manifest itself."" No governor wants to preside over a breakup of his or her state, and Gov. John Hickenlooper is no exception. ""Rural communities are hurting, but it's not because of background checks on guns sales, civil unions for gay people or expanded renewable energy. In fact, these are popular proposals across communities large and small. The same is true of our efforts to protect water for agricultural uses, expand broadband into rural areas, and promote tourism and economic diversity across the state,"" the Democratic governor said in a statement. ""There may be a political agenda behind secession I don't get, because when I think of Colorado, it means all of our diverse communities and people. I can't imagine Colorado being Colorado without the Eastern Plains. If this talk of a 51st state is about politics designed to divide us, it is destructive. But if it is about sending a message, then I see our responsibility to lean in and do a better job of listening."" When it comes to the counties considering secession, politics run hand in hand with geography. When Seth Masket, a political science professor at the University of Denver did the math, he realized that had the 11 counties been a state of their own in the 2012 elections, that state would have been the second most Republican of all, behind only Utah. Yet Colorado overall went to President Barack Obama, earning 51% of the vote compared to Mitt Romney's 46%. ""You see this going on in a lot of states, that increasingly you have one-party control in a lot of state governments. Right now there are 43 states where one party is in control of both chambers of the state legislature,"" Masket said. ""That's actually the highest number since the 1950s, and the minority party is looking for ways to stop that in different places."" But Jeffrey Hare says secession isn't about politics. ""It's about having a government that is responsive to the needs of its communities, and what we've seen at the state level is an urban-based legislature forced their will against rural Colorado time and time again,"" said the organizer of The 51st State Initiative. ""We think this is a healthy response to this urban-versus-rural divide that's not just the case in Colorado. It's really throughout the country."" Secession is not the only item on Colorado's referendum ballot Tuesday. While only the 11 northern counties will be voting on breaking away from the state, all the Centennial State will be voting on a school-funding bill and on raising new taxes for marijuana, which was recently legalized. A new state from a portion of the old is not unprecedented, Conway said. Of the 50 states, five were once part of another: Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky, Maine and Vermont. Also worth noting: No state has broken away since West Virginia in 1863 and no state has technically seceded since North Carolina in 1861. Not everyone in Weld County agrees with Conway and Hare. District Attorney Ken Buck says he won't be voting for the non-binding measure, even if he understands it. ""It's not the best strategy. The best strategy for dealing with the political issues is through the political system,"" said the U.S. Senate candidate. Working through the system hasn't worked out for a lot of conservative causes lately. ""I think what's happening is that things are moving so fast the people don't feel included in the process. We've legalized marijuana. We've legalized civil unions. We've legalized a lot of things very quickly,"" Buck said. ""That's a lot of change for people to accept.""","Colorado's secession referendum highlights state's urban-rural divide .

"On Friday the U.S. State Department issued a worldwide travel alert because of an unspecified al Qaeda threat.  The location of that threat, the department said in a bulletin, is ""particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, and possibly occurring in or emanating from the Arabian Peninsula."" As a result, an unprecedented 22 embassies and consulates in 17 countries in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia closed for a day on Sunday. Sunday is also the 27th day of Ramadan and a particularly holy day for the world's Muslims as it is the ""Night of Power,"" when the first verses of the Koran were revealed to the Prophet Mohammed. It is also seen by al Qaeda's would-be martyrs as a particularly auspicious day to die. On the Night of Power in 2000, which that year fell on January 3, al Qaeda militants attempted to launch a suicide attack against the American warship USS The Sullivans off the coast of Yemen with a bomb-filled boat. That attack failed, but the same group of militants then attacked the USS Cole 10 months later, again using the tactic of a bomb-laden boat, which exploded, killing 17 American sailors. Is rash of brazen prison breaks related? It was the day after the Night of Power in December 2001 that Osama bin Laden signed his will as he feared death from American bombs falling during the battle of Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan. Al Qaeda and aligned organizations have a long history of attacking U.S. embassies and consulates, beginning in 1998 with the bombings of the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, which killed more than 200, and including, most recently, the storming of the U.S. government facility in Benghazi, Libya, on the 11th anniversary of 9/11 last year. For al Qaeda, these diplomatic compounds are attractive targets because they symbolize American power and because their locations are widely known. Indeed, several of the embassies and consulates closed on Sunday have been attacked by al Qaeda and affiliated groups before. In Saudi Arabia, militants breached the outer wall of the U.S. consulate in Jeddah on December 7, 2004, killing five. The U.S. embassy in Sana'a, Yemen, was targeted by an al Qaeda affiliate two times in 2008, attacks that killed 21. On September 13, 2011, the Haqqani network, a Taliban group closely associated with al Qaeda, attacked the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, killing five Afghan police officers and 11 civilians. Though U.S. officials have not confirmed the targeting of a specific embassy, it is likely that the American compound in Cairo is a particular point of concern.  In May, three men were arrested by Egyptian officials, who said the men were planning to attack the embassy. Officials said they discovered 22 pounds of aluminum nitrate, instructions on how to make bombs, and materials published by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the network's North African affiliate. Another possible factor in the timing of the al Qaeda alert is that in the past two weeks, massive jailbreaks in Iraq and Libya have released more than a thousand prisoners, some with significant ties to al Qaeda.  Very few of those inmates have been recaptured. The U.S. embassies in Baghdad, Iraq, and Tripoli, Libya, are among the facilities that will be closed on Sunday. (Note: An earlier version of this story misstated the timing of Osama bin Laden's will signing.)","Bergen, Cahall: U.S. issued global travel alert, 21 embassies, consulates close Aug. 4 .

"Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford apologized for ""a lot of stupid things"" Sunday but said he won't resign despite reports that police have video that purportedly shows him smoking a crack pipe. ""Friends, I'm the first one to admit I am not perfect. I have made mistakes. I have made mistakes, and all I can do right now is apologize for the mistakes,"" Ford said during an appearance on Toronto radio station CFRB. ""I want to move forward, but I also know to move forward I have to make changes in my life, which I can assure you that I will do,"" he added. ""I love the work I do, and I'm going to keep doing it."" Ford co-hosted CFRB's ""The City"" with his brother Doug, a member of Toronto's city council. In response to callers, he said his apology referred to two previously reported incidents where he appeared to have been drunk in public and ""a lot of stupid things, all self-inflicted"" that he didn't detail. He has repeatedly denied using crack and has not been charged with any crime. In May, two media outlets began to report that Ford was recorded on video last winter using crack cocaine. Thursday, Toronto Police Chief William Blair told reporters that investigators had recovered a video from a computer seized during a drug investigation that featured images ""consistent with those that have previously been reported in the press."" Blair said Ford appears in the video but would not detail what he's doing. Ford said Sunday that he hasn't seen the video, and he called on Blair ""to release this video for every single person in the city to see."" Toronto mayor says he won't resign despite possibly damning video . ""That is the right thing to do, and Chief, I'm asking you to release this video now,"" Ford said. ""Whatever this video shows, folks, Toronto residents deserve to see it, and people need to judge for themselves what they see on this video."" Ford was elected to a four-year term in 2010 and has touted tax cuts and streamlined government under his administration. He told listeners that he wanted to finish his term and let voters decide whether they want to keep him in 2014. ""Unfortunately, I cannot change the past. I can just move forward and learn from the past, which I assure you I am doing,"" he said. Most of the calls taken on the show were from self-described supporters, some of whom urged Ford to step down. ""I am not a hater, and we all make mistakes, and none of us are perfect,"" one woman said. ""I just personally believe that maybe you need some time away and come back fresh."" Another told Ford, ""I want you to take a medical leave. Just a medical leave .The city will survive. You need it ... Please listen to me. Your family deserves better."" But others urged him to hang tough: ""I think you're just getting railroaded by the corrupt media,"" another caller said. In May, the website Gawker and the Toronto Star newspaper published stories saying their reporters had seen 90 seconds of a cell phone video showing the 44-year-old Ford, as the Star described it, ""inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe."" Later in the video -- as described by the Star -- an ""incoherent"" man both the Star and Gawker claimed to be Ford ranted about a number of subjects. The video, which has never been released publicly, shows a ""clearly impaired mayor,"" two reporters who say they saw the video wrote in the Star. Then, police recovered video from deleted files on a computer hard drive that was seized during a drug and gang investigation, according to a 465-page report by Toronto police disclosed last week. The report includes hundreds of redacted pages and states that police sources believe the photo of Ford that first surfaced in May is taken in front of a ""trap"" house used to ""chop"" crack. Police documents also detail evidence used to obtain a search warrant for a man suspected of drug trafficking, Alexander (Sandro) Lisi, who police say is the mayor's friend as well as his driver. Photos collected by police show Ford and Lisi together on a number of occasions, including attending a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game, according to the documents. Lisi was arrested Thursday and charged with extortion, according to a police statement. He is accused of using extortion to retrieve a recording, it said. Blair said a digital video in police custody will be shown in court in an effort to support the charge against Lisi, who was released after a bail hearing Friday, his lawyer, Seth Weinstein, said.

"Taking the stand on Wednesday, the third day of the George Zimmerman trial, a friend of Trayvon Martin testified Wednesday about the final moments of the teenager's life, saying that Martin told her someone was following him. ""A man was watching him,"" said Rachel Jeantel, 19, who was on the phone with Martin just before he was fatally shot. ""He said the man kept watching him. He kept complaining that a man was just watching him."" That man was Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch captain charged with second-degree murder for killing 17-year-old Martin in Sanford, Florida, on February 26, 2012. He told police he was pursuing the teenager because there had been a rash of crime in the area. A confrontation ensued, and Zimmerman said he was forced to kill Martin in self-defense. Jeantel testified that as he neared the home of his father's girlfriend, Martin tried to lose Zimmerman. ""And then he said, 'That N-word is still following me now,'"" said Jeantel. ""I asked him how the man looked like. He just told me the man looked 'creepy.' 'Creepy, white' -- excuse my language -- 'cracker. Creepy [expletive] cracker."" Jeantel says she heard Martin talking to Zimmerman in the background of the call. ""He said, 'Why are you following me for?' And I heard a hard-breathing man say, 'What you doing around here?'"" said Jeantel. Jeantel also said she heard a bump from Martin's headset hitting something and ""wet grass sounds."" ""I start hearing a little bit of Trayvon saying, 'Get off, get off!'"" said Jeantel. Fast facts: Trayvon Martin shooting . She told the prosecutor that the screams for help heard on the 911 call made by a neighbor belong to Martin. But on cross-examination, defense attorney Don West read part of a transcript from Jeantel's deposition, in which she said she wasn't sure if it was Martin's voice or not. ""It could be. Like I said, I don't know but it could be,"" said Jeantel, according to the transcript. ""The dude sound kind of like Trayvon. Trayvon do got that soft voice and that baby voice sometimes, so it could be, I don't know."" Jeantel admitted to West that she lied several times to Martin's family. She said she told them she was 16, not 18, because she wanted to be treated like a minor and have privacy. She also said she lied about not attending Martin's memorial service because she was in the hospital. The truth, she said, was that she was afraid to see the body. ""You got to understand, you the last person to talk to the person and he died on the phone after you talked to him -- you got to understand what I'm trying to tell you,"" said Jeantel. ""I'm the last person, you don't know how it felt. You think I really want to go see the body after I just talked to him?"" Jeantel said. Jeantel appeared to get frustrated several times during the cross-examination, including one time when West suggested they could break until the morning so she'd have more time to review the deposition transcript. ""No, I'm leaving today,"" Jeantel told the defense attorney as she looked over the papers. ""Are you refusing to come back tomorrow?"" asked West. The judge stepped in and asked West to keep the questions and answers to Jeantel's testimony. Earlier in the afternoon, jurors heard five other non-emergency calls Zimmerman made reporting suspicious people in his neighborhood. The defense wanted the calls to be thrown out, questioning their relevance, but the judge ruled they would be allowed in. Prosecutors had argued that the calls show Zimmerman's state of mind the night he shot Martin. In one of the calls, made on February 2, 2012, about three weeks before Martin's death, Zimmerman told the dispatcher he saw a black man walking around a neighbor's home. He said he also had seen this man walking around the neighborhood on trash days. ""I don't know what he's doing, I don't want to approach him, personally,"" said Zimmerman on the recording. Opening statements: Expletives and a knock-knock joke . In another call made in October 2011, Zimmerman reported two ""suspicious characters"" who were ""just hanging out, loitering"" in his neighborhood. When the dispatcher asked if he can still see the suspects, Zimmerman said no because he ""didn't want to attract attention"" to himself. An eyewitness who also testified on Wednesday said she heard what sounded ""like a boy"" cry for help during the altercation that ended in Martin's death. Jayne Surdyka, Zimmerman's former neighbor, said she heard screams and opened her window to look out into the courtyard on the night of the shooting. Defense attorney West challenged Surdyka about what she heard that night, saying it is possible for a teenager to have a deeper voice and for a man to have a higher-pitched voice. ""It sounded more like a boy to me,"" said Surdyka. Multiple times, Surdyka said she saw two men struggling on the ground, one on top of the other, but she couldn't discern who was on top because it was dark and rainy that night. Prosecutor Bernie De La Rionda played for the jury the 911 call Surdyka made the night of shooting. On the recording, Surdyka is heard crying and becoming hysterical. The 911 operator stayed on the phone with her to calm her down. Prosecutors also called Jeannee Manalo, another witness, to the stand Wednesday. Manalo testified that from her point of view inside her townhome, she could see two men struggling on the ground. She also said she believes Zimmerman was on top of Martin during the altercation and that she could see his hands moving. During cross-examination, Manalo said photographs she saw on the news of a younger Martin support her view that Zimmerman was on top during the altercation. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara asked her if she had ever seen recent photos of Martin. She said no but maintained that based on the photographs, the bigger person was on top, and Zimmerman seemed to be the bigger person. Before court recessed for the day, the defense told the judge it expects to need a couple more hours to question Martin's friend, Jeantel. Testimony is scheduled to resume Thursday at 9 a.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- The world is facing an increasing risk of ""irreversible"" climate shifts because worst-case scenarios warned of two years ago are being realized, an international panel of scientists has warned. Drought, flooding, storms and mass extinction in the future will have a heavy social cost as well. Temperatures, sea levels, acid levels in oceans and ice sheets were already moving ""beyond the patterns of natural variability within which our society and economy have developed and thrived,"" scientists said in a report released Thursday. The findings came at the end of a three-day conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, where nearly 2,000 researchers gathered to discuss climate change. The group called on policy-makers to use all tools available to reduce dangerous emissions of greenhouse gases. The current climate situation on the planet may be as severe as the worst-case scenarios predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which issued warnings in 2007 of a future beset by flooding, drought, storms and mass extinction of species. In its report, the researchers also warned of potential social costs across the planet because of climate change. Temperature rises above 2 degrees Celsius would lead to climate disruption for the rest of the century and disproportionately affect poor nations, the researchers warned. ""Recent observations show that societies are highly vulnerable to even modest levels of climate change, with poor nations and communities particularly at risk,"" the report said. The conclusions of the conference will be presented to politicians when they meet in Copenhagen in December. It is then that leaders will discuss a new global agreement on greenhouse gas emission levels to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.","Worst-case scenarios warned of two years ago are being realized, says scientists .

"The family of a Texas convict executed for the deaths of his three daughters in a 1991 fire launched a new effort to clear his name Wednesday by asking the state parole board for a posthumous pardon. Cameron Todd Willingham was put to death in 2004 for setting the fire that killed the girls: Amber, Karmon and Kameron. But three expert reviews have concluded Willingham's conviction was based on evidence of arson that was outdated, and his family has insisted on his innocence. ""An error was made, and it is not too late to clear it up,"" the family's lawyers wrote in a petition filed with the state Board of Pardons and Paroles in Austin. Willingham and his family ""deserve more,"" and ""perhaps more importantly, the State of Texas deserves more."" Junk science? Inmates fight to disprove arson . The board denied clemency for Willingham before his execution, dismissing the first of three reviews that questioned the arson finding at the heart of Willingham's prosecution. Two subsequent studies have reached the same conclusion, finding that most of the signs investigators looked for as proof the fire was deliberately set had been rendered obsolete by a series of studies in the 1990s. The last study was produced for the Texas Forensic Science Commission, which began looking into the Willingham case in 2008. A subsequent shakeup of the commission by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who allowed Willingham's execution to go forward, led to accusations that the governor was trying to derail the investigation. Perry has called Willingham a ""monster"" whose conviction withstood every appeal. Police and prosecutors in Corsicana, where the fire occurred, also stand by their case. Willingham professed his innocence in his final statement, but his ex-wife has said he confessed to killing the girls before the execution. A jailhouse informant who testified in his trial has recanted his statement that Willingham admitted to setting the fire, and a now-retired judge who sat on the state court that rejected Willingham's appeal has written that the execution was ""a miscarriage of justice"" for which he was partly responsible, the family noted in its petition. The Forensic Science Commission's investigation effectively ended in 2011, when a state attorney general's opinion sharply restricted the panel's jurisdiction. Goldstein said going to the pardons board -- whose members are Perry appointees -- was ""one of the last resorts"" the family has, but added, ""This is about righting a wrong."" ""This isn't about finger-pointing. It's not about blaming anyone. It's about giving a man his good name back,"" he said. ""He died with little else but his name, and we took that from him."" Harry Battson, a spokesman for the pardons board, said the agency's staff will review the petition, notifying trial officials and surviving victims and preparing a file for board members. Applications typically take three to four months to process, he said. Film questions Texas death penalty arson case .","Cameron Todd Willingham was executed in Texas in 2004 .

"(CNN) -- A Delta Air Lines flight reporting an engine problem made an emergency landing Thursday at the Colorado Springs, Colorado, airport, officials said. Two passengers suffered minor injuries during the evacuation, said John McGinley, assistant director of operations and maintenance at the airport. Flight 1921, a Boeing 757, was flying from Detroit to Phoenix when the captain saw a light indicating possible problems with one of the engines, Delta spokesman Anthony Black said. The pilot diverted the flight, and during the landing, the captain received another indicator light showing overheating to the rear wheel, Black said. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said there was a fire in the main landing gear when the plane landed. Passengers were evacuated on slides from the side of the aircraft. CNN affiliate KRDO said the injuries occurred during the evacuation. CNN's Sally Holland contributed to this report.","Delta flight makes emergency landing in Colorado .

"More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's today, with another person developing the disease every 68 seconds. By 2050, the number of people living with Alzheimer's disease is expected to triple. As if those numbers weren't staggering enough, consider this: Alzheimer's disease is the only cause of death among the top 10 (it's currently ranked No. 6) in the United States that can't be prevented, cured or slowed down. Ask any expert, and he or she will tell you that early diagnosis is key to helping patients live better day to day, so even though the disease is still progressing, the symptoms are less harsh. ""Our hope is that if we could identify patients who are developing the disease early, it would give us a much better opportunity to intervene with treatments, and it's much more likely for those treatments to be effective,"" says Dr. Keith Black, chairman of neurosurgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. But while early diagnosis leads to early intervention, some news out of the 2013 Alzheimer's Association International Conference is troubling: An expert panel found 16 online tests for Alzheimer's disease scored poorly on scales of overall scientific validity, reliability and ethical factors. ""Self-diagnosis behavior ... is increasingly popular online, and freely accessible quizzes that call themselves 'tests' for Alzheimer's are available on the Internet,"" says Julie Robillard, who presented the data this week in Boston. ""However, little is known about the scientific validity and reliability of these offerings and ethics-related factors, including research and commercial conflict of interest, confidentiality and consent."" ""Frankly,"" Robillard adds, ""what we found online was distressing and potentially harmful."" Robillard and her colleagues at the University of British Columbia found that unique monthly visitors for the parent sites hosting the online tests reached as high as 8.8 million. At the same conference, another study concluded that the misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in Medicare patients who actually have vascular dementia or Parkinson's disease leads to substantial excess costs of care. The study, conducted by Analysis Group, Inc. and Eli Lilly and Co., found the costs of erroneous care to be in excess of $14,000 a year per patient . The silver lining: Those excess costs decline and eventually dissipate following a correct diagnosis. ""Recent developments in technology have greatly improved our ability to properly diagnose patients with cognitive impairment,"" said Analysis Group's Noam Kirson. ""Our results suggest that there are economic benefits to properly diagnosing -- as early as possible -- the cause of the cognitive impairment."" If you suspect a family member or friend is developing Alzheimer's, take a look at these 10 warning signs of Alzheimer's Disease, put together by the Alzheimer's Association: . 1.Memory changes that disrupt daily life . 2.Challenges in planning or solving problems . 3.Difficulty completing familiar tasks at home, at work, or at leisure . 4.Confusion with time or place . 5.Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships . 6.New problems with words in speaking or writing . 7.Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps . 8.Decreased or poor judgment . 9.Withdrawal from work or social activities . 10.Changes in mood and personality .

You can also find more information at www.alz.org, or by calling the Alzheimer's Association's 24-hour hotline at (800) 272-3900. The importance of early detection and early intervention can't be stressed strongly enough. It could mean added years of lucidity and life for you or someone you love.

"(CNN) -- Canada's House of Commons voted 156-145 on Friday on a no-confidence resolution aimed at the Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, triggering the dissolution of Parliament and elections in the next few weeks. Liberal party leader Michael Ignatieff sponsored the resolution, citing a recent House committee report that found the government in contempt for failing to provide lawmakers with requested information on its spending plans. ""The principle at stake in this debate goes to the heart of parliamentary democracy: the obligation of a government to provide members of this House with the information they need in order to hold the government accountable to the people of Canada,"" Ignatieff said in prepared remarks introducing the no-confidence resolution. ""We are the people's representatives. When the government spends money, the people have a right to know what it is to be spent on. This Parliament does not write blank cheques."" The resolution automatically triggers elections to replace the Conservative-led minority government, which has ruled Canada since 2006. The motion was ill-conceived, said Government House Leader John Baird, a Tory. ""The Liberal members over there claimed to have found that the government has done something wrong,"" Baird said. ""What they aren't telling Canadians is that this was an opposition-stacked committee who used the tyranny of the majority to get the predetermined outcome they wanted."" The no-confidence vote was the fifth in Canadian history, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.","The House of Commons votes 156-145 in favor of a no-confidence motion .

"The future of NASA's planet-hunting Kepler space observatory was in question Wednesday after a part that helps aim the spacecraft stopped working, the U.S. space agency said. Controllers found Tuesday that Kepler had gone into a ""safe mode"" and one of the reaction wheels needed to orient the spacecraft would not spin, Associate NASA Administrator John Grunsfeld told reporters. NASA engineers are trying to figure out whether they can get the balky part back into service or whether they can resume control by another method, Grunsfeld said. ""We're not ready to call the mission over,"" he said. But at roughly 40 million miles from Earth, ""Kepler is not in a place where I can go up and rescue it."" Another Earth called a certainty . The Kepler mission has identified 132 planets beyond our solar system since its launch in 2009, leading scientists to believe that most stars in our galaxy have planets circling them. It has gone into a ""safe mode"" with its solar panels facing back at the sun, giving controllers intermittent communication with the craft as it spins. Three new planets could host life . The probe was built with four reaction wheels and needs three of them -- one for each axis -- to aim its telescope precisely at a distant star, deputy project manager Charlie Sobeck said. One failed in July 2012, leaving it with only two functioning wheels at this time, Sobeck said. Kepler shut itself down after it was pointing in the wrong direction, Sobeck said. He said it was ""reasonable to suspect"" the failure of the reaction wheel was the cause, but scientists hadn't confirmed that. More news about Kepler . The $600 million mission was designed to operate for three and a half to six years. Even if controllers are unable to return it to service, NASA said the mission has produced enough data to keep scientists busy for up to two years.

"Iraqi lawmakers elected a Sunni politician as Parliament speaker Tuesday, finally taking a step to form a new government after two weeks of deadlock while the country faces a powerful Islamist militant insurgency. Lawmakers elected Salim al-Jabouri, the head of a Sunni coalition, as speaker of Iraq's Council of Representatives. The Iraqi Constitution mandates that the job go to a Sunni Muslim. The body also elected two deputy speakers. MAPS: Understanding the Iraq crisis . Al-Jabouri announced that lawmakers are accepting nominations for president, saying that there are three days to nominate and then the body will reconvene. The president must be Kurdish and the prime minister a Shiite. The body had convened July 1 to elect a new speaker, but the session quickly descended into bickering between members of different parties and had to be rescheduled for July 8. That session was delayed, and more arguing erupted. Under the constitution, the Parliament has 75 days from when it convenes to pick a prime minister. While lawmakers are under pressure to act quickly, the political body has had trouble moving swiftly in the past. The last time Parliament met to pick a prime minister, it took nearly 10 months. The quagmire persists even as fighters with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS -- a Sunni-dominated al Qaeda splinter group -- have overtaken large swaths of Iraq and Syria. The militants want to establish an Islamic state spanning both countries. President Barack Obama has authorized 300 military advisers in Iraq, 210 of which are there now. Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement of congratulation to Iraq for electing a speaker and deputy speakers. ""The election of a speaker is the first step in the critical process of forming a new government that can take into account the rights, aspirations, and legitimate concerns of all Iraq's communities,"" the statement read. ""We urge Iraq's leaders to follow this achievement with rapid formation of a new government pursuant to Iraq's constitutional timelines."" The statement urged the international community to support Iraq's ""democrative political process,"" adding that the ""stakes of Ira's future"" depend on its leaders to work together and stand against ISIS. Obama has ordered an assessment of Iraqi security forces, which was given Monday to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a Pentagon spokesman said. Pentagon officials will review the report that evaluates the capabilities, training, morale, leadership and command and control of Iraqi forces and then hand it to the President and give Obama their recommendations for the best next steps in supporting Iraq. Many Iraqi troops abandoned their posts and fled when faced with attacks from ISIS. Two U.S. officials told CNN this week that the administration is concerned about the overwhelming sectarianism among members of Iraq's security forces. American commanders are concerned if the United States moves into a direct advisory role of Iraqi government forces, it will be perceived as taking sides with the Iranian-backed Shiite elements inside Iraqi units. In Syria, ISIS continues to gain ground. As of Monday, the group controlled about 95% of the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq, according to the UK-based opposition group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

"Henrique Capriles Radonski is the fast-rising conservative challenging President Hugo Chavez in Sunday's elections. At age 40, he has been a mayor, a parliament leader, a governor of a major state and he's now the candidate of an opposition coalition seeking to knock Chavez out of power after 13 years. Capriles enjoys the backing of a coalition of opposition parties. An attorney, he was elected to parliament in 1998, when Venezuela had a bicameral legislature. He was just 25 years old at the time, but he quickly advanced to become the president of the Chamber of Deputies and then president of the entire Parliament. But the bicameral legislature was dissolved in 1999. The following year, Capriles was elected mayor of Baruta, which is located in the state of Miranda and is a suburb in the Caracas metropolitan area. He became mayor with more than 60% of the vote in 2000. In 2002, he become involved in violent anti-government demonstrations outside the Cuban Embassy and spent four months in jail. The tumult was so powerful that Chavez was briefly ousted from office. Capriles was eventually released from jail and cleared of any wrongdoing. He then was reelected mayor with almost 80% approval in 2004. In 2008, he ran for governor of Miranda and won. He kept pursuing higher office, and this February he won an opposition primary and became the candidate to run against Chavez. He has since stepped down from the governorship to campaign full time. Capriles' grandparents were Polish Holocaust survivors, but he is a practicing Catholic, according to the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center.","Henrique Capriles Radonski has been a parliament leader, mayor and governor .

"June 21 is the longest day of the year. Yes, from now on, we'll lose a few minutes of daylight each day. Before that panicked feeling of time slipping away kicks in (I already have too much to do and now my days will be even shorter?), take a deep breath. There's hope. First off, it turns out our time isn't as scarce as we have convinced ourselves it is. And second, new research has demonstrated effective strategies to help mitigate the pangs of our time famine. No one can truly give you more time -- after all, there are only 24 hours in a day regardless of how long or short those hours feel -- but a few simple changes in how you spend your time, and your money, can turn feelings of famine into feelings of plenty. Our general feeling of time scarcity isn't just caused by shortening days. On a larger scale, people seem to have the sense that their time has become more limited -- that compared to earlier generations, we spend more and more time working and have less and less free time to engage in leisure pursuits. Indeed, this general feeling of an impending time famine has helped give rise to the Slow Movement, with pursuits ranging from Slow Food to Slow Parenting and Slow Gardening (which we thought was kind of slow to begin with) promising to help the time-poor get off the high-speed treadmill of modern life. But this basic premise turns out to be an illusion. The most comprehensive data from major time-use surveys suggest that, if anything, Americans today have more free time than earlier generations. That's right: The number of hours we work has not changed much, but we spend less time now on home tasks, so we have a greater amount of time for leisure than in decades past. So, why do we feel like time is so scarce? One problem is that our time has become more valuable. And as time becomes worth more money, we feel like we have less of it. Workers who bill or get paid by the hour -- think lawyers and fast-food workers -- report focusing more on pursuing more money than those who get paid a salary. And the effect happens fast. In one experiment, people were told to play the role of consultants and bill their time at either $9 an hour or $90 an hour. When people billed their time for $90 an hour, they reported feeling far more pressed for time. Thinking about our time as money changes our behavior as well. In another study, people who billed their time were less likely to volunteer their time for good causes. Once we start to think about how much money we are giving up (I could make $90 instead of helping out in that soup kitchen), it suddenly seems foolish to sacrifice the cash just to ladle some soup to strangers. And the effects are evident in more everyday interactions, too. In one study, people who were instructed to think about money before entering a cafe spent less time chatting with the other patrons and more time working. Those who were thinking about their time did the reverse, spending time socializing instead of working. So what's the problem with a little less socializing and a little less volunteering? Both of these activities are strongly associated with happiness. Volunteers are happier people, and social interaction is a key element of human well-being. Indeed, one recent study  showed that just taking the time to chat with the cashier at Starbucks left people feeling happier than simply making the same exchange as efficient as possible. Chatting, it seems, is good for our happiness. Being happier would be nice, we can all agree, but do volunteering and socializing have any impact on solving our feelings of time famine? Luckily, the benefits of these activities extend beyond happiness. When people feel their time is scarce, they often attempt to carve out some ""me"" time -- going for a massage or taking a nap. Sure, massages and snoozes are great, and undeniably nice while in progress. But research shows that once they are over, we feel just as stressed about our time as we did before. Instead, our research shows that encouraging people to spend time on and with others -- for example, shoveling someone's driveway in the winter or helping a student with her homework -- actually makes people feel less stressed about their own time. In fact, helping others makes us feel more effective in our ability to get our daily tasks done. Helping others makes us feel as though we accomplished a goal, and that feeling of accomplishment appears to carry over to when we turn from helping others back to checking off tasks on our own to-do lists. The modern time famine appears to be primarily in our heads; we don't really have more to do than we did in the good old days. As a result, fixing the time famine requires intervention in the mind, via strategies that alleviate the stress of perceived time scarcity. And lest you think that decreasing your time stress is a waste of, well, time, research shows that feelings of time affluence are a crucial contributor to our happiness. And that holds true even for people who say they like being busy. When time feels short -- whether due to the change of seasons or the sheer number of things we must get done -- our inclination is to hunker down and focus on making more money and treating ourselves. It may be wiser when strapped for time to use the time you have to reach out and help someone else.","Authors: Americans perceive they have less time and more to do .
They say best data show Americans aren't working more, only feeling more rushed .

"The opposition Free Syrian Army is turning against foreign fighters in Syria's civil war, arresting some 200 outsiders with ties to al-Qaeda groups. The FSA had given members of the al-Qaeda-backed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, or ISIS, 24 hours to surrender and leave the country, before arresting around 200 of them, spokesman Loauy Mokdad told CNN. ""Now, we repeat that we don't want any foreign fighters in Syria,"" Mokdad said, equating the ISIS fighters with the Syrian regime. ""We do not want any terrorist groups in Syria. We will not allow them to make bases in Syria."" The move comes as infighting between the Free Syrian Army and Islamist groups have threatened to tip the balance among rebel forces toward militant groups and away from more secular brigades. The FSA gave the ISIS an ultimatum and accused the group of killing FSA officers and committing crimes against civilians. ""After six months attempting to hijack our revolution and after they controlled some liberated areas and after they start to force our people to act like Islamic state, we gave so many warnings to them, that's something not acceptable for us,"" Mokdad said. In a sign of the escalating tensions, two Syrian human rights watchdogs claim that Islamic fighters with ISIS executed 30 people in the northern Syrian province of Idlib Saturday. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists, said that the 30 victims were ""field executed"" after being kidnapped at checkpoints in the province. The victims included civilians and fighters from rival factions, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. ISIS forces have increasingly come into conflict with FSA fighters and other hard-line anti-Assad factions while attempting to enforce their strict form of Islamic sharia law on areas coming under their control across northern Syria. ISIS on Saturday issued its own ultimatum Saturday, giving the FSA 24 hours to free their prisoners, or they will leave their joint posts with the FSA in Aleppo.","The Free Syrian Army wants to be rid of foreign fighters .

"""Teen Spirit"" and ""Good Times"" may be coming to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame -- sealed with a KISS. Grunge groundbreakers Nirvana, disco dynamos Chic and the costume-clad, Gene Simmons-led pop metal band KISS are among 16 nominees up for election in the museum's Class of 2014. The deep selection also includes '70s and '80s hitmakers Hall and Oates; college radio heroes the Replacements; New Orleans funkmeisters the Meters; sweet-voiced Linda Ronstadt; and pioneering gangsta rappers N.W.A. Completing the list: the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Deep Purple, Peter Gabriel, LL Cool J, Cat Stevens, Link Wray, Yes and the Zombies. The list spans more than six decades of rock and pop history and includes both major pop successes -- Chic, Hall and Oates, Gabriel, Ronstadt and Yes all hit No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart -- and influential players. Wray, for example, had just two Top 40 singles, ""Rumble"" and ""Raw-Hide,"" but his dirty, heavily distorted sound proved a precursor for every power-chording shredder who's ever picked up a guitar.

Members Ice Cube, Eazy-E and Dr. Dre all went on to even bigger things, with Dr. Dre, in particular, becoming perhaps the most notable producer in hip-hop history. Rock fans may be particularly invested in the fates of Nirvana, which kicked off the grunge era with its classic 1991 album ""Nevermind,"" and KISS, which -- despite mixed critical notices during its 1970s heyday -- built a roaring fan base called the ""KISS Army"" on the backs of incessant touring, pyrotechnic stage shows and several hit albums. As the Rock Hall says in a press release, ""Few bands short of the Beatles inspired more kids to pick up the guitar than KISS."" But the other nominees shouldn't be overlooked. Chic, known for such hits as ""Le Freak"" and ""Good Times,"" was perhaps the best of the disco groups, and its leaders -- guitarist Nile Rodgers, bassist Bernard Edwards and drummer Tony Thompson -- moved smoothly into the '80s thanks to their sleek studio work. The group's sound is still prominent: Rodgers recently popped up on the Chic-like Daft Punk single ""Get Lucky."" And the Replacements managed to combine affecting songwriting -- usually courtesy of Paul Westerberg -- with passionate (if occasionally shambling) performances, such as those heard on the songs ""I Will Dare,"" ""Unsatisfied"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait."" Besides, the hall may need to find a place for a band that titled an album, ""Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash."" Voting will be open to fans through December 10.

"The art of preparing, stuffing, and mounting animal skins is called taxidermy, and it can range from classy to creepy depending on whether your subject is a moose, or, say, a homeless drifter. Of course, proper taxidermy is primarily reserved for hunting and fishing trophies, and it sort of works like this: . Dave drinks two dozen Coors in the woods with friends. Dave shoots bear. Dave pays taxidermist to turn bear into furniture. Dave puts bear in living room. Dave's kids wet bed until they're 33. And that's if the mounting is done well. Because quality taxidermy really depends on the skill of the taxidermist, and a simple hunting mount can turn exponentially more creepy if it isn't done with precision or mild sobriety. ""Hey! Hey! Look what I made!"" ""Is that ... Danny DeVito looking for a contact lens?"" ""It's a deer."" But even for those of us who don't necessarily enjoy the idea of killing animals for the sake of impressing dinner guests, somehow it's not all that difficult to be amused by terrible craftsmanship . So, although I'm sort of weirded out by this practice (and, hey, to each their own) I can absolutely appreciate bad taxidermy. And, now, there's a new, popular Twitter feed about just that. It's called @CrapTaxidermy, and it's completely dedicated to images of the very worst animal mountings. Not to be confused with @MileyCyrus. The Twitter account was started by a guy in the UK named Nish, who requested to only be identified by a one-word name. Like Cher. Or Madonna. Or Steve from accounting. He loves taxidermy and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. Beyond that, we know very little about the man behind the account. But we do understand that Nish started the Twitter account only about a month ago, and was inspired by something that, really, all of us should get to see at some point in our lives. He explains: ""I started the page after I saw the pole dancing polar bear in a museum and thought poorly executed taxidermy might interest others."" And it does. Soon, people started catching on to his feed, especially in the last week. Which should help him keep it updated with new images going forward. Nish says, ""People send me pictures of creatures they have seen and all I do is post them on my Twitter with a hilarious caption."" Good effort! That said, Nish made it very clear to me that he is, in fact, an animal lover and does not condone hunting for sport or animal cruelty. But, you know, if you're gonna do it anyway ... how 'bout a photo? Bad taxidermy on the Web is actually nothing new. For example, about five years ago a woman in New York name Kat Su started a Tumblr blog called Crappy Taxidermy. It's all the same fun, but with an extra ""p"" and a ""y."" For those of you keeping score -- and God knows I am -- Crappy Taxidermy boasts itself as ""the Internet's oldest and largest image gallery of crappy and awesome taxidermy since 2009."" But Su has a wonderfully positive attitude about the new kid in town. ""We're completely unaffiliated,"" she says, adding ""I love what they're doing, though!"" Su explained that ""blogging isn't a zero sum game, and everyone wins when you spread the love for this particular type of taxidermy. I just like making people laugh."" And besides, things are going fairly well for Su. She even has a book coming out this fall. However, to confuse matters, the book is actually being titled ""Crap Taxidermy."" Just like Nish's twitter feed. The plot thickens. The reason for the name change, Su explained, is that her book is actually being published by a British publishing house, and that British people don't use the word ""crappy."" Which explains Nish's use of the word ""crap."" Of course, despite Su's carefree attitude toward Nish's Twitter feed, it might ultimately come to blows when the publishers get involved with marketing the book. In the meantime, Su maintains her day job as an active-wear designer, but says she's actually going to have to try her hand at taxidermy. For real. And there's no way out. For the book, she is going to write a tutorial on how to stuff a mouse. And her good friend, Daisy Tainton, happens to be an insect preparatory for the Museum of Natural History, and also a hobbyist taxidermist. Aren't we all? Tainton will be giving Su a private lesson at her apartment, and Su's only real concern is that she'll barf. Which would be bad. But, you know, if you're gonna do it anyway ... how 'bout a photo?

"He's been photographed dropping vases before -- but that doesn't mean it's OK for just anyone to do it. Ai Weiwei has made a name for himself by not only creating visually arresting and thought-provoking art, but for his uncompromising activism in opposition to the Chinese government. Ai was on the receiving end of a protest this weekend when a local Miami artist smashed a ""color basis"" vase valued at $1 million, part of the artist's ""According to what?"" exhibition at the Perez Art Museum Miami (PAMM) in the city. The exhibition also included photographs of the Chinese artist dropping what appears to be a Han Dynasty urn. Maximo Caminero, a Miami-based artist, was named in a police affidavit as the defendant. He told an officer that his act was a protest against the gallery's decision to only display international art. The police report states that Caminero picked up the vase before being advised to put it down by a museum official. He then dropped it ""in protest."" He was charged with criminal mischief. Questionable protest . Ai, meanwhile, told CNN that he didn't have ""much reaction"" to the news, but said that he thought that a line should be drawn when it came to damaging public or private property as part of a protest. ""I can't have a show in Beijing but I cannot go to museums to break work in Beijing,"" he said in a phone interview. ""My work is basically forbidden to be shown in China ... The protest itself may be valid but to damage somebody's work to do that is questionable."" Ai said that he considered his work -- specifically the triptych which shows him dropping an antique urn -- to be ""very different."" ""My work belongs to me, it doesn't belong to the public and also it doesn't [belong to] somebody else."" He said he believes he has been contacted by the gallery but he isn't taking the loss too seriously. ""I don't really care much and actually my work is often damaged in different shows, because it's fragile, so normally I don't take these things too highly. Damage is damage, you know. If they have insurance, maybe it will be covered."" Art in China: On script and cutting edge? Condemnation . The museum issued a statement concerning the incident, condemning Caminero's act. ""Although the museum can't speak directly to intentions, evidence suggests that this was a premeditated act,"" a PAMM statement read. ""As an art museum dedicated to celebrating modern and contemporary artists from within our community and around the world, we have the highest respect for freedom of expression, but this destructive act is vandalism and disrespectful to another artist and his work, to Perez Art Museum Miami, and to our community."" Caminero told the Miami New Times that ""it was a spontaneous protest"" and that he ""lifted the vase and let it smash on the floor like Weiwei did in his picture then waited for authorities peacefully and never resisted punishment.""

"(CNN) -- A Somali Islamist militant movement on Monday issued a statement claiming responsibility for a devastating trio of bombings that killed 74 people in Uganda's capital. ""We wage war against the 6,000 collaborators; they have received their response,"" the statement from Al-Shabaab read in apparent reference to the African Union peacekeeping force in Somalia that Uganda contributes troops to. Analyst Alex Vines, from London-based think tank Chatham House, told CNN that if Al-Shabaab did carry out the attacks there could be global implications as countries and businesses vie for opportunities across Africa. Why is Uganda important? Vines: Historically it's been important for the export of coffee and fish out of Lake Victoria, but now oil has been found, Uganda could become a significant, if not major, oil exporter. So there's much international interest, and not just western. The deal that's been struck with Tullow Oil looks as if it'll be farmed out to the French company Total and the Chinese state oil company CNOOC. So these attacks in Uganda could have global implications for business, be they Chinese or Western. Will they deter investors? Vines: I think investors will do a stricter risk assessment and practice due diligence. They will look at where they think it's safe for their workers to go and advise them to be careful when socializing at night, but I don't think it will stop investment at all. Does Uganda have a history of violence? Vines: Uganda has had a low-intensity conflict linked to the Lords Resistance Army (LRA), of Joseph Kony, but this has been much subdued in recent years. There have been recent acts of random terrorism in Kampala but nothing like that seen last night. (United Nations humanitarian chief Jan Egeland has described the 20-year conflict in northern Uganda between government forces and the LRA as the most neglected humanitarian crisis in the world. Kony has said he wants to rule Uganda according to the Ten Commandments but the LRA campaign has been marked by brutality, including the abduction of many school children with girls forced to be sex slaves and boys pressed into the guerrilla army.) Uganda is on the U.N. Security Council and is going to play a more global role as U.S. and other countries want to impose sanctions on countries like Iran and North Korea. Is Uganda's international role the reason it's been targeted? Vines: Al-Shabaab are the leading point of inquiry because of its previous threats against Uganda and because of its contributions to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the presence of the EU training mission in Mogadishu. Bomb belt found in Uganda attacks probe . I think Uganda has been targeted for these bombings because of its activities in Somalia. Uganda is on the Security Council but it is going to step down at the end of this year. So that's a transitory issue. Uganda certainly sees itself as playing a regional role: President Museveni was instrumental in pushing for U.N. sanctions on Eritrea that came into force earlier this year so clearly he has many enemies as well as friends. What are the implications of the attacks? Vines: If radical Islamist group Al-Shabaab is involved, this will be its first attack outside Somalia. If this is true the bombings will show it has the capability against soft targets outside Somalia. Also it's important to understand Somalia isn't a monolithic, single state. There's extreme violence in the south of the country but north of Mogadishu and in an area called Somaliland it's been pretty stable. In fact in Somaliland recently there's been an election with what looks like the peaceful transition of the head of state of that area. So this is a complicated region for sure. Is there any possibility of peace in Somalia? Vines: The West's policy is to support the transitional government in Mogadishu but it only controls a few streets. The part of Somalia around Mogadishu and to the south is controlled by Al-Shabaab, who do not recognize the transitional government and want to impose a strict Islamist code. My own personal view is that rather than ignoring al-Shabaab we should be discussing with them what they want. And in that way it's similar to the situation in Afghanistan with the Taliban ... the debate going there about whether one must engage with them rather than just fight them. The country remains very vulnerable and reliant on AU peacekeeping forces and AMISOM, which is what Uganda is part of, and I think that's why Uganda was attacked.","Somali militants claim reponsibility for bomb attacks that killed dozens in Uganda .

"(CNN) -- Germany's ruling coalition has agreed to shut down all of the nation's nuclear power plants by 2022. Minister of Ecology Norbert Roettgen of the Christian Democratic Union party made the announcement early Monday after negotiations with coalition partner, the Liberal Party, which had been opposed to setting a date for decommissioning the nuclear facilities. Opposition parties have long supported shuttering nuclear energy in Germany . ""The decision looks like this,"" Roettgen said. ""Seven older nuclear power plants ... and the nuclear plant Kruemmel will not go back online ... a second group of six nuclear reactors will go offline at the end of 2021 at the latest, and ... the three most modern, newest nuclear plants will go offline in 2022 at the latest."" To make up for the loss of nuclear energy, the German government will begin to switch to renewable energy and increase investments in energy research, the government website says. ""But we will not be able to do without conventional power plants, above all cutting-edge gas power plants for a long time,"" said a statement published last week. ""New fruits of new research should contribute to making the energy transition more efficient and easier on the ecology."" In March, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced she would rethink a plan to extend the lifespan of her country's nuclear power plants. ""The events in Japan have shown us that even things that seem all but impossible scientifically can in fact happen,"" Merkel said at a Berlin news conference. Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was damaged in a March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which has spewed large amounts of radiation into the environment. At the time, Merkel ordered a review of the nuclear plant safety standards, saying there would be ""no taboos in those reviews.""

"CIA contract security officers who responded to the terrorist attacks on the U.S. ambassador in Benghazi, Libya, last year were told by the CIA to sign nondisclosure agreements just before a memorial ceremony at the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, this past May, a congressional source told CNN. The source says this was disclosed by the contractors during closed-door testimony on Capitol Hill this week, and it seems to contradict information sent by CIA Director John Brennan to the House Intelligence Committee investigating the events in Benghazi. The CIA has repeatedly denied reports by CNN that the CIA has tried to prevent its personnel from talking to members of Congress investigating the September 2012 Benghazi attacks. When it was first reported by CNN, Brennan released a letter showing that he strongly encouraged CIA operatives to cooperate with congressional investigators. Brennan even went so far as to directly answer a question from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers who, in a September 3 letter to the CIA director, specifically asked this question: . ""Has any officer, either staff of contractor, been required to sign any nondisclosure agreement because of their presence at Benghazi or their participation in any activity related to the Benghazi attacks?"" Brennan's answer: ""No."" CIA contract operatives testifying before a classified House Intelligence subcommittee on Wednesday and Thursday directly contradicted Brennan's answer, a congressional source told CNN. CIA spokesman Todd Ebitz told CNN that ""there is absolutely no contradiction."" ""CIA contractors routinely sign secrecy agreements, which are standard forms. No CIA officer has ever signed a secrecy agreement that referenced Benghazi or that prohibited them from talking to Congress,"" Ebitz said in a statement. ""In fact, CIA secrecy agreements specifically note an officer's right to bring issues to the attention of Congress. Furthermore, Director Brennan extended to all Benghazi survivors an invitation to speak to Congress and indicated the Agency would support their interaction.  Several have spoken to CIA's oversight committees."" All five operatives were part of a security team hired by the CIA to protect its operations during missions in Libya. 'We were wrong': CBS's Lara Logan apologizes for Benghazi report . The official nondisclosure forms did not specifically mention the Benghazi investigation, but the source told CNN, ""There is not a person in Washington, D.C. who doesn't understand why the forms were put in front of these people."" The Weekly Standard first reported the signing of additional nondisclosure agreements on Thursday. Mark Zaid, an attorney representing three of the CIA contractors, told the Weekly Standard, ""There is no doubt that the NDAs (nondisclosure agreements) would not have been presented to them had it not been for Benghazi. That is their impression and my analysis based on 20 years of experience."" Zaid continued, ""the NDAs in no way changed the legal landscape. They had already signed NDAs that bound them to certain obligations. These new ones were legally unnecessary."" The CIA contractors told to sign the nondisclosure agreements were attending a memorial service for Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, two CIA operatives who died in the Benghazi attacks. This week, the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Oversight met to hear closed-door testimony from the former security agents. Though the testimony is secret, the congressional source with inside knowledge of the hearing told CNN, ""There now appears to be serious discrepancies"" between what the CIA has officially reported to Congress and what the witnesses are telling members of the committee. CNN has learned a rescue team of five CIA operatives were armed and ready to respond to the terrorist attack within minutes of the first  radio communication from Ambassador Christopher Stevens' compound, but CNN sources say the agents were told to stand down. The allegation was first raised last year, after which the CIA told Congress there was no order to stand down. The CIA has said ""no one at any level in the CIA told anybody not to help those in need; claims to the contrary are simply inaccurate."" Members of the House Intelligence Subcommittee believe they need to have more information to determine why a discrepancy now exists between the would-be rescuers on the ground and the official reports from the CIA. The agents eventually did respond to the attack, pulling off a heroic attempt to save U.S. State Department officials who were under siege. Intelligence officials explained last year that there was a roughly 25-minute gap from the initial call for help to when half a dozen officers were able to make a move -- and that the delay was due to the time it took to load weapons and equipment and coordinate with friendly militias.","CIA has said contractors not required to sign nondisclosure forms about Benghazi .

"President Barack Obama still has a long way to go to secure congressional authorization for military action against Syria even after clearing a key hurdle in the Senate. According to CNN, there are 18 ""no"" votes in the Senate and 24 ""yes."" Fifty-eight senators -- almost the same number of votes needed to overcome any filibuster -- remain undecided. After changing an Obama-sponsored proposal authorizing a military response to alleged chemical weapons use by Syria, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted on Wednesday to approve it by a 10-7 margin. The outcome set up debate next week in the full chamber. CNN vote count: How the Senate will vote | House . Three Republicans -- Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee -- voted in favor of taking action. And that's where the good news ends for the White House. Obama needs at least 217 votes in the House to secure his resolution. In that chamber, there are nearly four ""no"" votes for every ""yes"" at the moment. According to CNN's count, 109 members plan to vote ""no,"" while 23 -- including a number of high profile Republicans -- plan to back it. More than 280 representatives remain undecided. Of concern to the administration is a trend showing an increase in ""no"" votes, although lawmakers remain out of town until next week and many have yet to receive classified briefings where the administration says it can spell out more evidence and more candidly answer questions. Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security committee, Rep. Bob Gibbs and Rep. Cynthia Lummis are among those who have come out against the plan. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican, signaled through a spokesman on Wednesday that she was planning to vote ""yes."" But the same official said on Thursday that she wanted to first see the resolution language and was now undecided. Those decisions put those lawmakers at odds with their leadership since House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor have backed Obama. Boehner has said it is up to the White House to get the votes. House Democrats, too, have reservations about Syria. Many, especially liberals, cite war weariness and prolonged intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan as reasons to oppose new military action. Others want to hear more details in classified meetings or see resolution language, which in the Senate would limit any strike, set a time limit for action, and prohibit the use of American troops in Syria. ""After 6,668 American troop deaths and tens of thousands of American wounded, after spending $2 trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan representing $40,000 in debt for every American family, now is the time to nation-build in America and invest in the growth of the American economy,"" New York Rep. Brian Higgins, a Democrat, said in a statement to CNN. Despite the vocal opposition in Congress, Obama remained confident he'd get the necessary support. ""I believe Congress will approve it because I think America recognizes that as difficult as it is to take any military action and even one as limited as we are talking about, even one without boots on the ground, that's a sober decision,"" he said at a news conference on Wednesday in Sweden.","Most senators undecided on how they'll vote on Syria .

"The uptick in attacks by Afghan security forces against coalition troops has hit home, with all troops at NATO headquarters and all bases across Afghanistan now ordered to carry loaded weapons around the clock, CNN learned Friday. Gen. John Allen, the NATO commander in Afghanistan, ordered the move, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the orders. The order, made in recent days, was divulged amid two more so-called green-on-blue or insider attacks Friday. An Afghan police officer opened fire on U.S. troops in Farah province in southwestern Afghanistan, killing two service members, the NATO-led command said. Two International Security Assistance Force troops and an Afghan service member were wounded by another Afghan service member in Kandahar province, in the south. The order comes as coalition forces adopt and study measures aimed at thwarting such attacks. In Afghan combat situations, all troops are armed.  But at other locations, only base security forces had been regularly armed. Those troops have been called into action when insurgents have launched attacks on the base. Coalition steps up fight against Afghan 'green-on-blue' attacks . Now, anyone who goes to the base headquarters would see that all troops, regardless of their tasks, carry weapons with a magazine of ammunition attached, a U.S. official confirmed. Troops now could fire against an attacker within seconds by sliding a lever on their weapons to make a round drop into the firing chamber. Loaded weapons are being carried both in the open outdoor areas of the base and inside buildings and meeting rooms. Allen and his top commanders live and work at the Kabul NATO headquarters, attached to the U.S. Embassy. The Friday green-on-blue attacks follow a claim purportedly from Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar that fighters are infiltrating Afghan security forces to attack NATO-led forces on their bases. ""Many Afghans in the rank and files of the enemy have shown a willingness to help the (Taliban) in a shrewd manner,"" said a statement posted on militant websites Thursday and obtained by SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors the activities of militant groups on the Web. ""As a result, the foreign invaders and their allies at their military centers and bases are suffering crushing blows by these heroic soldiers."" CNN can't independently verify the authenticity of the statement, which was released in advance of this weekend's Eid al Fitr celebrations that mark the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The Taliban are known routinely to claim responsibility for attacks and inflate casualty numbers. Omar also urged employees of the Afghan government to seek out the group's newly established ""Call and Guidance, Luring and Integration"" departments that have been established throughout the country ""so that they may leave the enemy ranks and join the fighters,"" according to SITE. Omar's statement drew a sharp response from Allen, who accused the Taliban leader of issuing ""an unmistakable message of death, hate and hopelessness for the Afghan people"" on the eve of the Eid celebrations. ""The pride of the Afghan people has been smeared by killers who pose as soldiers and police, yet they represent the worst of humanity,"" Allen said Friday. The commander accused of Omar of sending ""young brainwashed men to carry out attacks in a fruitless cause,"" while he ""rests comfortably from afar."" ""He professes love for his fighters, yet he sends them to their deaths by the hundreds. Where is the vision that Omar speaks of? Where is the love he professes for the Afghan people?"" Allen said. ""Are these not the acts of a deranged man who puts his own goals of personal domination ahead of the future of the Afghan people?"" Shootings by Afghan forces take growing toll on NATO troops . An estimated 101 NATO troops have been killed in green-on-blue attacks since May 2007 across the country, military analyst Bill Roggio said Friday. Roggio, managing editor of the Long War Journal blog, which reports and analyzes terror issues, said green-on-blue attacks have caused around 13% of coalition deaths this year. Of the green-on-blue attacks since 2007, about 40% of the deaths have occurred this year and 35% occurred last year, he said. Roggio said there was a flurry of insider attacks early in the year, then a lull, and now a flareup in recent days. Green-on-blue is military lingo, with green a reference to Afghan forces and blue to coalition troops. "" 'Blue' is always the color of the friendly force, i.e. NATO/ISAF; 'Red' signifies the enemy force; and 'Green' is the indigenous force allied with, but separate to, the friendly force. In this case, 'Green' is the ANSF,"" said Maj. Adam Wojack, a media officer with the International Security Assistance Force, referring to the Afghan National Security Forces. The U.S. military is starting to use the term ""insider attack"" rather than ""green-on-blue"" because it's easier to understand and because Afghan troops have been victims of the attacks. The NATO-led command did not provide details about the deadly attack in Farah, but a provincial police chief told CNN that an Afghan policeman shot the American service members early Friday during a training session in the Bala Boluk district. Police Chief Aqa Noor Kintos said two U.S. Special Forces members were killed and another was injured. The gunman was killed when troops returned fire, he said. During the gunfight, an Afghan National Police member was also killed, and another was injured, he said. Lt. Col. Hagen Messer, a NATO-led command spokesman, confirmed that two U.S. service members were killed in the attack. The Taliban claimed responsibility in a text message to journalists, saying a 70-year-old policeman killed the three troops. It's the second time a man in an Afghan security uniform has opened fire on coalition troops in the Bala Boluk district. In December 2011, a gunman posing as an Afghan soldier wounded coalition troops. Official: Man in Afghan security uniform kills 3 U.S. troops . In the Kandahar incident, the member of the Afghan National Army who turned his weapon against coalition forces was shot and later died of his wounds after he was taken to an ISAF medical facility. The incident occurred in the province's Zharay district, ISAF said. The frequency of the insider attacks has prompted Afghan intelligence agents to go undercover during recruit training to spot possible extremists, military officials said. Allen said coalition officials were working on a new procedure to check the backgrounds of Afghans who sign up for the army or police force. The U.S. government has offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of Omar, who took over Afghanistan in the early 1990s and established a hard-line Islamic fundamentalist regime that gave shelter to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. Omar vanished from public view after a U.S.-led coalition ousted the Taliban and its leaders from power in Afghanistan in December 2001 for refusing to hand over bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks. Over the years, he has refused to be photographed or filmed, and has rarely traveled. As a result, Omar's appearance has remained a mystery to many. Those who have met Omar say he has one eye stitched shut, the result of a wound suffered during a battle with Soviet troops during their occupation of Afghanistan. There have been conflicting reports about Omar's fate. As late as last year, the Taliban denied reports the leader was dead. The attacks come a day after a helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan killed seven U.S. service members, three Afghan soldiers and an Afghan interpreter. Authorities are investigating whether the crash was caused by technical problems or a shoot-down.","NATO official's order was made in recent days as concern mounted over the attacks .

"Chuck Colson, a Watergate-era ""hatchet man"" for President Richard Nixon who became an influential evangelical leader after serving time in prison, died Saturday afternoon, according to his website. He was 80. His death came just over three weeks after he ""was overcome by dizziness"" while speaking at a conference and rushed to a northern Virginia hospital. Surgeons operated on him for two hours for a brain hemorrhage . ""At times, Chuck showed encouraging indicators of a possible recovery, but his health took a decided turn, and he went to be with the Lord,"" said the statement on his Website. News of his death soon stirred tributes particularly from leaders in conservative circles and the evangelical community, with David Frum -- a former special assistant to President George W. Bush and a CNN contributor -- saying on Twitter that Colson made his ""greatest impact when furthest from power."" ""Today the world lost a Christian statesman, a dedicated servant of prisoners and a powerful example of God's ability to transform a life,"" said Lamar Vest, president and CEO of the New York-based American Bible Society. And Pat Buchanan, a conservative leader who called Colson ""a tremendously good friend of mine"" during their time together in the Nixon administration, called him ""a real example of redemption."" ""I think his life is a model for people who got themselves into trouble,"" Buchanan told CNN on Saturday after a panel at New York's Columbia University. Rick Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania who curried conservative support in his run for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, described Colson as ""a humble man who learned from his own frailty to care for the 'least of these,' especially prisoners."" And Mitt Romney, who is expected to officially secure the GOP nod at this summer's convention, offered his prayers to Coulson's kin and ""all the people he touched."" ""Chuck Colson embodied and made possible an immeasurable amount of good in the lives of the people, families and communities he served in bringing a message of faith and hope,"" the former Massachusetts governor said in a statement. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R- Kentucky, described Colson's story as ""a constant and necessary reminder to those of us in and out of public office of the seductions of power and the rewards of service."" ""His famous redemption story and tireless advocacy on behalf of the marginalized and the outcast have called all of us to a deeper reflection on our lives and priorities,"" McConnell said. ""He lives on as a modern model of redemption and a permanent rebuttal to the cynical claim that there are no second chances in life."" A former U.S. Marine captain, Colson was considered a main player in the Nixon White House's dirty tricks during the rough-and-tumble politics of the Vietnam era in America. Not tied directly to the June 17, 1972, break-in to Democratic National Committee offices in Washington's Watergate complex, Colson was implicated in the broader political scandal and became the first Nixon aide to be convicted. While indicted, he negotiated with prosecutors and pleaded guilty in 1974 to obstruction of justice for attempting to defame anti-war activist Daniel Ellsberg, who had leaked the once-secret Pentagon Papers that revealed the full extent of U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia. He served seven months in prison before being paroled in 1975. As he prepared to leave, he promised fellow inmates that he would not forget them or his experience there, his official biography says. Colson went on, in 1976, to found Prison Fellowship. The nonprofit group provides support for inmates in the form of in-prison Bible studies, mentoring programs and support for the children of prisoners. Today, the organization calls itself ""the world's largest outreach to prisoners, ex-prisoners and their families,"" with a presence in 113 countries. Colson himself spoke out in a daily radio commentary called ""BreakPoint,"" which aired on stations nationwide. And he also founded The Chuck Colson Center for Christian Worldview, which seeks ""the transformation of believers as they apply biblical thinking to all of life"" in part through offerings on ""today's news and trends via radio, interactive media, and print. In 2008, Colson was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal for ""his good heart and his compassionate efforts to renew a spirit of purpose in the lives of countless individuals,"" according to the White House website under then-President Bush. According to his biography, Colson ""admits he was guilty of political 'dirty tricks'' and willing to do almost anything for the cause of his president and his party."" But he always denied a quote often attributed to him that he was willing to ""walk over his own grandmother to get Nixon re-elected.""","Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney and evangelical leaders pay tribute .

"MEXICO CITY (CNN) -- The death toll in a plane crash that claimed the life of Mexico's interior minister and two other high-ranking officials has risen to 13, Mexico City prosecutor Miguel Angel Mancera said Wednesday, according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. The scene of Tuesday night's plane crash in Mexico City was one of panic and confusion, a witness says. The small plane carrying Interior Minister Juan Camilo Mourino and seven others crashed in central Mexico City on Tuesday night. A witness described ""moments of panic and confusion"" after the crash, as burning people asked for help and others ran from the scene. The crash injured 40 people on the ground, said government spokesman Marcelo Ebrard. All eight passengers and crew on board the plane were killed, the spokesman said. Two of the dead are women, Mancera said. Also among the dead were Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos, a former deputy attorney general, and Miguel Monterubio Cubas, the director of social communication, President Felipe Calderon said in a televised address Tuesday night. In Mexico, the minister of the interior oversees domestic affairs, particularly national security, law enforcement and the war on drugs. It is Mexico's second-most-powerful post. Vasconcelos was one of Mexico's top experts on the fight against narcotraffickers and was said to have a price on his head. ""I want to express my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and my absolute support during this difficult time,"" Calderon said. Mourino, he said, ""was one of my closest colleagues and one of my best friends. ... With his death, Mexico loses a great Mexican."" At least 12 cars were burned and two buildings were damaged, Notimex said.  Watch video footage of the aftermath of the crash » . No cause for the crash was immediately given, but Calderon assured the nation that the results of the investigation will be made public. The Learjet 45 did not explode in the air, said Luis Tellez, secretary of communication and transportation. When there is an explosion in the air, Tellez said at a news conference Wednesday, pieces of the airplane are scattered over a wide area. But the wreckage in this instance was limited to a small area, he said. Tellez said Wednesday the pilot did not report an emergency, Notimex said. An audio recording released Wednesday of what Mexican officials said was dialogue between the pilot and the airport control tower did not appear to have an emergency call from the aircraft. The recording could be linked to off the Notimex Web site. The plane was traveling from the north-central city of San Luis Potosi to Mexico City, Calderon said. The cities are about 220 miles (355 km) apart. The Learjet was built in 1998 and carried identification call letters of XCVMC, Tellez said. Agustin Arellano, director of the federal agency that oversees Mexican airspace, said the aircraft's flight path, altitude and velocity were within accepted standards for a landing at Mexico City's Benito Juarez International Airport. The information was retrieved from the airplane's flight data recorder, Arellano said at the news conference with Tellez. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it has sent a team of investigators, led by senior aviation accident investigator Joe Sedora. The team includes technical advisers from the NTSB, the Federal Aviation Administration, Learjet and Honeywell International, it said. Mourino had just given a speech in San Luis Potosi, detailing the administration's efforts to combat drug traffickers, kidnappers and other criminals. When Calderon took office in December 2006, Mourino said, the new president focused on combating crime. ""It was decided to combat criminal groups with all available power in order to confront them, to reduce them and to fulfill the essential mandate of all authority, which is none other than to guarantee peace, tranquility and security for its citizens,"" Mourino said in his speech. Calderon has unleashed federal police and soldiers in several states across Mexico and tightened controls on money laundering and corruption among local and municipal police forces, which have been infiltrated by drug traffickers. The effort has resulted in widespread carnage, with more than 3,000 deaths this year. At the scene of Tuesday's crash, taxi driver Raymundo Bernal, 28, told Notimex that he witnessed the event. ""I heard a strong roar and then saw four people who were burning and asking for help while the rest ran and the tops of trees were burning,"" he said. ""The ambulances took 10 minutes to arrive, but several of the people who were burning were not moving, and what followed were moments of panic and confusion."" More than 100 federal police secured the area, while the military took control of the airport at San Luis Potosi, Notimex said. Mourino, 37, studied in the United States, receiving an undergraduate degree in economics from the University of Tampa. He did post-graduate studies in accounting and finance from the Universidad Autonoma de Campeche, his government biography says. After serving in municipal government in Campeche, Mourino was a regional coordinator for Vicente Fox's successful presidential candidacy in 2000. He later served in the Mexican federal congress and in the Cabinet. He was chief of the president's office from December 2006 to January 2008.","NEW: U.S. agency sends investigative team to help .

"This week, Republicans announced their new budget with a highly produced video full of great rhetoric and patriotic music, but one major piece of Americana is missing -- a single mention of the middle class. The narrator, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, had promised to offer a ""path to prosperity"" but instead introduces economic policies that represent a dead end for America's middle class and American manufacturing. Rarely has a budget been so brazen about protecting the richest and most powerful at the expense of the rest. Ryan, considered by many to be an ideological leader of conservative thought, correctly asserts that this is a moment for America to choose between different futures. He then outlines the conservative vision that Americans have rejected over and over again -- increasing U.S. debt through special deals to protect the most powerful corporations and dumping that burden onto the already struggling middle class. Though Ryan's plan has deliberately avoided explaining how the tax numbers add up, in order to pay for the massive tax cuts at the top, everyone else would have to pay more. It's likely that a middle-class family with two kids making about $70,000 a year would pay about $1,150 more in income tax, according to calculations made by the Center for American Progress. That's an 80% increase over what they pay now, while millionaires will pay less. That same family currently receives about $5,500 worth of federal support from K-12 education, transportation, health and science research, consumer safety, natural resource protections and federal law enforcement. The GOP budget would cut these ""nondefense discretionary spending"" by about 25%, taking away a typical family's services and protections by about $1,400 per year.  To borrow a phrase from Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, these budget priorities are truly ""of the 1%, by the 1% and for the 1%."" Opinion: GOP budget will tackle economic challenges . House Republicans further threaten the middle class by rewarding companies for sending American jobs overseas. They want to revive the outsourcing loopholes that Democrats, including myself, have fought hard to close. These loopholes would exempt overseas profits from taxes, creating a greater incentive to relocate investments to other countries and leaving more of the tax burden to our middle class. But this goes beyond economics to our values. Why else would Father Thomas Kelly, a constituent of Ryan's and a Catholic priest, be moved to note his disappointment with the ""cruel budget plan"" that doesn't match the Catholic teaching of ""justice for the poor and economic fairness""? The Republicans' budget video shows a suburban family arriving home in a Volkswagen, rather than a Chrysler or a Buick. One can logically conclude that this was a self-conscious decision not to use a product of the American auto industry that their party and likely nominee, Mitt Romney, said should be allowed to die. The Republicans present a hypothetical choice going forward, but this reminds Americans that there were real choices already made over the last few years -- whether to let America crash into a Depression, permit our auto industry to fail or let Medicare for senior citizens become insolvent by 2017. At each of these points, as now, conservatives have put the political gain of making Barack Obama a one-term president by opposing his efforts to save the economy and fix Medicare, ahead of making tough decisions to protect the middle class and senior citizens. The Republican budget is not a cruel joke. It is the very real and logical result of the economic theory that conservatives from Ryan to Romney embrace -- that it is the richest Americans who create jobs and add to the economy, not the middle class. This is not a ""bold and right"" call for shared sacrifice as Romney suggested of last year's similar budget. It is simply forcing the middle class and senior citizens to take a hit to protect corporate subsidies and tax breaks for the rich and powerful. Many, including myself, had hoped for big ideas, but instead we got a new turn on an old congressional one -- a bridge to nowhere for 99% of Americans.","Tom Perriello: House GOP's new budget plan dumps more of tax burden on the middle class .

"The death rate due to cancer has declined in the United States in recent years, largely due to better prevention and treatment. In fact, 650,000 lives were spared from cancer between 1990 to 2005, according to new statistics from the American Cancer Society. Experts say prevention and improved treatment has lowered the U.S. cancer death rate. During the 15-year period, the cancer death rate among men dropped by 19.2 percent, mainly due to decreases in lung, prostate, and colon cancer deaths. In women, the cancer death rate fell by 11.4 percent, largely due to a drop in breast and colorectal cancer deaths. ""This is good news because cancer death rates have continued to decrease since the early 1990s because of prevention and improved treatment for many cancers,"" said lead author Dr. Ahmedin Jemal, the strategic director of cancer surveillance at the American Cancer Society in Atlanta, Georgia. ""We have to be optimistic based on the trends. We are on the right track."" The findings are published in the July/August issue of CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians. Despite the optimism, however, there is still much work to be done to win the war on cancer, experts stress. There will be close to 1.5 million new cancer diagnoses in the U.S. in 2009, and 562,340 people are expected to die of the disease. This means that more than 1,500 people will die of cancer each day in 2009; the most common lethal cancers in men and women are lung, prostate, breast, and colon cancers. Health.com: How to avoid colorectal cancer . A drop in hormone replacement therapy leads to a decline in breast cancer cases . The decrease in deaths from breast cancer accounted for 37 percent of the reduction in the death rate among women during the 15-year period. ""Any life spared from cancer or serious illness is a victory, but success comes in little steps -- one life at a time,"" said Dr. Marisa Weiss, the president and founder of advocacy group Breastcancer.org and the author of several books, including Taking Care of Your Girls: A Breast Health Guide for Girls, Teens, and In-Betweens.  Weiss is also the director of breast radiation oncology and breast health outreach at Lankenau Hospital in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania. ""It's great news that a large chunk of the decreased death rates in women can be attributed to breast cancer,"" she said. This is largely due to a decreased use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which has been shown to increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. HRT fell from grace after a large government-funded study known as the Women's Health Initiative was stopped early because the risks of HRT, including an increased risk of breast cancer, greatly outnumbered the benefits of the therapy. Health.com: What breast cancer really feels like . Another reason for the decline in breast cancer deaths, however, is delayed diagnosis due to the fact that many women are not getting their yearly X-ray or mammogram. ""Fewer women are getting mammography and that's why fewer women are getting diagnosed with breast cancer, so eventually that will come back and bite us in the rear end,"" Weiss said. Black women continue to die of breast cancer at a greater rate than their white counterparts, she pointed out. What's more, the current obesity epidemic may fuel a rise in the rates. ""Fat makes extra hormones, which lead to extra cell activity and extra abnormal cell activity,"" she said. ""Fat is a storing facility for hormonally active pollutants, so if you are overweight, you're more likely to hold on to some chemicals in the environment that enter your body from food and water."" Health.com: How to keep your food cravings at bay while you lose weight . And that's not all: ""Fat brings on puberty earlier and early puberty is a risk factor for breast cancer,"" Weiss said. ""These areas of disappointment are areas of opportunity,"" she added. But greater efforts are needed to encourage healthy eating and exercise to help combat obesity, especially in adolescents, she said. Health.com: Melt pounds with mix-and-match cardio routines . Another encouraging sign is a drop in colorectal cancer deaths due to better and more widespread screening. ""Colorectal cancer screening saves lives because it detects cancer at early stages when treatment is more effective, and it also removes precancerous lesions,"" said Jemal. The current recommendation for people at average risk of colon cancer is to get regular screening tests starting at age 50. Not all good news . Death rates from breast and colon cancers are falling, but the death rates from pancreatic (women), liver (men and women), and esophageal cancer (men) are increasing -- largely because of the obesity epidemic. Among men, death rates for the fatal form of skin cancer melanoma are also on the rise. Although there has been a decrease in lung cancer deaths among men (due to smoking-cessation efforts), the death rates for women with lung cancer are still on the rise. Lung cancer is expected to account for 26 percent of all cancer deaths in women in 2009, according to the new statistics. Health.com: My smoker's cough turned out to be emphysema . ""We haven't seen a decrease here yet, but cigarette smoking in women peaked about 20 years later than it did in men,"" Jemal said.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- CNN was targeted Thursday by attempts to interrupt its news Web site, resulting in countermeasures that caused the service to be slow or unavailable to some users in limited areas of Asia. CNN took preventative measures to filter traffic in response to attempts to disrupt its Web site. ""CNN took preventative measures to filter traffic in response to attempts to disrupt our Web site. A small percentage of CNN.com users in Asia are impacted,"" the network said in a statement. ""We do not know who is responsible, nor can we confirm where it came from,"" the statement continued. A CNN spokesman said the Web site began to notice problems around midday Thursday and took measures to isolate the trouble by limiting the number of users who could access it from specific geographic areas. As a result, he said, some users in those areas experienced temporary slowdowns or problems accessing the site. The spokesman could not offer an estimate of how many users were affected. However, he said that the impact on daily usage was ""imperceptible"" and that the site ""at no time"" went down. Service had returned to normal by mid-morning Friday, he said. The attempt came as tech-oriented Web sites in Asia were reporting calls from hacker groups in China for denial-of-service attacks to be launched against the CNN Web site on Saturday over the network's coverage of unrest in Tibet. Angry Chinese bloggers have accused CNN and several other Western news organizations of being unfair in covering recent pro-independence protests in Tibet, which is controlled by China. In response, the network released a statement noting that ""CNN's reputation is based on reporting global news accurately and impartially, while our coverage through the use of words, images or video always reflects a wide range of opinions and points of view on every story.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A 60-day countdown to the end of the ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in the U.S. military has begun, President Barack Obama announced Friday. Obama, with his top men at the Pentagon, formally ""certified"" to Congress that the present ""don't ask-don't tell"" policy will end in mid-September without harming ""military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion and recruiting and retention of the Armed Forces."" Pentagon officials briefing reporters admitted there is still work to be done. Although more than 1.9 million military personnel, out of a total of 2.2 million, have been trained in the new policy, there is still more training to be done. In addition, there are open questions about benefits for same-sex partners, such as health coverage and housing allowances. And the Pentagon admitted that although the policy is set to end September 20, the lawyers still have to figure out exactly when on that day the controversial rules will change. This 60-day clock and the shared sign-off by Obama, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen were choreographed to allow the services to complete training and fine-tune rules over the next two months. This comes as one of the first major actions by Panetta, who has been on the job for three weeks. He was ceremonially sworn in Friday morning by Vice President Joe Biden in the underground Pentagon Auditorium just hours before certifying that the repeal could go forward. He did not appear at the briefing. ""Today, as a result of strong leadership and proactive education throughout the force, we can take the next step in this process,"" Panetta said in a statement. The 9th Circuit's Court of Appeals issued a ruling Friday extending its stay -- first issued in November 1, 2010 -- to keep the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy in effect, even as it acknowledged ""the government's likelihood of success on the merits."" More significantly, though, the court added it would prohibit ""the government from investigating, penalizing or discharging anyone from the military pursuant to"" the policy. That means the government cannot target gays and lesbians who are serving in the military, even over the next 60 days. Pentagon officials at the Friday briefing said there would be no separate quarters or bathrooms based on sexual orientation under the new policy. It has been a long and hotly disputed process since a lame-duck Congress passed legislation repealing ""don't ask, don't tell"" and Obama signed it into law just before Christmas. As the military spent seven months deliberately moving toward repeal, a parallel battle in the federal courts further muddied the issue with a series of whiplash rulings that ended and then reimposed the policy. And while the military has saluted smartly and gone about changing the rules and telling the troops they better listen or else, the critics keep coming. Pentagon officials said the service chiefs and the combatant commanders had unanimously agreed that their branches were ready for repeal. But some members of Congress want to know if the top military brass opposed the actual policy change and warned of adverse consequences. ""The president's certification culminates a flawed repeal assessment and adoption process and as such the House Armed Services Committee will continue to conduct vigorous oversight,"" the committee chairman, Howard ""Buck"" McKeon, R-California, said Friday. ""I am calling on the administration to immediately release to Congress each of the assessments performed by the services on the impact of repeal on their forces and all the regulations and policy documents that demonstrate the questions about implementation have been resolved,"" said in a statement e-mailed by his office. Across the Capitol and across the aisle, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, applauded the action Friday as the end of a discriminatory policy. ""It is a fact that gay and lesbian service members have fought and died for our country and are serving in our military now,"" Levin said in a statement. ""But the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy requires them to conceal their sexual orientation so that they can continue their service to our nation."" Department of Defense General Counsel Jeh Johnson said he is aware that some members of Congress want to know what the top brass thought of the repeal. ""That request has been made. It has been made by people on the (Capitol) Hill as well and it is under consideration,"" Johnson said. Mike Almy, who was kicked out of the Air Force five years ago under the ""don't ask"" policy, called it a historic day, a step toward equality for gay and lesbians Americans serving in their country's uniform. Almy told CNN he can't wait to reapply to the military. ""This is long overdue,"" he said. ""This law has weakened national security and harmed our defense and thrown out 14,000 people."" But Elaine Donnelly, who heads a group called Center for Military Readiness, sharply criticized the administration for what she called a political payoff to left-wing activists in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. ""On the day that President Obama signs a paper 'certifying' that no harm will come to the military when repeal is implemented, he will own the San Francisco military that he has created,"" Donnelly said in a release. ""Mr. Panetta is beginning his term as defense secretary by letting down military men, women, and families who were led to believe that their views would be heard and respected. Instead, trusting personnel who participated in the 2010 surveys and focus groups in good faith were misused as props to create the impression that military people 'don't care' about this issue,"" Donnelly said. Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Steven Hummer said Friday that the Army, National Guard and Reserves will complete their training for the new policy by August 15. It has been widely understood that the Navy, Marines and Air Force -- all smaller than the Army -- completed their training as early as the end of June. Over the next two months the Defense Department will continue to study and fine-tune preparations for the change, as well as review existing benefits and how they can be altered. The military is toeing an optimistic line that changes can be accomplished without major disruption or embarrassing incidents. ""This undertaking is a fine example of how the services can come together to get a mission accomplished, deliberately, effectively and efficiently,"" Hummer said. ""I know the good work will continue.""","NEW: A U.S. Appeals Court bars ""penalizing or discharging anyone"" for violating the policy .

"(CNN) -- Three officials in a Los Angeles suburb whose high salaries sparked statewide outrage will step down from their jobs, the city's mayor said Friday. Oscar Hernandez, the mayor of Bell, California, said the City Council accepted the resignations of City Manager Robert Rizzo, Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia, and Police Chief Randy Adams, who reportedly had a combined salary of more than $1.6 million. He added that the three will not get severance pay. ""Today, our city council took the quick and decisive action that is in the best interest of our city so that we may return our attention to delivering outstanding city services,"" the mayor said in a statement posted on the city clerk's website. ""We recognize that today's economic climate and the financial hardships so many families are suffering put our past compensation decisions in a new light. To the residents of Bell, we apologize. We are confident that your pride in our great city endures and that the city's financial health and superior public services demonstrate that our priorities remain intact."" But Hernandez also praised Rizzo and called the Los Angeles Times story and the resulting uproar that led to the resignations ""unfair and unwarranted."" The salaries have infuriated many in California. Jerry Brown, California's attorney general, issued a statement Thursday saying that his office had launched a investigation into the salaries. The Los Angeles Times reported that Rizzo had an annual salary of nearly $800,000 a year, ""making him the highest-paid city manager in the state."" Citing the newspaper, Brown's statement said Adams had an annual salary of $457,000 and Spaccia received $376,288 a year. ""Most city council members are paid nearly $100,000 for their part-time jobs,"" the attorney general said. ""These outrageous salaries in Bell are shocking and beyond belief,"" he said. ""With record deficits and painful budget cuts facing California cities, astronomical local government salaries raise serious questions and demand a thorough investigation."" ""It's shocking. How did they get it?"" Cory Christ, a resident of the city, said to CNN affiliate KTLA. ""They're making more than the president -- it's totally not fair,"" California Assemblyman Hector De La Torre, who represents the district that encompasses Bell, also voiced outrage. ""The city council salaries and the outrageous salaries for the staff have really riled up the community,"" he told CNN recently. ""... It's a working class community. They're busy just trying to survive in this tough economic climate."" De La Torre said the median yearly income in the southern California town is under $35,000 a year. ""Just to put it in context, the general fund for the city of Bell is $15 million. So, Mr. Rizzo with his salary and compensation package, around $800,000 is about one-fifteenth of the budget for the city of Bell,"" De La Torre said. ""And Mr. Rizzo is obviously a little delusional about what the private sector would be (able) to pay anybody, certainly not $800,000. Certainly not double what the president of the United States"" makes. In his statement, Hernandez said the Times' ""coverage and the contrived uproar the Times sought to provoke are unfair and unwarranted"" and praised Rizzo. Hernandez said the salaries ""have been in line with similar positions over the period of their tenure"" and that Rizzo gave the town 15 years of balanced budgets after a $20 million shortfall. ""While other cities are defaulting on their commitments, borrowing to maintain city services or even threatening bankruptcy, Bell has a healthy surplus that has enabled us to ride out the nation's fiscal storm and even expand services to meet the growing needs of our low-income residents through the city food bank and programs for youth and seniors. ""While other municipalities are shuttering their libraries and shutting down their parks and services, Bell's parents know their children have access to services and activities that keep them safe -- especially during the summer months when school is out and working parents are not at home during the day."" Hernandez appointed Pedro Carrillo, assistant to the city manager, to be the interim city manager. ""We acknowledge that the actions taken today are not a panacea, but a first step towards healing our city and getting back to business that ensures the safety and well-being of our residents,"" the mayor said.","The state attorney general says the salaries are ""beyond belief""

"Retired army Gen. Otto Perez Molina was sworn in as Guatemala's president Saturday, pledging to take a tough stand on crime amid growing insecurity in the Central American nation. ""We have a country in crisis ... a nation very close to an economic and moral breakdown,"" he said. ""Today, there is an air of hope."" Concerns about violence in Guatemala, which has worsened as Mexican drug cartels have stepped up operations in parts of the country, dominated last year's vote. In a Vox Latina national survey in July, more than two-thirds of Guatemalans said violence was what concerned them most, far outpacing the combined totals for the economy, unemployment, poverty and lack of education. The 61-year-old retired general pledged to bring a ""mano dura"" -- firm hand -- to Guatemala's highest office. In a debate co-hosted by CNN en Español last year, Perez Molina called for ""elite units of the army"" to play a larger role in the nation's battle against gangs and drug cartels. That approach -- and Perez Molina's high rank in the military during Guatemala's decades-long civil war -- worries human rights groups in Guatemala and abroad. Concerns stem from the fact that the Guatemalan military committed multiple atrocities during the civil war, although Perez Molina has never been directly implicated in any of them. Poverty is endemic in Guatemala, and the country has one of the worst crime rates in Latin America. Forty-three percent of children under 5 are chronically malnourished. And the murder rate in 2010 was 42 per 100,000 people -- one of the highest in the world. Last year marked only the fourth time that Guatemala has held presidential elections since peace accords were signed in 1996, officially ending a civil war that devastated the country for 36 years. The conflict left more than 100,000 people dead and a million refugees.","Retired Gen. Otto Perez Molina pledges to take a tough stand on crime .

"Beef recalled earlier this year from a California meat producer may have reached 35 states and Guam, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. Thousands of retailers have been added to a list of companies that could have received beef products from the producer, Rancho Feeding Corp., since the February recall, the USDA said. ""The retail list has been growing as more customers have been notified,"" USDA spokesman Adam Tarr told CNN Friday. ""The list could expand."" The USDA will continue to update the list so that the affected products can be removed from commerce, he said. Rancho Feeding Corp., based in Petaluma, California, made headlines in February with its recall of 8.7 million pounds of meat products, which followed a recall of more than 40,000 pounds of meat products in January. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said the meat involved in the February recall came from ""diseased and unsound"" animals that weren't properly inspected. Recall of nearly 9 million pounds of meat not fully inspected . ""Thus, the products are adulterated, because they are unsound, unwholesome or otherwise are unfit for human food and must be removed from commerce,"" the government agency reported in February. The USDA had not received any reports of illness because of the recalled Rancho meat as of a statement issued in February. But the agency called it a ""Class I recall,"" meaning it is a ""health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death.""

"Secretary of State John Kerry took his case on Wednesday to Capitol Hill, urging Congress not to impose new sanctions on Iran as talks with that country on its nuclear program heat up. ""Our hope is that no new sanctions would be put in place for the simple reason that, if they are, it could be viewed as bad faith by the people we are negotiating with,"" Kerry said before entering a closed-door briefing with members of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. ""It could destroy the ability to be able to get agreement,"" he added, ""and it could actually wind up setting us back in dialogue that's taken 30 years to achieve."" There's likely to be push-back to the diplomat's move, as several in Congress who still don't trust Iran's leaders have said they want fresh sanctions to keep up the pressure. Among them is Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, who told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program on Sunday he would not wait for the next round of negotiations. A member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Graham said he intends to propose a measure that would mandate more sanctions, aimed at forcing Iran to dismantle its nuclear program, a move that runs counter to interim steps sought by multinational negotiators earlier this month in Geneva, Switzerland. Those three days of intense discussions involving top diplomats concluded early Sunday without an agreement, though numerous key players indicated things were moving forward. ""A lot of concrete progress has been achieved, but some differences remain,""  European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton told reporters in Geneva. Added  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif: ""I think we are all on the same wavelength, and that's important. And that gives us the impetus to go forward."" The next day, Tehran signed a deal with the International Atomic Energy Agency agreeing to give the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency's inspectors access to long-unseen nuclear sites, including a heavy-water reactor in Arak. Yet more sanctions, not fewer, remain a consideration in Washington. Sanctions have long  been a tool for the United States, in coordination with other nations, to clamp down on Iran and compel it not to move toward developing nuclear weapons. Kerry noted that, when he was a senator representing Massachusetts, he played a part in putting such ""sanctions in place in order to be able to negotiate."" While such measures have managed to hamper Iran's economy and its ability to profit from crude oil exports, they are not the goal, Kerry said. That goal, rather, is to prevent Iran from creating nuclear weapons, something that could continue to happen even if there are no talks and no agreement. The framework for the current deal ""will restrict Iran's ability to grow its program"" and set the stage for ""six months of negotiations on the real tough part of this,"" according to Kerry. If Tehran defies any deal, sanctions can be ramped up again, he said. ""The fact is, we didn't put sanctions in place for the sake of sanctions,"" Kerry said. ""We did it to be able to negotiate."" Sen. Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, won't decide whether he'll go forward with a proposal for more sanctions until after Wednesday's briefing and talks with his colleagues, a committee aide said. While Johnson's views after the meeting broke weren't immediately known, several Republicans on the committee did speak. Sen. Mike Johanns of Nebraska left saying he is ""willing to be patient"" and is somewhat heartened by the fact that as long as ""people are talking, there is hope for progress."" The GOP's ranking member, Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, said he still needs ""to hear more, I'm not ready to make a decision."" Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee described the briefing as ""solely an emotional appeal"" that was ""very unsatisfying."" Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois accused President Barack Obama's administration of appeasing Iran like Britain did Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Kirk pushed for strong sanctions. ""I think today is the day in which I witnessed a future of nuclear war in the Middle East in the future (that) someday will be part of our children's heritage,"" Kirk said. The Banking Committee wasn't Kerry's only stop Wednesday. He -- along with Vice President Joe Biden, chief negotiator Wendy Sherman and David Cohen, under secretary for terrorism and financial Intelligence at the Treasury Department -- also briefed Senate Democratic leaders Wednesday on the Iran nuclear talks. Sherman and Cohen also attended the Banking Committee briefing, but Biden did not. After detailing these two meetings, White House spokesman Jay Carney addressed what the United States should do regarding Iran during Wednesday's press briefing. ""Punishing"" sanctions ""forced Iran to the negotiating table,"" he said. Now that they are there, legislators should be mindful of what they're doing if they are doing things that might undermine those negotiations. ""If not at least testing the hypothesis that Iran is serious about resolving this diplomatically, then what option do we have left?"" Carney asked rhetorically. ""And those who take that position ought to be clear that they, in essence, are suggesting that war is the only alternative.""","1 GOP senator will be ""patient;"" another accuses White House of appeasement .
Carney: If you won't support talks, then you support war as only option .

"The Pentagon will review its policies on hairstyles following backlash from African-American soldiers, who said the Army's revised rules are racially and culturally biased. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has notified Congress that he has directed his deputy to ""work with the service secretaries and the military chiefs to review their respective policies, to address the issues raised by members of Congress about grooming standards, particularly for African-American females,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said this week. Over the next month, the military will take a close look at the ""the definitions of authorized and prohibited hairstyles contained in each of their respective policies and revise any offensive language,"" Kirby said. ""During the next three months, each service will review their hairstyle policies as they pertain to African-American women to ensure standards are fair and respectful of our diverse force, while also meeting our military service's requirements,"" he said. Hagel will tweak Pentagon policies accordingly after the reviews are completed, Kirby added. The latest twist in the hairstyle saga follows an uproar over the Army's new grooming guidelines. Those rules require such things as hair ""must be of uniform dimension, small in diameter (approximately Â¼ inch), show no more than 1/8 (inch) of the scalp between the braids."" Current Army rules ban dreadlocks and twists of any kind as well as styles it views as ""unkempt"" or ""matted."" That type of language rankled African-American soldiers, their supporters and the female members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who said the guidelines force African-American women with ""natural"" hair textures â€” those unaltered by heat or chemicals â€” to either cut or straighten their roots in order to conform to the Army's rules and mainstream cultural standards. One African-American female soldier started an online White House petition, which received more than 13,000 signatures and is no longer on the website. The Army's rules also touched on centuries old cultural identity politics that have been a sensitive issue for the black community since slavery. During that time, and for the generations that followed, straighter hair texture and lighter skin complexion was used to classify which slaves were more valuable and seen as more attractive, African-American scholars noted. Those values, once internalized, damaged self-esteem and were perpetuated within the black community for years, those experts said. The Army had previously rejected criticism of its policies as discriminatory since African-American women helped craft the new regulations. Those guidelines regulate the style of hair parts, braid width and hair thickness. The female members of the Congressional Black Caucus also wrote Hagel earlier this month criticizing the Army's new guidelines as ""discriminatory rules targeting soldiers who are women of color with little regard to what is needed to maintain their natural hair."" Those who objected to the regulations applauded Hagel's intervention. ""Members of the CBC appreciate Secretary Hagel for his prompt response to our letter and for seriously considering our concerns,"" chairwoman Rep. Chair Marcia Fudge, an Ohio Democrat, said in a written statement.  ""The secretary's response affirms his commitment to ensuring all individuals are welcomed and can continue to be proud of serving within our armed forces.""","Pentagon is set to review policies on grooming after complaints of racially discriminatory rules .

"ISIS has Americans worried. Two-thirds of those surveyed in a recent Pew Research poll said they consider the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to be a ""major threat"" to this country. But are such fears really justified? Despite the impression you may have had from listening to U.S. officials in recent weeks, the answer is probably not really. For a start, U.S. officials have been inflating the numbers of Americans fighting for ISIS, which has muddied the issue for the public. U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, for example, told CNN's Jim Sciutto earlier this month, ""We are aware of over 100 U.S. citizens who have U.S. passports who are fighting in the Middle East with ISIL forces."" (ISIS is sometimes referred to as ISIL and now calls itself the Islamic State). But the Pentagon soon corrected Hagel's comment, saying the 100 count is the total number of Americans fighting for any of the various groups fighting in Syria, some of which are more militant than others -- and some of which are even allied with the U.S. Indeed, Matthew Olsen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center -- the government office tasked with assessing terrorist threats -- also confirmed that 100 is the total count of the various Americans fighting in Syria and not a count of those fighting for ISIS. Hagel's comment is only the latest inflated claim regarding the number of Americans fighting with ISIS. Last week, the Washington Times cited anonymous official sources who said there are 300 Americans fighting with ISIS, despite the Pentagon estimating the figure to be more like a dozen. Who is the ISIS? True, a dozen is still too many. But it is important to remember that just because these Americans are fighting with ISIS, it doesn't necessarily translate into a significant threat to the American homeland. One need only look at the example of Somalia to see why. Bergen: When Americans leave for jihad . The last sizeable group of Americans who went overseas to fight with an al Qaeda-aligned group are the 29 Americans known to have traveled to fight with the Somali terrorist group Al-Shabaab after the 2006 invasion of Somalia by the Ethiopian army. However, none of those 29 subsequently planned or conducted a terrorist attack inside the United States, according to a survey of more than 240 jihadist terrorism cases since September 11 conducted by the New America Foundation. What can the U.S. do against ISIS and could it work? Indeed, for more than a third of the American militants who fought with Al-Shabaab, going to Somalia was a one-way ticket. In 2008, a missile strike in Somalia killed Ruben Shumpert, a resident of Seattle. A year later, Burhan Hassan, a 17-year-old from Minneapolis, was killed in the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Abdirizak Bihi, Hassan's uncle, reportedly said at the time, ""We believe he was killed because he would have been a key person in the investigation into the recruitment (of young Somali men) here in Minneapolis."" Al-Shabaab militants also are said to have killed Alabama native Omar Hammami, who joined the group in 2006 and took a high-profile position in its media operations before his death last year. At least two Americans fighting for Al-Shabaab died while conducting suicide attacks in Somalia. Shirwa Ahmed, a 26-year-old from Minnesota, became the first known American to conduct a suicide bombing for an al Qaeda-associated group when he drove a car packed with bombs into a government compound on October 28, 2008. In 2011, meanwhile, the FBI confirmed that Farah Mohamed Beledi, a 27-year-old Minnesota man who was born in Somalia and moved to the United States at age 12, was killed while attempting to detonate a suicide bomb in Somalia. Bergen: An American's gateway to jihad . In addition to the American militants who died in Somalia, six were arrested, four when they returned to the West and two in East Africa. Kamal Said Hassan, a 28-year-old Minneapolis man who traveled to Somalia and attended an Al-Shabaab training camp before returning to the United States, was arrested and in 2009 pleaded guilty to supporting Al-Shabaab. In another case, Mahamud Said Omar, an American resident who helped organize Al-Shabaab's recruitment pipeline and visited a training camp, was arrested in the Netherlands in 2009. Omar was extradited to the United States and in 2012 was convicted on terrorism charges. Of course, the fact that 13 of the 29 American militants who fought in Somalia remain at large is a reminder that the CIA and FBI also need to pay attention to the potential threat posed by American foreign fighters in Syria. But this is no reason for U.S. officials to overhype the threat posed by ISIS to the United States. Yes, Americans should always be mindful of the threats posed by extremists. But as the case of U.S. citizens in Somalia suggests, Syria could very well end up being a graveyard for Americans fighting there rather than a launch pad for attacks on the United States.","Two-thirds of Americans say ISIS ""major threat"" to U.S.
U.S. officials have inflated numbers of Americans fighting for ISIS, says Peter Bergen .
Claims that over 100 U.S. citizens fighting with ISIS are probably overestimate .
Somalia example suggests those fighting in Syria won't pose U.S. threat, Bergen says ."
"(CNN)American adolescents and summer camp go together like bug juice and s'mores. For many young adults, the occasion marks a golden opportunity for co-ed camaraderie in the mess hall or even a stolen kiss in the woods. As the last of the sleepaway campers begrudgingly say their goodbyes to bunkmates this month, it's worth remembering that some campers and counselors keep the campfire flames burning much longer with summer flings that become lifetime commitments. A first -- and last -- kiss . ""I always went to camp kicking and screaming,"" Alex Spitz said of her early teenage years at Camp JCA Shalom in Malibu, California. That is, until a blond boy named Eric showed up to camp one summer. ""And then I never wanted to leave,"" she laughs. For two summers, Alex shared laughs and awkward slow dances with Eric, who ""always had this smile on his face, and his eyes twinkled."" But -- if ""Grease"" taught anything about those summer nights -- as camp ended, so did their teenage romance. Fast-forward to 2006, when Alex signed up for the social networking site MySpace and one blast-from-the-past name popped into her mind: Eric Spitz. They both were in relationships at the time, but exchanged a few friendly messages. A year later, with both of them newly and conveniently single, Eric wrote Alex saying he would be in Los Angeles for his brother's wedding and asked if she would like to meet for a drink. Drinks turned into dinner, which five days later turned into plans to move cross-country -- Eric packed up two months later. In 2008, when the topic of marriage crept up, they knew the only venue that would suit: Camp JCA Shalom. Alex phoned the director, knowing it wasn't a typical wedding venue. The only date the camp had free amid busy summer sessions was May 31, 2009. ""We'll take it,"" she said. They had a date and a venue, but no formal engagement, which came shortly after. ""I look back and am like 'We were crazy!' but it never felt like that,"" she says. The two married, surrounded by 150 friends and family, and shared a slightly less awkward slow dance right where it all started. Eric and Alex, now 34 and 33, live in Orange County with their two sons, who are already attending family weekend at the same camp where their parents met. Eric jokes Alex was his first -- and now last -- kiss. When a wrong room turns out right . As an avid skier during her adolescence, Justine Spence opted to attend a special off-season ski camp, World Mogul Camp, in Whistler, British Columbia. Instead of cabins, campers were put up in hotel rooms at a ski resort for their two-week summer sessions. As campers were getting settled in, Justine wanted to surprise a friend she had met on the competitive ski circuit and asked for her room number at the front desk. ""I ran in the room and yelled 'MEGAN!' -- then quickly realized it was not Megan,"" she says. Instead, she found ""a very cute boy with green eyes and a nice smile,"" who introduced himself as Steele Spence. It was a scene right out of a teen romance novel. ""The second that I met him, it was like a bolt of lightning,"" she says. The pair hung out all through the summer, and continued to rekindle their relationship each summer, even when Steele became a counselor. ""He would get his hand slapped for making out with me, because I was a camper!"" Justine says. Ski camp turned out to be a good investment for a few reasons -- Steele went on to compete worldwide, in the X Games, and has since retired and been instrumental in creating judging criteria for slopestyle skiing, which made its Olympic debut in Sochi, Russia, in February. The couple will have been married four years this month and their relationship shows no signs of going downhill. A perfect rainy day activity . Beigette Gill arrived at Portland International Jetport in Maine from her native Australia in 2002 with nothing but a backpack full of clothes. When a fellow camp counselor named Jim picked her up at the airport, little did she know she had met her life mate. During the off-season, the two began dating. As their second summer working together approached, Jim organized a marriage proposal during a camp assembly with plenty of whitewater-related puns about never knowing what's around the bend. Beigette's answer: ""Yes!"" But, they decided, why wait? So they made plans to get married that summer as well. When Beigette and Jim showed up at town hall to make arrangements, the town clerk asked if she could do the ceremony with people who knew them, to ensure it wasn't just a ploy to get a green card for Beigette. The couple thought of Camp Fernwood's director, not to mention the 300 campers who had witnessed their proposal earlier that summer. Meanwhile, the camp director was trying to come up with a ""rainy day activity"" when the perfect backup plan walked in the door -- Jim and Beigette. The whole camp pitched in on the big day of July 18, 2003. One of the counselors let Beigette borrow a white dress, the senior campers straightened her hair and did her makeup, a camper played Pachelbel's ""Canon in D"" on the piano, the camp's chef made a multi-tiered wedding cake, and the silversmithing department even made rings for the couple. The clerk showed up and performed the ceremony in the camp's main hall. Getting married at camp ensured the ceremony was simple, with little pomp, circumstance and fretting beforehand. ""There was no fighting over the color of the place napkins,"" Jim Gill says. The couple has since purchased a camp nearby, Fernwood Cove, where they live year-round with their son, Perrin, 4½, and daughter Sylvie, 6½. The Gills have experienced adversity as well, with Beigette suffering a traumatic spinal cord injury during a family bike trip after camp season in 2011. Support and encouragement from family members and Fernwood Cove campers have helped Beigette along her road to recovery. And to think it all started when an American camp counselor gave his Aussie colleague a ride from the airport. ""You never know where camp will lead you,"" Jim says.","Camp romances are a classic pop culture trope, and they can be very real .
Couples who meet at camp sometimes choose to go back to get married or engaged there .
""You never know where camp will lead you,"" says one camp owner ."
"(CNN)One military wife recalls staying up all night and deleting every Facebook picture of her children, every post that mentioned them or where they went to school. She Googled herself, trying to figure out how easy it would be to find where the family lived. In the morning, she went to her car and scraped the military decal off the front window. As the spouse of a Special Forces soldier, she's always tried to be conscious of how much she advertises that she and her three young children are a military family. ""It's hard because I am so proud of what my husband does, but lately so many spouses that I know are actually scared that they could be targets of ISIS or someone who sympathizes with ISIS,"" she said, asking that CNN keep her name out of the story for that reason. This week brought the latest in a string of attacks that members of military families say has spooked them into quietly changing the way they operate online and in real life. The U.S. military's Central Command Twitter account was hacked. In all caps, this message: ""AMERICAN SOLDIERS, WE ARE COMING. WATCH YOUR BACK. ISIS."" The tweet included a link to a statement that said, in part, ""We won't stop! We know everything about you, your wives and children. U.S. soldiers! We're watching you!"" The hacker managed to post other threatening messages, propaganda videos and some military documents until the accounts were disabled. Central Command quickly assured that it was relatively easy to hack Twitter, no serious security details were revealed and it would find who was behind the hack. Army wife Ashley Broadway-Mack said the messages just amplified the anxiety she already feels after recent terror attacks targeting military personnel, law enforcement officers and civilians. She and other family members told CNN this week that they first began to think about the possibility in May 2013 when a uniformed British soldier in London was murdered by two men who shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" or ""God is great."" Others started to fear the possibility of their service members or themselves being targeted after the killing of a Canadian soldier during an October attack on the country's Parliament. Attacks and plots in Australia have them concerned, too, they said. In September, the Australian prime minister said a plot to kidnap a member of the public, behead the victim and then drape him or her in an ISIS flag had been thwarted. In December, a self-styled Muslim cleric held hostages in a Sydney cafe for 17 hours, a drama that ended with the deaths of two hostages. The gunman, who was known for sending hate mail to military families, was killed. The slayings in Paris, for which al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has taken responsibility, have prompted Broadway-Mack to think about security at North Carolina's Fort Bragg. ""Before the incident in Canada, I honestly didn't think ISIS was a threat to our family or other military families,"" she said. ""I worry about the hundreds, thousands of folks going to and from work in uniform. They, too, could be targets. I think of other areas around the country where there's a large military presence -- an attack, ambush, lone terrorist is something I fear. ""I hate to say it, but I honestly no longer think if, but when and where,"" she said. ""I think it's only a matter of time."" In late November, the FBI issued a warning to U.S. military members that ISIS was calling for attacks against them, a law enforcement source told CNN. The source said that ""overseas based individuals are looking for like-minded individuals in the U.S. to carry out these attacks."" The warning asked members of the military to ""review their online social media presence for any information that might attract the attention of violent extremists."" The bulletin also said authorities were concerned that ISIS members were ""spotting and assessing"" individuals in the United States who may be interested in carrying out attacks inside the country against members of the military, a U.S. counterterror official told CNN. Lori Volkman, who is married to a commanding officer, said she knows military members and spouses who have stopped openly carrying their uniforms to their car after a visit to the dry cleaners. Some have stopped wearing clothing with military insignia and are more careful when they open their wallet to avoid showing military IDs or payment cards. The small, simple changes don't mean military family members are running scared, Volkman said. But it was difficult when her young daughter was watching television this week and saw the news about the Centcom hack and the threat that ISIS was coming for soldiers. ""She turned and looked at me and you could see it registering -- we're soldiers. She had a very worried look,"" Volkman said. ""But kids are comforted by whatever their parents tell them. We can't live our lives in fear and we try to reassure them."" A blogger and communications firm CEO, Volkman wonders how she would even begin to scrub her online presence. Angela McCormick Ricketts says she's thrown her hands up. Her memoir, ""No Man's War"" is a critical success. She's done a lot of press and is omnipresent online. ""I'm probably screwed if ISIS starts targeting yappy military spouses, so it's too late now! There's also a part of me that thinks that's what they want -- to make us always looking over our shoulders. So no. No to all of it,"" she said. It's a matter of principle, she and others said. Why should families bend to fear and stop sharing online when social media has helped many of them get through 14 years of nonstop war? Though the military has at times struggled with how much freedom its members should have on social media, relatives have wholeheartedly embraced it. Military families appear to use social media at higher rates than civilians, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Social media as we now know it wasn't even around when the Afghanistan war began. Facebook launched in 2004, almost exactly a year after the United States invaded Iraq. Now, dozens of military spouses have blogs and Facebook caters to the community. A 2014 survey by military advocacy group Blue Star Families found that 75% of 6,200 respondents considered the use of social media to be very important. Beyond using it to get practical information like, say, what's happening on a base, social platforms opened up a military culture that has historically discouraged displays of emotion. Social media has offered a safe space to reveal trauma and heartache. It's brought more comfort and less isolation. A spouse in Montana who was gripped by depression during a third deployment can find a spouse in New York who was going through the same thing, and they can help each other in a way that no traditional therapy could. Marine Corps. spouse Liz Snell relies on her new non-profit's website Military Spouses of Strength to be a conduit to family members who have suffered from depression and the general wrung-out feeling of enduring years of war. Her husband has been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan five times. ""I see being online as a way to stay honest, to stay healthy, to help,"" she said. ""I don't want that to be hurt because of some threats that are just some dumb hacker. I don't want to let them win that way."" Amy Bushatz agrees. The Army wife writes the SpouseBuzz column for military.com, which has 10 million members. ""Being a military family is a vulnerable experience, period. If you live in a military town, this is the norm,"" she said. ""Is there more cautiousness now? Sure, but that's not a bad thing. (There won't) be a victory for anyone who thinks they can frighten us.""

"Another animal rights group is shopping for drones it will use to watch for animal abuse -- and gun owners are setting their sights in anticipation. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said this week it plans to purchase drones -- small, remote-controlled, camera-carrying aircraft -- to watch for illegal activity among hunters. In a press release, PETA said it would ""monitor those who are out in the woods with death on their minds,"" using spotlights or feed lures, or drinking alcohol while in possession of a firearm. PETA also intends to fly the remote-controlled aircraft over factory farms, fishing spots and ""other venues where animals routinely suffer and die,"" it said. The group doesn't yet have any drones or specific locations where it intends to fly them, and organizers don't know when they'll attempt to put them in the air. The organization wants to watch bear hunters, in particular,  PETA President Ingrid Newkirk told CNN. Bear hunting is legal, but Newkirk said PETA would look for hunters luring bears with food or killing mothers with cubs at their sides. ""The talk is usually about drones being used as killing machines, but PETA drones will be used to save lives,"" Newkirk said in a news release. In the United States, people can fly model aircraft without approval from the Federal Aviation Administration if they keep the drone in line of sight, lower than 400 feet above ground and away from airports and air traffic. Other types of unmanned aircraft systems need FAA approval, according to the agency. Newkirk said PETA plans to follow U.S. requirements while flying drones and will fly them overseas, where there may be fewer restrictions. PETA is active in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Hong Kong and India. As news of PETA's plan spread, gun owners reacted online. The shooting sports website AmmoLand responded by posting a PETA drone practice target for readers to use at the shooting range. ""Sounds to me like this will create a whole new shooting sport,"" the site said. ""PETA Drone Target Shooting."" Readers at the blog Guns.com posted similar comments. Newkirk said she wasn't concerned. ""I'd rather have them shoot something inanimate than an innocent doe,"" she said. ""It's not the bedroom; it's the great outdoors, so let's see what they're up to."" It isn't the first time an animal rights group has considered using drones to track hunters. Showing Animals Respect and Kindness, or SHARK, has launched camera-carrying aircraft hundreds of times to film pigeon shoots, said Steve Hindi, the organization's president. During pigeon shoots, hunters try to shoot birds after they're released from cages or mechanically launched. Hindi posts the footage online and sends links to state and local law enforcement, but hasn't gotten much response. Twice, SHARK's drones have been shot while filming pigeon shoots at Wing Pointe shooting resort in Berks County, Pennsylvania, Hindi said.  In a press release from November, SHARK said the camera feed went out on a drone camera after a single shot from the shooting range. State police investigators said they couldn't identify who shot the drone at Wing Pointe, and couldn't prove whether it was an accident, said David Beohm, spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Police. Beohm said the drone was flying in airspace restricted by the FAA. Hindi said he doesn't believe the shooting was an accident. ""It was a damn good shot,"" he said. CNN contacted Wing Pointe, but representatives declined to comment. Pigeon shoots are legal in Pennsylvania. Law enforcement officers tried to prevent SHARK from flying a drone in South Carolina in February 2012, Hindi said. A shot brought down the drone soon after it went into the air, and it crashed into a highway, Hindi said. The Colleton County Sheriff's Office filed an incident report. It's still an open case, and no one has been charged. Hindi said he's gotten calls from people who say they'll fly drones over his house. He said he doesn't care, and that he'll continue to fly drones as long as it's legal. ""We have these knee-jerk reactions about drones, when the average person has no worries,"" he said.","PETA says it plans to purchase drones to watch for illegal activity among hunters .

"Let's start with some statistics: Alaska has the highest rate of reported rape in the country at three times the national average. An estimated 59% of adult women there suffer from sexual or intimate partner violence, according to a statewide survey published in 2010.  And 37% suffer from sexual violence. There are many reasons why that's the case, as I detailed in a recent series on rape in Alaska for CNN's Change the List project. But here's a factor I didn't really consider until readers brought it to my attention: Alaska doesn't require sex education. Given the rates of violence, that's puzzling and negligent -- especially since programs that teach kids about healthy relationships, child sex abuse and dating violence have been proved effective in evaluation studies. A bill proposed by Alaska Rep. Geran Tarr, a Democrat from Anchorage, would be a good place to start changing these policies. Called Erin's Law, after an Illinois victim of child sexual abuse, and based on a national movement, the bill would require school districts in Alaska to teach warning signs for child sexual abuse. ""If we really want to change the outlook and the trajectory going ahead 10, 20, 30 years, we really need to be going in and working with the kids,"" Tarr told me in a phone interview. Makes sense, right? The state also should consider broader legislation to include requirements for students to learn about sex, dating violence and safe relationships. Sexual violence in some Alaska communities I visited is so common that it starts to be normalized. If young people grow up in a violent home, where women are valued less than men, then there's little reason to expect them to break the cycle. ""It's so normal to them,"" one student in southwest Alaska told me. ""It could be their mother -- being ashamed (of being abused) -- and it's so normal to you that you just become that. You because the abused or the abuser. It can go back and forth."" Teachers and schools can and should intervene. Some school districts in Alaska are doing a commendable job of bringing up these uncomfortable issues and preparing students to end the violence, but none of the programs is required. Alaska is part of a relatively small minority of states that does not require school districts to teach a form of sex or health education, said Megan Comlossy, a policy expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures. State statutes say ""each district in the state public school system shall be encouraged (emphasis mine) to initiate and conduct a program in health education for kindergarten through grade 12 ..."" Encouraged but not required. School districts decide individually if and how they want to teach these sensitive subjects. Many don't. One effective program, called ""The Fourth R"" for ""relationships,"" encourages students to participate in role-playing exercises and other forms of learning. The program, which was developed in Canada and includes about 20 lessons, has been shown to lead to ""reductions in dating violence"" and ""significantly fewer violent acts towards peers,"" said Patricia Owen, an education specialist at the Alaska Department of Education & Early Development. But only 22.2% of schools in Alaska are using the voluntary program, said Lauree Morton, director of the Alaska Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. That's up from 9.7% in 2011, but it's still not enough. A federal grant helps pay for the program, Owen said. The Anchorage school district teaches sex education and healthy relationships, and some school districts, such as one in Kenai, have developed curriculum in collaboration with local women's rights advocates, according to Morton. There are also encouraging programs such as Teens Acting Against Violence in Bethel. It's an afterschool program to help young people connect with traditional culture and learn how to lead healthy and violence-free lives. I met some students in that program on my trip to the state in December, and they raved about its impact. Most kids in that town aren't in the TAAV program, though. It's Morton's view that Alaska's school districts should choose to teach these programs -- because they will be implemented more powerfully and wholeheartedly if they do. She wants to see this info taught, but she wants it to be voluntary. Maybe there's something about Alaska's pioneer spirit that compels this opt-in approach. But it's clear rates of violence remain unacceptably high under the voluntary system. Perhaps change should come in the form of a mandate that all school districts in Alaska teach about sex abuse and healthy relationships. Tarr's bill would be a good start. Or maybe there are other incentive structures to convince more schools that health and sex education aren't just optional, they're essential. I asked some students who participate in the TAAV program in Bethel what they thought should be done to curb the state's high rates of violence against women. The answer was obvious to them. ""People need to know about it,"" one person said. And another: ""Realize it's there."" I hope the legislature will uncover its ears.","Alaska does not require school districts to teach sex ed .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- At least 18 people -- 13 in India and five in Nepal -- died when a magnitude-6.9 earthquake struck the northern Indian state of Sikkim near the border between the two nations Sunday night, local government officials told sister network CNN-IBN. The dead include three in Nepal's capital of Kathmandu, who died when a wall of the British embassy collapsed, according to Kedar Rijal, Kathmandu police chief. They included an 8-year-old girl, her father and a third person. The British Foreign Office confirmed a ""compound perimeter wall"" of the embassy collapsed, adding that its ambassador has met with the community and offered condolences. Police said in a statement that two more people died in the Nepalese town of Dhara, about 217 miles east of Kathmandu. About a dozen people were injured when they jumped from their houses during the quake, police said. On Monday morning, Sikkim's chief secretary Karma Gyatso said that seven people had died in that province, 65 suffered trauma and 33 had minor injuries. Officials in other local governments reported additional fatalities in their provinces, significantly increasing the overall death toll from Sunday. The network said the dead include at least two Indian army personnel. At least two buildings in Sikkim had collapsed and others developed cracks, Gyatso said Sunday. The damage was still being assessed as first-responders and others worked to find and help survivors, he said. A day later, the Sikkim provincial official said that conditions had taken a positive turn. Communications to stricken areas are ""much better"" now,"" said Gyatso, adding cell phone connections have also improved. He added that rescuers have reached most of the hardest-hit areas, with more emergency crews set to be deployed over the course of the day Monday. Already, 300 civilians had been rescued in one such effort near Sikkim's border with China, said Indo-Tibetan Border Police spokesman Deepak Kumar Pandey. Some 22 tourists -- all of them Indians -- were also rescued in the same area. The deaths, damage and recovery efforts came after a total of three quakes struck the region in rapid succession in a mountainous region. The U.S. Geological Survey initially put the largest quake at 6.8 magnitude, later upgrading it to a 6.9, and the other two at magnitudes 4.8 and 4.6. All three occurred within an hour and 15 minutes, the U.S. agency said. The India Meteorological Department said the quakes were 6.8 magnitude, 5.7 magnitude and 5.3 magnitude. The quakes set off landslides, which -- along with heavy rains -- were blocking roads and hampering rescue efforts, Pandey said. He expressed fears that the toll, as far as deaths and damage, could be more than is now known, anticipating more will be known once the sun rises Monday. Already, authorities have reported power outages and downed phone lines in Sikkim. Emergency crews were dispatched from different locations to the region, India's home ministry said in an alert to reporters. At least four fighter jets were carrying rescue officers to a neighboring region, where they travel by road to Gangtok, Sikkim's capital, according to the alert. As for outside help, World Vision announced Sunday that it ""has put its emergency response team in India on standby"" to provide relief as requested. The nonprofit organization reported that the quake cut off phone communication and electricity in parts of Sikkim and West Bengal provinces. ""The whole earth was shaking and it lasted for two minutes,"" Paul Mathai from World Vision, who was 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the epicenter, said in a statement from the organization. ""We were panicked, but all of us are safe."" No tsunami warning was issued. The strongest earthquake, which struck at 6:10 p.m. local time (8:40 a.m. ET), was 12.2 miles below the earth's surface, according to the USGS. That quake's epicenter was about 42 miles from the city of Gangtok and 169 miles east of Kathmandu, according to the geological survey. CNN's Harmeet Singh, Manesh Shrestha and Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","NEW: 7 dead, 98 are injured in India's Sikkim province, but an official notes improvements .

"A spokesman for Sen. Harry Reid dismissed as ""meritless"" an ethics complaint filed Wednesday by Republicans that charges the majority leader improperly used his government-funded website and Twitter account for partisan political purposes. At issue are Reid's ongoing attacks against Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who are spending millions through their organization Americans for Prosperity to defeat Democratic candidates this campaign cycle. Some of Reid's comments, which he has made in speeches on the Senate floor and elsewhere, also appeared on his senate.gov website and on his official Twitter account. ""Senate rules are clear: Senators and their staffs are prohibited from using official resources for partisan, electoral activities,"" said the complaint filed by Roger Villere, the chairman of the Republican Party of Louisiana. ""Senate staff receive publicly funded salaries for the performance of official duties and no campaign or electoral activities should take place on Senate time, or using official Senate equipment or facilities."" ""Republicans' blind obedience to the shadowy billionaire Koch brothers is on full display today,"" Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said in a statement. ""Nothing says 'Republicans are the party of the top one percent' like lashing out with meritless complaints as a screen to defend the Koch brothers as they rig the system to benefit billionaires like themselves. Sen. Reid will continue to do everything in his power to hold the Koch brothers and their Republican enablers accountable for trying to tilt the playing field in favor of the wealthy and against the middle class."" Congressional ethics experts contacted by CNN were divided over whether Reid's actions violated ethics rules. ""Some of this material could be viewed as technically running afoul of the rule,"" said George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley. ""The problem is that the rule covers legislative matters that are inherently political.  Most things posted or tweeted by members are done so with some partisan or political purpose. Moreover, criticism the Koch brothers is akin to criticisms of other public figures or organizations that are the focus of public officials from those producing violent video games to corporate welfare complaints.""","Republicans say Harry Reid improperly used his government-funded website .

"As mystery surrounds the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH 370, which was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing early Saturday, CNN's aviation expert Richard Quest said the airliner would have been at the safest point in the flight. ""It was two hours into the flight -- this would have been classed as the 'cruise portion of the flight,'"" he said. ""You break down the flight into taxi, take-off, climb out and then cruise. ""So in that particular point of the flight, this is the safest part, nothing is supposed to go wrong. The aircraft is at altitude on auto-pilot, the pilots are making minor corrections and changes for height as the plane burns off fuel -- the plane will be going higher and higher -- so this is extremely serious that something happened at this point in the flight."" READ MORE: Still no contact, stolen passports mystery . Quest, who coincidentally had been working on a story with the carrier recently, said the aircraft -- a Boeing 777-200 -- would have been around 11 years old, powered by two British-made Rolls-Royce Trent engines. ""So it's not a particularly old aircraft. Malaysia has 15 777-200s in its fleet, it's an extremely experienced operator of this type of aircraft. It's a very reputable airline with a very good safety record."" READ MORE: First officer's 'textbook-perfect' flying . It takes three or four minutes for an airliner to fall out of the sky when it is at cruising altitude, Quest said. He added, ""we don't know and won't know for some time whether the plane broke up in the air or entered the water in one piece."" Once that is discovered, investigators can analyze if a crash was due to mechanical or structural failure, a fire, or terrorism, he noted. Back-up power . Greg Feith, a former investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the United States, suggested the pilots should have been able to report in, even if power on the aircraft had failed. ""The airplane by certification has to have battery back-up power -- they still have to be able to utilize certain flight instruments and communication tools to complete the flight safely. ""So you could lose all the generators, you could have both engines out, but the battery back-up -- which will only work for a certain time -- is intended for emergency situations."" Feith also pointed to the possibility of an issue with the pressurization of the aircraft. ""If you have a high-altitude pressurization problem, catastrophic decompression, the time of useful consciousness (the time a pilot can operate with an insufficient oxygen supply) in the 30,000-40,000-feet range is a matter of seconds."" READ MORE: How does a jet disappear? Asked whether it was likely the airliner could have made an emergency landing, Quest said it was possible but unlikely. ""You're not talking about a Cessna here. You're talking about a long-haul, wide-bodied aircraft and that puts it into a completely different league."" Search for aircraft . But with speculation mounting over whether Flight MH 370, which was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, went down on land -- perhaps in Vietnam -- or in the South China Sea, one aviation expert says it's essential to find the plane as soon as possible in case there are survivors. ""Given the modern communications and the truly modern equipped (Boeing) 777, it's highly unlikely this plane would have landed somewhere not contactable,"" Mary Schiavo, the former Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation, told CNN. ""Depending on how the plane has gone down, there could be many survivors in need of aid. ""That plane has many different ways to locate it: Automatic beacons that tell you where it is; there are several ways to contact it both with radios and GPS, as well as computer communications within the cockpit. ""But the lack of communication suggests that something most unfortunate has happened -- though that does not suggest there are not any persons that need to be rescued and secured."" Schiavo warned that if for some reason the transmitters on the airliner are not operating, then the search will obviously become far more complex and time-consuming. ""If they are not working then sadly there are similarities with the Air France plane, which was traveling from Brazil to Paris, France and was lost in the ocean. That was very difficult to locate because of the depth of the ocean,"" she said. Air France Flight 447 -- an Airbus A330-203 -- plunged into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009, killing all 228 people on board. It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of the wreckage and the majority of the bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean. The incident report detailed how the pilots failed to respond effectively to problems with the plane's speed sensors or to correct its trajectory when things first started to go wrong. Aviation expert Jim Tilmon said the Boeing 777-200 was as sophisticated an aircraft as they come with an excellent safety record. ""The only fatality has been from the Asiana crash in San Francisco (last year),"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""There's been one other 777 that had some problems but no-one was hurt. This is really a shock in lots of ways.""","Quest: Airliner would have been classed as in the ""cruise portion of the flight""

"A man who owns an upstate New York food store funded ISIS, tried to send jihadists to Syria to fight with the terrorist group and plotted to do some killing himself -- by gunning down U.S. troops who had served in Iraq -- federal authorities alleged Tuesday. Mufid A. Elfgeeh, 30, was arrested on May 31, though federal officials didn't outline the case against him until Tuesday. According to an indictment, he faces three counts of trying ""to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization"" (namely, ISIS), one count of attempting to kill officers and employees of the United States, two counts of having an unregistered firearm silencer and one for possessing guns or silencers ""in furtherance of a crime of violence."" The public defender representing Elfgeeh, Mark Hosken, said Tuesday that he had seen the indictment and will enter a plea of not guilty when his client appears in court on Thursday morning. The federal investigation into Elfgeeh began in early 2013 and a world away from the Middle East, where ISIS (also known as ISIL and the Islamic State) has waged a brutal campaign in recent years. Citing the terror group's threat to the region and gruesome tactics -- such as the recent beheadings of two American journalists -- the U.S. government has struck ISIS targets from the air in Iraq and threatened to go after it in Syria as well. A look at Twitter suggests that Elfgeeh didn't stand with his adopted country in this fight, according to an affidavit in support of a search warrant in his case. He allegedly wrote in one tweet: ""Al Qaeda said it loud and clear: we are fighting the American invasion and their hegemony over the earth and the people."" In another message, Elfgeeh purportedly stated ISIS ""will one day rule the world with the will of Allah."" The affidavit alleges that he urged people to donate a third of their salary or, at least, ""#Five_thousand_dollars_from_every_household"" (as stated in one tweet) -- stressing the importance of supporting groups like ISIS financially. But the Yemeni-born owner and operator of Halal Mojo and Food Mart, dubbed Mojoe's by some, in Rochester may have wanted to be more than just a financial supporter. Court documents state that -- if he couldn't sell his store -- Elfgeeh wanted to export ""those who are fed up (and want) to go to war and be jihadists."" The FBI informants were among those Elfgeeh actively recruited to join ISIS as jihadists, the affidavit states. He helped them by doing things like paying one of their passport costs, coordinating travel arrangements and setting them up with contacts in the terror group under the guise of going ""to the university,"" which was code for joining ISIS. Court documents, citing Western Union records, allege that Elfgeeh also sent $600 to a Yemeni man that he believed wanted to join the terrorist group. He may have had plans of his own in the United States. The affidavit points to conversations with the two FBI informants in which Elfgeeh talked about getting his hands on guns and ammunition to inflict violence stateside. According to the affidavit, Elfgeeh once said he might kill ""five or ten already, 15, something like that ... then we"" will post video or another message online to explain why he did it . ""We want ... to start shooting those who were in the Army who went to Iraq,"" he said in April, according to the document. Authorities say they arrested Elfgeeh after he paid for and received two handguns, silencers and ammunition from one of the informants. Elfgeeh is now in federal custody. If convicted, he could be there for far longer: The firearms possession charges alone have maximum 30 year sentences, the attempted murder charge maximum sentence is 20 years, and a count for providing material support to a terrorist group is up to 15 years. Attorney General Eric Holder said the case shows federal authorities use of ""all the investigative tools at our disposal"" -- from searches of social media platforms to FBI informants -- ""to break up these plots before individuals can put their plans into action."" ""We will remain aggressive in identifying and disrupting those who seek to provide support to ISIL and other terrorist groups that are bent on inflicting harm upon Americans,"" Holder said. ""... We are focused on breaking up these activities on the front end, before supporters of ISIL can make good on plans to travel to the region or recruit sympathizers to this cause.""

"(CNN)The latest Charlie Hebdo cartoon, produced after last week's horrific attacks on the Paris magazine's offices, literally adds insult to injury.  Admittedly a portrait in mixed messages, the cover reads ""All is forgiven"" above a drawing of the Prophet Mohammed, who is holding a ""Je suis Charlie"" sign.  Who, exactly, is supposed to be doing the forgiving and who must be forgiven is not clear. Zineb El Rhazoui, a writer with Charlie Hebdo, said the cover means the magazine's journalists were forgiving the extremists for the killings.  But the cover could also be interpreted as Mohammed saying he forgives the cartoonists in a way the terrorists, obviously, did not. But the cartoons are somewhat irrelevant. As Middle East analyst Juan Cole has argued, they were just an excuse for Islamic zealots to further widen and exploit the perceived gulf between Islam and ""the West.""  Cole writes, ""Al Qaeda wants to mentally colonize French Muslims, but faces a wall of disinterest. But if it can get non-Muslim French to be beastly to ethnic Muslims on the grounds that they are Muslims, it can start creating a common political identity around grievance against discrimination.""  Enter the cartoons. This is why it is baffling that political voices around the world, especially conservatives, have argued that we must show our support for Charlie Hebdo and free speech by reprinting the magazine's offensive cartoons. Remember, this is a publication few outside France had heard of before it was targeted and even fewer had read -- and arguably one that many would have taken offense at in a different context. In fact, in a line of thinking best articulated by New York Times columnist and CNN contributor Ross Douthat, the violent reaction to Charlie Hebdo's offensive cartoons not only justifies but also somehow demands that we not only continue but also ramp up that offense as a form of protest.  ""If a large enough group of someones is willing to kill you for saying something, then it's something that almost certainly needs to be said,"" wrote Douthat.  In other words, the violent reaction to something offensive not only retroactively justifies the offense in the first place but valorizes its rationale going forward? Some have indeed argued that because some radical Islamists resort to violence it justifies not only broad offenses and smears of the entire religion but also thinking of such smears against Islam as different from those directed at Judaism or Christianity.  This ignores, for example, mass murderer Anders Breivik, who left a 1,500 page manifesto proclaiming himself ""100% a Christian"" and advancing his vision of a ""monocultural Christian Europe."" In 2011, Breivik killed 77 people in Norway.  Does that attack justify blasphemy against Christianity and make it incumbent on all of us to increase such blasphemy as a form of protest?  The likely response -- that violence inspired by Christianity or Judaism is somehow an exception while violence inspired by Islam is a rule --i s merely a way of justifying in hindsight and in perpetuity smears against a group one has already decided to hate. As Adam Shatz at the London Review of Books has noted, right-wing fascists in France and Europe more broadly share an organizing principle with jihadists: ""that there is an apocalyptic war between Europe and Islam.""  Blanket incriminations of the whole of Islam based on the acts of zealots help feed the premise.  So do cartoons that blaspheme the Prophet Mohammed. Though it's perverse to demand all Muslims apologize or account for the acts of radicals within their faith, since the Paris attacks such demands have been made and plenty of moderate Muslims have spoken out.  And yet perhaps part of the reason we don't hear enough from these voices is that they simply don't fit the narrative fueled by the zealots in Islam and ""the West"" and happily covered by the apocalypse-loving media. This would also explain why the media and ""the West"" are still fixated on the slaying of 17 people in France and paying infinitely less attention to as many as 2,000 people killed in Nigeria by Boko Haram.  It falls outside the ""us versus them"" frame — and is further evidence that, as protesters in the United States have been asserting, black lives simply aren't treated as though they matter. I unequivocally and unconditionally support the right to free speech.  Unfettered free speech is essential to any democratic and pluralistic society.  So I support the right of Charlie Hebdo to print the most outlandish, offensive cartoons it can come up with.  And, to give another example, I support the free speech rights of French comedian Dieudonné M'bala M'bala — even though I personally find his anti-Semitic jokes even more offensive and sick than any of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons I've seen. Still, I don't think M'bala M'bala should be facing prosecution by the French government for his speech, as he has apparently 38 times.  Curiously, I don't see those rallying supposedly in support of free speech protesting M'bala M'bala's repeated prosecution.  At the same time, many of those supposedly proclaiming support for free speech are shaming and smearing media outlets that choose not to reprint the Charlie Hebdo drawings. The fascist right-wing and fundamentalist Islamists want the same thing: to convince Muslims and ""the West"" that there is an inherent divide between the two. The question for the rest of us — the ones who have free speech — is whether we feed the apocalyptic narrative or fight it. A few fanatical Islamists have horrifically and unimaginably offended the world. That's no excuse for anyone to go on offending all Muslims.  To do so only helps advance the terrorists' goal.","Sally Kohn: When violence used to silence free speech, some argue to ramp up cartoons .
She says media doesn't urge this over Christian violence, thus feeding jihadist view: Islam vs. West .
Kohn: Those of us with free speech shouldn't use it to help justify Islamists' apocalyptic narrative ."
"(CNN)In the months after the ship sinking, Titanic survivor Lady Lucy Duff-Gordon's correspondence to her friend in New York starts, as one might expect, with an appropriate amount of thanks for her concern. ""How kind of you to send me a cable of sympathy from New York on our safety,"" Duff-Gordon writes in a letter that will go up for auction Wednesday in Boston. The remarks she writes next on her own personal letterhead dated May 27, 1912, indicate that not all were pleased with how things turned out. ""According to the way we've been treated by England on our return we didn't seem to have done the right thing in being saved at all!!!! Isn't it disgraceful?"" Duff-Gordon said. Duff-Gordon and her husband, Cosmo, escaped the Titanic's tragic end by boarding Lifeboat 1, which transported 12 passengers despite having capacity for 40. The prominent fashion designer and her husband were the only two passengers asked to testify during the British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the famous ship's sinking.  Their testimony made them popular fodder for tabloids after allegations that Cosmo had bribed the crew to row away faster, rather than trying to rescue others. Lifeboat 1 became known as the ""Money Boat."" Rumors that the Duff-Gordons tried to deter the crew from making other rescues were never corroborated, but Lucy Duff-Gordon later said  her husband was ""brokenhearted over the negative coverage for the rest of his life,"" according to a release from RR Auction, the house responsible for the sale of the letter. Other artifacts also up for auction with Duff-Gordon's letter include a teacup from the Titanic that was, according to the auction house, ""destined for the bottom of the Atlantic,"" a guitar belonging to Johnny Ramone of the Ramones, and a three-page letter by Civil Rights activist Malcolm X written from a Norfolk prison in 1950. In his letter, Malcolm X proclaims his allegiance to ""the Almighty God, Allah,"" whom he credits with ""cleaning our polluted souls."" Before converting to Islam in 1948, Malcolm X lived in Boston, where he befriended musicians at the Roseland State Ballroom where he worked.  Though he renounced his former life, saying, ""Without Allah, no wonder we have so longingly turned so often to music for its comforting effects,"" he wrote longingly of his former friends.

"Lawmakers began a new session of Congress with the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, still fresh in their minds -- inspiring a new push to pass gun laws that could prevent another tragedy. On Day One, lawmakers in the House of Representatives introduced nearly a dozen bills related to gun violence. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, a longtime gun control advocate, led the fight on the Democratic side of the aisle. She's sponsoring legislation that would require background checks for all gun sales -- including at gun shows -- and ban online sales of ammunition. McCarthy is also co-sponsoring a bill to ban high-capacity magazines with Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colorado. DeGette's district includes Columbine High School, where two gunmen killed 13 people in 1999, and is next to Aurora, where a gunman killed 12 people in a mass shooting at a movie theater in July. ""These assault magazines help put the 'mass' in 'mass shooting' and anything we can do to stop their proliferation will save lives in America,"" said McCarthy, whose husband was killed and her son critically wounded in a mass shooting on the Long Island Railroad in New York in 1993. ""These devices are used to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time possible, and we owe it to innocent Americans everywhere to keep them out of the hands of dangerous people."" Meanwhile, two Republican freshmen, Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas and Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, have introduced bills that would allow more guns around schools. In the Senate, California Democrat Dianne Feinstein plans to introduce a bill to ban the sale, transfer, importation and manufacturing of more than 100 firearms. The bill would also ban certain semiautomatic rifles, handguns and shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine, and semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds. The assault weapons ban Feinstein helped pass in 1994 expired in 2004. Feinstein is in the process of gathering support for her bill in both chambers. Marine to Feinstein: 'No ma'am,' I won't register my guns . Bills sponsored by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, to ban high-capacity magazines and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, to enhance background checks and close the gun show loophole already have counterparts in the lower chamber. But gun control is a heated topic, and any push to restrict access to guns will be met with strong opposition from the 4-million-member National Rifle Association, the nation's most powerful gun rights lobby. The NRA has long blocked efforts to introduce tougher gun laws, arguing Congress cannot infringe on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. In a press conference a week after the Newtown shootings, the group's Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre asked, ""Since when did the word 'gun' automatically become a bad word?"" He called on Congress to appropriate enough money to put armed police officers in every school in the country. The NRA has also questioned the effectiveness of gun bans, suggesting they could put communities in danger. ""Politicians pass laws for Gun-Free School Zones,"" LaPierre said during the December press conference. ""They issue press releases bragging about them. They post signs advertising them. And in so doing, they tell every insane killer in America that schools are their safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk."" Gun owners fear new legislation could tread on their rights . No gun-control efforts will bear fruit without support from both sides of the aisle, which is by no means a sure thing. So far, no Republicans have come forward to sponsor new legislation restricting gun rights, and several Democrats also speak out in favor of gun rights. ""The NRA is the big issue, but I wouldn't say it's on the Republican side only, it's on the Democratic side also. ... fully half of your new Senate has either an A+, A or A- rating from the NRA,"" said John Gramlich, who covers gun control for CQ Roll Call. ""The NRA has said that the answer to Newtown is to put more guns, more police officers in schools, and so if you want anything to happen on gun control, you're going to have at least half of the Senate upsetting the NRA and that's a very difficult proposition."" Gramlich said some elements of gun control -- like banning high-capacity ammunition magazines -- could get passed, but more comprehensive legislation faces long odds. Gun-control supporters believe having the support of the highest office in the land could help make a difference this time around. President Barack Obama called for action at a vigil in Newtown after the shooting. ""Since I've been president, this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieving community torn apart by mass shootings, fourth time we've hugged survivors, the fourth time we've consoled the families of victims,"" he said. ""Are we really prepared to say that we're powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard?"" Days later, he announced Vice President Joe Biden would lead a task force to come up with recommendations on ways to reduce gun violence, which is expected to include new gun regulations. Those recommendations are due this month, and the president has said he wants Congress to pass legislation this year. iReport: Why would someone own a military-style rifle? While the politics will be difficult, pro-gun control members believe the 113th Congress could make progress on guns. ""We're hopeful that more can get done on this issue now than in many years,"" said Shams Tarek, McCarthy's communications director. ""The climate seems different now, after Newtown, than after other recent mass shootings."" They also acknowledge a tough and potentially long road ahead.

It's also a fight that will have to compete with several other legislative priorities, including the debate over raising the country's borrowing limit, and a deficit-cutting agreement that will avoid steep automatic spending cuts that are set to kick in about two months from now if lawmakers can't make a deal. ""There's definitely a question of timing and floor time for these kinds of debates, and then there's also the political question,"" said Gramlich. ""You just had a fiscal cliff deal where the House speaker really alienated a lot of the members of his own party, because he was seen as making too many concessions towards the Democrats, and if you're talking about an issue as powerful and emotional as gun control, is the speaker really going to meet Democrats halfway on something like that and risk offending his own party even more?

"In the automotive world, good things often come in fours. Four doors, four-wheel drive and, in one corner of Germany, four of the planet's finest motoring museums. And you don't even need a car to visit them. Germany's premium motoring brands can be seen the world over, but only in Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg, where their manufacturers -- Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche -- have established the museums in their honor can their legacy be fully appreciated. Between them, the collections based in a magic motoring triangle that connects the cities of Stuttgart, Munich and Ingolstadt, are a priceless showcase of automotive history. The hundreds of cars, trucks and motorbikes on display range from the pioneering creations of Gottlieb Daimler, Carl Benz and August Horch through to the futuristic prewar designs of Ferdinand Porsche and on to the high-tech vehicles of the modern era. For car enthusiasts -- or simply anyone interested in the technology of modern transport, global brand values and remarkable architecture -- these state-of-the-art museums create a touring ""golden triangle"" that can be covered in a couple of days using Stuttgart or Munich as a base. Innovation, engineering excellence, historic achievement and a sense of style are some of the factors that exemplify the vehicles on display. Ethereal aluminum body . An example is the first exhibit a visitor encounters at the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart: the ethereal aluminum body shape of the 1939 Type 64. Clearly the forerunner of all Porsches, this tiny streamlined prototype was designed as a long-distance racing coupe by company founder Ferdinand Porsche. After World War II, it was the first car to carry the family name, ahead of the Porsche 356 No. 1. Not far from the Type 64 is a car that began Porsche's long association with the Le Mans 24-hour race in France. In 1951, a 1.1 liter Porsche 356 SL coupe bearing the number 46 competed in the race, winning its class and finishing 20th overall. Between 1970 and 1987, Porsche was the outright winner 12 times at Le Mans, and added another four wins in the 1990s. The massive collection at the Mercedes-Benz Museum, also in Stuttgart, includes such historical masterpieces as the Benz Patent-Motorwagen of 1885, the first Daimler motor car of 1892, the supercharged Mercedes-Benz roadsters of the 1920s and 1930s, through to the quirky high-speed transporter built to carry the 300 SLR sports racer to the track. On one wall of the museum stands the 1939 six-wheeled T80 world record car, originally fitted with a 44-liter V12 engine that was designed to reach a speed of 600 kilometers per hour (372 mph). Plans for a record attempt were undone by the advent of World War II; the car was mothballed and its engine removed. Mercedes' racing heritage is prominent, culminating in a spectacular lineup of its Silver Arrow grand prix and sports racing cars. Outside the museum, a bronze statue depicts five-time world champion F1 driver Juan Manuel Fangio standing next to his 1954 W196 grand prix racer. Audi, created by engineer August Horch in 1910, consolidated its brand in 1932 when it joined with Wanderer and DKW to form Auto Union under the ""four rings"" emblem. Flowing silver masterpiece . Examples of all these marques can be found at the Audi Museum, along with Audi's Le Mans-winning sports racers, the Quattro rally championship cars and the ""baby Thunderbird"" Auto Union 1000 SP. One highlight of the Audi display is a flowing silver masterpiece known as the 1937 Auto Union V16 Type C Streamliner racing car. The car on show is a modern recreation of the Streamliner that German driver Bernd Rosemeyer took to a speed of more than 400 kmh on the Frankfurt-Darmstadt autobahn in October 1937, the first time the mark was reached on a normal road. Rosemeyer was killed in 1938 during a similar speed attempt on the same road. In Munich, most people arrive by subway to BMW Welt, which is a showroom and delivery center for its contemporary BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands. A pedestrian bridge links this with the silver bowl-shaped BMW Museum across the road. The museum pays homage to the company's aero engine origins and to its F1 racing endeavors with Brabham, Williams and Sauber, but primarily features a superb range of prewar and postwar BMW saloons, roadsters and coupes, along with its current crop of high-technology vehicles such as the i8 concept car. Highlights include a roadster and coupe versions of the classic 1939 328 model, while curiosities such as the 1955 Isetta bubble car enliven the display. Between them, the four museums can easily soak up four days of visitor time, particularly if the factory tours are included. Either Stuttgart or Munich makes a great base. They are two of Germany's most liveable and appealing cities -- easy on the eye, great transportation systems and not too expensive. The business-style hotel chain Motel One, for example, offers rooms close to the main stations for €60 to €80 ($80-$107) outside peak season. If time permits, Germany's other great auto museum, Volkswagen's sprawling Autostadt, lies 600 kilometers north of Munich in the city of Wolfsburg, about an hour by train west of Berlin. Munich to Berlin takes about six hours by car or train. Getting there . InterCity Express (ICE) train services link Munich and Stuttgart in a little over two hours, while Ingolstadt is 40 minutes by train from Munich.

"The state attorney overseeing the probe into the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin is known in Florida as a tough prosecutor ready to pursue what she believes is right, even in the face of media glare and public pressure. No stranger to controversial terrain, Angela Corey spent more than 25 years as an assistant state attorney, trying hundreds of cases. In 2008 she was elected the top prosecutor in the three counties of the 4th Judicial Circuit, in Florida's northeast corner. Since then, Corey, 57, has made waves for the number of cases she brings to trial. She's also rejected heated criticism, particularly over her prosecution of a 12-year-old boy for murder. Corey is trying him as an adult. Corey ""lives up to every prosecutor's mantra to be 'tough on crime,'"" wrote Michael Hallett and Daniel Pontzer, criminology professors at the University of North Florida, in a study published this year. In 2010, Duval County, which Corey oversees, ""had the highest incarceration rate of any jurisdiction over 500,000 in Florida,"" the professors note. From 2008 through 2011, Duval County's average daily jail population rose from 3,725 to 3,990 (an increase of 7.1%), according to the study. Corey's record shows she chooses cases based not only on possibility for success at trial, but also ""wherever charges seem warranted,"" the study says. The depiction of Corey as one of the state's toughest prosecutors is likely welcome news to those who believe George Zimmerman should be charged. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, says he shot Martin in self-defense February 26. Corey has described Martin's family as ""lovely people."" She said she has met with them and prayed with them and promised to get them answers. Florida Gov. Rick Scott appointed Corey to take over after state attorney Norm Wolfinger stepped aside amid complaints over his handling of the case. Wolfinger's 18th Judicial Circuit includes Seminole County, where the shooting took place. Scott announced that he and Attorney General Pam Bondi ""have full faith"" in Corey to handle the case, which is playing out under a microscope amid worldwide media attention. But Corey has detractors as well, who cast her as too aggressive. Three petitions on the website change.org, calling for her to be removed from office, have about 2,500 signatures combined. One complains that she prosecutes too many cases without adequate regard for the facts. A petition calling for 12-year-old Cristian Fernandez to be treated as a juvenile rather than an adult has nearly 185,000 signatures. He is accused of violently killing his 2-year-old brother. Corey has said she has compassion for Cristian, but that ""it's not my job to forgive."" And the two professors state in their report that Corey's propensity for bringing charges ""poses great strain on the system and there has already been conflict between Ms. Corey's office and the sitting judges due to the increased caseload. Even sitting judges agree that it's Ms. Corey's office driving the higher incarceration."" On her 2008 campaign website, Corey vowed to ""continue my excellent working relationship with law enforcement so that together we can vigorously fight crime. Only then can we make our community among the safest in the nation."" It's a commitment she has expressed in interviews with CNN and HLN about the Martin case. ""Every aspect of both the shooter and the victim will be looked at and analyzed as it relates to the evidence in this case,"" Corey vowed to HLN. Discussing Florida's ""stand your ground"" law -- which allows people to use deadly force in situations in which they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury -- Corey said, ""our laws are very clear that it has to be a forcible felony and that a reasonable person would have to believe that deadly force is necessary as opposed to just physical force, fighting back and that sort of thing. I've prosecuted a woman who shot her husband and killed him because he slapped her, and we argued that was not deadly force and she was convicted and sent to state prison."" The ""political outcry"" over the Trayvon Martin case makes prosecutors' work harder, she said. ""We would hope that people would give us a chance to get this task that the governor has given us accomplished,"" she told CNN. ""We will leave no stone unturned in our quest to seek justice for Trayvon and for his parents."" A native of Jacksonville, Florida, Corey is active in the Republican Party and her Episcopal church. She got her legal degree at the University of Florida and began her legal career at a private firm specializing in insurance defense. She joined the state attorney's office in 1981.","Angela Corey lives up to the ""tough on crime"" mantra, two criminologists say .

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN)When you look at the gleaming buildings of Colombo and the fast-paced development that has taken place in recent years, it is perhaps easy to forget that until five years ago, Sri Lanka was embroiled in a bitter civil war. Tens of thousands were killed, and hundreds of thousands displaced, in a three-decade  conflict between the state and separatist insurgents in the north,  known as the Tamil Tigers. Peace is therefore a relatively new concept here, and something Sri Lankans don't take for granted. 'Truth and reconciliation' It's also the primary message from Pope Francis as he arrived in the island nation. On Tuesday, his first day of a three-day tour of the country, he told an audience that Sri Lanka cannot fully heal without ""fostering reconciliation."" He said the ""pursuit of truth"" was important, ""not for the sake of opening old wounds, but rather as a necessary means of promoting justice, healing and unity."" While steps towards reconciliation have been taken since the war ended in 2009, mainly in terms of economic and infrastructure development, real reconciliation on an emotional and spiritual level has yet to happen. ""We had a military victory, five years ago but whether after that there is a victory of the hearts is a question we need to ask ourselves,"" the Archbishop of Sri Lanka, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith told CNN. War-stricken past . Sri Lanka has had a dark history, Cardinal Ranjith said, but now it is time for the country to put that behind and construct a new Sri Lanka, with a new identity where each minority group is respected and accepted. The island nation needs, he said, to ""send a message to the world that Sri Lanka is a nation of peacemakers."" The timing couldn't be more fortuitous. Pope Francis arrives just days after a new government was sworn in after a massive electoral upset. The new government under new President Maitripala Sirasena has promised to make reconciliation a priority. He won the snap elections largely because of the support from minority groups -- including Hindu Tamils -- so reaching a consensus is expected to be easier. Sirasena was a long time ally of outgoing president Mahinda Rajapaksa during the war but defected soon after snap elections were called in November. Multifaith greeting . In a show of ethnic coexistence, the pope's welcoming ceremony featured traditional dancers from both the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil groups. At an inter-religious meeting on Tuesday, perhaps the most important part of Pope Francis' first day in Sri Lanka, the session began with Buddhist chants, Hindu and Muslim blessings and then a message from Pope Francis on religious and ethnic harmony. He will also be traveling to Madhu, a town in the north of Sri Lanka, the former heart of the war zone, where he will meet with a number of families both Tamil and Sinhalese who suffered the consequences of the conflict. Sri Lankans are proud of their pan-religious, multi-ethnic heritage. More than 70% of the 21 million-strong population is Buddhist, 6-7%  Christian and the remainder Hindu and Muslim, but religious tensions in recent years have given some cause for concern. Outbreaks of religious violence . Churches have been burned down and Muslims have been attacked -- the most violent case of which occurred in 2014, when at least three people were killed in a Buddhist-Muslim riot. Monk Galagad Atte Gnanasara's hardline Buddhist group, the Bodu Bala Sena is often blamed for the attacks. Gnanasara told CNN they condemn violence but argued that when Christian evangelicals try to ""disrupt Sri Lanka's culture and society by proselytizing and breaking Buddha statues a rage develops deep inside,"" his group will react. Unity urged . While violent incidents between people of different religious groups like these attract headlines, leaders of a most religious groups in Sri Lanka say they are isolated and politically motivated. ""There are extremists, they are not the majority,"" Cardinal Ranjith says. ""So we cannot say there are religious persecutions in an organized fashion."" Sri Lanka has a porous culture where people from various faiths have intermingled and taken aspects from other religions. ""I am a Catholic, but I am very sure Buddhism, which is followed by the majority in the country, has influenced my thinking,"" he said. It is this co-existence of faiths Cardinal Ranjith wants Pope Francis to witness for himself in Sri Lanka, and thinks it's the best way forward for Christianity in Asia.","Pope Francis visits Sri Lanka for a three-day tour, preaches reconciliation for war-divided nation .

"(CNN) -- An Indiana school district might appeal a summary judgment that said it violated two students' First Amendment rights by punishing them for posting racy photos to social networking sites, the district's lawyer said. The female students, then both rising sophomores, took a series of photos featuring ""phallic-shaped rainbow lollipops"" at several sleepovers during summer 2009. None of the photos were openly accessible to non-friends or those who did not have a photo-sharing password. The pictures got into school officials' hands after a parent printed them and complained to the district's superintendent that they had caused ""divisiveness"" on the plaintiffs' volleyball team. The opinion, which District Judge Philip Simon issued on August 10, said the Smith-Green school district in Churubusco, Indiana, did not have the right to temporarily bar the two students from extracurricular activities, require them to go to counseling and apologize to the district's all-male coaches board. The opinion does not identify the students, as they are both minors. Regardless they are the butt of several jokes throughout Simon's 38-page explanation of his decision. ""Let's be honest about it: the speech in this case doesn't exactly call to mind high-minded civic discourse about current events,"" Simon writes. Churubusco High School's code of conduct says activities in or out of school that could ""dishonor"" the school are punishable, but the opinion questions the policy's constitutionality. Erik Weber, general counsel for Smith-Green schools, said the district does not see the code as being unconstitutional. ""There's a judgment that's been rendered by the court. It's respected because it's rendered by a judge, but it doesn't mean that the school is going to agree with that and settle the litigation at this point,"" Weber said. ""It's an unsettled area of the law, and I don't think this is going to be the final say on how social media and the school environment intertwine."" A decision on a portion of the school's defense is still pending, Weber said. Another Indiana district recently won a case that granted it immunity from paying damages under the 11th Amendment, which grants such immunity to states. That district is defending the decision in an appellate court. Weber said the Smith-Green district will wait on that case's outcome, and consequently the decision for its own case, before deciding whether or not to appeal. The American Civil Liberties Union is representing the students. Ken Falk, legal director of the ACLU's Indiana chapter, said just because schools have access to information about students' behavior outside school does not mean they have the authority to discipline that behavior. ""What schools have to recognize is there is that line and the type of stuff that my friends and I in high school did -- I'm in my late 50s now -- the school never knew about,"" Falk said. ""Now, of course, with social media, the school and school personnel can easily find out. But that doesn't change the calculus."" Simon's opinion disagreed with the district's arguments that the photos should not be considered protected speech. The ruling says they do not count as obscene or child pornography because they contain no nudity and had a high probability of being understood as humorous by their intended teenage audience. Additionally, the court opinion holds the situation up against landmark Supreme Court speech-in-school cases, applying them with the added variable of social media. One of the major issues in the case was whether the girls' pictures qualify as a substantial disruption to school operations, which would then not be protected speech. Simon's opinion said the photo shoots, conducted off school property without portraying any school insignia and not shared with the wider school community, were not such a disruption. ""A student cannot be punished with a ban from extracurricular activities for nondisruptive speech,"" the opinion says. As schools and courts grapple with determining where a school's authority ends online, more First Amendment cases like this one will crop up, said Catherine Ross, a professor at The George Washington University Law School and author of the forthcoming ""The Troubled First Amendment in Our Public Schools."" ""Traditionally, one could talk about a kind of geographical analogy with speech in schools,"" Ross said. ""It was fairly clear what speech took place in school and what speech took place out of school."" New tests are starting to emerge to determine whether online speech takes place ""in"" school, such as determining whether the person who created the speech made it available at school. Without such distinctions, ""the school would become almost a police state that could reach out and discipline students for what they do anywhere,"" Ross said. ""If we are going to delegate decision-making authority to school officials, as we have to, since I don't think we want the courts running the schools, then we have to hold them to a high standard,"" she said. Ross said there are some very clear-cut examples of online behavior that constitute disturbances in school. Cyberbullying, for example, interferes with a student's education. Though Ross said she agreed with Simon's opinion, she said the digs and jokes that pervade the document should not belittle the importance of the students' decision to pursue the case. ""These two girls and their families stood up for First Amendment rights,"" Ross said. ""And while the judge makes a few comments at their expense, the only way we preserve rights is when people are willing to fight for them. So whatever misjudgment these girls showed in their so-called bad behavior, for society this is very productive litigation, because it protects the rights of other students, as well.""","Teenagers posed with ""phallic-shaped rainbow lollipops"" and posted the photos online .

"With just two weeks before the health care exchanges open and the Affordable Care Act really kicks in, the only thing that's clear about the law is that Americans are totally confused about what it does. Two polls released this week paint a dismal picture for those of us who consider it our job to explain what health care reform means to the public. The first, from the Wall Street Journal and NBC News, showed that almost 70% of people don't understand what Obamacare is or that they understand only a part of it. While 31% thought it was a good idea, 44% thought it was a bad one. The remaining 25% weren't sure. It gets worse. When the poll specifically looked at the uninsured -- which Obamacare is specifically designed to help -- more than three-quarters of them said they didn't understand how the law would affect them. Another poll, from the Pew Research Center and USA Today, found that 53% of Americans disapprove of Obamacare, compared with 42% who approve. In this poll, though, only a third said they had little or no understanding of how the law would affect them. Almost half of people thought that health exchanges would not be available in their state. While Obamacare is complicated, our understanding of it doesn't have to be so. This is what Obamacare will do: . Most Americans already get health insurance from their jobs, Medicaid, Medicare or the Department of Veterans Affairs. The vast majority of those people will continue to do so. But starting in 2014, people without health insurance will get insured in one of two ways. If they are very poor -- making less than 133% of the poverty line -- then they will get Medicaid through the expansion of the program. That is, if their state has opted to participate in the program. If their state has not, then they may continue to be uninsured. The rest of the people without health insurance will go to the exchanges to get it. There, they can choose from plans with different levels of co-payments and deductibles, according to how much they want to spend. If they make less than 400% of the poverty line, they will get a tax credit or subsidy to help with the cost. No one can be denied health insurance anymore, and no one can be charged more for being sick. All the plans are from private insurance, and they're going to compete for your business. Complete coverage: Health care in America . There are other bells and whistles, but that's Obamacare in a nutshell. If you ask me, I think Obamacare will do more good than harm. Many uninsured Americans are unable to get insurance in the market as it exists today, especially if they have chronic conditions. Those who can afford to often pay a fortune for it. Obamacare is a solution to these problems. While a relatively small number of people will see their rates go up, they're mostly young, healthy people making more than 400% of the poverty line. The vast majority -- more than 90% of people getting their insurance in the exchanges -- will get subsidies to make their insurance more affordable. Plus, now everyone, even if they're young and healthy at the moment, will be protected if they or a member of their family gets sick or when they grow old. There are places you can go right now to get more information. For instance, you can visit www.healthcare.gov. At that website, by answering a few questions, you can see what options will be available to you starting October 1. After that date, you will be taken to your state's exchange, where you will be able to get actual information about plans and sign up for them. Coverage will start January 1. Originally, Obamacare was expected to come with more than half a billion dollars to be spent on outreach and education efforts about the exchanges. This money was supposed to be used to help people understand how Obamacare was supposed to work for everyone. But the Republican-led House of Representatives cut the whole implementation budget. When Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was further forced to move what little money remained in the PR budget into the Prevention Public Health Fund (which was also cut), Sen. Max Baucus, one of the main architects of Obamacare, got upset. He remarked that the law was complicated and that we would get a ""train wreck."" Many leapt on this comment and proclaimed that even Baucus thought the law was a mess. But that's not what he said. He meant that if people didn't understand how it worked, then it would be a mess. At the moment, his prediction could still come true. The latest polls show that, as he feared, too few people understand how Obamacare functions. But there's still time. It will take a lot of outreach and a lot of elbow grease, but supporters of the law believe they are up to the task. Time will tell. October 1 is approaching fast.","Polls indicate that many Americans are very confused about what Obamacare is .

"December holiday shoppers were not just interested in buying the hottest electronics and  toys -- they also were purchasing record numbers of guns, according to the latest FBI figures on background checks required to buy firearms. With a few days left in December, the FBI reports the number of background checks has already topped the previous one-month record -- set only in November -- of 1,534,414 inquiries by gun dealers to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System also known as NICS. Almost half a million checks were done in just the last six days before Christmas. Two days before Christmas, NICS ran 102,222 background checks, which was the second-busiest day in history. The one-day record was set this year on Black Friday, the big shopping day following Thanksgiving, with 129,166 searches.  By comparison, the previous one-day high was set November 28, 2008, when gun dealers made slightly less than 98,000 requests for background searches. It's not possible to tell exactly how many guns have been purchased because buyers often take home more than one gun.  But most people pass the background checks. Only 1.3% of the searches result in people being denied permission to buy a weapon, said FBI spokesman Steve Fischer. FBI officials did not offer a theory on the spike in gun sales. It's also not clear how many of the background checks were for people who never had owned guns before and how many were for gunowners adding to their collections. The National Rifle Association says the figures indicate more people feel they need guns for self defense. ""I think there's an increased realization that when something bad occurs, it's going to be between them and the criminal,"" NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told CNN.  Arulandandum said Americans realize police cannot be everywhere there's trouble and also that some officers are being laid off due to budget cutting. The NRA spokesman also said an increased number of Americans are participating in skeet shooting and other gun sports. A leading gun-control organization says repeat buyers most likely are responsible for the holiday surge in guns sales. ""The research we've seen indicates fewer and fewer people are owning more and more guns,"" said Caroline Brewer of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""All the trends indicate the number of Americans who own guns has declined."" ""It would appear because of fear-mongering by the NRA since (President Barack) Obama's election that people are adding more guns to their arsenals out of fear Obama and the Democrats will take away their guns, which is absurd,"" said Brewer.","The one-month record for background checks was set in November -- over 1.5 million .

"Michael Jace, who played a Los Angeles cop in TV's ""The Shield,"" has been arrested in the fatal shooting of his wife, police said Tuesday. Police found April Jace, 40, shot to death in her south Los Angeles home Monday night, Los Angeles Police Det. Lyman Doster said. Michael Jace, 51, called  911 to report that his wife had been shot, Det. Dean Vinluan said, adding that he ""was on the phone with the operator."" Neighbors who heard gunshots also called 911, he said. ""At this moment, the motive of the murder is believed to be domestic violence,"" a police statement said. Investigators detained Jace at the couple's Hyde Park-area home Monday night and booked the actor on a homicide charge early Tuesday, according to Doster. Jace was booked into a Los Angeles jail with bail set at $1 million. CNN has been unable to find the name of any lawyer Jace may have hired to defend him in this homicide case.  He is not expected to appear in court before Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney said. Two children were in the home when their mother was shot, Vinluan said. The children, whose ages he would not reveal, were taken to a police station and then handed over to a representative of California's Department of Children and Family Services, he said. Investigators have found no reports of domestic violence between the husband and wife at their south Los Angeles residence, LAPD Det. Iasparro said. A woman described as a close friend of his first wife said in a sworn statement that she witnessed Jace physically abusing his wife in 1997. The declaration was in court records from Jace's 2005 custody case concerning his son with Jennifer Bitterman. Jace ""choked and hit"" his wife and ""slammed her against the wall while (their infant son) screamed in his crib next to her,"" Maria De Le Vegas said in the sworn declaration obtained by CNN. Jace ""was raging and out of control, and seeing the extent of his anger was one of the most terrifying things I have ever seen,"" she said. Jace appeared to be suffering severe financial strain in recent years, according to court documents obtained by CNN.  The actor filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2011, citing $500,000 in debts and an annual income of around $80,000 from residuals from his TV and film work, the documents said. Jace had defaulted on the $411,000 mortgage on the south Los Angeles home where his wife died, according to the documents.  His bankruptcy case is still active, according to his lawyer. He married April Jace in June 2003, a year after divorcing his first wife, with whom he shared a son who is now a teen. The FX police drama ""The Shield"" was the biggest and longest-running role in Jace's 22-year acting career. He appeared in 89 episodes as Julien Lowe, who started as a rookie officer in an inner-city Los Angeles police precinct in 2002 and rose through the ranks to become a detective before the series ended in 2008, according to the Internet Movie Database. He acted on several episodes of ""Southland,"" another TV drama about Los Angeles police, between 2009 and 2012. Jace often played a law enforcement or military officer on television shows. He is credited with roles in ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,"" ""Private Practice,"" ""The Mentalist,"" ""Burn Notice"" and ""NYPD Blue."" He had the title role of Michael Jordan in the 1999 TV movie about the NBA star, ""Michael Jordan: An American Hero."" Jace played Officer Brown in Russell Crowe's 2009 film ""State of Play,"" and he portrayed a Black Panther member in the 1994 blockbuster movie ""Forrest Gump."" April Jace had worked for the past year as a financial aid counselor at Biola University, a private school in La Mirada, California, according to the school. ""We are obviously shocked and saddened by this terrible news, to lose a wonderful colleague, mother and friend,"" Biola President Barry Corey said in a written statement. ""April's radiant personality brought great energy to the financial aid office,"" financial aid director Geoff Marsh said. ""Her love for helping students and families and her great work ethic earned the respect and love of her coworkers. Her smiling face and helpful spirit will be missed by all.""

"The windmilling fists and stomping feet rain down blows on the 13-year-old boy. Trapped on the floor between the bus seats, he cries out as he receives fierce punch after vicious kick from the three bigger, older youths. As the relentless assault unfolds, the driver of the Florida school bus alerts the dispatcher, pleading for aid. But he doesn't physically step in to help. The bus driver, at least according to his school's policy, did nothing wrong. The attack took place July 9 in Pinellas County, Florida. But the horrific cell phone video -- and the surveillance video -- came out only recently. As the boy is pummeled, the bus driver, John Moody, yells at the assailants to leave the boy alone. He also asks dispatchers to send help. ""You gotta get somebody here quick, quick, quick, quick,"" he says. ""They're about to beat this boy to death over here."" ""Please get somebody here quick. There's still doing it,"" he adds. ""There's nothing I can do."" 'Like a bad dream' Moody, 64,  said on CNN's Piers Morgan Live that he was calling for help on his radio, as school policy required. ""Me jumping in the middle of that fight with three boys, it would have been more dangerous for other students on the bus for as myself,"" he said. ""There's just no telling what might have happened."" Earlier, he told CNN affiliate WFLA he was ""in shock"" and ""petrified."" And he told CNN that watching the video is ""like a bad dream."" ""I took it really personal. I had many sleepless nights. I had nightmares,"" he said. Moody retired two weeks after the attack, after 18 years driving buses. The fight was ""the final straw -- and it was a big straw, too,"" he said. Police say the youths attacked the 13-year-old after he told officials at their dropout prevention school that one of them had tried to sell him drugs. The ferocity of the attack left the victim with two black eyes and a broken arm. Could your child be a bully? Criticism, but no basis for charges . Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent told WFLA that Moody should have stepped in. ""There was clearly an opportunity for him to intervene and or check on the welfare of the children or the child in this case, and he didn't make any effort to do so,"" Vincent said. But prosecutors say they have no grounds on which to bring charges. ""It wasn't like he was looking out the window cleaning his fingernails or something like that,"" said Chief Assistant State Attorney Bruce Bartlett, according to CNN affiliate WFLA. In 2012: New York teen says bullies beat and blinded him . According to Pinellas County school policy, the bus driver isn't required to intervene, only to call dispatch. He can step in, if he feels it's safe. Police said Moody could have given first aid to the victim after the attackers jumped off the bus, but Bartlett said the 13-year-old didn't hang around. ""The kid gets up and skedaddles out the door,"" he said. Outrageous moments caught on camera . Other counties actually forbid drivers from physically stopping fights. And Moody's lawyer, Frank McDermott, said the complaints about Moody are unfair. Other students ""would have been put in huge danger had he tried to physically intervene,"" McDermott said. And he said ""a lot of attention"" should be focused on school administrators, whom he suggested could have done more to prevent the beating. ""School officials let these two boys back on the bus, or let them on the bus, and Mr. Moody had no idea what had happened at the school,"" McDermott said.","Bus driver says intervening would have made things worse .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Ross Lovegrove is widely regarded as one of the most important and innovative contemporary industrial designers. Ross Lovegrove with a model of the capsule to be built on Moritz Craffonara's private mountain in Italy. And he doesn't disappoint on the innovation front with his latest project. Lovegrove -- famous for his tactile and fluid sensual forms -- has teamed up with a private client who dreams of sleeping under the stars atop his private mountain in the Alps. With money seemingly no object, Lovegrove has designed what he calls an ''alpine capsule,"" to fulfill the wishes of restaurateur and club owner Moritz Craffonara, who has lived in the Badia region of Italy for more than 40 years. The capsule bed will be mirrored on the outside but transparent on the inside to take advantage of a 360 degree view of the breathtaking landscape. Lovegrove describes the capsule bed as an ""incredible ethereal space. You lie on this irregular shaped bed, maybe you can play classical music or something that is going to stimulate your senses and then you are going to marvel at this 360 degree view around you, I couldn't think of a better way to wake up in the morning,"" he tells CNN. The bed will be built within a couple of years according to the designer, who hopes that it will attract people from all over the world. See  some of Ross Lovegrove's designs. » . Placing a seemingly incongruous space-age pod on a mountain top in the middle of the Alps is something Lovegrove has no qualms about doing. He said: ""In areas like this where they predominantly build from wood and you see the very old buildings, they are very beautiful, they work in total harmony with their environment and I'm not looking to interfere with that at all. It's worse for me to design a hybrid type of structure that is trying to tastefully fit in."" For him, the capsule is part of what he calls ""a new nature,"" -- a man-made situation ""that brings in the positive aspects of man's material and technological potential."" ""I'm interested in developing an aesthetic for the 21st century which comes from the intelligent use of resources, materials and structures,"" he says. Away from his client work, one of Lovegrove's projects is the ""Car on a Stick,"" an electric bubble car that turns into an elevated streetlight at night. This style typifies Lovegrove's methods of blending organic inspiration with a fresh approach to function, cutting-edge manufacturing technologies. In the early 1980s, he worked on the Sony Walkman and and the Apple iMac and over  his long and varied career, has worked with a wide range of influential clients including Airbus Industries, Peugeot, Issey Miyake,  Tag Heuer, Herman Miller. Above all, the common theme of Lovegrove's design is the passion that imbues them.","Industrial designer Ross Lovegrove is known for his organic, flowing forms .

"One day after South Korea staged exercises near Yeonpyeong Island marking the anniversary of North Korea's deadly shelling, the North's military threatened ""a sea of fire"" upon the South's presidential office, the South's Yonhap News Agency reported Thursday. A year ago Wednesday, North Korea launched an attack on the civilian island of Yeonpyeong, killing two marines and two civilians and shattering the sense of security that South Koreans had enjoyed for almost 60 years. The island shelling came half a year after North Korea torpedoed a naval ship, the Cheonan, killing 46 sailors. North Korea's military supreme command denounced the South's anniversary exercise as a rehearsal for war against the North and warned that the North's armed forces are ready for ""a decisive battle to counter any military provocation,"" Yonhap reported. If South Korea dares ""to impair the dignity of (the North) again and fire one bullet or shell toward its inviolable territorial waters, sky and land, the deluge of fire on Yonphyong Island will lead to that in Chongwadae and the sea of fire in Chongwadae to the deluge of fire sweeping away the stronghold of the group of traitors,"" the command said in an official (North) Korean Central News Agency account, according to Yonhap. The North Korean statement used a different spelling for both the shelled South Korean island and Cheong Wa Dae, Korea's presidential offices, Yonhap reported. South Korea's defense ministry had no immediate comment, Yonhap reported. North Korea invoked identical rhetoric in 1994, when Pyongyang had expelled international nuclear inspectors and threatened to turn Seoul into a ""sea of fire."" With the United States mulling air strikes on North Korean facilities in 1994, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter flew into Pyongyang to meet Kim Il Sung, and that set the scene for the so-called ""Agreed Framework"" under which North Korea would give up its nuclear facilities in return for light water reactors from the international community.","North Korea makes 'sea of fire' threat after South Korea holds exercises .

"Vitriolic insults hurled by North Korea's state-run media are so frequent that they're usually not news. But recent KCNA articles use such racially-charged rhetoric that they have drawn criticism from the White House's National Security Council, which called them ""particularly ugly and disrespectful."" North Korea's state media KCNA described President Barack Obama using racial epithets and likened him to a ""wicked black monkey."" The most offensive piece, published in Korean on May 2 under the title ""Divine punishment to the world's one and only delinquent Obama,"" repeatedly refers to him as a monkey. ""You can also tell this by his appearance and behavior, and while it may be because he is a crossbreed, one cannot help thinking the more one sees him that he has escaped from a monkey's body,"" it stated. It's not unusual for North Korea's propagandists to hurl vitriol at state leaders -- especially those from the U.S. and South Korea. But the intensity and sheer volume of racial slurs in this latest piece surprised North Korea watchers. Recently, KCNA has directed misogynistic slurs at South Korea's President Park Geun-hye, calling her an ""indecent philistine and vile prostitute serving the U.S."" They've accused her of bungling the Sewol ferry accident and criticized her close association with U.S., saying  she has a mental disease. South Korean president apologizes for response to ferry sinking . The racist rant on Obama was flagged by a blog, One Free Korea, which started the entry with, ""Oh, yes they did"" and highlighted excerpts from the epithet-laced official news service.

"OAKLAND, California (CNN)  -- Oakland's bid to become the first U.S. city to tax proceeds on medical marijuana passed Tuesday by a landslide vote. About 80 percent of people voting in the Oakland election approved the new medical marijuana tax. About 80 percent of voters chose to impose the tax on Oakland's medical marijuana facilities, according to the Alameda County Registrar of Voters. Some celebrated the news at Oaksterdam University by hand-rolling large marijuana cigarettes or stuffing cannabis into pipes. The school trains students for work in the medical marijuana industry. ""It is important because the city of Oakland is facing a massive deficit like many jurisdictions in California,"" said Steve DeAngelo, a leader of one of the city's cannabis clubs. ""And we decided to step up to the plate and make a contribution to the city in a time of need."" DeAngelo, one of the people who led the effort to get the tax approved, said his business will now have to pay more than $350,000 from the new tax next year.  Watch report from CNN's Dan Simon » . Oakland's City Council was also behind the move. ""Given that the medical cannabis dispensaries are something that was legalized in California, why not have revenue from it?"" said councilwoman Rebecca Kaplan. There was no formal opposition to the effort, but some drug fighters say the tax sends the wrong message. ""The taxation of a federally unlawful drug is just not something that the community should accept,"" said Paul Chabot of the Coalition for a Drug Free California. ""With the state in dire straits in finances and the country looking for ways to pay down debt, looking at illegal drugs is the absolute wrong thing to do."" The measure, passed in special mail-in election Tuesday, imposes a 1.8 percent gross receipts tax on the four licensed medical cannabis dispensaries in Oakland. These facilities would have to pay about $18 in taxes for every 1,000 in marijuana sales. CNN's Dan Simon contributed to this report.","80% of voters choose to impose tax on Oakland's medical marijuana facilities .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Jazz musician Wynton Marsalis knows how important education is for youth, but what feeds their minds and souls, he says, often lies beyond traditional classroom walls. Musician Wynton Marsalis co-founded Jazz at Lincoln Center to broaden and inspire jazz audiences. ""The most essential thing for the development of kids and their understanding of the world are those things they do that's not school-related -- just any extracurricular activity,"" the Pulitzer Prize winner said. ""When you have activities you learn at a young age, you can do whatever you put your mind to!"" Marsalis, 47, co-founded Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York. As part of its goal to inspire and cultivate jazz audiences, Jazz at Lincoln Center sponsors youth events including an annual nationwide high school jazz band competition and festival, a Band Director's Academy and a popular concert series for kids. ""Jazz helps younger kids, especially, to connect with their innermost feelings and learn that [there's] nothing wrong with being real,"" Marsalis said. To Marsalis, jazz performer and instructor Davey Yarborough does just that. Yarborough provides Washington youth the opportunity and guidance to nurture their musical talents, not only as an educator at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts but also at his nonprofit jazz arts institute. Marsalis met Yarborough in the 1980s during one of his performance trips to the nation's capital and was struck by Yarborough's dedication to the students. ""I will see him at events, concerts. ... He always has kids with him,"" Marsalis said. ""He teaches all of his kids with the same intensity and feeling, and gives them that same feeling of specialness. It's something that can't be contrived.""  Watch Marsalis describe how Yarborough inspires young people » . Yarborough, 55, says his motivation and inspiration stems, in part, from tragedy. After the 1988 death of one of his Duke Ellington students, Anthony Nash, in a drug trafficking incident, Yarborough decided to create a program geared toward music enrichment and mentorship during off-school hours. ""To have an element of the street take a student that was so bright and so promising was a trigger for me,"" Yarborough recalled. ""I knew all the students [as] family, and I want to know what's going on as much as I can with the students I am working with."" Yarborough established a free summer-school music program at Duke Ellington to provide his students with a ""safe space"" where they could develop their skills. But when some school music programs in his district were cut, Yarborough noticed that many other students who had a desire to learn an instrument no longer had an opportunity to play or nurture their talent. ""The realization that I could only cater to the students at Ellington spurred the idea of 'OK, we need to take this into the community,' "" Yarborough said. After obtaining donated space in his local D.C. church, Yarborough and his wife, jazz vocalist Esther Williams, created the nonprofit Washington Jazz Arts Institute. Designed to serve those students who were ""left out"" by the school system or ""left behind"" by competitive Duke Ellington auditions, Yarborough says, the institute provides young local musicians with free jazz instruction, lectures, professional workshops and paid performance opportunities. They also have a mentoring system of professional artists. ""I wanted to really be able to see the students develop,"" Yarborough said. ""Once a young person decides they want to be a musician, such as I did in the third grade, they have a support system that takes them all the way through their career."" Since its inception in 1998, more than 1,000 students have taken free music enrichment classes at the Washington Jazz Arts Institute. ""He loves those students,"" Marsalis said. ""There's no question that his kids have a much greater appreciation of jazz, but larger than [that], they have an appreciation of other people and of humanity and what we can all do if we invest in each other. They learn [that] from being in his presence.""","Wynton Marsalis co-founded Jazz at Lincoln Center to cultivate, inspire audiences .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, flashing a broad smile, declared victory Tuesday in the country's 25-year civil war against the Tamil Tiger rebels. A crowd beside a portrait of Sri Lanka's president celebrate the country's military victory on May 18. ""We are celebrating the defeat of terrorism,"" he said in a nationally televised speech before parliament. ""We have won and restored democracy in the country."" Rajapaksa announced that Wednesday would be a national holiday, to celebrate the war's end and begin a new phase in the country's history. It is time for Sri Lanka to build ""a new country ... a new nation,"" he said, calling ""the defeat of Tamil terrorism ... a victory for the Tamil people."" ""What have they given the Tamil people?"" Rajapaksa asked, suggesting that the war had cost them far more than they had gained. With the war over, he said, Sri Lanka would begin to restore government services to Tamil areas. The United Nations, meanwhile, urged the government to provide more for the 65,000 people who had fled the last fighting in the past few days. It said there were now 265,000 displaced people in the country. A short time after the presidential address, the military announced that it had recovered the body of Tamil Tiger founder and leader Velupillai Prabhakaran. A local television station aired video it said showed his body. The ""psychopathic leader of the world's most barbaric terrorist outfit ... has been found,"" confirmed Gen. Sarath Fonseka, commander of the Sri Lankan army, according to the Ministry of Defense Web site. ""Troops ... have found the bullet ridden body of the terrorist leader lying on the bank of the Nanthikadal lagoon,"" the ministry reported.  Watch more on aftermath of fighting » . But earlier in the day, the pro-rebel Web site Tamilnet.com reported that the Tigers' leader was ""alive and safe,"" countering previous military claims. The defense ministry said Prabhakaran and 18 other senior rebel leaders were among the bodies found in mop-up operations, after government troops routed the Tigers -- formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The leaders included Prabhakaran's eldest son, Charles Anthony, as well as Pottu Amman, the Tigers' intelligence leader, according to the ministry. ""Our beloved leader Velupillai is alive and safe,"" rebel spokesman Selvarasa Pathmanathan said, according to Tamilnet.com. ""He will continue to lead the quest for dignity and freedom for the Tamil people."" CNN has been unable to independently confirm the accounts because of access and safety reasons. News of Prabhakaran's death was greeted with pro-Tamil marches elsewhere in the world, with around 2,000 gathering outside parliament in London and others protesting in front of the White House in Washington. Prabhakaran founded the rebel group, which has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries. It pioneered the use of women in suicide attacks and, according to the FBI, invented the explosive suicide belt. It was also behind the assassination of two world leaders -- the only terrorist organization to do so. Prabhakaran is accused of masterminding the killing of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in the Tamil-dominated Indian state of Tami Nadu as he campaigned for a second term. Sri Lankan authorities allege that Prabhakaran was avenging Gandhi's decision to send Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka. Two years later a Tigers suicide bomber, allegedly acting under Prabhakaran's orders, detonated explosives that killed Sri Lanka's then-president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, during a rally. Over the weekend, the militants offered to ""silence"" their guns after an intense military offensive decimated their ranks, pushed them from their stronghold in the north and east of the country, and cornered the remaining rebels on a small stretch of land.  Watch aid agencies fear for Sri Lanka » . Prabhakaran's supporters considered him a hero with a single-minded focus -- to fight for the rights of his people. The Sri Lankan government deemed him a war criminal with a disregard for civilian casualties. He was wanted by Interpol on charges including terrorism and organized crime. In the past it has been reported he wore a cyanide capsule around his neck -- to swallow and kill himself rather than risk capture. And he reportedly expected the same dedication from his troops. As a result, few Tigers have been captured alive. The rebels have fought for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since July 1983. An estimated 70,000 to 80,000 people have died during the quarter century of fighting. Journalist Iqbal Athas contributed to this report.","NEW: Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa declares victory in civil war .

"I grew up in a Philadelphia suburb called Doylestown. Actually when my parents — Philadelphia natives — first moved there in the late 1970s, it barely qualified as a suburb; cornfields and dairy farms still filled the open land around the quaint Victorian town center. It was, I recognize now, a lovely place to be a kid, if incredibly boring during the actual process of growing up. But even then I knew it was one thing: safe. There was little violent crime to speak of, especially compared with the crumbling city my parents had left. Blood-soaked local newscasts during the 1980s made it seem as if murder were Philadelphia's No. 1 product — and the City of Brotherly Love, where homicides peaked at 503 in 1990, was hardly alone in being seen by Americans as fundamentally unsafe. It was the underlying message of nearly every TV cop show and film thriller made through the 1980s and '90s: The city is dangerous, and you're lucky to get out alive. Many of America's cities have become much safer in the years since, for reasons that range from better policing to the slowdown of the crack epidemic of the 1980s to the removal of lead from the environment. Even in Philadelphia, where the economy is still struggling and population has never recovered from the urban flight of the 1970s and '80s, there were 329 murders in 2012, down significantly from the worst years a couple of decades ago. Other cities have experienced even more astounding turnarounds: in New York, where I live now, there were just 414 homicides in a city of 8.2 million, the lowest number in more than half a century. But those statistics aren't convincing the country that cities are getting safer: a 2011 Gallup poll found that most Americans continue to believe that the nation's crime rate is getting worse, even though there's been a sharp and sustained drop in murders and other violent assaults since the mid-1990s. Perception — no doubt fueled in part by the media — beats reality. But even with crime down, surely it's still safer to live in the quiet countryside than it is in the city? It turns out that's not true. According to a new study (PDF) published today in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, large cities in the United States are significantly safer than rural areas. The risk of injury death — which counts both violent crime and accidents — is more than 20% higher in the countryside than it is in large urban areas. ""Perceptions have long existed that cities were innately more dangerous than areas outside of cities, but our study shows this is not the case,"" said the lead author, Dr. Sage R. Myers of the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in a statement. Far from being violent death traps, a large city might just about be the safest place to live in the United States. TIME.com: Get the lead out of poor countries . Now it's true that the risk of homicide is greater in big cities than it is in the countryside. But the study, which analyzed 1,295,919 deaths from injury between 1999 and 2006, found the rate of dying from an unintentional injury is over 15 times higher than that of homicide for the population as a whole. Whether you live in rural areas or the city, you're much less likely to die from a gunshot wound — either from someone else or self-inflicted — than you are in a simple accident. Especially car crashes, which make up the bulk of unintentional injury deaths — motor-vehicle-injury-related deaths occurred at a rate that is more than 1.4 times higher than the next leading cause of death. The study doesn't attempt to explain why injury death is more common in rural areas than large urban ones, but some of the statistics are telling. The risk of firearm-related death showed no difference across the rural-urban spectrum for the population as a whole, but varied when divided up by age — firearm deaths were significantly higher for children and people ages 45 and older, while for people ages 20 to 44, the risk of firearm deaths were much higher in urban areas. I'd wager some of that comes down to differences in gun ownership: more households have firearms in rural areas than in urban ones, and sadly, too many gun owners keep their firearms where their children can reach them. The result can be tragic. At the same time, the bulk of victims killed by homicide are young men, according to FBI statistics. And they are more likely to be shot and killed in the cities. TIME.com: Ranking North America's greenest cities . But guns — whether used accidentally or with intent — are much less likely to be the cause of death than another tool: cars. And people drive more, drive longer, drive faster and drive drunker in rural areas than in urban ones, where they can walk or take public transit. Motor-vehicle crashes led to 27.61 deaths per 100,000 people in most rural areas, and just 10.58 deaths per 100,000 people. Those are stark statistics, and they don't even take into account the cardiovascular benefits that may accrue to urbanites who spend more time walking than riding in cars. It's not for nothing that New Yorkers, who live in the densest urban area in the U.S., live about 2.2 years longer than the national average. Of course, not all cities are equally safe — Chicago has seen a terrifying rise in gun deaths in recent years, and there's nothing safe about a bankrupt and broken city like Detroit, where it can take 58 minutes on average for police to answer a 911 call. (Even there most urban areas have an advantage, though — you're likely to be much closer to the nearest hospital in a dense city than the spread-out countryside, and minutes matter when it comes to trauma.) But the numbers don't lie — as scary as we may think urban crime is, the threats that are prevalent in rural areas are statistically more dangerous. We already know that the best way to shrink your carbon footprint is to move to a dense city. Now it turns out that it might be the best way to stay alive too. This story was originally published on TIME.com .","The risk of injury death is more than 20% higher in the country than it is in urban areas .

"(CNN)Naya Rivera can't help but turn heads, and it's not just the Glee star's singing, dancing and eye-catching outfits. Sometimes it's what comes out of her mouth, like her recent comments on ""The View"" about white people bathing too much. Regardless of how much you shower, Naya Rivera is the gift that keeps giving to celebrity watchers like ourselves. In light of her latest comments, we thought it high time to take a look at five provocative things that Rivera -- at the tender age of 28 -- has already said in a short but outspoken lifetime. White people shower a lot. ""I think that white people shower a lot more than ethnic,"" said Rivera, who was a guest host on the Tuesday edition of ""The View."" ""I feel like showering more than once a day or every day is such a white people thing."" ""My mom is half black, half Puerto Rican. She showers every day, so I can say this."" And her husband, who is white? He often showers several times per day. Case closed! Not so fast. Rivera apologized for any offense she caused the next day on ""The View."" Kim Kardashian: Lay off the nude photo shoots! ""I normally don't. But... you're someone's mother..."" said Rivera, posting on Instagram. The ""you"" is the famous for not-doing-much Kim Kardashian, who had posed au natural for Paper magazine. Faced with a backlash from lovers of all things Kardashian, Rivera—who can actually sing and dance and act—apologized via Instagram. Both men and women like her a lot.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The United States and Afghanistan signed a long-delayed security agreement Tuesday that will allow U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond the previous December deadline to withdraw. The deal was signed by Afghan National Security Adviser Mohammad Hanif Atmar and U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan James Cunningham during a ceremony in Kabul. The future of the U.S. military's presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014 had been in doubt. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai negotiated the security deal but then reneged, and it became clear that no agreement would be signed until after presidential elections this year. In February, the Obama administration announced for the first time that it had begun planning for the possible withdrawal of all U.S. troops by the end of 2014 if Afghanistan did not sign the agreement, which spells out the rights of U.S. troops operating there. But both major Afghan presidential candidates pledged that they would sign the deal if elected this year. After an election in which results were delayed by accusations of voting fraud, former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani signed a power-sharing deal with rival candidate Abdullah Abdullah, and Ghani was sworn in as president on Monday. Obama hails 'historic day' U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed the signing of the security agreement, which he said was the culmination of two years of hard work by both sides. ""Today, we mark an historic day in the U.S.-Afghan partnership that will help advance our shared interests and the long-term security of Afghanistan,"" he said in a statement. Afghan and NATO officials also signed a deal Tuesday allowing allied forces to continue a NATO support mission after the end of this year, he said. ""These agreements follow an historic Afghan election in which the Afghan people exercised their right to vote and ushered in the first peaceful democratic transfer of power in their nation's history,"" Obama said. ""We look forward to working with this new government to cement an enduring partnership that strengthens Afghan sovereignty, stability, unity and prosperity and that contributes to our shared goal of defeating al Qaeda and its extremist affiliates."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry congratulated Ghani and Abdullah, as well as the Afghan people. ""Afghans have taken a moment of challenge and turned it into a moment of real opportunity,"" he said. He also paid tribute to the contributions of Karzai, saying that while America's relationship with him has been ""punctuated by disagreements,"" he is recognized by the world as ""a nationalist, a patriot and an important figure who stepped forward when his country needed him."" Taliban: 'Death to America' Even with the agreement, the United States is poised to wind down its military involvement in Afghanistan. Obama has said that under the security agreement, virtually all U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016, shortly before his presidency ends. He has called for 9,800 U.S. troops to stay there after the end of 2014, along with some allied forces. The number would get cut roughly in half by the end of 2015, and a year later, the U.S. military presence would scale down to what officials described as a ""normal"" embassy security contingent. Meanwhile, the Taliban, who were ousted from power in Afghanistan by a U.S.-led military coalition in 2001, have continued to mount deadly attacks on high-profile Afghan targets and are fighting fiercely for control of important areas in the country. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid posted a succinct message on Twitter shortly after the security deal was signed Tuesday: ""Death to America!"" CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul. CNN's Jason Hanna reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Kevin Liptak, Elise Labott and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","NEW: President Barack Obama hails ""historic day"" that will aid long-term Afghan security .

"Defying warnings from the international community, North Korea launched a long-range rocket on Friday, but it broke apart before escaping the earth's atmosphere and fell into the sea, officials said. ""It flew about a minute, and it flew into the ocean,"" said Noriyuki Shikata, a spokesman for Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. He added that Japanese authorities ""have not identified any negative impacts, so far,"" though he said the international ramifications could be significant. ""This is something that we think is a regrettable development,"" he said. Joseph Cirincione, president of the global security foundation The Ploughshares Fund, told CNN that the launch's apparent failure ""shows the weakness of the North Korea missile program"" and suggests that the threat from North Korea has been ""exaggerated."" ""It's a humiliation,"" he told CNN. ""I wouldn't want to be a North Korean rocket scientist today."" In an unusual admission of failure, the North Korean state media announced that the rocket had not managed to put an observation satellite into orbit, which Pyongyang had insisted was the purpose of the launch. In the past, North Korea has insisted that failed launches have been successful. ""Scientists, technicians and experts are now looking into the cause of the failure,"" the official Korean Central News Agency said in a report, which was also read out in a news broadcast on state-run television. The United States, South Korea and other countries see the launch as a cover for a ballistic missile test. ""Our government strongly criticizes their action,"" said South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Sung Hwan. ""They have ignored the starvation of their people and spent money on missiles. It is very unfortunate."" NHK Television of Japan, citing an official with the Japanese Defense Ministry, said the rocket broke into four pieces before falling. The North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command officials tracked the missile, which they identified as a North Korean Taepo Dong-2 missile. ""Initial indications are that the first stage of the missile fell into the sea 165 km west of Seoul, South Korea,"" they said in a news release. ""The remaining stages were assessed to have failed and no debris fell on land.  At no time were the missile or the resultant debris a threat."" The incident demonstrates an ""unblemished track record of failure,"" said a U.S. official, who credited international sanctions for preventing Pyongyang from obtaining needed materials. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement that Pyongyang ""can expect a strong response from the international community if it continues to develop its missile and nuclear capabilities."" South Korea's Yonhap Television News, quoting a South Korean defense ministry official, said debris appeared to have landed 190 to 210 kilometers off Gunsan's west coast, near the Yellow Sea. The U.N. Security Council will meet Friday on the launch, two U.N. diplomats and a U.S. official told CNN. The meeting had previously been scheduled, U.S. officials said. At the United Nations, diplomats had warned that Pyongyang would face further isolation if it went ahead. The U.S. official said that, despite the launch's failure, ""it will not change our response."" The White House press secretary, in a statement, said the failed launch ""threatens regional security, violates international law and contravenes its own recent commitments."" The statement added, ""North Korea is only further isolating itself by engaging in provocative acts, and is wasting its money on weapons and propaganda displays while the North Korean people go hungry."" ""This was supposed to be associated with (Kim Jong Un's) ascension to power. So for this thing to fail ... is incredibly embarrassing,"" said Victor Cha, former director of Asian affairs for the U.S. National Security Council and now a Georgetown University professor. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said the rocket remained in the air for slightly more than a minute and did not affect Japanese territory. After the failure, the Japanese government held a security meeting. The launch occurred at 7:39 a.m. Friday, NORAD said. Immediately afterward, the South Korean military dispatched helicopters and ships in an attempt to find debris related to the rocket launch, according to YTN. When is a missile not a missile? International leaders had urged North Korea to cancel the launch, but Pyongyang refused to back down, insisting the operation is for peaceful purposes. In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney had said the launch would be a ""significant and clear demonstration of bad faith"" on the part of the North, making it impossible for the United States to follow through on the food-aid deal. South Korea described the planned move as a ""grave provocation"" and said it would respond with ""appropriate countermeasures."" Meanwhile, the Philippines and South Korea ordered commercial planes and fishing boats to stay clear of the rocket's proposed path. ""This launch will give credence to the view that North Korean leaders see improved relations with the outside world as a threat to the existence of their system,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said this week. ""And recent history strongly suggests that additional provocations may follow."" A recent report from South Korean intelligence officials said that North Korea is planning a new nuclear test in the area where it staged previous atomic blasts. The South Korean intelligence report noted that the two previous rocket launches that Pyongyang said were intended to put satellites into orbit were followed a few weeks or months later by nuclear tests. Rocket launch may provide intelligence windfall . The last time Pyongyang carried out what it described as a satellite launch, in April 2009, the U.N. Security Council condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated. That rocket traveled 2,300 miles before its third stage fell into the Pacific Ocean. And in 2006, a missile failed after about 40 seconds into flight. Vitaly Churkin, Russia's U.N. ambassador, told reporters outside the Security Council chambers that members don't have ""clear agreement"" about what steps to take if the launch goes ahead. ""But one thing I can tell you: We have unanimity of understanding that if it were to happen, that would be a clear violation of two Security Council resolutions."" And Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., warned, ""Every time they go down a path such as this, their isolation intensifies, the needs of their people increase and they become more and more out of the bounds of the international community. That will be the case if they do so."" Meanwhile, Chinese Ambassador Li Baodong said countries need ""to do everything possible to defuse tension rather than inflame the situation there."" China is North Korea's leading ally. The launch came amid North Korean preparations to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea who ruled the Communist state for more than four decades. His birthday on April 15, known as the ""Day of the Sun,"" is a key public holiday. On Wednesday, North Korea's ruling Workers' Party held a special conference that helped firm up the position of Kim's grandson, Kim Jong Un, the secretive state's new leader. Korean television showed a somber Kim standing beneath two towering statues of his grandfather and his late father, Kim Jong Il, while receiving applause from party functionaries and the military. Kim Jong Il was given the title of ""eternal general secretary"" of the Workers' Party, while Kim Jong Un was named the party's first secretary. The title appears to be a newly created position that sets the stage for a virtual coronation of Kim Jong Un, says North Korea watcher Jonathan Pollack of the Washington-based Brookings Institution. ""Creating this new position is sort of like retiring a jersey number for a famous baseball player,"" Pollack said. ""It shows a deference to his father and to the old guard, while still cementing his control on power."" North Korea announced other titles for Kim Jong Un, including making him a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission. Kim Jong Un was already being described as the supreme leader of the party, state and army. But it is unclear how directly the young Kim, thought to be in his late 20s, is involved in policy decisions. The leadership transition bears similarities to the previous transfer of power from one generation of the Kim family to another. ""Kim Jong Il is now venerated at the same level as his father, buried in the same tomb, and they are making statues of them riding together on horseback,"" Pollack said. ""But Kim Jong Un never got the on-the-job training his father did, so he may have this title to allow some mentoring or sharing power and decisions with his elders.""","North Korean state media say the launch failed to put satellite in orbit .

"Ukrainian security forces battled pro-Russian militants in the eastern flashpoint city of Slovyansk on Monday as Kiev tackled the gunmen who have overrun the region. Military gains were evident on the main highway into Slovyansk, a rebel stronghold, as government forces moved in. A CNN team on the ground saw a substantial number of militants bolster their defensive positions and checkpoints inside the city. One civilian car was hit in the fighting, its exterior damaged by bullet holes. At a local hospital, the CNN team saw several people injured from the heavy clashes. One woman had been shot in the head, probably in a crossfire, and two pro-Russian militants were also brought in. Ukraine's Interior Ministry said four people were killed and nearly 30 injured in the city. It quoted local residents as saying the attackers had shot at residential buildings and set them on fire. Militants blamed Ukrainian forces for the civilian casualties. In a separate statement, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said a military helicopter was shot down ""during a combat mission and patrolling in the area"" of Slovyansk on Monday, but the pilots survived after it crashed into a river. They were later rescued. Ukraine's embattled new leaders have launched their most intensive effort yet to dislodge pro-Russian separatists who have reportedly seized government buildings in nearly a dozen cities and towns. Kiev authorities describe the separatists as ""terrorists."" But the rebels say they are defending Russian-speaking areas of the east against Ukrainian  ""fascists"" trying to root out Russian influence in the country. In a statement Monday, Russia's Foreign Ministry accused the Kiev government of ""continuing a war against the people of their own country."" ""We again urge the Kiev organizers of terror against their own people to come to their senses, stop the bloodshed, withdraw troops and sit down, finally, at the negotiating table to start a normal dialogue on ways to resolve the political crisis,"" the ministry said. Many experts say Russia may be provoking unrest in eastern Ukraine to justify an incursion. Riot-hit Odessa . The uprisings began when President Viktor Yanukovych, a supporter of closer ties with Moscow, was toppled by demonstrations led by pro-Western figures in February, namely in Kiev, the capital. Violence soon erupted in the east and south of the country, escalating dramatically last week. On Sunday, pro-Russian sympathizers smashed their way into a police station in the Black Sea port city of Odessa, demanding their detained comrades be released. In another victory for a violent crowd in east Ukraine and yet another humiliation for state authorities, police didn't try to stop them. Instead, they offered the crowd a deal, releasing 67 alleged enemies of the state if the furious crowd went home. Sunday's storming of the Odessa police station -- just two days after more than 40 people were killed in a street battle and deadly blaze in the city -- was one more example of how Ukraine's new Western-backed leaders are struggling to maintain law and order in the south and east of the country. It also raises questions about the ability of the army and police to confront an uprising that Kiev says is backed by Moscow -- an accusation the Kremlin denies. The men released Sunday had been detained over the weekend after bloody clashes between supporters and opponents of Russia in Odessa on Friday, which ended in the deadly blaze. Forty-six people were killed in the bloodshed -- the deadliest since Yanukovych was ousted. Video posted on YouTube appeared to show supporters of Kiev's government throwing Molotov cocktails at the building where pro-Russian separatists had reportedly taken up positions. The footage, which CNN could not independently confirm, showed people sitting on ledges trying to escape the fire and thick smoke. In an attempt to reassert Kiev's authority, Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk went to Odessa to appeal for unity while accusing Russia of provoking the clashes. Ukraine's Cabinet said it would offer financial assistance to the victims' families. ""This is the wake-up call for the entire country, for reconciliation. We need to realize that Russians want to eliminate our country,"" Yatsenyuk said. His message is a tough sell in a city where so many now believe people who speak Russian are being killed and arrested by forces loyal to the Ukrainian government. Military action . Ukraine's government reported some progress over the weekend in its military campaign. Officials said security forces had regained control of a TV tower in Kramatorsk, some 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Slovyansk. Residents in Kramatorsk reported hearing gunfire and a CNN team on the outskirts of Kramatorsk saw troop carriers moving toward the city center Saturday. Amateur video posted online -- the authenticity of which could not be confirmed by CNN -- showed burned buses, plumes of smoke and residents calmly observing it all. Saturday actually featured a rare bright spot in the volatility: the release of seven international military observers and five Ukrainians from the Defense Ministry who had been held hostage for eight days in Slovyansk. However, in another challenge to Kiev, separatist leader Valeriy Bolotov in Luhansk declared a state of emergency and announced the formation of a ""South-East"" army for the entire region. In a video statement aired on local stations, Bolotov introduced a curfew, a ban on political parties and his expectation that local law enforcement officials will take an oath of allegiance to the people of Luhansk. In Donetsk, separatists say they are preparing their own referendum on May 11 to ask residents whether they want sovereignty from Ukraine -- an echo of events that led to Moscow wresting Crimea from Kiev. Denis Pushilin, the self-declared chairman of the Donetsk People's Republic, told CNN the question on the ballot paper would read: ""Do you support the act of state sovereignty of the Donetsk Republic?"" to which voters can respond with ""Yes"" or ""No."" He said enough ballot papers had already been printed to hold the vote. Tensions with Russia . Separatists -- many of them of Russian descent -- say they believe the government in Kiev is illegitimate because it formed after what they call the illegal ousting of Yanukovych in February. Officials in Kiev accuse Moscow of meddling by supporting the separatists. NATO has estimated that up to 40,000 Russian troops are now near the border with Ukraine, which has made Kiev's government and neighboring nations wary of invasion. A senior U.S. official told CNN on Monday that the latest intelligence still showed 40,000 to 50,000 Russian troops on the border. ""There has been no major change in force disposition or readiness and no indications of preparations for an invasion,"" the official said, adding that the U.S. continues to assess the situation. The troops are so close to the border, an invasion could happen with little or no warning, the official said. Russia and the West squared off diplomatically over the fate of Ukraine when Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in March after a hastily called referendum and Yanukovych's ouster. He was pushed from office after months of protests by people upset that he had turned away from Europe in favor of Moscow. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius warned Monday there could be fresh sanctions on Russia if Ukraine's presidential elections do not take place on May 25. Russia has condemned Kiev's military action in the volatile east. Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, said Russia's government had received thousands of calls since Friday from people in southeastern Ukraine. The callers described the situation as ""horrendous"" and pleaded for Russia's involvement. ""Most of the people literally demand active help from Russia,"" he said. The government in Kiev is bracing for further unrest in the run-up to May 9, a national holiday to commemorate the end of the second world war. Interim President Oleksandr Turchynov  told local TV that checkpoints had been set up around the capital in case of possible ""provocations.""","Russia accuses Kiev of waging war on its own people .

"Barack Obama and Mitt Romney resumed campaigning Monday, with both men focusing on the economy as key to their chances of winning the votes of Americans in November. Obama told supporters in Cincinnati that he entered office four years ago seeking to restore ""the basic bargain that made America the greatest nation on Earth."" He cited the idea that ""if you work hard, then you can get ahead; if you're responsible, then you can live out your dreams. You're not confined to the circumstances of your birth."" Romney, meanwhile, said in a TV interview that ""in my opinion, the issue people care about is who can get the American economy going again to help people have a brighter future, with rising wages and more capacity to care for their kids and to know that their kids will get good jobs when they come out of school. ""That's what this campaign is about,"" the presumptive GOP nominee said on ""Fox & Friends."" Obama said he entered office at a time that the American dream ""was slipping away from too many people"" and that ""incomes and wages were flat-lining while the cost of everything -- from college to health care to groceries to gas -- were all going up."" He said his goal has been to reclaim that dream, but that he recognized when he became president that ""it might take more than one term, maybe more than one president"" to do so. Speaking from New Hampshire, Romney focused on Obama's performance in office and found it wanting: ""There are 23 million people that are out of work and (who have) stopped looking for work,"" he said. ""Median income has dropped 10% over the last four years. The American people know whether things are better now than they were four years ago ... he (Obama) just hasn't been able to do the job he told us he was going to try to do."" But Obama sought to deflect the blame and appealed to his audience for support. ""The problem is that we've got a stalemate right now in Washington,"" he said. ""This election is about more than just two candidates or political parties. It's about two different visions about how do we build a strong economy. The good news is you're the tie-breaker. The choice is up to you."" Obama also cited a new report that estimates that Romney's support for eliminating U.S. taxes on American companies' foreign incomes would create an incentive for U.S. companies to move more of their jobs overseas. Gergen: Facts don't support Obama's claims . ""We have not found any serious economic study that says Governor Romney's economic plan would actually create jobs until today,"" Obama said. ""I've got to be honest, today we found out there's a new study out by nonpartisan economists that says Governor Romney's economic plan would, in fact, create 800,000 jobs. There's only one problem. The jobs wouldn't be in America."" The Romney campaign quickly fired back. ""President Obama is at it again today with another dishonest attack meant to distract from his own record of failure,"" Romney campaign spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg told CNN. ""After spending three years pushing policies that drive jobs overseas and sending taxpayer money to foreign-owned companies, it's clear President Obama doesn't have a clue when it comes to job creation in America."" The U.S. corporate tax rate is the highest in the industrial world, which hurts the ability of American businesses to compete globally and to create jobs in the United States, she said. ""Mitt Romney has a comprehensive plan to reform the corporate tax code that will lower rates, get rid of incentives for firms to create jobs in other countries, and encourage the kind of economic growth President Obama has been unable to deliver,"" she added. The new back-and-forth came as both campaigns have repeatedly accused the opposing candidate of outsourcing U.S. jobs overseas. On another topic, Romney defended his release of his 2010 tax return and the promised release of his 2011 return as sufficient, despite calls from critics that he make public earlier returns. ""John McCain ran for president and released two years of tax returns,"" the former CEO of Bain Capital said of the 2008 GOP candidate. ""The Obama people keep on wanting more and more and more, more things to pick through, more things for their opposition research to try to make a mountain out of and to distort and to be dishonest about."" Frum: Romney's painfully bad week . That stance is largely consistent with Romney's position during his 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor. Romney's Democratic rival that year, Shannon O'Brien, released her tax information and called on Romney to do the same. Romney repeatedly declined. ""People who run for public office are exposed to extraordinary scrutiny, and that's as it should be, but there are some things that are not required for release, that are private, and I think my own income taxes, and my net worth and so forth are things I'd like to keep between myself and my family,"" Romney said in May 2002, according to the Boston Herald. His longtime strategist Eric Fehrnstrom cited the family's ""privacy"" and noted that state law did not require candidates to provide anything more than a financial disclosure form filed with the state Ethics Commission. On Sunday, Obama's senior campaign adviser David Axelrod told CNN's ""State of the Union"" such limited disclosure only raised more questions about Romney's finances. ""I can only conclude, with all these Republicans asking him to release these returns, that whatever is in those returns would be more damaging to his campaign than simply not releasing them,"" Axelrod said. Some Republicans began pushing Romney to release tax information over the weekend, saying it would be politically savvy to release the information to avoid a drawn-out fight with Democrats. ""He should release the tax returns tomorrow. It's crazy,"" conservative columnist Bill Kristol said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""You gotta release six, eight, 10 years of back tax returns. Take the hit for a day or two."" All of this, Romney said Monday, was a distraction from the real issues of the campaign. He said his own campaign was happy to compare itself with Obama's administration on transparency, citing the president's use of executive privilege to withhold documents related to the botched ""Fast and Furious""  program. ""The administration has shown a serious departure from the transparency from which they suggested we had,"" Romney said. ""And the American people should be calling for that kind transparency."" Families object to 9/11 Memorial's ban on politicians . GOP Sen. Rob Portman defended Romney against Obama's ""personal"" attacks, saying the Democrat was focusing on Romney because his own record falls short. Portman, speaking in Lebanon, Ohio, was holding an event for Romney roughly two hours ahead of Obama's own campaign speech in nearby Cincinnati. ""He's attacking Mitt Romney on a personal basis. Why? Because he doesn't want to talk about his record,"" the Republican from Ohio said. Portman is widely speculated to be a potential vice-presidential pick for Mitt Romney. Last week Portman said he met with Romney campaign staffers during three meetings while in Boston to headline a couple of fund-raisers for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But Portman, a former congressman and cabinet member in the George W. Bush administration, said the meetings were not at the Romney campaign headquarters, and had nothing to do with the vice presidential vetting process. On Monday, he refused to speculate on the vice presidential selection process, nor would he say whether Romney had made up his mind on his running mate. Portman added, ""People vote for the presidential candidate, not the vice president."" Another potential vice presidential pick said Monday he had spoken with the Romney aides involved in the search. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota told The Hill that he had traveled to Boston to meet with Beth Myers, who is leading Romney's search for a vice presidential pick, along with other senior advisers at the presumptive GOP nominee's headquarters. Thune would not say whether he was being formally vetted by Romney's team. Thune would provide geographic balance on a potential Republican ticket, though he would not offer a large degree of ideological disparity with the likely GOP nominee. Thune decided against making his own presidential bid in February 2011, but is considered a GOP hero for toppling incumbent Tom Daschle, then the top Democrat in the Senate, in 2004. Thune chairs the Senate Republican Conference, which controls the party's message in the Senate, and is often mentioned as a presidential contender down the road. Also Monday, Restore Our Future, the super PAC backing Romney, announced it had brought in $20 million in June. That marks a major jump from the prior month, when Restore Our Future reported bringing in $4.6 million. The spike was not a surprise, however, since the group received a $10 million donation from Nevada casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, in June. Also helping the group was the first donation from Foster Friess, a millionaire who backed the pro-Rick Santorum super PAC. He told CNN he gave a six-figure donation to Restore Our Future last month, though he refused to give the exact amount. Restore Our Future was active during the GOP primary, spending $38.9 million in the first three months of 2012. Much of its money went to campaign television commercials in support of Romney and critical of his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination.","Obama says he's seeking to restore ""the basic bargain"" that made America great .

"(CNN)Nico Rosberg took out the 2015 Mercedes on faster soft tires for the first time Friday and the result looks ominous for the team's rivals ahead of the new season. Last year's champion constructor had been content to allow world champion Lewis Hamilton and Rosberg rack up the laps on medium compound tires but in the afternoon session at the Circuit de Catalunya, the German star was given his head. He lapped in one minute 22.792 seconds, a full 0.7 seconds quicker than the next best of Felipe Massa in the Williams. It was also over a second better than his nearest rival on the day, Massa's teammate Valtteri Bottas of Finland. With the opening grand prix of the season in just over a fortnight in Australia, Mercedes has laid down the groundwork to repeat its 2014 triumphs where it won 16 of the 19 races. Not least because it has run for over 1,000 laps in the three pre-season tests at Jerez and Barcelona, which end Sunday. Red Bull -- with Daniel Ricciardo scoring three impressive wins -- was its closest rival but the Australian's best time set Thursday on soft tires was one minute 24.574, considerably off the Mercedes pace. Vettel boost . Ferrari, with Sebastian Vettel new to its ranks, has showed signs of improvement and the four-time world champion got a best of the day 143 laps under his belt. There was better news as well for the CNN-sponsored McLaren-Honda team which suffered a further setback when two-time world champion Fernando Alonso was hospitalized after a crash Sunday at the same circuit. The Spaniard left hospital Wednesday and has posted a YouTube message saying he was ""completely fine"" and would be taking his place on the grid for the season-opener in Melbourne. In his absence, teammate Jenson Button has been playing desperate catch up with their rivals on the grid. The 2009 world champion totaled 101 laps in the MP4-30, which has been plagued with teething problems, but the session ended on a low note when it stopped on the track to cause a red flag. Force India also finally unveiled its VJM08 car for the new campaign and Nico Hulkenberg managed 76 laps. Marussia to return? In other F1 news, Manor Marussia has been included on the official entry list for the new season. Financially-troubled Marussia came out of administration this month after failing to take part in the final three races of last season when its cash ran out. It was also still reeling from the horrific crash of its star driver Jules Bianchi at the Japanese Grand Prix. England's Will Stevens has been confirmed as its first driver and is set to take his place on the grid at Albert Park on March 15. Stevens raced in last season's final race in Abu Dhabi for Caterham, another struggling team, which has been scrapped from the 2015 list after failing to find new funding.","Nico Rosberg sets fastest time in F1 testing near Barcelona .

The FBI engaged in an undercover operation, with the help of a person who began cooperating in exchange for favorable treatment on his criminal exposure on an unrelated case. Cornell allegedly told that source he had been in contact with persons overseas, and that he had aligned himself with ISIS. He did not think he would receive ""specific authorization to conduct a terrorist attack in the United States, but stated that he wanted to go forward with violent jihad and opined that this would be their way of supporting ISIL,"" the complaint said, using another name for ISIS. According to the complaint, Cornell wrote: ""I believe that we should just wage jihad under our own orders and plan attacks and everything ... I believe we should meet up and make our own group in alliance with the Islamic State here and plan operations ourselves."" The anatomy of ISIS: How it is run . He was plotting, with the undercover FBI operative, to set off pipe bombs in the U.S. Capitol and shoot people as they fled, the complaint said. Cornell and the operative allegedly met in Cincinnati in October and again in November. He researched the targeted government buildings and the construction of pipe bombs, saved money for the attack and bought weapons and ammunition, the complaint said. Cornell was arrested Wednesday.

""He's such a loveable, kind person."" According to a law enforcement source, the plan posed no threat to lawmakers. But the complaint indicated that the plot was in its late stages.

"You can set your watch by it. Within minutes of the start of a State of the Union address, the President will offer his assessment -- almost always positive -- of where America stands. ""We can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger,"" President Barack Obama declared in the third paragraph of last year's speech. But why wait for him to tell us how things are going this year? And don't presidents always spin it to make it sound as good as possible for their administration? Instead, CNN asked its correspondents, producers, analysts and contributors to provide their assessment of the state of the Union as 2014 begins before Obama's speech on Tuesday night. Here's how they see it: . Economy -- for many, a slow recovery . CNNMoney's Annalyn Kurtz reports that economic recovery continues from the recession Obama inherited, but so far it seems that only the rich are getting richer. The presidency -- feeling feisty . CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta reports that Obama and his team plan to use executive orders to bypass legislative gridlock in their declared ""year of action."" Congress -- coming to life? Darrell West, the vice president for governance studies at the Brookings Institution, writes that political expediency in an election year may bring some congressional cooperation rather than continued partisan stalemate. The military -- under the budget gun . CNN's Tom Cohen reports there's no evident peace dividend for the U.S. military after ending the Iraq war and winding down combat operations in Afghanistan, due to budget cuts in Washington and a transition to a more modern armed forces. Foreign policy -- U.S. still a leader?

National security -- shifting post-9/11 posture .

"(CNN) -- If you're going to name your kid after a wild animal, at least have a good reason. Kate Winslet, who welcomed son Bear Blaze with husband Ned Rocknroll last December, has assured ""Ellen's"" Ellen DeGeneres that yes, there's a purpose for the kid's unique signature. Bear Blaze is the 38-year-old star's third child -- she had daughter Mia, 13, and son Joe, 10, with prior husbands Jim Threapleton and Sam Mendes, respectively -- and this time around she had baby names on the brain. ""When I was pregnant with Mia and I was pregnant with Joe, I didn't name them before they came out because I always felt like I just have to see them and see who they're going to be,"" Winslet said. ""But of course this time around, there's Mia and Joe and the whole pregnancy's about what are we going to call the baby. ... They were very much included, and we settled on Bear quite early on."" The reason she loved the name is because a friend of hers was nicknamed Bear, ""and I just had always really loved it,"" the ""Divergent"" actress said. ""He was very much a bear, he was everybody's shoulder to cry on, he was a big bear hug. He was just this great figure in my life."" And to pick Bear's middle name, she and her husband Ned wanted something that represented their bond. ""Bear's second name is Blaze because my husband and I met in a house fire basically,"" the actress continued, referring to the fire that consumed billionaire Richard Branson's Caribbean home while she was staying there in 2011. ""The house burnt down and we survived, but we wanted something of the fire, and so Blaze was the name that we came up with."" Bear Blaze may be uncommon, but Winslet didn't want to be creative with the infant's last name. While her husband enjoys the last name Rocknroll, an eccentric moniker he adopted before he met and married the actress, it's pretty clear she doesn't like it. When DeGeneres asked why Winslet's youngest son isn't taking his father's last name, she paused before responding with a laugh, ""Why do you think, Ellen?"" Instead, he'll be known as Bear Blaze Winslet.","Kate Winslet chose a surprising name for her third child .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that she aims to ""renew America's leadership"" in a world that has undergone an ""extraordinary transformation"" since the end of the Cold War and is now facing ""great peril."" Sen. Hillary Clinton poses for pictures with Sens. John Kerry, right, and Dick Lugar, left. Speaking during her confirmation hearing for the position of secretary of state, she also called the current U.S. engagement in Afghanistan the ""greatest priority for the president-elect."" Clinton completed her testimony on Tuesday. The committee is expected to vote on her nomination on Thursday. The full Senate is expected to approve Clinton's nomination before Obama takes office next Tuesday. The chairman of the committee -- Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts -- closed the hearing by saying ""we are excited about the prospect of working with you."" During her testimony Clinton pledged to help end the war in Iraq by safely withdrawing American troops and said the Obama administration is ""not taking any option off the table at all"" when it comes to dealing with Iran, but will pursue a new and ""perhaps different"" approach characterized by an ""attitude toward engagement."" Her ""overriding duty,"" Clinton said, would be to protect America's interests through the use of ""smart power"" that utilizes all facets at the nation's disposal.  Watch highlights from the hearing » . The New York senator and former presidential candidate asserted that, for too long, U.S. policymakers have been locked in a false ""either-or"" paradigm forcing a choice between the use of military force and diplomacy. Military power should still be used, she emphasized, but only as a last resort.  Watch Clinton talk about defense and diplomacy » . Clinton said the State Department was underutilized in recent years, and will be ""firing on all cylinders"" if she is confirmed. She promised to use ""diplomacy, development and defense"" to work with allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan, which she referred to as ""the central front in the war on terrorism."" President-elect Barack Obama will pursue a ""more for more"" strategy in Afghanistan, wherein additional U.S. support will be supplemented by more NATO and Afghan government support, she said. Clinton also emphasized the need to look at the problems in Pakistan and Afghanistan together, and said it is ""imperative"" to work with both of them. On Iraq, she called the withdrawal of U.S. troops a ""primary priority"" and said it would occur within the context of the current Status of Forces Agreement. She said the Obama administration hopes to remove U.S. troops from Iraqi cities and villages by June 2009, and redeploy some of those troops to Afghanistan. She also pledged to use every tool at her disposal to try to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, which she termed an ""unacceptable"" outcome. ""Our goal will be to do everything we can through diplomacy and the use of greater sanctions,"" she said.  Watch Clinton call for a bipartisan foreign policy » . ""It's hard to predict how successful we will be,"" Clinton admitted. But she emphasized that the Obama administration will work to boost international support for measures that would dissuade Iran from pursuing a nuclear military capability, and would ""act in concert"" with American allies in the region, including Israel. Turning her attention to the recent eruption of violence in Gaza, Clinton said that ""as intractable as the Middle East problems may seem ... we cannot give up on peace.""  Watch Clinton's entire opening statement » . She emphasized, however, that the United States ""cannot negotiate with Hamas"" until the group recognizes Israel, renounces violence and pledges to abide by past agreements. ""That is just ... an absolute for me,"" Clinton said. ""That is the United States' position and the president-elect's position."" ""The president-elect and I understand and are deeply sympathetic to Israel's desire to defend itself under the current conditions and to be free of shelling by Hamas rockets,"" she noted. ""However, we have also been reminded of the tragic humanitarian costs of conflict in the Middle East and pained by the suffering of Palestinian and Israeli civilians."" Clinton stated that the recent violence in Gaza ""must only increase our determination to seek a just and lasting peace agreement that brings real security to Israel, normal and positive relations with its neighbors, and independence, economic progress and security to the Palestinians in their own state."" Later, as the committee adjourned for an early afternoon break, six Code Pink protesters screamed, ""What about Gaza? We need your voice, Hillary."" The protesters held up pink signs that said ""Ceasefire in Gaza."" The biggest danger to U.S. security, Clinton emphasized, is that weapons of mass destruction will fall into the hands of terrorists. For that reason, she asserted, she favors a ""tough, reality-based approach to North Korea"" as the best way to minimize or eliminate the regime's role as a proliferator of deadly weapons and nuclear technology. While Clinton supports the six-party talks as ""a vehicle for us to exert pressure on North Korea in a way that is more likely to alter their behavior,"" she also said that she is under ""no illusions"" about the scope of the challenge presented by the rogue regime. She indicated that the entire ""record of negotiation [with North Korea] up to this date"" is under review. Clinton also stated, however, that the talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear program provided a unique opportunity for bilateral contact between the United States and a regime once labeled by President Bush as part of the ""axis of evil."" Responding to a question from California Sen. Barbara Boxer about the trafficking and imprisonment of sex slaves, Clinton said she views issues relating to women's rights as ""central"" to American foreign policy. ""We cannot have a free, prosperous [and] progressive world if women are treated in a ... discriminatory, violent way,"" Clinton argued. She pledged to do everything possible to eliminate ""a slavery of girls and women"" that exists in forms ranging from a disparity in wages to captivity in brothels. As the hearing opened, committee chairman Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, called Clinton an ""alliance builder"" who has ""earned the respect of her colleagues"" and could help overcome ""the polarization of the last eight years."" Confirming her as the next secretary of state, he said, would send the international community a ""strong signal immediately that America is back."" Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, the committee's ranking Republican, said that Obama, by tapping Clinton, had chosen ""the epitome of a big leaguer"" who could ""bolster efforts to improve foreign attitudes towards the United States."" Asked how Clinton had performed at the morning hearing, Lugar responded:  ""She did well."" But both Kerry and Lugar noted the need for Clinton to address questions relating to the fundraising activities of her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Confirmation hearings for education secretary nominee Arne Duncan, housing and urban development secretary nominee Shaun Donovan, and energy secretary nominee Steven Chu were also held on Tuesday.","Hillary Clinton says protecting U.S. interests would be her ""overriding duty""

"Ahead of annual, routine military exercises between South Korea and the United States, North Korea issued its usual caustic objections Saturday. It threatened ""miserable destruction,"" if ""your side ignites a war of aggression by staging the reckless joint military exercises ... at this dangerous time."" Though customary, the stark posturing by North Korea stands in the shadow of an underground nuclear test two weeks ago that was preceded by the launch of a long-range missile capable of transporting a warhead. The detonation of the nuclear charge was the third in Pyongyang's history and the first under supreme leader Kim Jong Un's rule. South Korea's military reacted with fierce military drills, including a public display of newly deployed cruise missiles with pinpoint accuracy. It has been on heightened readiness ever since. The test also triggered a global wave of condemnation, including from Beijing, and plans for new sanctions against Pyongyang. North Korea issued the objections to exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle scheduled for March and April to U.S. commander James D. Sherman, state run news agency KCNA reported. The message was delivered over the phone in English, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. It also condemned the threat of new sanctions over North Korea's recent actions. A United Nations military commission informed Pyongyang of the upcoming routine exercises, according to a joint statement from U.S. and South Korean military officials. The commission also told North Korea that they are ""not related with the current situations on the Korean Peninsula."" Around 10,000 U.S. forces will participate in Foal Eagle from March 1 to April 30.  Key Resolve will involve 10,000 South Korean troops and 3,500 U.S. troops in exercises March 11 to 21.

"Over her long lifetime, Lily Montejo has seen the city of Tacloban shaken by war, earthquakes and powerful typhoons. But nothing she can remember from the past eight decades comes close, she says, to the terror unleashed this month by Super Typhoon Haiyan. ""I really thought it was already the apocalypse -- that I wasn't going to survive,"" she says, shaking her head at a table in her family's storm-damaged home. For a lot of residents of Tacloban and the surrounding area, the extraordinarily strong typhoon was the end. The death toll stands at slightly over 4,000 -- more than three-quarters of them in the province of Leyte, of which Tacloban is the capital. Thousands more are injured. And many survivors have lost family members and their homes. The scale of the devastation has prompted some to look back into history to try to figure out how unusual Haiyan was. Meteorologists rate it as one of the most powerful storms to hit land anywhere in the world. Worse than war . Montejo, who is older than 80 but coyly asks that her exact age not be published, says she remembers plenty of typhoons striking this storm-prone region, some of them with deadly results. But she says she ""never experienced"" anything like Haiyan, which is known as Yolanda in the Philippines. She says she can remember World War II, during which Gen. Douglas MacArthur waded ashore at Red Beach, not far south of Tacloban, in 1944. He was leading U.S. troops in the campaign that liberated the Philippines from the Imperial Japanese Army. For a young girl, as Montejo was at the time, the war ""was a picnic,"" she says. There was no school, and adults were distracted much of the time. During bombing raids, Montejo says, her family would hide in holes her father had dug under the house. The ferocious winds and devastating storm surge of Haiyan were far more terrifying than the wartime planes, she says. In fact, nothing comparable to the super typhoon appears to have ravaged Leyte in more than a century. 'Great loss of life' in 1912 . But in November 1912, a powerful storm was reported to have caused widespread devastation in the region. News reports from the time are eerily reminiscent of coverage of Haiyan's impact today. Tacloban ""was almost entirely destroyed with great loss of life,"" reads a report in The Washington Times of November 29, 1912 -- a time when the Philippines were under U.S. control. The exact death toll from that typhoon was unclear. An article in The Washington Herald on November 30 suggested that ""probably"" half the population of Tacloban and another city, Capiz, had been lost. It put the population of Tacloban at 12,000 and that of Capiz at more than 20,000. But a report on the same day in The New York Times put the provisional death toll far lower, at slightly more than 300. But the newspaper acknowledged that damaged telegraph lines meant ""no estimate is yet possible of the number of fatalities, or of the property losses."" See a panoramic photo of the devastation . 'A mass of ruins' in 1897 . A powerful storm also devastated the region at the end of the 19th century, striking the islands of Samar and Leyte with strong winds and a deadly ""tidal wave"" in a manner similar to Haiyan's. ""The hurricane reached Leyte and struck the capital of Tacloban with great fury,"" read the story in The New York Times on November 28, 1897. ""In less than half an hour the town was a mass of ruins."" Reports at the time estimated that the storm -- ""one of the worst disasters reported from the Southern Ocean in many years"" -- had killed more than 6,000 local residents and 400 Europeans. The storm struck the central Philippines in early October, but didn't register in the U.S. press until more than a month later, after a ship arrived in Hong Kong bringing ""letters and papers which contain accounts of the ravages of the tidal wave and the winds,"" reports said. Again, there is uncertainty over the precise death toll. In an article this week on the Philippines news site Rappler.com, the former government official Raphael Lotilla cites a study of the 1897 typhoon carried out at the time by officials from the Observatory of Manila. The study estimates the number of dead to be roughly 1,300, far fewer than U.S. newspapers reported. 'The one building that survived the storm' Pictures hint at hope . Looking beyond the death toll, Lotilla draws attention to pictures from the era that show communities and churches destroyed in Samar and Leyte -- just as they have been by Haiyan. ""For me, their most eloquent unspoken message for us today is one of hope,"" he writes. ""These communities did live again; and they will once more."" History suggests that Tacloban and other severely damaged communities will eventually recover, says Vicente Rafael, a professor specializing in Southeast Asian history at the University of Washington. ""I have no doubt,"" he says. ""If only because Tacloban has historically been at the crossroads of trade, commerce and tourism."" He says the government of President Benigno Aquino III, which has been in the spotlight over the response to the storm, ""is going to be very anxious to prove itself by rebuilding the city."" ""It's not going to be Haiti where several years later people are still living in tents,"" he says, referring to the devastating earthquake that struck the Caribbean nation in 2010. Jason Day loses eight relatives to Typhoon Haiyan . Daunting recovery . But in Tacloban, the road ahead appears dauntingly long. Workers are still clearing away bodies and debris. For many people left in the city, the immediate question remains one of survival. Hundreds of thousands of people remain homeless and reliant on emergency relief for food and water. Montejo is one of the city's more fortunate residents, even if she doesn't feel that way. A classmate of the famous former Philippines first lady, Imelda Marcos, Montejo married into one of Tacloban's most prominent families. (Her maiden name is Anover.) Her husband, who died last year, ran a number of businesses, including radio, newspapers and hospitality; one of her sons is a local congressman. Unlike most people's homes, the family's sturdily built multistory house in the center of town is still standing despite damage to its windows and roof. After the storm, it sheltered some of those whose homes were destroyed. The typhoon's howling winds nonetheless forced large amounts of water into the house, ruining photos albums, pictures and other family mementos. ""It will take years for us to get back to normal,"" she says. The grim task of recovering Tacloban's dead .","The super typhoon is the worst event Lily Montejo can remember in Tacloban .

"Madrid (CNN)Spain's former King Juan Carlos, 77, will face a paternity lawsuit -- by a Belgian woman alleging that he's her father -- before the nation's Supreme Court, a 12-judge panel ruled Wednesday. The court accepted the case for study, two court spokeswomen told CNN. The royal household affirmed its ""respect"" for judicial decisions but declined further comment. The plaintiff is Ingrid Sartiau, 48, who lives near Brussels. Sartiau alleges that her mother and the married Juan Carlos had a relationship in late 1965, and she was born, as a result, in August 1966, said her attorney, Jaume Pararols. He became Spain's King and head of state in 1975 after the death of the dictator Francisco Franco. Juan Carlos abdicated in June in favor of his son, King Felipe VI, who was born in 1968. While the court agreed to take Sartiau's claim for study, it rejected a separate paternity suit against the former King brought by a Spanish man. For a paternity claim to be accepted, a petitioner must submit documentation, such as a photo or a letter, offering evidence of a relationship that involved Juan Carlos, the court spokeswomen said. Sartiau's mother is alive and willing to testify, the lawyer, Pararols, told CNN by phone from his office in a town north of Barcelona. ""We would like to reach a settlement. My client never wanted it to get to this point,"" Pararols said. The plaintiff has asked the court to require a DNA test for the former King, who has 20 days to make an initial response to the lawsuit. Juan Carlos no longer has immunity from prosecution, but he has protection that permits cases against him to be heard only by the Supreme Court, which is Spain's second highest, after the Constitutional Court.","A court will study a paternity lawsuit brought against the former King of Spain .

"(CNN)The U.S. crew aboard the International Space Station relocated from its quarters after what turned out to be a false alarm on Wednesday, NASA said. A possible ammonia leak in the cooling system had the crew from the American segment of the station move temporarily to the Russian segment. It was a false alarm, NASA said. Tests indicated that the off-scale measurements were the result of a computer failure, and not an ammonia leak. International Space Station program manager Mike Suffredini said the relocation was done as a precaution because of four measurements that were off scale. These measures could have indicated an ammonia leak. The astronauts, as trained, put on masks, moved to the Russian segment, and closed the hatch to the American segment, he said. Two U.S. astronauts are aboard the International Space Station: commander Barry Wilmore and flight engineer Terry Virts. Once it was determined that the emergency was a false alarm, the astronauts still had to wait while equipment on the U.S. segment was powered back up, Suffredini said. NASA tweeted that at 3:05 p.m. ET, the hatch was reopened and the astronauts returned. There was no ammonia in the area, NASA said. The crew was unable to carry out experiments that were planned, but no research was lost, Suffredini said. The Americans were joined by Samantha Cristoforetti, a flight engineer with the European Space Agency, and others in the space station's six-member crew. ""Hey everybody, thanks for your concern,"" Cristoforetti tweeted. ""We're all safe & doing well in the Russian segment.""

"(CNN)Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso was airlifted to hospital after crashing his McLaren-Honda in the final day of pre-season testing in Barcelona Sunday. Spain's Alonso was on his 21st lap at the Circuit de Catalunya when his car left the track at Turn 3 and hit a wall at about 150kph per hour. With the morning session immediately red-flagged, Alonso received urgent medical attention, with a screen placed around the accident scene. A statement from McLaren later gave an update on the condition of the 33-year-old Alonso. ""He was conscious and spoke with the doctors. However, as per usual procedure in such circumstances, he was then airlifted to hospital where he is undergoing precautionary checks,"" it read. Alonso's agent Luis Garcia Abad told AFP that he would likely remain in hospital under observation for at least 24 hours. It was another setback for McLaren and its new MP4-30 car, which has been plagued by problems, with Jenson Button having to cut short his test session Saturday. Button was due to take over from Alonso for the afternoon runs, but the Briton had to sit it out. With new season set to start on March 15 in Australia, the team has only a further four-day test at the same venue later this week to sort out its problems . Alonso, who left Ferrari to join McLaren at the end of last season, has 32 career F1 wins but his two title wins date back to the 2005 and 2006 seasons. Alonso's fellow Spaniard, rookie Carlos Sainz Junior, was fastest in the session in his Toro Rosso in a time of one minute 25.604 seconds, running on fast super-soft tires. The afternoon session gave more clues as to the readiness of teams for the season-opener with Romain Grosjean setting the fastest time of the week of one minute 24.067 second in his Lotus, again on super-softs. Last year's all-conquering Mercedes also had good reason to be satisfied with Nico Rosberg completing over 100 laps, with his best effort the second-best of the four-day test, despite running on slower medium compound tires. Thursday will see F1 teams return to the circuit for the last official testing before Australia.","Fernando Alonso crashes in final day of testing at Circuit de Catalunya .

"In the pink-hued streets of Toulouse, France's ""Ville Rose,"" flags are flying at half-mast: The city is in mourning -- and shock. In just over a week, three brutal shootings have left seven people -- including three young children -- dead, and two more fighting for their lives. The attacks, two targeting soldiers from ethnic minorities, and the third focused on a Jewish school, have stunned the country, and left local residents dreading the gunman's next move. ""There is a lot of fear,"" said Jean Cohadon, crime reporter on the Dépêche du Midi newspaper. ""He has killed three times already, with more victims each time, and people are asking 'What will he do tomorrow?'"" Toulouse, a pretty city on the banks of the Garonne river in southwestern France, is best known for its historic old town, universities, churches and galleries, and for being home to aircraft manufacturer Airbus. With a huge student population, and workers drawn from across the world to work in companies linked to the aerospace industry, the city is proudly international. ""I've always felt very safe here,"" one Jewish-American resident, who asked not to be named, told CNN. ""We love the city. It is a charming place, like a village within a city, really, very quaint. ""We are just shell-shocked by what has happened. We can't believe it -- it seems so surreal."" The drama began nine days ago, with the shooting of an off-duty soldier in Toulouse. But at first, Cohadon says, no one could imagine the horrors to come. ""The first death was not unnoticed, but no one had any idea of what was behind it -- the soldier was not in uniform, and it seemed like an isolated incident,"" he told CNN. Then last Thursday three members of a local parachute regiment were gunned down in Montauban, 30 miles away. Two of the men died; the third remains critically ill. Police soon linked the two attacks, which involved soldiers from North African and Caribbean backgrounds, and which were carried out with the same weapon, by a gunman who fled on a scooter. ""That led to questions about the motivation behind the attack,"" said Cohadon. ""Why were soldiers targeted? Why members of a parachute regiment? Was there a link to our operations in Afghanistan?"" With the third attack, on the Ozar Hatorah School in Toulouse on Monday, things became, Cohadon says, ""even more troubling."" ""Here we have four deaths, of whom three were children, little children, just three, six and eight. The attack seems predetermined, very violent -- the gunman is said to have shot at everything that moved, and again he made his getaway on a scooter."" Again, the shooting has left local residents questioning the attacker's motive -- and what else he may be capable of. ""Is the motive simply racist? Is it someone who is attacking minorities? Or is it a terrorist attack?"" said Cohadon. ""And if he was capable of killing three times, in such a way, what happens next time?"" Security has been beefed up across the city -- and at religious sites around the country -- and anti-terrorism police from Paris have been brought in to oversee the investigation, a sign that the killings are officially considered an act of terrorism, but the gunman remains at large. ""There is a lot of concern that no one has been apprehended yet -- that's the big issue for everyone: Is this person going to be found?"" says the U.S. expat, a member of the Americans in Toulouse group. ""But walking around the city, you wouldn't necessarily know about it -- the streets are still bustling."" City authorities have canceled the annual carnival, which was to have taken place this week, both out of respect for the victims and their families, and because of concerns over safety. ""It's an amazing statement from the city to say 'There's no way we can celebrate,'"" said the U.S. expat. It seems unlikely that the city's residents will feel like celebrating anything until the killer is caught and brought to justice -- until then, Cohadon says, a mood of ""worry and incomprehension"" will continue to hang over the town.","City of Toulouse on high alert after three deadly shootings in just over a week .

"It was a rare show of bipartisanship -- President Barack Obama, flanked by Democrats and Republicans in April, signing into law a bill that would ban insider trading on Capitol Hill. The measure, known as the STOCK Act, had passed the House and Senate at warp speed. ""The powerful shouldn't get to create one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else,"" the president said at the time. Lawmakers proclaimed that the bill, officially called the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, would restore trust in government. It also applied new rules to some employees of the executive branch. GSA: $250K spent on one-day event . But CNN uncovered that the law that members of Congress thought they voted for earlier this year isn't exactly as advertised. A loophole could still allow family members of some lawmakers to profit from inside information. The STOCK Act requires that any trades of $1,000 or more made on or after July 3 have to be reported to the House and Senate within 45 days. But the House and Senate have two completely different interpretations of that rule. In the Senate, the Ethics Committee released one page of guidelines last month ruling that members and their spouses and dependent children all have to file reports after they make stock or securities trades. But the House Ethics Committee disagreed. Its 14-page memo notifies House members and aides covered by the law that their spouses and children aren't covered. The Office of Government Ethics, which oversees all federal executive branch employees, sided with the House, informing its employees that their spouses and children don't need to file these periodic reports. Both of the lead sponsors of the Senate bill didn't realize the discrepancy until CNN brought it to their attention. Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown, the only Republican senator to attend the White House signing ceremony, said he was ""obviously very concerned."" ""Say I find out some information, I tell my wife and she goes and trades on it, what's the difference?"" Brown told CNN. Brown, who speaks constantly about this bill in his neck-and-neck race for re-election against consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren, said the whole point of passing the law was to demonstrate that members of Congress weren't held to a different standard. ""I mean, bottom line, we're supposed to have that level of transparency and have us be treated like every other member of the United States and bottom line, if we can't do it, then -- sorry, if they can't do it -- then we shouldn't be able to do it as well."" Why won't Romney release more tax documents? Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, also criticized the House decision not to include congressional spouses and children. ""I think it's wrong, and I think it's unfortunate because the reality is the whole point of this legislation is we should play by the exact same rules as every other American citizen, and when all of America looks at Washington, they know it's broken."" ""We're trying to restore just a small measure of confidence through this kind of transparency and accountability,"" Gillibrand said. After CNN told Brown about the House interpretation, Brown fired off a letter to his GOP colleagues in the House, Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. ""The House interpretation leaves a loophole and the appearance of an ongoing double standard,"" Brown said in the letter. ""It is deeply troubling that the House of Representatives and Executive Branch would attempt to operate under a substantially weaker interpretation than the Senate,"" he added, demanding that the House adopt the Senate's view and require all spouses and dependents to begin reporting stock trades. Chances for an Anthony Weiner comeback . Why the difference? Robert Walker, a Washington ethics attorney and former chief counsel for both the House and Senate Ethics Committees, explained that the Senate bill did include a provision that covered spouses and children, but when Cantor's office wrote the House version, this language was shifted to a different section of the bill. The change meant that spouses and dependent children weren't subject to the new reporting requirements. ""The House recrafted some of the provisions of it and moved some of the provisions around. In that process, some of the Senate bill that applied to filing of these new reports was moved from one section of the bill to the other,"" Walker said. The Senate Ethics Committee decided to stick with the spirit of the law that senators originally intended, but the House Ethics Committee went with the letter of the law, which included the loophole not requiring spouses and children to report financial transactions in a timely fashion. GOP senators block Obama job initiative . Why does it matter? This so-called ""loophole"" goes to the heart of what the STOCK Act set out to do. While there were already laws in place barring members of Congress or the executive branch from profiting from nonpublic information that they learn in the course of their duties, it was extremely difficult for those at the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce those laws. The financial disclosure forms House members and senators were already required to file only come out once a year, making it tough to track any relationship between legislative action and a stock trade. That's why the STOCK Act added the rule that after each trade over $1,000 a report had to be filed in a timely manner. Walker stressed the new law provides ""more immediacy, more real time so that the public could have more real-time understanding of what their members, of their senior staff and other high government officials were doing with their finances, what kinds of trades were they making."" The chairman of the House Ethics Committee, Rep. Jo Bonner, R-Alabama, and the ranking Democrat, U.S. Rep. Linda Sanchez of California, defended their committee's interpretation of the law in a written statement to CNN. ""As has been noted by outside experts, the office of Government Ethics and various House offices of expertise, including the Office of Legislative Counsel and the Office of General Counsel, with whom the Committee consulted, the plain language of the STOCK Act and the Ethics in Government Act is unambiguous and beyond dispute and the Committee interpreted it correctly."" Congressional dysfunction: Who's to blame? Initially when contacted by CNN, Cantor's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act. But when pressed with the new information uncovered by CNN, the majority leader's office conceded it made changes to the House bill that effectively took out the requirement for spouses and children to file these reports. Cantor's spokesman maintains the change was inadvertent, but told CNN because of our reporting, they're now promising to remedy the problem. ""It was not the intention of the House to differ with the Senate-passed bill with respect to application to spouses and dependent children. We did not believe at the time that we had differed from what the Senate had done,"" spokesman Doug Heye told CNN. Heye said after learning from CNN about the difference, they are now looking at ways to fix it. ""Since new information has been brought to our attention with respect to this discrepancy, we are reviewing our options regarding transaction reports in the House of Representatives."" Still, another question is why the House changed the legislation in the first place. A GOP leadership source insists there were no sinister motives, that Cantor and the broader GOP leadership made changes after consulting with Ethics Committee lawyers. How they will correct it remains to be seen, but the GOP source says however it's done, it will be made clear spouses and children of House members and their top aides, as well as the executive branch all carry out the law the way Senate sponsors intended.","STOCK Act bans members of Congress from insider trading .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The detection of high levels of radioactivity in certain Japanese foods -- and the nation's subsequent clampdown on their sales -- signals the food safety situation is ""more serious"" than originally thought, a World Health Organization official said Monday. Peter Cordingley, the Manila-based spokesman for the WHO's regional office for the Western Pacific, said his organization believes people in Japan ""have to be cautious"" about what they eat and drink. Besides causing devastation throughout northeast Japan, the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on March 11 seriously damaged several reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, leading to the release of an unspecified amount of radioactive material into the atmosphere. On Sunday, the sale of raw milk from Fukushima Prefecture and spinach from  neighboring Ibaraki Prefecture were banned due to detected levels of radioactive iodine and cesium that surpassed  government limits, Japan's health ministry reported. And officials in  Fukushima halted the distribution of locally grown vegetables outside  the prefecture. Cordingley noted that, whereas fears initially were for produce within 30 kilometers (18 miles) of the plant, cows (and the milk they produce) outside that radius and spinach from as far as 120 kilometers was being affected. ""Quite clearly, it is not what we thought in the early stages. It is more serious,"" he said. ""We have seen Japanese people in grocery stores paying close attention to where their produce is coming from, and we think this is a wise practice."" Cordingley's assessment -- and the Japanese health ministry's move -- suggests that top world and national health agencies are definitely taking the issue seriously. And so are people in Japan. ""It doesn't look like a short-term issue,"" said Phil Knall, who lives in Tokyo. ""I'm definitely concerned about the food that is going to be shipped out from now. I'm definitely thinking about it."" Japanese officials reported levels of radioactive iodine in milk from  four locations in Fukushima that ranged from about 20% over the  acceptable limit to more than 17 times that limit. Testing at one  location also found levels of cesium about 5% over the acceptable limit,  the health ministry reported Sunday. And in Ibaraki, a  major center of vegetable production, tests at 10 locations found  iodine levels in spinach that ranged from 5% over acceptable limits to  more than 27 times that ceiling. At seven sites, levels of cesium grew  from just above 4% to nearly four times the limit. Iodine and cesium isotopes are byproducts of nuclear reactors like  the ones that were damaged in the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that  devastated the northern Japanese island of Honshu. While Iodine-131 has a  radioactive half-life of eight days, cesium-137's half-life is about 30  years. A  few water samples taken in the area tested positive for iodine --  although far below levels of concern under Japanese law, according to  the International Atomic Energy Agency website. The agency said it  received reports from Japan's government that six out of 46 samples  tested positive for the iodine-131 radioactive isotope. The decision to prohibit food produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast Japan hit by the earthquake, tsunami and other potential fall-out from the Fukushima  plant. Fukushima,  northeast of Tokyo, has Japan's fourth-largest  amount of farmland and  ranks among its top producer of fruits,  vegetables and rice.  Ibaraki, south of Fukushima, supplies Tokyo with a  significant amount of  fruits and vegetables and is Japan's  third-largest pork producer. After the 1986 nuclear plant disaster in Chernobyl  -- then a part of the Soviet Union --  tons of food had to be destroyed when  radioactive debris fell on crops in large swaths of Eastern Europe and  Scandinavia. Hygiene expert Satoshi Takaya, who helped  Japanese scientists prevent contaminated food from entering the country  at that time, said the current situation is no Chernobyl -- but he said  the current crisis is sure to affect Japanese farmers. That means threatening the livelihood of people like Ukia Uchida, an 82-year-old woman whose family has farmed a plot in Shibayama for generations. ""Up until now, I thought everything was fine here,"" said Uchida. ""But to hear that some radiation has been found here is pretty upsetting."" CNN's Jo Kent, Catherine E. Shoichet, Steven Jiang, Martin Savidge, Paul Ferguson, Thom Patterson and Matt Smith contributed to this report .","A WHO official calls the food safety situation ""more serious"" than first thought .

"(CNN) -- I strongly support Brittany Maynard's impassioned efforts to expand everyone's access to physician-assisted suicide. It is tragic that she died so young, but her life has made an important contribution to us all. I am an adamant opponent of physicians ever becoming agents of death. The lessons of the Holocaust, which began with a euthanasia program, are that once medical professionals become accustomed to administering death, we have created a frightening corps of people whose very ""medical"" prestige facilitates mass killing of the vulnerable. Hence I oppose physician involvement in capital punishment (via lethal injection) and all forms of euthanasia in which physicians are actively involved. But physicians are not actively involved in physician-assisted suicide. In jurisdictions where physician-assisted suicide is permitted and where proper safeguards are in place to prevent depressed or otherwise ineligible people from access to lethal drugs, physicians play a standard medical role of ascertaining applicants' eligibility for the appropriate medications. Then the physicians get out of the way. It may seem strange to say this, but the reason that you and I as free individuals cannot access life-ending drugs is because governments have imposed rules that require prescription approval by physicians for such drugs. Hence, it is governments, and doctors acting on their behalf, who normally -- and wisely -- block our access to dangerous medications. Maynard's mourners grieve on social media . Where physician-assisted suicide is allowed, physicians withdraw from this role -- they stop blocking our free access to the drugs we need to end our life. They are not administering death by writing a prescription. Just the opposite, they get out of our way as free people and allow us to do what we want to do. Physicians cease their active blocking role and literally do nothing. We are the ones who act to end our lives. I feel this is appropriate. In addition, I believe that people who are facing the end of life -- terminally ill patients such as Maynard -- and those suffering grievous and irreversible pain should be free to end their life. This is a simple expression of respect for human freedom, autonomy and dignity, and it is also an expression of compassion to allow them to do it. Experience with physician-assisted suicide has shown that many people who go through the process of applying for it do not finally avail themselves of the right to do so. This tells us that physician-assisted suicide plays an important role in providing comfort and assurance that one will not be forced to suffer beyond what one can bear. There are many who, on religious or other grounds, oppose suicide in any form. I respect their beliefs, and I would defend their right to refuse to end their lives by their own hand. But mutual respect here also requires that we allow others who believe differently to end their lives in the way they see fit, as Brittany Maynard has now courageously done.","Brittany Maynard, 29, who had cancer, ended her life under Oregon's Death With Dignity Act .

"Author Stephen Covey, whose ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" sold more than 20 million copies, died Monday at Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. He was 79. Covey's family issued a statement, reported by CNN affiliate KSL, saying he died from residual effects of an April bicycle accident. ""In his final hours, he was surrounded by his loving wife and each one (of) his children and their spouses, just as he always wanted,"" the statement said, according to KSL. Covey was ""one of the world's foremost leadership authorities, organizational experts and thought leaders,"" according to a biography posted on the website of his 2011 book, ""The 3rd Alternative."" Other best-sellers by Covey include ""First Things First,"" ""Principle-Centered Leadership,"" and ""The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness,"" according to the biography. ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" has been named one of the most influential management books by several organizations, including Time and Forbes magazines. The audio book is the best-selling nonfiction audio in history, according to the website. Named in 1996 as one of Time magazine's 25 most influential Americans, according to the biography, Covey ""made teaching principle-centered living and principle-centered leadership his life's work."" Utah Gov. Gary Herbert released a statement saying he was ""saddened"" to hear of the death of Covey, a ""good friend.""

"Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- By all accounts, Michael Burdell was a gentle soul with a soft spot for people in need. A Vietnam veteran, he was issued a weapon but refused to carry it, serving as a technician on communications equipment, his fiancée, Donna Nu, said in court documents. The two had known each other for six years. Had Burdell, a 36-year-old attorney, not died on April 2, 1985, shot to death by Ronnie Lee Gardner during Gardner's escape attempt at a Salt Lake City courthouse, they would have been married. But Nu, along with Burdell's friend, Ron Temu, and his 86-year-old father, Joseph Burdell, are now arguing on Gardner's behalf. Gardner is to face a Utah firing squad on June 18. But driven by Burdell's pacifism and opposition to the death penalty, the three have filed statements in the case seeking to have his sentence commuted. ""Michael Burdell would not have wanted Ronnie Lee Gardner put to death,"" Nu said in court documents. ""There is absolutely no question about this in my mind."" Legal maneuvers aimed at delaying or avoiding Gardner's execution have accelerated. His defense attorneys went before the Utah Supreme Court this week to argue that he should receive a new sentencing hearing, appealing an earlier state court's denial. The justices took the case under advisement. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell denied a defense request to stop Thursday's commutation hearing before the state Board of Pardons and Parole. Defense attorney Andrew Parnes had asked Campbell to issue a temporary restraining order, saying he was concerned the hearing would not be fair and impartial because representatives from the Utah attorney general's office were both presenting the state's case at the hearing and advising the board. Attorneys representing the state agency said safeguards were in place to prevent a conflict of interest. Parnes also said he was concerned the board would not allow some videotaped testimony to be played at the hearing, although the board said it would take the testimony under consideration. He has filed a federal complaint over the matter, which he said was not necessarily nullified by Campbell's decision to let the hearing go forward. Nu will be among those testifying on Gardner's behalf. The elder Burdell, who lives in North Carolina, said in his statement he would be there as well, if his age did not preclude his traveling to Utah. Attempts by CNN to speak with Nu on Wednesday were unsuccessful, because she was traveling to Salt Lake City from her Arizona home. Temu did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The two are members of a Salt Lake City-based religious movement called Summum. Burdell was also a member. Summum was founded in 1975 by the late Corky Ra, also known as Summum Bonum Amon Ra, after he said he was visited by other beings. Belief blog: What is Summum? Nu said in her statement she met Burdell while the two were living in Arizona and she was making frequent trips to the Summum center in Utah. She introduced Burdell to the movement, and he became a member. They moved to Salt Lake City in 1982. ""In addition to Michael's personal beliefs, the Summum faith opposes capital punishment,"" Nu said in court documents. ""People who take the vows of Summum must pledge never to take the life of another person. Michael Burdell freely took this pledge."" Temu said in his statement he believes Burdell must have been ""the poorest attorney on Earth, because he so often represented people who could not afford to pay him."" Burdell lived ""like a monk,"" he said, and had few possessions. On April 2, 1985, Burdell was at the courthouse on a case, representing a fellow Vietnam veteran at no cost. Gardner was also at the courthouse that day, scheduled for a pretrial hearing in the 1984 slaying of Melvyn Otterstrom. He killed Otterstrom after escaping from prison; now, he was planning to escape from custody again. According to court documents filed by Gardner's defense, he had planned to use a gun that would be left hanging from a water fountain in the basement of the courthouse. However, an accomplice in the basement handed Gardner a .22-caliber gun instead as he was being led in by guards. Gardner was handcuffed, and his legs chained together. His arms also were fastened to a waist chain that limited how far he could raise his hands. As soon as Gardner was given the gun, court documents said, he was shot and seriously injured by one of the guards with him. But he managed to ""shuffle"" into a basement office area, where courthouse archives were kept. Burdell and another attorney were in the office; they saw Gardner with a gun and hid behind the door as he came inside. As Gardner spotted them and pointed the gun at them, the other attorney fled, leaving Burdell behind. The other attorney reported hearing Burdell say, ""Oh, my God,"" and Gardner swear before the gun went off, shooting Burdell through the eye. Gardner then grabbed a corrections officer and tried to force him to accompany him out of the building, according to court documents. He also shot bailiff Nick Kirk as he was trying to leave. Gardner eventually surrendered to authorities on the courthouse lawn. He pleaded guilty in June 1985 to killing Otterstrom and was sentenced to life in prison, with a judge's recommendation that he not be released. Later that same year, he was convicted of capital murder in Burdell's death. Burdell's father said in court documents filed this year that he does not believe his son's shooting was premeditated. ""Gardner himself had been shot and his shooting my son was a spur-of-the-moment reaction,"" Joseph Burdell said. ""Furthermore,"" he added, ""I do not believe Gardner is the same person today that he was in 1985."" But Otterstrom's friends and family said they support Gardner's execution. Cousin Craig Watson told The Salt Lake Tribune this month, ""It's about time justice is served."" Kirk's widow also told the newspaper she supports the death penalty for Gardner, saying the shooting left her husband in constant pain. He was never the same, she said, and died of a heart attack in 1995. But those who loved Burdell recall his pacifist nature and his desire to help his fellow man. They believe that if Burdell were still alive, he would be campaigning against Gardner's death. ""My son was a caring and generous person who tried to help others,"" Joseph Burdell said. ""It would not have been in his nature to condone Gardner's execution. He would not have approved of it at all.""","Attorney Michael Burdell was shot to death at a Utah courthouse in 1985 .

"(CNN) -- With New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer's resignation, Lt. Gov. David Paterson will become the first African-American governor of the state and the fourth in U.S. history. David A. Paterson at the 2004 Pride Awards ceremony in June 2004. Paterson, 53, is legally blind, and although documentation is scarce, it is widely believed that he will be the nation's first blind governor. Paterson was first elected to the New York State Senate in 1985, where he represented the 30th District, encompassing Harlem, East Harlem and the Upper West Side. In November 2002, Paterson was elected New York Senate minority leader. He is the highest-ranking African-American elected official in New York state and is the first nonwhite legislative leader in Albany's history. He addressed the 2004 Democratic National Convention, as well as the U.S. Conference of Mayors that same year. Paterson was elected New York's first African-American lieutenant governor on November 7, 2006, on a ticket headed by Spitzer. As lieutenant governor, Paterson led the administration's charge in several areas, including stem cell research, alternative energy, domestic violence and the role of minority- and female-owned businesses. Paterson earned state and national attention for getting a 283-year-old burial ground of Colonial-era African-Americans in lower Manhattan designated a national historic landmark. Paterson is a leading advocate for the visually and physically impaired. His 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention marked the first time a visually impaired person addressed the convention. He is a member of the American Foundation for the Blind, serves as a member of the Democratic National Committee and is a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. According to the National Governors' Association, previous African-American governors were P.B.S. Pinchback, who served as acting governor of Louisiana for 36 days in 1872-73 while the sitting governor was being impeached; L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who became the nation's first elected black governor in 1990; and Deval Patrick, the current governor of Massachusetts. Paterson's father, Basil, was the first nonwhite secretary of state of New York and the first African-American vice chairman of the national Democratic Party. He lost a race for lieutenant governor in 1970 and was deputy mayor of New York City under Mayor Ed Koch, according to The New York Times. David Paterson earned his bachelor's degree in history from Columbia University and got his law degree from Hofstra Law School in 1982. He lives in Harlem with his wife, Michelle Paige Paterson, and their two children, Ashley and Alex. E-mail to a friend .","David A. Paterson is New York's first African-American lieutenant governor .

"In the midst of the struggle against Bashar al-Assad's government stands Jabhat al-Nusra, recently designated by the U.S. State Department as a foreign terrorist organization. A new report by the Quilliam Foundation in London says the organization is the most effective arm of the Syrian insurgency and now fields about 5,000 fighters against the Assad regime. Practically speaking, the terrorist designation means little that is new for the immediate struggle in Syria. Shortly after al-Nusra claimed credit for one of its early suicide bombings in January 2012, the Obama administration made known al-Nusra's connection to al Qaeda in Iraq, a group with which I was intimately familiar in my capacity as an analyst and targeting officer at the Central Intelligence Agency. The administration's position was reinforced when Director of National Intelligence James Clapper one month later testified in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""...we believe al-Qaeda in Iraq is extending its reach into Syria."" Analysis: Study shows rise of al Qaeda affiliate in Syria . Al-Nusra is filling a power vacuum through charitable efforts to galvanize local support and generating influence among Syrians.  In light of al-Nusra's influence in Syria, the real question is not so much about the scope and scale of al-Nusra currently, but rather how should the United States respond to its rise, particularly after al-Assad's eventual exit? Read more: Al-Assad touts plan for resolution, says enemies of Syria 'will go to hell' Historically, the U.S. government seemed to believe that as soon as people are given the chance, they will choose and then create a Jeffersonian democracy. Then we are surprised, if not outraged, that people turn to organizations such as Hamas, Hezbollah or the Muslim Brotherhood in electoral contests. These organizations often provide the basic necessities that people need to survive: food, water, medical care, education and security. As ideologically distasteful as we might find them, they are often doing things corrupt, weak or failing governments do not: providing the basic necessities that people need to survive (let alone create the conditions that enable people to aspire to thrive). Why does al-Nusra keep quiet about its ties to al Qaeda in Iraq? The documents pulled from the Abottabad raid that killed Osama bin Laden shed light on his awareness that the al Qaeda brand had been deteriorating. Read more: Appeals court to consider release of photos of bin Laden's body . Bin Laden urged regional groups, ""If asked, it would be better to say there is a relationship with al Qaeda, which is simply a brotherly Islamic connection, and nothing more,"" according to CNN.  Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had criticized the Jordanian-born founder and leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,  for his killing of civilians  and lack of political acumen to win public support. Talk about al Qaeda seems distant. It was a bogeyman made real in 1993 when it unsuccessfully attacked the World Trade Center and terrifyingly tangible in 2001 when its operatives succeeded in destroying the twin towers and expanded their attacks to the Pentagon and the air over Pennsylvania. Its looming shadow has since faded from the public eye, particularly with the death of  bin Laden.  Its vision and ideology, however, continue to have a strong appeal. Now that al Qaeda central has a less visible role, what makes players like al-Nusra and al Qaeda in Iraq threats? Even today, after  Zarqawi's death, al Qaeda in Iraq has managed to continue to wreak havoc in Iraq and in the region through an autonomous, adaptable structure. Read more: Senior al Qaeda leader killed in Pakistan, officials say . Al-Nusra has declared itself a player in the fight for a global jihad, a bold statement for what is today a localized group . Even small groups, however, have the potential to disrupt regional stability and complicate America's pursuit of its national security objectives—a fact I learned firsthand tracking and trying to stem the rise, influence and efficacy of al Qaeda in Iraq in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Zarqawi, until his death in 2006, was able to confound U.S. forces and attack Jordan by attracting recruits from North Africa (including Libya), Central Europe, Jordan and Syria. Some of Zarqawi's earliest recruits were veterans of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, an organization that  lashed out against the Syrian government during the 1980s.  Captured records from a raid near the city of Sinjar, Iraq, indicated that during the 2006-2007 time frame, 8% of al Qaeda in Iraq operatives were Syrians. The percentage likely ebbed and flowed as the group formed, became influential and waned, but it suggests that there was no shortage of recruits amenable to engage in religious conflict in Syria as recently as 5-10 years ago. Read more: What is the Muslim Brotherhood? The most striking thing about the captured records, however, is that it appears almost every foreign fighter entering Iraq to join al Qaeda in Iraq came through Syria. As a targeter, I can tell you that facilitation networks are key: they are the means by which groups such as al Qaeda in Iraq are funded, supplied and sustained. During the Iraq war, Zarqawi's top aides in Syria played a critical role in recruiting, funding and operational planning outside Iraq. Read more: Syrian minister: Enemies 'brainwashed' slain rebel son . One of the things U.S. officials and the international media should watch for is how al-Nusra uses its terrorist designation: If  it seeks to use the declaration to burnish its jihadist credentials, it might be able to bolster the image of the organization in the eyes of the extremist community and parlay that recognition into larger, or steadier, streams of funding—a development that will make the group more viable over the long-term or allow it to expand its operations or influence in the short- to mid-term. An important differentiator between al Qaeda in Iraq and al-Nusra is one of its tactics: Zarqawi made a practice of indiscriminately killing Iraqi civilians, effectively terrorizing the Iraqi population, especially the Shiite minority. Zarqawi, despite identifying with al Qaeda, had a much thinner theological basis than al Qaeda central. Key figures at al Qaeda central such as bin Laden and Zawahiri argued with Zarqawi over his tactics, complaining that alienating mainstream Muslims would not help achieve the over-arching goal of instilling Sharia law.

Al-Nusra is using some of the same tactics as al Qaeda in Iraq (e.g., suicide bombings, kidnappings and car bombs), but it appears to be trying to strike a balance Zarqawi was unwilling to make: Not only does it seem to be avoiding alienating—if not antagonizing—the larger population, but it also is providing the people of Syria with a range of goods and services such as food, water and medical care—basic necessities that people need to survive in the best of times, let alone when their country is in the throes of a civil war. If this becomes a trend, it might signal that al-Nusra aspires to be more like Hezbollah or Hamas, organizations that defy neat categorization based on the range of social, political and military activities they engage in and the resultant legitimacy they have in the eyes of their constituencies. Read more: Hamas leader unbending, but seeks Palestinian unity . In the Syrian uprising, the opportunity for meaningful U.S. intervention might have passed: Exhaustion from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have taken their toll on the U.S. military, have taxed the national treasury, and sapped political will, especially as the state of the economy remains at the center of the debate in Washington. Our absence from the fight is going to cost us if the al-Assad regime fails, leaving rebel groups like al-Nusra dictating the direction, pace and scope of a new Syria. Read more: Syrian rebel leader talks victory and squalor . Given that managing affairs in the Middle East has never been one of our strong suits, the question at this point should be how can the United States, particularly the Department of State, best engage groups that might be inimical to U.S. values but necessary to our interests in the Middle East? For that, I am not sure there is a clear or simple answer. One opportunity would be if the United States uses its designation of al-Nusra as both a stick and carrot, cajoling and encouraging it to enter into mainstream politics when (or if) the Assad regime falls. My read of al-Nusra, however, is that, like Zarqawi, it does not aspire to be a political player and is unlikely to settle for a political role in the new government.  Instead, it may aim to play the spoiler for any transitional government and use its resources and political violence to empower and encourage other like-minded extremists. With time and opportunity, al-Nusra could not only add to regional instability in the Middle East, but also rekindle global jihad.

"(CNN)A teen who lands in lockup a few times can get on a police department's nerves. But officers have taken a shine to Jamal Rutledge since they arrested him in September in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He helped save the life of the officer who was booking him. Now, he's their hero. Officer Franklin Foulks was filling out Rutledge's paperwork, as they sat alone in a holding area, where a surveillance camera recorded them. Rutledge, in cuffs, fidgeted on his seat, and stared at the floor, then he turned around to look through the security fencing behind him. That's when Foulks keeled over sideways off his stool. Rutledge turned around to find him on the floor grabbing his chest. The juvenile defendant yelled for help, Fort Lauderdale Police Department said in a statement Tuesday. He paced the processing cell and kicked the gate and quickly got other officers' attention. The officers rushed in, started CPR, called paramedics and gave Foulks a jolt with the defibrillator. Rutledge was led to another room. The juvenile defendant's quick thinking was key in saving Foulks' life, doctors told the police department. In a press photo, the officers who helped save Foulks lined up in honor of their heroic deed. In the middle was Rutledge in a proud pose. Smiles spread across all their faces. Next week, the city commission will honor them all in a meeting. Rutledge was being booked on probation violation and other felony charges when Foulks had the episode, South Florida's Sun-Sentinel reported, citing detective DeAnna Greenlaw. Officers have seen a lot of the teen since, Greenlaw said, having arrested him ""multiple times."" CNN's Tina Burnside and Rick Martin contributed to this report.","Jamal Rutledge was being booked, when Officer Franklin Foulks keeled over .

"Sandy Hook Elementary School probably did everything right. Its staff worked every day to create a climate of kindness over bullying. They had lockdown drills that trained everyone to stay low and quiet in the event of an emergency. A security system introduced this year required visitors to ring a bell, sign-in and perhaps produce a photo ID. After 9:30 a.m., the doors were locked. And now it's the home of the one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history. Twenty children dead and eight adults, including the shooter. Those who know the world of school security are already predicting what comes next: A strong reaction -- maybe an overreaction -- by parents, schools and legislators who want to take action. Politicians will be elected on platforms of school safety. Vendors will turn up with technology and security plans to sell. Schools will rewrite their crisis plans and run extra drills. It happened after the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, in 1999, and again after the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech. And within a few months or years, it'll be back to cutting security budgets and fighting for time to train staff and teachers on safety protocol. Psychologist didn't come back alive . ""The vast majority have a crisis plan on paper. It's much more common that we find those plans are collecting dust on the shelf and they're not a part of the culture or the practice,"" said Kenneth Trump, a school security consultant. ""I don't believe we need to throw out the book of best practices on school safety. I think we do need to focus our resources, times and conversation back on the fundamentals."" Every school should have crisis teams that review their plans regularly, he said, and staff members who greet and challenge every person who comes to the door. They should have locked doors, safety drills and parents who know where to find their kids, just in case the unthinkable happens. Schools need counselors, psychologists and officers building relationships with kids, because they are the best line of defense, Trump said. Is there no safe place? ""As they've cut back on the human element, they've tried to compensate by leaning on and pointing to physical security measures,"" Trump said. ""They love to say 'We have cameras.'"" The details about Sandy Hook aren't clear yet. Did the suspect, Adam Lanza, enter before the doors locked? Did he say anything to anybody beforehand, leave any trace of his plan? Could a locked door or a kind word possibly have stopped him? ""The saddest thing about these incidents is they're over so fast, a law enforcement response almost never accomplishes anything,"" said Katherine Newman, co-author of ""Rampage: The Social Roots of School Shootings."" Shootings happen in places ""exactly like this,"" Newman said -- rural areas or exurbs where violence never seems to be a problem. But the typical perpetrator belongs to the school community, someone staff would easily let in. You can't fault Sandy Hook's administrators and teachers, said Newman, dean of Johns Hopkins University's school of arts and sciences. They stayed in lockdown and stuck to plans that might have saved kids' lived. Stories are emerging about teachers who pulled kids to safety and demanded proof that police were really who they said they were. It probably wouldn't have changed anything in Newtown, Newman said, but every school would be wise to re-evaluate its security measures. Newman advocates for more school resource officers, unarmed law enforcement representatives, who kids are taught to trust. There aren't many at elementary schools, she said, and their positions are often among the first cut from middle and high schools in tough economic times. ""Kids have to know that they can come forward and what they'll talk about is confidential, but also taken seriously,"" Newman said. ""They are the ones privy to leakage of intentions and rumors. Trapping that information and getting it to the right place is a very important defensive measure."" The kids in elementary school today weren't even born when the Columbine shooting took place, she said. How could they know such a thing is possible, that there's history behind those lockdown drills and buzzer systems? After the Columbine shooting, districts renovating and building schools studied what they could do to make them safer, architect Irene Nigaglioni said, and the changes are clear on some campuses. They began to build single, prominent entryways, and reduced landscaping that provided a place to hide, Nigaglioni said. They shifted restrooms away from entryways and moved major mechanical and electrical systems so they couldn't be shut down or vandalized from the outside. They put simpler keyless entry systems on doors to make it less tempting to prop them open. They planned elaborate announcement systems that let police address a shooter without speaking to every classroom. ""Year by year, they're trying to do what they can with the money they have,"" said Nigaglioni, chairwoman of the board for the Council of Educational Facility Planners International. ""Anything that is going to make it harder to get through a building."" But in recent years, schools also came to value natural light and open spaces that allow classes to collaborate. Walls once made of brick are now made of glass. They fold up and disappear, if they're there at all. It's better for learning but tougher for security, Nigaglioni said. ""It's becoming a challenge,"" the Dallas-based architect said. ""We're breaking down the school into more small learning communities, the school within a school. You might not have a wall, so securing your hallway or pod is how you do it."" If there's a shooting, an explosion, an illness, it can sometimes be limited to one room or one hallway. At Sandy Hook, students were killed in two classrooms. But plenty of schools don't have even those options. John Kuhn is superintendent of the Perrin-Whitt Consolidated Independent School District, a rural district northwest of Fort Worth with just a few hundred students. He spent Friday afternoon celebrating Christmas with his elementary school students, pretending not to know the news. ""Oh my gosh,"" he thought. ""I have to take care of these kids."" His schools will review their crisis plans and drills this week, he said. But there's no school law enforcement, and because it's a rural area, any police response could take a while. His middle and high school students circulate between five buildings during the school day, so they can't lock doors. Security systems cost money, he said, and when he's cutting teachers, how could he hire a police officer? ""Days like (Friday) make you think, is that the right decision? How can we make our systems airtight?"" he said. ""You know ultimately, you can't."" After Columbine, after Virginia Tech, after Sandy Hook, security experts said that will be the hard reality for every school, politician and parent to accept. ""There is not a single safety measure that anyone could have put in place at that school that would have stopped what happened,"" said Bill Bond, the school safety specialist for the National Association of Secondary School Principals. ""When you allow absolutely insane people to arm themselves like they're going to war, they go to war."" He calls metal detectors useless. Buzzer systems are just locked doors. Lockdown plans are important to keep people safe, but they don't keep evil out. ""In a school, your only real protection is kids trusting you with information,"" Bond said. ""If they don't trust you with information and someone is planning to do something, it's a matter of how many will be killed before you kill him."" When it comes to shootings, Bond calls himself a cynic. Over the course of 12 seconds in 1997, one of his students shot and killed three classmates, wounded five more, then put the gun in Bond's hand. Bond was principal at Heath High School in West Paducah, Kentucky, then. The shooter was 14. Michael Carneal was later sentenced to life in prison. Bond stayed on at Heath long enough to see survivors graduate. The school's culture changed overnight, he said, to one of support and trust. After three funerals, the bullies changed. He retired and built another career talking to high schoolers about security. He tells them to pay attention to what they hear and tell people who can help. That, he promises, works. He's not in Newtown yet, he said, because, well, what could he say to 6 year olds? What could he say to their parents to make this better? Nothing, he says. Not a thing. People are sharing their concern and sadness over the Newtown school shooting. What are your thoughts? Share them with CNN iReport.","The school in Sandy Hook did a lot right, but the shooting happened despite their efforts .

"(CNN) -- A northern California couple have offered a ""full confession"" for their role in kidnapping Jaycee Dugard and holding her for 18 years, a defense lawyer said Monday. Stephen Tapson, the court-appointed attorney for Nancy Garrido, told reporters that she and Philip Garrido had given ""full and complete statements"" to the El Dorado, California, sheriff's office -- including one such session in which Dugard was in the same room, separated from her alleged abductors by only a table. ""They've been honest with them, in the hope of mercy on the behalf of Mr. Garrido for Mrs. Garrido,"" said Tapson, who does not represent Philip Garrido. The pair told authorities ""everything they wanted to know."" Dugard was 11 years old when she was snatched in 1991 from the street in front of her home in South Lake Tahoe, California. Authorities say the Garridos held Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years. She was 29 when she was found in August 2009 at the Garridos' home in Antioch, California, about 120 miles from her house. Garrido, a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest, has been accused of fathering two daughters with Dugard during her captivity. Tapson alluded to Nancy Garrido's role in kidnapping Dugard and other issues, while distancing his client from her part in the forced sexual relationship between Dugard and Philip Garrido. He said that Nancy Garrido served as a mother figure to Dugard's children, fathered by Philip and born while Jaycee was in captivity. Calling his client's case ""a classic example of really lousy taste in men,"" Tapson said he'd likely argue that Nancy Garrido suffered from ""Stockholm syndrome"" -- unswervingly following her husband, even when it meant committing illegal acts. Nancy Garrido ""doesn't want to disengage"" with her husband -- ""but hopefully she will, with urging,"" her lawyer said. Neither Garrido has pled guilty to any crimes, as of yet. Absent a plea agreement, Nancy Garrido could face 278 years, eight months in prison, while Philip Garrido might get upwards of 440 years, according to Tapson. Dugard now lives in seclusion with her mother, Terry Probyn, and Dugard's two daughters. Officials had previously said Dugard does not want to speak to either Garrido. Tapson said he has asked to speak to Dugard but that she has not talked to him as of yet. He said Nancy Garrido was in ""tears"" when she saw Dugard, who listened to a confessed statement from the two at the El Dorado Sheriff Office's detective bureau. Tapson spoke Monday outside El Dorado Superior Court in Placerville following a brief hearing into several media outlets' request to make public grand jury testimony and Philip Garrido's mental health records. Judge Douglas Phimster denied the motion, according to a court statement, saying that doing so ""will prejudice (the Garridos') right to a fair trial."" Philip Garrido will next be in court March 17, according to the El Dorado Superior Court website, for his arraignment -- a step that has been delayed amid questions about his mental competence. There is no posted date for Nancy Garrido's next court appearance.","NEW: A judge denies media's request for grand jury testimony and other info .

"Prince Edward Island, Canada (CNN) -- Prince William splashed down a helicopter in a Canadian lake Monday, while his newlywed bride Catherine watched from shore -- all part of a full slate of activities on Prince Edward Island on the fifth day of the royal couple's Canadian tour. Intermittent rain did not prevent the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge from enjoying a host of events on the island, which borders the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. That included racing in dueling dragon boats, being ceremonially ""smudged"" at a beach and savoring seafood on the sand. The royals' day began with a visit to Province House, the second-oldest active legislature building in Canada. There, they greeted many of the hundreds of people who'd gathered for a look at the newlyweds. Afterward, the couple headed to Dalvay-by-the-Sea. There, Prince William -- a military helicopter pilot by training -- joined his Canadian counterparts in taking part in a ""waterbird"" emergency landing in a nearby lake. In the exercise, which was originated by Canadian armed forces for use in search-and-rescue missions, the helicopter's engine is cut off and it then lands in the water. When it was about one-quarter submerged, the propellers were restarted to bring William and others on board back into the sky. Both William and his wife then boarded dueling dragon boats with others for a race. Other highlights on Monday included musical performances in the rain and a lobster bake on the beach. Later Monday, the royal couple will fly for roughly 2,300 miles to Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, for the next phase of their trip. William and Catherine are expected to visit a total of four provinces during their nine-day tour -- their first official foreign trip as a married couple. After the Northwest Territories, they will go to Alberta. Their upbeat if occasionally soaked Prince Edward Island visit came a day after the most controversial stop on their tour in the French-speaking province of Quebec. William and Catherine attended a ""Freedom of the City"" ceremony at Quebec City Hall, where the prince addressed the crowd in French after being met by cheering supporters.  Nearby, a small but vocal group of anti-monarchy protesters gathered. Canadian broadcaster CBC reports that Quebec's relationship with the monarchy has often been strained, with the Queen met by booing protesters on a visit to the province in 1964. The royal couple also visited Maison Dauphine, a center that provides assistance to troubled street youth in Quebec. They posed for pictures and seemed at ease as artists showed off their work. The prince played a quick game of foosball. After they wrap up their Canadian tour on Friday, the duke and duchess will head to California for three days. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.","Prince William and his wife Catherine visit Prince Edward Island on their Canadian tour .

"President Barack Obama told congressional leaders on Tuesday he has the authority to carry out his planned strategy against ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria without authorization from legislators, but he asked for their support to show the nation was united. Obama ""reiterated his belief that the nation is stronger and our efforts more effective when the President and Congress work together to combat a national security threat"" like the Sunni jihadists who call themselves the Islamic State, a White House statement said. ""The President told the leaders that he would welcome action by the Congress that would aid the overall effort and demonstrate to the world that the United States is united in defeating the threat,"" it added. Earlier, two senior legislators -- one from each party -- told CNN's Dana Bash that a congressional vote on military action against the jihadists was unlikely despite calls for one by many of their colleagues. While some in Congress want to vote on the matter, taking up such a volatile issue as military action weeks before the November elections may be politically dangerous. Others in Congress argued the President already has the authority he needs to expand attacks on ISIS under war powers granted more than a decade ago to go after al Qaeda. Obama has been criticized by conservatives and some Democrats for what they call a timid response so far to the threat by ISIS fighters who emerged from Syria to rampage through northern Iraq. The President authorized airstrikes on ISIS targets in Iraq earlier this year, but he now faces pressure to expand the campaign to go after the extremists in Syria. Obama and his top aides call such a military step one part of a broader strategy against ISIS that includes establishing a stable representative government in Iraq, forming an international coalition including Middle East countries to combat the extremists and increasing military aid to moderate opposition groups in Syria fighting ISIS and the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The top Republicans and Democrats from the House and Senate  -- House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, along with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California -- got the first glimpse of Obama's plan to ""degrade and defeat"" ISIS at a White House meeting on Tuesday. As strategy firms up, U.S. courts partners to target ISIS . Afterward, Boehner said in a statement he would support Obama if the President deployed the U.S. military to help train and advise Iraq forces and assist with targeting ISIS leadership. ""I think we have to take them out,"" Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland told CNN on Tuesday, in reference to targeting ISIS leaders. Administration officials also planned to brief all legislators this week on the the threat from the extremists who call themselves the Islamic State, while Secretary of State John Kerry left Tuesday to push Sunni leaders in Jordan and Saudi Arabia to join the United States and its allies in combating ISIS. Next week, Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will appear at congressional hearings to discuss the President's ISIS strategy, the White House said. A year ago, Obama failed to secure congressional support for airstrikes inside Syria after international observers concluded al-Assad used chemical weapons on civilians. Obama launched the current air campaign against ISIS in Iraq, which has included more than 100 strikes against the militants, without specific approval from Congress beyond the President's power to protect American interests abroad and help alleviate humanitarian situations. Obama's ""core coalition"" won't defeat ISIS without Mideast nation . White House lawyers must determine whether a plan to go after ISIS further, which could include airstrikes on targets inside Syria, would require a vote in Congress. Polls have long showed Americans tired of war after lengthy engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, though a CNN survey released Monday indicated  76% supported additional airstrikes against ISIS. More than seven in 10 said Obama should ask Congress for approval, and eight in 10 said Congress should grant it. ""If this is going to be a prolonged fight against ISIS, it seems to me that there is no way to avoid coming to the Congress for an authorization for the use of military force, which comes before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the Democratic chairman of that panel. Republican Rep. Peter King of New York, however, told CNN on Tuesday that Obama should act first and get the approval from Congress afterward. ""This is so imminent, this is so critical, I want the President to take the action and then Congress should pass legislation supporting what the President does,"" King said. ""I don't want him to wait until Congress acts because I don't have full faith in Congress myself, to be honest with you."" The White House said it's continuing to seek a ""buy-in"" from Congress on any plan to defeat ISIS, though officials say that doesn't necessarily mean a vote on military action. Meanwhile, Obama will address the nation Wednesday night in a speech that will focus on three major themes, a senior administration official  told CNN's Jim Acosta. He will frame the threat posed by ISIS, outline his strategy to address that threat and outline a series of new proposals on how to fight and ultimately destroy the terror group, the official said.

"In case you missed it, a comet grazed the sun on Thanksgiving Day. Expectations had been high that Comet ISON would survive this close encounter, swing around the sun and put on a fantastic sky show. It was hoped it might even become a Great Comet, with massive tails visible to the naked eye. But something really bad happened and now it looks like ISON may be just dust in the solar wind (the sun was uninjured, FYI). Here's what we know now about ISON: . 1. Is ISON dead? Well, maybe. After the comet flew about 730,000 miles above the sun's surface, it started fading in images taken by NASA spacecraft. Things got so bad that Karl Battams, an astrophysicist with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and one of ISON's top fans, er -- chief observers -- wrote an obit for the comet. Despite the eulogy, Battams said we have to wait for the Hubble Space Telescope or other telescopes to confirm ISON's fate. ""It seems unlikely at this stage that anything of significant size remains but Hubble observations would help clear that up,"" Battams told CNN in an e-mail. NASA also hinted there may be a bit of hope for ISON in its latest update posted online Wednesday. The agency said it will use space telescopes to monitor ISON for the next several weeks because it's possible that dust is hiding a new, smaller version of it. ""Most agree that up to 90% of ISON was destroyed, leaving approximately 10% of the comet intact. If previous sungrazing comets are any guides, there may be a sizeable piece of comet nucleus left. At this point, though, scientists are waiting for a variety of telescopes to make observations before the status of Comet ISON can be confirmed."" 2. What do we call ISON now? ""I don't think there is an official term yet,"" Battams said. ""I have been referring to it as a comet remnant, and that seems pretty appropriate."" 3. ISON wasn't a flop. Okay, it won't be a ""Great Comet"" or the ""Comet of the Century."" But ISON did become a social media superstar and it gave scientists tons of data. ""It's disappointing that we didn't get a spectacular naked-eye comet,"" Matthew Knight of Comet ISON Observing Campaign said in a NASA science article. ""But in other ways I think Comet ISON was a huge success. The way people connected with Comet ISON via social media was phenomenal; our Comet ISON Observing Campaign website earned well over a million hits; and I had trouble downloading images near perihelion because NASA's servers were swamped. ""So maybe ISON was the 'Comet of the New Century,'"" he said. NASA deep-sixes Deep Impact comet hunter . 4. ISON won't be forgotten. ISON's fate has become a near obsession for a special Facebook group set up by physicist and astronomer Padma Yanamandra-Fisher with the Space Science Institute and the ISON observing campaign. More than 300 members have been tracking the comet and sharing amazing pictures. Many are still looking for ISON's remains and they aren't ready to declare it dead. ""I think the evidence shows that something catastrophic happened to the comet, but I don't think anyone is 100% sure,"" said Yanamandra-Fisher. ""Ground-based observations and orbiting telescopic observations, such as Hubble Space Telescope, later in December are important."" 5. But wait, there's more! Believe it or not, ISON is not the only comet! ""There are several comets to enjoy right now,"" Battams says. He likes Comet Lovejoy (discovered by Australian amateur astronomer Terry Lovejoy), Comet Encke and Comet LINEAR. ""The bottom line is that there are several comets still visible, and even when the bright comets have gone, there will always be more. The night sky is full of wonderful things to observe, too, so people absolutely should get outside and explore the skies!"" Battams said. If you're ready to go comet-hunting, here are some websites that ISON observers say might help: .","NASA telescopes are hunting ISON's remnants .
A chunk of the comet may have survived .
Comet-watchers are not giving up on ISON ."
"Today, the United States is conducting offensive cyberwar actions around the world. More than passively eavesdropping, we're penetrating and damaging foreign networks for both espionage and to ready them for attack.  We're creating custom-designed Internet weapons, pre-targeted and ready to be ""fired"" against some piece of another country's electronic infrastructure on a moment's notice. This is much worse than what we're accusing China of doing to us. We're pursuing policies that are both expensive and destabilizing and aren't making the Internet any safer.  We're reacting from fear, and causing other countries to counter-react from fear.  We're ignoring resilience in favor of offense. Welcome to the cyberwar arms race, an arms race that will define the Internet in the 21st century. Presidential Policy Directive 20, issued last October and released by Edward Snowden, outlines U.S. cyberwar policy.  Most of it isn't very interesting, but there are two paragraphs about ""Offensive Cyber Effect Operations,"" or OCEO, that are intriguing: . ""OECO can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance U.S. national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging.  The development and sustainment of OCEO capabilities, however, may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist. ""The United States Government shall identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power, establish and maintain OCEO capabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S. offensive capabilities, and execute those capabilities in a manner consistent with the provisions of this directive."" Opinion: Cyber arms control? Forget about it . These two paragraphs, and another paragraph about OCEO, are the only parts of the document classified ""top secret.""  And that's because what they're saying is very dangerous. Cyberattacks have the potential to be both immediate and devastating. They can disrupt communications systems, disable national infrastructure, or, as in the case of Stuxnet, destroy nuclear reactors; but only if they've been created and targeted beforehand. Before launching cyberattacks against another country, we have to go through several steps. We have to study the details of the computer systems they're running and determine the vulnerabilities of those systems. If we can't find exploitable vulnerabilities, we need to create them: leaving ""back doors"" in hacker speak. Then we have to build new cyberweapons designed specifically to attack those systems. Sometimes we have to embed the hostile code in those networks, these are called ""logic bombs,"" to be unleashed in the future.  And we have to keep penetrating those foreign networks, because computer systems always change and we need to ensure that the cyberweapons are still effective. Like our nuclear arsenal during the Cold War, our cyberweapons arsenal must be pretargeted and ready to launch. That's what Obama directed the U.S. Cyber Command to do.  We can see glimpses in how effective we are in Snowden's allegations that the NSA is currently penetrating foreign networks around the world: ""We hack network backbones -- like huge Internet routers, basically -- that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one."" The NSA and the U.S. Cyber Command are basically the same thing. They're both at Fort Meade in Maryland, and they're both led by Gen. Keith Alexander. The same people who hack network backbones are also building weapons to destroy those backbones.  At a March Senate briefing, Alexander boasted of creating more than a dozen offensive cyber units. Longtime NSA watcher James Bamford reached the same conclusion in his recent profile of Alexander and the U.S. Cyber Command (written before the Snowden revelations).  He discussed some of the many cyberweapons the U.S. purchases: . ""According to Defense News' C4ISR Journal and Bloomberg Businessweek, Endgame also offers its intelligence clients -- agencies like Cyber Command, the NSA, the CIA, and British intelligence -- a unique map showing them exactly where their targets are located.  Dubbed Bonesaw, the map displays the geolocation and digital address of basically every device connected to the Internet around the world, providing what's called network situational awareness.  The client locates a region on the password-protected web-based map, then picks a country and city -- say, Beijing, China. Next the client types in the name of the target organization, such as the Ministry of Public Security's No. 3 Research Institute, which is responsible for computer security -- or simply enters its address, 6 Zhengyi Road.  The map will then display what software is running on the computers inside the facility, what types of malware some may contain, and a menu of custom-designed exploits that can be used to secretly gain entry.  It can also pinpoint those devices infected with malware, such as the Conficker worm, as well as networks turned into botnets and zombies -- the equivalent of a back door left open... ""The buying and using of such a subscription by nation-states could be seen as an act of war. 'If you are engaged in reconnaissance on an adversary's systems, you are laying the electronic battlefield and preparing to use it' wrote Mike Jacobs, a former NSA director for information assurance, in a McAfee report on cyberwarfare.  'In my opinion, these activities constitute acts of war, or at least a prelude to future acts of war.'  The question is, who else is on the secretive company's client list?  Because there is as of yet no oversight or regulation of the cyberweapons trade, companies in the cyber-industrial complex are free to sell to whomever they wish.  ""It should be illegal,' said the former senior intelligence official involved in cyberwarfare.  'I knew about Endgame when I was in intelligence. The intelligence community didn't like it, but they're the largest consumer of that business.'"" That's the key question: How much of what the United States is currently doing is an act of war by international definitions?  Already we're accusing China of penetrating our systems in order to map ""military capabilities that could be exploited during a crisis.""  What PPD-20 and Snowden describe is much worse, and certainly China, and other countries, are doing the same. All of this mapping of vulnerabilities and keeping them secret for offensive use makes the Internet less secure, and these pre-targeted, ready-to-unleash cyberweapons are destabalizing forces on international relationships. Rooting around other countries' networks, analyzing vulnerabilities, creating back doors, and leaving logic bombs could easily be construed as an act of war.  And all it takes is one over-achieving national leader for this all to tumble into actual war. It's time to stop the madness. Yes, our military needs to invest in cyberwar capabilities, but we also need international rules of cyberwar, more transparency from our own government on what we are and are not doing, international cooperation between governments and viable cyberweapons treaties.  Yes, these are difficult.  Yes, it's a long slow process. Yes, there won't be international consensus, certainly not in the beginning. But even with all of those problems, it's a better path to go down than the one we're on now. We can start by taking most of the money we're investing in offensive cyberwar capabilities and spend them on national cyberspace resilience.  MAD, mutually assured destruction, made sense because there were two superpowers opposing each other.  On the Internet there are all sorts of different powers, from nation-states to much less organized groups.  An arsenal of cyberweapons begs to be used, and, as we learned from Stuxnet, there's always collateral damage to innocents when they are.  We're much safer with a strong defense than with a counterbalancing offense.","Bruce Schneier: U.S. is pursuing policies that are destabilizing and expensive .

"Some people think International Women's Day, which comes right in the middle of Women's History Month, is overdoing it. If ""underdoing it"" were a phrase, it's the one I would use. On most days in most months, most women and girls aren't able to raise their voices. Because no one knows the challenges they face, they're forced to face them on their own. On International Women's Day, however, we make a point of hearing the voices of every woman and girl. Today, we make sure that every woman and every girl counts -- literally. I'm talking about a project that combines two of my favorite topics: women's empowerment and data. The media sometimes call Bill and me ""data nerds."" I'm not sure they mean it as a compliment, but I wear it as a badge of pride anyway. Data is not boring. If you use it right, it tells the hidden stories of millions of women and girls. That's why the Gates and Clinton Foundations are teaming up to conduct a global review of the status of women and girls everywhere. Where they're thriving -- and why. Where they're being held back -- and why. This initiative is called No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project. The seed for this project was planted in 1995 at the Fourth World Conference on Women. That's where Hillary Clinton gave her famous speech declaring ""women's rights are human rights."" It's also where 189 countries came together to agree on an agenda for women's equality. Now, nearly 20 years later, it's time to check in to see whether we're meeting those goals. My husband Bill and I used a trove of data to drive our decision making at Microsoft, and we brought that mentality to our work at the foundation, though the data is much harder to come by when it comes to development. It's troubling that it's possible to produce precise reports about software sales in Kansas, but we have only rough estimates of how many mothers die during childbirth every year. Why is data an indispensible tool for improving the lives of women and girls? First, it helps us make the case to world leaders that empowering women isn't just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing. The data says that women spend 90 cents of every dollar they make on their children. They prioritize things like health care, nutritious food, and education. As a result, a child in a household where the mother controls the budget is 20% more likely to survive -- and much more likely to thrive. Healthier, more educated children today means a stronger workforce tomorrow. I've seen firsthand that this argument resonates with finance ministers -- even those who are otherwise skeptical about the need to invest in women and girls. There's another reason data is so important. It helps us see where women and girls are being left behind, so we know where to target resources. For example, in the Indian state of Bihar, data showed that women were dying during childbirth at alarming rates and giving birth in hospitals at very low rates. In response, health officials decided to encourage women to give birth in hospitals and to improve the quality of care in delivery rooms. Now, our partners in Bihar are collecting data every six months to monitor their progress and adjust their strategies as necessary to keep getting better results. Above all, data is powerful because of the women behind it. We should never lose sight of the fact that every data point represents a mother, a daughter, or a sister. Every data point represents big dreams for the future. On a recent trip to Tanzania, I met women who had pooled their savings. With their shared funds, they bought chickens so they could sell eggs for extra income. When I asked them what they'd use the money for, they all said: their children's education. Their investments in their children were a monument to their hope for the future. All of these women could see a better life for their families -- and, as members of the savings circle, they could envision themselves helping create it. On this International Women's Day, I hope you'll take the time to learn more about women who are working hard to raise their voices. Pick a topic you care about -- maternal mortality, women's economic participation, family planning -- and learn about the people whose lives it touches. As you read over the data, remember that the numbers you see tell the story of real women with real dreams. It's up to us to make sure they count. And it's up to us to keep the spotlight on them all year long. If we do, then by next International Women's Day, we'll have even more reasons to celebrate.","Melinda Gates: On International Women's Day, make every woman count--literally .

"The Colorado movie theater where a shocking gun rampage in July killed 12 people and wounded 58 others reopened Thursday despite criticism from the families of some of the victims. A night of remembrance was held at the Aurora Century 16 cinema complex in the theater next to the one where James Holmes, a 25-year-old former doctoral student in neuroscience, is alleged to have carried out the terrifying shooting spree. In an effort to offer support, elected officials and community members joined victims and their relatives at the ceremony, which was followed by a screening of ""The Hobbit."" They also acknowledged that the decision to reopen the movie theater remained controversial. Earlier this month, the relatives of nine people killed in the attack said the invitation to the remembrance event was ""disgusting"" and ""wholly offensive to the memory of our loved ones."" They criticized the timing of the invitation, two days after Christmas, and called it a publicity ploy by Cinemark USA, which runs the movie theater. Accused gunman's doctor, university face lawsuits . ""Our family members will never be on this Earth with us again and a movie ticket and some token words from people who didn't care enough to reach out to us, nor respond when we reached out to them to talk, is appalling,"" the family members wrote in a letter to the theater chain's management that they shared with CNN. Local officials, though, described the re-opening Thursday as a positive step for the community. Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan said it was ""part of the recovery process,"" and that he had attended the event because he could not ""allow the shooter in any way, shape, or form to win."" ""We heard overwhelming support from the people of Aurora to reopen it and restore its place as a valued part of our community,"" Hogan said. ""Many still suffer or grieve, and we will continue to support all of them in whatever way we can for as long as they need it."" Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper echoed Hogan's sentiments. ""Everyone heals, some slower, some in different ways, some wanted this theater to reopen, some didn't,"" Hickenlooper said. ""For many here tonight, this is the path to healing and part of that process. For everyone here, I think I speak for the entire state that we remain here for you, for the entire community of Aurora. Colorado is with you."" Some of the victims of the shooting who attended the event said they drew strength from it. ""I feel like I'm a different person for coming, and that brings about some healing,"" said Marcus Weaver, who was shot in the arm in the attack. ""And just like with my arm, it's going to take some time to heal."" Tim Warner, the chief executive officer of Cinemark, which is facing lawsuits from several victims' families and survivors, praised the city for its resilience and thanked the first responders who assisted the victims. ""Recovery is an ongoing process, and we are glad to be with you tonight to acknowledge how far we have to come and how far we have yet to go,"" he said. Cinemark has switched the way it identifies the different theaters at the Aurora Century 16 from numbers to letters. Theater 9, where the shooting happened, is now officially known as Theater I. The remembrance ceremony, which started and finished with a prayer, took place as courts deal with the consequences of the attack. Holmes is awaiting formal arraignment for 166 charges -- including murder, attempted murder and weapons offenses -- related to the July 20 rampage, which took place during a screening of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises."" And 14 people have recently filed legal documents indicating they are planning to sue Dr. Lynne Fenton, the psychiatrist who treated Holmes, and the University of Colorado Denver, where she worked, for negligence. Jacque Montgomery, a university spokeswoman, said university officials are aware of the pending lawsuits. ""We understand that there is pain and frustration amongst the families of the deceased and victims of this terrible crime, and we have great sympathy for them,"" Montgomery said in a statement. ""We do believe, as well, that the facts will speak for themselves as the legal process moves forward.""","A night of remembrance is held at the Aurora Century 16 movie theater .

"The former Rutgers University student convicted of spying on and intimidating his gay roommate was released from jail Tuesday after serving his sentence, a jail official said. Dharun Ravi, 20, was found guilty in May of invasion of privacy, witness tampering, hindering apprehension and bias intimidation. He left the Middlesex County Jail in North Brunswick, New Jersey, on Tuesday morning, according to Edmond Cicchi, warden of the Middlesex County Office of Adult Corrections. Ravi was released early after jail officials applied five days of good behavior and five days of work credit to his term, Cicchi said. Ravi's former roommate, 18-year-old Tyler Clementi, killed himself by jumping off a New York bridge after learning Ravi had secretly recorded Clementi and his partner with a webcam. While Ravi could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison, New Jersey Superior Judge Glenn Berman instead gave him a 30-day jail sentence, three years of probation and ordered him to complete 300 hours of community service aimed at assisting victims of bias crimes. The judge said he took Ravi's youth and his lack of a criminal record into consideration when handing down his sentence. Ravi began serving his term on May 31, two days after apologizing in a written statement for spying on Clementi. His lawyer filed a notice of appeal of his conviction earlier this month. On Monday, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said it would not deport Ravi to his native India. The agency is legally prohibited from deporting legal permanent residents unless they have been convicted of crimes such as an aggravated felony, domestic violence or drug or weapons offenses, a spokesman said.","He was released early after time off for good behavior and work credit, jail official says .
