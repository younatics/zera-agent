"Richard Branson once said 'Business opportunities are like buses; there's always another one coming.' If that's the case, he must have a fleet of depots filled with double deckers. One of his latest business ventures  to come under the spotlight is Kasbah Tamadot - the Virgin Atlantic boss's Moroccan holiday home which has just won ninth place in Conde Nast Traveller's best hotels in the world. As well as making space for Branson twice a year, the renovated riad tucked 4,300 feet above sea level in the Atlas mountains has 27 rooms  which you can now book into from £345 a night (4,890 MAD)  through Better Late Luxury, a travel company who offer deals on luxurious holiday destinations. Scroll down for video . Stunning scenery: a view of Branson's Kasbah Tamadot in Morocco, which sits 4,300 feet above sea level, as the sun sets behind the magnates giant infinity pool . Upgrade to the master suite in peak season and you’ll have to dig deep. It costs almost £1,800 (25,000 MAD) per person per night. For that, you get a private swimming pool, terrace and three bedrooms. Mick Jagger, Annie Lennox and Peter Gabriel have already been and when the man himself does he likes to sleep in Room 31 now named Tarrat, which is – aptly - the Berber word for Virgin. Book through Better Late Luxury and you can stay in a superior room for £345 a night. Enjoy the outdoor cinema (left) or swim in the 'reflecting' pool (right) The property has a infinity pool, sauna, multiple jacuzzis, a tennis court, ping pong table gym and outdoor cinema. Or you can go for a ride on one of Branson's four mules - Peppermint, Parmesean, Paprika and Peanut - who live in a menagerie with three donkeys and two camels. The grounds are extensive, with courtyards and landscaped gardens. Every room is stuffed with antiques and you can book in to one of nine Berber tented suites from £609 (8,650 MAD). These are traditional style luxury tented rooms overlooking a valley below. Each has a king bed, terrace, view of Mount Toubkal, the Atlas' highest peak, and most come with a Jacuzzi. Room with a view:  one of the Berber tented suites overlooking a pretty valley that offers guests a king bed, large bathtub and private terrace . Sir Richard purchased Tamadot in 1998 after his parents spotted it, fell in love with the place and insisted he buy it. He paid about $1.5 million for the tumbling riad, displacing an antique dealer who had been living there. It's a one hour jeep ride from Marrakech (or a quarter of an hour by helicopter, though Branson apparently prefers to travel by car) and if you're lucky you might catch a sight of him - when he’s there he likes mingling with guests. The height of luxury: each of Sir Richard's Berber tents has a king bed, terrace, view of Mount Toubkal, the Atlas' highest peak, and most come with a Jacuzzi . He told Forbes, 'I think life is all about meeting people. If you own a place like the Kasbah Tamadot, you know it's important to say hello to the guests, it's important that you shake hands, and it's important that you ask questions.' The mogul, best known for founding Virgin Group with an estimated net worth of  US$4.6 billion, also has properties on Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands and the Ulusaba Private Game Reserve in South Africa.

"Liverpool are exploring the possibility of sending Suso to Sevilla as part of a £16million deal to sign exciting left back Alberto Moreno. Moreno is training with Spain in Madrid, having just arrived home from Sevilla’s post-season tour of Indonesia and could play in his country's friendly against Bolivia. The 21-year-old has been closely watched by Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City this season but after a bright start had some indifferent performances in the second half of the season. Nevertheless, there is no doubting his ability and his age allows room for improvement. Target: Liverpool have stepped up their efforts to sign Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno (left) On duty: Moreno is training with the Spain squad in Madrid ahead of the World Cup . On loan: Suso spent last season at Almeria . Liverpool have taken the initiative with an opening offer and are willing to use 20-year-old unsettled midfielder Suso as a sweetener. The Spain U21 star had a successful loan spell at Almeria last season and Sevilla are keen to help him put his career back on track. Liverpool continue to negotiate with Bayer Leverkusen over midfielder Emre Can although his wage demands have taken them by surprise. Leverkusen are one of the few clubs in the Bundesliga that compete with Premier League wages. Rodgers has been looking at signing a top class left back for more than 12 months and tried to bring Guilherme Siquiera to Anfield last August before he eventually brought Aly Cissokho in on a season long-loan. Academy graduate Jon Flanagan ended up filling the role with distinction but he is naturally right-footed and will be moved across in time. Liverpool have also been considering Chelsea's Ryan Bertrand as an option. Manager Brendan Rodgers is also ready to signal a move for Swansea's Michel Vorm now that Lukasz Fabianski has joined Swansea from Arsenal. Xherdan Shaqiri remains an option should Liverpool fail to sign Adam Lallana. The 22-year-old Swiss international indicated he was ready to leave Bayern telling 20 Minuten: 'It's clear that I cannot continue like this. If nothing changes, I will have to make some changes myself. I want to play in the important games as well and not just in the Bundesliga. I don't want to go through another year like this. Hole: Liverpool experimented with Jon Flanagan (above) and Aly Cissokho at left back last season . 'I only want to play for a major club. The Champions League is important to me. We will see what happens. England would be an option. If I were to leave Bayern, it will be for a foreign club. But it will have to be a club challenging for the title.' Liverpool have made a fresh enquiry about free agent Seydou Keita, 34, but he is also considering a new offer from Valencia. Liverpool spoke to Keita in January but he was apparently upset when it became clear they wanted him as a squad player.","Liverpool step up effort to sign Sevilla left-back .

"An athlete who spent a year training for a gruelling triathlon missed it - because he overslept. Jody George spent months taking donations and keeping friends up to speed on his preparation for the Challenge Weymouth Triathlon, which would have seen him swim 2.4miles, cycle for 112miles and then run a marathon. Mr George set his alarm for 3am, giving him plenty of time to drive to Weymouth Bay, Dorset, for the start. But the 34-year-old, who was due to be raising funds for Devon and Somerset Air Ambulance, after hitting snooze and not waking until 5.55am - far too late to make it in time. Scroll down for video . Jody George spent a year training for the gruelling triathlon in Weymouth only to oversleep and miss it entirely . Mr George, from Othery, Somerset, said the moment he realised he had missed the race was one of the worst of his life. He said: 'I set the alarm on my phone for 3am. It went off but I hit snooze, as I normally do. 'The only trouble was I hadn't switched on the snooze facility for the new time. I went back to sleep, and the next thing was the alarm going off at five to six. 'I held the phone in my hands and looked at the time for a while in disbelief. I knew instantly that was it. 'I was in total shock. I just went downstairs and made a cup of tea and said to my fiancee PJ, ""that's that, I'm not racing today"". 'She was the one shouting and swearing, I was in shock for days. 'It took me a good two or three days to recover emotionally to be able to even talk about it. 'I'm still quite upset with myself. I had to apologise to everyone who had supported me, who had sponsored me and donated. Mr George was forced to admit the embarrassing situation to his friends and family who had sponsored him hundreds of pounds for the challenge, but . 'I'd prepared for a year, I'd posted it all on Facebook, giving updates on the training, and everyone was following it and encouraging me. 'In fact, the last post the day before said that I felt quite relaxed about the race the next day - I was obviously a little bit too relaxed.' Mr George, a manager at a buildings maintenance company, was forced to admit the embarrassing situation to his friends and family who had sponsored him hundreds of pounds for the challenge. He wrote in a post on his JustGiving page: 'I would like to apologise to everyone that has sponsored me through this page. This morning I failed to start in the event and have let you all down. If you would like me to refund your donation, please let me know. I'm so sorry Jody.' Determined not to let his friends down, he recreated the triathlon near his home on the Somerset Levels. Yesterday morning, making the 6:30am start this time, Mr George swam several lengths of the River Sowy, before completing a bike ride and marathon around the village of Burrowbridge, completing the challenge in around 14 hours. He said: 'There is no way I will miss this now. It's actually helped raise donations - and no one said they wanted the money back. 'Focusing on this has kind of pushed that upset to one side.' So far Mr George has raised more than £1,000.","Jody George raised hundreds of pounds for charity in lead up to the race .

"Not since Wimbledon has Andy Murray played 40 minutes of tennis as nerve shredding as this passage that came on a Parisian lunchtime, the conclusion of which saw him squeeze through to the last 16 of the French Open. Resuming at 7-7 against world No 24 Philipp Kohlschreiber he needed to draw on all his Grand Slam experience to eke out a 3-6 6-3 6-3 4-6 12-10 victory that took two days to complete and 247 minutes on the court.

"MPs will question Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe next month over the investigation into missing teenager Alice Gross . MPs are set to haul Britain's top police officer and prosecutor to the Commons over the investigation into missing teenager Alice Gross. Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe and the Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders will be questioned amid growing anger over foreign criminals living freely in Britain. It comes after it emerged the on-the-run chief suspect in the 14-year-old's disappearance is a convicted killer from Latvia. Arnis Zalkans, 41, went missing a week after Alice vanished while walking close to the Grand Union Canal near her home in west London on August 28. CCTV shows Mr Zalkalns riding a bicycle 15 minutes later past the same spot. Mr Zalkalns was jailed in 1998 for his wife's murder. He served seven years before moving to the UK. He was allowed to stay in the country despite being investigated in 2009 over an alleged indecent assault on a 14 year-old in Ealing, west London. Home Affairs Select Committee chair Keith Vaz said it was 'absurd' that officers had not issued a European Arrest Warrant for Mr Zalkalns and vowed to get answers from Britain's most senior policeman and prosecutor once Parliament returned next month. Mr Vaz said: 'It's absurd. A European Arrest Warrant should have been applied for. 'At the very least they could have gone before a judge, who may have granted them one. 'We will be seeking answers.' Mr Vaz, speaking to the Sun, said it was 'incredible' that the family of Cancer sufferer Ashya King were tracked down with an arrest warrant - but not in this case. He told the newspaper: 'We need to know whether the problem is with the Warrants or with the Criminal Justice System.' UKIP leader Nigel Farage has attacked EU freedom of movement rules which stop the Government refusing entry to convicted criminals. He said: 'Convicted Latvian murderer is suspect in disappearance of Alice Gross. EU rules mean we can't stop people like this entering the country.' But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg this morning said the problem was actually EU countries not sharing enough information about criminals crossing borders, risking a furious response from Tory MPs. He called on countries in the European Union to share 'much, much more information' about serious convicted criminals with each other. In his Call Clegg show on LBC this morning, the Lib Dem leader said: 'Nothing has been proved, but the finger of suspicion is pointing very clearly at this Latvian individual. Why did we not know that he had this conviction? 'Where somebody has been convicted of a crime elsewhere in the European Union we need to provide much, much more information.' He added: 'The countries in the EU don't send much more information to each other about individuals who have a serious, criminal record. That can easily be fixed,' he said. 'You can create databases and decide which crime you have on that database. You can protect the freedom to move while also protecting our safety by knowing who has a crime against their name so that people can be checked as they move across the European Union.' But a month after Alice's disappearance, senior detectives have admitted they still have no idea if the chief suspect remains in the UK or if he has fled overseas. Commander Graham McNulty of Scotland Yard has admitted that even if he was located in Latvia, they are powerless to arrest or even question him, because at this stage they lack the evidence to apply for a European Arrest Warrant. Police who searched the west London home he shared with his girlfriend and child, found his passport and said he has not used his phone or accessed money from his bank account. But there are increasing fears that he may have slipped out of the UK and returned to Latvia where he could be being sheltered by members of the criminal fraternity he met while in prison. Police staged a re-enactment of the last sightings of Alice as she walked along the towpath at Trumpers Way bridge in west London . The Director of Public Prosecution Alison Saunders (left) and Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe (right) will give evidence to MPs next month over the investigation into Alice's disappearance . It comes as the desperate family of the missing teenager spoke of their 'agony' over her disappearance as police staged a reconstruction of her last known steps on the day she went missing. Worried father Jose Gross, 60, mother Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, and sister Nina, 19, pleaded with Alice to return home, and spoke of how they longed to hear the musical teenager sing again and see her smile. 'Alice has been missing for four weeks now,' the family said in a statement. 'We are desperately concerned about her welfare and worry constantly about what may have happened to her. 'We are appealing to Alice. If you are out there, to come home where you belong. We love you and we miss you. We want to see your smile again, we want to hear you sing again, to see you cuddle Peggy, or sit at the piano. We want to be a family again.'","Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe will be questioned by MPs .

"The full scale of violence and corruption in Libya since the fall of Colonel Gaddafi has been laid bare in an Amnesty International report accusing the world of 'turning a blind eye' to  war crimes. Since the dictator's death in October 2011, the then Western-backed rebel groups have split into two  rival camps - one based on hardline Islamist ideology and the other a largely secular faction. Amnesty has now accused both groups of 'running amok' and using armed gangs to torture and murder their rivals, saying the feuding militias have 'committed a wave of abductions targeting civilians based on their origins or perceived political allegiance'. The human rights organisation added that the international community is choosing to ignore the 'chaos engulfing Libya' however, saying the option to punish those responsible for potential crimes against humanity is available to the International Criminal Court, but has simply not been taken up. Conflict: Libyan military soldiers fire their weapons during clashes with Islamist militias in Benghazi yesterday . Masked: A Libyan regime solider takes cover during clashes with Islamist militants in Benghazi yesterday . Colonel Gaddafi died after the UN security council approved bombing raids led by Britain, France and the U.S. designed to assist rebel militias battling against forces loyal to Gaddafi on the ground. He was eventually captured and shot dead by the victorious rebels in 2011. But threat of extreme violence has remained near-constant presence in Libya since the civil war came to an end three years ago, as the once relatively united rebel militias struggle to find common ground on the extent to which  religion should play a role in rebuilding the country. The deep ideological divisions have led to both sides committing human rights abuses in the subsequent battle for power, Amnesty International claims in its latest report. Detained: A suspected Islamist militant is arrested by forces loyal to the Libyan regime in Benghazi . A soldier loyal to the Libyan regime fires at Islamists using a machine gun mounted on a pick-up truck . 'Armed groups have tortured - and probably summarily killed - detainees in their custody, and have committed a wave of abductions targeting civilians based on their origins or perceived political allegiance,' the report explains. 'Likewise, satellite images released today by Amnesty show that fighters on all sides in the conflict have displayed an utter disregard for civilian lives, launching indiscriminate rocket and artillery fire into crowded civilian neighbourhoods,' the human rights group added. Amnesty cited specific accounts from Libyans caught up in the conflict - particularly in two cities key to the overthrow of Gaddafi in 2011, Misurata and Zintan. While militia in Misurata are backed by Islamist groups linked to Ansar al-Sharia - the organisation accused of the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens, fighters in Zintan are allied with the fledling Libyan regime, now based in the city of Tobruk. Fighting: A Libyan regime soldier fires at Islamists in Benghazi yesterday. Only three years ago the groups fought side by side during a civil war that led to the death of dictator Colonel Gaddafi . A soldier loyal to the Libyan regime loads his gun before setting off to fight Islamists in Benghazi . Rebels from Misurata and other Islamist-dominated towns seized Libya's capital Tripoli in August, finally forcing divisions between the rival groups into open warfare. The North African country has had two governments and parliaments since a militia group seized the capital, setting up its own cabinet and assembly. Since then there have been accusations of tit-for-tat kidnappings in the areas around Misurata and Zintan - with detainees from either side saying they have been savagely beaten and tortured. Amnesty says photographs of corpses suggest a number of men taken captive were later murdered by the feuding militia, adding that others remain missing and are presumed dead. Amnesty's report concludes that not enough is being done by the West to bring an end to the violence, adding that the option to punish those responsible for potential crimes against humanity is available to the International Criminal Court, but has simply not been taken up. 'The international community has largely turned a blind eye to the chaos engulfing Libya since the 2011 uprising,' the report claims. A Foreign Office spokesman told the Telegraph that Britain remains committed to playing its part in Libya, and is helping to negotiate an 'essential' political settlement between the rival groups. Libya has had two governments and parliaments since an Islamist militia group seized the capital, Tripoli, setting up its own cabinet and assembly. Pictured is Benghazi during clashes yesterday . Western powers worry that the Libya is heading towards another civil war as authorities are too weak to control Islamists defying the state's authority in order to grab power and a share of oil revenues . This morning Libya's internationally-recognised Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni said he was ready for peace talks with Islamist groups controlling Tripoli,as fresh fighting in Benghazi killed 20 people. Thinni set one condition for talks with his rivals, however. 'We open the doors of dialogue with our brothers on the condition that there be concessions from all sides,' he told reporters in Khartoum at the end of a three-day visit to Sudan. His comments were more conciliatory than recent statements when he had vowed to liberate Tripoli militarily, a plan analysts say is unrealistic as the weak government forces are no match for better-equipped rebels. Western powers worry that the Libya is heading towards another civil war as authorities are too weak to control Islamists defying the state's authority in order to grab power and a share of oil revenues.","Former anti-Gaddafi rebels are now deeply divided along religious lines .

"Critic: Author and educator Camille Paglia wrote a column for Time arguing that college-age women often become victims of rape because they are naive about men's true evil nature . Self-described 'dissident feminist' Camille Paglia has written an op-ed piece for Time Magazine arguing that female college students are naive and careless about the true nature of men as sexual predators. Paglia, 67, a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, penned the column this week in reaction to the recent abduction of University of Virginia sophomore Hannah Graham, 18, who was last seen two weeks ago in the company of a 32-year-old nursing assistant. Jesse Matthew was captured in Texas last week and charged with abduction with intent to defile, but so far there is no sign of Graham. In her provocative opinion piece, Paglia builds her argument on the premise that young, college-age women often become victims of sexual assault because they have a false sense of security and do not keep their guard up in public places. Dismissing claims about an epidemic of sex assaults on campuses as 'wildly overblown,' the well-respected social critic writes that the true danger to female students is 'the ancient sex crime of abduction and murder.' She goes so far as to say that colleges should stick to academics instead of lecturing students about sex assault, which in her mind is an exercise in futility. Paglia essentially says that on a biological level, men are wild beasts driven by atavistic desires, and that our society has done women a great disservice by leading them to believe otherwise. 'Too many young middleclass women, raised far from the urban streets, seem to expect adult life to be an extension of their comfortable, overprotected homes,' Paglia says. 'But the world remains a wilderness. The price of women’s modern freedoms is personal responsibility for vigilance and self-defense.' Paglia also takes a swipe at the American education system, accusing teachers and schoolbook authors of sanitizing history by removing any mention of ‘horrors and atrocities’ stemming from evil that it part and parcel of human nature. Case in point: The op-ed piece was written in reaction to the abduction of 18-year-old college sophomore Hannah Graham, who went missing two weeks ago in Virginia after being last seen with an older man . In her article for the Time titled 'The Modern Campus Cannot Comprehend Evil,' Paglia argues that both the liberal and conservative worldviews are lacking a profound sense of evil because it is much easier to blame an outside force for all our troubles. Paglia's possibly most controversial point is that critics and thinkers debating gender ideology erroneously think that the fundamental nature of man can be changed for the better, and that their violent instincts can somehow be tamed with the help of campus initiative and well-meaning speeches. ‘But extreme sex crimes like rape-murder emanate from a primitive level that even practical psychology no longer has a language for,’ she states. According to the renowned feminist author, an 'alienated loser' motivated by an ancient hunting reflex would prey on an unsuspecting, random woman simply to live out a sexual fantasy, or to punish the female sex for his own failures. Paglia concludes: ‘young women do not see the animal eyes glowing at them in the dark. Controversial: Paglia, 67, argued that America's educators of every stripe are doing womne a disservice by making them believe that man's sexual desires can be tamed . ‘They assume that bared flesh and sexy clothes are just a fashion statement containing no messages that might be misread and twisted by a psychotic.’ Paglia is the author of the much-talked-about 1990 bestseller Sexual Personae, in which she argues that the human nature has an inherently dangerous aspect to it, especially when it comes to sexuality. In 2005, she was named as one of the top 100 public intellectuals by the journals Foreign Policy and Prospect.","Social critic and author Camille Paglia wrote an opinion piece for Time Magazine addressing so-called sex assault epidemic on campuses .

"The Australian bride charged with adultery and bigamy offences while visiting her boyfriend in Lebanon has tearfully told of the ordeal which saw her fleeing from authorities and dodging bullets. Sydney mother and teacher Mahessen Issa also revealed to Channel Seven's Sunday Night program what drove her to the edge of forced her halfway around the world into another man's arms. Ms Issa and her estranged husband Bassam Abou Lokmeh were separated when she decided to travel to Lebanon earlier this year, and their relationship had been in jeopardy for a long time before. Scroll down for videos . Mahessen Issa (left), the Sydney woman who left Australia and her estranged husband has told of how she and boyfriend Mohammed Awick (right) spent months running from Lebanese authorities . Ms Issa and Mr Awick had a commitment ceremony in Lebanon, but insist it was not a wedding and therefore they are guilty of no crime . 'It got to a point where I couldn't bear to see him anymore, the disrespect in front of people, because he knew I didn't want a bar of him, I didn't want him to come next to me at all,' Ms Issa revealed. 'And he tried many many times to try to fix the relationship, but you can't, you can't piece back something that's broken a long time ago.' When asked what forced her into the spontaneous decision to travel to Lebanon for two weeks on June 20 while her former husband was looking after their children, the mother-of-two said she had simply reached the end of her tether. 'I think I just cracked, I'd just had enough,' Ms Issa revealed. The mother broke down when she revealed her ordeal and how she could not speak to her children . When she touched down in Lebanon, Mr Awick - who proposed to her just hours after meeting her - would quickly find that they would be living their lives on the run for the next few months. The couple first stayed with Mohammed's mother and her seven other children, and revealed how she would hug the youngest who was 'the same size as my daughter'. But their trouble really began when Mr Lokmeh hired a Lebanese lawyer to officially register their Australian marriage in a Lebanese Sharia court, meaning her marriage or commitment to Mr Awick could land her in jail. Her best hope was to prove to the Islamic court she's not married to her new partner. After gunshots were fired into the apartment the pair were forced to flee to another part of the country, where they met with Ms Issa's lawyer, Zali Burrows, who had flown from Sydney to help her. Ms Burrows went to Lebanon to negotiate with Mr Lokmeh's lawyers and told of her reasoning for wanted to assist Ms Issa. 'She told me what was happening and I just knew I had to help because she didn't have anyone in the community putting their hand up for her,' Ms Burrows said. Sydney lawyer Zali Burrows flew to Lebanon to assist Ms Issa and negotiate with her estranged husband's lawyers to get Ms Issa back to Australia . Ms Issa revealed how grateful she was that Mr Awick had stayed with her, admitting she would have fled if the situation was reversed . 'Her family had disowned her and not one single Muslim group had actually put a statement out there in support of her, she was basically abandoned. On the program Ms Issa also told of the fear she and her boyfriend spent living in and how she was scared her new man would leave her. 'He risked his whole life for me,' she said. 'I was honestly scared that he would, because anyone would run - I would! 'If I was in a predicament like that and I was going to jail I would run. '(But) he didn't. I never left him and he didn't leave me.' When Ms Issa's estranged husband Mr Lokmeh saw pictures of Ms Issa and Mr Awick allegedly marrying in early July and alerted authorities, that began a months-long hunt for Ms Issa. But Ms Issa told Sunday Night the pictures were actually of a commitment ceremony, rather than a wedding. Dressed in white and wielding a bouquet of roses, Ms Issa entered a commitment ceremony with her new partner, Mohammed Awick. The pictures, posted online, would lead to her being accused of bigamy . 'In love': Sunday Night reporter Steve Pennells told Daily Mail Australia Ms Issa and Mr Awick have a very real relationship . Reporter Steve Pennells, who travelled with Ms Issa during her time on the run, said she was desperate and at risk of 'real danger' while in Lebanon. 'At times, she was frantic, scared and demoralised, verging on hysterical - she was pushed to the edge,' Mr Pennells said. Ms Issa, who was only meant to stay in Lebanon for two weeks, was unable to see or talk to her two children, both under the age of 10. She had no money, Mr Pennells said, and even heard reports her house had been rented out without her consent and possessions taken or sold. In July, husband Mr Lokmeh told Daily Mail Australia his wife was 'a devil... This lady, she's a devil.' He expressed outrage that his wife had married another man before their divorce was finalised and had 'deserted our children'. Dark times: While stuck in Lebanon, Ms Issa heard rumours her home had been rented out without her consent . When Ms Issa, pictured here with partner Mohammed Awick, travelled to Lebanon in June she only expected to stay for two weeks . Relatives said they had 'disowned' her, with one telling Daily Mail Australia Ms Issa was crying so sympathetic Australians would come to her aid. 'We tried to put a stop to it but she decided to proceed with her marriage in Lebanon...now it has backfired on her. 'She's not going to jail because of adultery, she's going to jail because she got married while she was still married. 'That's illegal everywhere, not just in Lebanon. All she's doing is crying out for Australia to help her.' Ms Issa resurfaced in Australia in earlier this month. Ms Issa returned to Australia recently, but revealed her cousin was the only person to greet her as the rest of her family had abandoned her . She said Mohammed is her true soulmate and she hopes to be reunited with him in the future . It remains unclear how she returned as her passport was 'flagged' by the Lebanese Government following the charges. Ms Issa applied to bring an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) against Mr Lokmeh at Bankstown Local Court on October 9, but her application was dismissed. At the heart of Ms Issa's saga, Mr Pennells said, was a 'very, very messy break-up story'. Ms Issa described Mr Awick as her soulmate, and revealed to the show she had never been in love like this, despite now being back in Australia without him. He was recently denied a visitors visa. 'They always say you always know your soulmate and truly, he is. 'He loves me, and I love him, and I've never ever been in love like this.' When asked by reporter Steve Pennels, who travelled with Ms Issa during her time on the run who she considered her husband to be, the Sydney teacher had no hesitations. 'Whether now, tomorrow, two months time, forever, Mohamed,' she said.","Mahassen Issa was on the run in Lebanon for two months .

"Hunt workers have been caught on video allegedly feeding foxes offal and eggs in a bid to boost the population. Members of the North Cotswold Hunt in Gloucestershire were allegedly filmed dumping dozens of dead chickens, eggs and rats into a rural valley in a bid to 'fatten up' animals before hunting. After feeding the animals over several weeks, the men allegedly coaxed them out from setts and released the hounds on them. Scroll down for video . A video filmed over a number of weeks in an artificial fox earth purports to show the animals being fed eggs and offal by huntsmen in an alleged breach of the Hunting Act 2004 . A view of one of the setts which campaigners say was blocked with dirt when hunters drew the foxes out . The footage was taken by animal campaigners who have accused the hunt of going against 'their own guidelines' by allegedly encouraging the fox population with a view to kill the animals. Filmed over a number of weeks, the video shows the animals thriving on a high protein diet before being drawn out and prevented from returning, activists claim. Hounds are then released, with the foxes allegedly unable to hide in badger setts which campaigners say have been blocked. Under the Hunting Act 2004 it is not illegal to encourage hounds to hunt foxes, however driving foxes to a hunt area with intent to pursue them is a breach of the law. 'Somebody would be doing this purely to encourage foxes to breed, to stay here so that they can obviously be in the vicinity of when the hunt choose to hunt,' a spokesman for Hunt Saboteurs Association in North Gloucestershire said. Various vehicles were followed from the site in Gloucestershire to the hunt's kennels upon review of the film . A pile of dead animals and eggs was filmed at the site where foxes were thriving on the high-protein diet . A variety of people, allegedly members of the North Cotswold Hunt, visited the site over a number of weeks . 'If they have a food source they don’t need to travel and they don’t need to go anywhere else. It’s certainly immoral. It would go against their own guidelines. 'The hunt can be seen feeding foxes near an artificial earth in order to maintain a steady supply of foxes in a particular location. 'This location is a popular meet of theirs and the footage shows them actively hunting their hounds in that precise spot. 'Members of the hunt can also be seen blocking up a disused badger sett that is used by foxes in order to stop the fox being able to seek refuse when being chased by hounds. 'A fox can then clearly be seen running past the blocked sett closely pursued by hounds who are being encouraged to chase it by hunt supporters. 'Some of these acts, such as encouraging hounds to chase the fox, are illegal in their own right. 'Others, such as the feeding of foxes, while not illegal in themselves show an intent by the hunt to encourage foxes to an area where they like to hunt. 'Presumably this can only be because they wish to hunt these foxes in direct contravention of the Hunting Act.' 'The hunt denies taking part in any illegal activity, dismissing critics' claims as 'confused and vexatious'. The hunt is accused of breaching the Hunting Act 2004, but denies all allegations saying no members have ever acted outside of the law . People at the site were seen filling up setts in an alleged bid to prevent the foxes from hiding once the hounds were released . The foxes began to thrive on the high-protein diet at the fox earth in Gloucestershire over the weeks of filming . At the end of the video, the hounds are released and begin hunting the foxes. North Cotswold Hunt deny partaking in any illegal activity . 'The North Cotswold have been hunting within the law since the Hunting Act came into force in 2005 and no one connected to the hunt has ever been charged with, let alone convicted of, a Hunting Act offence. 'The hunt denies all the allegations made by animal rights activists, which are confused and vexatious.' Evidence of hunts feeding foxes and creating artificial earths first emerged around 15 years ago when anti-hunt campaigners found men from the Beaufort Hunt feeding fox cubs near their Badminton Estate base in south Gloucestershire. The evidence helped to undermine the case that fox hunting was needed as pest control.","Vehicles traced back to hunt's kennels visited the site in Gloucestershire .

"Bad parents should be given government classes on how to cuddle their children, according to a major new report. Politicians have been reluctant to ‘call out’ bad parenting, despite this having a bigger impact children than money or schooling, the former Labour minister Alan Milburn said. Mr Milburn, who was brought in by David Cameron as the Government’s social mobility Tsar, attacked MPs for being ‘tentative and timid’ about bad parenting. Parents need to be taught to cuddle their children to help cut the divide between rich and poor, according to a major new report . He called for a national parenting campaign, funded by cutting childcare tax breaks from families with at least one parent earning more than £100,000 a year. Mr Milburn’s report also calls for the best teachers to be paid more to work in deprived areas, action to close the gap in GCSE results between rich and poor youngsters and for universities to admit 5,000 more students from disadvantaged backgrounds by 2020. It also says that unpaid internships should be made illegal, and that the ‘living wage’ should be introduced by 2025. The recommendations come amid warnings that the generation of workers will stay poorer than their parents throughout their lives unless 'urgent action' is taken to boost wages and slash youth unemployment. Mr Milburn said the recession had condemned those in their twenties to 'the wrong side of the divide' between those with good jobs and their own homes and those stranded on low pay. He revealed wages for the under 30s had fallen by 10 per cent since the recession pricing people out of buying their own home. Wages for those in their twenties are back to where they were in 1998 – 16 years ago. The Government should introduce 'Supernanny'-style parenting classes, made famous by TV's Jo Frost (left), according to former health minister Alan Milburn (right) Child poverty is now a bigger problem than during the 1960s, a damning report to be published this week has found. The report was carried out by the National Children's Bureau and warns that Britain is at risk of becoming a place where 'children's lives are so polarised that rich and poor live in separate, parallel worlds.' It blames a 'failure of political will' has resulted in poorer children having fewer chances in life today. The report compares children's lives with data collected from a study called Born To Fail published in 1969. It found that around 3.6million children are now living in relative poverty today compared with 2million in the late 1960s. According to the report, a child from a disadvantage background is less likely to develop as quickly by the age of four than a child from a more affluent family. Children living in deprived areas are also more likely to be the victim of an unintentional injury or accident at home and are nine times less likely to have green spaces to play. While boys living in deprived areas are three times more likely to be obese than boys growing up in affluent areas compared with girls who are twice as likely to be obese. Mr Milburn said the UK was at risk of becoming a ‘permanently divided’ nation, with the poorest in society left behind. It says that the country is likely to see an unprecedented rise in child poverty over the next decade, amid the biting impact of welfare cuts and low pay. The report argues that there is a risk that 2020 could be a watershed moment between an era in which everyone saw a rise in living standards to one that sees the poorest lose out. It suggests that there is ‘little prospect’ of the immediate future promising more progress on social mobility - improving individuals' life chances - than the recent past. The commission, led by Mr Milburn, says that it shares the view of experts who predict that 2020 will mark not the eradication of child poverty but the end of the first decade in recent history in which it increased. ‘A decade of rising absolute poverty is unprecedented since records began in the 1960s,’ the report says. ‘There is a clear risk that the year 2020 will mark not just a failure to meet the Government's legal obligation to have ended child poverty but could mark a permanent decoupling of earnings growth and economic growth at the bottom end of the labour market. ‘2020 could mark a watershed between an era in which for decades there have been rising living standards shared by all and a future era where rising living standards will bypass the poorest in society.’ It adds: ‘Social mobility, having flatlined in the latter part of the last century, would go into reverse in the first part of this century. ‘The United Kingdom would become a permanently divided nation.’ The new goal for education should be closing the gap between between disadvantaged children and their better-off classmates, the report argues. On current trends, it is likely to be at least 30 years before the achievement gap at GCSE between these two groups is even halved, it warns. ‘The starting point should be parenting,’ Mr Milburn said. ‘Effective parenting has a bigger influence on a child's life than their wealth, their class or even their education. Most parents do a great job but some do not, and there has been a reluctance to call out bad parenting or to support more parents to develop their parenting skills.’ He said research found that four in 10 parents could be doing better, as he proposed the new national parenting programme, funded by cuts to childcare tax breaks. Previous attempts to improve parenting have been too timid, the Commission argues, and calls for schools to identify poor parenting if it is affecting a children's achievement and development. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today attacked the Tories for blocking the introduction of ‘meaningful’ new child poverty targets . In schools, it must be a ‘national priority’ to improve the academic results of poorer children. ‘Just as previous governments have set targets to raise the bar in schools to increase standards, we look to the next government to set new targets to close the gap,’ Mr Milburn said. ‘It should aim to eradicate illiteracy and innumeracy amongst 11-year-olds by 2025, and it should aim to halve the attainment gap between 16-year-olds entitled to free school meals (FSM) and their peers, not within three decades but within one, so that by 2020, at least 50 per cent of children on FSM are achieving five good GCSEs, including English and maths. ‘That is what London schools actually manage to do today. It is what schools in every part of the country should be doing within the next five years.' ‘What will make these stretching targets achievable is the quality of teaching that children receive. More needs to be done to get the best teachers to teach in the most challenging schools. ‘Earlier this year, the Commission surveyed over 1,000 teachers and found that better pay would be a powerful incentive to do so. For decades, pay systems have rewarded teachers equally whether they teach in a wealthy, leafy suburb or a depressed coastal town. ‘Narrowing the attainment gap cannot happen unless we break from that old orthodoxy. On assuming office, the next government should immediately commission the STRB (School Teachers' Review Body) to create new pay grades for the best teachers to work in challenging schools in the hardest to recruit areas. Despite recent falls in unemployment, the real value of people's stagnant wages are being eroded by inflation . The Government claims its 'long term economic plan' is starting to work - with more than half a millions people finding work last year . He also called for a new teachers' pay premium to offer 2,000 of the best teachers a 25 per cent pay uplift if they agree to work in a challenging school. Outside of education, the report warns that the UK is now facing a ‘two-tier’ labour market, with five million workers, mainly women, earning less than the living wage, which currently stands at £7.65 an hour outside London and £8.80 in the capital. The current national minimum wage is £6.50. ‘We believe the next government should work with employers, trades unions and others to achieve a new ambition for the UK to become a living wage country by 2025 at the latest,’ the Commission says . Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said child poverty is at its lowest for 30 years and there are now 290,000 fewer children growing up in workless households. ‘We would put it at the heart of how we address this the importance of work,’ said the spokesman. ‘It is through greater employment opportunities for the households in which children grow up that we can best address this issue. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he shared Mr Milburn's ‘despair with the Conservatives’ over blocking the introduction of ‘meaningful’ new child poverty targets. ‘It dismayed me then and it dismays me now that the Conservatives have basically decided to turn their back on child poverty,’ he told his regular Westminster press conference. Shadow trade minister Ian Murray said: ‘The last Labour government lifted over a million children out of poverty, helped thousands of families into work, built children's centres and introduced child and working tax credit to make work pay. But under David Cameron, child poverty is forecast to rise, not fall.’","Major new report on child poverty calls for nationwide parenting classes .

"Norwich City have taken the unexpected decision to appoint Neil Adams as their new manager after losing patience with Malky Mackay. The Canaries were hopeful of appointing the former Cardiff boss this week following extensive talks with the Scotsman. But on Thursday the club released a statement confirming caretaker boss Adams had been handed the job on a full time basis, signing a three-year deal. Three-year deal: Neil Adams took charge of the final five games of the season . It is understood the decision comes after Mackay refused to commit himself to the role over the last few days, leaving the Carrow Road club waiting for a definitive answer. And chairman David McNally has taken the decision to pull the plug on Norwich's interest as a result of Mackay's indecision. Adams, who led the Canaries to one point out of a possible 15 during his five games in charge, said: 'The priority is to ensure that attacking, attractive and winning football is once again the norm for supporters of this Club, and it is essential that we now have everyone pulling in the same direction for the challenges that lie ahead.' One of Adams' first priorities will be to resolve goalkeeper John Ruddy's future. Highly-rated: Canaries goalkeeper John Ruddy has been capped by England . Ruddy is set to quit the club in order to stay in the Barclays Premier League next season. Ruddy just missed out on selection for England's World Cup squad, but knows staying in the top-flight will enhance his chances of remaining in Roy Hodgson's thoughts. The 27-year-old is agonising over his future following the Canaries' relegation into the Championship last season. And it is understood Ruddy, who came close to a joining Chelsea last summer, wants to continue playing regularly at the top level. Familiar territory: Adams played at Carrow Road as a winger from 1994 to 1999 . However, the keeper is unlikely to consider leaving Carrow Road for a club without the guarantee of first-team football. Crystal Palace are monitoring Ruddy's situation as fears grow over the future of current No 1 Julian Speroni. It is also understood Arsenal have been made aware of his potential availability this summer.","Neil Adams appointed as Norwich City's new manager .

"Revenge porn is becoming an increasingly common way for embittered former partners to inflict pain. But victims often feel helpless, unaware of how to get pictures taken offline and deeply embarrassed. Folami Prehaya, whose ex posted intimate pictures online that were viewed 50, 000 times has bravely decided to speak out about this heinous crime to empower other victims, and has set up a website to help them. The case was reported by MailOnline earlier this month but Folami was not identified. Now she has broken her anonymity in a bid to help others. Folami Prehaya, whose ex posted intimate pictures online that were viewed 50, 000 times, is speaking out about the crime of revenge porn and the impact it had on her life . Folami's former boyfriend Thomas Samuel, 45, posted the explicit pictures of her using a spoof Facebook account after a bitter break-up and shared them with her family and friends. Although Facebook removed the pictures  quickly, they had already been picked up by numerous porn sites. Speaking on ITV's This Morning Folami explains: 'I feel totally embarrassed. It is so vindictive and cruel . 'It has literally ruined my life in the sense that the pictures are still out there and still being seen. The worst thing for me is i can't stop people viewing them, you have no control. Folami opened up on ITV's This Morning about how the act had 'ruined her life' 'Your personal, intimate stuff has gone public. To know they are being view on one porn site alone about 48,000 times it just awful.' 'I have tried to remove them and it's a lot harder than you think. You have to contact each webmaster one by one. Thomas Samuel, 45, posted the explicit pictures of her using a spoof Facebook account after a bitter break-up . 'Most of those I have contacted have been good and removed them but I am still struggling with some and my next step I suppose is to take them to court. 'I can't change it, I just try and move forward with my life.' She recalls how Thomas sent 15 to 20 friends requests from the spoof account to various people she knew of. A couple of hours later, Folami started receiving calls from family and friends telling her what had appeared on a Facebook page bearing her name. One friend, who accepted the request, said she saw a number of 'extremely explicit' pictures of the woman performing a sex act and other photos of a similar nature. She described the pictures as 'jaw-dropping'. Despite the deep level of humiliation she felt, Folami, from Bristol, was determined to not only get the photos removed, but also to see Thomas punished for his crime. She pursued the case to Bristol Magistrates' Court, where although Thomas was found guilty he avoided  prison after his six month sentence was suspended for two years. He was also given a restraining order to stay away from Folami and ordered to pay court fines. Folami, who is still fighting to get her picture removed from some sites, has set up a website to help others . Folami says that despite this low sentence, she doesn't feel that Thomas has won. 'By going to court, by speaking about it I am doing something. It may not be much of a sentence but at least it is something.' She has now set up a website 'Victims of Internet Crime' in a bid to help others. The website is a one-stop resource for free information on what victims can do in the aftermath of an online crime, and, more importantly, how they can prevent it in the future.

"The son of an influential village chief on  Koh Tao has been forced to take a DNA test after rumours swept the Thai island that he murdered two British backpackers there last month. Warot Tuwichian, 22, handed himself in to police yesterday after he was accused on social media of killing Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, on September 15. He underwent tests at four different hospitals. The university student is the son of Hat Sairee village chief Woraphan Tuwichian, who owns AC Bar where the two murdered tourists had a quarrel with some men before being killed later that night.

Raped and murdered: The battered bodies of British backpackers Hannah Witheridge (left) and David Miller (right) were found on the southern Thai island of Koh Tao on September 15 . Burmese nationals Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun have already been charged with the murders, but some have claimed they were framed to cover up Warot's involvement. However, initial tests at the The Institute of Forensic Science at the Police General Hospital, did not match the DNA in semen retrieved from the scene where Miss Witheridge was raped before being killed. Police are still waiting for the results of tests on samples taken by Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Siriraj Hospital and Ramathibodee Hospital. They said their results will be made public no later than Saturday. Mr Miller and Miss Witheridge's battered bodies were found on the southern island of Koh Tao on September 15. Thai police claimed a breakthrough in their investigation of the double murder when they said DNA from the accused migrant workers matched samples taken from the body of one of the victims.

Were they framed? Burmese migrants Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun participate in a crime re-enactment of the murders of two British tourists in Koh Tao, but later recanted their confessions. Thaiand's premier has now ordered a second DNA test on the men amid criticism of the police investigation . They said both men had also confessed and forced them to re-enact the killings in bizarre scenes before the world's media. But last week the men, both in their 20s, retracted their confessions alleging they were obtained under duress. Criticism of the police handling of the case has swirled both in Thailand and overseas. 'We will allow suspects to take another DNA test,' Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha told reporters after a weekly cabinet meeting. 'If they think that the previous tests were unfair we will conduct a second test.' It was not immediately clear if the accused had requested a second DNA test.

Thai authorities have strongly denied using the pair as scapegoats, insisting the case is built on solid evidence showing the DNA of the accused from initial tests matches samples taken from Witheridge's body. British police have been allowed to observe the investigation after the UK expressed concerns and offered to help with the probe. Before the murders, Thailand was already struggling to restore its tarnished image as a tourist haven after a May coup saw martial law imposed across the country. The murders have dented tourism, which accounts for nearly 10 per cent of gross domestic product, at a time when Thailand is still under martial law after a May military coup that had already kept some tourists away.","David Miller and Hannah Witheridge murdered on Koh Tao on Sept. 15 .

On Wednesday September 24 the robotic Mars Curiosity rover drilled 2.6 inches into an area of the base of Mount Sharp, a structure that reaches 3.4 miles towards the sky. The rover collected rock samples that it will later analyse with the rover's on-board instruments, reports Yahoo News. Data and images received on Thursday at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California confirmed success of the rock collection mission, NASA said in a statement released on Thursday. Hole for the history books: This image shows the first sample-collection hole drilled in Mount Sharp, the layered mountain that is the science destination of the Mars Curiosity rover's extended mission . Rover rocks!: This image is an artist's rendition of the Mars Curiosity rover that is currently exploring the martian territory to gain a better understanding of how the planet formed and if it could have hosted alien life . WHAT IS MARS? Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and the next planet beyond Earth. It is, on average, more than 142 million miles from the sun. Mars is about one-sixth the size of Earth. Mars is known as the Red Planet. It gets its red color from the iron in its soil. Mars is named for the ancient Roman god of war. The Greeks called the planet Ares. The Romans and Greeks associated the planet with war because its color resembles the color of blood. Mars has two small moons named  Phobos and Deimos. They are named for the sons of Ares, the Greek god of war. Phobos means 'fear,' and Deimos means 'panic.' Temperatures on Mars go way below freezing! The average temperature on Mars is minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Its surface is rocky, with canyons, volcanoes and craters all over it. Red dust covers most of its surface. Mars has clouds and wind, just as Earth does. WHAT IS THE MARS CURIOSITY ROVER? Curiosity is a car-sized, six-wheeled robot destined for Gale Crater on Mars. Its mission: to see if Mars ever could have supported small life forms called microbes...and if humans could survive there someday! In addition to super-human senses that help us understand Mars as a habitat for life, Curiosity's parts are similar to what a human would need to explore Mars (body, brains, eyes, arm, legs, etc.). Scientists hope that the rock samples will give them a better understanding of how Mars' Mount Sharp formed and what sorts of environmental events led to its growth. 'This drilling target is at the lowest part of the base layer of the mountain, and from here we plan to examine the higher, younger layers exposed in the nearby hills,' said Curiosity Deputy Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of JPL. 'This first look at rocks we believe to underlie Mount Sharp is exciting because it will begin to form a picture of the environment at the time the mountain formed, and what led to its growth,' he added. Scientists are specifically interested in Mount Sharp and are studying the rocks for clues about how Mars shifted from a possibly warm and wet world to a cold, dry, and barren landscape. The red planet:  Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and the next planet beyond Earth and is called the red planet because of its blood-red hue . Journey: This map shows the route driven by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover from the Bradbury Landing location where it first landed to the Pahrump Hills outcrop where it drilled into the lowest part of Mount Sharp . The Curiosity rover landed on Mars in August 2012 and first studied an area near the landing site in the Yellowknife Bay area of Mars. The rover drilled holes in an ancient lakebed that may have hosted microbial life over three billion years ago. Curiosity began its 5 mile journey to Mount Sharp in July 2013 and reached an outcrop at the mountain's base called Pahrump Hills one week ago. This was the moment scientists had been waiting for after 15 months and hundreds of millions of miles of travel. 'We're putting on the brakes to study this amazing mountain,' said Curiosity deputy project manager Jennifer Trosper of JPL. 'Curiosity flew hundreds of millions of miles to do this,' he added. On Monday September 22 the rover test drilled an area at the base of the mountain to gage sample collection. The trial went well so that’s why the team decided to go on a drilling mission on Wednesday. A mission team will deliver a powdered rock sample to Curiosity's open scoop were they will be able to determine if it's safe to send the rover's internal instruments called SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars) and CheMin (Chemistry and Mineralogy).

"You're off off on your travels and you want to get to the airport quickly and with no hassle. If you're flying from Heathrow, you might choose the Heathrow Express, which whizzes you through the West London suburbs. But as you look forward to your flight, I wonder if you stop to think that you're taking, on a cost-per-minute basis, the UK's most expensive train journey? Worth the money: The Heathrow Express is the quickest way to Heathrow - but the price can be off-putting . Travelling on the service from London Paddington to Heathrow's terminals 1-3 takes 15 minutes, and the standard single fare is an eye-watering £21 if you buy your ticket before you board. So as you speed along, you're spending £1.40 a minute. Pay for your ticket on the train and the fare is even steeper, at £26 - or £1.73 a minute. Given the sky-high prices, it's hardly surprising that leisure passengers make up only 30 per cent of Heathrow Express users. Rather belatedly, the company is trying to do something about this state of affairs by trialling a reduced-price fare. For tickets purchased between now and November 30, the cost of a single journey has been cut by 25 per cent to £15, and a return to £29 (down from £34). To get the discounted fare, you need to book at least seven days ahead online (www.heathrowexpress.com) using the promotional code OFFER15 (500 tickets are available each day). Though the Heathrow Express has offered deals for some time for couples and families, this is the first time it has lowered its prices for a person travelling on their own. Which is good news, particularly if the advance-purchase fare continues to be available after November. This way for Gatwick: There are cheaper - although not necessarily faster - alternatives to the Gatwick Express . But without wishing to pour cold water on the deal, there are still much cheaper, albeit slower, public transport options to get to Heathrow from London. Heathrow Connect (www.heathrowconnect.com) runs a stopping service between Paddington Station and Heathrow, taking 32 minutes to terminals 1-3. The return fare is £19.80 - £9.20 cheaper than the Heathrow Express advance-purchase return. Note that the Connect service is less convenient for terminals 4 and 5, as you need to change trains at the terminals 1-3 stop. There is also the Piccadilly Line on the Underground: central London to Heathrow takes around 45-60 minutes, but costs just £6.10 for return journeys using an Oyster card, or £11.40 return paying with cash. For journeys to other airports, it also pays to investigate the various options. For example, from London to Gatwick, the Gatwick Express (www.gatwickexpress.com) is the obvious choice. Its Victoria-Gatwick service takes 30 minutes and costs £31.05 return booked online. But with Thameslink (www.thameslinkrailway.com), you can travel from London Bridge to Gatwick in 29 minutes on an anytime return ticket costing from £19. Much cheaper still is easyBus (www.easybus.co.uk), non-stop from Waterloo or Earls Court to Gatwick, taking from 65 minutes. Think ahead: You can save money on the Stansted Express if you are prepared to book your ticket in advance . The cost is from just £4 return if you book well ahead, and the service is available to all airline passengers, not just those flying easyJet. For Stansted, it really pays to book ahead. The standard fare on the Stansted Express (www.stanstedexpress.com) is £33.20 return from Liverpool Street, compared with £16 return if you book online at least 30 days in advance. But easyBus can get you there and back for £4. You also need to be choosy if you are travelling cross-country to airports. Go by train and you can be hit with cripplingly high fares for peak-time journeys. Also, fixing the time of the return trip from the airport can be a headache, as you don't know whether your flight will be delayed or how long it will take to pick up your bags. Taking a coach can be well worth considering instead. National Express (www.nationalexpress.com) offers affordable fares to main airports from many UK cities. Over the summer it introduced a 'Flexible Add On' option which, for £5 extra each way, allows you to get on any available coach 12 hours either side of your timed departure.","Heathrow Express to offer discounted fares on a trial basis in November .

"Jackets fitted with airbags may not be new, but they’re typically reserved for professional motorcyclists or can be difficult to install. As an alternative, Alpinestars’ Tech-Air street system works like a lining for bike jackets and is portable - meaning it can be moved between jackets for different bikes and scooters. When the system detects an impact, a built-in canister and ‘bladder’ inflates to protect the wearer’s body. The Tech-Air street system, from Italian-based Alpinestars, is a portable unit that includes an air canister (left), an Airbag Control Unit (right), and cables that fit it to the jacket. When the electronics in the unit detect an impact, the canister inflates built-in 'bladders' to protect the wearer's body following an accident . The impact is monitored using sensors inside the Airbag Control Unit (ACU), and the whole system is powered by a lithium-ion battery. This battery takes around six hours to charge, and will last for more than a day on a single charge. In April, Swedish firm Hövding unveiled its airbag helmet for cyclists. The makers said that many modern bike helmets only just comply with European regulations, but their helmet performed considerably better in testing, making it three times safer than traditional helmets. They go on to explain that, using their inflatable helmet, the risk of fatal head injuries resulting from accidents can be reduced to almost zero. The ACU is a single component surrounded in fabric and a mesh. Cables then connect the unit to panels in the jacket and the whole system is sealed to make sure it’s waterproof. Alpinestars has said the jackets will launch in Europe in the spring. The vest itself will cost £999 (€1,199). Riders will then additionally need to buy compatible jackets. At launch, the technology will initially be available for a version of the current Valparaiso jacket, expected to cost £599 (€649). It will also be available for the lighter Viper jacket, worth £299 (€349). Both jackets will be fitted with an LED panel on the arm to make sure the system is working, and to make sure it has enough charge before the motorcyclist sets off.

"A Russian historian who dug up the bodies of 150 dead little girls in order to mummify them and dress them up in stockings for 'birthday parties' is not mentally fit to stand trial, a judge has said. Anatoly Moskvin, 46, from the city of Nizhny Novgorod in central Russia, was arrested in 2011 after it emerged he had dug up at least 150 corpses of girls aged between three and 12. He then took the bodies home and turned them into a grisly collection of mummies, dressing the bodies and skeletons in stockings and dresses and even making one look like a teddy bear. Sick: Anatoly Moskvin, 46, from the city of Nizhni Novgorod in central Russia, was arrested in 2011 after it emerged he had dug up at least 150 corpses of young girls aged between three and 12 . Moskvin, who speaks 13 languages and was described in court as a 'genius', gave the mummified corpses names and organised birthday parties for them. All of little girls had died years earlier. A video made by Moskvin and found at his apartment by investigators showed a corridor cluttered with wedding dresses and bright, colourful clothes. In a room the camera zoomed in on the faces of the girls' faces, wrapped in light beige fabric. A voiceover on the video said: 'These dolls are made of mummified human remains.' Location: Anatoly Moskvin kept the bodies at his home in the Russian city of Nizhni Novgorod (pictured) Police said Moskvin also compiled up-to-date information about the lives of each girl he had dug up and printed off instructions on a computer for how to produce dolls out of human remains. His macabre obsession was discovered when his parents visited him after returning from holiday. A prosecutor spokesman said: 'After three years of monitoring him in a psychiatric clinic it is absolutely clear that Moskvin is not mentally fit for trial. 'He will therefore be kept for psychiatric treatment at the clinic.'","Anatoly Moskvin exhumed 150 corpses of girls aged between three and 12 .

"Archer is now beginning a three-year jail term after admitting fraud and obtaining money by deception . As a former council ‘employee of the year’ and the head of crime prevention initiatives in his home town, David Archer’s reputation was impeccable. But behind the quiet, hard-working facade, the divorced father-of-six was stealing large sums from his employer. The senior manager for Chelmsford Council in Essex made more than £230,000 over six years by routing funds into bogus accounts of playground equipment suppliers. He is now beginning a three-year jail term after admitting fraud and obtaining money by deception. Judge Christopher Ball QC told him: ‘That money was spent not on a lavish lifestyle but more comfortable living for you and your family. The payments effectively doubled your salary, doubled it dishonestly. ‘It is often thought that when a large organisation or public authority loses out it is a victimless crime. I don’t think the ratepayers will see it that way. ‘There will be proceedings in an attempt to claw back as much as possible from you to make sure ratepayers are reimbursed.’ Archer, 56, joined the council 25 years ago and was employee of the year in 2001. At one point he was chairman of the Crime and Disorder Partnership alongside the police. Suspicions arose about him in 2010 when council officers questioned payments to two charities. Further inquiries revealed he had falsely claimed £232,456 from 2004 to 2010 in the name of two fictitious organisations, Essex Play Council and Chelmsford & Maldon Gold Plus. They were registered to his home in Chelmsford. Father-of-six Archer, 56, joined the council 25 years ago and was named as employee of the year in 2001 . The proceeds of the fraud were paid into his personal bank account and a joint account with his then wife, Nicola. The simple fraud involved submitting ‘vague’ invoices for play equipment and youth projects, signed off by Archer. He left a ‘clear and obvious’ audit trail, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. His wage averaged £2,353 a month but over the same period his monthly outgoings were £4,875. Christopher Paxton, defending, said: ‘The lack of control at Chelmsford Council was extraordinary. This lack of control fuelled his greed.’ The council confirmed it will seek to recover the stolen funds.","David Archer, 56, made more than £230,000 over six years by routing funds into bogus accounts of playground equipment suppliers .

"James Milner wants to leave Manchester City, with Arsenal interested in landing the midfielder this summer. The 28-year-old has grown tired of being overlooked in a central berth and has told Manuel Pellegrini he is seeking pastures new. That news has alerted Arsene Wenger, who is hoping to add serious quality to his squad in a bid to launch a sustained tilt at the Premier League title. On his way out? James Milner has told Manchester City that he wants to leave the club this summer . Make me an offer! Arsene Wenger is keen and is looking to bid upwards of £10m for the England international . Milner has forever been versatile but, as he draws towards the final third of his career, feels his future lies in the middle. It is an area the Gunners are looking to strengthen, and they are planning an offer upwards of £10million, with Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool also keen. The developments create a major issue for City, who are likely to lose the majority of their English players this summer. On the one hand they risk keeping a player who wants to be elsewhere, but there is the niggling doubt that they will be able to fill the Champions League's homegrown quota. Micah Richards, Jack Rodwell, Scott Sinclair, Gareth Barry and Joleon Lescott are all expected to depart the Etihad Stadium in the coming months. It would leave goalkeeper Joe Hart as the club's only Englishman, although Gael Clichy and Dedryck Boyata also qualify.

"Carl Froch has won what may be the most important of all the fights before Saturday night’s Battle of Britain with George Groves at Wembley. The key battleground, to put it in political parlance, has been the timing of the weigh-in. This issue has proved even more contentious than the disputes over who should referee Froch-Groves II and which judges should be scoring at ringside. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Froch entertain the Nottingham crowd during media workout . Early boost: Carl Froch, pictured at last year's weigh-in, will be glad to get the next weight-in on Friday . Face off: George Groves (left) is the heavier man, and wanted the weigh-in sooner rather than later . For Groves, naturally the bigger and heavier man, the earlier the better when it comes to stepping on the scales the day before the fight. For Froch, the less time his world title challenger has to recover from draining down to the 12 stone super-middleweight limit and then gainingextra poundage, so much the better. London’s Saint George is understood to have argued for the weigh-in to take place no later than 1 pm on Friday. Froch is pleased it is being scheduled three hours later for Sky Sports television. This has been the most private of the many pre-fight disputes. So much so that it was not even raised during their verbal show-down on Sky’s Gloves Are Off television special which aired at the weekend. Not even when the confrontation ended with a handshake which turned into momentary arm-wrestling. Quite what that little skirmish proved only the combatants themselves might tell us. Pre-match dispute: The argument has been private, so much so that it wasn't raised on Sky Sports . Confrontation: The pair come together during the photocall for the rematch at Wembley . Froch said only: ‘We can all pull about a bit if you want. Pull and push a little.’ Groves, for the first time, has brought in a physical conditioning coach-cum-dietician following their first fight last November. That ended in him being stopped somewhat prematurely after decking Froch in the first round and being ahead on the score-cards going into the ninth. London’s Saint George reports himself physically stronge and his upper-body looks more muscular. But the Nottingham Cobra suspects that as a result he may find it more taxing to make the weight. Froch says: ‘Genetically, George is not a super-middleweight. He is naturally a light-heavy. He always has to take off about eight pounds just before the weigh-in. That’s not good and it’s one reason why he runs out of stamina in the later rounds.’ If he is right, those three hours could be a factor. It is beyond doubt that Groves will be the significantly heavier of the two by the time they enter the ring at ten minutes to ten on Saturday night. But the longer his wait to hit the required 168 lb target and the less time to rebalance his body weight, the more that advantage is diminished. Froch says: ‘I never have a problem with the weight. I walk around between fights only a few pounds over the limit.’ There is no risk of a dehydration problem orany other extra health risks in the weigh-in taking place at 4 pm rather than 1 pm. It is only in recent years that this process has been brought forward from the morning of fights to the preceding day. The IBF, the lead sanctioning organisation in this war for their world title and the WBA ‘regular’ belt, stipulate only that the weigh-in must happen at least 24 hours before the first bell. In the rancorous build up so far, Groves successfully appealed to the IBF for a mandatory re-match amid the controversy which followed their first fight. His demand for non-British officials was also granted, even though Froch condemned that as an insult to the British Boxing Board of Control. Fresh: Froch will be looking to keep his super-middleweight titles and insists he has no problem with the weight . Froch’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, then objected to the appointment of US referee Jack Reiss, saying: ‘He tends to work in the fighters’ faces and jump between them. We have 80,000 ticket buyers coming to Wembley and millions watching no television. They deserve a referee who will let them fight, let it flow.’ Reiss has been replaced by another American, Charlie Fitch. Then Groves, now his own manager, lodged a complaint against one of three foreign judges,  Leszek Jankowiak, on the grounds that he is Polish and that Froch’s has parental roots in that country, as well relatives still living there. Groves says; ‘In a fight of this magnitude it is wiser to pay attention to every detail.’ Following that Friday afternoon weight-in, such matters as approval of the gloves to be won and testing of the tension of the ring ropes remain to be agreed. Come Saturday night, renowned American ring announcer Michael Buffer might consider this slight amendment to the famous phrase with which he galvanises boxing crowds the world over: . ‘Let’s get ready to grumble.’ Watch Froch-Groves 11 live on Sky Sports Box Office on Saturday night, at £16.95.

"Ian Semmons, 65, was forced to spend nine hours in a 'cupboard' at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital because of a bed crisis . A pensioner was forced to spend all night in a storeroom at one of the country's flagship hospitals because all the wards were full. Ian Semmons, 65, was stunned when a porter told him he was being taken to a 'cupboard' at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. Having arrived with a serious infection, he claims he was repeatedly disturbed by staff going into the cramped room to get bandages, dressings and other kit. He said his ordeal was made worse when he had to endure 27 hours nil by mouth before he was taken to theatre for urgent surgery. Mr Semmons, who set up the national charity Action on Pain 16 years ago, said: 'This just isn't good enough. I'd be embarrassed if I was in charge of this hospital.' His claims come just days after the Norfolk and Norwich hosptial's chief executive, Anna Dugdale, admitted she would not want her mother treated there as staff are stretched to breaking point. A&E admissions at the hospital are almost 10 per cent higher this year compared to the same period last year, having shot up to 68,000 this year. The 953-bed hospital opened in 2001 under the PFI scheme, costing £229m. It is one of the largest hospitals in the UK in terms of in-patient capacity. Ms Dugdale admitted that drastic bed shortages at the 13-year-old hospital had forced staff to use makeshift wards in a desperate bid to cope with a flood of admissions. He said: 'I wouldn't choose this for my mum, but I wouldn't want her in the car park either. 'I would want her in the hospital. It's really tough for everybody. 'We are not able to do everything we would like to do for every patient at the moment and that makes me very sad. 'Our ability to accommodate all our patients depends on how many people turn up and how many people we can get out of the back doors.' Mr Semmons, of Shipdham, near Dereham, Norfolk, said he now plans to complain to the healthcare regulator, the Care Quality Commission, about his ordeal. He had gone to the hospital on July 2 for a routine procedure, which was carried out as an outpatient appointment. But a few days later, he began feeling unwell and on the weekend of July 12 and 13, he was referred by a GP to the hospital with a high temperature. He claims he spent four hours in the acute medical unit before being seen by a doctor, who set he had a serious infection and needed to be admitted. 'At 2.30am a porter came through and said we were going to Cringleford ward and he said I was going in the cupboard.' In total, he spent five days at the hospital before being discharged. Mr Semmons said: 'They called it a treatment room, but it served as a storage area and the room had no windows and only had bright lights . He said: 'The treatment was fabulous, but this incident shows that things are going wrong. 'The nurses on the ward were superb, but they were placed in an impossible situation.' The father-of-two said he was taken to the storeroom in a ward at about 2.30am on July 14. Mr Semmons claims he was forced to stay there until a bed on the ward finally became free at about 11am. He said: 'They called it a treatment room, but it served as a storage area and the room had no windows and only had bright lights. 'There was no privacy at all. The nurses were coming in quite often and were very apologetic,' he said. 'They had to move my bed at times to get to the supplies. The fact they gave me a complaints form when I arrived on the ward shows the situation is totally out of control.' A hospital spokesman said treatment rooms were used for extra bed space as 'escalation areas' when hospital wards were full. The hospital's chief executive, Anna Dugdale, recently admitted she wouldn't want her own mother treated there . Late last month, Anna Dugdale, chief executive of  Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital spoke out as services reached breaking point due to a catastrophic rise in patients. Ms Dugdale said drastic bed shortages at the 13-year-old hospital had forced staff to use makeshift wards in a desperate bid to cope with a flood of admissions. The crisis is getting worse all the time because the rural region has a growing, ageing population and patients are staying in hospital longer. Coupled with a rise in A&E admissions - which have rocketed from 54,000 in 2008-09 to 68,000 this year - exhausted staff are said to be under immense pressure. Ms Dugdale, hospital chief executive since 2008, admitted: 'I wouldn't choose this for my mum, but I wouldn't want her in the car park either. I would want her in the hospital. 'It's really tough for everybody. I do this job as I'm proud of what we do and I love it. 'We are not able to do everything we would like to do for every patient at the moment and that makes me very sad. 'Our ability to accommodate all our patients depends on how many people turn up and how many people we can get out of the back doors.' Ms Dugdale said there were 'all sorts of options' but insisted that she would never turn patients away from her 953-bed hospital. The huge level of demand for care has forced the use of non-ward areas for bed space - including makeshift wards in the medical school. The dialysis unit and clinical teaching spaces are also used when the hospital is full to capacity. In 2010, pensioner Rhoda Talbot, 85, had to spend a night in a storeroom at the Norfolk and Norwich. Mr Semmons added: 'This [shows this] has been going on for four and a half years. 'I'd have thought they'd have come up with a solution in that period of time. 'To put the blame entirely on outside factors is disingenuous and there is a lot you can do at the hospital,' insisted Mr Semmons. 'Four and a half years and they are still content to put someone in a cupboard or what they call a treatment room. 'It is totally unacceptable and it is quite ridiculous.' The spokesman said: 'At the time that Mr Semmons came to hospital we were already fully occupied caring for other patients. 'We do not, however, turn away patients who need emergency admission. 'If necessary, when all our wards are full and more patients need our care, we implement an escalation plan and care for patients in what are known as escalation areas.

"Roberto Mancini has only been in charge of Inter Milan for two weeks and the new coach is already itching for the January transfer window. Mancini complained that he had the wrong players for the system he wanted to play after his side went down 4-2 at Roma on Sunday, leaving them in 11th place in Serie A with only four wins from 13 games.

We've now got a month to do what we can, then we'll see,' said Mancini, who was sent off for dissent during the match. 'We need to improve quickly,' A new centre forward is likely to be top of Mancini's list after Rodrigo Palacio, partnering Dani Osvaldo in attack in place of the rested Mauro Icardi, again failed to hit the target. The Argentinian forward has not yet scored this season. 'The defeat doesn't change our ideas,' said Mancini, who has ditched predecessor Walter Mazzarri's three-man defence and given Colombia midfielder Fredy Guarin a more attacking role. 'We knew it wasn't going to be perfect straight away, but we need to adapt to the new system quickly. Colombia midfielder Fredy Guarin a more attacking role for Inter Milan since Mancini took over . Mancini on giving the 28-year-old a new role: 'I think Guarin's most natural position is as a creative midfielder' 'I think Guarin's most natural position is as a creative midfielder, but he has to understand when to go it alone and when to move the ball on. 'Osvaldo played well. Icardi wasn't dropped - we're playing every three days so it's completely normal to rotate two great strikers like those two.' Mancini said that qualifying for the Champions League, which would require a third-place finish, remained his target. 'We can win back the points in the league,' said Mancini, whose side are six points behind Genoa in third place. 'We have to keep working, one defeat doesn't change absolutely anything.'

"A former homeless crack addict who found fame four years ago after a YouTube video catapulted him to overnight fame has revealed that he is broke despite a six-figure book deal and a voice over contract with Kraft. Ted ‘Gold Voice’ Williams became a media sensation when he was filmed panhandling in Columbus, Ohio in December 2010 with a sign reading: 'I'm an ex-radio announcer who has fallen on hard times'. The once-successful DJ was recorded performing a voice-over by a local reporter and the video went viral, receiving more than 20 million views on YouTube. Scroll down for video . Ted ‘Gold Voice’ Williams, a former homeless crack addict who found fame four years ago after a YouTube video of him went viral, has said he is broke despite a $375,000 book deal in 2012 . With his story garnering national coverage, Williams found himself with a home, radio job offers - and money for the first time since he had moved into a tent in the woods 17 year earlier as an addiction to crack cocaine took over his life. The notoriety that followed his amazing comeback led to numerous voice-over jobs, including one as the spokesman for Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. Two stints in rehab have helped him deal with first his cocaine abuse and then issues with alcohol, but problems remain in his life. 'I should have been a millionaire by now,' he told The Columbus Dispatch after a recent appearance on a Marion, Ohio, radio station, where he has a weekly show. Williams became a media sensation when he was filmed panhandling in Columbus, Ohio in December 2010 with a sign reading: 'I'm an ex-radio announcer who has fallen on hard times' Inspiration: Williams now spends part of his time visiting homeless shelters and offering support to other people in the position that he once found himself . Despite receiving a $375,000 book advance for a biography, A Golden Voice: How Faith, Hard Work, And Humility Brought Me From The Streets To Salvation, Williams admits he is broke. 'I own nothing,' he said, adding that he doesn't have furniture or a car. The situation was very different in 2011 when Williams first found fame and lived in hotels paid for by an agent. After that he moved into a rented condominium owned by another agent, but now he lives in an apartment and admits he owns no furniture. ‘Financially I'm a little under the weather. I lot of things I signed in 2011 I  probably shouldn't have signed,’ he said. Williams admits he ‘wasn't focused’ and ‘trusted too much’ in managers who he now believes didn't have his best interests at heart. He now says his Christian faith has helped him cope with his resentment and anger about what has happened. 'I’m still very fragile in my recovery,' he said. In the 1980s, Williams had been a successful radio show host on a top-rated morning show in Columbus, but then he slid into a life of homelessness and drug abuse for 17 years and lived in a tent . In the 1980s, Williams had been a successful radio show host on a top-rated morning show in Columbus, but then he slid into a life of homelessness and drug abuse for 17 years until the YouTube video gave him a second chance. Williams has had other struggles since 2010 and initially turned to alcohol. 'I figured since it wasn’t my drug of choice, alcohol could be my new drug,' Williams told the Today show in 2012. 'I could go and start drinking, and nobody would know. Everybody would know [if] Ted was on crack, but they wouldn’t know that Ted was drinking.' When he appeared on the Today show he had just achieved one year of sobriety and was celebrating by walking his daughter down the aisle at her wedding. 'I was able to be a part of that, something that a year and a half ago I wouldn’t have even thought about, let alone become a part of,' he said.

"A teenage girl's weight dropped to just six stone after careless name-calling caused her to be gripped by anorexia. In the space of a year, Deanna Carter, 17, lost four stone and three dress sizes after she was called 'thunder thighs'. The student, from Gloucester, has since recovered, gaining weight and is now a healthy nine stone. She is now keen for others to learn from her ordeal. Scroll down for video . Deanna Carter, 17, dropped to six stone, left and right, and was just weeks from death after a family member called her 'thunder thighs', in what she describes as a 'daft little joke' The comment resonated with Deanna, pictured before anorexia took hold, and she feel into a deep depression . 'One of my family members called me ""thunder thighs"", she said. 'When they said it, they were just being silly - it was a daft little joke.' Despite being innocent, throw away comments, they resonated with Deanna. They provoked a deep depression, and manifested as voices in her head. She said: 'It was a psychological problem for sure. It was every minute of every day. I went into a depression. I couldn't be bothered with life any more.' The teenager became addicted to pro-anorexia websites, scouring them everyday. She said: 'I was addicted. It was my Facebook.' Soon after, she began forcing herself to be sick, to speed her weight loss. She said: 'It was something that I discovered one day. I did it every time I ate. It seemed like a natural way to get rid of it.' By the time she dropped below seven stone, she began to experience heart palpitations. At this point the joking had stopped and her family were becoming concerned, but Deanna remained in denial about her worsening health. She said: 'I was so fearful, I thought I was big when I wasn't. I was in denial, I thought it was normal. I would have rather died than become fat.' At her lowest weight, the teenager weighed just six stone and wore size four clothing. Deanna, pictured left at her lowest weight, and right, on the road to recovery,said: 'One of my family members called me 'thunder thighs'. When they said it they were just being silly - it was a daft little joke' She added: 'It was a psychological problem, for sure. It was every minute of every day. I went into a depression. I couldn't be bothered with life any more' Under the insistence of her mother, Tracey, Deanna was eventually admitted to the Gloucester Royal Hospital before being moved to the Cotswold Recovery Spa, where doctors told her that if she continued to starve she would be dead in weeks. Deanna's family, including her five siblings, rallied around her to encourage her to get better. She said: 'If I bring up my weight now, my brothers  tell me to not be stupid. Many people tell me that they didn't think I was fat before all this.' The teenager catalogued her year from hell in her diary entitled titled: 'An Unexpected Illness' which shows how the seemingly harmless jibes caused her life to snowball out of control. Her condition resulted in her missing her first year of sixth form, but she has since returned to study business and drama and has ambitions of being an actress. Her mother Ms Carter, 42, said: 'I'm relieved that Deanna was able to get the support she needed. She's still on the mend, but the support worker and therapists have been absolutely brilliant. 'I'm happy that we're not in the place we were last year. It was very difficult for all of us.' The charity beat provides  support for people with eating disorders.

"This is the image Iran is using to justify their detention of a London law graduate. Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, has been held in custody since June 30 for 'propaganda against the regime' after trying to watch a men's volleyball match, which women in Iran are banned from attending. The group of fellow women's rights campaigners she was  with took this photograph when they were prevented from entering the Azadi stadium, in Tehran. This is the photograph Iranian authorities claim justifies their detention of Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, (circled) Miss Ghavami, pictured with her mother, Susan Moshtaghian, 49, who has also gone on a hunger strike in protest against her daughter's detention in Iran . Miss Ghavami was questioned for four hours after being arrested for trying to enter the stadium in the Iranian capital. She had believed she could watch the match because reports had suggested the restriction on women mingling with male spectators at sports facilities had been relaxed. The 25-year-old graduate from SOAS, part of the University of London, was released but rearrested days later when she tried to collect her belongings from a police station and officers discovered dual citizenship. Miss Ghavami was only told on September 23 that she was formally charged with ‘propaganda against the regime’ – a charge that carries a possible prison term of several years. Her case is due to be heard by Tehran’s notorious revolutionary court. Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, from London, (above) has been refusing food in defiance of her detainment at Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison where she has been held since her arrest in June for ‘propaganda against the regime’ To mark 100 days since she was jailed, Miss Ghavami has now gone on a hunger strike. Miss Ghavami’s mother, Susan Moshtaghian, 49, told the Guardian that she too had gone on hunger strike and was increasingly worried about her daughter’s condition. ‘I am extremely concerned about Ghoncheh’s health and life. I hold [the] authorities fully responsible for any harm inflicted on my daughter,’ she said. Ms Moshtaghian, from London, was allowed to visit her daughter for the first time in 19 days on Saturday. ‘She told me she has been on hunger strike since 1 October as objection to her uncertain conditions and 100 days of temporary custody with no basis,’ she said. ‘I am restless since I heard about this and I have also gone on hunger strike. I stayed silent for 82 days in the hope that my daughter comes back home safely. 'Now I am worried about her life and will not stop until she’s free.’ Miss Ghavami’s brother, Iman, 28, said his sister had lost weight since she has been imprisoned and was visibly thinner when her parents visited. He said he was 'extremely concerned' about her health. ‘People die from hunger strike. It’s a very serious situation and it’s been five days now,’ he said. Since her arrest, the London graduate has been allowed minimal contact with her family. The law graduate from SOAS, part of the University of London, has been held for 100 days after being arrested in June for trying to watch a men’s sports game in Tehran which women in Iran are banned from attending . A petition started by Mr Ghavami on the site Change.org has so far collected more than 528,000 signatures. David Cameron and Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond have raised the matter with their Iranian counterparts. But as Iran does not recognise dual nationality, diplomatic efforts are limited. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, was questioned about Miss Ghavami’s detention on Christiane Amanpour’s CNN show in September. He said: ‘According to our laws [she is an Iranian citizen] only, we do not accept dual citizenship, but the bottom line is our aim is for the laws to be respected every step of the way.’ An FCO spokeswoman said: ‘We are concerned about the detention of Miss Ghoncheh Ghavami, a dual British-Iranian national in Iran. 'We are in touch with her family. We have raised our concerns with the Iranian government and asked for more information about her welfare and the charges against her.' Ms Ghavami, 25, is being held in solitary confinement at Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison (pictured)","Iranian authorities release image to justify detention of London graduate .

Hero: Pogba makes no secret of the fact he wants to play like Andrea Pirlo as he progresses in the game . What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman? Because of the age I started playing I have never thought about that question, and as I am about to go and play in a World Cup I am glad that I have never had to think about that question. Career highlight? I can’t choose between the two league titles with Juventus and winning my first international cap forFrance. They were both very special. ... and the worst moment? My time at Manchester United. Of course when you are at such a big club you understand you need to be patient for your chance, but I did not feel respected or valued as a player or a man. If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save? I know it is an obvious answer, but just my family. I don’t have one material possession that means that much to me.

Not just because they make good music - but they are an inspiration for young black men all over the world. Inspiration: Pogba is a fan of American rapper Jay Z . What is the one programme on TV you can’t miss? I prefer to play video games, but I do like to watch the highlights from the NBA. Last film you saw? The Wolf Of Wall Street and it was incredible. If you could have dinner with three famous people, who would they be? Zinedine Zidane, Jay Z, and Usain Bolt. Can you cook? Best dish? I can do easy things like pasta with chicken or pasta with fish, but in Italy you just need to walk out the door and you can have the best pasta in the world cooked for you. Your favourite holiday destination? I like to be where it is warm and have got even more used to the heat being in Italy, so I would choose somewhere like Miami Beach. In a film of your life, who would you like to play you? A young Will Smith would be a great honour. Tell us a secret... Both of my twin brothers represent the Guinea national team.

"A mother has spoken of her disgust after discovering her eight-year-old son was sent a string of sexually explicit messages while playing a children's computer game. Chantal Absolom was horrified when her son began receiving the comments from other players while using the internet game MovieStarPlanet on the family's laptop. The 32-year-old from Brighton fears the messages were written by adults as some of the language used was so explicit. Scroll down for video . Chantal Bolsom's eight-year-old son was playing MovieStarPlanet when she stumbled upon a thread of comments titled 'dirt story' One of the comments asked the eight-year-old whether he would like to go 'on a date'. MovieStarPlanet describes itself as a game for children aged between eight and 15 where users can create their own characters and films. Among its features are online chat rooms where players can exchange messages. 'I was shocked and horrified when I saw the messages,' said Mrs Absolom. 'It's very creepy, worrying and seems to be a hotbed for sexual conversation from children, and maybe adults pretending to be younger. 'There is no way some of the comments were written by children judging by the language used in the comments. 'I think people need to know the dangers and we shouldn't turn a blind eye, we should do something about it.' The mother spotted the messages under a forum listed 'dirty story'. In the thread of comments, details of sexual encounters between young teenagers are described and reference was made to a 13-year-old girl who lived with an 'inappropriate uncle'. MovieStarPlanet offers users and parents extensive advice as to how to stay safe online, with the website's terms and conditions telling players not to post 'sexual or racist' comments. The game allows users to create their own characters and movies and share their favourite elements with other players .

Mrs Absolom added: 'Clearly I should have studied the website more but I thought it was an innocent kids' game.' Vernon Jones, head of safety at the Denmark based company MovieStarPlanet, apologised for the concern caused. He said inappropriate posts were cleared from the UK forums and word filters were updated. Mr Jones added: 'The safety of children using the online community is of paramount concern.

A 27-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman, both from Valley View in Adelaide, are expected to appear at the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Monday. Malaysian authorities surrendered the pair on Friday after they had been held in the country for the customary 60 days following their arrest. Australian police Police  said the parents have been charged with the aggravated unlawful removal of a child from a jurisdiction. Scroll down for video . A South Australian couple have been extradited to Adelaide after being arrested in Malaysia for allegedly kidnapping their two-year-old son and fleeing the country in August, Chief Superintendent John Venditto revealed . In accordance with South Australian law, the offence could see them sentenced to a prison term of up to 19 years. The two-year-old boy was flown back to Adelaide in the company of two Families SA social workers and placed into the care of Families SA on August 10 after a routine health check. He was under the guardianship of the Minister for Education and Child Development, but lived with his grandparents when he was allegedly abducted.

Chief Superintendent John Venditto said at a press conference that the entire operation took only six days from the moment police were informed that the child was missing until the arrest of his parents. 'It is an extraordinarily quick and rapid response to something that would generally take a lot longer,' he said. The parents could face up to 19 years in jail according to South Australian law, while the grandparents, who have also been charged, are expected to appear at the Holden Hill Magistrates court (pictured) in October . Chief Inspector Tony Crameri, the officer in charge of the investigation, said the child's well-being was the priority throughout the operation. 'This was an incredibly delicate investigation and we were mindful that the parents could flee at any moment with the boy to an unknown location,' he said. 'Such a quick and positive outcome could not have been achieved without the cooperation of a number national and international agencies, including Interpol, the Royal Malaysian Police, Malaysian Government, Commonwealth Attorney Generals Department, Department of Foreign Affairs, South Australia DPP and the Australian Federal Police,' he said. Meanwhile, the toddler's grandparents have been granted bail and are set to appear in the Holden Hill Magistrates Court on 14 October. Their charges could also lead to a lengthy jail sentence, according to police.

"Wojciech Szczesny has been pictured with his FA Cup medal and hugging the famous trophy despite not playing a single second in the FA Cup this season. Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper had to play second fiddle throughout the tournament to Lukasz Fabianski, but took his place among the bench at Wembley for Saturday's dramatic win over Hull. The Poland keeper, who shared the 'Golden Glove' award with Petr Cech after 16 clean sheets in the Premier League this term, stormed the pitch to celebrate with his team-mates before leading the celebrations during Arsenal's open-top bus parade 24 hours later.

Centre of attention: The Poland stopper takes hold of the megaphone as Arsenal celebrate their trophy triumph . But after nine long years without a trophy at Arsenal you would not begrudge anyone at the north London club celebrating their Cup triumph. The Gunners almost blew their chance to win Saturday's final after Hull took a surprise 2-0 lead with just eight minutes of the game gone. But Arsene Wenger's side bounced back through a Santi Cazorla free-kick before Laurent Koscielny equalised after 71 minutes. Aaron Ramsey then scored the winner with 11 minutes remaining of extra-time remaining.

We've done it: Szczesny celebrates Arsenal's victory againt Hull with team-mate Olivier Giroud . Smiles better: Szczesny takes a selfie at the Emirates as thousands of Arsenal fans turn out for their parade . 'It will force you first to be a bit more creative in the press conferences, but I trust you will be, I don't worry too much for that,' said Wenger on ending their trophyless streak. 'I have nothing against this question if you say that in the other clubs as well, there are some clubs who haven't won for 20 years and they don't get this question at all. 'But basically, the whole club and the . fans were under that kind of pressure for not having won for years, but . that will help to get that off our shoulders a little bit and focus on . getting stronger.' Proud day: Szczesny hugs Arsene Wenger (left) and with his girlfriend Marina Luczenko and the FA Cup . Wenger revealed he intends to sort out his new contract in the coming weeks. 'Yes (it will be done), because I go to Brazil on the 10th of June,' he said. Arsenal, though, still have to resolve whether full-back Bacary Sagna will remain, the France defender's deal set to expire this summer with Manchester City a possible destination, before they can look to bring in new recruits. 'First, we have to wait for Sagna - what will he do? - and (goalkeeper Lukasz) Fabianski. After, we have to bring in two or three players to strengthen the squad that is for sure,' said Wenger. 'Unfortunately, everywhere we go, there are many teams on the market at the moment.'","Wojciech Szczesny hasn't played for Arsenal in the FA Cup this season .

Google Now will make a note of flights you search for and alerts you when they change in price. File picture . The service that already voluntarily offers people information about the their journey and upcoming appointments will make a note of any flight searches you make and let you know when the price of that journey changes. How it looks: Google Now will send price alerts to your smartphone . For example, if you search for a flight from London to New York in October, Google will monitor the prices and alert you via Google Now if the price drops. While other services such as Airfare Watchdog have flight alerts, Google's offering is instant, making it more convenient and less time consuming. But here's the catch. So far, the service - snappily titled the 'flight price monitor card' only works when holidaymakers search using Google Flights to search in the first instance. So customers searching using other travel search engines such a Kayak, Skyscanner or Travel Supermarket cannot make use of the alerts. To start using the feature, you'd need to browse Google Flights to trigger it. Google Now previously displayed flight information based on confirmation emails, but as of now it will automatically monitor prices for flight searches done on Google Flights. In May, Google announced that smartphones using its Google Now service will be offering something known as a ‘parking detector’. The intelligent personal assistant, available within the Google Search mobile application for the Android and iOS operating systems, lists the address of the place where you last left your car.

"You don't normally expect to be in the middle of a scrum at an event in aid of a charity. A nightclub or student disco maybe, but not at a charity ball. But that's exactly what happened to me this week – when I attended a ball in aid of the NSPCC at the Hurlingham Club in Chelsea. The very genteel Hurlingham Club is one of the most beautiful sports clubs in the country, built in 42 acres of the most prime real estate in the world, just south of Chelsea down near the river, but I didn't realise what the exact nature of the event was at first. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Spencer attended an NSPCC charity ball this week but wasn't prepared for the hoards of teenage fans . The trick for this would be to thoroughly read the invite, as it was clearly stated that this was a ball for under 16s. But I rarely read the instructions on anything, so it came as a bit of a surprise when I walked through the door and I was surrounded by about 200 very excitable young women, all of whom wanted a selfie. Everywhere I went there was a cluster of well-spoken girls in Little Black Dresses waving smartphones at me. Spencer managed to pose for one picture alone outside the event . Spencer posed for endless selfies with his fans when arriving at the ball . Spencer says that the ball was filled with well spoken girls in black dresses . You can see from the video below the sort of numbers in the herd of young girls. What is the collective noun for a group of teenage girls? A 'giggle' of girls I believe. Clearly I was more than happy to accommodate as they all asked very politely but it felt like I was lost at sea with the crowd choosing where I went. Spencer posed for further pictures in the back of a London taxi which was converted into a photo booth . The event helped to raise over £20,000 for the charity . For health and safety reasons the organisers ended up putting me in a specially designed London taxi which had been converted into a photo booth, and it seemed like an hour passed by having girls (and occasionally some boys) ushered in and out of the taxi. But deep down I loved the attention – and they were all really charming and polite, I simply couldn't refuse and I think it's fair to say that anyone who asked for an picture got one, and in some cases five or six. And of course the most important thing was the event raised over £20,000 for the very good cause of the NSPCC, protecting vulnerable children all over the UK, and preventing abuse.

"A former treasurer and head of tax for Morrisons has been charged with insider dealing over Ocado share trades, according to the City regulator. Paul Gerard Coyle, 50, has been charged by the Financial Conduct Authority with two counts of insider dealing related to shares in the online grocery delivery service between February and May 2013. He was  reportedly arrested in Harrogate in December last year in a dawn raid by the FCA and Yorkshire police and suspended by Morrisons in January. Former treasurer and head of tax for Morrisons, Paul Gerard Coyle, 50, has been charged by the Financial Conduct Authority with two counts of insider dealing related to Ocado share trading . The FCA was able to prosecute under the Criminal Justice Act 1993. A £200million partnership between the two companies was announced in May, which sent Ocado shares surging. The budget supermarket signed a 25-year deal with Ocado to acquire its distribution centre in Dordon, Warwickshire, and use its technology. Morrisons has used Ocado's technological know-how to make its belated debut in internet deliveries, which finally began in January this year. Ocado's share price lifted by more than 500 per cent in 2013 following the £200million deal with Morrisons . In 2013 Ocado's share price lifted by more than 500 per cent. Those convicted of insider trading can face up to 20 years in prison and significant fines. Morrisons shares are currently trading down by 2 per cent at 167.40p. In a statement, Morrisons said the FCA's insider dealing investigation 'did not concern Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc nor any other Morrisons' employee'. The supermarket said: 'Morrisons is satisfied with its governance and procedures concerning the handling of market sensitive data in this case and found that the company's procedures had been properly followed. 'These accusations, if proven, would be the result of an individual acting alone.'

"A three year old was left alone in a pre-school for almost two hours after staff forgot to take her on a class trip to the woods. The girl's parents said they were extremely concerned when they learnt of the incident because the toddler has a pre-existing condition which affects the structure of her skull and makes her incredibly vulnerable if she falls or has an accident. Staff at Sydling Springs Pre-School, in Sydling St Nicholas, Dorset, did not notice the child, who is not being identified, was missing until they returned to the building from the trip to nearby woods. An Ofsted inspection following the incident found that registers were not being completed properly, meaning staff had no accurate record of the number of children being taken on trips. Sydling St Nicholas Village Hall, where the three year old was left to run around the pre-school . While her classmates were out the child had the run of the village hall school. Her mother said it was extremely lucky her daughter was not harmed during the incident that happened on September 22 this year. The child's mother, who has two other children, said: 'There was a very small group of children there. How could they have missed her? 'We are really grateful that she wasn't hurt, but who knows what could have happened. 'If she had fallen or hit her head it could have been catastrophic. I just don't want it to happen again.' She added: 'I have received a letter from the pre-school committee which says they will be investigating the incident but that any disciplinary action taken will not be divulged to us because of confidentiality. Headquarters of Dorset County Council where councillors say they are helping the school address the issue . The woman made a complaint to Ofsted which carried out an unannounced inspection days later. Inspectors found that there were no risk assessments in place ahead of such trips and that registers were not completed correctly to provide an accurate record of the number of children present. No member of staff at the pre-school has lost their job over it. Ofsted inspectors have served the pre-school with a welfare requirement notice, which demands they introduce a series measures to ensure there is no repeat of the incident. This is enforceable by law. One of those is to ensure that while children are on and off the premises they are accounted for at all times. Hannah Tippett, chairman of Sydling Springs Pre-School, said the staff involved in the incident remained in their positions. She said: 'Following Ofsted's recommendations and results of the pre-school committee's own internal investigation, the pre-school immediately implemented measures to ensure such an incident cannot re-occur. 'We take this opportunity to thank parents for their incredible ongoing support at this time.' According the Ofsted's most recent routine inspection report, the pre-school caters for a maximum of 22 children. A spokesman for Dorset County Council said: 'The pre-school leader of Sydling Springs contacted the council's early years team with a report of a safeguarding issue. 'So far, we have supported Sydling Springs by helping them address the actions set out in Ofsted's compliance notice. We have also put in place a number of actions for the pre-school to adopt to ensure this never happens again.'","Three-year-old girl was left alone in Dorset pre-school after staff forgot  her .

"Hospital are to carry out Ebola drills this weekend to ensure they are well prepared to deal with infected patients. Simulation exercises are taking place in at least two major trusts – one in the north, one in the south – although others may be instructed to follow suit. At each, an actor will pretend to be a patient struck down with the virus and staff will have to act quickly to ensure it doesn’t spread. Yesterday A&E units across the country were given guidelines telling them to have specialist protective clothing on standby including masks, goggles and gowns. Yesterday A&E units across the UK were given guidelines telling them to have specialist protective clothing on standby including masks, goggles and gowns in case of an Ebola outbreak. Pictured, Liberian nurses in protective clothing preparing bodies of victims of Ebola for burial in the isolation unit of a hospital in Monrovia . The drills will likely take place at a hospital with a specialist infectious disease department, such as the Royal Free in North London (pictured) Yet staff at some hospitals say they haven’t yet received these even though they should have been delivered within the past few months. As part of the drills, the mock patient will turn up at a GP surgery or an A&E unit with mock early symptoms including a fever, muscle ache and sickness. Doctors are meant to ask ‘have you travelled recently?’ and if the patient has been to countries such as Sierra Leone, Guinea or Liberia – immediately suspect they have Ebola. Staff will quickly put on protective clothing and the patient will be taken by ambulance to the hospital where the drill is taking place. Once they have been dropped off, the ambulance will be thoroughly decontaminated with a powerful chemical called hypochlorite – comprised of chlorine and oxygen . All staff across the trust will have been warned beforehand that the drill is taking place by email and text alerts. But many may only get a few hours’ notice – especially those working on other wards or in the canteen who won't be directly involved. As part of the drills, the mock patient will turn up at a GP surgery or an A&E unit with mock early symptoms including a fever, muscle ache and sickness. Several paramedics wearing protective suits as they move Spanish missionary Miguel Pajares, who later died from Ebola . Health workers in Skopje, Macedonia, outside the hospital where the British man died of what is believed to be Ebola . The Ebola outbreak has killed thousands in West Africa and has spread to North America and Europe . Patients and relatives will also be informed that an exercise is under way – although they may not necessarily say that it is an ‘Ebola drill’ just in case it creates a sense of panic. The Department of Health – which is overseeing the drills – will not to disclose which hospitals they are taking place so as not to alarm the public and to keep it as realistic as possible. But they will most probably take place at one of four which has a specialist infectious disease department. These include the Royal Free in North London, The Royal Liverpool, the Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield and the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne. Throughout the drill, officials will be checking that staff are taking all the appropriate steps to prevent the spread of the virus – and minimise panic amongst the general public. The patient will be transferred to a make-shift isolation unit which will involve a tent being set up around the bed to contain the infection, whilst still enabling the patient to breath. The Royal Free has the country’s only high level isolation unit – with just two beds – and air is specially filtered to prevent the spread of the infection. Writing for the The New York Times, Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy a the University of Minnesota, said those experts are loath to discuss their concerns in public, for fear of whipping up hysteria. Discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak, he said: 'The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.' But the chair of the UK's Health Protection Agency, Professor David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene of Tropical Medicine, said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate. He said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the Ebola virus will change over time. Pointing to the example of the H1N1 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009, Dr Osterholm said: 'If certain mutations occurred, it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola.' But Professor Heymann, told MailOnline: 'No one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus. 'I would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus. 'The virus's epidemiology is consistent with transmission via bodily secretions and excretions, which is exactly the same as other past epidemics. But last month three other trusts, the Royal Liverpool, the Royal Hallamshire and the Royal Victoria were instructed to make contingency plans in case there was a sudden surge of patients. These are likely to have included setting up make-shift isolation units. Public health officials in the nearby area will also work out how best to alert members of the public who may have come into contact with the patient without causing mass panic. Ministers agreed to carry out the drills during Wednesday’s Cobra chaired by David Cameron. The exact details are still being finalised by the Department of Health including at how many trusts they will take place and on which day, Saturday or Sunday.","Two major trusts - one in the north and one in the south - to test response .

"A Melbourne teenager remains in an induced coma after he was struck in an alleged one-punch attack, resulting from a road rage incident while out with friends on Halloween. Diane Toulson says her 16 year old son, Brock, was 'king hit' while walking home from a Halloween party in Knoxfield, in Melbourne's south east, and was taken to Melbourne's Alfred hospital with a brain bleed. 'I think we are very lucky that Brock's alive,' she told 3AW. 'He was hit once. He did go straight to the ground. We were very lucky there was a person behind so his head actually landed on his foot instead of the concrete pavement.' Brock Toulson (pictured) who is the victim of an alleged one-punch on Halloween is currently in a critical but stable condition at Melbourn'e Alfred hospital. He has a fractured skull and nose . Overseas at the time of the attack, Ms Toulson had to cut her holiday short and try to get back to Australia. She wrote on her facebook account, ' I am scared and panicked. Please send him everything you have.' She said her son and two other friends had been drinking before they left the party at Knoxsville and were attacked by a man driving past. Ms Toulson told Fairfax radio a car swerved at them before her son yelled out 'you're an idiot', and the driver jumped out and punched Brock in the face. He was then taken to Alfred hospital in a serious condition, his current condition is critical but stable. When Daily Mail contacted, Brock's brother, Cory, he said the family wanted to keep comments to a minimal and concentrate efforts on providing Brock the support he needed. 'I will say he is stable and we're working towards getting him into a better position, but it's a long road to recovery and we have a very difficult time ahead,' said Cory. An update on Ms Toulson's facebook page on Sunday said Brock was stable and that his injuries were under control. 'The current problem is he is too aggressive to wake up which they say is normal after sustaining this type of injury and severe concussion,' she said. Melbourne teenager Brock Toulson is recovering in Melbourne's Alfred hospital (pictured) in a critical but stable condition . 'He has a few fractures in skull that will repair naturally, a fractured nose and a few brain bleeds but they are under control.' She also thanked staff at the hospital saying they were fantastic and that he was being well cared for. 'We are strategising on how to wake him up tomorrow and the next few weeks will see if there will be any ongoing or permanent damage.' 'We are just glad he is ok and will work towards getting him back on his feet and functioning.' Police confirmed that at 11:20pm on Friday, the driver, a 47 year old man from Ferntree Gully fronted up to the Knox police station soon after the incident, which occurred at the intersection of Scoresby Road and Camden Park Drive, Ferntree Gully. The man advised police he had just been involved in an altercation, where he confronted two youths allegedly tagging a bus stop. Police say the man was interviewed in relation to the assault but was released pending further inquiries. The disturbing incident came just a night before new laws were put into effect to mandate higher sentences for fatal one punch attacks. One-punch killers face at least 10 years in prison for manslaughter if they punch a victim to the head and it results in death. Police are also urging any witnesses who have any information regarding Friday's incident to contact Crime Stoppers.","Melbourne teenager, Brock Toulson, 16, was the victim of an alleged one-punch attack after leaving a Halloween party .

"The Americans have a saying about rematches: second time around is a rhubarb. Mostly, they are right. Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank — British boxing’s historic precursor to Froch-Groves II at Wembley on Saturday night — came close to filling Old Trafford, but that return bout fell as flat as a cowpat on a muddy field. Ready to go: Carl Froch and George Groves' rematch takes place at Wembley this Saturday . Occasionally, as with the Thrilla in Manila, our transatlantic cousins will grudgingly concede to a  rematch being a ‘barn-burner’. Carl Froch took part in one of those when he exacted revenge over Mikkel Kessler a year ago. The 80,000 ticket-buyers for Wembley Stadium and the million projected to pay to watch on Sky will be comforted to know that the Nottingham Cobra expects this one to be even more thrilling. But for the most part, rematches are more bones of contention than nights of high drama. Froch-Groves II is no exception. The public tend to clamour for second helpings and Groves roared as loudly as the fans for his chance of a second shot at Froch after his somewhat premature stoppage loss in November. Froch smiles wryly at being ordered by the IBF — whose world super-middleweight title he holds — to oblige his young challenger. The irony is not lost on him that Groves has insisted on deleting from the multi-million-pound contract a clause providing for a third fight in the event that he wins this time. Froch says: ‘Accidents can happen in the ring but it’s interesting that George won’t offer me another rematch if he gets lucky. And while I’m fighting him again he never gave a second chance to Kenny Anderson.’ Not on: Groves was distraught after his first world title fight with Froch was stopped in Manchester last year . That is a reference to the Commonwealth super-middleweight title fight in 2010 to which Anderson came as a late substitute with a few days’ training. Anderson shocked Groves with an early knockdown before being stopped in the sixth round. His calls for a rematch with time to prepare went unheeded. Groves can argue Anderson lapsed into amphetamine use soon after. But that remains the only defeat on the Scot’s 19-fight record; he has since won the British title. Another fight between them would not have reached the magnitude that is gripping the nation this weekend. Can Froch-Groves II live up to expectations, equal or surpass the excitement of five months ago? Intense: Both men are confident they will knock the other out at Wembley Stadium . Both men believe so. Groves says: ‘This will be a great fight, even if it is one Carl cannot win in the end. I will knock him out in the third.’ Froch says: ‘George is getting stopped. Probably in the mid-to-late rounds but sooner if he tries to fulfil that early prediction.’ So, come Sunday morning, to which will we be adding Froch-Groves II: the Rhubarbs or the Barn-Burners? RHUBARBS . Benn-Eubank II -  October 9, 1993, Old Trafford . After . Eubank’s stoppage of the Dark Destroyer in the first fight, the world’s . boxing fans had to wait three years for the rematch. Then they flocked . to Old Trafford  –  to be disappointed. Only the 12th  and last round . lived up to the blood and thunder of the original – and only because . both corners told their man they had to win it. Both corners were . right. It ended in an unsatisfactory draw. Disappointing: The rematch between Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank finished with a draw in Manchester . Cooper- Ali II – May 21st 1966, Highbury . Our . ‘Enery had famously floored Cassius Clay at Wembley three years earlier . with his fabled left hook and only the bell had saved The Greatest. Ali took more care in the rematch at Highbury,  waiting for Cooper’s . fragile eyes to cut again, which inevitably they did. Easier: Muhammad Ali was prepared for the threat of Henry Cooper in the rematch at Highbury in 1966 . Lewis-McCall 11 – February 7, 1997, Las Vegas Hilton . Our . Lennox had lost his world heavyweight title by a shock 2nd round KO to . McCall but the American lost his mojo in the intervening two-and-a-half . years before the rematch. In the midst of his battles with drug abuse, . McCall appeared in no fit state to fight – and refused to do so in the . fourth and fifth rounds, suffering a mental break-down and weeping . profusely in the ring. The referee had no alternative but to call a halt . in Lewis’ favour. Comfortable: Oliver McCall was past his best... the referee had to award the fight to Lennox Lewis . Ali-Frazier II – January 28, 1974, Madison Square Garden, New YorkSmokin’ Joe had inflicted Ali’s first defeat in the Fight of the Century four . years earlier. The first re-match in their trilogy was a let-down as Ali . manoeuvred his way to a staid decision. Tyson-Bruno 11 – March 16th 1996, MGM Grand Garden, Las Vegas . Our . Frank had rocked Tyson with a huge left in the second round of their . first fight seven years earlier, before being stopped in the fifth. But . Iron Mike had come raging out of prison before the rematch and our Bruno . had to go back to Vegas to defend his world heavyweight title against . The Baddest Man on The Planet. Sadly, a declining Bruno was not up to . the task, in what proved to be his last fight. He genuflected more than . 30 times on his way to the ring, visibly in a state of nervous . apprehension, and subsided against the ropes in the third round. Declining force: Frank Bruno was not up to the task against Mike Tyson in the 1996 rematch in Las Vegas . BARN-BURNERS . ALI-FRAZIER III – October 1st, 1975, Quezon City, Manilla . Although . the first rematch disappointed, the second was an epic. Promoter Don . King’s The Thrilla in Manilla was fought by these bitter foes as if it . really was a war. After 14 rounds of extraordinary courage and . punishment Smokin’ Joe was retired on his stool by trainer Eddie Futch. It materialised that The Greatest was about to be pulled out by his . trainer Angelo Dundee and Ali said: ‘This is the closest to death I have . ever been.’ That's more like it: Ali said it was the closest to death he had ever been after the Thrilla in Manilla with Frazier . HOLYFIELD-BOWE II – November 6th 1993, Caesars Palace, Las Vegas . Big . Daddy  had won a thunderous first fight, including an unbelievable 10th . round which is acclaimed as the greatest three minutes in ring history. Evander The Real Deal reclaimed the world heavyweight title a year . later in the open-air stadium temporarily erected on the car park at . Caesars Palace. If anything the second bout in their trilogy was even . more thrilling and this was rematch of two halves. Bowe again had . the best of the early rounds but the fight had to be stopped midway . through the seventh round as a para-glider calling himself Fan Man . crash-landed in the ring. Holyfield came back the stronger after a 21 . minute delay to claim an epic decision. Epic: There was a 21-minute delay in the rematch between Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe .

"Brazilian-born Portugal player Deco has been cleared of doping because of faulty testing by a Rio de Janeiro laboratory which has since been suspended from World Cup duty. The Court of Arbitration for Sport says a settlement between Deco, the Brazilian football federation and FIFA annulled his one-year ban imposed last September.

"A new report examining what went wrong during massive St Patrick's Day parties in Amherst, Massachusetts last March has blamed cops and university officials for failing to control the chaos. The University of Massachusetts failed to recognize the potential for the 'Blarney Blowout' parties to get out of hand, while police prematurely used pepper spray to disperse crowds, the report said. The report, which was released on Thursday, was the result of an investigation conducted by former Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis. Review: An image shows police detaining a student during the 'Blarney Blowout' in Amherst on St Patrick's Day last March. A report has concluded that police and university staff were not prepared for the event . It came after dozens of people, including many students, were arrested and four police officers suffered minor injuries when alcohol-fueled pre-St. Patrick's Day celebrations got out of control. The Blarney Blowout is one of the biggest events of the year for University of Massachusetts students, who flock in their thousands to bars and parties across the city. Ahead of the events, the university reached out to students, landlords, parents, faculty and staff to 'communicate the importance of students acting safely and respecting the property of others'. But warnings from the university to curb behavior went unheeded by many students, who were looking forward to a day of partying. Out of control: Hundreds of students filled the streets for the annual event enjoyed by UMass students . Videos and photographs from the event showed the crowd, made up mostly of students, started to set off fireworks, causing police to fire paintball-style guns loaded with pepper spray. On the day, Amherst police captain Jennifer Gundersen called the rioting 'extremely disturbing and unsafe' and called it 'perhaps one of the worst scenes we have ever had with drunkenness and unruliness'. Most of those arrested were charged with failing to disperse. Davis' 65-page report concluded that town police were 'overwhelmed and unprepared'. 'This report contains some hard observations, and I commend the university for taking a detailed look at this problem and to everyone involved for sharing their candid observations,' Davis said on Friday. 'There was general agreement among all stakeholders that the 2014 Blarney Blowout was a collective failure by the town, the university and the students. Questions: Dozens of people were arrested and four police officers were hurt in the choas on March . 'They expressed a desire to move forward together with a collective responsibility to provide improved safety and a better quality of life for everyone in Amherst.' UMass Chancellor Kumble Subbaswamy and Amherst Town Manager John Musante said they are taking seriously the report's recommendations for avoiding similar problems in the future. In an announcement on Friday, UMass President Robert Caret said the report is an important step in changing the culture of the university. 'The recommendations that former Commissioner Davis makes are serious ones, and I hope that all parties will take steps to implement them,' said Caret. 'I know that we at the university will do our part, and I further know that we look forward to working closely with the Town of Amherst and other parties to bring about the changes that are needed and create the new climate that we seek.'","Blarney Blowout - one of the biggest events of the year for University of Massachusetts students - got wildly out of hand in March .

"A man was shot in the chest on early Friday morning after he tried to break into the Las Vegas home of a former girlfriend, according to police. The incident happened about 1 a.m. and police say the unidentified woman called 911 complaining that an ex-boyfriend was kicking down her door. Police have named the male accused of breaking into the apartment as 22-year-old Douglas Eugene Jackson. An unidentified woman has said that she forced to shot an ex-boyfriend twice after he forced entry into her apartment at 1 a.m. on Friday. This photo was posted online and shows her battered front door . The woman, who has asked not to be named, later posted a blog post in which she appeared to confess to shooting her ‘stalker’. She told FOX5 that although she was in a relationship with Jackson for a month, she ‘wouldn’t qualify [it] as romantic.’ According to police, Jackson forced his way into the apartment and the woman fired two shots, one hitting him directly in the chest, police said. Jackson then ran away, but was found hiding in bushes by a K-9 unit and arrested. The victim has shared a series of screenshots she said detailed numerous texts and online messages from Jackson . In her blog post, titled 'I shot my stalker tonight', the victim explained that she was forced to move, get a restraining order, and obtain a concealed carry permit after Jackson started ‘stalking’ her. The post also included a photo believed to show her front door after it had been forced open. The victim sent FOX5 a series of screenshots she said detailed numerous texts and online messages from Jackson. She also said she had been sleeping with a chair in front of her door to keep her stalker out. I'm writing this staring at the mess the police left for me, in a bit of a fog. After 6 months of stalking and threats against my life my stalker finally snapped and decided to kick my door in and make good on his promise. Out of fear, the past month I had begun sleeping with a chair propped against my front door, to give myself a few extra precious seconds in case of emergency. I shudder to think how differently things might've turned out had I not barricaded the door. I awoke around 1:15 am to the sound of the door giving way after one kick followed by the sounds of my stalker struggling to dislodge the chair while forcing his way inside. I jumped up and grabbed the gun I've learned to do everything even shower with. I stood at the top of my stairs and fired twice. Hitting him in the chest, I hear his scream, his disbelief that I'd stood up for myself.. 0 to 100 in milliseconds. I've never been so afraid in my life. I do not know if he is living, but I do know the police have him and that's what helps the most. For months of him evading the police I began to question whether he was unstoppable. Untraceable. Houdini, he would murder me and get away with it. As of now I'm in a haze of guilt, surprise, relief and disbelief. I shook as the canines drag him out from his hiding place under a bush. I survived, where so many people do not. Holy s***, I survived. Edit: The outpouring of support is WILD. I cant thank you guys enough. Everyone can be a critic and the fact still remains, you don't know what you will do in a situation until its presented in front of you. Those who believe there was other things to be done have never had someone tell you that you no longer deserve to draw breath and mean it. And for the 'should've fired a warning shot' folks: There are no warning shots, a gun is a deadly force, you only pull that trigger if you are in fear for your life and all other methods of deterring are gone. When he kicked my door in, there was no longer a deterrent preventing harm. Warning shots are dangerous and could hurt the unintended. This is not a wild west movie. That's what responsible gun ownership is. I'll update once things have calmed down a bit I promise. I'll write back to everyone and after being isolated for so long, anyone who wants to be friends, I am always accepting those.","A man identified as Douglas Eugene Jackson, 22, was shot in the chest in the early hours of Friday morning .

"A primary school ‘superhead’ being paid £170,000 a year refitted her office with £26,000 worth of furniture. A probe by finance watchdogs found the Silver Birch Academy Trust, led by Patricia Davies, spent £4,500 on a desk and £1,700 on a fridge. The trust runs two primary schools in east London which between them cater for about 750 pupils. Patricia Davies was named head teacher of the year at the 2011 Teaching Awards for transforming the fortunes of Chingford Hall Primary (above) Following a tip-off from two whistleblowers, officials from the Education Funding Agency investigated the trust and queried the spending of tens of thousands of pounds. An office for Mrs Davies at one school was kitted out with a £4,487 desk, a £4,887 conference table, a £4,967 wall unit, a £1,687 fridge unit and 14 wood-framed executive leather armchairs costing £4,998. The total bill, including other chairs, a glass coffee table and pot plants, was £25,996. Patricia Davies was named head teacher of the year at the 2011 Teaching Awards for transforming the fortunes of Chingford Hall Primary . ‘We have not seen a business case to support the assertion that these represented value for money,’ EFA investigators concluded in their report. A further £20,500 was spent on other offices in the school, Whittingham Primary Academy, giving a total spend on furniture of £46,490. The report pointed out that the school’s policy is to obtain quotes for spending above £5,000. On a single date in May last year, seven invoices totalling more than £20,000 – but each under the £5,000 threshold – had been made out. ‘The executive head teacher stated that there was no intention to split payments and this was not an attempt to avoid the need for written quotations,’ the report said. Mrs Davies – named head teacher of the year at the 2011 Teaching Awards for transforming the fortunes of Chingford Hall Primary, which she also runs – told the EFA the furniture would help the academy generate rental income. The report said: ‘The executive head teacher explained that she was looking for a particular product that she had seen at another academy and that the table, chairs and built-in fridge unit will provide a quality facility, a change to the profile of the school, that can be rented out for external meetings.’ A further £20,500 was spent on other offices in  Whittingham Primary Academy (above), giving a total spend on furniture of £46,490 by the Silver Birch Academy Trust . Details of the report were highlighted yesterday by campaign group Local Schools Network. It said that a Freedom of Information request a month ago asking how often the head’s office had been rented out for meetings had so far received no reply. The EFA report – published earlier this year with a series of recommendations for the trust on improving its practice – also questioned the process for commissioning £200,000 worth of refurbishments to the main Whittingham Primary building. The school was judged ‘good’ by Ofsted at its last inspection, the second highest rating. Latest accounts for the Silver Birch Academy Trust show Mrs Davies was paid £170,000 to £175,000 in 2012/13 – around three times the typical salary for a primary head. Andy Silvester, campaign manager for the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘There’s simply no excuse for this wasteful spending. ‘Taxpayers will be furious that their money has been spent on top-of-the-range desks and fridges, and the head teacher’s huge salary rubs salt in the wound. You have to wonder why it was deemed appropriate to spend money on furniture rather than children’s education.’ It emerged yesterday that another academy chain, Inspiration Trust, spent £420 on a Vera Wang tea set, £2,775 on a table, £3,400 on two Boss armchairs and £2,600 on a Boss sofa. The Norwich-based trust insisted the expenditure was reasonable. The school website for Chingford Hall Primary is available in 81 languages including Esperanto, Haitian Creole, Hmong, Maori, Welsh, Yiddish and Zulu.","Probe found Silver Birch Academy Trust, led by Patricia Davies, also spent £5,000 on a conference table and 14 armchairs costing another £5,000 .

"Officials say runway lights at Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina were turned off early - disrupting two incoming flights and canceling two departures. Airport operations director Gary Broughton told local reporters a runway repaving job is occasionally prompting officials to close both runways late at night when the work is done. Broughton said Wednesday night the lights were improperly turned off at 11:15 p.m., instead of at 12:15 a.m. Thursday.

Mysterious: Officials say runway lights at Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina (pictured) were turned off one hour early . Since the planes weren't in Wilmington, two early morning flights Thursday were canceled. Broughton says the airport is working to make sure it doesn't happen again. An FAA spokesperson told MailOnline in an email exchange the agency is looking into how the incident occurred. 'The FAA planned to deactivate both [Instrument Landing Systems] at 12:15 am for runway construction, they were disabled at 11:15 pm,' the spokesperson said. 'Two air carrier flights that were scheduled to land during that hour returned to their departure airports.' Military consultant Steve Ganyard told ABC News 'Somebody went in and shutdown everything that had to do with landing at this airport. 'They shut down the lights, they shut down the instrument landing system. There was nobody to talk to.' 'There was no way that they could have successfully or safely shot an approach into Wilmington with both the runway lights and the instrument landing system turned off,' Ganyard also told the website.

"The Home Secretary's former grace-and-favour home has sold for an eye-watering £14million - more than three times what the Labour government got for it just four years ago. The six-bedroom house in upmarket Belgravia, central London, was put on the market for £4million as the credit crunch hit in September 2008. It fell into disuse and was invaded by squatters as the Home Office took 18 months to find a buyer - and accounts suggest it could have sold for as little as £3million in April 2010. Eye-watering: The Home Secretary's former grace-and-favour home in Belgravia, central London, has sold for £14million - more than three times what the government got for it in the recession just four years ago . Home: The central London property was once occupied by David Blunkett (right at his front door in 2005) Less than four years later, it has been sold on to a property firm for an enormous mark-up. London Leasehold Properties paid £14million for the house in February - helped by the previous owners winning permission to turn it into a sprawling luxury home with an 'iceberg' basement. David Blunkett was the last Home Secretary to live in the shabby postwar house before the government ruled it was no longer needed. He hit out at the apparent wasted opportunity, telling The Sun: 'It would have been nice if they [the government] had got a more substantial investment back'. The house made headlines in 2009 when it was invaded by serial squatter Mark Guard, who put a 'legal warning' on the window and invited reporters into his new home for an interview. Outdated: A Home Office spokesman insisted the home, pictured in 2009, was in need of refurbishment . 'It's a disgrace,' he told the Daily Mail at the time. 'Why the hell do they leave a place like this empty? It has lost about £2million in value since Blunkett went and there are more like this in the ownership of Gordon Brown's government. 'In Belgravia alone there are 312 properties left empty by offshore companies and more that are just being left to rot.' But the Home Office was also a victim of a crippling recession followed by spiralling London house prices. Average prices near Mr Bunkett's former home in South Eaton Place have risen £2million - 50 per cent - since the depths of the recession in 2009. A Home Office spokesman refused to confirm  how much the house sold for in 2010. The department's accounts, however, list what is thought to be the former grace and favour home, and put the final sale value of the building and land at just £3.029million. Lying empty: The house pictured as it spent 18 months languishing on the market during the recession . Just three years later, the house's new owners exploded its value by winning planning permission to knock it down and turn it into two eight-storey homes - including three levels in the basement. The 'iceberg' homes approved last year would include a cinema room, snooker room, wine store, offices and a garage with a car lift. It is not thought building work had started when it was sold on for £14million in February. A Home Office spokesman told MailOnline: 'The property was put up for sale under the last government as it was no longer required by the Home Office. 'It was publicly advertised and marketed by Savills before being sold in April 2010. 'It was in need of refurbishment and achieved the best possible price in the market at the time.'","Grace and favour home in Belgravia, London, used by David Blunkett .

"Wanted: Scotland Yard have put out this Efit of a burglar who held a knife to the throat of a baby before taking cash and jewellery . Police are hunting burglars who held a knife to a 15-month-old baby before stealing cash and jewellery in a raid on Halloween, Scotland Yard said today. A wanted man posed as a meter reader from the water board at a house in Uxbridge, west London, before threatening to stab the owner's daughter. While holding his knife to the little girl he yelled: 'Where is the gold?' before tying up the 31-year-old woman and locking her in a toilet with her terrified child. Detectives say the burglar was joined by a female accomplice before searching the property and stealing cash and jewellery at around 5pm on October 31, . The suspect was wearing an energy company ID  around his neck and a high-visibility jacket, which made the victim believe he was a genuine meter reader. The victim showed him where the meters were kept in a cupboard before he attacked them. The mother of the baby came out of the family home and said: 'I have been told by the police not to say anything. We don't want to say any more.' They were found by a neighbour about 50 minutes later and police were called. The woman who recued them said today: 'Her husband called me from work because he couldn't get in touch with her so my daughter and I went round to see if she was okay. 'We let ourselves in and found her tied up in the bathroom. She was in quite a state and the baby was with her. I don't want to say too much - it was awful.' Neighbours say police have since warned them that the burglars are 'targeting Asian families' and are specifically looking for valuable Asian gold. Heba Kotob, 34, said: 'It is the fourth burglary around here since last December. I don't feel safe in this area anymore'. Stanley Cross, 54, said police had visited neighbours since the burglary to warn them about a man knocking on doors wearing a high-vis jacket. The father-of-seven said: 'They came around on Saturday and said to keep an eye out for anyone like that and not to open the door to anyone in uniform. 'The officer said they're targeting people with Asian gold. He said they're targeting Asian families. 'I couldn't believe it when I heard.' Terrifying: The burglar said he wanted to read a meter before bursting in with a knife demanding: 'Where's the gold?' Detective Constable Anji Dawson, from Hillingdon police, said: 'Thankfully these types of incidents are very rare and the victim did not suffer any serious injuries. However this was a terrifying burglary which has left the mother of a very young child extremely shaken. 'This incident happened on Halloween at about 5pm, so we believe there may have been many people in the area that may have seen the suspect. 'I would urge anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area or has information on what happened to come forward as soon as possible. 'We know our male suspect was joined by a female once he had put the mother and daughter in the bathroom. The victim did not see his female accomplice, but she did hear her. This woman must have been waiting close by and may well have been seen by someone in the street.' Police said the woman only realised she was being burgled when she heard her 15-month-old daughter scream. She turned around and saw the suspect holding a knife to her daughter. The suspect bound the mother's wrists and ankles and put her and her daughter in the bathroom, The Met said. Police urgently want to find the man and woman involved in this crime. The male suspect is white, aged in his early 30s and approximately 5ft 10ins tall. He had a goatee beard and a neck tattoo and spoke with a local London accent. He was wearing a blue-coloured fleece with a short sleeved high-visibility jacket, dark trousers, black shoes and a woolly hat. There is no description of the female accomplice, who was heard, but not seen by the victim. A spokesman added: 'We remind the public to make sure tradesmen who call at the door are genuine, before they enter your home. Ask to check their identification; if in doubt make them wait at the door and contact the company they work for or the police. 'Police have conducted numerous house-to-house enquires and increased reassurance patrols in the area'. If you have any information please call DC Anji Dawson at Hillingdon Police Station on 020 8246 1529. If you wish to remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Scotland Yard release Efit of burglar who threatened to stab a 15-month-old .

Sandberg and husband David Goldberg, CEO of Survey Monkey, came out the winners nonetheless, making a $1million profit on the home their purchased in 2004 for nearly $8million. Moving out: Sheryl Sandberg has sold her Atherton, California mansion for $9.25million - more than a $1million what she purchased the home for in 2004 . Off the market: The Facebook COO and her husband David Goldberg sold their home in America's richest zip code last month, a year after putting it on the market for $10.5million . Money smart: Sandberg became a public figure last year after the release of her book 'Lean In' a manifesto for professional women looking for success in the workplace (right).

According to Trulia, the 7-bedroom, 8.5-bath mansion 'is stylishly appointed, with exceptional finishes throughout'. The new owners are inheriting a home that has been visited by President Obama and Lady Gaga, who attended a $38,500-plate fundraiser there in 2011. Condoleezza Rice, Gloria Steinem and Michael Bloomberg have also been invited in the past to speak at the Sandberg home. The 'Lean In' author, her husband and their two young children have been living in a newly-completed home in nearby Menlo Park for the past year. They purchased a Mediterranean-style bungalow there in 2009, tore it town, and replaced it with a $11million 9,200-square-foot modern home with six bedrooms and six bathrooms. Two years later, Facebook's headquarters relocated closer to that home, making it a more convenient choice for the Sanberg-Goldberg clan.

"When he said he'd be back, this may not have been quite what he meant. Thirty years after Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in Conan the Barbarian, the aging action hero is returning to southern Spain to play a quite different role. The Austrian-born American actor, 67, has been nominated as Madrid's first honorary ambassador of tourism. A new role for Arnie: Mr Schwarzenegger, pictured recently at  Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany . Spanish officials asked the Terminator actor to join a new campaign to increase foreign tourism to the capital, after the economic downturn affected many of its attractions and institutions such as the Museo del Prado. As part of his new role, Arnie has already scheduled to instate a star named for him on the Paseo de las Estrellas (Walk of Stars) in Almería. Gran Via in Madrid. City officials have enlisted Mr Schwarzenegger, after the downturn affected tourism . The a former governor of California catapulted to fame after his turn in the 1982 Conan film, which was filmed on location around southern Spain. The blockbuster, which earned a massive £185 million at the Box Office, also gave the local economy a boost. It has been reported that he will be looking for locations to shoot a new Conan film, as he was spotted with movie producer Fredrik Malmberg, who worked on  the 2011 remake of the film. The 1982 Conan film raised Schwarzenegger to stardom and it's hoped he can now boost Madrid's profile .

"A woman is set to scale one of the world's highest mountains for a second time after she forgot her first climb because of altitude-related amnesia. Doreen Cree first reached the top of Mount Kilimanjaro in 2012 but suffered altitude sickness during the entire expedition. The 53-year-old reached the summit of Africa's highest peak but had to be escorted down by a doctor and the illness caused her memory to black out. Doreen Cree first reached the top of Mount Kilimanjaro in 2012 but suffered altitude sickness during the entire expedition. She is pictured on her first ascent . Doreen Cree (pictured) reached the summit of Africa's highest peak but had to be escorted down by a doctor and the illness caused her memory to black out . It left the office worker with a five-hour gap in her memory including the moment - she was later told by fellow climbers - she watched the sunrise from the almost 20,000ft-high peak. She has a series of photographs of her taken at the top but cannot remember ever being on the climb - where she raised money for Alzheimer's Disease. But she is now determined to get the memories back - by climbing the mountain a second time. Ms Cree - known as Dee - of Hillingdon, west London, said: 'I was suffering quite badly with altitude sickness during the climb. 'My face swelled up and I looked almost unrecognisable. The last thing I can remember is five or six hours after the summit when we were climbing down. The condition left Doreen Cree (right) with a five-hour gap in her memory including the moment she watched the sunrise from the almost 20,000ft-high peak . 'The doctor said I'd get my memories of that particular six hours back, but they never came. And now I've got to do it all over again.' During the first climb Ms Cree and her group of sixteen others camped only a couple of hours away from the peak and raised around £65,000 for The Alzheimer's Society. She cannot remember the last remaining stretch of the climb but can just about recall being at Stella Point - 200m from the top. Ms Cree has now jumped at the chance to be part of a 35-strong team attempting to climb the mountain in January, once again for The Alzheimer's Society. She said: 'I suppose it's a bit ironic that I'm climbing to raise money for Alzheimer's but I cannot remember doing it. Ms Cree (pictured) has now jumped at the chance to be part of a 35-strong team attempting to climb the mountain in January, once again for The Alzheimer's Society . 'I love doing things for charity, and I wanted to raise money after the sudden death of my mum at Christmas in 2010. 'I never got to say goodbye, so I wanted to go somewhere high enough to say goodbye to her properly. 'I must have done that when I got to the top, but since I can't remember, I want to do it all over again.' Best friend Sue Cree, 62, hopes her friend will be able to remember the experience this time around. She said: 'Dee is the strongest person I know, we're like sisters. On the first day her knee went, but she strapped it up and carried on. That's the type of woman she is. Ms Cree (right) cannot remember the last remaining stretch of the climb but can just about recall being at Stella Point - 200m from the top . 'And to do all that and go all that way to not remember the final bit, the thing that kept her going up the mountain, is just too cruel. 'That's why she's doing it again. I've got nothing but admiration for her.' Memory loss is a common symptom of acute mountain sickness, caused by the body struggling to cope with a lack of oxygen at high altitude. The potentially fatal syndrome can occur at altitudes above 5000ft. Climbers usually spend time adjusting to the high altitude at a specialist camp to prevent the condition.","Doreen Cree first reached the peak in 2011 but suffered altitude sickness .

"Nigeria are implicated in another match-fixing scandal after an agent was filmed claiming he could rig matches in Brazil. Football . agent Henry Chukwuma Okoroji was caught on camera insisting he could . organise games and certain outcomes during the World Cup. The allegations, which emerged in a national newspaper on Sunday, saw Okoroji suggest he could arrange a yellow card for 250,000 (£40,660) and a penalty for 2100,000 (£81,370). Plot: A Nigerian football agent has claimed that he could arrange a yellow card for £40,000 and a red card for £80,000 during this summer's World Cup . This comes just days after the . National Crime Agency (NCA) investigated allegations that last week’s . friendly between Nigeria and Scotland had been targeted. Speaking to a . reporter from a hotel room in Milan, Okoroji and an associate — referred . to as Joe — outlined their prices. To . enhance their credibility, the pair also invited Lazio and Nigeria . footballer Ogenyi Onazi to the meeting, however, there is no suggestion . he was involved in the match-fixing plot. Okoroji . said he had already recruited two Nigerian players for this summer and . was planning to fly to Brazil to oversee his scams. The . agent said: ‘Hundred per cent, two players. It’s left up to you people . what you want to do. You will pay for a yellow or a red card or a . penalty.’ After making the offer, Okoroji rang a top Nigerian player and claimed he had agreed to take part in the fix.

"A man who is accused of running over and killing his neighbour with his car apparently wrote a detailed 'action plan' of revenge on his computer. Melbourne retired civil engineer Joseph Drago, 69, is charged with murdering Anthony Richard Dockerty over a dispute regarding Mr Dockerty's rowdy dog. Police found an `action plan' on Drago's computer setting out attacks ranging from flooding Mr Dockerty's house to putting an inflatable kangaroo on the road at night in the hope he would crash, the court has heard. Melbourne retired civil engineer Joseph Drago, 69, is charged with murdering Anthony Richard Dockerty over a dispute regarding Mr Dockerty's rowdy dog . 'He has contemplated crime after crime after crime before the man died,' Mr Tinney told the court on Friday. Victorian Supreme Court prosecutor, Andrew Tinney SC, said Balwyn North local Drago had complained to police after Mr Dockerty failed to appear at court last year when both were charged with offences relating to their dispute. Mr Tinney said Drago told police in November: 'If you're not going to do your job I will and you're not going to like what I do.' CCTV footage played to a previous court hearing showed Drago accelerating over Mr Dockerty, dragging him under his car some 116 metres down the road . On December 2 Drago drove to the Thornbury factory where Mr Dockerty worked to take photos of him. The pair had an altercation before Drago climbed into his car, while Mr Dockerty stood in front of the vehicle to block his escape. CCTV footage played to a previous court hearing showed Drago accelerating over Mr Dockerty, dragging him under his car some 116 metres down the road. Drago's barrister Constantine Helliotis QC said the anti-social acts that took place between Drago and Mr Dockerty were not on the plan of action. 'There is no connection between what's on the computer and what happened in real life,' Mr Helliotis said. Police found an `action plan' on Drago's computer setting out attacks ranging from flooding Mr Dockerty's house to putting an inflatable kangaroo on the road at night in the hope he would crash . Drago reportedly told police in November: 'If you're not going to do your job I will and you're not going to like what I do.' Psychologist Patrick Newton said the plan was contemplated action rather than implemented action and Drago had lost perspective. 'People in heated disputes, protracted disputes, often consider things that are out of proportion,' Mr Newton said. Judge Paul Coghlan said the extraordinary material found on the computer had not been properly addressed by Mr Newton's reports. He adjourned the bail application to allow further psychological testing on Drago.","A Melbourne man has appeared in court charged with running over and killing his neighbour with his car .

"A Banksy mural of a woman staring at an empty plinth has been vandalised with a spray-painted image of a penis. The piece, which appeared in Payers Park in Folkestone, Kent, just two weeks ago, is the latest of the artist's works to have been defaced. Titled Art Buff, it depicts an elderly woman wearing headphones while staring at an empty plinth with her hands behind her back, and is worth an estimated £300,000. Scroll down for video . Art Buff in Folkestone, Kent,  was defaced by vandals who drew a penis onto the perspex glass protecting the painting . The artwork appeared in the seaside town just two weeks ago and praised by excited local people . Vandals have painted a penis over the protective perspex glass which keeps the original painting from being destroyed. The offensive image has been removed from the artwork, though Kent Police are investigating the incident. A Shepway District Council spokesman said they were working with officers to determine what happened. 'Despite the unconventional way in which it appeared, Art Buff by Banksy is considered by many to be a valuable cultural addition to Folkestone. 'It has been attracting visitors to the town ever since it was discovered at the end of September. Shepway District Council officers are working with the police who are investigating the incident.' Upon its completion, Dreamlands Arcade, who own the building on which it appeared, employed security guards to watch over the valuable artwork, but they are not thought to have been working when it was vandalised. Art Buff is the latest of Banky's works to have been defaced. Following a residency in New York last year a handful of his pieces were tarnished by other graffiti artists, while others applied paint strip to murals in the UK. One of his most popular pieces, Spy Booth, has been totally destroyed after pub-goers used strip to ruin the faces of the three men in trench-coats depicted outside the phone box in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Before: The mural appeared in the seaside town two weeks ago and was welcomed by local authorities .

Banksy, who is famously anonymous, has not spoken out against vandals who paint over his work. Residents in Folkestone spoke out their disappointment on social media today, with one writing: 'Dont take long in folkestone for the wrongens to come out and ruin something (sic)'.

"A judge struck down part of Missouri's gay marriage ban for the first time on Friday by ordering the state to recognize same-sex marriages legally performed in other states, saying state laws banning the unions single out gay couples 'for no logical reason.' The order means such couples will be eligible to sign up for a wide range of tax, health insurance, veterans and other benefits now afforded to opposite-sex married couples. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, who has defended the state's ban on gay marriage, said his office was reviewing the ruling. Victory: Same-sex couple Zuleyma Tang-Martinez, second from right, and Arlene Zarembka, right, of St. Louis, give interviews at the Jackson County Courthouse in Kansas City, Missouri . The decision comes in a lawsuit filed by 10 same-sex couples who legally married outside the state, including Arlene Zarembka and Zuleyma Tang-Martinez. The St. Louis couple, who married in Canada, said Friday's ruling could boost their household income, and they plan to apply Monday for Zarembka to receive Social Security benefits as Tang-Martinez's spouse. 'To me, it's a real validation by the judge of our relationship and our commitment to each other,' Tang-Martinez said. The American Civil Liberties Union, which is helping the couples, noted the ruling was a first in the state. 'We're gratified that the court recognized that married same-sex couples and their families are no different than other couples, and that the Constitution requires them to be treated equally,' ACLU attorney Tony Rothert said. 'This is not the first court to reach this conclusion, but it is the first court to do so in Missouri, so it's a tremendous day for our state.' Jackson County Circuit Judge J. Dale Youngs sided with the couples, who argue that their rights to equal protection and due process are being violated by Missouri's ban on gay marriage. Youngs said the couples deserve the same recognition as opposite-sex couples who married in other states. 'The undisputed facts before the Court show that, to the extent these laws prohibit plaintiffs' legally contracted marriages from other states being recognized here, they are wholly irrational, do not rest upon any reasonable basis, and are purely arbitrary,' Youngs wrote. 'All they do is treat one segment of the population - gay men and lesbians - differently than their same-sex counterparts, for no logical reason.' Landmark: The ruling entitles same-sex couples who married elsewhere to apply for various state benefits and entitlements - though it did not address the state's current ban on same-sex marriage ceremonies . The lawsuit before Youngs only challenges Missouri's refusal to recognize marriages legally performed outside the state, not laws that bar same-sex couples from getting married in Missouri. Rothert said the ruling means that thousands of Missouri couples can now qualify for spousal government benefits and, on a smaller level, change their last names to match their spouse's on their Missouri driver's license. The case is among at least three challenging Missouri's ban: There is a federal challenge in Kansas City, and a St. Louis case focuses on city officials who issued marriage licenses to four same-sex couples to trigger a legal test of the ban. The lawsuits are based on the same arguments that led the U.S. Supreme Court last year to overturn part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that denied a tax, health and other benefits to legally married gay couples. In Missouri, Youngs said he expects the state Supreme Court to 'provide the last word on all of the important legal issues presented by this case.' Same-sex marriage is now legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia. The ACLU has cases pending against 13 other states with such bans, including five cases currently before federal appeals courts.

"The first manuscript page from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s second Sherlock Holmes story is returning to London after an absence of more than a century. The handwritten manuscript from The Sign of Four in 1889 is said to be one of the rarest items known to enthusiasts of the fictional detective. Sir Arthur's leaf of paper is the earliest manuscript page of the famous author’s Holmes collection to be sent to publishers and printed verbatim. Unique item: The handwritten manuscript from The Sign of Four in 1889 is said to be one of the rarest items known to enthusiasts of the fictional detective . Book: The leaf of paper is the earliest manuscript page of the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s (left) Holmes collection to be sent to publishers and printed verbatim . And the page includes references to the unconventional habits of the Baker Street literary legend - namely his taking of cocaine. It is going on display at the Museum of London having been loaned by the University of California in San Diego, where it has resided since 1977. Previously the manuscript changed hands at auction in New York in 1914 for $6 (£4) and again in 1929 for $50 (£31). The first two paragraphs of the page - titled ‘Chapter I: The science of deduction’ - tell of Holmes injecting himself with ‘a 7 per cent solution’ of cocaine. Holmes’s forearm and wrist are said to be ‘all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks’. Location: The display coincides with the 125th anniversary of Sir Arthur completing the book, after it was commissioned at The Langham Hotel (above, in 1890) in 1889 . Plaque: On August 30, 1889, JM Stoddart of US literary publication Lippincott’s Magazine had dinner at The Langham with Wilde and Sir Arthur . He finds the drug so ‘transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment’. The display coincides with the 125th anniversary of Sir Arthur completing the book, after it was commissioned at The Langham Hotel in London in 1889. Sir Arthur took just one month to deliver his finished manuscript - and at the same meeting, Oscar Wilde was asked to write The Picture of Dorian Gray. The museum says the page will form part of the largest temporary exhibition to be staged on Holmes in London since the Festival of Britain in 1951. Famous names: At the Langham meeting, JM Stoddart commissioned the authors to write The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Sign of Four . Famous dinner: Sir Arthur took just one month to deliver his finished manuscript - and at the same meeting, Oscar Wilde was asked to write The Picture of Dorian Gray . Alex Werner, lead curator of the museum’s exhibition, said: ‘Sherlock Holmes is a global icon indelibly linked to London. ‘As a mark of tribute to the 125th anniversary of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle completing his second Sherlock Holmes story, we have brought the first manuscript page of The Sign of Four back to the city which hosted its birth.’ On August 30, 1889, JM Stoddart of US literary publication Lippincott’s Magazine had dinner at The Langham with Wilde and Sir Arthur. He commissioned them to write The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Sign of Four respectively, with Sir Arthur finishing his work on September 30. Historic: The museum says it is holding the largest temporary exhibition to be staged on Holmes in London since the Festival of Britain in 1951 . Nicholas Utechin, historian for the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, said: ‘The Langham dinner revived a career that was all but comatose. ‘Arthur Conan Doyle had published the first Sherlock Holmes story - A Study in Scarlet - two years earlier.' Mr Utechin, who is also former editor of The Sherlock Holmes Journal, added: 'The tale was mentioned only in one or two small reviews. ‘It was this 1889 commission that resuscitated Sherlock Holmes, and without it, readers may never have met the character ever again.’ Tickets for the exhibition - which runs from October 17 until April 12, 2015 - are £12 for adults and £10 concessions.

"X Factor star Chloe Jasmine Whichello may have  had  a secret boyfriend since the start of the show, despite claims judges gave her preferential treatment because she was heartbroken and single. The controversial singer was allowed to perform for judges twice after fluffing her first audition because of a break-up of a relationship. But it has now emerged that she has been dating Craig Wiffen, a businessman and former soldier for several months, a source said today. Mr Wiffen's twitter account says that Miss Whichello is his girlfriend and he has posted a number of romantic messages and photographs of the singer. Scroll down for video . Selfie: Craig Wiffen, a  former soldier is pictured with X Factor girlfriend Chloe Jasmine Whichello, who apparently had help at her first X Factor audition because she was heartbroken about a break-up . Emotional: Chloe sobbed as she was put through to the live shows by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. Previously she cried in front of 5,000 people when she forgot words to a song and was allowed back the following day . Tribute: Mr Wiffen wrote this message on Sunday during the show and his girlfriend responded . On Sunday, as Chloe was about to be shown performing at judge Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's house in Nice, he wrote: 'Good luck tonight to my very beautiful and very talented girlfriend @CHLOEJASMINEW. I am and always will be very proud of you x'. Controversial: Having already been embroiled in a fix row, Chloe's X Factor journey has not been smooth . An X Factor source confirmed they are a couple, but would not confirm how long they had been together. Chloe-Jasmine Whichello's path to the live shows has been controversial, with some viewers claiming her success has been part of a wider fix. During her first audition at Wembley Arena broadcast in September she tried to sing jazz song Misty, but when stood in front of 5,000 people she forgot the lyrics and burst into tears. But viewers only saw her second audition in front of a different crowd on the following day, which left the judges impressed and was put through to the next stage after performing another song. A ITV source told The Sun: 'Chloe's original arena audition was so bad it was never shown. It was a car crash. 'Chloe was given a second chance as she was upset during her first performance. 'She had recently split up with her boyfriend so she wasn't in a fit state to perform. We gave her the chance to go away and compose herself'. Chloe, who was selected as one of Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's three live show acts over the weekend, has had elocution lessons since the age of 11 as part of her drama school background. An ex-boyfriend of the model-turned-singer recently claimed she is a wild child who often went on booze and drug benders.  Dave Kai Piper told The Sun that it was 'like dating Courtney Love'. It was also claimed she was allegedly a fan of attending posh orgies and she was a regular guest at the events organised by Killing Kittens, though the company tweeted on Saturday 'it's news to us.' It also emerged that she had previously auditioned for The X Factor in 2006, when then-judge Sharon Osbourne branded her 'every parent's nightmare'. Mr Wiffen posted this picture of the singer apparently watching television in bed a fortnight ago . And he posted this picture of Chloe in a well-cut dress last month, adding the hashtag #teamCJ .

"There are some things in life, such as putting your finger into a live electrical socket, that you would never try again. Playing James Milner at right back in an England shirt is another. To think that a two-time winner of the Barclays Premier League is not considered good enough to play in his own position for the national team is a remarkable call. Getting a chasing: Milner (right) labours as Jefferson Montero shows him a clean pair of heels . Headscratcher: James Milner (right), who struggled at right back, looks bemused after Ecuador's opener . Playing Milner at right back, just in case Glen Johnson is injured during the World Cup, is not a viable alternative. It was a mistake. This was a training ground experiment that Roy Hodgson was determined to put to the test during one of England’s tune-up matches. Every time an Ecuador player was in possession at the Sun Life Stadium, they looked up and hoped to send the ball left, to the feet of Jefferson Montero. It was a deliberate strategy, designed to unsettle Milner after Hodgson's decision to deploy him in England’s second choice defence. Just as Milner was adjusting to an unorthodox position, Ecuador went in front with a move that only really got going when his poor clearance fell to Montero in the eighth minute. England’s defence was exposed, brutally as it turned out when Enner Valencia rose above Chris Smalling to power his header beyond Ben Foster. Rest: Milner (left) has a much-needed breather during his first-half chasing . You could see where Hodgson was going with this and it seemed like a solid idea when he talked it through. Uncomfortable: England are unlikely to repeat the Milner experiment . That’s what these games are for and the fact that it didn't really work out is no biggie. It would be lazy to blame Milner for this performance, particularly when he was thrust, unexpectedly, into an unorthodox role. When the pressure was on in the final stages of the Premier League season, the City midfielder excelled in their engine room. It takes time to learn a new position and it was fairly obvious, the quick feet of Montero out on Ecuador’s left, that England will need to look elsewhere. He wasn’t helped by the first half indiscipline of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was supposed to be offering some kind of protection to Milner down England’s right. Going forward they were dependable, a real threat whenever they combed through Ecuador’s midfield. Still, it didn’t feel right. Hodgson’s alternative at right back is Smalling, for whom he has a soft spot despite the defender's failure to get off the floor to challenge Valencia. When you think of England’s first-choice central defensive partnership - Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka - there is a feeling of safety and security. Neither of them are world beaters but they have huge experience in the Premier League. Smalling and Phil Jones just don’t offer that. For some players it takes 10 or more caps before they feel comfortable playing for the national team. With these two you wonder whether it will ever happen at all. Soft centre: Phil Jones (left) and Chris Smalling were unconvincing at the heart of England's defence . Jones, to be fair to him, was returning to the England team after recovering from a shoulder injury that has ruled him out of action since May 6. At least Luke Shaw, making his first start for England, offered some entertainment going forward. Defensively he was sound, too. He is unfazed by the England experience and Hodgson will have no hesitation putting him into the team should Leighton Baines blow up. Beyond that, this defensive experiment burned out pretty swiftly.","Milner is not a viable alternative to first-choice right back Glen Johnson .

"For a man who had never used a computer until last year, Dan McIntosh has blazed an extraordinary path to becoming a Facebook sensation- all for his stunning photography showing off life in rural Australia. The outback cook has now launched a book titled 'Outback Stations' detailing what 'real' life is like in Australia, featuring photographs from the people who work and live in some of the toughest conditions in the country. Dan, known affectionately as 'Cookie', has been feeding hungry workers in woolsheds and mustering camps for the past 30 years, and has spent much of his life as a wanderer in the Northern Territory. The rural cook has now launched a book titled 'Outback Stations' detailing what 'real' life is like in Australia . Dan, known affectionately as 'Cookie', has been feeding hungry workers in woolsheds and mustering camps for the past 30 years . His colourful and earthy life was something he was keen to share with his family and friends, and so the well-loved foodie started a Facebook page to post photographs of his life to. 'Never in a million years would you think that it would become a book. Just incredible. It's hard to believe,' said Dan. 'I’ve been a cook for nearly 36 years,' said Dan. 'It all started when I was 15. I was working in Queensland at a property called Kiagara. The old cook went out for a big night, got locked up in the jailhouse and never came back,' 'So the job was in. I was only 15.' His colourful and earthy life was something he was keen to share with his family and friends, and so the well-loved foodie started a Facebook page to post photographs of his life to. 'I started taking photos 10 years ago. I’d send photos back home to my mum and dad, who wanted to know where I was and how I was going,' Dan told Daily Mail Australia. The page quickly took off, surprising and delighting Dan as more and more people were keen to share their own photos and experiences of living in the outback. 'I had 1000 followers after a week, 40,000 after three months. I have 114,863 followers at the moment from all over the world,' he said. 'City people also wouldn’t have any idea what it’s like living in the country. We live under a tin roof and sleep on the ground.' The beautiful and raw photographs quickly drew the eye of Sydney-based publisher Brigitta Doyle, who was instantly riveted by the images on the Facebook page. 'It's incredible, so many Australians don’t know what it looks like. City people often don’t recognise that the photos are of Australia if you don’t tell them what it’s like,' said Dan . 'I go out to rodeos and race meets and photograph the real people from the country.' More than 32 million people have now viewed the site. Dan believes that part of the attraction is the fact that the page shows 'the true outback'. 'It's incredible, so many Australians don’t know what it looks like. City people often don’t recognise that the photos are of Australia if you don’t tell them what it’s like,' 'City people also wouldn’t have any idea what it’s like living in the country.

The beautiful and raw photographs quickly drew the eye of Sydney-based publisher Brigitta Doyle, who was instantly riveted by the images on the Facebook page. 'They're just people sharing the parts of their day that make them happy or make them sad. And I think that's really powerful. I just thought Dan's really special, and what he is creating is really special,' she told ABC Landline. 'They're just people sharing the parts of their day that make them happy or make them sad. And I think that's really powerful,' said Brigitta Doyle, the book's publisher . Outback Stations was released in September, and has taken off, with many Australians responding to the reality of outback Australian life as shown through the lens of those who live there. As a pictorial celebration of the real outback, Dan said that he was determined not to edit the pictures digitally. 'I don’t like doing all that photoshop stuff, I want to see the true photo. I don’t think photoshop can be better than the real thing,' he said. 'I’ve had no photography training. Even the big camera I have now, I wouldn’t know what half the buttons do,' 'I press a button and if the photo has taken properly then I’m lucky!' 'I go out to rodeos and race meets and photograph the real people from the country.' Dan said that one of the hardest part of putting the book together was choosing the right photographs to be included. 'We made a competition for people to send photos in of their properties, so we could show off stations all around Australia’s outback,' said Dan. For the hardworking cook, it has been a long road but an astoundingly quick success. 'Never in a million years would you think that it would become a book. Just incredible.

"The body of Margay Edwards, 27, has been found in the Nevada desert . The body of a 27-year-old woman from California has been found in the Nevada desert in a suspected homicide. Margay Edwards, from Los Osos, was found dead near a dirt track outside of Pahrump by two ATV riders last week. Clark County coroner's officials haven't released a cause of death. Nye County Detective Joe McGill did not say whether investigators have suspects or people of interest in the case. Edwards' license was found on her body, but her authorities are still looking for her cellphone and her car. 'There is a vehicle that was rented by the deceased, which is missing at this time and we need assistance to try to locate that vehicle,' McGill said. 'It's a 2014 metallic blue Hyundai Accent. 'The license plate number is (California) 7ESZ966.' Additionally, McGill said investigators also want to learn exactly who Edwards was with before she went missing more than a week ago, reports Review Journal. 'We know that she was seen in the Pahrump area on September 13,' he said. 'To the best of our knowledge, nobody has seen or spoken to her since. We do know that she had very loose ties to Pahrump. 'We're treating this as a criminal investigation.' Sheriff Tony DeMeo told KEYT-TV in Santa Barbara that Edwards had been staying in a hotel in Las Vegas. It was unclear whether she was alone or with friends. He said her family most recently contacted her in the second week of September. Her father Jeff Edwards said told San Luis Obispo his daughter was 'outgoing' and her sociable nature helped her in her work at Firestone Grill in San Luis Obispo, where she held various positions before moving to San Diego a couple of years ago to study business at San Diego State University. Deputies have called the death suspicious and are still looking for Edwards cellphone and blue 2014 Hyundai Accent. Pictured: The 27-year-old with the missing car . 'She hadn't settled on a specific career,' Jeff Edwards said. 'She liked sports and may have done something in that arena.' He said he last saw his daughter earlier in September, and didn't know how Margay ended up in Nevada. NBC 7 traced Edwards to a Vista apartment where she recently lived and were told by the current tenant told that San Diego County Sheriff's investigators visited there in April to asked her if she knew Edwards. The woman said investigators told her a vehicle registered to Edwards was involved in a hit-and-run crash in Las Vegas and police there were trying to track her down. Her body was in advanced stages of decomposition and it took four days to confirm it was Edwards. It is expected to take up to eight weeks to determine the cause of death.

"Scroll down for video . Clothes that are marketed as anti-odour could be harbouring a smelly secret, according to a new report. Socks and other items of clothing shown to be anti-odour in laboratories may not be once when they are put into real use next to human skin, the University of Alberta, Canada, study found. Antomicrobial textiles, those which kill or limit growth of microorganisms, may have almost no effect when used in the real world - meaning you might smell a whole lot more than you realise. Stinky secret: Socks and other items of clothing shown to be anti-odour in laboratories may not be once when they are put into real use next to human skin . In two separate experiments, Human Ecology researcher Rachel McQueen and her team found that some antimicrobial textiles were far more effective at performing their advertised tasks in the lab than in testing on humans. 'We aren't necessarily seeing the same results in the lab about antimicrobial activity translating into antimicrobial activity when we're wearing them next to our bodies in real life,' she said. Dr McQueen added that anything from sweat to the proteins in the human body can disrupt the antimicrobial properties of a fabric. 'In reality, when it goes to the point that it gets put on a textile, it may not have the same level of effectiveness as the ones they studied,' she said. Dr Rachel McQueen of the University of Alberta . In one experiment, the fabrics were designed to help lower the risk of infection, and in the second, the fabric was treated with a silver compound, which can be marketed as preventing odour in clothing. The first experiment analysed the effectiveness of three different textiles coated in antimicrobials triclosan, a zinc pyrithione derivative and a silver chloride-titanium dioxide compound. After putting the fabric on people's arms under plastic film for 24 hours, the compound hardly eliminated any bacteria. The second experiment had similar results, and tested whether polyester textiles treated with bioactive concentrations of an antimicrobial silver chloride compound reduced armpit odour and bacterial populations. Although lab testing showed antimicrobial activity, the treated fabrics did not lower odour or bacterial intensity when tested on people. Overall, the team found that the in vivo (tested on humans) results were not comparable with in vitro (tested in the lab) results in how they prevented microorganisms from surviving in the textile. Dr McQueen said the findings highlight the importance of in vivo testing, which is less common than in vitro testing, in textile product development. But, because the textiles appear to be effective at reducing bacteria in the lab, she said they can still be advertised as being anti-odorous, even when they are not when worn. So, for now, Dr McQueen suggests thinking twice before trusting textile's advertised claims. 'It's just a real spectrum to how effective they may truly be. So I'd probably say, from a consumer's point of view, if you're actually buying something that says it's antimicrobial, it may not be,' she said. 'I think that's important to consider in relation to a lot of claims made about textiles, that is, to be sceptical about the claims marketers make.'","Anti-odour textiles tested in labs do not actually work when used on people .

"The parents of a woman who died during childbirth having lost her unborn child have agreed a five-figure settlement with the hospital they blame for her death. Carly Harper, from West Kirby, Merseyside, died in May 2012 days after she was admitted to Arrowe Park Hospital. She was just 24 weeks pregnant when her waters broke. The hairdresser was expecting her first child with boyfriend Alex Dearden, when she developed severe sepsis - a life-threatening blood infection. Her family have today agreed a settlement ahead of the inquest into the 26-year-old's death, which opened today at Wirral Coroner's Court. She told staff at Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, she was in pain on the morning of May 19, apparently indicating her contractions had started early. Carly Harper, from West Kirby, Merseyside, died in May 2012 days after she was admitted to Arrowe Park Hospital. She was just 24 weeks pregnant when her waters broke and she gave birth to a stillborn son . Miss Harper went into hospital on May 19, 2012. An ultrasound scan showed her baby boy was dying and doctors decided to induce the birth . At 3.15pm on May 19, when an utlrasound scan showed Miss Harper’s baby boy was dying, doctors chose to induce the birth. But her family claim staff delayed inducing the labour and did not act quickly enough over signs that Miss Harper had a severe infection. It was not until 9.28pm that evening – more than six hours after the scan – that she gave birth to the stillborn boy. She was taken straight to intensive care and placed on a ventilator, but died of multiple organ failure at 9.10am the next day, with her family at her bedside. Her family claim the hospital, run by Wirral University Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, were negligent in caring for Miss Harper. Their lawyer James Thompson, of Simpson Millar solicitors, said: 'The family remains adamant that the admitted negligent obstetric treatment provided to Carly during the premature labour of her first child was to blame for her death. 'The family feels very strongly that it was a failure from staff at Arrowe Park Hospital to recognise, manage and treat the severe sepsis which led to Carly's death after she went into premature labour. 'The trust produced a Serious Incident Review Report, which recognised a number of failings in the care provided to Carly - including the failure of the obstetric team to respond with sufficient urgency to the seriousness of her condition. 'The window of time when Carly's life might have been saved was wasted and her family are now living with the consequences. 'The very least they deserve is absolute clarity about what happened on that fatal day, and to be reassured that steps are taken to prevent the senseless loss of such young lives again in the future. The trust admitted that 'there was a delay in delivering the deceased's foetus and in administering the second antibiotic as per Trust policy'. However, they did not accept their failings contributed to Miss Harper's death . The 26-year-old's family have today agreed a settlement ahead of the inquest into the 26-year-old's death, which opened today at Wirral Coroner's Court . 'It is Mr and Mrs Harper's firm belief that Carly died as a consequence of negligent medical treatment. And there was little involvement from the consultant until it was too late.' Robert Harper, who lives with Carly's mother Christine, said: 'When Carly began feeling unwell we became extremely worried. 'The evening of May 19, Christine stayed with her in hospital and I went home - my wife called me later on to say that it wasn't looking good but told me to stay at home. 'But at 1.30am that night, she called again and said you better get here fast. 'When I saw Carly in the ICU my first words were ""my god, what have they done to her"". I just couldn't understand what had happened. 'I phoned Carly's sister Kimberley and she brought her brother Tommy down to the hospital straight away. Matthew was away training with the army and he didn't make it in time.' In reaching a settlement with Mr and Mrs Harper, the trust admitted that ""there was a delay in delivering the deceased's foetus and in administering the second antibiotic as per Trust policy"". However, they did not accept that their failings contributed to Carly's death. The inquest into her death is due to be held over three days before coroner David Lewis who will hear evidence from clinicians that were responsible for Miss Harper's care.","Carly Harper was admitted to Arrowe Park Hospital, Merseyside on May 19 .

"A gunman who was persuaded by a bookkeeper to surrender during a 2013 gun battle with police at a school near Atlanta pleaded guilty to multiple charges Tuesday and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Michael Brandon Hill, 21, entered the Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy near Decatur on Aug. 20, 2013, armed with a rifle patterned after an AK-47 and nearly 500 bullets, according to police. He repeatedly fired at police from inside the school before school bookkeeper Antoinette Tuff persuaded him to surrender. Tuff said later that she prayed as she tried to persuade him against further violence. No one was hurt in the gunfire. Michael Brandon Hill sits at the defense table in court during his  hearing pleaded guilty to multiple charges and was sentenced to 20 years in prison . 'Her actions saved a number of lives out there at the school that day,' said Roderick Wilkerson, deputy chief assistant for the Stone Mountain district attorney's office. Hill's defense attorney, Annie Deets, said Hill has a history of mental illness that started when he was 7. Deets said Hill was abused by his late father and lived with a mother who abused drugs and alcohol. He tried killing himself at least nine times, and he was in and out of state custody as a child. He turned up at area hospitals seeking psychiatric medication. Hill entered the Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy near Decatur on Aug. 20, 2013, armed with a rifle patterned after an AK-47 and nearly 500 bullets, according to police . Months before Hill attacked the school, he was burned in an apartment fire and became homeless. 'Mr. Hill's only intention that day was to harm himself,' Deets said. She . said Hill did not fire any shots close to the police officers who . quickly swarmed the school.

Hill said little during the sentencing hearing. At times, he rocked slightly in a courtroom chair. Tapes . of 911 calls revealed Tuff's calm intervention. Antoinette Tuff said: 'And I just explained to him that I loved him. I didn't know much about him. I didn't know his name but I did love him and it was scary because I knew at that moment he was ready to take my life along with his' Hero: Secretary Antoinette Tuff is seen here in her office at Ronald E.

Courage under fire: Antoinette Tuff, a book-keeper at the elementary school near Atlanta, talked calmly to the gunman standing in front of her and got him to lay down his weapon . She begins by telling . Hill of her own struggles, including raising a disabled child and losing . her husband. The bookkeeper reassured him by saying he didn't hurt . anyone, hadn't harmed her and could still surrender peacefully. 'We're . not gonna hate you, baby. It's a good thing that you're giving up,' Tuff says after having Hill put his weapons and ammunition on the . counter. Tuff tells Hill she loves him and will pray for him. President Barack Obama later called Tuff and praised her for the courage she displayed during the ordeal. Hill . pleaded guilty in DeKalb County Superior Court to 13 counts including . aggravated assault, burglary, making terroristic threats, carrying a gun . in a school zone and illegal possession of a firearm. The school, a few miles east of Atlanta, has more than 800 students in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade.

"Belgian Bob Peeters has been named as the new manager of Charlton Athletic. The former Millwall striker replaces Jose Riga in the Addicks' hotseat and was confirmed as Charlton's new head coach on Tuesday evening. The 40-year-old arrives at The Valley from Waasland-Beveren who play in the Belgian top-flight. Appointed: Ex-Millwall striker Bob Peeters has been confirmed as the new boss of Charlton Athletic . Gone: Jose Riga left Charlton with his contract due to expire this summer . Former boss Riga, 56, was only appointed as manager by new owner Roland Duchatelet in March with the Addicks staring at relegation from the Championship. And even though Riga won three of the last four matches to save Charlton, the club decided to let him leave ahead of his contract expiring this summer. The swift change in management shouldn't come as a surprise under Duchatelet's stewardship, with the owner renowned for tinkering. Chris Powell was sacked by the club two months ago, while captain Johnnie Jackson insistent that Riga should have remained with the club ahead of next season. 'He has been good since he came in,' Jackson said earlier this month. 'You can see the way he wants to play and he understands the Championship. If he was given time to implement his methods, we would have the making of a good side.'

"A Sunday teacher has been charged with abusing a teenage boy after an investigation by an investigation by Eubank Sheriff's Department in Kentucky. Rex Allen Murphy, 30, has been charged with first-degree sexual abuse, use of a minor under 18 for sexual performance and third-degree sodomy. Murphy was taken into custody and is being held in Pulaski County Detention Center where he is being held on a bond of $50,000. Rex Allen Murphy, pictured, was arrested on Monday night after the teenage boy approached authorities . According to Somerset-Kentucky.com Murphy was a Sunday school teacher at the Polly Ann Church of God in Eubank. Linville Dalton, pastor at the church said 'the situation is being handled internally.' He said that Murphy was only a Sunday school teacher at the church and had been removed of his teaching duties. The investigation was launched after the young victim reported the abuse authorities. Murphy was arrested on Monday night and taken into custody shortly after 10pm. According to Colin Hatfield, Eubank Chief of Police, his department launched the investigation on Friday after the youngster came forward. According to Chief Hatfield: ' The details were very graphic and to the point. Upon tracking down the suspect, Rex Allen Murphy  and interviewing him, he did in fact confess to the allegations.' He added that due to the severity of the case most details are being withheld. Chief Hatfield said: 'The victim stated that the suspect told him on numerous occasions that by brushing his skin or shaking his hand…he could tell his sins by the power he has. He comes from family of warlocks. 'He was very scared, because the suspect, in the victim’s eyes, had been threatening his life in the form of Wicca, witchcraft, black magic.'

"Five policemen were killed and 12 more wounded when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive vest at the the entrance to a concert hall in Chechnya yesterday. The suicide bomber was wearing a police uniform and presented police credentials as he tried to go through metal detectors set up outside the concert hall in Grozny, the capital. When police moved to stop him, he detonated the explosives. No civilians were reported wounded. Scroll down for video . Dead bodies of police officers who prevented a terrorist attack lie on the floor in Grozny, Chechnya, yesterday . The five policemen were killed when they went to check on an individual who was acting suspiciously . Despite two separatist wars in the 1990s and a festering Islamic insurgency, Chechnya has seen a period of relative calm under the rule of Moscow-backed Ramzan Kadyrov, and suicide bombings have been fewer in recent years. The concert hall where the attack was launched was due to host festivities planned to celebrate Grozny's city day holiday, which is also Mr Kadyrov's birthday. 'Police officers who were manning metal detectors at the entrance of the concert hall noticed a suspicious young man,' a local police officer told RIA news agency. 'When the police officers decided to check the individual, the man blew himself up.' The attacker was identified as Opti Mudarov, a 19-year-old resident of Grozny, BBC News reports. He reportedly disappeared two months ago, breaking contact with his family. The concert hall attacked was due to host festivities celebrating Grozny's city day holiday . Police cover the bodies of their colleagues. Right, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov . Following the Chechen separatist wars in 1994-96 and 1999-2000, an insurgency spread across the predominantly Muslim North Caucasus, fuelled by anger over corruption and alleged rights abuses. Yesterday's attack was the first major act of violence since the death of insurgent leader Doku Umarov who was killed in a clampdown during Russia's hosting of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, on the western edge of the Caucasus Mountains. Mr Kadyrov, who has been threatened personally by the insurgents, who call themselves the Caucasus Emirate, has vowed to wipe out the militants. But he has faced criticism from human rights groups for torture and disappearances of those suspected of being linked to the insurgency. He calls the accusations an attempt to blacken his name. The last suicide bombings in Russia took place late last year in Volgograd, a city north of the volatile Caucasus region. The last suicide bombing in Grozny was in 2012 and killed at least four soldiers. In Kabardino-Balkaria, nearly 125 miles west of Chechnya, security officials also killed two militants on Sunday, Russian state TV said.

"It is the most expensively assembled forward line ever to contest a Champions League final and Real Madrid are desperate for Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale to give them their money's worth in Lisbon on Saturday and finally deliver the club's 10th European Cup. The strike-force the Spanish have dubbed the ‘BBC’ — Bale, [Karim] Benzema and Cristiano — was assembled at a cost of £187million, with Bale and Ronaldo alone arriving for £165m. Madrid’s overall spend since the turn of the century is more than £1.2billion (£999m alone in the past 12 years), an extraordinary outlay but one that has delivered a solitary European Cup back in 2002. Finding his feet: Bale has shone since his £85million move from Tottenham last summer . Influential: Bale admits he is learning 'a bit of everything' from Cristiano Ronaldo . In form: Frenchman Karim Benzema netted 17 La Liga goals for Real Madrid last season . Bale and Ronaldo’s mission against city rivals Atletico is to make it more than just one in a billion and give Real a slice of history as the first club to win Europe’s elite competition 10 times. The intense pressure Real put themselves under every season to deliver the biggest prize is felt by all at the club, but perhaps less by their two galacticos — Ronaldo because he won the European Cup in 2008 and Bale because he is still in his first season in Madrid. The Welshman has already put one trophy in the cabinet with his sensational late winner against Barcelona at the Copa del Rey final in Mestalla. Yet nothing explains president Florentino Perez’s short fuse with his coaches quite like the failure even to reach a European Cup final since 2002. He went down to the dressing room after Real blew La Liga last weekend against Celta Vigo and let it be known that he was unhappy at the way they were finishing the season. It was seen as a clear sign of how the pressure had got to him. This season could be historic — or no more than just a year they won the Spanish Cup. There are rumours Perez will walk away if Real do not win in Lisbon. If he does not go, coach Carlo Ancelotti might well have to leave instead. Someone will have to pay. With Ronaldo missing Saturday’s 3-1 league win against Espanyol, when Bale scored Real’s opener, there are also concerns that central defender Pepe is unlikely to be fully fit for the final. With Xabi Alonso ruled out through suspension, Madrid’s dependable spine is severely splintered. Jumping for joy: Bale leaps into the air after scoring against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final . Pressure: Real boss Carlo Ancelotti could leave the club if he fails to win the Champions League . Stepping up: Bale celebrates scoring the opening goal against Espanyol with team-mate Angel Di Maria . If Pepe fails a late test, Raphael Varane will step in against Atletico, but the young French defender has hardly played this season having failed to recover from a knee operation. Asier Illarramendi will step in for Alonso after an unconvincing first season following his 30m euros signing from Real Sociedad. The hope among Real Madrid supporters is that none of this will matter because Bale and Ronaldo will work their magic on the Champion League’s meanest defence and paper over the other cracks that have appeared in recent weeks. As Pep Guardiola lamented after Real Madrid embarrassed Bayern Munich in the semi-finals: ‘They are footballers but they are also supreme athletes; even if you had the fastest defence in football you wouldn’t be able to stop them.’ Bale and Ronaldo hit it off from day one at Madrid when, in a well-meaning if slightly forced photo-opportunity, Ronaldo greeted new boy Bale in the club car park on his first day of training. Bale moved into the same exclusive ‘La Finca’ neighbourhood as Ronaldo on his new team-mate’s advice, renting a property for about £9,800 a month no more than 500 metres from the Portuguese  player’s house. Deadly duo: Bale and Ronaldo have helped fire Madrid into their first Champions League final for 12 years . Back of the net: Ronaldo scores Real's third goal in their Champions League semi-final win over Bayern Munich . ‘Cristiano is the boss here,’ said Bale in one of his first interviews in Spain. ‘He is the best in the world and I want to learn from him.’ The only time the pecking order has changed has been when Ronaldo has been injured and Bale has stepped impressively into his shoes as the team’s goalscoring talisman. The greatest example of that came with his solo goal in that Copa del Rey final. The Welshman got a taste of the delirium that such successes provoke in Spain’s capital when he was welcomed by thousands of celebrating supporters during a 4am open-top bus ride through the city. ‘It was mind-blowing to see how many people there were that night in the middle of a week,’ he said. ‘It gives you a taste and you want more; if we can win more trophies then it will be a lot bigger.’ Next Sunday has already been pencilled in as a day of celebration in the ‘Real’ half of Madrid if they can emulate the side led by Zinedine Zidane in Glasgow in 2002 and carry off the European Cup. Zidane will be on the touchline at Lisbon’s Estadio de Luz as Ancelotti’s assistant, having been instrumental in bringing Bale to the club in the first place. On the run: Bale skips away from Bayern winger Franck Ribery at the Allianz Arena . Silverware: Bale celebrates the first trophy of his career with former Spurs team-mate Luka Modric . ‘Zidane’s one of the best players ever and he was there to welcome me on the first day,’ said Bale, who has also praised former Spurs team-mate Luka Modric for the way he has helped him settle in his first year.  But the special relationship appears to be with Ronaldo. ‘Since the first step that I made into Real Madrid he’s been amazing with me, giving me advice on and off the pitch.’ Ronaldo insists the admiration is mutual. ‘He has played brilliantly in all three competitions’ he told UEFA last week. ‘I am able to speak English with him and we’ve just naturally become friends. I always liked him as a player and now that I know him personally, I like him even more.’ Both men are perfect galacticos because in spite of all the glitz and glamour on the pitch there is little cause for gossip off it. Passion: Bale screams with delight after scoring to help seal his first trophy win in Spain . Ronaldo’s preference for 300 sit-ups in the private gym of his seven-bedroom mansion over any late-night ‘fiestas’ is famed. Bale has limited his appearances in the city to official club trips such as the players’ visit to the Madrid Masters tennis last week. There has been no partying but that will change next weekend if, after just eight months, Bale helps land the trophy Real have been chasing for 12 years. The weekly Spanish lessons in a private classroom at the Valdebebas training ground have yet to prepare Bale sufficiently for him to face the local Press in their language, but there is one word he knows all too well: ‘La Decima’, the 10th. They have paid more than a billion to win it and they believe in six days’ time it will be theirs. The last 100m euros spent on Bale may even turn out to be the most important of all.","Real Madrid have spent over £1.2billion on players since 2000 .

"In what could be a pioneering move for air travel, one airline has decided to combat the problem of bland in-flight food by pairing music to meals. It may sound like an unusual idea,  but the method has backing from scientific research, with an Oxford professor suggesting the right music can influence tastebuds. To put it to the test, British Airways created a unique Sound Bite soundtrack, for customers dining at 35,000 feet . British Airways has created a unique Sound Bite soundtrack based on an Oxford University study which revealed that specific music can alter the taste of specific food and drink . Dining at 35,000 feet: The ability to taste is reduced by 30% in the air .

Lily Allen and Coldplay are among the choices for main meals, as the findings claim that 'British food and music belong together'. For those choosing a hearty main, Debussy is available, since classical music is perfectly paired with roast-style dinners. For dessert, high-pitch tones from James Blunt and Madonna bring out the sweet flavours. Sonic seasoning can also have an effect on drinking wine, with classical and rock music said to enhance perception of quality and depth of flavour.

The Pretenders have been chosen to accompany red wines, as they can make it appear more 'robust' and 'heavy', while white wine is served with The BBC Symphony Orchestra, since classical music can enhance the perception of its quality. To round off the meal the low tones of Tenor Domingo are a great match for coffee. Professor Charles Spence from Oxford University, who conducted the study, said: 'In the coming months and years we are going to see far more interest in the matching of music and soundscape to what we eat and drink. The low tones of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong can complement savoury starters . For dessert (right), high-pitch tones from James Blunt can bring out the sweet flavours . 'I think that it is a really exciting and innovative development to see British Airways taking the first steps in this direction.'

Despite having no formal engineering training, Sodden created the first tankchair in his own garage using caterpillar tracks instead of wheels, so that driver could traverse most types of terrain, including low lying water and even snow. Scroll Down for Video . Revolutionary: Brad Soden with two versions of his 'Tankchair' which retails for up to $15,000 and has brought joy to hundreds of wounded and disabled veterans . 'When you're in a wheelchair, it’s not just your problem,' said Soden to AZFamily. 'It’s a family problem because the family has to deal with it.' 'My poor wife. She tried to keep going and the wheelchair kept getting stuck,' he said. 'Our kids trying to push her, and get her going, and she started crying, said go on without me, and I just found that unacceptable.' His first attempt at a modified wheelchair for his wife was based on an off-road cart, but he abandoned this because they would not be allowed at the majority of campgrounds nationwide because of their noise and restrictions on gas. Devoted husband: Brad was determined to allow his wife Liz to be able to come camping along with their five children . His father-in-law was the one who gave him inspiration when he asked, 'Wouldn't it be cool if you could put tracks on that like a tank?' Soden, who had prior military experience as an infantryman who worked on tracked vehicles, used trial and error before his first genuine prototype was presented to his wife. 'The 10 million jumbo watt smile she had on her face when she came back from her hike was worth every minute I spent in the garage putting it together,' said Soden to KTAR. Since then, Tankchair has expanded to improve the design of his invention with the help of Arizona firm, NPC Robotics and began selling the chairs. He noticed that a large majority of his clients for his customized chairs were injured servicemen and women. Celebrity backers: Bill O'Reilly with Brad and Liz (left) and Brad with Pearl Jam lead singer, Eddie Vedder . Relief: Each chair is customized to the user's specifications and cost upwards of $15,000 and are all assembled in Brad Soden's own garage . Each tankchair is built to order and costs around $15,000 and many of the parts are assembled by Soden in his own garage. According to the Washington Post he has built versions that incorporate a fishing rod and a text-to-speech system for one man who was unable to speak. Another version was built for a cop complete with an LED Incapacitator, which induces vomiting in suspects by flashing a pulsating light at them. 'The best part about building that one,' he said to the Washington Post, 'was that it helped the injured client, who was a cop, get back being a cop again.' Joy: This veteran has taken delivery of his own 'Tankchair' and is now getting ready for his test-drive . All weather terrain: The beauty of the tank chair is the ability to traverse all manner of outdoor environments . Inspiration: Brad was consulted by the makers of the Pixar smash hit movie Wall-E . So original was his idea that Soden was approached by the makers of the Pixar film Wall-E, who wanted his help in directing their artists to get the correct feel for the titular hero. And over the next few weeks, Soden will be traveling the country delivering five new tankchairs to veterans backed by an NFl Hall of Famers initiative to get more disabled servicemen and women the chairs. Since his wife's accident 15-years-ago, Soden has developed his chair to the point where he is testing a new model that could be capable of traveling up to 30 mph. He calls it the Speedster according to the Washington Post, likening it to a Ferrari, whereas he calls the tankchair a 'truck'. 'For the longest time, we’ve been used to wheelchairs that limit people,' said Soden to the Washington Post. 'For me, it’s about changing the way people think about where you can go and what you can do with them.'","Phoenix ex-serviceman Brad Soden built first prototype 10-years-ago .

"Joromie Lewis (pictured) died after taking a mouthful of pear drink shipped from the Caribbean which contained lethal levels of cocaine, an inquest heard . A Royal Navy veteran died after drinking a mouthful from a pear drink shipped from the Caribbean which contained cocaine in a concentration at least 20 times the lethal level, an inquest has heard. Joromie Lewis, 33, of Gosport, Hampshire, became ill after trying the drink which he spat out because of its bitter taste. Mr Lewis, who was working at a food import company, consumed the drink in Southampton on December 5 last year and died that night at Southampton General Hospital. The inquest jury heard how tests showed that the drink, called Pear D - imported by his employer Kelly's Shipping UK Ltd on behalf of a client - contained an 'overwhelmingly high' concentration of cocaine. Graham Short, coroner for Central Hampshire, said: 'Joromie worked for a company which imported food and drink from the Caribbean and distributed them in this country. He was a driver and general assistant working mainly on a part-time basis. 'On December 5 2013, Joromie drank from a bottle at his employer's garage where he was unpacking a delivery of drinks. The bottle was labelled Pear D, a form of pear cordial not normally available in this country. 'He took only one mouthful and he felt it tasted bitter and spat it out. 'After this he started to feel unwell and he was taken to hospital by his friends. He died later the same day at Southampton General Hospital. 'Tests of the contents of the bottle showed it had a very high concentration of the drug cocaine in solution.' Basil Purdue, a Home Office pathologist, said he had been informed that Mr Lewis consumed the drink at the home of his employer and fell ill immediately. He said the bottle was part of a consignment of 90 cases imported from the island of St Vincent but the bottle had tested for dissolved cocaine - a smuggling method for the drug. He said Mr Lewis was a healthy man whose only medical issue had been a problem with his back which had led to him receiving a medical discharge from the Navy in 2012. Dr Purdue said: 'Joromie had inadvertently taken a swig and no more than that from one of the bottles.' He said Mr Lewis was obviously ill as he began to shake and collapse and was rushed to hospital by his friends. Stating that the cause of death was cocaine intoxication, Dr Purdue said toxicology tests showed that Mr Lewis had a 'very high' cocaine level of 21.3mg per litre of blood, with a fatal level being as low as 1mg. The drink would have contained 1g of cocaine in 3ml of liquid. He compared the level to that of a drug smuggler who died after four cocaine packages burst in his stomach, leaving him with a level of 4mg/l. Joromie Lewis, 33, of Gosport, Hampshire, became ill after trying the drink which he spat out because of its bitter taste . Dr Purdue said that as a 'naive user' - someone who was not a cocaine user - the drug would have had a greater effect, and added: 'We are dealing with an overwhelming overdose of the drug.' He added that one of Mr Lewis's colleagues put some of the liquid on his tongue and it caused it to go numb for three hours. Juanette Allen, company secretary of Kelly's Shipping UK Ltd, said the firm imported drinks from the Caribbean at the request of customers. She said: 'In this case we didn't source the drink, we just facilitated the process of bringing it from St Vincent to the UK.' She explained that the van-load of drinks arrived at Portsmouth docks on November 24 and, once duties had been paid, Mr Lewis collected it two days later and took it to the garage at Ms Allen's home in Southampton where the company is based. She said the company had not ordered any Pear D drink and she had not come across the brand before. She told the hearing at Winchester Coroner's Court that the client paid £750 for the consignment. Ms Allen said: 'I was familiar with a drink called Pear Drops and I assumed it was linked to this drink.' She said Mr Lewis arrived at her home at about 6.30pm with a colleague, Carlos Deabreu, with a van of items collected for export. She said he picked up a bottle to drink, which he was allowed to do, and she saw him in the kitchen drinking a mouthful from it. She said: 'When he had a sip of it he said it didn't taste right. I am not sure if he swallowed because he went out to the sink, I do not know how much he swallowed. 'He was trying to get it all out, trying to make himself sick. I asked him when he said it didn't taste right, I asked him if he broke the seal on the bottle, he said yes.' She said he complained of the bitter taste from the drink which he pointed out was not carbonated as it should have been and asked for some sugar to get rid of the taste. She told the hearing Mr Lewis had said he wanted to get the contents of the bottle tested at a hospital and he left with her partner, Phillon Kelly, and Mr Deabreu before he began showing physical problems. Ms Allen said she heard Mr Lewis say to Mr Kelly: 'Do not let those people use you.' She said: 'He was probably thinking this bottle that he had a drink from probably had come from the customer and they knew exactly what was in the bottle and the company was using the company to get them.' She added: 'Probably we were a bit naive, it's not something we thought someone would try to do to us. 'Since this incident we have not imported any drinks, not for the customer, not for ourselves. We have taken the decision that any drink we have to source ourselves.' Ms Allen said she had known Mr Lewis, who was paid £10-an-hour for his work, since they had both lived in St Vincent and they had joined the Navy at the same time. Carole Willis of Hampshire Scientific Services said an examination showed the bottle contained 189g of cocaine. Detective Sergeant Glyn White, of Hampshire Police, said Mr Lewis was taken to Royal South Hants Hospital by Mr Deabreu but because it did not have an accident and emergency department he was taken by ambulance to Southampton General Hospital. He said: 'Carlos steps around the vehicle to open the door for Joromie who by this stage already appears to be beginning to fit. He's not able to exit the vehicle and collapses.' Det Sgt White said that once the danger of the drink had been established, the Food Standards Agency issued an alert to local authorities to check for bottles which might have reached shops in the UK. The jury heard that the pear fruit drink containing deadly levels of cocaine had a street value of up to £50,000. He said the rest of the consignment was not recovered, including other bottles of Pear D imported at the same time, and he believed that someone slipped the contaminated bottle into the crates being exported. He said the customer, a Samantha McDadi, was investigated but not traced, with her telephone number and email address no longer in use, and he added that he did not believe this was a genuine identity. The inquest continues.","Joromie Lewis died after drinking a mouthful of the liquid in Southampton .

"Gerard Phillip Caleo, the general manager of the Hard Rock Cafe at Phuket resort in Thailand, has appeared in a Sydney court charged with the stabbing murder of his sister-in-law Rita Caleo in  1990, when he was just 18 years old. Ms Caleo was stabbed to death in the ensuite bathroom of her Double Bay home, in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs, in the early hours of August 10, 1990, while her four-year-old son and infant daughter were sleeping in an adjacent bedroom. The children's nanny found the body of Ms Caleo, who was well known in business circles in Sydney, after being woken by noises. Scroll down for video . Stabbed while her children slept: Rita Caleo (above) was a successful businesswomen and married mother-of-two when she was brutally stabbed to death in her home ,in Sydney's exclusive Double Bay, as her two young children slept nearby. She was murdered just ten months after her brother, wealthy doctor, Michael Chye was show dead in his Mercedes Benz . Arrested: Gerard Caleo, 42, is accompanied by NSW Police through Sydney Airport after they arrested him when he flew in on August 15 from Malaysia. Caleo appeared in a Sydney court on Tuesday charged with the murder 24 years ago of his sister-in-law when he was an 18-year-old . Still a mystery: Rita Caleo was murdered just ten months after the gangland-style killing of her brother, Dr Michael Chye (pictured) despite an inquest and extensive investigations, police had no luck until the breakthrough in August, when they made an arrest for the Rota Caleo murder . The 39-year-old was murdered ten months after her millionaire brother, Dr Michael Chye,was gunned down on October 16, 1989 as he sat in his Mercedes Benz in the garage of his Woollahra home, another affluent suburb in Sydney's east. Gerard Caleo, 42, appeared in Central Local Court in Sydney charged with the murder of Ms Caleo, whose husband, Mark Caleo, was working at his Italian restaurants in Sydney at the time of the murder. NSW Homicide Squad detectives arrested Gerard Caleo on August 15 this year, after he flew into Sydney Airport from Kuala Lumpur. Flown in: Gerard Caleo flies in to Sydney Airport on August 15, when he is arrested (pictured) and taken into custody over the murder of his sister-in-law Rita Caleo, who was stabbed to death at her Sydney home while her children slept in the next door bedroom in August 1990 . Top job: Gerard Caleo was the general manager of Hard Rock Cafe in Phuket (pictured), a popular venue located at Patong Beach in the Thai resort which fostered the local music scene. Caleo is the brother of onetime Sydney restaurateur, Mark Caleo, whose Malaysian-born wife Gerard is now accused of murdering . Caleo was charged with solicitation to commit murder, accessory before the fact to murder and accessory after the fact to murder, and remanded in custody. Detectives investigating the murders during the 1990s had several leads on who might want to kill the victims, who were the children of a senior Malaysian police officer and whose deaths attracted considerable media coverage there and in Australia. Dr Chye's 1991 inquest heard that he had given evidence to the Hong Kong Independent Commission Against Corruption about a multi- million dollar bank fraud. Cold cases: The mystery of the two murders ten months apart of wealthy Sydney doctor Michael Chye (above, left) and his sister, Rita, has frustrated detectives for more than two decades, but now Rita's brother-in-law Gerard Caleo (pictured, right) has been arrested and charged with her stabbing death . The inquest was also told about a property dispute between Dr Chye, his sister and her husband over a $3.6 million house in southern Sydney. Ms Caleo's inquest was told that in the months leading up to her death, Ms Caleo had feared she might be killed and had given her solicitor a sealed envelope, on which she had written, 'to be opened only if my death is unnatural'. Following her murder, police read a note in which she listed the names of two people she said had organised the execution-style murder of her brother. Slotted: Handcuffed and under arrest, former Hard Rock Cafe general manager, Gerard Caleo, is put into a police van and taken into custody after jetting into Sydney Airport from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . However, the NSW coroner, Kevin Waller, said  that the evidence presented by the letter failed to establish a prima facie case against any known person. The NSW Police Force’s Unsolved Homicide squad began re-examining the murders in 2008. Gerard Caleo appeared in court on Tuesday charged with murder and was remanded in custody.

"Foreign drivers have escaped £2.3 million in speeding fines since January last year, figures have revealed. Nearly 23,300 speeding offences have been caught on camera in England and Wales, however police have been unable to pursue the drivers as their vehicles are not registered with the DVLA. It is feared the actual figures could be nearly double the amount as only half of police authorities supplied figures. Foreign criminals: Nearly 23,300 speeding offences have been caught on camera in England and Wales, however police have been unable to pursue the drivers as their vehicles are not registered with the DVLA . Drivers of foreign vehicles do not have to register their cars with the DVLA until it has been in the UK for six months, however this is hard to police. As a result, a large number of drivers with unregistered cars are able to commit speeding offences without having to pay up, risking lives on the road. In Kent, one foreign motorist was caught travelling at 111mph on the M25, while a camera on the A3 Hook Road in Surrey recorded a driver travelling at 109mph in a 50mph zone, a spokesman for road safety charity the Institute of Advanced Motorists said. Thames Valley recorded the highest number of offences with 3,580 drivers caught speeding. This was followed by Merseyside with 2,477, Warwickshire whose cameras registered 2,152 offences, Gwent with 2,090 and Kent recorded 1,954 speeding offences committed by foreign drivers. One way to do it: Police can physically stop a foreign registered vehicle which is breaking UK law and charge an on the spot fine, but budget cuts see authorities rely on cameras on most roads . The Metropolitan Police area, covering 32 London boroughs, came in at sixth place with 1,586 offences taking place across the Greater London area, with the worst offence recorded on the A406 North Circular Road, southbound, when a driver was caught travelling 98mph in a 50mph zone. Neil Greig, IAM’s director of policy and research, said: ‘The high numbers of overseas speeders on our roads show how important it is that the UK joins up with the rest of Europe to harmonise motoring offences and give the police extra powers to pursue dangerous drivers. ‘Progress on this issue has been very slow and in the meantime thousands of drivers are avoiding fines and bans simply because their cars cannot be easily traced.’ The figures were released following a freedom of information (FOI) request to police authorities in England and Wales by IAM. Although the FOI request was made to 40 police authorities across England and Wales, only 23 supplied results. Those which did not reply included Avon and Somerset, Cleveland, Essex, Lincolnshire, West Yorkshire and Wiltshire. In May, the European Court changed the basis of the EU directive on cross border enforcement so that the UK could no longer opt out. It covers mutual access to information to trace vehicle owners involved in eight road safety offences - speeding, seat belt use, driving through red traffic lights, drink driving, drug driving, helmet use, use of forbidden lanes and mobile phone use. Detailed negotiations are now under way at European level to implement the changes but a date for the UK has not been set, according to IAM. Tim Shallcross, head of technical policy for IAM, said a change in the law would not only tackle the problem of drivers of foreign vehicles escaping speeding fines but it would also act as a deterrent. Hidden figures: It is thought the number of foreign drivers escaping fines is much higher than 23,295 as only 23 of 40 police authorities released their figures . He said: ‘We want to clamp down on people who are flouting our road safety laws knowing that they are not going to be traced. ‘We believe that most foreign drivers do drive sensibly but we want to clamp down on the tiny minority who are not.’ Edmund King, AA President, said: ‘It is worrying that so many drivers from overseas feel that they can speed through the UK with impunity. ‘Police do have the powers to stop and sanction drivers of vehicles with foreign plates if they are breaking the law. ‘We would like to see some proactive targeting of these dangerous drivers. ‘The figures come as no surprise as we don’t yet have cross border enforcement using the EU nation’s vehicle registers. ‘This may change if a revised directive succeeds in the EU (in 2015) - the UK opted out of the previous one along with Denmark and Ireland but will be forced to take part in the next one.’ Mr King said this would be ideal for the UK as it would allow it to send speeding penalties to the EC vehicle keepers. He said: ‘Of course, the police can physically stop a foreign registered vehicle which is breaking UK law and charge an on the spot fine, but of course we now have fewer traffic police and place greater reliance on cameras. ‘The problem with cross border enforcement is it could become just a money-related system of fines which won’t in itself help road safety as licence endorsements are also needed to change attitudes.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Nearly 23,300 offences committed by overseas drivers since January 2013 .

"Fernando Torres scored in Spain's 2-0 win over Bolivia on Friday night and could have scored a brace but for a horror miss. The striker timed his run impeccably to latch on to an exquisite Andres Iniesta through ball and, with just the keeper to beat, looked certain to score. However, attempting to delicately chip the ball over the head of Boliva stopper Romel Quininez with the outside of his boot, Torres instead sent the ball high and wide in the opposite direction.

Referee: Lorenc Jemini (Albania) Torres immediately put his hands to his head after completely misdirecting the ball. The Chelsea attacker has struggled for form having signed for the Blues in a £50million deal from Liverpool back in January 2011. Despite this miss, Torres did get himself on the scoresheet with a well-taken penalty five minutes into the second half of Spain's penultimate World Cup warm-up match. Bolivia, who failed to qualify for the World Cup finals, had managed to hold out until half-time before Javi Martinez was bundled over in the penalty area and Torres calmly slotted home the resulting spot-kick. Having scored a paltry 20 goals in 110 appearances for Chelsea, Torres' penalty was the forward's 37th goal in 107 appearances for Spain. Iniesta got the second to make sure of the victory, showing his class as he surged forward in the 84th minute and curled a low effort in off the post. Pointing the way: Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta celebrates after scoring Spain's second goal . 'It's always much better to travel (to a major tournament) with good feelings,' Iniesta said in an interview with Spanish television broadcaster Cuatro. 'We worked well and the conclusions from the game are positive.' 'The season has been very demanding and we have a lot of matches under our belts but what we have ahead of us is sufficiently exciting and different.' Spain were missing their Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid contingent, who are on holiday following their clash in Saturday's Champions League final and will join up with the rest of the squad on Monday.","Fernando Torres hit horror miss during Spain's friendly win over Bolivia .

"Rob Evans was with his friend checking on crab pots . A salt water crocodile who didn't like the look of two men lurking around his muddy creek bed obviously wasn't up for negotiating his territory when he set out after them in Australia's top end. The two fisherman who'd set out on a trip to check the status of their crab pots were minding their own business when a disgruntled visitor slipped beneath the surface of Mitchell Creek, near Darwin, before making a beeline for their boat. Capturing the moment the croc slipped under the muddy surface was Rob Evans - a fisherman who uploaded the footage to Facebook. He commented during the 35 second clip that the inquisitive creature was 'coming out to see us' before he flicked the engine switch on his boat and idled away in the opposite direction. 'Ah, s*** he's coming straight for us,' Mr Evan's co fisherman said when he spotted the croc. 'He's after us.' Mr Evans wrote the trip was all 'fun and games' until their unexpected crocodile encounter in a part of the country teeming with the salt water reptiles. Scroll down for video . The  crocodile Mr Evans estimated to be about four metres which came after he and a fisherman in Australia's top end . He said the 'little bugger' who he estimated to be about four metres long was sitting right near the float of their crab trap that they'd initially set out to check on. 'The little bugger was sitting right next to the float,' he said. When Mr Evans quickly noticed the  speed and direction with which the crocodile was taking he quickly began motoring off in the opposite direction. 'F*** that, I'm getting out of here,' he said, before signing off  'see ya later buddy.' The crocodile can be seen making ripples in the water as it swims towards the boat in the Mitchell Creek . The four metre crocodile was in the Mitchell Creek which runs into Darwin Harbour . A man was earlier attacked by a crocodile near Peppimenarti this month . This latest croc encounter comes just days after a Northern Territory man told how he was taken on a 'death roll' as he hunted near a creek but managed to escape when he poked the beast in the eye. Stephen Moreen, 20, was hunting pigs, geese and emu in Peppimenarti, 320 kilometres south-west of Darwin, in the Northern Territory, when he waded into the water to collect a water fowl a member of the group he was with had shot. He was in a two metres of water when the crocodile struck, latching its giant jaws on to his arm. Mr Moreen told the ABC that at he drank some beer to numb the pain as he waited to be airlifted to the Royal Darwin Hospital. 'I wasn't too worried until I saw the scars,' he said. 'It made me cry. I'm fine, I'm alive. It could have been bad. It could have got my leg. I was about waist deep. 'I have a scratch on my back, the rest on my arm. He ripped out a bit of skin and left me with two to three holes.'","Rob Evans filmed he and a friend being taunted by a crocodile .

"Chloe Madeley revealed today that she ‘wanted to stand up against’ vile Twitter trolls as she was seen in public for the first time since they threatened to rape her. Online bullies turned on the 27-year-old after her mother Judy Finnigan sparked a storm this week by saying rapist footballer Ched Evans had not physically harmed the teenager he attacked. Her father, TV presenter Richard Madeley, warned the trolls that ‘prosecution awaits’ for making rape threats against her daughter after she stepped in to defend the controversial comments. Daughter and father: Chloe Madeley (left) and her father Richard Madeley (right) leave home in London today . And fitness instructor Miss Madeley told BBC Newsbeat today: ‘I always ignore the disgusting troll tweets I get because I honestly do not want to give them any attention. ‘But the tweet in question took it to another level and I wanted to stand up against it this time. ‘However, now that I've done that, I don't want to tempt vicious attention seekers with the rewards of media attention. So I won't be saying anything more.’ Finnigan this week inflamed a debate about whether Evans should return to his footballing career by claiming his crime was ‘non violent’ and did not cause ‘bodily harm’, during a TV panel discussion. Her comments on ITV's Loose Women caused a wave of criticism and also sparked threats against her daughter. Mr Madeley tweeted: ‘Trolls who sent sick rape threats? Prosecution awaits you.’ Chloe Madeley: 'As the daughter of journalists, I believe in free speech. I love the platform Twitter gives' Disgusted: Chloe (left with her mother Judy and right) has been called 'deformed' and 'half-man, half-horse' He added that he had noted every troll threat, and those who threatened rape on her were in ‘deep trouble’. Scotland Yard said they were not aware of any complaints made to police. Writing in the Daily Mail today, Miss Madeley revealed her mother had been upset and unsettled when she told her of the tweets. She added that the fact such threats can be issued to people on social media is ‘extremely chilling’ and ‘extremely cowardly’. Miss Madeley, who described herself as a huge fan of Twitter and a strong advocate for the right to free speech, said she felt violated by the threats and considered those behind the tweets to have crossed a line into criminality. ‘How can it be right for someone to issue a rape threat to a young women and think it acceptable?’ she wrote. She confirmed that her father will be reporting those who sent the tweets to the police. Finnigan apologised after the show, in which she also said the Sheffield United striker's 19-year-old victim had ‘far too much to drink’ prior to the ‘unpleasant’ attack in a hotel room. Family attack: One troll told Chloe (left, and right with her parents): 'Your mother gave some great advice on rape, probably as she has personal experience... Only joking Madeley, your mother was a willing participant' The presenter, who was making her debut on the show, said: ‘I apologise unreservedly for any offence that I may have caused as a result of the wording I used. ‘I absolutely wasn't suggesting that rape was anything other than an horrendous crime and, as I said on the programme, I was in no way attempting to minimise the terrible ordeal that any woman suffers as a result. ‘The point I was attempting to raise as part of the debate was what should happen to someone after they have committed a crime and served their time?’ Among those who criticised the TV presenter over her comments was Northumbria police and crime commissioner Vera Baird. Her father, 58-year-old Richard, said he had 'noted' every troll's threat to Chloe, adding: 'They're in deep trouble' Finnigan (right) appeared on Loose Women with (from left) Ruth Langsford, Jane Moore, and Coleen Nolan . ‘No bodily injury has little relevance, it doesn't have to do physical damage to be rape and it is the essence of violence to force himself upon her,’ she said. Regarding the victim being drunk, Mrs Baird added: ‘What has this got to do with this if he forced himself upon her? ‘If you get drunk and someone steals your wallet, does this mean it's any less of a theft than if you were sober? ‘He has to work somewhere but it probably shouldn't be in such a public role since it looks like he's being given a platform for approval.’ Evans is expected to be released from prison this week. Miss Madeley said she hopes the trolls who targeted her ‘will get their just deserts’.","Online bullies turned on Chloe Madeley after her mother's comments on TV .

"A former Qantas customer service worker has claimed the company ordered her to remove her crucifix necklace despite her Muslim colleagues being allowed to wear headscarfs. Georgina Sarikoudis, a Melbourne mother-of-two, said she was told to 'cut off' her prayer knot bracelets and remove her crucifix while working for the company in late 2013 and early 2014. Ms Sarikoudis, who attends a Greek Orthodox Church in the city's south-east, made the allegations about her treatment in a complaint to the Victorian Civil and Administration Tribunal (VCAT). Jewellery row: Georgina Sarikoudis, pictured in her Qantas uniform while wearing her crucifix . The crucifix in question: Ms Sarikoudis alleged she was told to remove her crucifix . 'The bullying was getting so intense and out of control, I thought: ""I've got to stop this. I'm going to VCAT""',' Ms Sarikoudis told Daily Mail Australia. She said the alleged dramas occurred after Qantas introduced a new uniform in December. The rules surrounding religious jewellery did not change, however the airline said employees were reminded of uniform rules and guidelines at the time. Ms Sarikoudis, who worked for the airline company for 19 years, was outraged that her Islamic colleagues were allowed to wear their headscarfs while she was allegedly unable to wear her crucifix. 'This is discrimination, it's just not acceptable,' Ms Sarikoudis said. 'How can you have a policy for one religion and not another in a country like Australia.' A Qantas spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia employees were allowed to wear religious jewellery, adding that the company provided employees with many options so they can continue to wear it. 'Our uniform standards don’t prohibit employees from wearing religious jewellery,' the spokeswoman said. 'Many of our employees wear such jewellery every day, it’s simply worn under their uniform.' 'We give our employees plenty of options so they can continue to wear religious jewellery that is in accordance with the requirement of their faith.' Controversy: Ms Sarikoudis worked for Qantas for 19 years before she took a voluntary redundancy in May . Qantas workers can wear headscarfs for religious, cultural or medical purposes only if they are French navy or black in colour. The Qantas spokeswoman said all employees were required to follow uniform codes and guidelines, as is with most airlines. According to the Herald Sun, Ms Sarikoudis is seeking an apology and a change in uniform policy from her former employer in her VCAT claim. VCAT is slated to hold a hearing into the matter in February next year.

"Olympian Steph Prem’scareer was cut short after a devastating fall in 2010 . A devastating fall saw Olympian Steph Prem’s snowboarding career cut short - but she has no regrets. Skiing on the slopes for a living was her everything until 2010 when one bad jump in the World Cup finals in Italy changed the Melbourne woman's life forever. Despite the entire left side of her body taking the brunt of the fall - complete with fractured vertebrae, compressed discs, a dislocated hip, five broken ribs, a torn pelvis and hamstring - Prem, who competed under her maiden name of Hickey, could only think about getting back up in the air. But four years on, the 29-year-old has accepted her fate of never being able to compete again and has gained an unexpected love of Pilates throughout her long and arduous road to recovery. On that day back in in April 2010, Prem had been taking it easy on the last jump because many female competitors had injured themselves. ‘My coach said to me “unless you’ve got the speed - don’t hit it” and I really thought I had it - I came into the last turn with a lot of speed and just before I came off the jump the take-off was incorrect and the minute I tried to correct myself I knew was in trouble,’ she said. Prem has spent four years doing hard core rehabilitation to no longer live in constant pain . She tried both traditional and alternative methods to help improve and strengthen her body . This was the first and last time Prem, who had been a professional snowboarder for eight years and had just competed in her first Olympics in Vancouver a few months earlier, would ever experience such a terrifying realisation. ‘When you’re in the air and you’ve got time to think about how much trouble you are in – you are in a lot of trouble,’ she said. Prem admits she could not be told by anyone that she would never compete again – she had to figure it out herself over time. She tried everything for her constant pain including Valium, spinal cortisone injections and nerve ending operations but nothing worked. Four years on, she still does corrective exercise and rehabilitation every week for her injuries . Prem said it took her a long time to accept she would never compete as a snowboarder again . After much trial and error, it was a combination of both traditional methods, such as rehabilitation and correctional exercise, along with alternative measures that has worked for her. ‘The last year and a half I have also tried Chinese medicine, detoxing and liver cleansers to try to rid my body of imflammation and pain,’ she said. She also has a strict diet and solid cleansing for her body - and swears by massage and acupuncture. ‘I had to try a lot of different things and be open-minded to a lot of different treatments because I was finding I was in a lot of pain for a long time and not a lot was helping.’ But it wasn’t until she tried Pilates three years ago - and was relieved to discover an exercise she could do without experiencing any pain - that her quality of life improved out of sight. ‘It completely changed my whole way of being because before the accident I was addicted to daily exercise as a professional athlete but I lost that with my injury,' she said. 'I had been so limited and restricted in what I could do that it was so awesome to discover Pilates because a lot of the work was protected using the machinery.' 'But also the lower deeper intrinsic work that I was doing gave me back that daily outlet and there was so much I could achieve,' she said. 'It gives you strength from the inside out – it helped me massively mentally and physically because I could do something again.' It wasn’t until she tried Pilates three years ago and was relieved to discover an exercise she could do without experiencing any pain that her quality of life improved out of sight . While still deep in her own rehabilitation, Prem decided to start up her own Pilates studio in Melbourne, Premium Performance . While still deep in her own rehabilitation, Prem decided to start up her own Pilates studio, Premium Performance, in Melbourne,  to help women of all ages to feel better about themselves. She is now feels so fulfilled by teaching Pilates that she doesn't miss being a professional sportswoman despite her competitive nature. But nothing could ever stop her from continuing to play on the ski slopes. 'I was thrilled to get back on the board two years ago - it came quite naturally like riding a bike but of course I have limitations since the accident - like hitting 60 foot jumps,' she said. 'My husband and I take people on ski holiday tours, and in February was the first time I could ski for a week straight without being in pain.' ‘2014 is the healthiest and most out of pain I have been in four years which is amazing but it was three solid years of a lot of hard work,' she said. ‘I still see a rehab specialist twice a week that’s the reality of the injury.' She is now feels so fulfilled by teaching Pilates that she doesn't miss being a professional sportswoman despite her competitive nature .

Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young (pictured) has written to the AFP to warn Mr Morrison's staff may have breached the Crimes Act .

"A Houston-area man was in critical condition after being shot in the face when he tried to take a loaded pistol away from a 3-year-old boy, police said on Monday. Patrick Sanders, 20, was sleeping on the couch when the gun slipped out of his pants on to the floor in the incident that took place on Saturday in a Houston apartment. The child then handled the gun and Sanders tried to grab it from the toddler, police said. Dangerous territory: Patrick Sanders, 20, was sleeping on the couch when the gun slipped out of his pants on to the floor and eventually made its way into the hands of a 3-year-old (not pictured) who shot him in the face . 'At that time, the gun went off and Sanders was shot in the face. The child was not injured,' Houston Police said in a statement. Neither the name of the child nor the child's relationship to the shooter have been disclosed. According the New Yorkers Against Gun Violence who gathered statistics from all over America, over 1,300 victims of unintentional shootings between 2005 to 2010 were under 25 years of age. A federal government study of unintentional shootings found that 8 per cent of accidental shooting deaths resulted in shots fired by children under the age of 6. Around 33 per cent of U.S. households contain a gun and half of them didn't lock up their guns. 40 per cent of those households are inhabited by kids under the age of 18. Even though Sanders was not shot to death, he was shot in the face and scarred for life if he survives. The U.S. General Accounting office has estimated that in order to lower the number of unintentional shooting deaths and injuries one should provide a child-proof safety lock and a loading indicator . The Mail Online called the Houston Police Department but no one was able to comment on whether any charges were filed.","Patrick Sanders, 20, was sleeping on the couch when the gun slipped out of his pants on to the floor in the incident that took place on Saturday .

"An electrician called to Marcus Volke's home on the night he murdered and cooked up transgender wife was told by the 28-year-old he was cooking up pig's broth. Brisbane tradesman Brad Coyne was the on-call electrician who came to Volke's aid when he called to have his stove fixed on Saturday night at his Teneriffe home in Brisbane's inner city.

"Meet Craig 'frog' Falconer - the man who recently sold his soul. The New Zealand hotel manager auctioned it for NZD$51, which equates to about AUD$46, on an auction website.

"Sam Allardyce has escaped the West Ham axe after agreeing to produce a more adventurous team true to the attacking principles of the club. Under-pressure Allardyce was summoned to a meeting with the board yesterday and emerged with his job after accepting certain objectives, including a change of philosophy and a top-10 finish. The 59-year-old will have a budget of £20million for signings — although the board will become more actively involved in the scouting and recruitment process. Scroll down for the full West Ham statement . Staying put: Many had expected Allardyce to be sacked after a disappointing season . Stand by your man: West Ham owners David Gold (left) and David Sullivan (right) met with Sam Allardyce on Tuesday along with vice-chairman Karren Brady (centre) He has agreed to add to his staff an . ‘attacking coach’, someone who will have responsibilities for creating a . more cavalier and entertaining side, and will also be expected to . develop more youngsters from the West Ham academy. Despite . fierce opposition from supporters, joint-chairmen David Sullivan and . David Gold have stayed loyal to Allardyce, who they appointed three . years ago and who has a year left on his contract. In . a poll of more than 12,000 West Ham fans this month, less than a . quarter said they  wanted to keep the manager who led them back to the . Barclays Premier League in his first season and has kept the club up . ever since, finishing 13th last season. There were protests at Upton Park last season against the direct style of play and Allardyce was even booed in victory. In . a statement, the  co-owners stressed they had not ignored the feelings . of supporters. ‘We have a very clear vision of how we want West Ham . United to operate under our joint  ownership,’ said Sullivan and Gold. ‘Although not everybody understands the West Ham Way, we do and we . respect it as we have been supporters all our lives. ‘We believe this is about a philosophy that is not just about the style of play, but the whole ethos that surrounds the club. ‘Sam . was asked to give us a detailed presentation on his vision for next . season and during this he assured us he can deliver that ethos to West . Ham United and we have agreed to support him with the resources that he . needs. ‘We have mapped out a way forward with him that will ensure our much-deserving fans have more to cheer about next season. ‘We . should also stress, though, that while improvements do need to be made, . Sam deserves credit for the job he has done thus far after securing . promotion in his first year and two respectable Premier League finishes . in the two years thereafter.’ Rare win: Andy Carroll (right) and James Tomkins celebrate as West Ham beat Tottenham . Shining light: Mark Noble was one of few players to emerge from the season with his head held high . Allardyce . was also applauded in the statement for his work with Mark Noble, James . Tomkins and Winston Reid and the team’s defensive solidity. It is his expertise at avoiding  relegation which is his greatest asset to the club. Allardyce’s . record is so good that his presence virtually guarantees  survival. At . least it does if he is allowed to play his way. Whether his teams can be equally resilient while playing more expansive and attractive football remains to  be seen. A . similar clash of ideologies was at the heart of Stoke’s decision to . part company with Tony Pulis. Stoke  finished ninth, but Pulis won LMA . Manager of the Year for rescuing  Crystal Palace from the drop. Sullivan . and Gold have clearly wavered over this decision and put out feelers on . potential successors but the decisive factor seems to have been that . they were unsure about securing a more reliable option than Allardyce at . this moment. West Ham United can confirm that manager Sam Allardyce will lead the club into the 2014-15 Barclays Premier League season after constructive talks with the club's board. The board and Allardyce have held lengthy and detailed discussions on the club's direction, values and philosophy and a positive way forward for next season has been agreed. After listening to feedback from supporters, the board have insisted on improvements to the set-up of the playing and backroom staff to ensure the team provides more entertainment next season. The manager has agreed to recruit a new attacking coach to complement the existing coaching set-up as well as an overhaul of the club's scouting and recruitment operation that will see the board have a greater involvement in the players who are signed, as the board will once again be investing considerable funds into the club this summer. The club have made clear that they want to see progression on the pitch and at least a top-10 finish as a result. West Ham United joint-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold said: 'We have a very clear vision of how we want West Ham United to operate under our joint ownership. Although not everybody understands the West Ham Way, we do and we respect it as we have been supporters all our lives. We believe this is about a philosophy that is not just about the style of play, but the whole ethos that surrounds the club. 'Sam was asked to give us a detailed presentation on his vision for next season and during this he assured us that he can deliver that ethos to West Ham United and we have agreed to support him with the resources that he needs. We have mapped out a way forward with him that will ensure our much-deserving fans have more to cheer about next season. 'We should also stress, though, that while improvements do need to be made, Sam deserves credit for the job he has done thus far after securing promotion in his first year and two respectable Premier League finishes in the two years thereafter. 'We have also seen the likes of Mark Noble, James Tomkins and Winston Reid all make huge progress under his management, which in turn contributed to our impressive record of 14 clean sheets last season. 'The truly historic opportunity of a move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016 forms a major part of our five-year strategy to take this club forward and, while we have a duty to make sure we stay in the Premier League, we also want to make sure the performances on the pitch will befit a team playing in such a world-renowned stadium. 'We are absolutely committed to taking West Ham United to new heights and we want to see the Club continue on an upward trajectory next season. The 2014-15 campaign is crucial to our future and we are confident that Sam has the passion, experience and determination to make sure it is a success.' West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce said: 'I look forward to taking the club forward and improving the squad for next season to try and achieve the plans we have set out in our very productive meeting last week.' West Ham leave . Upton Park for the Olympic Stadium in 2016 and it is  central to the . strategy to have the club in the Premier League. ‘We . also want to make sure the performances on the pitch will befit a team . playing in such a world-renowned stadium,’ added the co-owners. ‘We are . absolutely committed to taking West Ham United to new heights and we . want to see the club continue on an upward trajectory next season. ‘The . 2014-15 campaign is crucial to our future and we are confident that Sam . has the passion, experience and determination to make sure it is a . success.’ For Allardyce, it . is a muted victory. He remains at the helm, with his existing backroom . team intact — even if he has been chastened and his powers reduced — and . has the opportunity  to prove what he believes: that his methods are . adaptable and capable of producing attractive football at an elite . level. ‘I look forward to . taking the club  forward and improving the squad for next season to try . to achieve the plans set out in our very productive meeting last week,’ said the West Ham manager.","Sam Allardyce will not be sacked by West Ham after meeting with board .

"Some of the world’s largest firms including top British companies are using a Luxembourg tax avoidance scheme ‘like a magical fairyland’ to get out of paying billions of pounds, it emerged last night. Leaked tax papers totalling nearly 28,000 pages connected to more than 1,000 firms show businesses used a long-winded process involving internal loans and interest payments to cut their tax bills, The Guardian reported. The arrangements – used by top companies including vacuum cleaner company Dyson and drugs group Shire – were signed off by the European Union state and are all legal. Scheme: Some of the world’s largest firms including top British companies like Dyson are using a Luxembourg tax avoidance scheme ‘like a magical fairyland’ to get out of paying billions of pounds . But the revelations are predicted to trigger more calls for politicians to work harder to stop firms taking advantage of international tax rules avoid their tax bills. The Guardian reported last night that Dyson had set up companies in the Isle of Man and Luxembourg to put £300m of internal loans into its UK operations in 2011. The interest payments made on the loans were taxed at only around one per cent in Luxembourg – saving the firm millions. The newspaper also said drugs firm Shire and city trading company Icap had also cut their tax bills with help from Luxembourg. The Guardian said the leaked papers showed ‘Luxembourg was acting as a go-between, both enabling and masking tax avoidance, which always takes place beyond its borders’. President: The new president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured) - a former Luxembourg prime minister - has insisted the country is not a tax haven . Stephen Shay, a Harvard Law School professor who has held senior tax roles in the US Treasury, said: ‘Clearly the database is evidencing a pervasive enabling by Luxembourg of multinationals’ avoidance of taxes [around the world].’ He described Luxembourg as being ‘like a magical fairyland.’ It comes as only last week Prime Minister David Cameron told business leaders he would not tolerate large multinational firms avoiding tax. Cracking down: Last week Prime Minister David Cameron told business leaders he would not tolerate large multinational firms avoiding tax . Mr Cameron said: ‘We’ve cut the rate of corporation tax down to 20 per cent, we’re the most competitive place to come and start a business, but here’s the deal – if they have a low tax rate, those companies have damn well got to pay it.’ And George Osborne is next month expected to announce new measures to stop such businesses diverting its money offshore. The new president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker – a former Luxembourg prime minister – this summer pledged to ‘try to put some morality, some ethics, into the European tax landscape’. He has also insisted the country was not a tax haven, The Guardian reported. The newspaper said the findings were put to Shire, Icap and Dyson but all three declined to answer questions and instead issued statements saying they do not engage in tax avoidance and they pay tax in the countries where profits are made. It was also reported last night that a joint venture between the Guardian Media Group and private equity group Apax Partners in 2008 also used a Luxembourg structure when it invested in magazine and events group Emap, now Top Right. A spokesman for GMG said: 'We partnered with a private equity company which regularly used such structures. A Luxembourg entity was used because Apax already had that structure in place. The fact that the parent company is a Luxembourg company does not give rise to any UK corporation tax savings for GMG.' Executives including Justin King, the former chief executive of Sainsbury’s, have appeared to defend the multinationals. Mr King, who left the supermarket giant in July, said the situation was ‘not black and white’ and that, if people did not like the tax methods used by a particular firm, they should shop elsewhere. He said: ‘They are not loopholes. They are legitimate tax systems put in place by legitimate governments legitimately elected. Taxing question: Last month, it emerged that Facebook had not paid any corporation tax in the UK for a second year in a row, despite recording sales of £50million . ‘It is wrong to lay that at the door of companies operating their business in a structure… constructed by government. ‘The first thing you have got to do is hold governments to account for putting those structures in place; that we have seen in Ireland. ‘The Irish have come to the conclusion that the “double Irish” is not acceptable in their own parliament.’ Last month, it emerged that Facebook had not paid any corporation tax in the UK for a second year in a row, despite recording sales of £50million, after pushing much of its revenues through a complex scheme in Ireland.","Papers show firms used internal loans and interest payments to cut tax bills .

"The United States may deploy ground troops to fight ISIS in order to prevent the terror group from capturing the Iraqi capital Baghdad. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey he does not envisage the use of large numbers of combat troops in Iraq, in the operation which has now been named 'Inherent Resolve'. This comes as ISIS has moved through the Anbar Province and is threatening the outskirts of Baghdad. Scroll down for video . General Martin Dempsey, right, said he would be willing to recommend the deployment of US ground troops to President Obama if necessary in a bid to counter the 'threat to national security' posed by ISIS . General Dempsey, pictured, claimed that Operation Inherent Resolve would prevent Baghdad from falling . The US led coalition has been pounding suspected ISIS strongholds near the Turkish border with Syria . General Dempsey told CNN that it was unlikely that ISIS could seize control of the Iraqi capital. He said: 'I'm confident we can assist the Iraqis to keep Baghdad from falling.' General Dempsey argued that the Iraqi army required more training after it emerged, some of them fled when approached by ISIS. He described Iraqi defences around the captial as 'fairly formidable'. The United States currently has 12 teams of military advisers in the country. He claimed that 'war is discovery' and admitted he may recommend the use of US ground troops to President Barack Obama if the situation necessitates it. General Dempsey told CNN that the US has received 'significant commitment' from other members of the international community. He admitted that US led airstrikes alone will not defeat ISIS, whom he described as a 'national security threat'. He said that the anti-ISIS mission has now been named 'Inherent Resolve'. It is not just US aircraft involved in the strikes, this Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18F Super Hornet is patrolling Iraqi airspace searching for ISIS ground targets to engage and destroy as part of Operation Inherent Resolve . He said: '""Inherent Resolve"" is intended to reflect the unwavering resolve and deep commitment of the U.S. and partner nations in the region and around the globe to eliminate the terrorist group ISIL and the threat they pose to Iraq, the region and the wider international community,' He admitted that the Iraqi government itself is partly responsible for the growth of ISIS and said that much of the effort in training local security forces has been wasted. He said: 'The coaching, and teaching, and mentoring, the thousands of interactions at the local level were all wasted by the government of Iraq that chose deliberately to follow a sectarian agenda and alienate entire segments of the population, which created an environment in which ISIL could return and could flourish.' General Dempsey said he had been surprised by the poor state of the Iraqi army. He added: 'I think what we all probably missed was the degree to which the Iraqi armed forces had eroded and wouldn't stand and face ISIL. I think we all missed that.' OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE . The codename given to the latest Middle East campaign launched by the United States targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Inherent Resolve features a limited air campaign across Iraq and Syria to degrade the fighting capacity of ISIS. At present there are no acknowledged US troops on the ground . OPERATION DESERT SHIELD . President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Desert Shield was designed to prevent Iraq from threatening Saudi Arabia, while allowing time for a massive buildup of troops in the Middle East. OPERATION DESERT STORM . When the decision was made to remove Iraq from Kuwait, the international coalition, led by the United States launched Desert Storm in early 1991. OPERATION DESERT FOX . Launched in December 1998, Operation Desert Fox was a brief air campaign against Saddam Hussein's weapons installations after the dictator refused to allow UN inspectors to view the  sites. OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM . US forces begin a bombing campaign in Afghanistan in October 2001 following the 9/11 terror attacks. The initial bombing campaign escalated into an operation which involved at its height 140,000 US and coalition troops on the ground. In June 2013, Afghan security forces took over combat operations on the ground although US support troops are scheduled to remain in the country past the December 2014 deadline for withdrawal. OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM . In March 2003 President George W Bush decided to topple Saddam Hussein with an overwhelming air and ground campaign. Despite routing the Iraqi army and removing the dictator, the resulting power vacuum was responsible for the ongoing civil war in Iraq.","General Martin Dempsey said the US is considering ground troops in  Iraq .

"Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Dessalegn, has rejected accusations that his government tortures its own people . More than £1billion from taxpayers was given in aid to Ethiopia while its security forces tortured, killed and raped, campaigners claimed yesterday. Amnesty International has documented thousands of shockingly brutal abuses against citizens suspected of political opposition. The human rights group’s report follows calls for greater scrutiny by Britain and other donors to ensure their money does not support state-sanctioned killings and brutality. Amnesty warned that thousands have faced repeated torture while unlawful state killings have been carried out in a ‘relentless crackdown on real or imagined dissent’. Horrors inflicted on ordinary Ethiopians include women being gang-raped and tortured by prison guards. Amnesty’s report also tells how a teacher was stabbed in the eye with a bayonet after refusing to teach pro-government propaganda to his students. Entire families were arrested with parents and siblings ‘disappearing’ after they were taken to army camps, said Amnesty. Britain has donated more than £1billion to Ethiopia in the last five years alone. The Government has denied funding security forces in the autocratic one-party state. But Britain’s relationship with the East African country is likely to come under scrutiny in a judicial review into claims made by a Ethiopian farmer. He has been given legal aid in this country to pursue allegations that UK aid supported the regime while it forced thousands of villagers like him from their land using murder, torture and rape. Ethiopia remains one of the world’s poorest countries following decades of drought and famine, suffering highlighted by the 1984 Band Aid fundraising appeal. The West has been accused of turning a blind eye to human rights abuse and effectively propping up the regime because of its support for the so-called war on terror. Ethiopia has given support to combat radical groups such as Al Qaeda in the Horn of Africa and Al Shabaab in neighbouring Somalia. Last year, an independent analysis accused countries giving aid of not stopping the hardline Addis Ababa regime from abusing its citizens. It said donors had ‘failed to take decisive action to prevent policies that deny the basic human rights of some of the poorest and most marginalised people of Ethiopia’. The US report went on: ‘Donor organisations have failed to hold the Ethiopian government to standards of human and political rights, a neglect principally illustrated by the accounts of the forced relocations of entire communities in the name of development. It should be no surprise that unchecked assistance to a hegemonic political party gets diverted to efforts to maintain political control,’ it added. International Development Secretary Justine Greening is under pressure to investigate allegations that major recipients of British aid are guilty of torture state-sanctioned murder . The Oakland Institute, of California, added that the Department for International Development was the third biggest donor to the country after the US and the World Bank. Questions have been raised over the value of some of the projects funded by the DfID in Ethiopia. Last year, the Daily Mail told how £4million of taxpayers’ money paid for an Ethiopian version of the Spice Girls to spread a message of empowerment to women. The DfID denies that aid money is used to force people from their homes or to fund security forces. A spokesman said Britain gave £261.5million to Ethiopia last year. This was used to provide clean drinking water for more than 250,000 people, send 1.6million children to primary school and ensure 110,000 mothers gave birth safely. ‘Not a penny goes to Ethiopia’s police or security sector,’ he said. ‘We work with independent agencies like Unicef to make the security and justice sector fairer and more accountable, eg helping women and girls get better access to justice. ‘The UK provides targeted funding for health, education and sanitation, not to the central Ethiopian treasury. We have robust legal and accounting checks to ensure UK aid is spent where it is intended. ‘We regularly raise human rights with the relevant authorities, including at the highest level of the government.’ A spokesman for the regime ‘categorically denied’ Amnesty International’s claims. Redwan Hussein also accused the campaigners of being ‘hellbent on tarnishing Ethiopia’s image again and again’. Harrowing accounts of rape and brutality were highlighted by Amnesty International. In one case, three teenage girls arrested with their parents were tortured with hot coals by soldiers at a military camp where they were held for years. One sister, named only as Nooria, said the soldiers came to her family’s home when she was 14 or 15, after her father was arrested on suspicion of political dissent. She said she was interrogated and beaten, and still carried horrific physical scars from when she and her sisters were burned. ‘Two soldiers did this to me. They came into the room, tied up our hands and made us lie down on our backs. They put hot coals on my stomach. They didn’t just burn me; they also burned my two sisters. ‘Our clothes melted on us. We screamed but the soldiers didn’t care, they’re accustomed to screaming.’ Nooria was later released with one of her sisters but has not seen her parents or eldest sister since. Other detainees told the campaigners how molten plastic was poured onto their legs. There were also shocking accounts of captors cutting off the ears and fingers of prisoners. A 33-year-old woman told Amnesty she was detained without charge for nine months in a military camp. ‘I was thoroughly beaten,’ she said. ‘I cried for help saying that I was not guilty and should not be killed. ‘One night, three men came to my cell and said that I was being taken for interrogating but they just took me to a room and raped me. ‘After that, they just threw me back into the cell. I was not the only one –they would do the same to the other women there.’ A second woman said: ‘I was raped by three men – one after the other. I remember them very clearly and can identify them. Rape happened several times. This was not unique to me, the other women in the cell had the same experience.’ A midwife said he was beaten and punished after delivering the baby of the wife of a member of the banned Oromo Liberation Front. A university student told how he was arrested at gunpoint after winning a competition to produce a business plan because security forces said it was political. The student was beaten, starved and endured months of interrogation, including a mock execution.","Amnesty International says 5,000 people tortured, raped and 'disappeared'

"Luke Shaw is in hysterics, patting the knee of his Southampton and England team-mate Rickie Lambert when the talk turns to beetroot. ‘It’s crazy. I didn’t even realise until recently he worked at a beetroot factory,’ said Shaw. ‘It shows how far he has come; I am so proud of what he has achieved.’ Everything is new to Shaw, the 18-year-old left back who has been catapulted into a World Cup. It seems crazy to think that his first World Cup memory is from 2006 when England were beaten by Portugal in the quarter-finals. Scary stuff. VIDEO Luke Shaw: World Cup call-up was the best feeling in the world . Young Lion: England left back Luke Shaw's first World Cup memory is from the tournament in 2006 . Pals: Shaw is proud of his Southampton and England team-mate Rickie Lambert (pictured) To travel . to Brazil ahead of Ashley Cole, the former Chelsea left back who played . 107 times for his country, is something quite extraordinary. Back . in March, when he made his England debut against Denmark as a . second-half substitute for Ashley Cole, he was still living in digs in . Southampton. He doesn’t even drive. ‘I . was in digs for three or four years and they were like a second family . to me but I recently moved out and am going to get my own flat,’ he . added. ‘When I got my first England call, I was still in digs in the same place as one of the Under 18s. ‘It . is something I did for three or four years and I loved it. I didn’t . feel I needed to move out soon because it was like another home for me. ‘I . don’t drive but one of the young lads drives to training, Tom Leggett . (who has just joined Aston Villa). After the World Cup I am going to do . that intensive course to learn to drive in one week.’ Second home: Shaw was still living in digs when he was first called up to the England squad . This . has been an incredible journey, and Shaw was still taking it all in as . he sat alongside his Southampton team-mate Lambert this week. Making way: Shaw is going to the World Cup in front of Ashley Cole . He . only realised he’d make the squad when Cole confirmed his international . retirement on Twitter on the final day of the Barclays Premier League . season on May 11. ‘My . family were crying,’ he explained. ‘But it was the best feeling in the . world. I didn’t think I was 100 per cent going. I waited until the next . day to see the squad announced. ‘It . was something I had dreamed of, to represent my country at a World Cup. A few years ago I was sat watching Ashley Cole (for England) on TV; I . wouldn’t say I have taken his place but I have gone to the World Cup in . front of him. ‘When . I look back, it is unbelievable how far I have come. I have had two . years playing in the Premier League, now I am going to represent my . country at the World Cup. At times he nervously bites on his nails or chomps on some chewing gum as he spoke about his rapid progress at Southampton. His move to Manchester United is on hold, but he knows there are some big decisions to make when he returns from the World Cup. ‘That doesn’t bother me one bit, I am here to play for England and that is all I am focusing on.’ During . England’s open training session this week, he was one of three players . (with Raheem  Sterling and Ross Barkley) pulled to one side by head . coach Roy Hodgson as they walked off the pitch. ‘He . just talked about the season, he has been to a lot of Southampton . games. It was a very tough decision between me and Ashley but it was . about form and the best players  at this point. He said I’ve had a . fantastic season; that is why I am here.’ Shaw thing: Eng;land boss Roy Hodgson gives instructions to the Southampton defender during training . It . seems incredible to think he was released by Chelsea when he was eight, . the team he supported as a boy after being brought up close to their . Cobham training ground in West Molesey. ‘I was let go because of my height,’ he added. ‘I think it was only when I was about 14 or 15 I got bigger. ‘I . can’t remember much about being released but after my first day on . trial at Southampton, I got a phone call straight away to tell me they . wanted to take me on.’ He has graduated through Southampton’s academy, rising through the development teams to become the first-choice left back. Deserved: Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana is going to the World Cup after a fine season for the Saints . This . week Southampton fired Under 18 coaches Jason Dodd and Paul Williams, . part of executive director Les Reed’s battle for more control. Shaw is . fiercely protective. ‘I . sent them a text straight away to thank them for everything,’ he added. ‘They meant a lot to me and helped me a lot with my development. I was . with them from 15 to 17. They helped me massively; when I saw the news I . was very upset.’ The . talent factory at St Mary’s includes Shaw, James Ward-Prowse, Calum . Chambers, Sam Gallagher and Harry Reed, all first-team  professionals at . Saints. ‘I . don’t know if it is any different to other clubs but the way we get . brought up is very good,’ he added. ‘We are all meant to be grounded. At . other clubs there might be players who receive a professional contract . and think they have made it. ‘If . someone goes over the limit and starts acting big time, I’m sure they . will be brought down a peg. They’ll be straight in a room with the boss . and have a meeting to say this is not the Southampton way.’","Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert all called up to England squad for this summer's World Cup .

"To understand why Kobane is doomed, you only have to stand on a nearby hillside and watch as the Islamic State maniacs tighten their grip. A few hundred yards away, the besieged town was in flames again yesterday as the jihadis fired mortar bombs into densely-packed neighbourhoods. Every explosive thud and pillar of smoke signifies yet more deaths, as the men, women and children of the stricken Syrian frontier town desperately fight to the last. It is a deeply uneasy feeling to witness this life-and-death struggle against a terrorist state while standing in Turkey, a country that regards itself as European. Scroll down for video . A group of Kurdish refugees watch as US-led coalition airstrikes hit their former home city of Kobane . A Turkish army vehicle positions itself in between those watching the fight for Kobane and the battle which rages in the distance . Smoke emanates from a building hit by U.S. airstrikes, which rained down consistently today in between militants' mortar strikes . Photographer Jamie Wiseman and I watched as American warplanes dropped bombs on Islamic State positions in the east of Kobane, only for the terrorists to pop up elsewhere and launch another volley of mortars into civilian areas. Their menacing black flag has fluttered from at least two roof-tops for several days. Nato ground forces are but half a mile away. Ranged on the hills overlooking Kobane are rows of Turkish army tanks bristling with fire-power. At first glance, it looks as if this means the cavalry has arrived, ready to sweep into Kobane and offer protection at last to the wretched townsfolk. Surely, you think, it is possible for them to drive just a few hundred yards further, into Syria, and start to disperse the Islamic State fanatics into retreat? But the facts are very different. Although Turkey, with the second largest army in Nato and keen to join the EU, has pledged ‘to do everything’ it can to prevent a massacre unfolding on Europe’s doorstep, in truth, it seems to suit the country’s rulers not to send in their tanks. For, unlike every other Western government, Turkey - with its historic problems with the Kurdish minority - perversely considers Islamic State to be ‘an opportunity not a threat’. Despite there being more than 30 airstrikes on Kobane (pictured) since Monday, Kurdish civilians remained trapped inside the city . At the border itself, rather than helping the Syrian Kurds in Kobane, the Turkish military is effectively contributing to the stranglehold by blocking reinforcements that the town so urgently needs. Meanwhile, thousands of Kurds from across Turkey have descended on the border region in the past fortnight to support their Syrian kin. They want to go across and fight, and their sense of betrayal is palpable as the tragedy of Kobane unfolds before their eyes on the other side of a wire fence. Around mid-morning yesterday, a Turkish armoured vehicle zoomed across the desert, spreading clouds of dust. A gunner sitting on top started shouting at the Kurds, ordering them to retreat because Islamic State militants were shelling the nearby border crossing. One man refused to leave, coughing on the dust and yelling back: ‘We will stay here. Our friends and cousins and children are there. We will not move. We don’t believe you. We want to fight IS, even if it is just with stones.’ Crowds of Kurdish refugees and Turkish residents flocked to the border with Syria today to watch the battle unfold in the distance . Pictured left, smoke from a U.S. airstrike billows into the air, and right groups of refugees watch the bombing . The aerial bombardment on Kobane continued throughout the day while Kurds on the Turkish side of the border could only watch on as they kin were killed in the clashes with ISIS militants . Witnesses watched on as the jihadists released mortars into civilian areas of the city during breaks between U.S. bombings (pictured) Yasar Igten, 42, a telecoms worker from Istanbul explained the impasse. ‘Those tanks are not here to help us. They will wait and watch, until all the Kurds have been killed by ISIS. They hate the Kurds.’ His view was echoed by Ergin Demurlapu, 40, who said: ‘We are so angry with the Turkish government because they are helping ISIS with money and weapons. Those tanks could help us, but they don’t.’ Others, though, are just glad to be out of the battle-zone. Buzan, 35, a labourer who fled Kobane to Turkey five days ago with his family, is devastated as he stands beneath an olive tree and watches plumes of black smoke rise over his home town. His four children – twins aged three, a four-year-old girl and a five-year-old boy – cling to his leg. They are silent and just stare. The black flag of ISIS is raised on a building situated at the top of the town . He says they just ‘ran for our lives’, leaving behind his uncle who was beheaded. He says his children are terrified and did not sleep for days. ‘I built our house, but ISIS have destroyed it. We are lucky to be alive.’ Inside Kobane, under siege for nearly a month, the hideous struggle goes on to prevent it from becoming another ISIS stronghold. Men, women and children as young as ten bearing AK-47s are all that stand in the way of the butchering jihadis. Images of gun-toting grandmothers, teenage girls in jeans and primary school-age boys, all vowing to fight to the last, have been tweeted around the world. Some elderly people have refused to leave their homes, preferring to die there rather than be refugees in a foreign land. One desperate woman, Arin Mirkan, even turned herself into a suicide bomber to kill a group of ISIS fighters. It must be said that five days of US-led bombing raids have had some successes, pushing the extremists back to the edges of the town, which was about to fall a week ago. The low whirr of Tornado fighter aircraft can also be heard in the skies before they drop their bombs. We saw two bombs land yesterday, appearing to strike a hospital used by ISIS as a base in the east of the town, in which they already have a foothold. But almost simultaneously, word spread that ISIS had captured the town’s prison, enabling them to release inmates to help join their cause. ISIS has been able to use high-grade military kit that once belonged to the Americans and were looted from the Iraqi army. They include night-vision googles, meaning they can ambush the unsuspecting civilians of Kobane in the dead of night. Already at least seven people have been beheaded, with subsequent gruesome displays made of their heads. Those who escaped watch helplessly from the hillside overlooking the town. ‘We all have family and friends in there, but no one knows if they are still alive,’ said 38-year-old Ekrem Nassan. ‘We cannot contact them and are very worried about whether they have access to food and water.’ If ISIS succeeds in taking Kobane, the terror group will have seized an unbroken 125-mile stretch of border with Turkey. The town will be subjected to a brutal regime in which anyone disobeying rules will have their head cut off or be crucified. As the Turkish army is accused of standing idly by as atrocities are committed just yards away, parallels have been drawn with the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia during the Balkans War in 1995, when 8,000 people were massacred. Despite the U.S. air-strikes, the Kurds feel very vulnerable - confronting hostility a range of enemies with different historical reasons for seeking to kill them, control them, or rejoice that somebody else – even Islamic State – might do the dirty work for them. Mamoudi Ahmad, 45, a Turkish Kurd, said yesterday: ‘Everyone hates the Kurds. The Turks hate us and will never save us. Meanwhile, [Syrian dictator] Bashar al-Assad would be happy to see us crushed. And Islamic State wants to turn Kobane into a medieval caliphate. We don’t have many friends.’ So while Turkey ought to be Nato’s first line of defence against the fundamentalists - and it must be said that most Turks are appalled at the savagery of ISIS, the terror group’s activities may not be entirely unwelcome to the government which fears encouraging the Kurdish separatist movement inside its own borders. The crisis has seen explosive clashes in more than 20 cities as Kurds protested against the government’s aloof stance towards the stricken Syrian Kurds in Kobane. More than 30 people have died including ten yesterday when gunmen opened fire on police in eastern Turkey. Fighting in the small border city has raged for three weeks now in the face of determined jihadist advances . The airstrikes in Kobane (pictured) have not stopped ISIS forces from invading the city but have helped delay their advance . It's feared there could be a massacre of civilians if ISIS takes the city of Kobane (pictured), with thousands believed to be trapped either nearby or within the town . Six provinces in south-east Turkey have been placed under night-time curfew. Police have been meet the protesters with tear gas, sticks and water cannon, while angry Kurds have hurled stones and Molotov cocktails. For the Kurds, the siege of Kobane has become a rallying cause likened to the infamous atrocity in Iraq in 1998 when the then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein poisoned 5,000 Kurds at Halabja. Diplomats believe Erdogan is cynically exploiting the IS threat to extract concessions from both the Americans and the Kurds. He is demanding a buffer zone inside Syria, policed by Turkey, and a commitment by Washington to overthrow Assad. Writing in Middle East journal al-Monitor, author Amberin Zaman claimed this week: ‘Erdogan and his disciples view Kobane as an opportunity rather than a threat.’ Whatever the outcome of these international power games, time is running out for the benighted people of Kobane. Caught in crossfire - both diplomatic and deadly real - all they can do is fight, pray and hope.","EXCLUSIVE report and photographs by Sam Greenhill and Jamie Wiseman on the border near Kobane .

"A six-year-old transgender girl has won the right to use the girls restroom at her school in Colorado. The decision was made by the Colorado Civil Rights Division on Sunday that the Fountain-Fort Carson School District created an unnecessarily hostile situation for Coy Mathis by not allowing her to use the female bathroom. Transgender advocates are hailing the decision as a major step forward for transgender rights. By not allowing Coy to use the girls' restroom, the Eagleside Elementary School in Fountain 'creates an environment rife with harassment,' Steven Chavez, the division director, wrote in the decision. Winner: The Colorado Civil Rights Division has ruled in favor of six-year-old Coy Mathis, whose school had barred her from using the girls bathroom at her elementary school because she is transgender . Push: A psychologist confirmed that Coy was transgender and her passport lists her as female . The Denver Post reported that the New York-based Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund will be holding a news conference Monday to explain the decision affecting Coy Mathis. Coy Mathis, who was born male but has identified as female since the age of four, was barred from using the girls' restroom at Eagleside Elementary School in Fountain, Colorado in December. Mathis' parents, Kathryn and Jeremy Mathis, filed a complaint through the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund in February. Prior to the complaint, the . first-grader, who dresses as a girl and is recognized as female on her . passport and state-issued ID, had experienced no issue using the girls . bathrooms. Back to school: Coy Mathis, 6,  pictured with her brother, will be returning to school now that the civil rights case has been ruled in her favor . 'She would use the girls restrooms, . she would be called a girl, she would go in the girls lines,' Mrs . Mathis told Katie Couric in an episode of Katie dedicated to the issue. But a year after making the transition at school, the . Fountain-Fort Carson School District informed Coy's parents that she . would be barred from using the girl's restrooms after the winter break. Explaining the chain of events, Mr Mathis said: 'We got a call one evening, it was the principal and . he said he wanted to set up a meeting with us to discuss options for . Coy's future use of the restroom. Trapped inside the wrong body: Coy Mathis made the transition from boy to girl aged four . Uncomfortable: Coy's parents said before she made the transition from boy to girl she refused to go outside and play with her friends because she didn't want to wear boys' clothing . 'It came out that Coy was no longer . going to be able to use the girl's restroom and they were going to . require her to be using the boy's room or the staff bathroom or the . bathroom for the sick children. 'We didn't know why... we had no idea where this was coming from.' After receiving the news, the couple, who have five children under eight, took all of their children out of Eagleside Elementary School and filed a complaint with the state's civil rights division. But W Kelly Dude, the lawyer for Fountain-Fort Carson School District 8, told CNN that the school 'took into account not only Coy but . other students in the building, their parents, and the future impact a . boy with male genitals using a girls' bathroom would have as Coy grew . older... Fighting for her rights: Coy, left, plays with her sister Auri, two, at home in Fountain, Colorado . Early signs: Kathryn and Jeremy Mathis started to realize that their son was drawn towards 'everything girl' when he was just 18-months old . 'I'm certain you can appreciate that as Coy grows older and his . male genitals develop along with the rest of his body, at least some . parents and students are likely to become uncomfortable with his . continued use of the girls' restroom,' he added. The Mathis' case was the first to . challenge restrictions on a transgender person’s bathroom use under . Colorado’s anti-discrimination laws. Mrs Mathis said that Coy was just 18-months-old when she started being drawn towards 'everything girl'. Herself: Coy's parents said she seemed 'uncomfortable being a boy' Some of her favorite items included a fairy flower dress with a matching tutu and a Dora the Explorer bathing suit. 'It was starting to be obvious to us that Coy was really uncomfortable being a boy,' Mrs Mathis recalled. 'He wanted to know when we were going . to take him to the doctor so that they would give him girl parts so . that his body would be a girl.' It reached breaking-point when Coy refused to leave the house because she didn't want to change into boys' clothes. Happy family: Coy Mathis (right, with pink hair), her parents Kathryn and Jeremy, and her siblings, are celebrating their win in the Colorado Civil Rights Division court . All smiles: When Coy, middle, was just 18-months-old, some of her favorite items were more feminine, including a fairy flower dress with a matching tutu and a Dora the Explorer bathing suit . A psychologist confirmed that Coy was . transgender and when she was four years old her parents let her 'be who . she was' and she made the transition from boy to girl. 'This ruling sends a loud and clear message that transgender students may not be targeted for discrimination and that they must be treated equally in school,' said the Fund's executive director Michael Silverman. 'It is a victory for Coy and a triumph for fairness.' Coy was being home-school pending the legal decision. 'Schools should not discriminate against their students, and we are thrilled that Coy can return to school and put this behind her,' Kathryn Mathis, Coy's mother, said in a statement. 'All we ever wanted was for Coy's school to treat her the same as other little girls. We are extremely happy that she now will be treated equally.'","A Colorado transgender girl, Coy Mathis, 6,  has won the right to use the female restrooms at her elementary school in a civil rights case .

"Dr Sally Norton says many obese people survive on a diet of pizza, fries, crisps, cakes and biscuits which leaves them obese - but undernourished . The number of people who are malnourished despite being obese is scandalous, a leading weight loss surgeon has said today. A recent study showed despite high levels of obesity in the U.S., many people are undernourished. A diet of pizza, fries, crisps, pasta, rice, biscuits, cakes leaves many people consuming a lot of calories but few nutrients, says Dr Sally Norton, an NHS consultant specialising in weight loss and upper gastrointestinal surgery. The problem is exacerbated by coffee shops serving sugary and fatty drinks appearing in hospital foyers and junior doctors being given minimal training on nutrition. Drug companies push the sales of expensive drugs which treat the symptoms of the disease but not the cause, she says. Instead we should treat disease with nutrition, letting food be our medicine. Here, she gives her view... As a doctor, it never fails to astonish me how little training we are given  in good, sound nutrition, and how little emphasis we place on the role of eating well in preventing and curing disease in Western medicine. Need proof? Just look at the dismal food we serve to our patients in many hospitals, or the sugar and fat-filled snacks we offer in our hospital foyers. Look too at the multi-million pound drug industry that is encouraging us as doctors to treat type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease and other conditions related to poor nutrition with expensive drugs rather than healthier food. Hippocrates, the father of medicine, was so right when he said, over 2,000 years ago: 'let food be thy medicine'. And yet, fast-forward to the 21st century and a recent study of Americans shows that many Americans are undernourished. Yes, you read that correctly – despite the USA's high levels of obesity, much of its population is undernourished! For example, only 11 per cent of people meet the daily recommended intake of fibre and only 5 per cent consume recommended amounts of potassium. A large majority also fall short on vitamins A, C, D, calcium and iron – instead eating more saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium than recommended. These stats are so frustrating to me as a doctor – and I suspect the UK is no better. It may seem shocking that you can be both obese and undernourished, but perhaps it isn't so astonishing if you look at the nutrients in many of our regular snacks. Malnutrition is a word we usually associate with the tragically thin figures from TV news reports of third world famines. In fact, it's a shockingly common problem in Britain. Though not at starvation level, there are millions of patients who aren't getting sufficient calories, protein, vitamins and minerals. Overweight people can still be malnourished if they eat foods giving enough energy but no nutrients . Doctors say our growing reliance on fast food, coupled with soaring rates of binge-drinking, means many are lacking the vitamins and minerals essential for health. The result, in the most extreme cases, is pot-bellies, wasted limbs and emaciated bodies - all conditions more usually associated with famine victims in the developing world. While malnutrition can be fatal, in more mild forms it can cause a host of symptoms that impact on every day life, from hair loss and muscle wastage to food cravings and lethargy. How many nutrients do you get in biscuits, pieces of cake, crisps, fries, pizza, white rice, pasta and bread? Not a whole lot. So, if we are eating these 'nutrient deficient' foods regularly, we must make sure we are getting our nutrients from real, fresh, whole foods, too. Every day I read of yet another study that demonstrates how the food we eat is contributing to our ill-health, rather than nourishing and fuelling our bodies, and how, if we only ate a more nutritious diet, we could reduce our risk of illness and even treat problems we have already. I could list hundreds of examples – but here are a few that really highlight the power of good nutrition: . Heart . Researchers showed that a heart-healthy eating plan rich in fruits, vegetables and fish significantly reduced the chance of a second heart attack and stroke in people with cardiovascular disease. Diabetes . Another study from Harvard showed that eating more whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples, was significantly associated with a lower risk of type-2 diabetes. Mental Health . Various studies have linked a higher intake of omega 3 with improvements in mental health. Stroke . A Mediterranean eating pattern supplemented with nuts can reduce your stroke risk according to the American Heart Association's review of the literature. Cancer . Over 25 studies have shown that eating plenty of fibre reduces the risk of bowel cancer. All bad news? Not so. Firstly, what I've highlighted above actually gives the power back to the individual, away from the doctor. YOU can treat yourself and the prescription is simple – real, fresh, honest, unprocessed food in sensible portions. How great is that? These studies demonstrate that not only can you improve existing conditions (it's never too late!), but can also take great measures to prevent future illness – just by what you put in your shopping basket this week! Thomas Edison, the genius who invented the light-bulb, had another 'lightbulb' moment when he said this: . 'The doctor of the future will no longer treat the human frame with drugs, but rather will cure and prevent disease with nutrition'. That was around 100 years ago… it's about time we took his advice! Dr Sally Norton says changing a person's diet to prevent illness is not 'bad news' - instead it gives the power back to the individual, allowing them to improve existing conditions and prevent future illness .","Research shows many obese people are suffering from malnutrition .

Aliases have existed for ages, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.' While the increase in user requests is yet to be explained, many are claiming it is due to Facebook’s naming policy, which requires all users to go by their legal name. The policy was criticised, earlier this month, as several drag performers and activists said they had been locked out of their accounts for breaching the policy.

"It has been called Britain's most vulgar car - and now it could be yours for a six-figure sum. Student Daria Radionova is selling her bling-on-wheels Mercedes CLS 350 encrusted with one million Swarovski crystals just three weeks after it came to the world's attention. Bidding for the testament to pointless excess has reached £153,800, with 25 car enthusiasts of questionable taste vying for the chance to drive it home. Yet while boasting that the car would be sold for charity - only ten per cent of the final sale price will support Manchester & Cheshire Dogs' Home which was destroyed by fire, she has revealed. 'The car is now for sale in the eBay charity auction,' said the 21 year old ethnic Russian millionaire whose family live in Moldova, Europe's poorest country. Scroll down for video .

It was first unveiled three weeks ago and is now up for grabs . 'A part from the sale will go to support Manchester and Moldova Dog Homes.' The London-based student, who lives 300 feet from her favourite shop Harrods, boasted before putting the silver-coloured coupe on sale: 'When I sell the car I will give the money to charity.' It was not clear last night if any other causes would benefit from the glittering car which was valued at around £25,000. Daria disputed this, stating: 'The car cost at least £50,000, then I spent over £20,000 on the Swarovski crystals for it. 'It cost me another £15,000 to fly in my team from Russia to put them on the car for me. 'They spent 12 hours a day for two months doing it. I'm very happy with it - everywhere I go, people look at it.' The car - an early gift from her parents for her 21st birthday - also has an elite number plate BAII BYY.

The eBay site says the starting bid was for £89,999.00 - and the auction will end of 16 October. It has not attracted any bids so far. Daria had also said that any auction profit from her gleaming car would go to a charity 'to help homeless people'. Asked on Facebook why she was helping dogs rather than children, orphans or disabled people, she snapped back: 'Help them yourself.' Any buyers should be ready for unexpected attention with a car that has had two previous owners and 57,000 miles on the clock. 'It's quite scary to leave it in the street,' she said. 'People try to take the crystals. Every time I come back I have to check if any have gone. 'But I enjoy it. I know some people say negative things but I don't care what people think.'

"Cold mist and firework smoke gave the Etihad Stadium a peculiar type of gloom that perfectly symbolised Manchester City's current malaise as they limped to a latest damaging Champions League defeat. It wasn't just the result that set the alarm bells ringing for England's richest club – it was the attitude of their players, most particularly Yaya Toure, and supporters which will have Sheikh Mansour demanding answers. Manager Manuel Pellegrini was dignified afterwards, refusing to blame referee Tasos Sidiropoulos, who sent off two City players, failed to dismiss an already-booked CSKA player for shoving Sergio Aguero, and then denied Aguero an injury-time penalty. Imagine if it had been Neil Warnock addressing the media afterwards? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Stevan Jovetic: Manchester City deserved to lose to CSKA Moscow . Yaya Toure is sent off by Greek referee Tasos Sidiropoulos against CSKA Moscow on Wednesday night . Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (left) and chief executive Ferran Soriano watch on on Wednesday night . But Pellegrini has been in the game too long to know that City's failings go well beyond one hapless official, whatever the fans may think. When City were struggling in the third tier of English football, their supporters were known as the best in the country. But now they are among Europe's elite – or at least trying to join them – there is a strange lethargy about big nights at the Etihad compared to Old Trafford or Anfield. After seeing 10,000 seats go unused for their previous home game against Roma, City allowed fans to buy two-for-one against CSKA. It swelled the attendance but not the passion or atmosphere. Even the protest against UEFA by booing the Champions League anthem was a bit half-hearted. The first half was observed in near silence until the team were jeered off at the interval with the team 2-1 down. A Manchester City fan holds up a banner in protest against UEFA after CSKA Moscow fans defied their ban . At the end, the City fans were roused to shout 'cheat' at the referee – it was all very bitter and negative rather than getting behind the team from the off. Then again, can you blame the fans when some of the players appeared surprisingly disinterested and distracted? Some of Gael Clichy's defending was extreme to the maximum. He conceded a free-kick that allowed Seydou Doumbia to head the opening goal for CSKA. Even worse, after Toure had equalised with a trademark free-kick, Clichy hacked a simple pass across his own half straight to an opponent. Three touches later, Doumbia had beaten Joe Hart to restore Moscow's lead. Gael Clichy - who made mistakes for both goals - looks dejected as Seydou Doumbia celebrates . And then there's Toure. For so long the idol of City's fans who didn't begrudge his status as the Premier League's best player, he has developed into a caricature of a sulky, spoilt footballer this season. Already booked, his pointless shove on Roman Emerenko in the second half saw him follow Fernandinho down the tunnel and killed any City prospects of salvaging a draw. At least the Ivorian had the self-awareness to apologise later on social media. Yaya Toure is upended by CSKA's Swedish international midfielder Pontus Wernbloom . Toure lands awkwardly as a foul is given by the Greek referee for the foul by Wernbloom . Toure put in a performance at the Etihad Stadium despite his sublime early free-kick to equalise . There are mitigating factors to Toure's current mood. His younger brother died of cancer during the World Cup and the racial abuse he has received on Twitter is without doubt disturbing and unpleasant. Yet in this kind of form he is a liability to his team-mates. His lack of positional discipline and desire to track back and defend makes the job for his central midfield partners almost impossible. Fernando was totally over-run in the first half on Wednesday night. Pellegrini may be privately relieved Toure is now suspended for the next European game at home to Bayern Munich. We never really got to the bottom of 'Birthday Cakegate', when Toure was allegedly seething that City's Abu Dhabi owners hadn't marked his birthday by baking him a cake. The suspicion was he was trying to engineer a move back to Barcelona, when Barca failed to show much interest, he pledged his loyalty to City rather unconvincingly. Certainly, his influence on matches this season has been far less than in previous years. Pellegrini has to accept some blame as well. Given that Toure is a bit of a loose cannon in midfield, it seems strange that an experienced coach like himself will regularly leave his team outnumbered in the key central area. He let Gareth Barry and Javi Garcia, both natural sitting players, leave and won't start with Fernandinho, who was terrific last season. Fernandinho, who again did not start for City, jogs off the pitch after being red-carded on Wednesday night . The plans against CSKA were a mess. Fernando was expected to stop Moscow's counter-attacks almost single-handed while Stevan Jovetic, Jesus Navas and Toure ineffectually stood by. By the time he sent on Fernandinho to rectify it at half-time, the Brazilian was so pumped up, he got a quick yellow card. The manager then gambled by taking Fernando off for Edin Dzeko with City behind, leaving Fernandinho as the only natural holder – and then he got sent off. A tragedy of errors. Incidentally, the Brazilian also apologised for his red. If Pellegrini is at fault tactically, the owners can't avoid some degree of responsibility. Their historic breaking of the Financial Fair Play regulations means the manager has been forced to pick a reduced squad for the Champions League this season. Strikers Alvaro Negredo and John Guidetti have been loaned out because there is no room for them, leaving Pellegrini having to chase four trophies with just three strikers. Alvaro Negredo left City to join Valencia on loan for the season in August but was not replaced . John Guidetti was allowed to join Celtic on loan and has been prolific north of the border . Manuel Pellegrini has plenty of questions to answer after City remained winless in Europe this season . VIDEO Pellegrini defends City's discipline . He has said that Angel di Maria and Falcao were never options because City couldn't afford their transfer fees or wages under the FFP restrictions. On the bright side, City have been here before – in both title-winning seasons under Roberto Mancini and Pellegrini, they were written off at stages in the season but dug in when nobody else believed, and came out on top. Bayern's dominance of their Champions League group means the second spot is still up for grabs. A victory against the German champions, who have already qualified, will set up a likely winner-takes-all meeting away to Roma. Difficult, but not impossible for a team who have Aguero and David Silva on their books. The continuing presence of Sergio Aguero at the Etihad is a major positive for City and their fans . The truth is that the fault for City's current problems have to be shared between manager, star players, owners and fans. Only by rallying together can they turn this around. If they each act with the petulance of Toure's childish shove, they are in big trouble.","Manchester City beaten 2-1 at home by CSKA Moscow on Wednesday .

"Peter Lewis has been sacked as head of Somerset's children's services amid allegations that a member of his staff had sex with a 16-year-old girl in care . Britain's highest paid council boss has been sacked as head of Somerset's children's services amid allegations that a member of his staff had sex with a 16-year-old girl in care. Peter Lewis, who received £318,500-a-year, was fired weeks after two children's homes were shut following claims children used drugs and were at risk from sexual and criminal exploitation. A council whistleblower said the service was in 'chaos' and claimed the abuse involving the 16-year-old was not an isolated incident. Mr Lewis was brought in to improve the service which was rated 'inadequate' in an Ofsted report last year, but his performance has been described as 'disappointing'. His pay package was questioned after a string of critical reports resurfaced regarding the deaths of two children in suspected abuse cases from his time as director of children's services in Enfield. In the same month that Mr Lewis was dismissed from his Somerset post, police reopened an inquiry into claims that a council employee had been having sex with a girl in care. The case was examined but dropped in 2013 when the man, who subsequently resigned, denied the allegations. A report was critical of the employee's manager for creating an atmosphere that permitted 'inappropriate sexual boundaries'. The fresh investigation followed a recent meeting with Lewis when new evidence came to light, according to a council whistleblower. 'No one in the senior levels of the department was taking this seriously enough, so I felt it was my duty to report it to police myself,' he told the Sunday Times. 'I could not say whether [the police] were already aware of it but it seems the issue is now being investigated properly. 'This is not an isolated incident as far as I'm concerned. Children's services here are in total chaos and they have not been improved under Lewis.' Police said the inquiry was at an early stage and no arrests have been made. A Somerset County Council whistleblower said the service was in 'chaos' and claimed the abuse involving the 16-year-old was not an isolated incident . The council said there was no evidence that the girl was under the age of consent when the alleged sexual relationship took place. West End Cottage at Chedzoy and Appledore near West Pennard, both run by Somerset County Council, were deemed 'inadequate'. A report from one of the care homes, said: 'Going missing from home, substance misuse, exploitation and engaging in harmful relationships are commonplace for some young people.' On two occasions at the same home 'inappropriate physical intervention' has been used by staff against young people, resulting in distress and on one occasion, injury, the report said. Edward Timpson, the children's minister, has called council officials to an emergency meeting to discuss the situation. Chief Executive of Somerset County Council, Pat Flaherty, said: 'I came into my post six months ago, and I gave Peter and his team time to prove themselves to me. It is hugely disappointing that results have not matched expectations. 'We have put in extra budgets and extra staff including more children's social workers. 'This has brought improvements which the government has recognised but sadly not at the level or speeds anticipated and the current situation with our children's homes and children's centres is just not good enough.'","Peter Lewis was fired weeks after two Somerset children's homes were shut .

It is just three weeks until Hodgson's side kick-off in Group D against Italy in the tricky conditions of Manaus, deep in the heart of the Amazon. England are spending time in the Algarve and Miami in preparation for the expected hot and humid conditions, although their training camp in Portugal has not exactly gone to plan so far weather-wise. The squad arrived in Vale do Lobo on Monday and, after torrential rain on Tuesday, were greeted by blustery conditions for their first and only open training session on Wednesday.

"Picture the scene. A beautiful spring Monday morning. The Humber Bridge glistened in the sunlight. Birdsong filled the air, blossom falling from trees and a feeling of hope among all those lucky enough to be outdoors on that glorious day. Around a hundred members of the local Women’s Institute were enjoying the day as they’d planned a march across the bridge. As they strolled along, they took in those beautiful sights and sounds. The sun’s rays bouncing off the river. The larks whistling to one another. And myself and Nick Barmby rolling around on the grass, yelling and throwing punches at each other. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Bullard reveal some of his greatest pranks and wind-ups . Fighter: Jimmy Bullard tells all about how he once came to blows with Hull City team-mate Nick Barmby . Tension: The duo played together on Humberside between 2009-11 . Funny man: Former Fulham midfielder Jimmy Bullard tells it like it is in his new book Bend it like Bullard . That was probably the most ridiculous situation I’ve ever been in as a footballer, and I say that having had my head shut in a door by Paul Jewell. If you’re ever going to have a fight with someone, I would highly recommend not doing it in front of a hundred pensioners. Dave Whelan was brilliant at bringing us all together at Wigan and was never shy with his generosity. After one season, we were sitting in the dressing room, and he walked in with a huge leather sports bag. ‘Right, boys, listen up,’ he said. ‘You’ve achieved what we wanted to achieve so share this between you.’ And as he ended his sentence, he slid the bag across the floor and walked out. We all looked at each other, thinking the same thing - there must be cash in the bag. Our skipper Arjan de Zeeuw opened up the hold-all, peeped inside it, then looked up with a smile on his face. ‘It’s cash, boys!’ There must have been about £250,000 in there, which we all received a cut of in our next pay packet. I was absolutely furious with Nick, and the scrap just happened to take place in the car park by the Humber Bridge because the gaffer had decided that’s where we were going to have our warm-down that morning. It was the day after we’d been hammered by Everton live on telly in my first game back after my third knee injury. Not the ideal return, especially when you consider I had also had a stand-up row with Nick in the dressing room at half-time. And, as is always the case with these football flashpoints, it had started over something so stupid. We went a goal down after Mikel Arteta had run unchallenged on to a deep, back-post cross. Nick was supposed to have picked him up, but was yards behind when Arteta volleyed in. Nick was normally a fantastic presence at the back post, very good in the air and always covered danger thanks to his good positional sense. But, for whatever reason, he’d gone AWOL. Not a  disaster as there were only 17  minutes gone. During a break in play, I ran past Barmby and said: ‘I thought you were comfortable at the back post there, Nick?’ ‘F***ing comfortable!’ came his angry reply. ‘You f***ing cheeky b******!’ Whoah! I really hadn’t meant that much by the comment, other than expressing my disappointment because he was usually so good. He obviously felt like I was digging him out, but that’s football and these things happen. I attempted to defuse the  situation: ‘Hang on a minute, all I said was that I thought you were comfortable on the back stick. We’re still in the game, it doesn’t matter.’ But he was still muttering away at me, and clearly not in a complimentary way. We came in at half-time 2-1 down, still in the game, but Nick wasn’t interested in that. Stalwart: Barmby made 180 league appearances for Hull City, before also going on to manage the club . Joker: Bullard leading Hull's famous celebration after scoring against Manchester City . TJ Moncur was a young player at Fulham. One morning he came in for training in a new Peugeot 206 convertible. Once he’d cleared off, I grabbed a huge wheelie bin, filled it with water and poured it into his car. Which was quite funny, but not as funny as two wheelie bins full of water in it. Alas, there was CCTV. After training, TJ and the boys gathered round a screen in the club office to see footage of me pouring water into his car. ‘Was that you in the car park, Jim?’ someone asked. ‘Errrr, no.’ Luckily, the warm weather dried the car out. He was waiting for me and, in front of the whole team and management, he lost the plot and crossed a line. Instead of sticking to what happened on the pitch, he brought money — specifically my Hull contract — into it. ‘This club paid £5million for you and pays you £45,000 a week,’ he was ranting, as if to say I needed to be doing more to justify my wages. I was incensed. How on earth had he gone from being p****d off about me having a go at him on the pitch to talking about my contract? I was more aware than anyone of how much I owed the club, seeing as I was playing only my seventh game for Hull in more than a year, because of two serious knee injuries. But I certainly didn’t need him discussing my personal business in the middle of the dressing room at half-time. I was raging inside and I could see some of the other boys were  shaking their heads implying that Nick was out of order but what I didn’t get, and still don’t to this day, is why (manager) Phil Brown or any of the management team never got involved. ‘Don’t worry,’ I said, fuming. ‘You’ve obviously got a bee in your bonnet about me. It’s not about money. We’ve let a goal in and now you’re digging out my contract. We’ll sort it out tomorrow.’ ‘Anytime, anywhere,’ was his reply as we all stormed back out on the pitch to concede three more goals and get pasted. Prone: Bullard suffered from bad injury problems during his time at Hull . Mediator: Phil Brown brought Jimmy Bullard to Humberside for £5million . There must’ve been at least a dozen cameras as I sat there at Upton Park. After what felt like forever, Harry Redknapp introduced us to the press. ‘Afternoon, thanks for coming. I’m pleased to be able to present our new signings. We have Paolo Di Canio, . Marc-Vivien Foe, Gavin Holligan and, er . . . what’s your name?’ I was utterly devastated. But it came to him: ‘Er, Jim. Jimmy Bullard.’ The world knew my name. Fame and glory awaited. All I had to do was get on the pitch; that proved to be a lot harder than I thought. That night, I couldn’t sleep a wink. I was so angry. I wanted to kill Nick Barmby and that’s all I could think about. The gaffer had decided we’d have our warm-down session out by the Humber Bridge, rather than pore over hours of video analysis. We’d been there before, it’s a mile-and-a-half each way during which we’d do walking and jogging, then back to the club for ice baths and massages. I would certainly need cooling down when we got back. I travelled to the bridge in my team-mate Richard Garcia’s car and he sensed something was up. But I barely noticed because I was focused on Barmby. Richard parked and, as we got out, I spotted my nemesis and the red mist descended. ‘Come here you,’ I said. ‘We’ve got to have a word, haven’t we?’ As Nick walked towards me, I reached out to grab him and he threw a punch at my head straight away. Within seconds we were having a proper ding-dong, rolling around on the ground, trying to belt the c*** out of each other. We were both throwing punches, but none really seemed to land. I was so full of anger and adrenaline that I probably wouldn’t have felt it if Nick had landed one in any case. Jumping for joy: Bullard celebrates scoring a penalty against Arsenal for Hull City . Fresh start: Bullard worked as a pundit for BT Sport at the FA Cup final between Arsenal and Hull on Saturday . I’d love to be able to say that I sorted . him out, but the truth is that it was little more than explosive . grappling for a few seconds. As the gaffer said later, it was hardly . Ali-Frazier. We both ended up lying on a bush with no real leverage to . get out of it so loads of the boys dived in to split us up. Steve Parkin, the assistant manager, walked me down the path, while the rest took Nick and headed in the opposite direction. Except nobody realised that this particular path followed a circular route, meaning that after a few minutes we all met up again. As soon as I saw Barmby again, I launched myself at him. This time, he was protected by Amr Zaki and Kamil Zayatte, like two blocks of flats. I just bounced off them and had to call it a day. Just when it seemed like things couldn’t have got any worse, the gaffer started receiving complaints from members of the WI. They had called into the club and the local radio station, appalled by what they’d seen - and I don’t mean our wild (and wildly ineffective) fighting styles, which they would have had every right to criticise.

"David Letterman's Late Show cue-card holder of more than two decades was fired last week after picking a physical fight with one of the show's writers on set at the Ed Sullivan theater. Cue-card holder Tony Mendez, 69, told the New York Post that the altercation with 57-year-old writer Bill Scheft was a long time coming, since Mr Scheft was constantly 'encroaching' and 'undermining' his work. However, Mr Mendez admits grabbing Mr Scheft by the collar was wrong,  and he holds nothing against Letterman for his dismissal after 21 years working for the late night king. Scroll down for video . Drama on the Late Show set: David Letterman's long-time cue-card holder was fired last week after getting into a fight with a Late Show writer . Showdown: Cue-card holder Tony Mendez (left) said the fight with Bill Scheft (right) was a long time coming since Mr Scheft was constantly 'encroaching' on his work. Mr Mendez says he snapped on October 9 and grabbed the writer by the collar, after getting into an argument the day before during rehearsals . Mr Mendez  says the fight on October 9 stemmed from an argument he had with the writer while rehearsing backstage with Letterman the day before. Mr Scheft allegedly interrupted the cue-card holder in the middle of work when Mr Mendez spit back: 'I know what I'm doing. Get off my back.' Letterman then jumped to his writer's defense, saying: 'Tony, your sour disposition isn't helping.' ""'You’re the one who has the sour disposition, m***********,""' Mr Mendez snapped. While Mr Mendez says he and Letterman often use profanity when speaking to each other, he admits he was hurt that Letterman didn't take his side in the argument. 'That night I wanted to tell Dave how much that hurt my feelings,' Mr Mendez said. 'And then I realized that this is what Bill was doing. He was trying to create a wedge between us so Dave would think I was an a******.' Mr Mendez says he dwelled on that moment all night, and snapped the next morning when he saw Mr Scheft on set. 'I just grabbed him by the shirt,' Mr Mendez said. 'He was very surprised. He didn’t say a word. He was cowering, his eyes were real big, he probably peed a little bit on his pants.' 'I’m the first one to say I should have never put my hands on him, but I never hit him. I just grabbed him and got my face in his face,' he added. The cue-card holder was immediately kicked out of the theater, and four days later he received a call from the show's executive producer, informing him that he had been 'officially terminated'. Veteran: Mendez (pictured on the right, next to the camera, has been working for Letterman for more than two decades . However, Mr Mendez was offered his salary and health insurance through Letterman's final months on the show. He is expected to retire in May, and will be replaced by comedian Stephen Colbert, current host of Comedy Central's Colbert Report. While Mr Mendez is sad to be leaving the Late Show, he says he has no ill feelings towards Letterman and doesn't believe the host was involved in his firing. 'Dave has never let me down,' he said. 'He is the best, the most generous boss I have ever had. Dave would never do anything to harm me.' A spokesman for Letterman's production company Worldwide Pants declined MailOnline's request for comment.","Cue-card holder Tony Mendez has been fired from the Late Show after 21 years working for Letterman .

"Feeling hungry inside an airport rarely has a happy ending. The choice tends to be between a soggy sandwich or a soggy sandwich. If you leave it until the flight to sate your appetite you might be rewarded with an even soggier sandwich. But it doesn't have to be like that. Recent years have seen the growth of a stellar line up of dining options at concourses around the world as chefs wake up to the opportunity of a captive customer with time to kill, a rumbling stomach and money to burn. To prove the point Condé Nast Traveler - for the first time - has compiled a list recognising some of the best airport restaurants and dishes from around the world for their October 2014 issue. Surf and turf: Palm Bar & Grille at John F. Kennedy airport in New York where you can also order a Bozzi burger with aged Gouda and crispy fried onions . Rick Bayless' Tortas Frontera at Chicago's O'Hare airport particularly stood out  for its salads, short rib tortas, smoked pork mollete and margaritas . To judge it they recruited Michelin star and renowned chefs including Daniel Boulud, Grant Achatz, Richard Blais and Jamie Bissonnette. Their gourmet list covers everything from roast duck noodles to oysters, caviar, margaritas, bloody Marys and sushi  in airport restaurants and takeaways from London to New York and Singapore to Dubai. Not one but three venues were chosen from London's Heathrow terminals. The panel of foodies commended Carluccio's for its 'wonderful' eggs and coffee, Gordon Ramsay's Plane Food for its butter chicken curry with fried chickpea rice and Caviar House & Prunier Seafood Bar for serving delectable caviar and champagne. However, the airport with the largest number of eateries included is San Francisco, which had five restaurants in the list. In Tokyo's International Airport Sushi Kyotatsu's the fish is 'superb', there's a fantastic view of planes taking off and  queues down the corridor to order . First class: three venues were picked out from London's Heathrow terminals including Caviar House & Prunier which serves caviar, salmon and champagne . Venice: if you travel through Marco Polo Airport,  Rustichelli & Mangione's mozzarella pomodoro pane tostato and pizzas cannot be beaten . The Traveler judges agreed that Rick Bayless' Tortas Frontera at Chicago O'Hare particularly stood out from the rest. Chef Michael Chernow said it has 'the best airport food I've had to date,' and chef Anita Lo added it 'is one of the few that actually deliver and live up to the chef's name.' Pick off braised short rib tortas, smoked pork mollete and margaritas from their menu when you visit. Order the Bozzi burger with aged Gouda, smoky barbecue sauce, and crispy fried onions from Palm Bar & Grille if you find yourself in John F.

It's a perfect farewell to Japan.' The restaurant has queues formed down the corridor for a table or takeaway. Elsewhere - according to Traveler - at Venice's Marco Polo Airport in Rustichelli & Mangione the mozzarella pomodoro pane tostato is divine, Cádiz Tapas in Dubai is a great place to wind down with a glass of wine and, if you are looking for pizza, nothing beats Metro Pizza in Las Vegas's McCarran terminal. Metro is Jon Gray's, vice president of Linq in Las Vegas, go-to venue for a slice of pepperoni pizza before long haul trips. Are you sitting comfortably?

While the panel were busy discussing the serious subject on how to prevent Australians from joining the Islamic State, the program cut to the auburn-haired man, who vaguely resembled the ginger jihadist. Scroll down for video . During a heated conversation on the topic of terrorism and particularly on Australian-born ginger jihadist Abdullah Elmir, the camera shifts suddenly from the panel and focuses in on a man in the audience. The man appeared to be unaware that the camera has focused on him and continued to listen intently to the discussion. The panel also continued on with their ramblings, blissfully unaware of the hiccup, as they debated whether the Afghanistan experience has taught us anything. However, Twitter users were quick to point out the programs fault, taking to their accounts to vent their anger. While the panel were busy discussing the serious subject on how to prevent Australians from joining the Islamic State, the program cut to the auburn-haired man, who vaguely resembled the ginger jihadist . 'They always cut to inappropriate on this show' wrote Mark Sanderson. 'Not sure if 'ginger jihadi' or Newtown hipster. #qanda' said ASIO . The major fail came just a week after a propaganda video released by Islamic State appeared online,featuring Australian Abdullah Elmir. The man appeared to be unaware that the camera has focused on him and continued to listen intently to the discussion . The 17-year-old, who grew up in Bankstown in Sydney's west, also appeared in another video today. The teen is seen in the latest video on the banks of the river Tigris, surrounded by dozens of men dressed in black wielding weapons. The video is titled An Evening On The Banks Of The Tigris River In The Province Of Nineveh In The Islamic State, and shows groups of militants chanting and praying. Just last week Elmir appeared in a chilling video where he condemned Barack Obama and Tony Abbott . At some points the teenager, who grew up in Bankstown in Sydney's west, appears to stifle a smile or laughter .

Earlier this week reports Elmir could face 25 years behind bars should he ever return to Australian soil emerged. AFP counterterrorism head Neil Gaughan told the Herald Sun that Elmir, who now goes by the moniker Abu Khaled, has 'basically admitted he is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation'. 'The fact that he is admitting that he is a member of ISIS, which he does in the video, straight away says that he has committed an offence under the criminal code. That’s up to 25 years imprisonment,' he said.

"It’s the biggest away game of the season for the Spanish Champions, but with three days to go before kick-off Atletico Madrid have sold just 30 tickets for their visit to the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.

He also warned the Prime Minister that it would be a ‘tall order’ for the SAS to hunt down the British killer filmed beheading hostages Alan Henning and David Haines. His remarks came after David Cameron ordered Britain’s spy chiefs to find the ISIS killer known as ‘Jihadi John’ dead or alive. Speaking to the Andrew Marr show this morning, Lord Richards said: ‘Of course all of us in a visceral response to what's happened would like to see that,’ he said. ‘But as good as the SAS are, they are also rightly very cautious and I think to expect them to do that is a tall order and it needs to be part of this grander strategy.’ His remarks came after he attacked the Government’s military cuts, which will see the regular Army cut from 102,000 serving soldiers to just 82,000. The cuts will be partially offset by an increase in the size of the Army Reserve from 19,000 to 30,000. Lord Richards, who stepped down last year, said the present strength was too small to deal with what the Prime Minister has called a ‘generational struggle’ against Islamic extremists. ‘The reservist plan could yet be made to work within two or three years but we are now in a different era,’ Lord Richards told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show. ‘This needs to be put right quickly. If it can be then fine, I will go along with that solution. ‘But my instinct is it can't be and we need to go back to the drawing board and revise the size of the regular Army back up again. ‘If we are talking about a generational struggle, as I think the Prime Minister is and he is absolutely right ... then we need an Army that can sustain a demanding operation not just in Syria and Iraq potentially, in a support role, but think of all the other places where Muslim extremism is causing havoc.' He added: ‘I am thinking Nigeria, Kenya is very fragile, the countries around Syria that need more help like Jordan and obviously Iraq and perhaps Lebanon. And then you go into Afghanistan, Pakistan needs more assistance, even al Qaida leadership I saw talking about creating the same sort of problems in places like Myanmar. ‘We have to see the grand strategic challenge which is confronting us all now and that, I'm afraid, needs a grand strategic response of the type that our forebears dealt with.’ Lord Richards said it was a ‘no-brainer’ that UK operations should extend anti-IS operations from Iraq into Syria. ‘I am very clear that that is the view of the Prime Minister and most of his party. His problem is delivering the politics that allow us to do that,’ he said. He said not enough was being done to train Iraqi and Syrian ground forces to take on IS. ‘You either have to put your own boots on the ground at some point or else you have to very energetically and aggressively train up those who will do that with us and for us. My worry at the moment is that the scale of the challenge isn't being met by the right scale of response. ‘I am worried that without more intensive use of Western boots on the ground in a support role then we won't do it in the time we need to get on and do this in.’ David Cameron praised British soldiers on a surprise visit to Afghanistan last week. But he warned that the struggle against Islamist terror would last a 'generation' But, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he disagreed with the former army chief’s remarks. He said Britain needed to take the threat from militant groups like IS ‘extremely seriously’, but added this may not necessarily require an increase in conventional forces. ‘How you respond to it is not quite as straightforward as David Richards - much though I respect him - suggests. I don't think it's a question of simply ramping up conventional armed forces again as if we were fighting state-to-state conflicts. ‘Increasingly what you are having is states co-operating together in a jigsaw operation where different countries bring to the effort different capabilities against stateless mobile groups.’ Asked about joining US-led air strikes in Syria, he told Marr: ‘I wouldn't advocate that we extend the air campaign into Syria. ‘It won't come to a vote unless the Government proposes it and the Government is not proposing it right now. ‘We need to persuade the British people and Parliament as well that every time we put servicemen and women in harm's way we do so with a clear strategy in mind, and I think the combination of air strikes and ground forces needs to be properly thought through. ‘That was obvious in Iraq, it's a little more complicated in Syria.’","Government is cutting the Army from 102,000 serving soldiers to just 82,000 .

"The use of fossil fuels must be phased out by the end of the century, UN scientists have warned despite growing concerns over energy supplies. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued stark predictions that continued greenhouse gas emissions will cause 'severe, pervasive and irreversible' impacts around the world. In its latest assessment of global warming, which was published yesterday, it urged governments to cut carbon dioxide emissions by up to 70 per cent by 2050. The use of fossil fuels must be phased out by the end of the century, UN scientists have warned. Pictured, Drax Power Station in Selby, North Yorkshire - the UK's single largest emitter of carbon dioxide . The authors said fossil fuels would need to be phased out completely from electricity production by 2100 unless new technology could safely bury carbon dioxide from power stations underground to prevent it from being released into the atmosphere. Critics warned, however, that growing reliance upon renewable energy to replace fossil fuels will increase the risk of power blackouts in Britain. They also said that consumers would see their energy bills soaring to pay for the new technologies outlined in the report. The report comes at a time when Britain is already facing a growing risk of electricity blackouts as the country attempts to switch to renewable forms of energy. Owen Paterson, the former environment secretary, has also warned that Britain's current climate change targets will cause severe energy supply shortages in the future. However, Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the IPCC, warned that the cost of delaying action to tackle climate change would be 'proportionally higher'. He said: 'The world needs a combination of adaptation and mitigation. 'We will not be able to adapt to the impacts of climate change if we don't to anything to tackle the root of the problem. The impacts will exceed our capacity to cope with them. 'In the absence of carbon capture and storage then power generation from fossil fuels would need to be phased out by the end of this century if we want to limit temperature increases to 2C.' The report by UN scientists urged governments to be less reliant on mining for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas (file picture) More than two thirds of the Britain's electricity comes from fossil fuels and cutting down on coal, oil and gas use is seen as a major challenge. Renewable energy from unreliable sources such as wind farms also need to be backed up by coal or gas fueled power stations to prevent power shortages. Britain's reliance on wind energy has already raised concerns about its ability to keep the lights on. Last month, energy watchdog Ofgem announced emergency plans amid fears Britain's ability to cope with peaks in power demand this winter will fall to its lowest level in seven years. Mothballed coal and gas fired power plants are to be brought back into use and businesses are to be paid to switch off their power at peak times. The IPCC report says that fossil fuels could continue to be used beyond 2100 in conjuction with carbon capture and storage, which traps and buries carbon dioxide gas in power station chimneys. However, the technology yet to be tested on a large scale and is seen as being an expensive solution. Britain's first full-scale gas carbon capture storage project, which aims to build a plant in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, is still being designed. Dr Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Forum think tank set up former chancellor Lord Lawson, said phasing out of fossil fuels could have a major impact on the British and European economy. He said: 'Europe is already hurting from green policies as they are having a detrimental impact on industry and energy costs. 'There is nothing to replace the reliance on cheap fossil fuels in many parts of the world, which is why there is never going to be a realistic global agreement on cutting carbon dioxide emissions.' Professor Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex who was one of the contributors to the IPCC, said the report was 'alarmist'. Earlier this year he withdrew his name from the final draft of the report in protest at what he believes is bias selection of the authors and evidence presented. He said: 'It is a long way until 2100 but carbon capture storage at a scale large enough to make a serious dent in emissions strikes me a optimistic. It would require too many pipelines, too much storage.' Critics warned that phasing out fossil fuels before the world has more reliable green energy sources would affect living standards. Pictured, North Hoyle off-shore wind farm near Rhyl, north Wales . Douglas Carswell, Ukip MP for Clacton, warned that phasing out fossil fuels before the world is ready would be disastrous. He said: 'There is no form of energy available that is able to replace fossil fuels in terms of the energy it produces. 'The invention of machinery that can exploit fossil fuels and fertilisers based on fossil fuels are what have caused a revolution in living standards. 'Take that away and we return back to a pre-industrial revolution standard of living.' Owen Paterson, the former environment secretary, warned last month that Britain will struggle to 'keep the lights on' unless the Government changed its policy to cut carbon emissions by 2050. At the time he said: 'The 2050 target of cutting emissions by 80 percent, requires the almost complete decarbonisation of the electricity supply in 36 years. 'In the short and medium term, costs to consumers will rise dramatically, and the lights would eventually go out.' The new IPCC Synthesis Report is intended as a summary of three previous reports compiled over a five year period to assess the latest evidence on climate change and its impacts. It is expected to act as a guide for government officials and policy makers as they begin intense negotiations to set new limits on carbon emissions at a UN summit in Paris next year. Speaking at the launch of the report, Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary General, said he hoped the report would help world leaders decide how to tackle climate change when they meet in Peru for a UN climate summit next month. He said: 'Science has spoken. There is no ambiguity in the message. Leaders must act. Time is not on our side.' The report suggests a number of options that could help the world adapt and tackle climate change, including saying that many people will have to change their diets and grow new types of food. It warns that methane emissions from livestock and greenhouse gas emissions from fertiliser contribute considerably to global warming. Although it does not go into detail about what changes to diet should be, climate change experts have previously suggested eating vegetarian food, growing crops that can cope with more extreme weather and alternative sources of protein including insects.","Fossil fuels 'must be phased out by 2100', a report by the UN has warned .

"The unprecedented drought currently afflicting California is 'very likely' linked to human-caused climate change, researchers have found. They say a persistent region of high atmospheric pressure hovering over the Pacific Ocean that diverted storms away from California was much more likely to form in the presence of modern greenhouse gas concentrations. It is one of the most comprehensive studies to investigate the link between climate change and California's ongoing drought. An irrigation canal that is drying up near Yuba City, Calif. California's third year of drought ends Tuesday Sept. 30 and California Department of Water Resource Director Mark Cowin said it is essential to use water sparingly as the state faces the possibility of a fourth dry winter. The unprecedented drought currently afflicting California is 'very likely' linked to human-caused climate change, researchers have found. The exceptional drought currently crippling California is by some metrics the worst in state history. Combined with unusually warm temperatures and stagnant air conditions, the lack of precipitation has triggered a dangerous increase in wildfires and incidents of air pollution across the state. A recent report estimated that the water shortage would result in direct and indirect agricultural losses of at least $2.2 billion and lead to the loss of more than 17,000 seasonal and part-time jobs in 2014 alone. Such impacts prompted California Gov. Jerry Brown to declare a drought emergency and the federal government to designate all 58 California counties as 'natural disaster areas.' The report found that high-pressure ridges like the one that stubbornly parked itself over the Pacific Ocean for the past two winters, blocking storms from hitting California, are much more likely to form in the presence of man-made greenhouse gases. The ridge, dubbed the Ridiculously Resilient Ridge by researchers, or 'Triple R,' parched the state during the past two rainy seasons. 'You can visualize it as a fairly large boulder in a small stream,' said Daniel Swain, a lead author on the report, which said the phenomenon has caused storms to bypass not only California but also Oregon and Washington, pushing rain as far north as the Arctic Circle. Using climate model simulations, the researchers found that 'Triple-R' events are three times more likely to occur today than in preindustrial climates. House boats are docked at Lake Shasta's Bay Bridge resort near Redding, Calif.  After three years of drought the water level at the lake has dramatically receded. Scientists also determined that as long as high levels of greenhouse gases remain, severe droughts could become more frequent. 'California is more likely to see these episodes in the near term,' said environmental scientist Noah Diffenbaugh, who led the study. Despite the findings, Thomas Peterson, principal scientist at NOAA's National Climactic Data Center and one of the report's editors, said it is still hard to definitively link rainfall to climate change. 'There is so much variability in rainfall,' Peterson said. 'Finding a signal and attributing how much of the signal is climate change is difficult.' Marty Hoerling, a research meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who edited some of the reports in the climate study, said atmospheric pressure has increased everywhere due to global warming, so the systems need to be studied in that context. 'It's not the pressure, per se, that determines which way the storms will move,' Hoerling said during a press conference. 'But it's the difference of how the pressure changes from one location relative to another.'","Persistent region of high atmospheric pressure hovering over the Pacific Ocean diverted storms away from California .

"A woman went into labour early with her twins because she was laughing so hard at a Lee Evans show. Kayleigh Taylor and her husband Ross had been waiting for a year to the see the comedian at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre. But the gig was cut short for them on Tuesday night when Kayleigh's waters broke when she was 30 weeks pregnant. Surprise! Kayleigh Taylor and her husband Ross became parents seven weeks earlier than expected . Kayleigh, 29, and Ross, 36, from Portlethen, in Aberdeenshire dashed off to the hospital and six hours later their sons Reece and Riley were born. Kayleigh said she was still in shock over their early arrival. She said: 'We were sitting watching Lee Evans and I honestly thought I had peed myself laughing - my bladder wasn't as good as it normally is. 'I turned to my husband and told him I was going to the toilet because I thought I'd peed myself. 'But when I stood up and was going to the bathroom I realised it wasn't that.' Kayleigh said she did not expect to go into labour half way through a Lee Evans show. She added: 'I don't know why but I thought it was going to happen in the house - you just don't think it is going to happen anywhere else.' Too funny: Kayleigh's waters broke when she was laughing at stand up comic Lee Evans . Missed the end of the show: Kayleigh and Ross had to rush from a Lee Evans gig to the maternity ward after she went into premature labour . Her husband was oblivious to the fact that his wife had gone into labour at the AECC. But when she failed to return he quickly realised something was wrong. By this time a first aid team and a doctor were helping the mother-to-be and trying to make her as comfortable as possible. Ross said: 'When she didn't come back from the toilet I went to find her. 'All I could see was the doctor and staff running about and it turned out she was in labour.' Ross drove Kayleigh to Aberdeen Maternity Hospital where the couple welcomed their twin boys seven weeks early. The support engineer said the couple were worried at the time because Kayleigh was not expected to give birth so soon. Early arrival: Baby Reece (he has a twin brother, Riley) He added: 'It was quite worrying because we were only at 30 weeks but everything is okay now. They arrived at 2.30am weighing 3lbs each. 'They are in the special care unit just now and will be there for four to five weeks. They are so small but are in a really good place, getting round-the-clock care.' The couple, who have been married since 2012, conceived the babies through IVF treatment. They used one embryo egg which split so they know the boys will grow up as identical twins. Kayleigh said the labour went well despite it being unexpected. And the training competence co-ordinator said it was great to have such a fantastic story to tell all her family and friends. She joked: 'People have been saying we should call them Lee and Evans, but I think we will stick to the names we have.' Ross added that the next time the funnyman is in town they'll be first in line for tickets. He said: 'We'll certainly be queuing up if he comes back. I'd quite like to see how the show ends.'","Pregnant Kayleigh and husband Ross were at stand up's gig in Aberdeen .

"The devastated mother of a British backpacker killed in a car crash said she does not want to see her daughter's body as she does not want that to be her last memory. Jade Fox, 22, was travelling through Fraser Island in Queensland when it is believed she fatally hit her head when the 4x4 vehicle she was in overturned at around 2pm on Friday. She was travelling with seven other friends who all survived the crash with minor injuries. Jade Fox, 22, died after the four-wheel drive she was a passenger in flipped over on Friday . Ms Fox, from Maidstone in Kent posted an update on Facebook on the morning of her death. She said: 'Up early doors to travel Frazer Island for three days.' Her father Chris has travelled to Australia to arrange the repatriation of her body. Speaking to the BBC, her mother Melanie, 46, said before heading to Australia, she asked her daughter to be careful: 'I always told her if anything happened to her I couldn't cope or with any of them and I said you need to look after yourself, but I couldn't stop her living her dream. 'Her dad says he wants to hold her and see her, I don't think he believes it, but I don't want to see her broken, I just want to remember her how she was.

"One in ten GPs earns more than the Prime Minister, official figures show. Despite efforts to rein in the pay of family doctors, many still receive vastly more than David Cameron’s annual salary of £142,500. A total of 3,430 general practitioners earned more than £150,000 in 2012/13 – 10.5 per cent of self-employed GPs – according to the figures, published yesterday by the Government’s Health and Social Care Information Centre. A total of 3,430 general practitioners earned more than £150,000 in 2012/13 (picture posed by model) Some 630 were paid more than £200,000 and 160 received in excess of £250,000. Last night campaigners criticised the ‘telephone-number salaries’, saying they would anger patients who have difficulty getting an appointment with their GP. The official figures also reveal a huge disparity in pay levels between male and female GPs. Men on average were paid £109,400 – spending another £169,000 on office expenses and staff salaries. Women doctors, in contrast, received £73,800 and spent another £101,100 on expenses and salaries. The figures actually reveal a slight decline in pay since 2011/12. Contractor GPs – those 80 per cent of family doctors who are partners in their surgery – received an average £102,000 last year, a £1,000, or 0.9 per cent, decrease on the year before. But their pay is still vastly higher than a decade ago thanks to a controversial contract that also allowed them to stop working out of hours. Before the contract – brought in by Labour in 2004 – GPs earned an average of £77,000 a year. That leaped to £110,000 after the contract was introduced, but has been gradually falling ever since as ministers try to get a grip on their pay. The other 20 per cent of GPs are salaried. They are paid by their practices and earn much less. The Treasury has imposed a freeze on public sector pay, but it cannot make contractor GPs – who are self-employed – pay themselves any less. Gender pay gap: Male doctors were paid an average of £109,000, but women were received £73,800 (file pic) Instead the Government has put strict limits on the increase in the overall contract sum payable to surgeries – the money out of which GPs have to take their salaries. The official pay report, which is based on HM Revenue and Customs data, shows that the average gross figure available to GPs for running their practices rose by 1.4 per cent in 2012/2013. But because the cost of rent, practice staff salaries and office expenses rose, doctors had slightly less left to pay themselves. Doctors have complained bitterly about being forced to pay themselves less – and even suggested that the GP surgery is facing ‘threat of extinction’. The Royal College of General Practitioners said earlier this year that some surgeries could be forced to close because of smaller budgets. And the British Medical Association has complained that below-inflation pay rises had left doctors with a ‘deep sense of outrage’. More than half of GPs think that their pay is so bad that they are considering early retirement, according to a poll of doctors published in March. Yet when their pay was boosted by 30 per cent a decade ago even some doctors admitted they were surprised by what they had managed to negotiate. In 2007, Dr Simon Fradd, the BMA negotiator who won the deal, said: ‘It was just stunning really. Stunning in that no one in my position had ever believed we could pull it off.’ He had at first thought GPs’ pay would be docked by up to £50,000 if they wanted to opt out of working out of hours. But the Labour government let them reduce their pay by only £6,000 each if they opted not to work the anti-social shifts – and gave them a huge pay increase for their other work. Alex Wild, policy analyst at the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘Patients waiting weeks for appointments because their GP doesn’t open at weekends or out of hours will find these telephone-number salaries particularly galling. ‘GPs are highly qualified professionals and should be compensated as such, but their pay packages have exploded since the disastrous 2004 GP contract, which sees them get paid more to work less. ‘If British GPs’ pay fell in line with that of their counterparts in the likes of France and Australia, we could afford more of them and slash the time it takes to get an appointment.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘General practice is the bedrock of the NHS which is why we’ve increased funding, strengthened proper family doctoring and provided millions more patients with evening and weekend appointments.’","Official figures show thousands of GPs earn more than David Cameron .

"A three-year-old girl is in a 'critical' condition in hospital after being shot in the head by her four-year-old brother, police have said.

In the post that kicked it all off the cafe owner said that she was not 'child-friendly' unless kids were willing to sit at the table without running around the cafe and disrupting other diners. 'If you are looking for a cafe with a children’s menu, baby chinos, a play area, lounges for your children to jump on, vast space for your prams, an area for your children to run rampant, and annoy other customers, whilst you are oblivious to them - then the short answer is no we are not child friendly,' she wrote. A mother herself, the owner stood by her comments in follow up posts declaring her rules had nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with people being respectful. The public declaration came after a customer gave her scathing one-star review, posing the question 'are you child friendly - because it doesn't seem like it'. Jodie responded by saying that the cafe was situated in a prominent business area, and defended her position by stating that as the owner it was ultimately her decision to decide the clientele she wanted to attract. Many people have come out in support of Jodie's decision, praising her honesty . The cafe owner insisted she wasn't discriminating as she has children of her own . Jodie said she was simply within her rights to remind people there's a time and a place for rowdy behaviour . However some people weren't too pleased with the stance, commenting that she should be able to take her kids anywhere . Others said it was excluding people and losing out on much of the market . 'I built the cafe myself. It has my blood sweat and plenty of tears in it. It is beautifully decorated, old fireplaces, French furniture, and we use fine old china etc,' she wrote. 'I have been subjected to children emptying salt and pepper shakers into my fireplaces, parents changing nappies on my lounges, kids grinding their own food into my carpet, parents sitting babies in nappies in the middle of dining tables, kids running around the cafe like it's a formula 1 track, jumping on the furniture, screaming - just for fun - not pain, and encouraged by their parents, upsetting the rest of the customers and I'd really just had enough. 'And yes, I am a mother. A single mother at that. Instead of being a ""burden"" on society, I scrimped every last penny and put it into this cafe, and I'm very proud of it. When I have to stand there and watch people disrespect and damage MY belongings and property, it breaks a piece of my heart every time. 'Some will agree with my stance, some will not, but it's my stance for my business,' Jodie concluded. And despite warnings from critics that defending what some parents called an 'attack' aimed at them would result in damage to the business, the cafe owner revealed that the controversy had the exact opposite effect. The cafe owner revealed in one of her social media posts she 'built the cafe myself. It has my blood sweat and plenty of tears in it' She also said she would welcome children who are well-behaved and won't ruin the place . The decision has sparked a fierce debate leaving vocal parents divided on the issue . Many social media users thought the stance would attract more customers . Some others criticised the parents of disruptive children . This person said they would make a special trip the cafe if they were even in the right state . 'It's definitely positive but there is also those out there that aren't happy .. I've never said no they can't come in I just said they have to be well-behaved ... Parents don't like to be told what to do with their kids.' 'If they came to my house and behaved like that they wouldn't come back so why should they come back to my cafe?,' Jodie told Daily Mail Australia. 'I am a parent, I understand there's a time and a place ... And somewhere where's there's tables and food and hot drinks is not the place.' The comments on her latest Facebook post reflect this, with many people praising her decision to take a stand. Robyn Gibson Borruso wrote: 'It is not a question of being 'child friendly' but more a question of being 'well-behaved child friendly'. I too am a mother of two children and have spent many years teaching my kids how to behave appropriately in restaurants. 'Those parents who jump on their high horse about our 'house rules' are generally those ones who ignore their manic offspring while they disturb everyone else around them. Good on you for taking a stand!!' Some customers jumped to Jodie's defence saying they wished more eateries would take a similar stance . Jodie revealed despite warnings the comments might hurt her business the cafe is booming . This person said not having children was their choice and reveled in the fact there was a place to go . While this user suggested a mass protest against Jodie . Emily agreed commending Jodie's honesty and openness. 'I wish more Cafe's, Restaurants, and places in general took this stance in regards to unruly children and ignorant parents. Good on you! I will be sure to pop in for a coffee next time i'm in that way.' However not all the responses were positive, with young dad Josh Hardes commented saying he would not tolerate being asked to leave if his child was behaving badly. 'I have a 10 month old son and quite often enjoy going to cafes and restaurants with him and my wife. My son may occasionally cry. Or be loud with his toys, but i do not tolerate someone telling me to leave, to keep him quiet, or try moving me to another area. 'I'm there paying for a meal, not your opinion or to be judged by you or your staff. Some kids may be sick, may be having an off day, it may be their first time out in a situation like this so they will be excitable, give the parents the benefit of doubt. 'Or you may just upset the wrong parent one day and the outcome may not be as expected,' Josh wrote.","Owner of The Little French Cafe in Broadmeadow, NSW, penned a controversial post on the eatery's Facebook page on Monday .

"Eden Hazard has scotched talk of a move to Paris Saint-Germain this summer - even though the French champions want Chelsea's main asset.

'If you got to know me you’d know I’m not someone who is disturbed by it,' he said when asked about PSG. 'Every year they say I’m everywhere. It’s part of the job. I focus on the World Cup which is much more important than what is said in the papers.' Hazard will be a key figure for Marc Wilmots' side in Brazil - a further platform to show why he has been such a draw in the Premier League over the last year.

"A mother-of-two who was advised to undergo an NHS gastric bypass to save her fertility was overjoyed to give birth to two sons after she lost ten stone. In total, self-employed nail technician Joanne Cooper, 31, has lost 13 stone since undergoing weightloss surgery on the recommendation of doctors. Miss Cooper, of Rotherham, who is now mother to Noah, three, and Alfie, two, also underwent an NHS-funded tummy tuck operation in June 2013 to remove irritating excess skin. Scroll down for video . New woman: Joanne Cooper, 31, of Rotherham, was advised to undergo an NHS gastric bypass to save her fertility - and she's lost 13st since . She said: 'I was nervous about having a gastric bypass, but I knew it was the only chance I had to have children. 'I thought carefully about it and knew it was the right thing to do, despite the risks.' Miss Cooper saw her weight pile on through a combination of convenience eating and the effects of polycystic ovary syndrome, which she was diagnosed with when she was 16. Before: Miss Cooper, pictured when she was around 23st,  also underwent an NHS-funded tummy tuck operation in June 2013 to remove irritating excess skin and is overjoyed to have two sons . As she was: Joanne saw her weight pile on through a combination of convenience eating and the effects of polycystic ovary syndrome and saw her clothes size hit 28 . She said: 'I only had one period between the age of 12 and 17. When I got the diagnosis of PCOS when I was 16, the weight gain made more sense. 'I did not stuff my face, but did have some bad eating habits. I ate a lot of bad foods - chips, pizza, pasta and takeaways. 'I used to work in a pub, so often had fattening drinks after work, and the only places open for dinner after closing at 2am were late-night takeaways.' Taking shape: She followed the Cambridge Diet in September 2012 and began visiting the gym up to five times a week. She would go on to lose six stone in 10 months, pictured . Healthy diet: She typically ate a protein shake with banana for breakfast, with Quorn chili con carne for lunch, followed by salmon stir fry for evening meals . Happy families: Miss Cooper's perseverance was rewarded firstly when she lost 10 stone in just 18 months, and then, in the spring of 2010, when she fell pregnant with her first son, Noah, now three. Then, within eight months of giving birth to Noah, she fell pregnant with her second son, Alfie, now two . By the time she turned 23, Miss Cooper weighed 23st 7lb and wore size 28 clothing. She said: 'I was down, but put a brave face on. I suffered with back pain and got breathless when walking. I had quite a few health problems. 'I went to the doctor to ask about my future fertility because at the time I was engaged and having children was on the cards. 'I knew it would be a challenge because of the infrequency of my periods, but I was still stunned when the doctor flatly told me that the PCOS, combined with my weight problems, meant it would be practically impossible to conceive. He said a solution would be to have a gastric band. 'Preparing myself for the operation was terrifying.' Miss Cooper underwent surgery in October 2007. She said: 'It took a long time to get used to the change. If I ate anything which I wasn’t ready for, I was sick. It took about six months to start eating properly again.” Despite the challenges, Miss Cooper’s perseverance was rewarded firstly when she lost 10 stone in just 18 months, and then, in the spring of 2010, when she fell pregnant with her first son, Noah, now three. New lease on life: Speaking about her weightloss, she said it has completely transformed her life. 'I would never have been able to keep up with the children when I was bigger. I feel like a completely different, much more confident, person', she said . Tummy tuck: Miss Cooper underwent gastric bypass surgery in October 2007 but she began experiencing unbearable irritation from the excess skin left from her 13 stone weight loss so had a tummy tuck, pictured are the results . Results: She said she was more nervous about having the tummy tuck than about the bypass. Joanne, who showcases the results in this picture, said: 'It was a massive operation. I was under for four hours - they needed to cut vertically as well as horizontally' To her amazement, within eight months of giving birth to Noah, she fell pregnant with her second son, Alfie, now two. She said: “It was a huge relief to know that the plan suggested by the doctors had worked. I was over the moon to have the two boys in my life. 'After having Alfie, I was horrified to see my weight creep up. Having two children so close together meant I really struggled to lose the baby weight. I realised one day that I was back up to 17st. 'I was terrified that I would slip back into the way I was. I’d been through the surgery - I couldn’t let it happen again. I’d been on such a long journey and I felt I was letting myself down. I knew something had to be done.' Miss Cooper started on the Cambridge Diet in September 2012 and began visiting the gym up to five times a week. She would go on to lose six stone in 10 months. Before beginning her weight loss journey, she typically ate a bacon sandwich for breakfast, followed by a chip butty with a bar of chocolate for lunch, with spaghetti bolognese with garlic bread for her evening meal. She would snack on sweets and chocolates throughout the day. Under the weight loss regime, which she continues today, she typically ate a protein shake with banana for breakfast, with Quorn chili con carne for lunch, followed by salmon stir fry for evening meals. She tends not to snack. As her weight reached 10st 7lb, allowing her to fit into size eight clothing, she began experiencing unbearable irritation from the excess skin left from her 13 stone weight loss. She said: 'I was left with a lot of excess skin and was very uncomfortable. Coming down from more than 23st to 10st 7lb came with some serious consequences.' Miss Cooper was approved for an NHS tummy tuck, which she underwent in June 2013. She said: 'I was more nervous about the tummy tuck than I was about the bypass. It was a massive operation. I was under for four hours - they needed to cut vertically as well as horizontally. 'The risks of being under for so long were massive and there were a lot of risks associated with the wounds and scarring. 'Now I’m happy with the way I look. It’s hard to believe, when you put pictures side-by-side, that those old pictures used to be me. 'My life has been completely transformed. I would never have been able to keep up with the children when I was bigger. I feel like a completely different, much more confident, person.' Former self: Joanne said she did have some bad eating habits and ate a lot of  chips, pizza, pasta and takeaways before her operation . Shocked: Joanne says she is finally happy with the way she looks, adding that it's hard to believe, when you put pictures side-by-side, that those old pictures used to be her .

"A newlywed who plans on ending her life after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer says her works towards legalizing doctor assisted suicide - and not children - will be her legacy. Brittany Maynard, 29, of Portland, Oregon, who has stage 4 glioblastoma, released a heartbreaking video last week discussing her desire to die with dignity while also encouraging other states to make the practice of doctor assisted suicide legal. Now, in a new interview, she is responding to critics who are calling her decision selfish, while also explaining how her fight to make it legal for others to die on their own terms will be what she leaves behind when she passes away. Scroll down for videos . Going her own way: Brittany Maynard (above with husband Dan in their wedding photo) plans on ending her life next month after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer . Lasting legacy: Maynard (above) has said that her fight to legalize assisted suicide will be her legacy, and, sadly, not children . Gine to soon: Maynard was diagnosed with the cancer after being married to her husband (above) for just one year . Maynard found out about her condition this spring, and was told by doctors she may only have six months to live. She now plans on taking the pills that will end her life at her home on November 1, just six days after her husband's birthday. Her biggest regret however is that she will never get to have a family. 'I'd say most of my sadness centers around how much I wanted a family,' Maynard told CBS This Morning. 'And it feels like for me, that was always, like, how you created a legacy was, like, through your children. And sort of inadvertently -- through sharing my story, I've realized there's a bit of the legacy I'm creating this way and I'm not ashamed of that. I'm not ashamed to attach my name to what I think is a right that should belong to all terminally ill Americans.' Staying positive: Maynard has made it clear she does not want to die, but rather wants to make sure she goes on her own terms, before she has great pain and is a burden to those around her . Harsh reality: After reviewing Maynard's cancer (above) doctors said she likely had six months to live . The young woman is also making it clear to her detractors that she ultimately does not want to end her life, she just sees no other choice, especially given what her quality of life would be should she fight this diagnosis. 'I don't want to die,"" Maynard explained. 'If anyone wants to hand me, like, a magical cure and save my life so that I can have children with my husband, you know, I will take them up on it.' She then added, 'I think until anyone has walked a mile in my shoes and knows what they're facing and has felt the - like, just bone-splitting headaches that I get sometimes, or the seizures, or the inability to speak, or the moments where I'm looking at my husband's face and I can't think of his name.' Devastated mother: Deborah Ziegler (above), who raised Maynard on her own, told her daughter she would happily attend to her daughter and feed her and change her diapers if she changed her mind . In the same interview, her mother, Deborah Ziegler, who raised Maynard on her own, talks about the discussion she had about her daughter when she learned of her decision. 'Early on, I told her, ""It would be my honor to take care of you, whichever way; if you need to be fed or diapered, it would be my honor,""' she said. 'And that was important for me, for her to know.' Maynard's husband, Dan Diaz, also talked about how sad he is that he will not get to spend the rest of his life with the woman he married just over one year ago. 'That was the original plan, right?' he said. 'But the reality that, I guess, that feeds into the argument of quality of life versus just quantity.' Final farewell: Maynard plans to end her life on November 1, just six days after her husband's birthday . Family and friends: Maynard has said she will die in her own room surrounded by her husband, mother, stepfather and best friend . And Maynard will not see cancer ultimately defeat her, or watch herself lose her quality of life and burden those around her. 'No, cancer is ending my life,' she said. 'I am choosing to end it a little sooner and in a lot less pain and suffering.'","Brittany Maynard, 29, plans on legally ending her life on November 1, before she loses her battle with terminal brain cancer .

"A young girl, rejected by an ancient community, was said to have been buried face down to prevent her spirit from rising from the grave at just 13 years of age. That's the verdict of archaeologists who discovered the child's skeleton near a church in northern Italy. They believe she was considered dangerous in the early part of the Middle Ages, perhaps due to her pale complexion, or because she had a blood disorder that caused her to faint regularly. A young girl, rejected by an ancient community, was said to have been buried (remains pictured) face down to prevent her spirit from rising from the grave at just 13 years old. Experts believe she was considered dangerous in the Middle Ages, perhaps because of her pale complexion or blood disorder . The remains were discovered by a team of archaeologists from the Pontifical Institute of Christian Archaeology at the Vatican, at the complex of San Calocero in Albenga on the Ligurian Riviera,Italy, Discovery reported. The burial ground was abandoned in 1593 and the girl’s remains are estimated to date from the early Middle Ages, but have not yet been radiocarbon dated. Excavation director, Stefano Roascio, explained that so-called 'prone' burials - when people are buried face down - are usually a punishment intended to humiliate the deceased and stop them from rising from the grave. This has led to the Italian media referring to the young girl as a witch - although these claims have not been verified. The remains were discovered by a team of archaeologists from the Pontifical Institute of Christian Archaeology at the Vatican, at the complex of San Calocero in Albenga (marked on the map) on the Ligurian Riviera, Italy . Prone burials are when an individual is buried face-down. Sometimes people were also buried alive looking downwards into the earth. Archaeologists have excavated over 600 bodies buried in this way across the world, and Britain is the hotspot - with over 200 prone burials, Archaeology reported. Caroline Arcini, of Sweden's National Heritage Board conducted a large study to find similarities between prone burials. She found that the earliest known case of prone burial is 26,000 years ago in the Czech Republic, while the most recent is thought to be a First World War grave. Collections of prone graves have been found in Europe - particularly during Roman and Viking periods, in Mexico and El Salvador and in Taiwan. While there are instances where people buried in a prone position were treated normally, some experts think the burial was used as a humiliating punishment. Anthropologist Elena Dellù said: ‘The prone burial was linked to the belief that the soul left the body through the mouth. Burying the dead face-down was a way to prevent the impure soul threatening the living.’ Anthropologist Elena Dellù said: ‘The prone burial was linked to the belief that the soul left the body through the mouth. 'Burying the dead face-down was a way to prevent the impure soul threatening the living.’ The ultimate punishment was being buried alive face-down, but in this instance it seems the girl avoided this fate because of the position of her limbs. They show no signs of struggling or a violent death. Dr Dellù noticed that the skeleton has spongy bone tissue on the skull, likely from severe anaemia. ‘She could have suffered from an inherited blood disorder such as thalassemia or from haemorrhagic conditions. 'More simply, it could have been an diet lacking in iron’ she explained. Thalassemia is a form of inherited blood disorder that originated in the Mediterranean region. It's caused by the weakening of red blood cells and people with the disorder suffer from severe anaemia, bone deformities and heart problems. They also tend to be short, similar to the girl whose skeleton was discovered. It could be that the young girl, who was just 5ft tall, scared her community because of her pale colouring, possible haematomas - the collection of blood outside the blood vessels, usually in liquid form within the tissue - and fainting. The find is particularly unusual because she was buried just in front of a church. Dr Roascio said that a similar burial of a teenage was found in front of a church in Pava near Siena, Italy. Prone burials are relatively unusual. The earliest known burial of this time was done 26,000 years ago and occurred as recently as the last century. Caroline Arcini of Sweden's National Heritage Board believes that prone burials are a deep-seated conscious act that can be seen across different cultures and religions. Spongy bones indicate that the girl may have suffered from an inherited blood disorder such as thalassemia or from haemorrhagic conditions. This might have caused her to faint and be very pale. This could have convinced superstitious locals in the Middle Ages to stay away from her.

"A man sporting two rows of horns implanted into his forehead and a '666' tattoo has been convicted of murdering three men and chopping up their bodies today. Caius Veiovis screamed at the Springfield jury that convicted him Friday, saying: 'I'll see you all in hell every f****** one of you. I'll see you all in hell.' They had considered his case for the past week in Massachusetts. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Caius Veiovis (above) was found guilty of three counts of murder earlier today in a Springfield, Massachusetts courtroom . Victims: Veiovis murdered Robert Chadwell (left), left, Edward Frampton (center), and David Glasser (right) Bad news: Veiovis reacts to hearing the jury's verdicts . Veiovis also was convicted of three counts of kidnapping and three counts of intimidation of a witness in the killings of David Glasser, Edward Frampton and Robert Chadwell. Their remains were buried on private property in Becket. The two other men charged in the killings have already been convicted. Authorities say one of those co-defendants wanted Glasser dead so he couldn't testify against him in another case. The others were killed to eliminate witnesses. The trial was moved from Berkshire County. Veiovis along with Adam Lee Hall and David Chalue kidnapped, killed and dismembered David Glasser, Edward Frampton and Robert Chadwell with the help of an instrument resembling a machete. Caius Veiovis had pleaded not guilty to counts of murder, kidnapping and witness intimidation. Under Massachusetts law, he faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison with no chance for parole following his first-degree murder convictions.. Earlier this month, an employee at the Home Depot in Pittsfield, took the stand as a witness for the prosecution to recount how Veiovis came to the store looking to buy saws. Veiovis (pictured here earlier this month) yelled at the Springfield jury that convicted him Friday, saying: 'I'll see you all in hell every f****** one of you. I'll see you all in hell' Meeting the press: Berkshire District Attorney David F. Capeless (right) speaks to reporters . Veiovis also was convicted of three counts of kidnapping and three counts of intimidation. A witness remembered him buying saws for the grisly murders thanks to his distinctive appearance . Worker William Gregory recalled that even though on August 24, 2011, the store was packed with customers, he was struck by Veiovis' appearance . According to Gregory, Veiovis and a man who accompanied him, Eric Fox, asked him to point them in the direction of saws, which he did. The pair stopped by the aisle where wrenches were being sold before moving on to to the area containing handsaws, hatchets and hammers. Gregory testified that he witnessed Fox pick up a hatchet and pretend to chop something. Eventually, the two men paid for a Starfold wrench set and left. Veiovis served almost seven-and-a-half years in prison in Maine in 1999 for charges including elevated aggravated assault. Then known as Roy Gutfinski, he and his 16-year-old girlfriend cut a teenager’s back with a razor and kissed as they licked the blood. The injury required 32 stitches to close. The Kennebec Journal reported Gutfinski claimed to be a vampire and a Satan worshipper. His name was changed while in prison.","Caius Veiovis yelled at the Springfield jury that convicted him Friday in Massachusetts after four days of deliberations .

"Carl Froch knocked out bitter rival George Groves with a lethal right hand in the eighth round, then set his sights on a title defence in Las Vegas next. There was talk of Froch hanging up his gloves after this hugely anticipated rematch with Groves, but straight after victory – which put to bed any of the question marks from the controversial stoppage of Groves in their last bout – he was already talking of fighting on. 'I'd love to box in Las Vegas,' Froch, 36, declared. 'It ticks a special box for me. I've fought in America a few times but Vegas is the fight capital and it's something I've never done.

'The finish showed why I mix it with the elite and how hard it is to get to that level.' The finish was incredible. Groves was arguably ahead on points in the fight until the eighth round when Froch landed one of the punches of his career. He first padded Groves's right cheek with a left jab then hurled his right fist with unstoppable fury to take the Londoner out. Painful: Froch fought Andre Ward in New Jersey back in 2011 . Groves buckled and his left leg bent awkwardly underneath. The referee did not even need to count him out. 'I had been working on that right hand for three months,' Froch added. 'This was tactical. We had a game plan and it was executed perfectly.' James DeGale is now the mandatory challenger after defeating Brandon Gonzales, but Froch will take a break before deciding who to face next.

"Anyone who has shelled out for an expensive phone lives in fear of dropping it. Now the world's 'most resilient screen protector' has gone on sale, capable of surviving being hit by a hammer. During tests, the transparent screen, which is the same thickness as three pieces of paper, also remained undamaged when dropped while walking on tarmac, bricks and concrete, its manufacturer claims. Called Rhino Shield, the protector is made from a custom-formulated polymer and can absorb five times the impact energy of Gorilla Glass - the glass currently used on iPhone and Samsung screens, for example. Scroll down for video . The Rhino Shield screen protector, pictured here on the iPhone 5, costs £17.99 and can absorb up to five times the force of Gorilla Glass, currently used on iPhones and other phones. During tests it was also able to withstand being dropped on bricks and tarmac . Even a 255g steel ball dropping from 48cm failed to scratch the screen and left the phone 'fully usable.' Made by Cambridge-based Evolutive Labs, the sheet can be fitted to the iPhone 5, 5S and 5C and does not affect the touchscreen's sensitivity. The screen comes with a self-adhesive silicone back and as the user wipes a cloth along the front of the film, it clings to the phone's screen, but can be removed if necessary. Its makers claim the Rhino Shield leaves 'no sticky residue or air bubbles' and uses what's called an oleophobic coating that makes it 'smudge proof'; meaning fingerprints don't stick to it. An iPhone 4 version of the scratch resistant screen will be available soon, with other models expected in the future. Rhino Shield was funded by a Kickstarter campaign that ended in March this year and it is now on sale from Firebox for £17.99. The makers explained on the campaign page: 'Protecting mobile devices have been a big challenge. The Rhino Shield sheet, pictured, is the same thickness as three pieces of paper, around 0.029cm, and has a 95 per cent transparency rating. Its makers Evolutive Labs claim that it doesn't affect the phone's touchscreen . The Rhino Shield also comes with an oleophobic coating making it resistant to smudges and fingerprints . 'There are many great cases that already tackle some of the problems with outstanding solutions and we have seen some protection at insane levels, i.e. cases that enable smart devices to survive when a car runs over it. 'However, there are very few products that attempt to protect the most vulnerable part of the phone - its screen. 'Therefore we were determined to design and engineer a screen protector that will be resistant to impacts. After a year of relentless research and development, the end product is Rhino Shield.' The phone protector goes on sale as SquareTrade, a provider of protection plans for gadgets, tested five smartphones, including Apple's new iPhones, to see if they could withstand drops, dunks and other common hazards. Its found that while the iPhone 5C and 5S scored similar on the 'Breakability' scale, the latest models aren't as durable as last year's iPhone 5. The biggest loser, however, was Samsung's Galaxy S4, which failed to work after being submerged in water and being dropped 5 feet off the ground, according to San Francisco-based SquareTrade. The phone that withstood SquareTrade's torture test best was Google's Moto X. New research by SquareTrade reveals that the iPhone 5s & 5c were outshone by their predecessor, the iPhone 5, and the Samsung Galaxy S4.","The transparent Rhino Shield protector is as thick as three sheets of paper .

"Edward Putman, 47, was convicted of raping a 17-year-old girl in 1993, and is now planning to build a 30-bedroom hotel next to the M25 . A convicted rapist who won almost £5million on the Lottery is planning to build a 30-bedroom hotel next to one of Britain’s busiest motorways. Edward Putman, 47, who was jailed for breaking into a house and twice raping a 17-year-old girl, submitted an official planning notice for a budget motel at the site in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire. His plans, which were refused by Three Rivers Council last month, include demolishing the £600,000 house and outbuildings he bought with his lottery winnings and converting them into a hotel off the M25. Putman served four years of his seven year sentence for rape in 1993 before scooping £4.5million when his numbers came up in September 2009. He had intended to keep his win a secret by requesting anonymity from National Lottery operators Camelot, who were unaware of his previous convictions. But his past came to light when it was revealed that he had carried on claiming £15,000 in income support and housing benefits following the win. Doubts were raised after council officers became suspicious when he tried to buy his former one-bed council flat in Hemel Hempstead with £83,000 cash. He admitted two counts of benefit fraud and was sentenced to nine months in prison in 2012. Now released, the benefit cheat is said to have invested in a ‘wealth management’ finance scheme and the hotel is his latest project. Despite having his proposals turned down by the local authority, Putman has hired a property developer to draw up detailed plans and continue pursuing the scheme. Richard Wyndham-Smith of FJ Thompson in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, told the Sunday Mirror: ‘There was a lot of support from it from local people so it’s something we have got to balance the whole thing up and make a decision on. ‘The whole thing is that the current use of the site is something that a lot of the resident’s don’t want.’ Mr Wyndham-Smith added that a decision to appeal or submit a fresh plan was currently being considered. The property was granted planning permission for second-hand motors to be sold and serviced at the site in 2005 – six years before Putman is believed to have moved in. However, it is not understood whether he currently operates a business from the site. Many locals are said to be ‘horrified’ by the plans, and one told the Sunday newspaper: ‘Putman’s the last person who should have anything to do with owning a hotel.’ And Mike Sibley, Crime Prevention Design Advisor from Hertfordshire Constabulary, said: ‘I am rather concerned with the drive through underground car park. ‘The car park could also be a magnet for antisocial behaviour particularly in bad weather and could become a youth shelter with associated problems.’ Putman's £600,000 home in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, that he bought with his lottery winnings and now wants to demolish in order to create a budget hotel . The plans (pictured), which were submitted to Three Rivers Council, show the proposed elevations of the build . The proposals include 30-bedrooms across two floors and a dining room, kitchen and an office beside M25 . While Lib Dem Councillor, Joy Mann, has backed the plans stating that as a commercial business it is ‘an excellent idea’. She said: ‘The immediate area is an industrial site with some very prestigious international businesses based there. ‘A motel would bring the kind of jobs to the area that we need especially skills for our young people. It would be good for local business as guests would be using local facilities.’ It is not known whether Cllr Mann knew about his previous convictions – which also include witness intimidation and perverting the course of justice - when she submitted the comments to the council. Putman has also been convicted of wounding with intent in a case from the mid-1980s, after a neighbour was stabbed in the stomach, while friends claim he has appeared in court for other offences including burglary. Putman, pictured left after he served four years of seven year rape sentence, and his ex-partner Gail, right . After his rape conviction was revealed, his ex-partner Gail Vincent, 53, waived her right to anonymity and described how he had put a six-inch knife to her throat and raped her as well. Ms Vincent, with whom he has a 28-year-old son, Sam, only learned of his lottery win when she was contacted by the Daily Mail in 2012. She said: ‘He paid less than £200 in maintenance in 12 years, although seven or eight of those he was in prison. Putman leaving St Alban's Magistrates' Court in July 2012 where he admitted two counts of benefit fraud . ‘I can’t begin to tell you what I think about his win. He should give the money back or pay compensation.’ She also claims that he burnt alive her children’s pet rabbit and guinea pig and pushed her down the stairs while she was eight months pregnant. She told a newspaper: ‘I was petrified of him. He was like a ticking time bomb – you never knew when he’d go off.’ Ms Vincent, who lives in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, made a rape allegation against him in 1998 but later withdrew it after claiming she was pressurised by his associates. The former support worker, who stayed with Putman for 15 years, was jailed for 28 days for perverting the course of justice. Her daughter from another relationship, claimed her Putman was a violent alcoholic who sexually abused her by making her undress in front of him. She also alleged he threatened her brother and mother with a kitchen knife. She said: ‘Eddy comes across as a charmer but he is really a Jekyll and Hyde character. He’s won millions and it couldn’t have happened to a less deserving person. He is an absolute monster.’ While his victim, who was a teenager at the time of the rape and cannot be named for legal reasons, spoke out after his lottery win saying she 'would like to see him penniless'. ‘He is a brazen psychopath who told everyone what he had done when he went to prison. There was no remorse, no shame,' she said.","Edward Putman, 47, was jailed for twice raping a 17-year-old girl in 1993 .

"This is the dramatic moment Palestinians threw rocks and flares at Israeli police after Islam's third holiest site was raided by officers who say it was being used to plan a riot. Israeli police came under a barrage of missiles in clashes in Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque compound yesterday, with four protesters were arrested. The site in Jerusalem's walled Old City has seen repeated disturbances over the years over what Palestinians say are fears of an Israeli threat to the site, which Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary. Israel denies any such threat. Jews also revere the site as the location of two destroyed Biblical-era temples. Scroll down for video . Flares: Israeli police came under a barrage of missiles as they stormed Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque compound. Four Palestinian protesters were arrested . Blast: Palestinians threw rocks and flares at Israeli police after Islam's third holiest site - Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque - was raided by officers who say it was being used to plan a riot . Going in: Israeli police enter the compound after apparently receiving information that protesters planned to start a riot and disrupt visits there. There were no reports of injuries or other incidents . Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said officers went to the elevated compound, also known as Temple Mount by Jews, after receiving information that protesters had planned to start a riot and disrupt visits there. '(Officers) surprised the rioters, pushing them back and found petrol bombs, rocks, stones, bottles at the scene that would have been used to attack visitors ... It was a police initiative to prevent disturbances,' Rosenfeld said. Palestinians holed up in the mosque threw projectiles at police with riot shields outside as they removed a makeshift obstruction of barbed wire and planks before sealing off the building with the protesters inside, police video showed. Tensions subsided later in the day and several protesters remained inside the 11th-century, grey-domed mosque as night fell, fearing they would be identified and arrested if they exited, a police spokeswoman said. There were no reports of injuries or other incidents, and no specific reason was given for the protest. Fight: Palestinians holed up in the mosque threw projectiles at police armed with riot shields. Officers removed a makeshift obstruction of barbed wire and planks before sealing off the building with the protesters inside . Barricade: Palestinians inside the mosque blocked off an entrance with barbed wire and used furniture, including a large book cabinet, to stop officers getting inside . Clashes: The site in Jerusalem's walled Old City has seen repeated disturbances over the years over what Palestinians say are fears of an Israeli threat to the site, which Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary . Aftermath: Tensions subsided later in the day and several protesters remained inside the 11th-century, grey-domed mosque as night fell, fearing they would be identified and arrested if they exited . Palestinians have long been wary of visits by non-Muslims to the compound and while tourists do visit periodically, Israel bars orthodox Jews from praying there for fear of exacerbating tensions. The compound, which includes the 7th-century, golden-hued Dome of the Rock, overlooks Jerusalem's Western Wall, revered by Jews as a remnant of Herod's Second Temple. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied on Monday that there were any moves afoot to restrict Muslims' access to the compound and blamed 'Palestinian extremists' for the violence. 'Palestinian extremists [are] instigating violence through incitement ..., false and baseless rumours that (Israel is) threatening the Muslim holy places and nothing could be further from the truth,' he said after meeting United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in Jerusalem. 'I am committed and Israel is committed to maintaining the status quo exactly as it has been for many decades.' A visit in 2000 to the site by then-Israeli right-wing opposition leader Ariel Sharon after U.S.-brokered peace talks broke down was followed by a five-year-long Palestinian uprising.","Israeli police came under barrage of missiles  in Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque .

"The fiancée of the doctor being treated for Ebola in a New York hospital has said she and her husband-to-be are 'OK', while she and two friends are set to be released from hospital quarantine. Morgan Dixon, 30, told a friend that she and Craig Spencer, 33, a doctor who was fighting Ebola in Guinea when he contracted the disease himself, were doing well. The pair are currently at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, where Dr Spencer was rushed into isolation Thursday night after testing positive for the deadly virus. ''OK': Morgan Dixon, left, fiancée of Ebola-stricken Dr Craig Spencer, right, has said the two of them are 'OK' in isolation . To be wed: The couple, set to marry next Fall, were both checked in to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan on Thursday . Couple: Dixon, 30, is a charity worker in New York City, while Dr Spencer works for Doctors Without Borders, and had just finished a stint fighting Ebola in Guinea . Two friends of the couple who went bowling with them in Williamsburg this week have been quarantined with Dixon as a precaution - but are set to be moved from the hospital to their homes later today, the New York Times reported. There they will still be under quarantine but away from the secure ward where Dr Spencer is being treated. Dixon and Spencer live together on West 147th Street in Harlem. A friend of Dixon, whom she spoke to by phone yesterday, said her first reaction to the threat of Ebola entering her life was to be grateful that they were in America, where the best treatment is available. Shavla Wise, a longtime friend, told the Times: 'She literally was like, ""This is amazing, being in a privileged position in a well-resourced country."" She was also thinking about the folks over there who he left behind.' Epicenter: Dr Spencer is being treated in a secure ward in Bellevue Hospital, midtown Manhattan . She also revealed that while Dr Spencer was still in Guinea, working for the organization Doctors Without Borders, Dixon had joked about what she might do if her fiancé came back with the disease. Her worst fears were realized after Dr Spencer returned from Guinea on October 17, where he had been treating Ebola victims for a month. He came back to their home in Harlem and felt fine for days, before developing fatigue and a fever of 100.3 degrees, prompting him to call for medical help. In the time between his arrival in the U.S. and being taken to hospital, Dr Spencer went for a three-mile jog, ate at a meatball restaurant in Greenwich Village, rode several subway lines and went bowling in Williamsburg. Happy couple: Dr Spencer and Miss Dixon met in China while attending Henan University in 2007. The wife-to-be is currently in quarantine as a precaution . Route: How Dr Craig Spencer traveled Manhattan before his diagnosis . City leaders including New York mayor Bill de Blasio and state governor Andrew Cuomo yesterday reassured New Yorkers that they are not at risk of catching the disease, despite Spencer's travels through the city. Spencer and Dixon, who met on a language-learning course in China, are due to marry next Fall. Friends described Dr Spencer as a 'goofball', who is nonetheless a gifted medical practitioner with a flair for languages. Dixon, who works at the HOPE Program, a New York charity, has been described by friends as 'liberal and earthy.' Her colleagues posted a statement yesterday saying: 'Our thoughts and concerns are with our colleague and her fiancé at this time. 'We have spoken with high-level officials at the New York City Department of Health and have been assured that there is no risk at our workplace.' Shalva said that even from inside the hospital, Dixon was texting her details of an event they planned to go to tonight so she doesn't miss out.

Around 2:00 PM, he went to pick up Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm share at 143rd St and Amsterdam Avenue (Corbin Hill Farm) and picked up a box which he took to his apartment. At around 5:30 PM, Dr Spencer left for The Gutter bowling alley in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with two friends. For his arrival at Gutter, he took the A train at 145th Street and transferred at 14th Street and took the L train to Bedford Avenue. Around 8:30 PM, Dr Spencer left The Gutter.

"Former DJ: Ray Teret (above) arrives at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court yesterday . A woman who claims Jimmy Savile raped her after a disco in the 1960s told a court yesterday how she cut her hair short afterwards because of her disgust that he had touched it. Savile commented on the 15-year-old’s ‘lovely’ hair and started to ‘stroke’ it after fellow DJ Ray Teret had taken her to a flat, a court heard. But before the teenager had the chance to explain that she had straightened it by ironing it with brown paper, Savile raped her, she told police more than 50 years later. She alleged that she was also raped by Teret, now 73 and on trial for a series of sex offences, after which she claims he told her ‘you should be thanking us’ for taking her virginity. Now in her 60s, she told his trial that she had short hair in a photograph taken a few weeks later because of what Savile had done. ‘I cut it off because he touched it,’ she told the jury. The next day she told her grandmother, who tried to track down the two DJs, she said. The woman found Teret at a club and ‘battered’ him, afterwards apparently telling her granddaughter: ‘He won’t be doing that to anyone else.’ Teret, who made his name on pirate station Radio Caroline and is on trial with two other men, is accused of attacking 17 young girls over 35 years. Yesterday the jury at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester was played the police video interview of the woman who claims that in 1963 or 64 she met Teret at an alcohol-free disco in Salford. The DJ – then in his early-20s – claimed he was 17 and asked to take her home, she said. Instead he drove her in his bubble car to a nearby flat where Savile – already a successful DJ – was waiting. ‘I couldn’t believe it,’ she said, thinking ‘Oh my God’ and that she couldn’t wait to tell her friends. Savile gave her Lucozade and told her to sit on the bed, she told detectives, but after admiring her hair he abruptly pushed his hand up her skirt and raped her. Afterwards, she said, Teret also raped her. He allegedly made a disparaging comment about her losing her virginity and gave her money to catch a bus home, but she threw it away. Feeling what had happened was ‘my fault’, she kept quiet for more than 50 years, even after other women made similar allegations against Teret. But seeing him on television leaving court brought it all back, she said, and she told her family, who contacted police. Cross-examined by Nicholas Johnson, defending Teret, she denied that his client had not been involved, telling the barrister: ‘You wasn’t there. Nobody knew other than my gran and Ray Teret and Jimmy Savile.’ Together: Teret (right) followed Jimmy Savile (left) around in his nightclub 'like a shadow', a court heard today . Earlier, a woman who claims Teret raped her when she was a 15 or 16-year-old in 1963 or 1964 told how the DJ used to ‘make eyes’ at her at a youth disco. She arranged to meet him in Manchester one afternoon, expecting to be taken on a date, but instead he led her to a small room in a dingy building furnished with only a bed where he raped her, she said. Terrified and much smaller than him, she felt unable to scream or resist, she said. ‘I just lay there like some kind of stupid fool and let him do what he wanted,’ she said. She also came forward after seeing press coverage of Teret leaving court, describing her reaction as: ‘Oh my God, he’s still alive.’ Another woman, aged 15 at the time, told detectives she was taken from a disco to a flat by Teret (above) Cross-examined by Mr Johnson, she said she first encountered him DJ-ing with Savile. ‘He was following him around like a shadow,’ she said. Teret, of Altrincham, denies 34 sexual offences including 18 rapes. Alan Ledger, 63, from Altrincham, denies a serious sexual assault, two indecent assaults and one count of indecency with a child. William Harper, 66, of Stretford, denies one count of attempted rape. The trial continues. DJ accused of sexually abusing 17 girls 'followed Jimmy Savile around in his nightclub like a shadow' Two other men are also on trial with Teret: William Harper, 65, denies one count of attempted rape . A former DJ accused of sexually abusing 17 girls across four decades followed Jimmy Savile around in his nightclub ‘like a shadow’, a court heard yesterday. One of Ray Teret's alleged victims said she first met the defendant in the early 1960s when he was working at Jimmy Savile's Disc Club in the Higher Broughton area of Salford, Greater Manchester. ‘Eccentric’ Savile was the ‘star of the show’ but Teret, 72, of Altrincham, took top billing when she met him again at a club in Manchester city centre called Beat City. She told detectives she was aged 15 or 16 when Teret arranged to meet her outside the club, a jury at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court was told. He led her to a nearby flat, took her straight to a bedroom and then raped and sexually assaulted her, she alleges. Speaking to police in a video interview played to the court she said she had no sexual experience at the time while Teret was ‘like some sort of celebrity’. Describing the alleged incident, she said: ‘He was like on top of me, I was sort of squirming. I couldn't say I was saying no. I didn't know what he was doing. I just laid there like some sort of stupid fool.’ She said at one point he said to her: ‘I do things like this to special people.’ When asked by the interviewer why she had come forward to the police, she said: ‘It has been on my mind for a long time. It's always in the back of my mind. ‘When the Savile case cropped up I really did think to myself “why don't you get that Ray Teret up” because he is just as bad as him.’ She rang the police in October last year after seeing Teret on television after he had been already been charged with sexual offences. ‘I put the news on and I seen him,’ she said. ‘I thought “he is still alive, he just does not deserve a life, he has got his come-uppance now”.’ She said she would rather tell a stranger about her experience than her family, who she still has not told. Giving evidence via videolink, she told Nicholas Johnson, defending Teret, that she had not seen anything ‘sexual going on’ at Savile's club in Higher Broughton which she visited two or three times and she thought was a teenage disco for under-16s. Mr Johnson said to her: ‘Mr Savile was a bit of celebrity at the time, wasn't he?’ She replied: ‘He was like an eccentric I would have said. He was just a DJ at the time.’ The woman said at first she was 'excited' and 'could not wait' to tell her friend that she had met Savile (above) The barrister asked her: ‘Mr Teret, you saw him at the Jimmy Savile Disc Club?’ The witness said: ‘Yes.’ Mr Johnson continued: ‘He was not the star of the show at that stage.’ The witness replied: ‘No, it was Jimmy Savile.’ Mr Johnson said: ‘He, in effect, was helping Jimmy Savile?’ The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, replied: ‘He was following him around like a shadow.’ She said she ‘instantly recognised’ Teret when she saw him at Beat City, formerly known as The Three Fountains, in 1963 or 1964. Mr Johnson asked: ‘How did you know his name?’ She replied: ‘It was posted on the bill on the door outside.’ The witness explained she could not remember when Teret asked to meet her outside Beat City one afternoon but she said she did not tell her friends. She said: ‘It was like a secret. He said ""don't tell anybody"".’ Mr Johnson said: ‘Are you suggesting that he swore you to secrecy?’ The witness said: ‘I am not suggesting that. He said ""don't tell your friends"" and I didn't.’ Mr Johnson asked: ‘Why not?’ She said: ‘Well I didn't want to tell anybody.’ Mr Johnson said: ‘What did you think you were meeting him for?’ She said: ‘To go on a date.’ ‘What were you expecting to happen on the date?’ asked the barrister. The woman said: ‘Go for a coffee, go to the cinema but that never happened.’ Mr Johnson said: ‘The fact is that none of the events you describe did happen?’ She replied: ‘I'm not having that. It did happen. He did it. I have lived with it for 50 years. That is the truth and that is what happened.’ Mr Johnson said: ‘Why did you walk back to the club with him?’ She said: ‘Don't ask me. I don't know. I was like a zombie. I was so shocked at what he had done to me.’ Teret, who worked at pirate station Radio Caroline and Manchester's Piccadilly Radio, denies 18 rapes, two other serious sexual assaults, one attempted rape, 11 indecent assaults and two counts of indecency with a child. Two other men are also on trial with Teret. Alan Ledger, 62, from Altrincham, denies a serious sexual assault, two indecent assaults and one count of indecency with a child. William Harper, 65, of Stretford, denies one count of attempted rape. The trial continues.

"Bolivia's socialist president romped home to a third term in elections yesterday, dedicating his win to Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro and all 'anti-capitalist leaders'. Thousands of people poured onto the streets of La Paz in celebration after Evo Morales declared victory, flocking to the presidential palace to catch a glimpse of Bolivia's first indigenous president. Exit polls showed the former coca farmer re-elected on more than 60 per cent of the vote, some 40 points ahead of his nearest rival, giving him a strong mandate to expand his left-wing policies. Scroll down for video . 'Triumph of the anti-colonialists': Bolivian president Evo Morales, centre, with his vice president Alvaro Garcia Linera, left, and foreign minister David Choquehuanca, right, celebrate at the Government Palace in La Paz . Joy: Hundreds of supporters wave flags, including ones bearing the image of communist revolutionary Che Guevara, and cheer as they celebrate Morales's win in the Plaza Murillo, across from the Presidential Palace . Landslide: Exit polls showed Morales, a former coca farmer, re-elected on more than 60 per cent of the vote, some 40 points ahead of his nearest rival, giving him a strong mandate to expand his left-wing policies . Their man: An Aymara indigenous woman burns incense in celebration as supporters wait for President Morales outside the presidential palace in La Paz, after news broke that he had likely won a third term . Morales's Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) was meanwhile on track to win 111 out of 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 25 of the 36 seats up for grabs in the Senate, according to the exit polls. 'This is the triumph of the anti-colonialists and anti-imperialists,' boomed Morales, 54, who has aligned himself with Cuba, Venezuela and Iran and has an antagonistic relationship with the U.S. and other rich countries. 'We are going to keep growing and we are going to continue the process of economic liberation.' To roars of approval, he dedicated victory to Cuban leader Fidel Castro, late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez and all 'anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist' leaders. Official results were delayed but pollsters Ipsos and Equipos Mori said Morales had triumphed a whopping 40 points ahead of wealthy cement magnate Samuel Doria Medina, his nearest rival. The win will extend his time in office to 14 years, until January 2020, after Bolivia's Supreme Court ruled last year his first term was exempt re-election limits imposed as part of a new constitution in 2009. That will make him Bolivia's longest-serving leader consecutively in office, eclipsing 19th century Marshal Andres de Santa Cruz, a founder of the republic in power from 1829-1839. Party: Bolivian national and indigenous flags fly from the Government Palace as team Evo celebrate their win . First indigenous president: Morales speaks to supporters last night.

Aymara indigenous and other supporters cheer President Morales as he speaks  from the palace balcony . Supporters of Morales in Cochabamba, central Bolivia, take to the streets to celebrate his victory . Known abroad for his anti-imperialist and socialist rhetoric, the 55-year-old coca growers' union leader is popular at home for widely redistributing Bolivia's natural gas and mineral wealth among the masses. A boom in commodities prices increased export revenues nine-fold and under Morales' watch Bolivia accumulated record international reserves and sold bonds abroad for the first time in nearly a century. Economic growth has averaged 5 percent annually, well above the regional average, helping the government lift half a million Bolivians out of poverty since Morales took office in 2006. Political analyst Reymi Ferreira of Gabriel Rene Moreno University in Santa Cruz called Morales's landslide 'a recognition of the government's management and of the fact the opposition never presented a vision for the country.' But critics claimed he spent tens of millions in government money on his campaign, giving him an unfair advantage, while others accusing him of silencing critical media by letting government allies buy them out. Posters bearing the slogan 'With Evo, we're doing well' blanketed La Paz on election day, far out-shining the opposition's propaganda, which was conspicuously absent. Popular support: Women sell flowers next to a pro-Evo Morales mural in La Paz, the Bolivian capital . Big country: A sign in support of Morales stands next to an empty road in the high planes near Lake Titikaka . Democracy: Voters line up to vote at a polling station in the village of Laja, 36 km west of La Paz, high in the Andean plateau, over 4,000 meters above sea level. Voting is compulsory in Bolivia . Aymara indigenous people cast their vote at a polling station in Patamanta, Bolivia . Morales has capitalised on his everyman image while consolidating state control over Bolivia's institutions, nationalising key utilities and renegotiating natural gas contracts to secure more profit for the government. But his success has proved double-edged. Morales has alienated environmentalists and many former indigenous allies by promoting mining - a cornerstone of Bolivia's economic boom - and planning jungle highway that will slice through an indigenous reserve. And despite Bolivia's economic advancements, it is still South America's poorest country. Nearly one in four Bolivians live on $2 a day, according to the World Bank. The Associated Press cites analysts as saying Bolivia depends too much on natural resources and is especially susceptible to the current easing in commodities demand from China. Nevertheless, 'El Evo', as he's affectionately known, is here to stay for at least six more years. In a sign of his broad base of support Morales won eight of Bolivia's nine states, including the former opposition stronghold of Santa Cruz, an agribusiness center in the eastern lowlands where he polled 51 percent, according to Ipsos. Santa Cruz student Sonia Tika summed up the president's popularity. 'I voted for Evo because he's done good things - built roads, given us computers, food stamps. Everything the people asks for, he gives,' she said. People sit at the coca leaf market in Villa 14 de Septiembre, in the Chapare region, Bolivia . Election delegates count votes at a polling station in La Paz . Some six million people were registered to cast ballots in the presidential and congressional polls in Bolivia, where voting is compulsory. The economic and political stability Morales has presided over are welcome in Bolivia, which has suffered numerous coups since independence in 1825 and still struggles with deep poverty despite the recent boom. Morales, a member of the Aymara ethnic group, has also used nationalist, anti-capitalist rhetoric to fire up popular support. He has argued vociferously against the U.S.-led campaign targeting coca farming, which Washington brands a drug-trafficking activity because of the leaf's use in cocaine. Peru's former drug czar, Ricardo Soberon, estimates the annual revenues of Bolivia's coca farming industry at $2.3billion, equal to about 7 per cent of gross domestic product. Many Bolivians chew coca leaves or brew them as a tea, and Morales has argued it is part of the country's cultural heritage. But the U.S. considers Bolivia uncooperative in its war on drugs. In 2008, Morales kicked the US Drug Enforcement Agency out of the country, along with the American ambassador, accusing them of conspiring against his government. Last year he threw out the U.S. Agency for International Development.","Evo Morales re-elected with more than 60 per cent of the vote .

"When Amer Deghayes graduated from a college in Brighton with a qualification in business studies  this summer, he had his whole future ahead of him. Rather than start a career, he chose to follow in his father's footsteps and travel to Syria in order to had out aid to the needy. But once inside the country he quickly joined forces with the al-Nusra Front, and al-Queda linked group fighting against the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Amer Deghayes (centre, in grey) was the first of his family to leave for Syria, telling his parents he wanted to be an aid worker. Brother Abdullah (front left) and Jaffar (front right) followed soon after . Worse still, his brothers Abdullah, then 18 and due to start a University course in his home-town, and Jaffar, 17, followed after him. Their mother, Einas Abulsayen, said that the two younger boys left without warning, after the youngest tricked her into thinking he needed his passport for ID at school. She said just before leaving Jaffar asked her for a cuddle. She didn't realise she was holding her son for what could prove to be the last time. On the way to the airport, the boys met up with long-term family friend Ibrahim Kamara, 19, who had stolen his 15-year-old brother's passport before going to join them. Despite being unaccompanied by an adult, all three are believed to have caught a flight from Luton airport to Turkey, where they found their way into Syria. Abubaker Deghayes went to see his three sons several times in the next few months in several unsuccessful attempts to persuade them to come home. He insists that during this time he believed the boys were still working for aid charities, but in April, he came face to face with the truth. While Amer had once been an intelligent college student, earning a qualification in business studies, once in Syria he joined the al-Nusra Front, an al-Queda affiliated group fighting Bashar al-Assad . Amer's father travelled  to see his sons, who refused to come home and insisted they were working with aid charities. But in April he learned the truth when Amer called to say Abdullah had been killed by a Syrian sniper . His eldest son Amer, called to say his younger brother Abdullah had been killed by a Syrian army sniper in Kassab. Mr Deghayes said: 'Amer told me Abdullah advanced into territory of the Syrian army then a sniper shot him in the chest. He fell on the ground and looked at the sky and laughed. 'You feel he died a good death as a Muslim. As a martyr, he goes to paradise. But at the same time you feel sad for the loss.' Then, last week, Mrs Kamara also got a call from Amer. Over Skype he explained that Ibrahim had also been killed, this time by one of the first U.S. airstrikes in Syria after his compound was hit. The three brothers were joined by another Brighton student, Ibrahim Kamara, 19, who stole his 15-year-old brother's passport before flying from Luton airport to fight in Syria . His mother Kadiatu Kamara (pictured) also recieved a call from Amer last week to say her son had been killed in one of the first U.S. airstrikes in Syria, which hit a compound he was in . He explained that Ibrahim, who  was the going by the name of Khalil al-Britani, had recorded a message on his phone for his family in case he died, but the phone had been destroyed. With airstrikes intensifying, and fighting in Syria growing fiercer by the day, the Deghayes family fear they will never see their remaining two sons again. In part, they blame British authorities for telling teenage jihadis that they will face prosecution if they return to the UK. Mr Deghayes believes there should be an amnesty to allow his boys to come home. Both parents insist that their sons are not 'terrorists', merely selfless boys who travelled to Syria to 'help defend those who are weak.' Around 400 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria over the last two years, authorities believe, with an estimated 20 having died. The Deghayes' parents insist their boys are not terrorists, and simply went to Syria to protect the weak. They now fear they will never see their two remaining sons again . Those who have died include Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, who is believed to have driven a lorry to a jail in Aleppo before detonating a bomb in February. The married father of three, who was born and raised in Crawley, West Sussex, left Britain in 2013, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria. Photographs were also published in January of two British brothers, named in reports as Akra and Mohamed Sebah from north London, who were believed to have died in battle in the war-torn country in September.","Amer Deghayes left college in Brighton to fight for Syrian rebels in January .

"Susan James, 44, was found hanged after police took six hours to respond to a 999 call from her home where the line mysteriously cut out . A charity worker was found hanged after police took six hours to respond to a 999 call from her home where the line mysteriously cut out. The body of Susan James, 44, was found by a police officer sent to her home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, after she rang the emergency number but did not say anything. A post-mortem examination carried out on the businesswoman's body found that she died from hanging and police said they were not treating her death as suspicious. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating why it took so long for Thames Valley Police to send an officer  following the mystery drop out call on September 13. IPCC Associate Commissioner Guido Liguori said: 'My condolences go out to Susan's family and friends for their loss. 'Our investigation will consider the force's response to the call including the circumstances surrounding the delay in police attending the house. 'We are just looking at the call handling aspect of it. 'We are looking at what happened between the call being made at midnight and the officers going to the address at 6am. 'We need to find out what happened during that period - was there a delay and what were the reasons for that and what information did they have and what did they do with it?' Ms James worked as a finance manager at the Chiltern MS Centre, a charity providing support for people with multiple sclerosis based in Wendover, near Aylesbury. At her funeral, the charity's chief executive, Robert Breakwell, described her as 'vibrant and full of life.' Mr Breakwell said of her death: 'People's reactions quickly turned to disbelief, shock and deep sadness for the loss of someone so young. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating why it took so long for Thames Valley Police to send an officer to the home in Dixon Close, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire . 'Every single person from the MS Centre will have been helped by Susan in some way. 'We all loved having Susan around. We are missing her and we will continue to miss her. 'We respected her dedication, hard work and commitment and it was a privilege to have known and worked with her. 'We won't forget Susan and we will treasure the fun times and the happy memories that she gave to us all.' An inquest was opened and adjourned into Ms James' death, but a date for the full hearing was yet to be set. A police spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police has referred its handling of an unexplained death to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. 'The referral is in relation to an incident in the early hours of September 13. 'A 44-year-old woman died at a residential property in Aylesbury.

"Dr Abraham Borbor, the deputy chief medical doctor at the country's largest hospital in Monrovia, had been among three Liberians - and the first Africans - who received the drug, ZMapp. Officials in the country confirmed today he had lost his battle with Ebola . A Liberian doctor who was among three Africans to receive an experimental Ebola drug has died, it was announced today. Dr Abraham Borbor, the deputy chief medical doctor at the country's largest hospital in Monrovia, had been among three Liberians - and the first Africans - who received the drug, ZMapp. He worked at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in the country's capital. Initial reports suggested all three recipients of the drug had responded well after receiving the drug on August 13. But Dr Borbor yesterday took a turn for the worse, the country's . Information Minister Lewis Brown told The Associated Press. Two Americans, Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol, received the untested drug and survived. But . a Spanish missionary infected with Ebola died after receiving the . treatment - and there has been no update on the two other Liberians who . took doses of it. Ebola . has killed more than 1,400 people across West Africa. There is no . proven vaccine or cure for the disease that can cause a grisly death . with bleeding from the eyes, mouth and ears. The virus can only be . transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the sick or . from touching victims' bodies, leaving doctors and other health care . workers most vulnerable to contracting it. The first British victim, nurse William Pooley, is now being treated in an isolation unit in London's Royal Free Hospital. The 29-year-old had selflessly . volunteered to serve in a makeshift clinic in Sierra Leone where other nurses had died . from Ebola or were too scared to come into work. Mr . Pooley last night arrived back to London after being airlifted in an . isolation sack for treatment at the north London hospital. Last night the NHS started a global hunt for remaining supplies of the only treatment thought to combat the virus - ZMapp. The drug had never been tested on humans, although an early version had been found to work in some ebola-infected monkeys. It is aimed at boosting the immune system's efforts to fight the disease. Only five people in the . world are known to have received the drug and Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the American company behind it, says stocks are exhausted. It is expected to be months before more can be . produced by its U.S. maker. Health experts caution that the drug had never been tested in humans before and it was unclear whether it works. They also say there is a huge . gap between the treatment the two Americans got at an Atlanta hospital, . where five infectious disease experts and 21 nurses provided rigorous . care, and West Africa, where even such basics as sterile fluids can be . in short supply. Earlier today, Japanese officials said they were ready to provide an anti-flu drug as a potential treatment to the deadly disease. A Liberian army soldier assigned to the Ebola Task Force enforces a quarantine in Dolo Town, Liberia. The government issued a quarantine notice four days ago after several residents in the town - near Liberia's international airport Monrovia, fell ill with Ebola, which today claimed the life of the lkocal hospital's deputy chief medical director, Dr Abraham Borbor . The Dolo Town Church of Christ stands abandoned on a Sunday more than a month after dozens of its congregation died with Ebola symptoms. To date, the disease has killed more than 1,400 people across West Africa . There is no proven vaccine or cure for the Ebola, which causes bleeding from the eyes, mouth and ears.  The virus can only be transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the sick or from touching victims' bodies, leaving doctors and other health care workers most vulnerable to contracting it. In rural Dolo Town, residents are relying on food donations . Experimental serum ZMapp was created from a combination of antibodies in January. Until the drug was given to the American Ebola sufferers, it had only been tested on monkeys. It is unclear exactly how it works but both Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol recovered from Ebola after receiving the serum. It is only available in limited supplies as larger scale human testing is needed to prove it safe and effective. The companies behind the drug, ZMapp and Kentucky BioProcessing are currently working to have the product approved and the production accelerated. The companies said in a statement: 'It is important to note that the emergency use of an experimental medicine is a highly unusual situation. 'As a consequence global high-level discussions concerning the policy, ethical, and medical implications of this exceptional situation have been initiated.' Chief . cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan may respond to emergency . individual requests for the favipiravir tablet, before any official . decision by the World Health Organisation. The . drug, developed by a subsidiary of Fujifilm Holdings to treat novel and . re-emerging influenza viruses, was approved by the Japanese health . ministry in March. It is available at any time, at the request of WHO, officials said today. ZMapp, . an untested drug only ever used on a handful of patients, has shown . promising results, apparently aiding the recovery of two U.S. missionaries who contracted the virus. A . source at the Department of Health said: 'We are working with our . international partners to source remaining doses for the patient.' The WHO said earlier this month that it is ethical to use untested drugs on ebola patients given the magnitude of the outbreak. Fujifilm . spokesman Takao Aoki said ebola and influenza viruses are the same type . and theoretically similar effects can be expected on Ebola. He . said the drug has also proved effective in lab experiments on mice. Fujifilm said it has favipiravir stock for more than 20,000 patients. The company is also in talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on clinical testing of the drug in treating Ebola. Favipiravir is one of only a few drugs that may work on ebola. Several drugs are . being developed for ebola treatment. But they are still in early stages . and there is no proven treatment or vaccine for the highly fatal . disease, and Fujifilm's drug is one of only a few new drugs that may . work on ebola. Favipiravir . inhibits viral gene replication within infected cells to prevent . propagation, while conventional ones are designed to inhibit the release . of new viral particles to prevent the spread of infection, the company . said. Mr . Pooley is the only Briton to be have ever been infected by ebola . outside the laboratory. The only other British case was in 1976, when . scientist Geoffrey Platt pricked himself with a needle contaminated with . the virus. Dolo residents washing with chlorine water while lining up to receive a ration of nine cups of rice. Critics argue there is a huge gap between the treatment the two Americans got at an Atlanta hospital, where five infectious disease experts and 21 nurses provided rigorous care, and West Africa, where even such basics as sterile fluids can be in short supply . A Liberian army soldier assigned to the Ebola Task Force enforces a quarantine in Dolo Town . A Liberian Ministry of Health worker checks people for Ebola symptoms at a checkpoint near the international airport. The disease has claimed more lives in Liberia than any other country . Health officials . last night said Mr Pooley was 'not seriously unwell' – a factor which . will significantly boost his chance of survival. Most patients die of . ebola because of dehydration, when their blood vessels break down and . their major organs fail. But . fit, young patients who are given quick treatment have a vastly . improved chance of survival. If they are hydrated and the bleeding . controlled, their immune systems can in some cases kick in, and defeat . the virus. The WHO has put the number of people infected with the deadly ebola virus at 2,615. Some 1,427 have died since the disease was identified in Guinea in March, before spreading to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Male nurse William Pooley, 29, was airlifted back to London after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone . Rigorous . quarantine measures are used to stop the spread of ebola, as well as . high standards of hygiene for anyone who might come into contact with . sufferers. Symptoms of the virus appear as a sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This . is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver . function and, in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. The effects of the disease normally appear between two and 21 days after infection. It is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through person-to-person transmission. The . WHO said the disease can be passed between people by direct contact - . through broken skin or mucous membranes - with the blood, secretions, . organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and indirect contact . with environments contaminated with such fluids. The . Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issued updated travel advice last . week which urged people to carefully assess their need to travel to . Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. 'General . medical facilities throughout Sierra Leone are currently under severe . strain due to the Ebola outbreak, and unable to provide the same . standard of healthcare as in the UK. 'Dedicated healthcare facilities for Ebola are overwhelmed,' the FCO warned. The . Sierra Leone parliament has voted to pass a new law which means anyone . caught hiding an Ebola patient can receive prison terms of up to two . years. Some 910 cases have . been recorded in the country - and 392 deaths - but the WHO believes the . magnitude of the outbreak has been underestimated because people are . hiding infected friends and family in their homes. The . WHO reported that corpses are being buried in rural villages without . notifying health officials and with no investigation of the cause of . death. In . some instances epidemiologists have travelled to villages and counted . the number of fresh graves as a rough estimate of suspected cases.","Dr Abraham Borbor was given drug on August 13 along with two others and 'responded well'

"Young students at an elite private school have been terrorised by older boys who woke them in the middle of the night and dragged them from their dorm rooms as part of a traumatic hazing ritual. The principal of King's College in Auckland, NZ, said he was going to look 'deeply' into the incident which saw students walked through the grounds of the school with pillow cases over their heads in the early hours of the morning. The scarring ceremony was carried out by six Year 12 students, who marched the students around one of the boarding houses at 3.30am last Thursday, Stuff.co.nz reported. During the ordeal a 'prank' was apparently played, where the older boys hit themselves while another student yelled out - designed to scare the younger students into thinking some of their peers were being tortured. Michael Leach, Principal of King's College in Auckland, New Zealand is looking into a cruel hazing incident which happened last week . Another student - in Year 13 - is said to have hit one of the younger boys on the back of the legs during the horrible event. The house master was made aware of the incident almost immediately after it happened, when other students reported it. All seven of the perpetrators have been suspended for the time being and will face a meeting with the school's disciplinary board in coming days. One parent told of the torture his son went through at the $37,000 a year school, who along with his peers was screaming in fear while totally disoriented. 'Apparently the idea was to scare them,' he told the website. Students were marched through the boarding house with pillowcases over their heads before they were further terrorised . 'But as you can imagine the young boys were disoriented, they couldn't see anything. 'They thought they were going to be beaten up.' The school's principal Michael Leach has only been in the top job for a few weeks, but said he would take a strong stance against the hazing ceremony, adding he had not heard of any similar occurrences at the college. Leach said 'Bullying can't be tolerated in any form' and empathised with parents who were upset by the incident. He also revealed that no formal complaints had been made by any parents as of yet, and that counselling would be offered to all the young students involved. All the victims were also being interviewed about what happened during the night, and all families of the Year 9 students had been notified.","Students at the King's College in Auckland, New Zealand were terrorised .

"Dallas billionaire Samuel Wyly has filed . for bankruptcy protection, saying he does not have the money to pay the . nearly $400million in penalties for hiding stock holdings aboard, . Mr Wyly filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in federal district court in Dallas Sunday. The one-time owner of the Michaels arts-and-crafts empire has said that his biggest liabilities are to the IRS — the amount is unknown — and $198million to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 'Poor' billionaire: Businessman Sam Wyly, seen here in this July 2001 photograph, has filed for bankruptcy protection, saying he does not have the money to pay thenearly $400million in penalties . Wyly, 80, pictured left and right with his third wife, 52-year-old Cheryl Wyly, has been found liable for engaging in a 13-year fraud involving offshore accounts . In documents filed with a US bankruptcy court in Dallas, Wyly said he had between $100million and $500million . of both assets and liabilities and cited the 'massive costs' of . fighting civil claims from the SEC as the reason for seeking bankruptcy protection. Last month, US District Judge Shira Scheindlin in New York . ordered Wyly and the estate of his late brother Charles to surrender up to $400million after a civil jury found that they had engaged in a 13-year fraud that involved creating a web of offshore trusts and subsidiaries. The SEC has since said the total, including interest, should . be $299.4million, not counting $100million in legal fees, which is one of the largest awards ever . sought from individual defendants in a US court. Wyly, 80, appeared on Forbes' list of the 400 richest . Americans in 2010 at No. 385, with a net worth of $1billion. The businessman is married to his third wife, 52-year-old Cheryl Johnson, and has six grown children from his first two marriages. The couple reside in a palatial $6.5million home featuring five bedrooms, five bathrooms and an outdoor pool in the wealthy Dallas suburb of Highland Park. Robert Gemmill, a spokesman for Wyly, said he would not . comment beyond the bankruptcy filing. An SEC spokesman declined . to comment. Creative: The Wyly brothers sold their arts and crafts chain Michaels in 2006 for $6million . Michaels Stores Inc. offers arts, crafts, scrapbooking, floral, framing, home decor, seasonal offerings, and children's hobbies, as well as provides photo frames . US Bankruptcy Judge Barbara Houser scheduled an initial . hearing for Wednesday. The SEC accused the Wyly brothers of constructing a complex . system of trusts in the Isle of Man that netted them $553million in untaxed profits through more than a decade of hidden . trades in four companies they controlled. Those companies included Sterling Software Inc, Michaels . Stores Inc, Sterling Commerce Inc and Scottish Annuity . & Life Holdings Ltd, now Scottish Re Group Ltd. They sold Sterling Software for $4billion just before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, and Michaels Stores was offloaded in 2006 for $6billion. The SEC said that the brothers used proceeds from secret sales of stock in their companies to buy ranches and condominiums around Aspen, Colorado; a horse farm near Dallas; art and jewelry. Charles Wyly was killed in a car crash in 2011 when his Porsche was struck by an SUV in Aspen, Colorado. His estate was . substituted as a defendant in the fraud case. The SEC and the Wylys have been fighting over whether the . securities regulator may collect money still held in the . offshore trusts. Lawyers for the Wylys have argued that those assets, worth . about $380million, are controlled by the trusts' beneficiaries, . including the Wylys' children. In a court filing last week, the SEC said the trusts' assets . are the property of Sam and Charles Wyly. Palatial: Wyly and his third wife live in this $6.5million home featuring five bedrooms and a pool in the wealthy Dallas suburb of Highland Park . In good company: Sam Wyly, right, pictured in August 2010 seated next to CNN founder Ted Turner on day 2 of the Americans Renewable Energy Day . 'The SEC continues to believe that Sam and the estate of . Charles Wyly have sufficient global assets to pay any judgment,' the filing said. A lawyer for Sam Wyly, Steven Shepard, warned Scheindlin in . August that a massive judgment would bankrupt his client. It was not immediately clear whether the bankruptcy filing . could allow Wyly to reduce his debt to the SEC.","Samuel Wyly, 80, has been found liable for engaging in a 13-year fraud involving offshore accounts .

"Sentenced: Janice Muriel Yost, 78, from Oregon has been jailed for two years and nine months after she stole money from her 98-year-old aunt . A 78-year-old woman has been jailed after stealing from her 98-year-old aunt and fleeing to Arizona three times to avoid court appearances. Janice Muriel Yost from Oregon had power of attorney for her aunt after she hospitalized in 2008. While in control of her possessions, she sold some of her aunt's jewelry and other items and pocketed the money. She also raided her bank account, cashed in a $25,000 certificate of deposit and went on to spend the stolen funds on restaurants, hotels and travel. According to Oregon Live, she finally ended up in court after she was extradited for the third time. After she was sentenced to two years and nine months in jail at Clackamas County Court in Oregon City, the aunt sat in her wheelchair and watched as Yost was taken away to the cells in handcuffs. Prosecutor Stacey Borgman told the court: 'This woman, at her age, has caused more problems for the justice system than a 25-year-old. 'This case has been going on for five years.' Borgman added that Yost had tried to delay the case 'on the hope that it would never be resolved,' hinting that she hoped to outlive her aunt . When the aunt first found out about the theft, Yost moved to Arizona. However a short time later she turned herself in and was ordered not to leave Oregon. Despite the order, Yost fled again and failed to show up to a court hearing in 2011. She was extradited in 2013 but subsequently did not appear at her trial and returned to Arizona. Yost was then convicted of aggravated theft and criminal mistreatment and was sentenced to 21 months in prison. The judge allowed her to turn herself in at the Clackamas County Jail, but she failed to show up/ . Instead she drove a rental car to the Portland, Oregon, airport, removed an electronic monitoring device from her ankle and flew to Arizona. Witness: After she was sentenced to two years and nine months in jail at Clackamas County Court in Oregon City, the aunt sat in her wheelchair and watched as Yost was taken away to the cells in handcuffs .

"Andrew Flintoff, looking lean and bowling quickly, was back training with Lancashire at Headingley on Tuesday, five years after his retirement. Flintoff, 36, joined in all the drills before the third day of their Roses match against Yorkshire and bowled off his full run-up. He could even come back, as first revealed in The Mail on Sunday, in Twenty20 this week against Durham and Birmingham, but Lancashire still want him to play a second team game first.

Putting his back into it: Flintoff will play a 2nd XI game for Lancashire next week and will then play in the T20s . Returning hero: Flintoff's comeback was first revealed by Sportsmail . Jimmy Anderson said of a comeback for . his England and Lancashire colleague: ‘I would be in favour, of course, . if he was fit and bowling well. 'With someone who has been out of the game for so long, the issue would be fitness and getting up to match intensity.’ Flintoff, . whose return had been delayed by an ankle injury suffered in fielding . practice two weeks ago, may play for the second-string side against . Glamorgan next week. And . if that goes well, he would have an appetising target to aim for — . Lancashire’s Roses NatWest Twenty20 Blast game against Yorkshire at Old . Trafford on June 6.

"A German backpacker was allegedly lured to a rural property in Queensland and drugged, tied up and raped in a Wolf Creek-style attack. Queensland police will allege the 20-year-old tourist answered an online job advertisement for a nanny based in the Stanthorpe area, near the Queensland-NSW border. She caught a night bus to the area on August 13, 2013, and was picked up by a man who drove her around for about an hour. Actor John Jarratt plays Mick Taylor in the film Wolf Creek. A 47-year-old Brisbane man allegedly lured a backpacker to a rural property in Queensland and drugged, tied up and raped her in a Wolf Creek-style attack . Police say the Brisbane man drugged the young woman with chocolate laced with the sedative zolpidem, which is sold under the brand name Stilnox, before taking her to a shed on a property 30km southwest of Stanthorpe. The woman claims that when she woke up she was cable tied to a bed. She said she was fed more chocolate and when she next woke up, at 1am on August 14, she was outside by the side of the road. The terrified woman called her sister in Germany before managing to make her way to a property at Spring Creek where she was found at 7am that same day. Details of the alleged kidnapping emerged after a 47-year-old Brisbane man was charged with a string of offences including kidnapping, rape, stupefying in order to commit an offence and deprivation of liberty. Queensland police will allege the 20-year-old tourist answered an online job advertisement for a nanny based in the Stanthorpe area, near the Queensland-NSW border . He was refused bail in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Tuesday. The court heard the man, a cleaner, was on bail for other charges when he was arrested on Monday. Defence lawyer Nathan Hounsell said his client should be granted bail because the evidence was circumstantial and he'd never failed to front court before. However, Magistrate Linda Bradford-Morgan said that after reading a police affidavit objecting to the man's bail she was satisfied there was a strong case against him. 'I am of the view that there is an unacceptable risk of reoffending or failing to appear if (he is) placed on bail,' she said. The case was adjourned until November 24. Outside court Mr Hounsell said his client would strongly contest the charges. 'He is clearly devastated at the refusal of bail however until the matters are finished he will remain in custody,' he told reporters.","German backpacker allegedly lured to rural Queensland property and raped .

"Last year, the then drugs minister Jeremy Browne flew to Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, South Korea and the US and Canada . Full details of how Lib Dem ministers spent almost £40,000 of taxpayers’ money flying around the world on a drugs fact-finding ‘Magical Mystery Tour’ can be revealed today. The report was published this week to criticism after it concluded that the UK’s tough laws do not work and that legalising deadly narcotics would not lead to more use. Details of the project – uncovered by the Daily Mail using Freedom of Information laws – show a Lib Dem minister and a team of officials spent thousands on business class fares and stays in luxury hotels . They also bought wine and chocolate from the hotel mini-bar while dining and drinking, leaving tips on Government credit cards. Officially, the project was titled ‘Drugs: International Comparators Study’, but in the Home Office it became witheringly known as the ‘Magical Mystery Tour’. Last year, the then drugs minister Jeremy Browne flew to Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, South Korea and the US and Canada. After he was sacked in a reshuffle, his successor Norman Baker finished the project with visits to Switzerland and the Czech Republic. Details of the spending – opposed by the Tories – prompted critics to question why the information could not have been gathered by the phone or using the internet. Mr Browne was accompanied to Portugal by two Lib Dem spin doctors, and in every other country by at least two Home Office officials, significantly increasing the cost. They stayed at the Dom Pedro Palace Hotel in Lisbon, which offers ‘elegant guest accommodations’. The Lib Dems' 'magical mystery tour' included two nights' stay in Lisbon (file picture, right) He told Parliament he had decided not to go to New Zealand because he was ‘mindful of the cost’. After he was installed as Crime Prevention Minister, Mr Baker used video conferencing this year to gather information on Uruguay, Colorado and New Zealand. The Lib Dems declined to comment, saying only the report was Home Office-commissioned. A Home Office spokesman insisted: ‘We look at drugs policies in other countries.’ Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘At a time when the Government is telling us to tighten our belts we have to ensure that every trip abroad is worth it.’ After Mr Browne was sacked in a reshuffle, his successor Norman Baker (above) finished the project with visits to Switzerland and the Czech Republic .","Last year, then drugs minister Jeremy Browne flew to Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, South Korea and US and Canada .

"The parents of a 12-year-old girl who was brutally stabbed 19 times by  classmates hoping to impress the fictional character Slender Man have come forward for the first time. Appearing on camera in an interview with ABC's 20/20, which will air in full on Friday, the unidentified parents described the heart-wrenching moment they saw their daughter in hospital after she was stabbed and left for dead in a park in Waukesha, Wisconsin in late May. 'She was as pale as a ghost,' the girl's mother told ABC News' David Muir. 'She was terrified, she was crying, she couldn't breathe.' Devastated: The parents of the 12-year-old girl who was stabbed 19 times and left for dead in a Wisconsin park in May have spoken out on camera for the first time in an interview with ABC, which will air on Friday . Heartbroken: The girl's mother described her shock at seeing her daughter in hospital for the first time . She went on: 'She saw me and she put her hand out and I hugged her and I told her, ""you're going to be OK, it's going to be fine"". But I could see that she was covered in stab wounds.' Looking over the wounds to her daughter's body, she counted five on her arm and seven on her leg. 'I heard one nurse say, ""I count 19"",' the mother said. Despite the wounds, their daughter battled through, telling her parents: 'I wanted to live.' 'She's an amazing child,' her mother said, while her father added: 'She's definitely our hero.' Fighter: The little girl, pictured with ABC News reporter David Muir, will also appear on the show. She spent six weeks in the hospital after she was stabbed multiple times over her arms, legs and abdomen . Survivor: The girl, pictured on a stretcher, managed to crawl out of the woods and alert a passing cyclist . The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009. The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit. The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia. It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport. It is understood to have originated in a photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009. It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'. The little girl will also appear in the interview on 20/20 on Friday at 10pm. She has not been identified or previously pictured, apart from an image showing her being carried away on a stretcher. Her attackers, Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12, have since been charged as adults for first-degree intentional homicide but questions remain over whether they will be competent to stand trial. Weier and Geyser told investigators they stabbed the girl to impress Slender Man, a tall, fictional bogeyman popular on the Internet that they insisted was real, according to a criminal complaint. In an official police report Weier said Slender Man is the 'leader' of Creepypasta, and she needed to kill to show their loyalty. She explained Geyser told her they needed to slaughter their friend  to become 'proxies' of Slender Man and gain access to his mansion, which they believed was located inside northern Wisconsin's Nicolet National Forest. They planned to kill the victim and then walk to the mansion. Geyser was allowed to have two friends over for her birthday, and she and Weier planned the murder for that Friday night. Arrests: Anissa Weir, left, and Morgan Geyser, right, allegedly stabbed the girl after inviting her over for a sleepover. They had wanted to impress a fictional horror character, Slender Man, with the killing . In court: Weier is pictured in court in June, but doctors have deemed she is not competent to stand trial . Charged: Weier, also charged as an adult, is undergoing competency tests to determine if she can stand trial . But they changed their plans and they decided to kill her in a bathroom at a nearby park the next morning. Weier told police she knew there was a drain in the floor for the blood to go down. When they left for the park the next morning, Geyser hid the knife tucked away in her waistband. They planned to play hide and seek with the victim and then kill her when they were out of sight, in the trees. It was in the seclusion of the woods that one of the girls held down the victim while the other frantically stabbed their friend 19 times. Weier said that the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood. 'Obsessed': Slender Man, left, is a popular online character who abducts children. Right, before the stabbing, Geyser's father proudly shared this image that his daughter had drawn of the character on a menu . Despite her numerous wounds, she was able to crawl out of the woods and to safety where a bicyclist found her and called 911. The victim spent six days in the hospital. The two young suspects were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack. Geyser and Weier face up to 60 years in prison if convicted as adults of attempted homicide. They could be incarcerated to age 25 if they are convicted as juveniles under state law. Two doctors concluded that Geyser was mentally incompetent to stand trial and Weier is currently undergoing competency tests, which must be completed by mid-October.

"A mother-of-two who struggled to run for just two minutes as a size 20 two years ago has now dropped several dress sizes and done the Great North Run. Lisa Hanrahan, 34, from Hartburn, once hated exercise as she loathed gyms, but since joining a running group she works out four times a week - and she's gone from a size 20 to a 12. The finance professional began running with Eaglescliffe Running Group in January 2013, after realising she was struggling to keep up with her two young sons. Lisa Hanrahan pictured before she joined the group in late 2012 (l) and recently (r) Lisa, who lives with husband Fergus and sons Caden, eight, and Finnan, three, said: 'I hadn't done any running since school and I'd never done the distance I can do now. 'I've struggled with my weight since before I had my first child. 'I wasn't fit in any way and when I realised I was finding it hard to run around with my children I knew I had to do something about it. 'I joined a couple of gyms but never went more than a few times and didn't enjoy it at all.' But then she learned about the group run by Kelly Francis. 'She starts you off really slowly - a two-minute run then a walk - and when I started I struggled even with that. But Kelly's really encouraging and I did feel like I was progressing each week so I stuck with it. 'Once I saw some improvements, it made me more determined so I watched what I ate, and I do some of Kelly's other classes now as well.' Lisa  (left) took up running two years ago and lost weight under the guidance of Kelly Francis (right) Kelly and Eaglescliffe Running Group have helped motivate Lisa to exercise four times a week . Breakfast: Big bowl of cereal . Lunch: Shop bought sandwich and crisps . Dinner: Large portion of barbecue chicken with lots of potatoes . Snacks: Coffee with sugar full fat milk . Breakfast: Scrambled eggs on toast . Lunch: Pasta or salad with vegetables, chicken and cous cous . Dinner: Salmon with greens and new potatoes . Snacks: Coffee with skimmed milk . Lisa started in ERG's beginners' group with the aim of becoming fitter. Since then she has become a keen runnner, dropping four dress sizes and three stone, going from 15st 4lbs to 12st 4lbs. Lisa hopes to get to 11st . 'I'd love to lose another stone and hover around the 11st mark. I'm not so much focussed on my weight; rather on inches and fitness,' says Lisa. 'My eating habits haven't changed that much - thought I started having skimmed milk in my coffees and reduced my portion sizes at dinner. I also stopped having cereals for breakfast because of their sugar content - and despite having a big bowl in the morning I was always starving come noon. 'I will never set foot in a gym, but I exercise a lot. 'I go to the running group on a Monday and on a Tuesday I do Kelly's kettlebells class and on Wednesday I lead my own group running. On a Friday I do Kelly's metafit class - a programme on a CD.' This year, Lisa's taken part in 5k and 10k events regularly and was delighted to complete the Great North Run. The route starts in Newcastle, then takes in the iconic Tyne Bridge, passes by the famous Gateshead International Stadium, and finishes in the coastal town of South Shields. Lisa's now trained with UK Athletics to lead her own ERG class of beginners and intermediate runners as a qualified instructor. She said: 'When I signed up for the Great North Run I thought I would only do it once. 'It was the furthest I've done and it was incredibly hard work training for it. 'But I think I might do it again. It's the feeling when you complete a challenge like that, there's nothing like it. 'I just love that I can run around with my children now and taking the running groups is going really well. If I can do it, anyone can.","Lisa Hanrahan, 34, from Hartburn, once hated exercise .

"Breast cancer is often thought to affect only women, but a husband and wife each diagnosed with the disease have been fighting it together. Gerard Campion, 63, of Clinton, Connecticut, was diagnosed with male breast cancer after discovering a blister on his chest in 2006 - sadly the cancer had already spread to three lymph nodes. 'I remember thinking, he's not supposed to have this. I am,' his wife, Meg Campion, told the Today show, recalling the devastating diagnosis that came three years before she faced her own battle with breast cancer. Scroll down for video . Fighting together: Gerard Campion, of Clinton, Connecticut (left) was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006, and his wife Meg (right) battled the disease three years later . Fortunately, she caught the disease at an early stage. 'Everything was in sight, meaning it had not traveled to any lymph nodes,' said Mrs Campion, who was pronounced cancer-free after a lumpectomy and radiation. After undergoing surgery to have his right breast removed, followed by four chemotherapy treatments, Mr Campion was also declared free of the disease. Family ties: Mr Campion (center) was diagnosed with the disease again in 2011 but his condition remains 'manageable' and he was able to run a 5K race in Connecticut Sunday, cheered on by his wife and daughters (pictured) But in 2011, the father-of-two and grandfather was diagnosed with recurrent breast cancer and learned that the disease had spread to his spine, ribs and hips. 'The cancer's at some point going to get me. And it's going to take a while to get me because I ain't gonna let it get there,' said Mr Campion, who was told by doctors that his cancer was manageable but not curable. Last year, he told the New Haven Register that his condition had stabilized after two rounds of radiation and hormone treatment. Determined: 'The cancer's at some point going to get me.

"Abuse: A spokesman for German Chancellor Angel Merkel called the images repulsive and shocking . Police are investigating suspected abuse of refugees at a German asylum centre after an image appearing to show a guard standing on a handcuffed inmate's head was found on an officer's phone. The German government has condemned the suspected cases of abuse against refugees in which asylum-seekers were maltreated by security guards and even forced to lie in a bed filled with vomit. Angela Merkel's spokesman said pictures published in German media appearing to show private security guards abusing refugees in North Rhine-Westphalia state were repulsive and shocking. Rights groups also criticised the apparent abuses, which evoked the violations by American guards at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq that emerged in 2004. Authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia are investigating six security guards. Steffan Seibert - Merkel's spokesman - said Germany would not tolerate such abominable behaviour. 'If what is in the pictures is confirmed, that the refugees are indeed being abused and humiliated, it would be a most repulsive act,' Seibert told a news conference in Berlin. In one picture a security guard appears to step on the head of a handcuffed refugee lying on the floor at a refugee centre while another picture apparently shows a 20-year-old refugee from Algeria being forced to get into a bed covered with vomit. In a video, the refugee is heard to ask why the guard wants to torture him by forcing him into the vomit-filled bed. 'A good Christian turns the other cheek,' the guard tells him. Germany, partly due to its Nazi past, is one of the world's leading destinations for people fleeing oppression and war. It had the largest number of new asylum claims among industrialised nations in the first half of 2014 - 65,700, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 'Germany is a humane country that holds human rights in high high regard,' Seibert said. The government is confident the investigation by local authorities will be conducted thoroughly and quickly, he added. 'Everyone is shocked when they see pictures like this and wants to know what happened,' he said when asked if Germany's reputation had been damaged. 'If what the pictures suggest really happened then those responsible have to be held accountable.' Location: The alleged abuse took place at this home for asylum seekers in Burbach near the western German town of Siegen. The converted army barracks is currently under investigation over the incident . An asylum seeker walks across the grounds of former Siegerland barracks in Burbach. Rights groups have criticised the apparent abuses, which evoked the violations by U.S guards at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq . Guenter Burkhard, director of the 'Pro Asyl' lobby group, said it was appalling to think that what appear to be right-wing extremists could be hired by private security firms without proper background checks. 'It's a shock to think that people who came to Germany to escape repression are then tortured here by private security guards,' he said. 'There's something wrong when people with right-wing ideologies are turned loose on refugees.' Maria Scharlau, an official at Amnesty International in Germany, said it was 'an appalling abuse of power when people assigned to protect the refugees end up maltreating them.' Local authorities said the security guards faced charges of bodily harm. They have interviewed about 96 of the 700 refugees at the centres in the western state where the guards were stationed. The private firm handling security was fired. 'We will not tolerate any violence against those seeking asylum,' said the state's interior minister Ralf Jaeger. 'Anyone who threatens or abuses anyone in such a dire position must face severe punishment.' Authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia are investigating six security guards at the refugee camp in Burbach . Investigation: Police have interviewed about 96 of the 700 refugees at the centres where the guards were stationed - including this converted barracks in Burbach. The private firm handling security was fired . The German government said that the number of refugees through the first eight months of the year was up to 99,592 - an increase of 60 percent from the year earlier period. About 20 percent of those applications were from Syrian refugees. The next largest groups of refugees came from Serbia, Eritrea and Afghanistan. On top of the 99,592 are another 20,000 injured or ill refugees from Syria. The increase is one of the factors that may have helped a new right-leaning party, the Alternative for Germany, at the polls as it won more than 10 percent of the vote in three eastern state elections in the last month.","Images appear to show private security guards abusing asylum seekers .

"Rory . McIlroy has kept his mobile phone switched off and given his laptop . away. 'It's like I have been living in the seventies these last few . days,' he said. In his first round since his bombshell split from his fiancee Caroline . Wozniacki, he kept the surprises coming by shooting in the sixties - a . four under par 68 to be precise in the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth . on Thursday. Boost: Rory McIlroy celebrates chipping in for an eagle during first round of the BMW PGA Championship . Lift: McIlroy is congratulated by Ernie Els after holing his second shot on the seventh hole for an eagle . Caroline Wozniacki will head into French Open action nursing a broken heart and a dodgy left knee. Rory McIlroy’s ex-fiancee has had knee trouble for a while. She tweeted: ‘It’s a hard time for me right now. Thanks for all the sweet messages! Happy I support Liverpool right now because I know I’ll never walk alone.’ It still left him some distance behind the leader Thomas Bjorn, who . shot an astounding 62, but this was some effort, given all the . circumstances. 'Everyone . know what it feels like,' said the 25 year old. 'It's tough. You're not . sleeping and I'm not comfortable standing here talking about it. But . the object now is to bury my head in my golf and for the most part I did . a pretty good job of that.' He . certainly did, from the moment he had stood in the middle of the . seventh fairway with his arms aloft and his face bathed in smiles. Amazing what a holed wedge shot from 130 yards for an eagle two can do . to lift the spirits of a man. Centre of attention: All eyes were on Rory McIlroy at Wentworth after he split up from Caroline Wozniacki . One to watch: Spectators surrounded the third green to get a look at McIlroy in his opening round . 'Wear black for Mac' was the theme of the opening day  – the players . were paying their respects to the popular caddie Iain McGregor, who died . doing the job he loved in Madeira recently – and suddenly, the . predominant mood of this particular Mac was anything but black. How . he seized on that enormous slice of good fortune. His approach had . actually pitched 35ft beyond the flag before spinning back into the . hole. Five . holes later he almost came up with an even more spectacular blow, as . his five iron approach from 203 yards to the par five 12th finished . three inches away. It was certainly a much better shot. 'I've . not had an albatoss,' he said. 'It would have been nice if it had gone . in, since it's the one thing in golf my dad still has on me. He's had . one.' Those . two eagles took McIlroy to four under and on the leaderboard. He might . be struggling with commitment off the course but there was no doubting . his commitment to capitalise and return a morale-boosting score. Out in front: Thomas Bjorn leads the tournament after shooting a stunning 62 in his first round . Pin-point accuracy: This approach to the 18th set up a birdie for Bjorn - the eighth of a stunning opening round . Thomas reigns in the rain: The umbrellas were up as Bjorn holed out to complete his first round . After . all his problems here since the controversial changes were instigated . in 2010 – he's not finished in the top 20 since  – wouldn't it be ironic . if this was the year he won the European tour's flagship event? Not . that he's thinking that way just yet, of course. 'My golf is good enough . but right now I' d still be happy simply being around for the weekend,' he said. A . sense of black humour was needed at the start. Itching for the relative . quiet of a round inside the ropes, what happened when he got the hoopla . of the opening hole out of the way? The siren blew heralding a . suspension of play owing to some electrical activity in the area. The . heavy showers that punctuated the day's proceedings actually helped . McIlroy when he got back out, softening the greens and turning it into a . target golf test. No-one prospered quite like Europe's renaissance man, . Bjorn. In . a game where perfection isn't possible it's hardly surprising players . invariably finish even great rounds thinking it could still have been . one or two shots better. Not Bjorn on this day.

"The Caribbean is known for its magnificent beaches. But with the recession, the waves of good fortune that generally lap its shores became crashing breakers as the financial storm blew harder. Anguilla suffered more than most. It's not the easiest island to get to, and it's not cheap, so the visitors drained away. Investment soaked away into the sand, leaving developments marooned, some half-built, on the beaches. But though Anguilla lost its mojo for a while, there's no doubt it's still a special place - certainly to judge by some of the visitors who have stuck by it, including Paul McCartney, Denzel Washington , Liam Neeson and Kelly Osbourne. The heart-stopping waters and white sands of Anguilla are coming back into vogue . Walking through the soft sand of Meads Bay in Anguilla, in the British West Indies, is an aerobic workout . Of course beaches themselves are not affected by recession. And after 25 years of research - exhaustive research, you understand - lying prone on towels and loungers, counting grains of sand, I'd say that Anguilla has the finest beaches and sea in the Caribbean. You can get the idea with an early morning walk on a near-deserted strand. A gentle stroll? Not in Anguilla. In places the sand along the mile-and-a-half stretch of Meads Bay is so deep that walking becomes aerobic exercise. And the waves there are mesmerisingly beautiful - they swell into glassy green, their vertical faces marbling momentarily as they catch the sun, and then furl and crash. On top of the bluff at one end of Meads Bay is Malliouhana, one of the Caribbean's loveliest hotels, which will re-open next month under the flag of Auberge Resorts from California.

Celebrities such as Beyonce and Sir Paul McCartney have stuck by Anguilla through its rough period . At the other end sits the outsize Viceroy (with an unfeasible 300 rooms on an island just 16 miles long), which has attracted an LA crowd, and sometimes offers good deals. For something more sympathetic and self-contained, there's Carimar, or the lovely Meads Bay Cottages. On the south coast, Cap Juluca, set on the heart-stoppingly pretty Maunday's Bay, and Cuisinart on Rendezvous Bay, roll on. And that's not to forget Anguilla's villas, some of the finest in the islands. After breaking the mould in the mid-1990s as the island's first 'supervilla', Cerulean has returned completely restored. Cap Juluca is set on the heart-stoppingly pretty Maunday's Bay . A guest enjoys a massage outside under perfect blue skies at Cap Juluca . The spectacular Villa Kishti, a geometric abstraction in glass and white concrete, which opened to acclaim last year, is opening two more villas on Meads Bay soon. The restaurateurs have also stuck at it, working hard through difficult times. Anguilla's restaurants are excellent - well, it is British territory with mainly American visitors - but throw in some French chefs, and excellent produce brought via nearby St Martin, and you have excellent cuisine. Look out for Hibernia, Blanchards, Veya and Dolce Vita. On the beach at Meads Bay, Blanchards has opened its Beach Shack for simple meals, and French-inspired Jacala offers an elegant and lazy lunch.

"A couple from northern New York accused of kidnapping and sexually abusing two young Amish sisters in August are now facing 21 additional federal charges involving more victims. The case against Stephen Howells and Nicole Vaisey now involves six victims, U.S. Attorney Richard Hartunian said Wednesday. Howells and Vaisey, who live in Hermon, had previously been charged with crimes against three children, including the Amish girls, who were held for a day and released. 'Perverted': Stephen Howells, left, and Nicole Vaisey, right, suspected of kidnapping two Amish girls, now have been charged with 21 counts of child abuse involving six victims . Fifty Shades of Wrong: Vaisey's attorney said the 25-year-old, pictured here after her arrest in August, was controlled by her older boyfriend in a master-slave relationship . The new 21-count indictment had not been filed as of early Wednesday evening, so details weren't available. But Hartunian said Howells and Vaisey are charged with sexually exploiting three children between September 2013 and August 2014. Howells is additionally charged with six counts involving four children at other times. The 39-year-old man also is charged with five more counts of possessing child pornography found on five hard drives, including images and videos of children under the age of 12. 'Our goal is that they will never be near children again,' Hartunian told Syracuse.com. Howells and Vaisey previously pleaded not guilty. Vaisey's lawyer, Bradford Riendeau, declined to comment Wednesday because he had not seen the superseding indictment. He has said Vaisey, 25, was controlled by her older boyfriend in a master-slave relationship, in which she was the submissive one. Howells has three children of his own. The 7- and 12-year-old Amish girls were abducted from their family farm stand in rural Oswegatchie after being lured into the kidnappers' car with a puppy in the backseat. Father figure: Howells has three children of his own. They were not home at the time of the kidnapping . The abduction touched off a massive search in the community of about 4,000 people, but authorities were hampered by a lack of photos of the girls. The Amish typically avoid modern technology, and the family had to work with an artist to produce a sketch of the older girl. Authorities say the girls were shackled to a bed and sexually abused before they were released 24 hours later and turned up safe at the door of a house in Bigelow, New York, belonging to Jeffrey and Pamela Stinson, who drove them home. Howells, a registered nurse at Claxton-Hepburn Medical Center, and Vaisey, a former dog groomer, were arrested August 15 after voluntarily going to the sheriff's office for an interview. The original federal indictment said another young girl, now about 8 years old, also was sexually abused by the couple during the two-year span. The federal crimes Howells and Vaisey are accused of committing carry a range of prison terms upon conviction, including up to 30 years on the first count of conspiracy to sexually exploit children. Howells and Vaisey initially were held on a state kidnapping charge following their arrests shortly after the Amish girls were released. Good Samaritans: The two Amish girls were dropped off by their captors at the door of a house in Bigelow belonging to Jeffrey and Pamela Stinson (pictured) During a hearing in August, Vaisey revealed that she and Howells were on a 'shopping trip' for slaves on the day of the kidnapping. St. Lawrence County District Attorney Mary Rain said Wednesday additional state charges are possible but she will let the federal case go forward first. She said she is pleased federal authorities are ‘pursuing charges which provide greater penalties than those New York law affords.’","Stephen Howells, 39, and Nicole Vaisey, 25, had previously been charged with crimes against three children, including the Amish girls .

"England’s removal of the debris from their Australian car crash gathered apace with the selection of three uncapped players for the first Test since the ignominy of Sydney and a return for a survivor of an Ashes whitewash past. A squad which mixes new faces in Sam Robson, Moeen Ali and Chris Jordan with an experienced spine is most eye-catching for the return of a bowler from England’s past who looked finished when released by Durham two years ago. Liam Plunkett toured Australia when England lost 5-0 in 2006-07 without playing a Test but is now poised for his first appearance at the highest level for seven years after being revitalised by working with Jason Gillespie at Yorkshire. Hurting: Ben Stokes has missed out on a place in England's Test squad for the series against Sri Lanka . Back in the running: Stokes has returned for Durham after his hand injury . Point to prove: However, he has only bowled 36 Championship overs this season . Impressive: Chris Jordan (left) has starred for England in the ODI series against Sri Lanka . Plunkett, 29, has been the most consistently quick bowler in the country this season and is the favourite in the 12 to play ahead of Chris Woakes after England decided that Ben Stokes was not quite ready to regain his place in the new order. ‘Before joining Yorkshire I was going nowhere and coming to Headingley gave me a new lease of life,’ said Plunkett, who had lost all confidence in his action by the time of his departure from Durham. ‘I have benefited from a change of scenery and a coaching team that put faith in my ability.’ That team is headed by an Australian in Gillespie, who deserves the gratitude of England for developing the most impressive crop of home-grown players in the country, with Yorkshire becoming a model county for others to emulate. ‘The coaching staff have given me a simple vision which is to run in and bowl fast,’ said Plunkett. ‘I’m not over-complicating things. I’m just concentrating on generating pace and being as aggressive as I can. When I joined Yorkshire I set myself the goal of playing for England again but this still came as a shock.’ England consider pace and aggression as their key weapons against Sri Lanka on what they hope will be quick pitches now they have to fill the massive gap left by Graeme Swann, the most important casualty of the winter of discontent. It is an indictment on England’s spin resources that no specialist is considered good enough to take Swann’s place but at least that gives an opportunity to the gifted Moeen, who is the best bowler among the all-round candidates to play at Lord’s which included Samit Patel and Scott Borthwick. Borthwick, of course, was the incumbent having played in that final horror show in Sydney but misses out along with others who featured at the SCG but are unlikely to play Test cricket again in Michael Carberry, Boyd Rankin, Jonny Bairstow and, of course, Kevin Pietersen. In all only seven players remain from the winter Ashes squad but it is the experienced five among them in Alastair Cook, Ian Bell, Matt Prior, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson who England want to provide the backbone for the new era while the youngsters around them learn the Test ropes. Accumulator: Australian-born batsman Sam Robson is tipped to open for England with Alastair Cook . Congratulations: Australia batsman Steve Smith tweeted his delight at Sam Robson's England call-up . The fast show: Liam Plunkett has been bowling at 90mph for Yorkshire this season and has been recalled by England seven years after his last Test, against West Indies in 2007 . 12-man squad: Cook, Robson, Bell, Ballance, Root, Ali, Prior, Jordan, Broad, Plunkett, Anderson, Woakes. ‘There is expectation on those senior players not only to deliver but also to re-energise the team and integrate newcomers in the right, positive way,’ said national selector James Whitaker. ‘It’s very important that they are fit and firing.’ There will be those who are surprised by Prior’s return after just one championship match behind the stumps following a recurrence of his chronic Achilles condition but Cook wants this important team man back by his side and Whitaker said Prior is ‘just the sort of character we want in the team.’ Jos Buttler is clearly Prior’s long-term successor but it was only his brilliant century at Lord’s in the fourth one-day international that catapulted him into contention ahead of James Foster and the bottom line is his keeping is not yet good enough for Test level. Prior is the correct choice for England now. The other two newcomers to England’s ranks will both once again raise the vexed question of nationality as Robson is undoubtedly Australian while Jordan is as Barbadian as Mount Gay rum.Yet both have long since committed themselves to England, both comfortably fulfil the criterion for selection and both are brimming with promise and, in Jordan’s case, achievement already at international level. Ready to go: Alastair Cook will lead his England side out against Sri Lanka in the first Test at Lord's . Second beginning: Peter Moores is embarking on another stint as England's Test coach next week . Ten players who were in the Ashes squad are not in the party to face Sri Lanka. Graeme Swann has retired, Kevin Pietersen has been sacked, Jonathan Trott is having time off with stress-related issues while Michael Carberry, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Scott Borthwick, Boyd Rankin, Tim Bresnan and Monty Panesar have all been overlooked. ‘This is a special moment and I’m very proud,’ said Robson, who was born in Sydney to an Australian father and English mother. ‘I grew up in Australia but I came here at 18 and I’ve been here my whole adult life. I love England and this is where my life is. You could say I’m an old-fashioned cricketer. I haven’t played much Twenty20 and I just try to get stuck in and bat as long as I can.’ It is surprising that Stokes, the one glimmer of hope from the Ashes, is omitted but England want their fourth seamer to have more than the 36 overs the Durham all-rounder has under his belt this season after recovering from a self-inflicted broken wrist. Stokes will come again but otherwise England have picked a promising looking mix of new and old players and one in Plunkett who will provide hope to any county performers who appear to have lost their way in domestic cricket.","Liam Plunkett selected after a seven-year absence .

"When it got down to the real nitty-gritty after England’s training session in the Sun Life Stadium, Roy Hodgson just couldn’t commit. The brutal truth is that the country’s head coach just isn’t mad about Wayne Rooney any more. Hodgson went as far as to say that the England striker, with 90 caps and 38 goals, is ‘a useful player’, but wouldn’t go any further. Something has gone awry here. Again. Hodgson hinted heavily at a switch to left wing for Rooney and he was trialled in the position in a series of drills during their 90-minute training session. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Neil Ashton on England's first training session in Miami . Chance to shine: Wayne Rooney is expected to start for England against Ecuador . Lacing up: Rooney changes his boots during his team's training session at Miami Sun Life Stadium . Out to impress: Rooney will start against Ecuador on Wednesday . The trust, to play him in the hole, the No 10 position favoured by Rooney, just isn’t there. ‘I’m not saying if he’s exceptional or not,’ said Hodgson. ‘I have picked him because he is a very good player. ‘If I say yes he is exceptional or no I don’t think he’s exceptional I’m wrong either way. He’s a football player.’ This was tetchy, the kind of performance you would expect of England’s head coach when something is troubling him. ‘I decide how I want to use Wayne Rooney,’ he added. ‘There is an obsession with Wayne Rooney which I don’t really share. ‘He . can play centre forward, behind the centre forward and wide. 'If he’s . done all that with Manchester United there is no reason why I can’t use . him in those positions as well. 'I look at the players at my disposal and . decide what they need and what we need. Then I expect them to do it.’ Ready for business: Roy Hodgson speaks to the media ahead of the friendly with Ecuador . Game face: Hodgson is enjoying his time in Miami as England prepare for the World Cup . It was a brutal assessment and it will be fascinating to see how Rooney handles it today when he is pressed into action. No-one . would deny that Rooney, the only survivor from Friday’s disciplined 3-0 . victory over Peru at Wembley, needs games. The issue, as ever, is where . he plays. He . has repeated, many times over, that his favoured role for club and . country is behind the main striker. It is no longer in his hands. Rooney did OK against Peru, a steady six out of 10 playing behind Daniel Sturridge in an overall decent, effective performance. ‘The . thinking behind Wayne starting a second game is that he only played 60 . minutes against Peru,’ added Hodgson. ‘He’s recovering his match . fitness. It will be to his advantage to play another game.’ Passing game: Liverpol team-mates Steven Gerrard (right) and Raheem Sterling sharpen their skills . Close control: Frank Lampard and Adam Lallana (right) show off their ball skills . Fighting fit: Phil Jones (centre) trained with the rest of the team after injury problems . There are some other alarming features about this England team, notably the deployment of James Milner at right back today. You . have to feel for Milner because he was exceptional in Manchester City’s . midfield during their title run-in. He is not the type to make a fuss . and there will be no complaints from him, but he didn’t get picked to . play right back for England. He deserves some sympathy. ‘He’s . got the qualities to play there and there may be moments at the World . Cup when we would like to use him there,’ said Hodgson. ‘He’s in the . squad as a midfield player and that’s where we see him mostly, but it . will be interesting to see how he gets on at right back.’ Hodgson is sticking with his settled 4-2-3-1 formation, but he has made 10 changes to the team for the clash with Ecuador. He . insists the absence of Raheem Sterling from his starting line-up is no . cause for alarm, despite what Hodgson described as ‘a clamour’ for him . to be named in the team. Talking a good game: Roy Hodgson speaks with Dr Steve Peters and Sir Trevor Brooking at training . Keeping an eye on things: Hodgson takes training ahead of England's friendly with Ecuador . There . was an energy about Sterling’s performance when he came on as a . substitute on Friday and he lifted the Wembley crowd with a fearless . performance. ‘If I concentrate on where the clamour is I would be changing my team every minute,’ said Hodgson. ‘You don’t have to have any doubts about how we feel about Raheem Sterling. We feel he’s an exceptional player.’ There’s that word again — the one Hodgson couldn’t quite stretch to when it turned to Rooney.Sterling . should be among the substitutes today as Hodgson takes a closer look at . some of his alternatives in this 25-man squad on the United States leg. Ross Barkley is expected to play off Liverpool’s new striker Rickie . Lambert. It feels like a decent fit. ‘They will get their chance to show what they can do,’ said Hodgson. ‘Barkley’s here because I think he’s a very good player. ‘He’s more than capable, if selected for England, of doing a very good job for us.’ This is a big chance for the shadow squad to impress. After that, though, Rooney is the man who really is on trial.","Rooney set to start for England against Ecuador in Miami .

"Former England footballer Kenny Sansom has revealed he is homeless and sleeping on a park bench after drinking seven bottles of wine a day and gambling away his fortune. The full-back's family say they are worried because the 54-year-old has now disappeared and only has £20. Sansom is an Arsenal legend, who won 86 caps for his country, but is at rock bottom after years of struggling with alcohol. At his best in the 1980s he was earning £1,200 a week and lived in a £1million mansion. However, he is now penniless and sleeping rough after losing it all. Troubles: Kenny Sansom has struggled with alcohol and gambling since retiring and has said he is on the streets . Kenny is yet another retired footballer who has battled with booze, with Paul Gascoigne the most high-profile victim. Sansom, 54, has been sleeping on a park bench and despite a brief stay with his elder sister, he disappeared again on Tuesday. In an interview with The Sun, he said: 'I've been living homeless for 10 days. 'That's because I've got no money, I'm a drunk, I'm feeling not very well and I'm a gambler. I've been living on the street. It's not good living on the bench. Sansom, who is England's second most-capped full-back after Ashley Cole, has been drinking seven bottles of rose wine each day.

"Mario Mandzukic looks to be heading to England, and could even be Louis Van Gaal’s first signing for Manchester United, after an astonishing bust-up with Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola. Arsenal and Chelsea are leading the chase for the 27-year old striker, after already making overtures about his availability, but United are ready to compete with them after he was included in their new manager’s list of possible targets. Either way, Mandzukic is on his way out of the Bundesliga champions after infuriating Guardiola with his attitude and being told by the former Barcelona coach: ‘Goodbye, and good luck with your next club.’ Listen up: Mario Mandzukic, celebrating a goal against United earlier in the season, could be set to join them . Happier times: Mandzukic and his Bayern team-mates won the Bundesliga before the German Cup success . The flare-up happened in the wake of a 4-0 Champions’ League semi-final second-leg defeat by Real Madrid at the Allianz Arena that left the whole of Germany stunned. As he tried to make sense of it in the home dressing room afterwards, Guardiola launched into an emotional address to the players, in which he blamed himself for blundering over his team selection and getting his tactics wrong. Every Bayern player was visibly moved by his searing honesty, except for Mandzukic, who evidently shook his head and met his manager’s stare with a mocking smile. Prize guy: Pep Guardiola (right) watched his team win the cup after he left Mandzukic out of the squad . A furious Guardiola reacted by axing him from the squad that beat Borussia Dortmund 2-0 in Saturday’s German Cup final, even though he was fit enough to play. After settling on his line-up and substitutes last Thursday, he went up to Mandzukic, informed him he was being left out and wished him good luck with his next club. That could yet be United, after Van Gaal apparently cooled on the idea of pursuing a move for Bayern forward Thomas Muller, who likes to play in a withdrawn role, but set his sights on recruiting an out-and-out goal poacher, in the mould of Mandzukic. Arsenal, in particular, represent the biggest threat to his hopes, after responding to their FA Cup final triumph by promising Arsene Wenger major transfer backing for a tilt at the Barclays Premier League title next season.

"Steve McManaman hopes that Raheem Sterling and England's youngsters can light up the World Cup - and ready themselves to target winning the tournament in 2018. The ex-Liverpool and Real Madrid midfielder believes that the nation puts too much pressure on its players to perform at major tournaments but the squad Roy Hodgson has picked for Brazil is the right one. He feels that Sterling, Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw and England's promising young stars will learn from the experience and be better prepared for challenging at major tournaments come the European Championships in France in 2016 and the World Cup in Russia in 2018. Star: Steve McManaman hopes Raheem Sterling (right) or one of England's youngsters can light up Brazil . Breakthrough: Sterling enjoyed a magnificent season at Liverpool and could star in Brazil says McManaman . Pedigree: McManaman played in three major tournament for England, including the Euros in 2000 (pictured) McManaman said: ‘I hope somebody lights up the World Cup for England, and that player could be Raheem Sterling. 'He had a magnificent season for Liverpool and he has really progressed this year. He is exciting and both him and Adam Lallana can make things happen for England. 'We have several youngsters who have bags of potential but I don’t like to go overboard on a lot of the younger players because as a nation we put too much pressure on them. We always laud them up too much.' With 37 international caps and having represented England at three major tournaments, the ex-Manchester City midfielder knows the benefit of having experience of the unique environment. 'We’ve got a lot of young players who are going to take this experience from the World Cup and it will help them in the future and I think that’s the main thing for me,' he said. Gain: Youngsters like Ross Barkley (front) will benefit from tournament experience, says McManaman . Warming up: England are training in the heat of Miami in preparation for the World Cup in Brazil . Boiling: England will play their opener against Italy on June 14 at Manaus' Arena da Amazonia . 'Yes I hope they go out and light up the World Cup - I hope six of them light up the World Cup and they win it, then we can go crazy about them. But I think we all feel winning the World Cup in Brazil will be a step too far for them. 'The main thing is they go, they improve, they experience the journey, they know what tournament football’s about. Then, in two years’ time, they will be better equipped and the Euros are going to be in France, on the European continent, and they’ll perform even better then. 'Then hopefully in four years’ time, when it’s in Russia, we’ll have a real good squad of players with a huge amount of talent, a huge amount of experience, that we can take to the next level.' McManaman was speaking at the launch of the Lucozade Sport Conditions Zone at Canary Wharf in London. The centre aims to replicate the conditions that England's players will face in their World Cup opener against Italy in Manaus on June 14. And the 42-year-old, who took part in five-a-side matches in 32-degree temperatures and 76 per cent humidity, explained the difficulties of playing in those conditions. Launch: McManaman (centre) was speaking at the opening of the Lucozade Sport Conditions Zone . Extremes: The Conditions Zone replicates the 32-degree heat and 76 per cent humidity of Manaus . Punishing: McManaman described playing in the hot and humid conditions as 'very difficult' Stellar: The midfielder (left) represented Liverpool, as well as Manchester City, in a glorious career . He said: ‘It is really, really difficult - to move around in those conditions for 90 minutes will be tortuous for the players. I've only played five-a-side but they have to play on a full pitch and for a lot longer. 'I think Miami will help England’s . preparations for Manaus. England’s preparations are second to none. They’re in Miami now, it’s been hot but it still won’t . be like Manaus - nothing will be like Manaus. 'The first day, standing on . that pitch in front of that crowd at the World Cup, it will feel so . different, but the preparations building for that first game so there’ll . be no excuses.'

"An American doctor will be treated for Ebola after being exposed to the virus while volunteering in Sierra Leone. The physician, who has not been named, is expected be admitted for observation and clinical trials at an isolation unit in Bethesda, Maryland, on Sunday, according to the National Institutes of Health. The action is being taken out of 'an abundance of caution', the agency said. Quarantine: An American doctor (not pictured) that was exposed to Ebola while volunteering in Sierra Leone is to be admitted to this isolation unit in Bethesda, Maryland, run by the National Institutes of Health tomorrow . 'NIH is taking every precaution to ensure the safety of our patients, NIH staff and the public,' said an agency statement, adding that there is very low risk to the patient's colleagues. No further information has been released about the patient. NIH infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci said that, in general, an exposure to Ebola doesn't necessarily mean someone will become sick. 'When someone is exposed, you want to put them into the best possible situation so if something happens you can take care of them,' Fauci said. The death toll from an outbreak of Ebola in West Africa has risen to at least 3,091 out of 6,574 probable, suspected and confirmed cases, the World Health Organization said on Friday. Recovered: Rick Sacra, the third US doctor to be struck by the virus, celebrated a full recovery on Thursday . Elated: Sacra beamed as he told a news conference that he feels great but he is 'extremely weak' The outbreak that began in a remote corner of Guinea has taken hold of much of neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone, prompting warnings that tens of thousands of people may die from the worst outbreak of the disease on record. Four other Americans aid workers who were infected with Ebola while volunteering in the West African outbreak have been treated at hospitals in Georgia and Nebraska. One remains hospitalized while the rest have recovered. The third American aid worker who contracted Ebola in Africa was released on Thursday from a Nebraska hospital. An elated Dr. Rick Sacra said at a news conference that he was cleared of the Ebola virus by the federal Centers from Disease Control and left the isolation unit at the Nebraska Medical Center on Thursday morning. Outbreak: Officials warn tens of thousands may die from the disease which has spread to Liberia (pictured) Measures: Staff at the French NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres burn clothes belonging to patients in Liberia . 'I feel great, except that I am extremely weak,' Sacra said. The 51-year-old doctor from Worcester, Massachusetts, may return to Africa someday to help, but he said he expects a long recovery ahead based on what his friend and fellow Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly said. 'I never felt like I was not going to make it. The care was so excellent, so speedy and so prompt,' said Sacra, who contracted Ebola while delivering babies at a hospital in Liberia with the North Carolina-based charity SIM and arrived in Omaha on September 5. He is also a faculty member at the University Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. Governments are scrambling to contain the disease outbreak, and the United States has promised to send 3,000 soldiers to the region to help.","Physician will be admitted to National Institutes of Health unit in Maryland .

"Manchester United's players will be worked into the ground during 'enormously intense' 75-minute bursts by Louis van Gaal when the Dutchman takes charge in July. That is the message from Robin van Persie, who expects the Holland coach to repair the damage left behind by David Moyes during a disastrous campaign in charge. United finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to win any major silverware but their under-performing flops will be strenuously put through their paces when Van Gaal rocks up at Carrington. Out of breath? Robin van Persie has warned Man United players of the intensity of Louis van Gaal's sessions . Main man: Van Persie revealed that individual training bursts are usually 75 minutes long . Having a little chat: Van Gaal doesn't take any prisoners and was pictured talking with Nigel De Jong in training . Talking it through: Van Gaal puts an arm around Van Persie in a bid to try and get his message across . Don't argue! Van Persie will be Holland's captain when they kick off their tournament in June . Van Persie - who will be Van Gaal's captain when the World Cup kicks off next month - laid bare the volume of training the 62-year-old demands. 'Every training session is very intense. He is on our backs every minute. There is no space to relax, he demands full focus,' Van Persie told The Sun. 'We work very hard for a maximum 1.25 hour, never longer. But these 75 minutes are enormously intense.' Van Gaal's arrival at Old Trafford is certain to ruffle some feathers. He is renowned for an uncompromising nature. That means dependable players - see Van Persie - are looked after well. It could be that the striker is made United skipper when the season begins in August, and he is certainly making the right noises. Van Persie cut a frustrated figure in spells last season under Moyes and there was talk of the former Arsenal man moving on. The new arrival, however, has ended all speculation. 'I never had a relationship with a coach like I have with Van Gaal - it's very special,' the forward added. His comments show just how high Van Persie regards the international boss, but also points towards difficulties with Moyes and Arsene Wenger while at the Emirates Stadium before a £24million move up north in 2012. What do you mean?! Wayne Rooney, Phil Jones and the rest will be put through their paces in pre-season .

"Complaints against Halifax and Bank of Scotland - part of Lloyds – have soared by almost half to 265,640, the City watchdog revealed yesterday. While other major lenders experienced a drop in disputes from disgruntled customers, complaints against HBOS rose 46pc in the first half of the year, compared to the second half of last year. This was mainly driven by a surge in complaints about payment protection insurance. Complaints against Halifax and Bank of Scotland - part of Lloyds – have soared by almost half to 265,640 . It total, customers lodged 2.4 million complaints - 18,750 every working day - against financial companies in the first half of the year, a drop of 5pc. PPI disputes dropped 11pc to 1.24million. But customers made 202,617 PPI complaints against HBOS – up by more than half from 131,887 in the second half of last year. HBOS is part of Lloyds Bank, whose complaints have also risen . Complaints against Lloyds Bank also rose from 214,395 to 215,871. Last night one consumer campaigner demanded the dramatic jump in PPI complaints against HBOS as ‘depressing’. It comes more than three years after the banks lost a crucial High Court case in April 2011 and were forced to compensate customers after years of insisting they had done nothing wrong. Lloyds Banking Group, which has set aside £10.4billion for the scandal so far, said it had proactively contacted customers about PPI – prompting a wave of complaints in the first half of this year. Lobby group the British Bankers’ Association described the drop in overall complaints as ‘encouraging.’ But James Daley, founder of consumer website Fairer Finance said: ‘Banks needs to pay compensation as quickly as possible and pay the right amount to rebuild trust and finally put this scandal to bed. These figures are very depressing.’ Martin Dodd group customer service director at Lloyds said: ‘We know that there is still work to do, and that some wider industry issues have impacted our customers in the first six months of the year. However, we continue to work to make sure that our customers are getting the right outcomes.’ If you're fed up with your bank there are plenty of reasons why now is a good time to switch to another provider.

"When it comes to running for office, it pays to have people remember your name - so long as they can get it right! Spare a thought for Democratic candidate for Senate in Iowa, Bruce Braley, who thought he'd won the ultimate endorsement by having First Lady Michelle Obama  introduce him at a campaign rally. But things did not go smoothly and Mrs Obama called him Bruce Bailey instead before going onto tell the crowd that he was a Marine Corps veteran, even though he's not. My mate Bruce: First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama and U.S. Senate candidate Bruce Braley wave to the crowd after her speech at the Iowa Votes Rally during which she got his name wrong several times . Bruce whatshisname? First lady Michelle Obama  urged Democrats to send 'Bruce Bailey' to the U.S. Senate in November, repeatedly botching the name of the party's candidate in Iowa before eventually being corrected by the audience . After calling him 'Bruce Bailey' at least five or six times during her remarks at a campaign event, even directing people to 'vote.BruceBailey.com,' an audience member eventually corrected the first lady. 'Braley? What did I say? I'm losing it. I'm getting old. I've been traveling too much,' Mrs Obama said, jokingly and attempting to laughing off the gaffe. 'Vote.BruceBraley.com,' she added. 'I know where I am! I know what I'm doing! That's why we need you young people, you gotta help us out!' The flub came despite a huge array of signs in the hall where she was speaking, all spelling Braley's name correctly. Remember my name! Mr. Braley is locked in a close race with Republican Joni Ernst . The first lady repeated the mistake several times throughout her speech. She also referred to Mr. Braley — who has served in the House since 2007 — as a 'Marine Corps veteran', which he is not! On the other gaffe, the First Lady said Braley was a Marine Corps veteran, however it was actually Braley's father who served in the Marines. Mrs Obama is not the only high profile endorser to make a clip up over the candidates' name.

"England have just missed out on a place among the top seeds for next summer's World Cup despite making a considerable leap in the latest FIFA rankings. Roy Hodgson's team qualified for the tournament this week by finishing top of their group and have jumped seven places in the rankings to 10th, but it is not enough for them to make pot one for the finals draw on December 6. Hosts Brazil, who are 11th in the rankings, are automatically seeded, while Spain (first), Germany (second), Argentina (third), Colombia (fourth), Belgium (fifth) and Switzerland (seventh) are also definitely in the top pot.

Uruguay (sixth) will be the other seeded side if they beat Jordan in a two-legged play-off, but if the South Americans lose, the last seeding place will go to Holland, who are joint-eighth in the rankings with Italy. The Italians will be sourly disappointed not to have made pot one, having failed to lose a game in an impressive qualifying campaign. The Swiss, who also completed their World Cup qualifying group unbeaten to reach the finals for the third time in a row, leaped seven places thanks to their wins over Albania and Slovenia this month. Italy had been fourth but paid dearly for drawing 2-2 at home to Armenia on Tuesday. England might have been placed . higher, but Poland and Ukraine were ranked low because they hosted the European Championships in 2012. FIFA previously ruled that Brazil (ranked 11th on Thursday) plus the top seven ranked teams would be seeded for the draw at the Costa da Sauipe tropical beach resort in December. Portugal, Greece, Croatia and Ukraine will be the seeded teams in next Monday's draw for the European zone playoff round, which also features France, Iceland, Sweden and Romania. Rankings leaders Spain, the reigning . world champions, are the only non-movers in the top 10, while Germany . have replaced Argentina in second place and Italy have fallen four . positions.

Pot two: France, Iceland, Sweden, Romania . The draw for the two-legged play-offs will take place on Monday . Meanwhile, England manager Roy Hodgson clearly does not mind if his team goes under the radar in Brazil, and will use the shock European Championship triumphs of Greece and Denmark as evidence that the team should not give up on their World Cup dream. 'It's pretty obvious we're not favourites,' said Hodgson. 'The main contenders are Brazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany I guess. 'Is it possible for a European team to win in Brazil? They haven't done yet but anything is possible isn't it? 'No one thought Greece would win the Euros in Portugal (in 2004) or for Denmark to get their players off the beach in 92, but they did. 'Every year it gets that little bit harder to look beyond the favourites but I am pretty sure all the European teams will be hoping to become the first one to reverse the trend.

After putting out the fire, he and his fellow crew members found an unconscious two-month-old Yorkshire Terrier puppy collapsed under a stairwell and a terrified 10-year-old Poodle whimpering beside it. A fireman who gave a puppy mouth-to-mouth resuscitation after rescuing it from a house fire has been dubbed 'an angel' by locals .

Fire-fighter Cristobel Jover Badia, who's part of the same crew, said: 'Carlos grabbed the puppy and ran outside where he started pumping its chest. 'The poor little thing was completely limp but Carlos was determined to save him. 'He put an oxygen mask over its muzzle but when neither that nor the pumping worked he carefully prised its mouth open and started giving it mouth-to-mouth.' Neighbour Nacho Rueda said: 'It all happened very fast. Fire-fighter Cristobel Jover Badia, who's part of the same crew, said: 'Carlos grabbed the puppy and ran outside where he started pumping its chest' Mr Arana carefully prised the puppy's mouth open to give it mouth to mouth after an oxygen mask and heart pumps failed to bring the animal round .

"For those who lust after the lean, toned limbs of a supermodel, but lack the know-how on how to achieve it, Lara Stone has revealed the -surprisingly simple- moves that she used to bounce back into catwalk shape after childbirth. Appearing with her 'guru', Bodyism founder James Duigan in a video for Net-a-Porter's E-magazine The Edit, she praises the 'super gentle' routine he developed for her. The dutch model, who married Brit actor David Walliams in 2010 speaks candidly in the video about her struggle to lose weight after childbirth. Lara appears in the video with her fitness 'guru' and Bodyism founder James Duigan . While showing the moves that helped her regain her figure after childbirth, Lara admits she found the weight loss 'stressful' The five moves are designed to provide all over toning and fat burning specifically for those who haven't exercised for some time such as those who have just given birth . Having gained weight while pregnant with the couple's first child Alfred, who was born in May 2013, Lara, 30, admits that like most women, the task of losing the extra pounds was daunting. 'I'd never had to lose a significant amount of weight', Lara explains. 'I found it quiet stressful; this huge mountain of weight to lose. 'You [James] showed me that it wasn't really about that and it was about being a mother and having this beautiful baby. The five moves are designed to provide all over toning and fat burning specifically for those who haven't exercised for some time such as those who have just given birth. The first involves keeping your feet on the floor with your toes up- which engages your glutes- before slowly raising you hips up and squeezing your buttocks. This simple move is repeated about 10 times. 'They are so easy to do anywhere like in a hotel,' Lara says. James claims the next move, 'The Superman', is the 'supermodel secret to a flat tummy'. Involving kneeling on a mat on all fours before extending and retracting the opposite leg and arm simultaneously. Other key moves involves the basic squat while inhaling on the way down and exhaling on the way up, and leg lifts using a Bodyism band round the knees to add resistance. Leg lifts are done using a Bodyism band round the knees to add resistance and give extra toning . Lara shows off the results of the routine in head-to-toe black as she watches an example of the squat move . The 'non-surgical boob lift' is demonstrated; holding a slight squat also works the lower body at the same time . The final move the power pair demonstrate is the 'non surgical boob lift', which involves going into a half squatting position and holding that while fully extending the arms outwards and upwards. 'This really engages all the muscles that are going to lift up your chest,' James explains. It is difficult to imagine the notoriously elegant Lara repeating such bizarre looking moves over and over again, but the results were clearly worth it.

Appearing in head-to-toe black lycra Lara shows why she is still one of the most sort-after models in the industry even after giving birth. Refreshingly, maintaining her supermodel body doesn't seem to have stopped Lara enjoying life. Last week she was seen out with husband David enjoying dinner at famed restaurant Scott's in London. Earlier this year, Lara told Harper's Bazaar that one of the things she has in common with her husband is a 'mean' sense of humour. 'On our very first date, I was so nervous,' she recalled. 'I was in the cab home afterward and thought, I should text him and thank him for dinner. When I did, he texted back, ""Who's this?""' The blonde beauty added that since the birth of their son Alfred in May 2013, she's enjoyed watching her husband gleefully take on daddy duties. 'Just one look and he can put me and Alfred in hysterics,' she said.","The model reveals the five simple moves that keep her body lean .

"When Manchester United fans welcomed David Moyes to Old Trafford and volubly expressed the hope that he might one day emulate a club legend, it was Sir Alex Ferguson’s trophy-gathering expertise they were thinking of, not Eric Cantona’s rush of blood at Selhurst Park. But it was Cantona, lashing out in response to the taunts of Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons, back in 1995, that came inexorably to mind yesterday, as reports emerged of Moyes attacking a man on Wednesday evening. The drama was played out against the . backdrop of the Emporium wine bar in Clitheroe, housed in an old . Methodist chapel and styled on a Parisian cafe, but it could be seen as . the culmination of 29 days of rancour. VIDEO Scroll down for Wine bar where David Moyes allegedly assaulted a man . Frustration: David Moyes was allegedly involved in a scuffle with a fellow drinker at a wine bar . Twenty-nine days of pent-up anger as a proud man mulled over the details of what he sees as an unjust end to his reign at the biggest club in the country. The wine bar’s website boasts of a relaxed, informal atmosphere, but that couldn’t have been further from the truth at 10pm on Wednesday night. Moyes came from a meal with friends at a local restaurant and walked into boorish chanting and abuse. Moyes was goaded by one drinker who accused him of ‘being sh*t and never winning anything’. Others had their say,  and the verbals soon gave way to crashing glass and flying tables. Victim? Joshua Gillibrand claims he was attacked by Moyes after an incident outside the bar . The former United  manager is alleged to have hit 23-year-old joiner Josh Gillibrand on the side of a head. The police were called. An investigation is ongoing. Gillibrand was treated for concussion and a bloody nose after the  fracas, but there will be plenty whose sympathies lie with the aggressor, not the victim. It is hard to imagine what it felt like to be sacked as publicly as Moyes was, his perceived failure leading TV news bulletins as far as away as Australia. That the United board questioned his abilities and found them wanting was humiliation enough, without well-oiled  strangers - Gillibrand was ‘quite drunk’, according to a friend - now weighing in.And surely a decent man can expect to go out for a drink with his wife without running the gauntlet of boorish drink-fuelled barracking. But that’s the world we live in and Moyes must be aware that he has set a dangerous precedent. The wine bar barrackers are hardly likely to retreat now that they know his boiling point. Indeed, the abuse will probably increase. It’s a sad situation for this proud and capable Glaswegian to find himself in, the more so as he reacted to his sacking last month - which must have felt like a  personal cataclysm after being anointed as Ferguson’s successor by the great man himself - with dignity and restraint. Investigation: The former Manchester United manager is being probed by Lancashire police over an allegation of assault . He once told me, while he was Everton manager, that his response to any defeat was to go home and draw the curtains. They will almost certainly be drawn now as he returns to the safety of his home. But even there, the man who thought he had a six-year contract at Old Trafford to build his own team may struggle to come to terms with what has happened to him - both at United and on the streets of the North West. Like many football managers, Moyes has always worn his emotions on his sleeve. Much less publicly, he is also a committed Christian and it must be hurting him that he so dramatically failed to turn the other cheek. Belting someone, if that’s really what happened, is a dreadfully unseemly way for any grown man to react to taunts, especially, it has to be said, a man whose downfall was cushioned by a multi-million-pound pay-off. Wrong: Eric Cantona found himself in trouble after launching a flying kick at an abusive Crystal Palace fan in 1995 . Nonetheless, however out of character this episode was, it was always likely to be only a matter of time before Moyes saw red. After all, he must be seeing red everywhere. He couldn’t escape even when he took a much-needed holiday in Florida in the immediate aftermath of his  dismissal. Even on the other side of the Atlantic, he cut a forlorn  figure. Moyes was photographed running on a Florida beach, but even there he would stop to look at his mobile phone, apparently keeping up with events as they unfolded back in Britain. He will not have been able to escape the disgruntled in the  Preston area, where he has lived since playing for and managing Preston North End. Out and about: Former United boss Moyes with wife Pamela (left) in December . It is unknown whether his self-belief has suffered to any great extent. He is still the man who - the metaphor seems suddenly unfortunate - punched above his weight at Everton for so long. At 51, he has plenty of time to bounce back. Yet by the same token, Moyes would hardly be human if he hadn’t also questioned, at some level, whether maybe the naysayers were right, and United was just too much of a behemoth for him. A year ago, nobody, including him, knew whether the job would turn out to be a pot of gold or the deadliest of poisoned chalices. It wasn’t entirely his fault that it turned out to be the latter. Maybe it wasn’t even largely his fault. Low: United endured a difficult season under Moyes and the manager was sacked after 10 months in charge . There is certainly evidence to suggest that he was more sinned against than sinning, and Paul Scholes, who knows a thing or two about the inner workings of the club, has ventured this week that executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward should carry more responsibility for the disastrous season just gone. Moyes would doubtless echo that. It must surely irk him, and more likely infuriate him, to think that there are people still in place at Old Trafford who were at least as much to blame as he was for the catastrophic failure even to qualify for the Europa League. He is a likeable, decent, honest man, but intense even when everything is going his way. Blame game: Paul Scholes believes vice-chairman Ed Woodward (left) should take responsibility for United's poor season . So even before he fatefully went out for dinner and then on to a wine bar with his wife and a few friends on Wednesday, he must have been a seething mass of frustration, resentment and enormous disappointment that, for whatever reason, he had not managed  to live up either to Ferguson’s expectations of him, or his own expectations of himself. It was this powder keg of  emotions to which young Josh Gillibrand, in effect, set light. Moreover, it is probably no coincidence that he should have erupted just two days after Louis van Gaal was confirmed as the next United boss. Moyes can hardly have missed the media coverage, and with it the conclusion, from the most  seasoned pundit to the most naive fan, that in football terms, United now have a man big enough for the job. Every list of Van Gaal’s achievements, every analysis of the Dutchman’s supposedly huge personality, every assessment of his warm relationship with Robin van Persie, must have seemed to Moyes like a personal rebuke.

"A teenage girl who cries and sweats blood has been dismissed by medics as suffering from a mental illness for five years. Finally, one doctor has vowed to cure her incredible condition. Preeti Gupta, 15, from Delhi, India, has suffered from the bizarre illness since she was violently sick one day in November 2009 and her eyes and skin began to ooze blood. Her parents took her to hospital, assuming it was an infection and confident it would be cured. Now, five years later, they have pinned their hopes on a top doctor in Delhi. 'Many doctors think that my daughter is mad but we have seen her suffer,' said Manoj Gupta, 35. 'We're desperate for her to live a normal life. We have no idea what is wrong with her and we just want a doctor to cure her.' Scroll down for video . Preeti Gupta, from Delhi, began to cry and sweat blood after she was violently sick one day in November 2009 . Preeti, who's in and out of secondary school, said: 'When I saw blood, I panicked. I started crying and thinking what is wrong with me? What will happen to me? 'There were many questions in my mind but my dad reassured me that everything would be fine and convinced me it was an infection.' For the next 12 months the strange symptoms did not occur. But in 2010, it started again - blood seeped from her ears, scalp, fingernails, hands, legs, balls of her feet and eyes. She added: 'I know when my eyes will start bleeding because they're really painful. But once the blood flows out the pain goes and they relax, it's like a build up of pressure and then it's gone. 'In other parts of my body like my legs, palms and feet, they start itching intolerably. It's like a burning sensation. And I sometimes get ulcers in my mouth before any bleeding starts. These are always the same symptoms, no matter how small, I know when the bleeding is about to start.' This phenomenon, which is only experienced by a handful of people around the world, has left Preeti depressed and reluctant to mix with friends and live a normal teenage life. Preeti's mysterious symptoms have been dismissed by doctors in India who say she has psychiatric issues, but after five years, one doctor is determined to cure her and give her a normal life . 'I used to think why is this happening to me? Is there anything wrong with me? I just couldn't believe that my eyes were bleeding. Was I a freak? Will I lose my eyesight? What will happen to me? But thankfully my eyesight is still perfect and I do not have any troubles with my hearing either,' Preeti said. 'My friends are thankfully very supportive. They understand that I have a rare disease and have never embarrassed me. 'There have been times when my school shirt has turned red because of the bleeding but my teachers immediately send me to the medical room and call my parents.' Her father, Manoj, who works for the government and earns 36,000 Rs a month (£370), has spent 700,000 Rs (£7,000) seeing hundreds of consultants all over India. He said: 'I've taken my daughter to the best ENT specialists, hematologists, medical specialists but doctors have failed to diagnose her condition. 'My daughter is a very intelligent girl. She is not lying about this bleeding in order to seek our attention. I have seen her going through the trauma. 'I feel helpless when she starts bleeding all of a sudden and I cannot do anything to stop it. Many suggest she has psychiatric issues and have referred her to a psychiatrist. 'Some of them accuse her of scratching her skin so bad it bleeds or killing animals and smearing their blood all over her body. But who would ever do such a thing to draw attention? Since 2010, Preeti has had blood periodically seep from her ears, scalp, fingernails, hands, legs, balls of her feet and eyes . 'They say no such disease exist in the world and turn us away. It's a failure of the medical science that no reason has found for this condition.' The bleeding it is not typical blood, he said. It's a mix of liquid and quite thin, and the flow can last one or two hours, or days. Preeti added: 'Some people have said ghosts or evil spirits possesses me. It's been terrifying. 'I don't know what I'd do without my dad. He's my biggest support. He's made me strong emotionally and has always assured me that I am just a normal girl. He tells me I will fine soon. And I trust he will not stop until someone helps me.' Manoj had spent many sleepless nights along with his wife Jyoti, 34, researching their daughter's nightmare. 'I couldn't find anyone else with the same disease as my daughter but recently I got the chance to meet the mother of a girl who is also suffering the same. It was a huge relief. 'I came to know about Dr Shashidhar through a newspaper article. He is the first doctor who has given us some hope. It's been a long fight but we will fight confidently and one day we will succeed. I have confidence in this doctor and I believe he will cure my daughter.' Dr Shashidhar, a Paediatric ENT Consultant, at Artemis Hospital, in Delhi, said: 'This child has a very mysterious disorder called Haemolacria, which essentially means that the child has spontaneous episodes of bleeding from anywhere in the body. 'It can be the eyes, forehead, ears, and nose. It may involve certain systems like sweat glands or the capillary systems because after the bleeding there is absolutely no bruise, no cuts, and no marks. 'It's such an enigmatic condition that we know very little. No scientific doctor has been able to pinpoint this condition. 'While the reason for this condition is not known, calling the patient an attention seeker would be wrong. I have seen her bleeding from the palms, eyes and ears during and I can say that this disorder definitely exists but we are yet to find out the reasons for it. 'Even if it is a psychiatric condition, I am interested to know why? Until we get to the bottom of this case I will not stop. 'As a physician, I'm emotionally attached to every case and as this child is one of the biggest challenges I have ever seen it intrigues me and I'll work much harder to help.'","Preeti Gupta, 15, began to ooze blood from her eyes and skin .

"Britain could be in for a cheap Christmas this year, as a sharp drop in commodity prices and a fierce supermarket price war looks set to keep prices low for festive shoppers. Overall prices in Britain's shops fell for the 17th month running in September, as deflation rose to an annual 1.8 per cent, up from 1.6 per cent in August, new figures reveal. And it is hoped the drop will continue up until December, as big name stores and supermarkets battle for custom and lure shoppers in with competitive deals. Meanwhile the price of sending some parcels is to be cut in the run up to Christmas, saving consumers up to £5.20 per package, the Royal Mail has announced. Scroll down for video . Festive bargains: Britain could be in for a cheap Christmas this year, as a sharp drop in commodity prices and a fierce supermarket price war looks set to keep prices low for festive shoppers . The size of a 'small' parcel will effectively double to 2kg, at a cost of £2.80. A package this large would have previously been classed as 'medium' size and would have cost customers £8. The promotion will last from October 20 to January 18, allowing families and businesses to make savings by sending larger items at a reduced rate, and cramming more into a single package than they would have been able to previously. The British Retail Consortium-Nielsen Shop Price Index indicated good news for hard-pressed consumers struggling with low-wage increases in the run-up to Christmas, and marked the 17th month that prices showed a fall on the same month last year. The BRC data looks at food and non-food prices across the high street. Overall prices in Britain's shops fell for the 17th month running in September, as deflation rose to an annual 1.8 per cent, up from 1.6 per cent in August, new figures reveal . Helen Dickinson, director general of the BRC, said: 'Consumers can take heart that the outlook for inflation remains modest. 'Falling commodity prices, the strengthening of sterling, benign pressure in the supply chain and, critically, fierce competition across the retail industry suggests lower shop prices for consumers will continue.' According to the BRC figures, non-food deflation - which includes clothing and footwear, electricals and DIY among its seven categories - stood at 3.2 per cent in September, as intense competition among retailers continued to drive down prices. The report said bargains in furniture, flooring and electricals, as well as a boost of activity in the housing market, supported robust sales in this sector. Good news for consumers: Overall prices in Britain's shops fell again in September as deflation rose to 1.8 per cent, up from 1.6 per cent in August, new figures reveal . Bag a bargain: Non-food deflation, which includes clothing and footwear, electricals and DIY among its seven categories, stood at 3.2 per cent in September, as intense competition among retailers continued to drive down prices . The BRC data doesn't include categories such as electricity, transport, restaurants and hotels, and recreation and culture - which are included in the Office for National Statistics' consumer prices index. That gave an inflation figure of 1.5 per cent for August. The BRC report said food inflation stood at 0.3 per cent in September - the lowest figure on record from December 2006, amid a fierce price war in the grocery sector. Supermarkets have been battling to stave off competition from budget rivals Aldi and Lidl, whose winning formula of low cost essentials and cut-price luxuries has proved a hit with cash-strapped households. Explained: The size of a 'small' parcel will effectively double to 2kg, at a cost of £2.80 in the run up to Christmas. A package this large would have previously been classed as 'medium' size and would have cost customers £8 . BRC director general Helen Dickinson said continuing deflation was good news for UK households: 'Retailers are turning their attention to Christmas by reading current conditions and matching consumer sentiment well with their promotions and offers. 'In particular, food inflation remained at an all-time low. 'In September, over a third of all groceries going through the tills were on some sort of promotion or special offer, meaning savvy shoppers are picking the deals that work best for them, allowing them to effectively budget.' Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at analysts Nielsen, said: 'There are historic low levels of price increases across the high street, and with more price cuts expected from supermarkets over the next few weeks, shoppers will continue to get great savings. 'Whilst sales patterns are still difficult to predict, not least following the unusually warm late summer, we can anticipate a continuation of the current low levels inflation and even deflation for the rest of the year.

"For travellers worried about getting stuck in traffic en route to the airport, this could be the perfect solution. A Slovenian designer has come up with the perfect accessory for travellers who ride mini-scooters – one that turns into a suitcase or a backpack. Weighing 9lbs, The Olaf Business, which can carry up to 220lbs, is a carry-on airline-approved suitcase that can also be used as a trolley and a kick-scooter. The OLAF is a world first as it doubles as both a kick scooter and carry-on sized airline wheeled luggage . The wheeled carry-on case has extractable handle, rear brake and a folding mechanism, and can carry 220lbs . The three-in-one hybrid was developed by 36-year-old Bostjan Zagar who wanted to create a sturdy solution for his travelling needs. The Olaf Business, which will be priced at £200, is a carry-on case on wheels, with extractable handle, rear break and a smart folding mechanism. And the Olaf Urban, to be sold for around £175, aimed at city commuters, has phone and headphone space, wheel pockets and a soft wooden longboard, similar to a skateboard. Both models are ergonomically shaped and safe to use on the street due to their rear wheel brakes and reflective material. Mr Zagar's designs proved to be so popular that he recently exceeded his $30,000 Kickstarter goal . The Olaf Business is a carry-on wheeled case, with extractable handle, rear break and a folding mechanism . Mr Zagar - who developed the Olaf with his father - spent three years perfecting the accessory . The resulting designs proved to be so popular that they recently exceeded their $30,000 Kickstarter goal by more than $5,000. Using his expertise as a machine engineer and his father's knowledge in tool making, Mr Zagar began combining suitcases with scooters with his dad in their home garage in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The father-son team began mixing longboard designs with kick scooters and then worked the idea of adding luggage to it for the city commuter.

The scooter-bags are ergonomically shaped and safe to use on the street due to their rear wheel brakes . 'We thought our two products were very good and all the test drives were great,' Mr Zagar said. 'We then headed to the ISPO fair, where the Olaf was a big hit. 'The feedback was overwhelmingly positive and encouraging,' he continued. 'This gave us the motivation and the confidence to further our product development.'

"Philadelphia sports fans have become infamous for their bad behavior, but it looks like it may have paid off for once. After much public outrage from Philadelphia Flyers fans when their beloved Ice Girls cleaning crew were replaced by a group of men cleaning the rink between periods during home games earlier this year, the team has decided to bring back the ladies once regular season play begins. Anything to calm those Philly fanatics. Scroll down for videos . Coming back: After being absent so far this season, the Philadelphia Flyers announced last night the Ice Girls cleaning crew (above) would return when the regular season begins . Fan unfavorites: Many were upset when they learned the Ice Girls had been replaced with an all-male cleaning squad (above) earlier this year . The announcement was made during last night's game on the jumbotron. There was also a video of the girls that accompanied the big announcement, which led to much cheering from the crowd according to Deadspin. Fans learned the Ice Girls were no longer when the Flyers took on the Toronto Maple Leafs at the Wells Fargo Center in their first pre-season game of the year, and a group of men, and not women, hit the ice to do some cleaning. The boos and jeers inside the stadium were deafening as these gentlemen, who, unlike their predecessors, got to wear pants and a fleece, went to work on the ice. Temporary leave: It is uncertain why the girls were not back for pre-season games earlier this year . There is still no word yet on just why the Ice Girls were replaced, but one of the group's members, Erika Choi Smith, did break the news on her Twitter this August that they would not return to the rink. 'No #FlyersIceGirls this year, but just wanted to say thanks to one of our biggest fans @FlyersNation & to all #Flyers Fans for being AWESOME,' she wrote. The girls will now be back though, taking to the ice every game wearing nothing but a midriff-baring top, hot pants, leg warmers and their skates, not the best outfit for a place where the temperature is around 50 degrees. The Philadelphia Flyers also play an outdoor classic every year, where the temperature is about 20 degrees. Strict rules: The girls are asked to never fraternize with any of the hockey players and can't eat while in costume . Mother Jones  wrote an article about the Ice Girls last year, and the all-female cleaning crew for another hockey team, the Los Angeles Kings, highlighting how little the girls were paid and the many strict rules they had to adhere too. Among other things, the girls were not allowed to eat in public while wearing their costume and could not fraternize with any of the athletes, being told they should leave a bar or restaurant if they were out and one of the players came in. This negative coverage could be why the Ice Girls were temporarily replaced by the new all-male cleaning crew.","Philadelphia Flyers fans got very angry earlier this month when they learned the team had replaced the Ice Girls with an all-male cleaning crew .

"Republic of Ireland international James McClean has written a passionate open letter to Wigan fans to explain his decision to not wear a poppy during last night's game against Bolton Wanderers. Derry born McClean said  if the poppy only represented those who fought in the two world wars, he would have no problem wearing one. However, he said, as the poppy also represents those who have fought since 1945 - including during the Northern Ireland conflict, he could not wear one. McClean said he would be showing 'disrespect' to the victims of the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry if he wore one. His stance, opened him up to significant abuse on social media. Scroll down for video . Republic of Ireland International James McClean, centre, wrote a letter to Wigan Club chairman Dave Whelan explaining the reasons why he was unable to wear a poppy-embroidered shirt during last night's match . McClean defended his decision claiming that wearing a poppy would be a sign of disrespect for the innocent victims of the troubles such as those killed by British Troops on Bloody Sunday in January 1972, pictured . McClean played for Wigan last night during the team's 3-1 defeat to Bolton Wanderers. Bolton fans regularly booed the Republic of Ireland international each time he touched the ball during last night's encounter. The player met with Wigan chairman Dave Whelan, whose grandfather from County Tipperary, fought in the First World War, to explain the situation. Last night, the club’s official website published a letter from McClean to Whelan in which the winger, who was named among the substitutes, explained his stance and denied being anti-British. In that letter, McClean said he had great respect for those that fought and died in both World Wars, however, he had a great problem with the poppy representing those killed in conflicts since 1945. In particular, McClean said that as someone born in Derry, he could not support the poppy appeal. James McClean, left, faced abuse in November 2012 when as a Sunderland player he again refused to wear a poppy, although fellow Republic of Ireland international Seamus Coleman, right wore one playing for Everton . He cited the January 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre where 13 civil rights demonstrators were shot dead by British troops. He said: ' For people from the North of Ireland such as myself, and specifically those in Derry, scene of the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre, the poppy has come to mean something very different.' He said that after those events it would be 'an act of disrespect' to those people. McClean had previously refused to wear poppy earlier in his career while playing for Sunderland. Police in Sunderland investigated death threats made against the winger after he appeared as a substitute against Everton in November 2012 without wearing a poppy. Some of the more extreme elements on Twitter wanted McClean to 'drop dead' or to suffer a major injury . Twitter users were divided on their opinions on whether James McClean had made the correct decision . The statement was welcomed by many people on social media, some of whom praised McClean for having ‘the courage of his convictions’ but said it was ‘sad that it’s come to the stage he’s had to even explain himself’. Others were more scathing of the footballer’s decision and Jon Jenner wrote on Twitter: ‘James McClean shouldn’t be allowed to play in England nothing but scum [sic]’ while another wrote: ‘Statement regarding James McClean…Utterly Disgraceful Behaviour. Disgusting Individual. Early in his career, McClean played international football at youth level for Northern Ireland until he reached the Under 21s. In February 2012, McClean received clearance from FIFA to switch over to the Republic of Ireland international squad, which led to him also receiving abuse. After McClean was called up for the Republic of Ireland squad for Euro 2012 and was abused by some Northern Ireland fans. He was forced to 'retire' from Twitter after he responded to some of the abuse by telling Northern Ireland fans to watch their own team during the competition - knowing that they had not qualified. Two years ago, former British soldier Cody Lachey posted pictures of bullets on McClean's Twitter timeline. One of the tweets said: ''he deserves to be shot dead + body dragged past the cenotaph!!' Other users on Twitter expressed support for McClean's decision or his right not to wear a wear a poppy . Dear Mr Whelan . I wanted to write to you before talking about this face to face and explain my reasons for not wearing a poppy on my shirt for the game at Bolton. I have complete respect for those who fought and died in both World Wars - many I know were Irish-born. I have been told that your own Grandfather Paddy Whelan, from Tipperary, was one of those. I mourn their deaths like every other decent person and if the Poppy was a symbol only for the lost souls of World War I and II I would wear one. I want to make that 100% clear .You must understand this. But the Poppy is used to remember victims of other conflicts since 1945 and this is where the problem starts for me. For people from the North of Ireland such as myself, and specifically those in Derry, scene of the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre, the poppy has come to mean something very different. Please understand, Mr Whelan, that when you come from Creggan like myself or the Bogside, Brandywell or the majority of places in Derry, every person still lives in the shadow of one of the darkest days in Ireland’s history – even if like me you were born nearly 20 years after the event. It is just a part of who we are, ingrained into us from birth. Mr Whelan, for me to wear a poppy would be as much a gesture of disrespect for the innocent people who lost their lives in the Troubles – and Bloody Sunday especially - as I have in the past been accused of disrespecting the victims of WWI and WWII. It would be seen as an act of disrespect to those people; to my people. I am not a war monger, or anti-British, or a terrorist or any of the accusations levelled at me in the past. I am a peaceful guy, I believe everyone should live side by side, whatever their religious or political beliefs which I respect and ask for people to respect mine in return. Since last year, I am a father and I want my daughter to grow up in a peaceful world, like any parent. I am very proud of where I come from and I just cannot do something that I believe is wrong. In life, if you’re a man you should stand up for what you believe in. I know you may not agree with my feelings but I hope very much that you understand my reasons. As the owner of the club I am proud to play for, I believe I owe both you and the club’s supporters this explanation. Yours sincerely, . James McClean . At the outbreak of the First World War, Ireland had been promised Home Rule by the British Government. Constitutional Irish Nationalists such as John Redmond urged Irish men to volunteer for the British Army, in the belief that after the conflict, they would be rewarded with self-government. More than 200,000 Irish men volunteered to serve. On April 21, 1916 Irish republicans attempted to land more than 20,000 rifles and one million rounds of ammunition from a German boat on the west coast of Ireland. With the loss of the rifles, rebels from across the country were ordered to stand down, although in Dublin, the planned Easter Rising took place. Rebels seized several strategic points across Dublin City on Easter Monday, April 24. Over the next week, more than 20,000 British solders were sent to face approximately 1,600 rebels. Dublin City Centre was destroyed under heavy bombardment, killing more than 200 civilians. Civilians in Derry take cover from British Army soldiers as Fr Edward Daly, left, waves a white handkerchief while trying to escort a wounded civilian to an ambulance for emergency treatment . At the time of the rising, public sentiment, especially in Dublin was against the rebels. However, when the British government decided to execute 16 of the leaders of the rebellion, this turned public opinion - increasing popular support for what would become the Irish War of Independence. During the War of Independence 1919-1921, the British government deployed the paramilitary Black and Tans to quell the uprising using brutal methods - regularly burning the homes of suspected rebels and murdering innocent civilians. As a result of this, Irish men who served in the British Army during the First World War were reluctant to reveal this publicly. During the Second World War, again thousands of Irish volunteered to serve with British forces. Although with 'The Troubles' in Northern Ireland, British troops - especially the Parachute Regiment - were accused of civil rights abuses, such as the Bloody Sunday massacre of January 1972. In recent years, the Irish Government has officially recognised the sacrifice of Irish men who volunteered to serve with British forces during the two world wars - culminating in the visit of Queen Elizabeth II in Dublin in May 2011. Symbolically, Queen Elizabeth laid wreaths at both the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin to commemorate those who fought for Irish freedom, and a second at the war memorial in Islandbridge in which remembers Irish men who fought for Britain.","James McClean refused to wear a poppy during Wigan's game last night .

"Two RAF fighters which scrambled across Britain to intercept a foreign aircraft apparently warned the plane would be 'shot down', after it sparked a terror alert by taking an unscheduled detour over London. The Typhoons from RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, flew to Kent, south east England, at supersonic speeds to dramatically halt the plane on its way to Birmingham airport after it 'caused concern' to air traffic controllers. The swoop, which resulted in the Lativan-registered plane being grounded at Stansted airport, sparked a massive sonic boom which was heard across a 50-mile radius. Soon after the incident, chilling audio emerged appearing to show one of the RAF pilots warning the three-man crew on board the foreign plane to listen to military instructions or risk being 'shot down'. Scroll down for audio and video . A Russian made Antonov An-26 cargo airliner (pictured) was escorted into Stansted Airport while flying over London after 'causing concern' to British air traffic controllers this afternoon . An aviation expert said controllers 'probably knew' what the aircraft was - but that nobody would be prepared to take any chances incase it was 'another 9/11 on the Houses of Parliament'. In the audio footage - which has not been verified - a man is heard saying: 'I’m instructed by Her Majesty’s government of the United Kingdom to warn you if you do not respond you will be shot down’. The sound clip - which claims to be the voice of a pilot from one of the RAF pilots - was published on social media by Twitter user @RAFConingsbyInfo, an account which is not officially connected to the airbase. The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on whether or not the clip was legitimate. The drama unfolded after the flight, which took off from Italy this morning, took an unprecedented detour when it approached London. Flight mapping experts said it flew towards the centre of the capital, prompting the fighter jets to be launched from the airbase 160 miles away. The planes were part of the Quick Reaction Alert system, which is designed to respond to 'aviation security incidents'. Aviation expert David Learmount, the Operations & Safety Editor at Flightglobal, said such incidents only happen in a 'minute' proportion of flights but trigger a dramatic response because of the possibility of a terror-related incident. He said it was now confirmed that the aircraft had dialled into the wrong frequency when trying to contact UK airspace. But nobody would have wanted to take any chances at the time, he said. He told MailOnline:  'They probably know who is in the airspace, but nobody is going to take any chances. 'In these instances, it's most likely that the wrong frequency has been dialled into - which happened in this case - but there is another possibility; the possibility that there is a hijacker hiding down the back of the plane, who has decided: ""I am going to do another 9/11 on the Houses on Parliament"". 'The RAF was reacting against this threat, which is normal when an ordinary flight with a flight plan suddenly goes incommunicado and they don't know why. The flight, pictured grounded at the airport, was on its way to Birmingham airport when it was intercepted . 'They have to assume the worst - especially if its did end up heading towards Buckingham Palace or Houses of Parliament.' He added: 'The RAF is certainly not going to wittingly shoot down the flight with passengers unless convinced they would die in a terrorist attack.' A Stansted airport spokesman confirmed the aircraft had lost communications with air traffic controllers, leading to the interception over Sevenoaks, Kent. The aircraft - a Russian made Antonov An-26 cargo airliner  - was deemed safe by officials after it was checked. It is due to continue its flight to Birmingham later this evening. The Latvian company RAF-Avia, which operated the plane, said the plane had been on a routine flight when the pilots lost communication with air traffic control when it arrived in UK airspace. The plane, which was carrying automotive equipment, had taken off at 11am from Toscara in Italy, before landing in Vatry in France and then continuing its journey to the UK. This shows the flight path of the plane, which appeared to take a dramatic detour as it crossed London . Two Typhoon jets were deployed from RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire (file pic) after fears were sparked . The spokesman said it was 'probably some kind of malfunction or some emergency situation'. This afternoon's incident triggered a huge explosion-like sound, which stretched across Kent, West Sussex and as far away as Hertfordshire and Essex. After the incident, the RAF tweeted: 'Apologies if we startled you during the successful intercept this afternoon - we only go supersonic over land when absolutely necessary.' Twitter users from as far away as Dover on the south coast and Otford, in neighbouring West Sussex, tweeted about hearing the huge noise and windows shaking. Paul Dunlop tweeted: 'Jesus - Massive explosion-like noise heard down here in Sevenoaks. Whole house shook. Can see people saying they heard it across Kent.' Cleyton Tierney wrote: 'Huge bang shook the house, no idea what that was. Anyone else hear/feel it?' Ben Basten added: 'Who else felt the earth move and huge explosion in Kent 5 minutes ago? Is the world coming to an end? My house rocked.' Two RAF fighters triggered a massive sonic boom across Kent this afternoon when they intercepted a foreign aircraft. Pictured: Stansted . An RAF spokesman said: 'Typhoon aircraft were launched this afternoon from RAF Coningsby to intercept a civilian aircraft south of London which was causing concern to air traffic control authorities. 'The aircraft was safely escorted to London Stansted. To fulfill their quick reaction role the Typhoons were cleared to travel at supersonic speed, any noise disturbance as a result of this is regretted. Essex Police now have the lead.' The spokesman added that the jets were on their way back to RAF Coningsby around ten minutes later. Stansted Airport confirmed that the jets accompanied the plane to their airport, but have not revealed why. Kent Police confirmed the noise was created by RAF activity. A spokesman for Essex Police said: 'Military jets were deployed on a precautionary basis when a Latvian registered cargo plane was diverted to Stansted. 'This was due to a loss of communication with the aircraft. The aircraft landed safely at Stansted airport at around 5.20pm. 'All three people who were on board have been spoken to by police, it was established that everything was in order and reason for the short loss of communication was due to a change in airspace jurisdiction. 'Essex Police is not investigating the incident and the aircraft will be able to continue its journey to Birmingham when it is ready.' According to the company's website, RAF-AVIA, which was set up in 1990, transports 'all kinds of dangerous goods', including radioactive materials. A sonic boom is the sound associated with the shockwaves created when an object, such as an aircraft, breaks the sound barrier. In April, 2012, a massive sonic boom was heard across five counties from Somerset to Oxfordshire after two fighter jets were scrambled to help a helicopter, after its pilot accidentally emitted an emergency signal. German Air Force Eurofighter jets scrambled to intercept seven Russian Air Force planes flying in international airspace over the Baltic Sea. The jets were put on Quick Reaction Alert yesterday at Amari, Estonia as they supported NATO Baltic Air Policing in intercepting the fleet. According to the Aviationist, the package represents one of the largest fleets intercepted by NATO fighter planes in the past few years.","Typhoons were scrambled from RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, this afternoon .

"Killed: Sophie Jones died from methadone poisoning after drinking from a Tom and Jerry beaker in which the drug was being stored . A father has been convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter after she was poisoned to death drinking methadone which was being stored  in her Tom and Jerry beaker. Sophie Jones was left to collapse under the effects of the heroin substitute several hours after an eye witness said she looked 'groggy' and was falling over, a court heard. Paramedics rushed to the family home in Blackpool, Lancashire, but despite attempting to revive her, Sophie was pronounced dead in hospital just 35 minutes later. Tests later showed Sophie had traces of four separate drugs in her hair - with three of her dummies containing traces of cocaine. Methadone was also found on an upstairs bathroom sink. A jury was told how Sophie's parents Barry Jones, 41, and Michelle King, 29, were both drug addicts and the methadone had been prescribed to King. But she had been keeping it in her daughter's beaker and Fruit Shoot bottles with a view to selling it on to fund her drug habit. Both parents are now facing jail after Jones was found guilty by a jury of manslaughter at Preston Crown Court - with King having already admitted manslaughter and a further charge of child cruelty. While Sophie was in hospital the couple tried to cover up the tragedy by hiding the beaker and Fruit Shoot bottles, the court was told. King sent two text messages to Jones relating to the child's drinking cup - one reading 'all the meth bottles out back under green thing'. Another said 'don't tip meth out hide it'. Before Jones's conviction was secured, an earlier trial, which was abandoned, was opened by prosecutor Jeremy Grout Smith. He told Preston Crown Court: 'Sophie died because she was exposed to the drugs as a result of the carelessness and negligence of her parents. 'Both defendants take drugs every day smoking heroin and crack cocaine. The methadone was in a child's drinking cup - a Tom and Jerry drinking cup. The toddler's parents Michelle King (left) and Barry Jones (right) allegedly knew she was unwell and tried to cover up the fact she had ingested methadone before police searched their home, the court heard . Storage: The drug-addict couple kept heroin substitute methadone in the Tommy and Jerry beaker, pictured . In the run-up to the tragedy, a neighbour said he had often heard arguing between the adults and Sophie, pictured, would cry for a very long time without being attended to . 'Michelle King as a registered user of heroin was prescribed methadone as part of a drug treatment programme. 'Her prescription was for two 60ml bottles on a Monday and Wednesday and three on a Friday. 'The 4th of March was a Tuesday, simple arithmetic tells you there ought not to have been 146 ml of methadone in the house or anything like it.' 'Michelle King's supply ought to have been low. But we have evidence that instead of taking it herself was keeping it and selling it to other drug users and using the money she made to buy heroin and cocaine for herself and Barry Jones. 'We say they showed complete disregard for the health of the child. 'Prosecution point to the gross negligence of storing such a drug in a child's Tom and Jerry drink beaker - something that we submit Barry Jones must have known was going on and failing to keep it out of harms reach from a child only two years of age and failing to seek medical help for Sophie until it was too late. A relative told the court that Sophie was unsteady on her feet before her death, and that they had heard King say that Sophie was acting weird and Barry telling his partner 'I hope you've not left the top off your tablets' 'Sophie, after a scientific analysis of her hair, was found to be exposed to methadone, heroin, cocaine and diazepam which she had in some way ingested over a period of several months.' In the run-up to the tragedy, a neighbour said he had often heard arguing between the adults and Sophie would cry for a very long time without being attended to. King would keep the methadone upstairs and would bring it down in a bottle with a lid on so a user could drink it and then hand it back. On March 4 King sent several text messages to one drug user reminding her that she owed her £25. She had also gone to buy crack cocaine before returning home. A relative saw Sophie fall on two occasions and noticed that she was unsteady on her feet. King was heard to say that Sophie was acting weird - with Jones responding with: 'I hope you've not left the top off your tablets'. Heroin addict, Michelle King, was selling her prescribed dosage of methadone to other addicts when her child died, the court heard . The couple were told to call an ambulance but they lied about taking Sophie to a walk in centre and instead suggested the child had drunk some cider. Eventually at 11.40pm, Jones calmly called 999 saying his daughter had stopped breathing. An ambulance arrived three minutes after the call and found him in the lounge performing CPR on Sophie following directions being given over the phone. Vomit was visible in Sophie's hair, face, chest and on the floor and appeared to contain blood. At the house Jones told police that his mother and her boyfriend had been at the house and had brought with them a bottle of cider. He told them that after he left he could smell cider on the sofa where Sophie was sleeping and noticed that her bottom half was wet before noticing she was not breathing. Mr Grout-Smith said that this had been a lie and had been part of a 'joint cover up' between himself and King who had been holding back seeking medical attention in the hope Sophie would sleep off the effects of the methadone. Shocking: Tests showed Sophie had traces of four separate drugs in her hair - with three of her dummies containing traces of cocaine (pictured above, the family's home in Blackpool) 'It is the prosecution's case that the defendants knew that they were at fault and as the afternoon wore on Sophie failed to come round, they must have known,' he added. 'Prior to the 999 call made at 11:40 there had also been an attempt to clear the house of incriminating evidence. 'The child's drinking cup with methadone and had been put under a sheet in the back yard of the house, bins with shoot bottles in have been moved outside from the back of the house to the end of the street away from their house. 'The neighbour noticed that the water running the upstairs sink for significant period of time. 'The prosecution submit it must have been a joint attempt by both defendants to clear up the house. 'They were acting together to clear the house of any incriminating evidence they were both aware she had been put into a deep slumber had not woken up - they needed to protect themselves. Police found a large number of Fruit Shoot bottles at the house - one of which had traces of methadone inside. There were also traces of cocaine and heroin found in the bins . 'It is significant there were no phone calls for a period of one hour between 10:45 and the 999 call at 11:40. In the context of the usual use of phone it was an unusual silent.' When police searched the house they found hidden under a green cover in the back yard 146ml of methadone - approximately 1/4 of a pint and the Tom and Jerry beaker. Police found a large number of Fruit Shoot bottles at the house - one of which had traces of methadone inside. There were also traces of cocaine and heroin found in the bins. Tests showed Sophie's cause of her death was inhalation of stomach contents and poisoning by methadone. When he was arrested and interviewed under caution Jones maintained Sophie may have drank cider and had become a little bit sleepy before falling asleep on his knee. Both will be sentenced on December 1.","Sophie Jones, of Blackpool, died from methadone poisoning in March .

"A former professional racing driver who was sentenced to life in prison for running a massive international drug ring based in Florida is being released after serving 27 years behind bars. An ailing Randy Lanier, 60 —  who won the IMSA GTP title in 1984 and was the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year in 1986 — is being allowed to go home on Wednesday, Oct. 15, Autoweek first reported. Lanier was sentenced in Illinois Federal Court in 1988 after using the millions in gains from his drug operation to fund his racing career. Randy Lanier drove this March-Chevrolet 83G in the SunBank 24 at Daytona and, along with his team, completed 131 laps and finished 63rd in 1984 . Lanier was indicted in October 1986 for importing a whopping 600,000 pounds of marijuana from Colombia. Prosecutors said he made $68 million in profits between 1982 and 1986. 'He was in the top five people in South Florida when it came to volume,' a retired drug enforcement agent told the Florida-based Gossip Extra. 'We’re talking planes filled with the stuff coming in from Colombia.' It is unclear why Lanier's life sentence — which had no possibility of parole — has been reduced. His release papers have been sealed by a judge. Once out of prison, Lanier will have to live in a halfway house for the first half-year of his release. He will be on supervised released for three years after that. He has lined up a job at a South Florida classic car museum, according to Autoweek.","Randy Lanier, 60,  was sentenced back in the '80s for his involvement in a $68 million marijuana operation .

"Joyce Thacker, director of Rotherham's children's services (above) has finally resigned in the wake of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal . The chief of Rotherham children’s services finally stepped down yesterday, three weeks after the publication of a damning report into child abuse in the town. Joyce Thacker is the fourth senior official to resign in the wake of the investigation, which found there had been ‘serious failings’ by the council and the police in protecting 1,400 victims of grooming gangs. She had clung on to her £115,000-a-year position despite repeated calls to quit. The council announced she had left her role with immediate effect, five days after she had been put on long-term sick leave. Mrs Thacker, 56, follows in the steps of three others who have left their jobs –South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright, Rotherham’s Labour council leader Roger Stone, and council chief executive Martin Kimber. She was deputy director of children’s services before taking over at the department in 2008 and has been at the centre of the controversy sparked by the Jay Report, which highlighted the widespread exploitation of children in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. Until yesterday she seemed determined to stay in her role – repeatedly insisting that her leadership was essential for the continuity of services in the town. Mrs Thacker told MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee last week that she had given a ‘lot of thought’ to resigning but insisted she had ‘worked hard’ to improve services in Rotherham. Asked what she and Mr Wright had done about the problem, Mrs Thacker replied: ‘We knew about child sexual exploitation and abuse but we didn’t know the scale of it ... I have worked tirelessly to improve things in Rotherham and make sure that people understood it was everyone’s business to stop this.’ But Keith Vaz, chairman of the committee, said the whole committee believed Mrs Thacker should quit. She has a long track record of defiance in the face of public criticism. Even after several critical reports into the council’s failure to deal with the problem, Mrs Thacker told the Rotherham Safeguarding Children Board that she did not want them to focus entirely on child abuse. According to minutes of a meeting in March this year, she ‘reiterated’ that the council, social services and police ‘need to retain a sense of proportionality with regard to child sexual exploitation’. She said it was a very important issue but that child neglect was ‘a much more significant problem in the borough.’ Professor Alex Jay’s report into the abuse crisis in Rotherham was highly critical of her leadership. Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council (above) today said Mrs Thacker 'is to leave... by mutual agreement, with immediate effect'","Joyce Thacker, head of Rotherham's social services, has finally resigned .

"A grandmother whose life-long struggle with her weight left her desperate, isolated and on the brink of suicide has managed to turn her life around. Tracie Riley, 49, from Failsworth, lost an incredible 13st in less than a year after hitting rock bottom, and now says her only regret is that her father, whom she cared for for years, never got to see her transform her life. Tracie has gone from a  size 30 who wore a 50E bra to a  size 10 after dropping from 24st to 11st, losing more than a stone a month by following the unusual Alizonne diet at a clinic in Wilmslow. Scroll down for video . Tracie dropped from size 30 and 24st (left) to 11st and a size 10 (right) by adopting a radical meal replacement program and then slowly re-introducing healthy food . The diet uses protein-based meal replacements before phasing normal food back in and is combined with skin-tightening treatments so that clients, who lose weight rapidly, are not left looking saggy. Tracie said: 'I had got to the stage where I was repulsed by myself. I was desperate, I would have cut my legs off to lose weight. Tracie's size (left) impacted her self esteem so dramatically that she would barely leave the house but now she feels she has a new lease on life (right) 'It destroyed my life. I never looked at myself in the mirror and I would never weigh myself. I didn't realise how heavy I was. Tracie gave up work to care for her seriously ill father . 'In the end it made me suicidal. I got to the point where I thought I can't go on. It really was do or die. Thank God, I decided I want to live.' The mother-of-two worked at Hubron plastic manufacturers in Failsworth as a forklift truck driver before giving up in 2002, to care for her seriously ill father. She used her life savings to pay for the diet, which has cost her £7,000, but says it was worth every penny. Tracie, a grandmother-of-two, said: 'I found it easy, I wasn't hungry and I never gained weight once - the first week I lost 12lb.' She began her diet last November and was so committed that even her Christmas dinner was a 100 calorie shake. She said: 'I cooked turkey and all the trimmings for the family but I had a vanilla shake made from powder and water. This year I plan to be eating turkey though.' Tracie's weight problems began as a child. She added: 'I was always chubby. It really got out of hand after my second child Lindsey was born. I tried everything, I even did the cabbage soup diet for six months. 'It had got to the stage where I was afraid of food. I ruined my metabolism by trying to starve myself. I never sat down to eat a proper meal, I just snacked constantly, drank coffee and smoked. Having struggled with her weight since childhood (left, aged three), Tracie can now fit into one of her old T-shirts with her daughter Lindsey (right) 'My only regret is that my dad Bob didn't live to see me like this, but the rest of my family are thrilled and I'm happier and healthier than I have ever been.' People following the diet are given five portions of 'food' a day, each containing 108 calories. Some are sachets that can be made into drinks, others are food like protein bars. Dieters also have to take six different supplements each day and drink plenty of water. Once a week you visit the clinic to be weighed and have a blood test and blood pressure test. Every four weeks you are seen by a doctor for a check up. Tracey, who has been married for 13 years, says she was always chubby as a child and by the time she was 16 she weighed 13st. She had a very loving home, but her would was turned upside down when her father, Bob, a policeman, had a brain haemorrhage when she was six. He was bed bound for 42 years until his death a year ago. 'When I was six my dad fell ill. He had a brain haemorrhage and he couldn't speak or walk after that. 'He had 14 to 15 epileptic fits a day. I was brought up with a lot of sickness but I felt very loved. My dad was my hero. 'My dad travelled all over the world with the navy, but he could never tell me the stories about his life because he couldn't speak. 'He had bowel cancers and gall bladder cancer when he died. He had been in bed for 42 years. 'Me and my mum, Sheila, never begrudged looking after him. He was my hero without a doubt.' In the years afterwards being so heavy began to  whittle away at Tracie's confidence. Tracie now says her only regret is that her father, whom she cared for for years, never got to see her transform her life . 'I would wear baggy tops. I was disgusted with myself. I would just cover what part of my body I could. I had to cover myself up so I couldn't see it never mind other people. 'I would always wear black clothes, a black top and black pants. At the end I only had one set of clothes that would fit me so I had to wash them every night and dry them overnight. British Dietetic Association spokesperson, Aisling Pigott says:  'At a quick glance, Allizone therapy is an expensive low calorie meal replacement diet which claims to offer structured support to return to normal and healthy eating. 'Many people find this a useful method of tackling the very difficult task of losing weight. With the right support and attitude, this can be an appropriate weight loss method for some individuals. However, as with any weight management interventions, short term weight loss does not indicate success and long term weight maintenance is the most important and difficult goal. 'I do have concerns about the ethics of the advertising and wording used on this companies websites. Alizonne Therapy makes specific scientific claims such as 'stabilising blood glucose' and 'breakdown of stored body fat', however these are common principles of any healthy eating advice and evidence based weight loss programmes. Unfortunately, I was unable to locate any scientific evidence to support this. Without further information, I would certainly not recommend Allizone Therapy as superior to any other calorie restrictive diets with support to return to normal eating. 'In summary, some people may find this type of treatment useful, however obesity and weight loss is a complex and individual disease. There is no 'one size fits all' approach to weight loss and companies need to be careful they are not exploiting vulnerable clients looking for a 'quick fix' with expensive and treatments which are not maintainable.' 'Any clothes I did buy I would buy online. I was too embarrassed to go into a shop. that was part of the problem. It doesn't worry some people who are overweight to go out in public. 'But I am a shy and reserved person anyway. When you are overweight that makes it even worse. I couldn't be seen in public. 'People do look at you if you are fat and they can't help but judge you.  When someone says it doesn't bother them I think they they are lying. It must bother you. 'You would prefer to be slim. 'I just stopped going out completely. 'If there was a family meal or celebration I never used to go. It might sound funny but I was never a really big eater. 'I had been on so many yo yo diets that it was destroying my insides.' 'I didn't know which way to turn or how to get rid of this weight. I used to wake up in this morning and I felt as if i was carrying a big boulder on my back. 'I had to care for my dad. In the evenings I would just lie on the sofa and watch TV. And then I couldn't get up I was that big. 'So a few weeks before my dad passed away I decided to go to this clinic and make this appointment. 'They were so good. A year before I would never had the courage to even go there because of how I looked. But I had reached rock bottom and I just stopped caring. 'I was at the lowest ebb. They were brilliant at the clinic. I wish this was was available on the NHS. The success rate would be astronomical, but the NHS can't fund something so expensive. 'This treatment has saved my life in one way. If I had carried on the way I was going my heart would have packed in because of the strain. I could have died before I even had the treatment I was that big. Breakfast: Several of 30 daily cups of coffee made with milk . Lunch: Milky coffee . Dinner: Roast chicken dinner; milky coffee .

"From the outside it looks like it could still light up a city but the Frank R Phillips power station in South Heights, Pittsburgh was living on borrowed time. The World War Two era relic was just weeks from demolition. Photographer Matthew Christopher thought it was important that he documented the buildings which form part of America's growing rust belt. When it was commissioned in 1943, it produced enough power for the whole of the city of Pittsburgh and cope with the demands of war production from the heavy industrial plants. The coal-fired plant was wound down in the 1990s as demand for heavy industry declined and attempts to reopen it failed. Eventually it was earmarked for demolition. The Frank. R. Philips power station in South Heights Philidelphia looks like it is a ready to provide electricity for thousands of homes across the area . Inside however, the control room looks like something from a bygone era banks of analogue dials and switches, and a distinct lack of flat screens monitors . Deeper inside the aged building, which was demolished in 2011, are the engineering stations where dozens of people had to closely monitor the power station's output . Writing on his blog, Christopher explains: 'After a few years of trying, a good friend of mine was able to arrange a tour of the Frank R. Phillips Power Station less than a year before it was demolished. While the plant was a lot more modern and was much less decayed than some I have been to, the sheer scale of the plant was amazing. 'At over 11 stories, there was simply no way to see the whole plant in a day, but we did cover quite a bit of ground. The engineer who lead us through the plant knew every aspect of its operation and was nearly as interesting as the plant itself. It was an exhausting day in a string of long days out taking pictures, but it was still a disappointment when it ended and even moreso when the plant was demolished and the opportunity to return was gone forever.' As well as power plants, Christopher, 36, has also shot empty churches, hotels, hospitals and prisons. Christopher, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, revealed two of the sites he photographed - Westport Generating Station in Baltimore and Frank R. Phillips Power Station in South Heights - were demolished soon after. He estimates that he has photographed more than a dozen power plants all featured in his soon to be released book Abandoned America: The Age of Consequences. Christopher said: 'I do quite a bit of research to identify locations I'd like to photograph and I'm fortunate I have friends who have helped me out with connections or information.' He said: 'It's important to me to work with people who manage these sites to present the places in a way that doesn't cause them any problems. 'They can also be quite dangerous so you have to be very careful. But they are also my favorite type of places to photograph. 'People seem fascinated by these sorts of places too. 'Most of us will never get to see what the inside of a power plant looks like yet we're dependent on them to produce the electricity that powers everything in our homes.' More information on Christopher's photography tours to abandoned locations can be found on his Facebook  page . The amazing images form part of photographer Matthew Christopher's Abandoned America series which documents the rusting hulks of the nation's industrial heritage . According to Christopher, he wanted to capture the building which was completed in the early 1940s for posterity before it was eventually demolished . Despite working in a power station, the operator of this antiquated phone had to spin the wheel to generate enough current to carry his phone call . This is the Turbine Hall of the Westport Generating Station in Baltimore, Maryland which was demolished in 2008, providing a view into the industrial past . These turbines used to spin furiously generating power for thousands of people and businesses across the east coast of the United States . But along with the demise of heavy industry in the area, the need for old fashioned, coal-fired power stations was lessened and they were eventually decommissioned . Matthew Christopher travelled across the east coast of the United States documenting the decline in the rust belt states as heavy industry moved on . The giant machines look like they have been created to last for eternity, but much of the metal on display has already been recycled into new goods . Christopher said he wanted to document the industrial past before it was demolished . Running a coal-fired power station was a massive logistical undertaking with large quantities of fuel needed every day from their own elevated railway . The rusting hulk of this turbine marks as a stark reminder of the decline in America's industrial strength as heavy industry has moved to the far east . These coal chutes fed the massive furnaces around the clock with a constant stream of railway carriages providing fuel for the insatiable beast .","The Frank R Phillips power station in South Heights Pittsburgh first operated in 1943 providing war time energy .
