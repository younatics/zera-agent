"Mary Berry has said that children should be banned from bringing mobile phones and electronic games to the dinner table. The Great British Bake Off judge believes that the move could help combat the obesity crisis. Mrs Berry, 79, enforces what she dubs a 'Downing Street rule' in her own home and asks visiting children – as well as her children and grandchildren – to hand in their gadgets before dinner. Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry believes children should be banned from using mobile phones at dinner . She said: 'The first thing to do is to sit down, and the second is to take every mechanical aid off the table. 'When the children and grandchildren come to see me, they hand in all their games and phones at the door. I call it 'the Downing Street rule', because that's what they make you do if you go to No 10. 'If people could just do those two things, learn to enjoy smaller portions and not eat between meals, I really think it would help combat obesity.' The bestselling food writer and TV presenter said it is essential for young people to be educated about what they eat and that obesity is one of the 'worst problems' facing the country today. She uses a mobile for texting her children, but does not use Twitter  like her Bake Off co-star Paul Hollywood . She said she uses a mobile phone for texting her children, but – unlike her Bake Off co-star Paul Hollywood – does not indulge in social media. When asked whether she had adopted the modern habit of taking 'selfies', she added: 'Certainly not. But people seem to want me to do one with them all the time and I'm completely baffled. 'Presumably they all want to tweet it and say, 'I've just met Mary Berry'.' Mrs Berry told Glamour magazine about her concerns over young people's relationship with food, saying the 'whole thinness thing is very, very worrying'. She called for young women to be offered normal role models in fashion and the media, adding: 'But the worst problem of all in this country is obesity. 'It's so important for the young to be educated about what they eat.' Mrs Berry has previously called for better lessons for schoolchildren, saying all pupils should be taught to make ten basic, healthy meals before they leave school. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival last year, she said teachers should go back to showing young people 'what's good for them, how to buy it and how to make a few dishes that they and enjoy and don't cost too much'.","Mary Berry says children should not be allowed to use mobiles at dinner .

"The harlequin (pictured) is eating other ladybirds, including the 2-spot and 10-spot, at such a rate it has become one of the world's fastest spreading insects . British ladybirds are under threat from a cannibal species from Europe. The harlequin ladybird, which is now the second most common in the UK, is eating other ladybirds - including the 2-spot and 10-spot - at such a rate, it has become one of the world’s fastest spreading insects. Since the harlequin was spotted in the UK in 2004 it has bred with astonishing ferocity and there are currently more than a billion. Hundreds of householders have reported plagues inside their homes. A new study is the first to use DNA analysis to identify prey species in the guts of harlequins showing their ‘damaging effect on native species.’ Originally from East Asia, the harlequin is larger and more voracious than native British ladybirds that have become part of its diet. Although mainly an aphid predator, it is believed to be responsible for the decline of some other ladybirds through competition and cannibalism. In total, 177 larvae were collected from the wild in England, France, Germany, Slovakia and the Czech Republic before being tested. Three of the four target prey species were detected in the guts of harlequins including the 10-spot ladybird (Adalia decempunctata) found in 9.6 per cent, 2-spot (Adalia bipunctata) in 2.8 per cent and marmalade hoverfly (Episyrphus balteatus), also in 2.8 per cent. The only insect tested for, and not detected, was the green lacewing (Chrysoperla carnea), said the study published in Entomological Science. In total, 177 larvae were collected from the wild in England, France, Germany, Slovakia and the Czech Republic and then tested. Three of the four target prey species were detected in the guts of harlequins including the 10-spot ladybird (found in 9.6 per cent) and the 2-spot (pictured) at 2.8 per cent . Dr Peter Brown, of Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, said: ‘This study shows harlequin ladybirds in the wild commonly prey on a number of insects other than just aphids.

The . only insect tested for, and not detected, was the green lacewing . (Chrysoperla carnea), said the study published in Entomological Science. ‘The results offer further evidence the harlequin is a generalist predator which is having a damaging effect on native species across Europe. ‘Ladybirds and other aphid-feeding insects are a very important part of ecosystems - acting as natural pest controllers. 'There are 47 ladybird species in the UK - and it’s vital this diversity is maintained.’ The 7-spot ladybird - the classic red one with the black spots - is still Britain’s most common species, and the harlequin has had little effect on this as their habitats rarely overlap. ‘But other species - such as the 5-spot which is only found in Wales and one or two places in Scotland - could be at risk of eventual extinction because there are relatively so few of them,' adds Dr Brown. ‘There’s not much we can do to stop the march of the harlequin - our only hope is spiders and some wasps that prey on ladybirds do a better job at catching them. We’re in the hands of Mother Nature.’ In 2003 there were no harlequins in the UK but now they have spread to all parts of the British Isles and are proving deadly to those that cross it. It produces a noxious, foul-smelling chemical that can stain furniture and its bite can trigger an allergic reaction in humans. At around 0.3 inches (7.5 millimetres) in diameter the harlequin is considerably bigger and more aggressive than most native types and will breed several times a year.","Study is first to use DNA .

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's speech at Georgetown University today was met with tepid enthusiasm from students, with just half of seats in the reception hall appearing to be filled. Pictures and video discovered by the Daily Caller show empty clusters throughout the 750-seat auditorium in which she spoke as part of a security conference being held at the Washington, D.C. university. This is at least the second time in recent weeks that Clinton has been unable to pack a room during an appearance just as the clock winds down for her to make a decision about whether she wants to carry her political party's torch in 2016. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discusses 'Smart Power: Security Through Inclusive Leadership' at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. today. Clinton is back on the speaking circuit now that the midterm elections have concluded . This photo, shared on Twitter by a Politico photographer depicts a mostly empty balcony area during Hillary Clinton's speech in Georgetown's Gaston Hall today . In late October Clinton served as the headliner at a rally for Maryland Lt. Governor Anthony Brown, who was campaigning to become the Bay State's chief executive at the time, at the University of Maryland's College Park campus. After the event was over, Brown's staff claimed that more than a 1,000 supporters came out to see Clinton, but it was evident that there were far fewer attendees, as most of the nose-bleed seats on one side of the gymnasium were empty, as were areas of the bleachers on the side. Clinton spent a good deal of her time throughout the fall barnstorming the country, attempting to save embattled Senate Democrats from electoral defeat. Today denoted one of just a few non-political speeches she's given since, and she is slated to make remarks at two events in January and February. Her Feb. 24 speech at the first-ever Watermark Silicon Valley Conference for Women has raised eyebrows among politicos as Clinton has repeatedly promised to make an announcement about her political future at the top of the year. Once she declares her candidacy for president - if she intends to at all - it would be frowned upon for her to continue charging business executives upward of $200,000 for a slice of her time. The recently announced February speaking date indicates that Clinton may wait until early spring to make her decision public. A second photo taken by the Politico staffer shows empty blocks in the main area of the 750-person hall, as well . Polls continue to show Clinton atop the 2016 field should she follow through on a second presidential run. A CNN survey released on Tuesday shows her decimating her competition in the Democratic primary and earning 65 percent of her party's support. Democrats' second choice, progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, received just 10 percent of the vote in the hypothetical match up. Trailing Warren were Vice President Joe Biden at nine percent and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at five percent. Coming in at just one percent were New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, retiring Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Without Clinton in the race, Biden, a former Delaware senator, would jump to the top of a plurality of Democrats' wish lists, followed by Warren, with all other possible contenders failing to earn double-digit support.","This is at least the second time in recent weeks that Clinton has been unable to pack a room during an appearance .

"It's a dinner party scenario we are all familiar with. But red wine spills on the carpet could be a thing of the past, thanks to a new glass design. The clever Saturn spins around on its base, never fully tipping over as it resets itself to a new angle. The new Saturn wine glass is said to be 'spill-proof', no matter which way you tip it the wine won't come out . The company behind the creation, US-based Super-Duper-Studio, said: 'These spacey glasses are our re-imagination of a traditional Italian glassblowing technique, which we appropriated to prevent messy spills and stains. 'Four years of research and refinement has culminated in Saturn Glasses that are surprisingly light and satisfying to drink from.' Christopher Yamane, a graphic and industrial designer, teamed up with designer Matthew Johnson to create the glass, for which a price has not been revealed. Explaining the method used to make the Saturn glass, the studio said: 'To prepare the material for each cup, the molten glass is shaped by hand before being blown into a mold by glass artisans in Oakland, California. 'Each glass is then annealed overnight (a process which cools the glass slowly to relieve material stresses), cut, and polished by hand.' It's nice to enjoy a glass of wine with friends... but not so nice when someone has an accident! Christopher Yamene who designed the wine glass said that it is especially perfect for red wine as it does not matter if the temperature of your hand affects the drink . The glasses are said to hold a small to medium-sized glass of wine - about 125ml-175ml. They stack into each other and will stand upright on a flat surface. The only issue with the glasses, Yamene explained to design website Dezeen, is that without a stem, the heat of the hand can affect the temperature of the wine. He said: 'One small downside for not having a traditional stem seems to be how the temperature of your hand affects the temperature of the wine, but isn't as big of a problem in the red as the white.' Red wine is typically drunk at room temperature although it can be served slightly warmer, while white wine is generally served chilled. If you haven't managed to get your hands on a set of Super-Duper-Studio's Saturn wine glasses then you might want to check out these handy tips for removing a red wine stain... 1. The Salt Trick . This only works if you act fast but tipping a small amount of salt onto the spill can help to draw the wine out. 2. Dab, don't rub! Dab the red wine with a cloth but make sure you do not rub it. Rubbing will only increase the size of the stain and make it worse. 3. Shake your soda . Pouring soda water onto a red wine stain can remove it. Slowly pour the water onto the stain, letting it bubble. When it has removed the stain dab any excess liquid with a cloth. 4. Boil it up . Particularly good for clothing stains, boil a hot kettle and stretch the material out over the sink. Pour the boiling water down through the item of clothing which will wash out the stain. 5. Crush that cat litter . It might not sound like the most savory method but crushing cat litter onto the stain can help to absorb the wine much in the same way that salt would. Oh dear, spilling red wine can be an absolute nightmare if you don't know how to get it out .","Glass designed by Super-Duper-Studio promises to be 'spill-proof'

"The family of an 18-year-old mother who died when a surgeon drilled into her brain are suing two NHS trusts for £500,000 in damages. Rachel Bradshaw died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after suffering a catastrophic liver failure, having taken an overdose days earlier when she split up with her boyfriend. Mother-of-one Miss Bradshaw had regretted her actions and attended Northampton General Hospital - but her family claim staff did not act in time. Mother: Rachel Bradshaw took an overdose  when she split up with her boyfriend and died in February 2009 . It led to her needing a liver transplant and being sent to Birmingham where the accident occurred. A surgeon decided to insert a pressure bolt into her skull, but allegedly drilled too far into the brain. Her parents, Brian, 47, and Terry Brock, 50, are suing on behalf of Miss Bradshaw’s now seven-year-old daughter, Kyla, for the loss of her mother in February 2009. The High Court heard Miss Bradshaw had taken an overdose and went to the Northampton hospital, where her blood was tested. Levels of the painkiller in her blood did not mean she needed immediate treatment and she was sent home. Continuing to feel ill, she returned to see a GP at the hospital, but was again sent home. In the hours afterwards, she became very ill, collapsed in front of her mother and was rushed back to hospital. Mrs Brock told the court she only realised how bad the situation was when they were told that Miss Bradshaw needed a transplant. ‘I was just shocked, it was horrifying,’ she told the court. Court case: Miss Bradshaw's parents, Brian, 47, and Terry Brock, 50, are suing on behalf of her now seven-year-old daughter, Kyla, for the loss of her mother. The parents are pictured with their solicitor, Caron Heyes . The parents followed Miss Bradshaw to Birmingham and stayed in overnight accommodation at the hospital, but received a call at night to say she had taken a turn for the worse. ‘We went over to see her and then they said they would take her down for a brain scan,’ Mrs Brock said. ‘Then the doctors and the nurses took us into a family room and told us there was nothing more then could do. They said they had to turn off the machine...and that was it. They never explained to us what had happened.’ Mr Brock was with Miss Bradshaw when the machine was turned off and his daughter died in front of him, only a short time after they had been told there was hope she could survive. Miss Bradshaw's parents are claiming for the psychiatric damage which seeing their daughter die did to them as parents. Northampton General Hospitals NHS Trust and University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust deny liability for injuries to the family. However, the Birmingham trust accepts the ‘negligent’ placement of the bolt killed Miss Bradshaw, who was from Northampton. The family’s barrister, John de Bono QC, told Judge Michael Yelton that Northampton medics were negligent in not testing Miss Bradshaw's blood the second time she went to hospital. Treatment: Mother-of-one Miss Bradshaw died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (pictured) in Birmingham . ‘It is rare for someone to return to an A&E department - this was an urgent situation which mandated prompt investigation,’ he said. If the seriousness of her illness had been known, medication would have begun and she would not have needed to go to Birmingham, where she met her death, he added. The court heard the Birmingham trust had denied breach of duty in relation to the insertion of the pressure bolt until only last month. Then, on November 14, it admitted that the bolt was inserted wrongly and that that caused the bleeding on the brain which killed Miss Bradshaw. Mr and Mrs Brock are suing both Northampton and Birmingham in their own right for the serious psychiatric injury they say they were caused by the way Miss Bradshaw died. The suddenness of Miss Bradshaw’s death, after being told there was a ‘ray of hope’, worsened the shock and was part of the cause of their ‘nervous shock’, their lawyers say. Contesting the claims, the Northampton trust says it owed no duty of care to Miss Bradshaw as A&E staff didn’t see her between her first time in hospital and when she returned after her collapse. Both trusts claim Miss Bradshaw’s parents would have suffered a psychiatric reaction however their daughter had died. The hearing continues.","Family of Rachel Bradshaw, 18, are suing two NHS trusts for £500,000 .

"Tim Howard has claimed that fellow American Brad Friedel 'actively tried to block' his move to Manchester United in 2003 - a charge the Tottenham veteran has called 'ludicrous'. Howard was signed by Sir Alex Ferguson from Major Soccer League side Metrostars (now the New York Red Bulls) to replace Fabien Barthez before eventually joining Everton permanently in 2007. However, in his new autobiography The Keeper, Howard claims he was told that Friedel refused to submit a statement on his behalf ahead of the transfer. VIDEO Scroll down for Tim Howard wins 2014 Male Athlete of the Year . Everton keeper Tim Howard has claimed that Brad Friedel tried to prevent him joining Manchester United . Former US No 1 Friedel claims that he never wrote a negative letter towards Howard . Friedel strongly refutes the suggestion, telling ESPN: 'It's complete garbage. To be honest with you, all we're looking for is an apology. We can't get the book reprinted. I'm not looking for monetary gain. I just want an apology.' In extracts of his book revealed exclusively by ESPN, Howard says: 'Man U told us that Friedel had refused to submit a statement on my behalf,' Howard writes: '""You're kidding me"", I said. Friedel was among what was then a handful of American players in the Premier League; his influence was huge. 'Having himself been denied several times, he understood better than anyone exactly what was at stake. Why wouldn't he vouch for me? 'I mean, who would sabotage his own countryman like that?' Howard arrived at Old Trafford from MLS side Metrostars in 2003 and spent three seasons with United . Howard and Friedel embrace after a Premier League  game between Everton and Aston Villa in 2009 . Howard says he later learned from United's legal team that Friedel, then playing in the Premier League for Blackburn Rovers, 'hadn't merely refused to sign a statement on my behalf, he had actively tried to block my transfer. 'He'd written to the appeals committee suggesting that I shouldn't be given a work permit at all.' Friedel initially responded to the claims by saying: 'There is no letter.

"Texas Governor-elect Gregg Abbott disclosed on Wednesday that his state, along with 16 others, had filed a lawsuit against President Barack Obama and his administration over changes to the immigration system. 'The president’s unilateral executive action tramples the U.S. Constitution’s Take Care Clause and federal law,' Abbott said in a statement today. Joining Texas in the lawsuit are  Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The formal announcement of the lawsuit followed numerous threats from Abbott and other GOP governors to take Obama to court in response to his recently issued immigration memorandums and comes just two days before Abbott is scheduled to meet with Obama at the White House on another matter. Texas Attorney General and Gov.-elect Greg Abbott speaks against President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration last month in Austin, Texas. Abbott formally announced his state's lawsuit against the president today over his immigration actions . Texas' current governor, Rick Perry and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker have been saying since the day the president announced his decision to defer deportation for nearly 5 million immigrants that their states would consider suing Obama, and Abbott followed up Obama's proclamation with a threat of his own. 'President Obama has circumvented Congress and deliberately bypassed the will of the American people, eroding the very foundation of our nation’s Constitution and bestowing a legacy of lawlessness,' Abbott said in a statement at the time. Today he decried Obama for taking actions that 'directly violate the fundamental promise to the American people' to abide by the Constitution. 'The ability of the president to dispense with laws was specifically considered and unanimously rejected at the Constitutional Convention,' Abbott stated, according to Fox News. The legal arguments laid out in the suit are the violation of Article 2, Section 3 of the Constitution, which states that the president 'shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. It also claims that at shift in federal policy will 'exacerbate the humanitarian crisis along the southern border, which will affect increased state investment in law enforcement, health care and education.' Outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry said at a conference last month that it costs his state roughly $12 million to defend the U.S. border with Mexico, which overlaps substantially with the Texas border. At a presser today separate from Abbott's, Perry said, 'In effect, [Obama's] action placed a neon sign on our border, assuring people that they could ignore the law of the United States.' Today's announcement to sue over the issue was not unexpected as Abbott had said on Monday that the lawsuit would formally be filed 'any day now.' 'We are dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s,' he said on Fox News program On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. The president's orders would give green cards and work permits to qualifying illegal immigrants if they pass a background check and would allow them to stay in the U.S. indefinitely without the threat of removal. 'In effect, [Obama's] action placed a neon sign on our border, assuring people that they could ignore the law of the United States,' outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry said today during a presser . Abbot said on Monday that Obama doesn't have the authority to do that, though. 'While the president or his attorneys may have the discretion whether or not to prosecute someone, they don’t have the authority to give rights to people they are not prosecuting and put burdens on other agencies to carry out all these orders so this is, as you know, far from prosecutorial discretion,' he said. Insisting that the lawsuit is not about his ideological opposition to the Democratic president, Abbott said Monday, 'I think it’s extremely important to emphasize that I am addressing this as a legal issue, not a political issue. 'The president has crossed the line from politics to endangering the constitutional structure,' the Republican politician said, per the Austin American-Statesman. Abbott has already sued Obama 30 times before today while serving as attorney general of the Lone Star State, with the new lawsuit making 31 times. On Friday he'll have the distinct honor of meeting the very man he's sued so often at the White House in Washington, D.C.

"An aborted theatre tour of the cult Sky Sports programme Soccer Saturday is still the subject of legal action more than two years after four shows were cancelled. Entertainer Mike Osman, a close friend of Soccer Saturday regular Matt Le Tissier, arranged the abandoned roadshow. He continues to pursue presenter Jeff Stelling for breach of contract. Presenter Jeff Stelling is being pursued for breach of contract over a Soccer Saturday theatre tour . Osman claims to have lost £250,000 after dates in Liverpool, Newcastle, London and Birmingham were cancelled following successful shows in Southampton and Bournemouth. It is claimed ticket sales suffered after Stelling failed to fulfil promises to promote the show. It is believed the marathon legal row has strained relationships on the programme, with Osman also said to have contracts in place with Phil Thompson, Charlie Nicholas and Paul Merson, as well as Le Tissier. Osman said: ‘These things take a long time to resolve but I’m not giving up.’ Sky Sports are aware of the dispute but say they are not involved, even though the roadshow used the official Soccer Saturday brand. Mark Clattenburg has not taken charge of a Premier League fixture since October 25 . Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg looks still to be paying the price for going in his own car to an Ed Sheeran concert after a match — and taking a call from manager Neil Warnock en route — rather than leaving in the official transport. Clattenburg, a Champions League referee and widely regarded as one of the best in England, was stood down for one match at the time. But he was on Championship duty last weekend, then relegated further to fourth official in midweek and next Saturday. The conspiracy theory is that referees’ chief Mike Riley favours other elite officials, including Michael Oliver, who received no reprimand after his fiancee Lucy May travelled in the officials’ vehicle this season. A source said Oliver asked permission. MCC have appointed Gerald Corbett to succeed Oliver Stocken as chairman next October. Corbett, who had a torrid time as CEO of Railtrack, has chaired six public companies including Britvic and Betfair. But even though he has been an MCC member since 1995, he has not served on any of the Lord’s committees that would have given him some knowledge of the lunatic fringe who have disrupted the ground renovation. Corbett, whose cricket career peaked when he beat the Westerleigh prep school bowling record of F1 legend James Hunt, said: ‘I’m used to arriving from planet Mars but getting my feet under the table pretty quickly.’ Ticketmaster have given assurances about the sale of 2015 Rugby World Cup tickets .

Robertson on Coe team . Former Minister for Sport Sir Hugh Robertson will be part of Lord Coe’s campaign team in his bid for the IAAF presidency. Robertson’s know-how from his spell in the Foreign Office with responsibility for the Middle East and North Africa will be utilised to unlock doors in the chase for more than 200 votes. Sir Hugh has yet to decide whether to stand for his Faversham and Mid Kent seat at the General Election next year, but currently has time on his hands to be of significant help to Coe. However, the biggest diplomatic issue for Coe might be keeping the peace between his two warring communications and strategic chiefs Jackie Brock-Doyle, a close adviser over London 2012, and bid specialist Mike Lee, who runs Coe’s PR for the IAAF presidency. It’s safe to say Lee and Brock-Doyle, who surprisingly attended the Lee-organised launch of Coe’s manifesto, do not like each other.

"A fourth doctor has died of Ebola in Sierra Leone after a failed bid to transfer her abroad for treatment. Dr Olivet Buck died last night hours after the World Health Organisation said it could not help medically evacuate her to Germany. Sierra Leone had requested funds from the organisation to transfer her for treatment saying it could not afford to lose another doctor. Scroll down for video . A fourth doctor has died of Ebola in Sierra Leone after a failed bid to transfer her abroad for treatment (file picture) But Chief Medical Officer Dr Brima Kargbo today confirmed that the Sierra Leone national had died on Saturday night. WHO had said it could not meet the request but instead would work to give Dr Buck 'the best care possible' in Sierra Leone, including access to experimental drugs. It is a huge setback for the impoverished country that is battling the virulent disease amid a shortage of health care workers. A total of 301 health workers had become infected with the disease as of September 7 in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to WHO. Of that tally, which included suspected and probable cases in addition to confirmed ones, 144 had died. Because Ebola is only transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of people showing symptoms or from dead bodies of Ebola victims, health workers have been especially vulnerable as they respond to the worst outbreak in history. A man suspected of suffering from Ebola lies in the street in Monrovia, in Liberia which shares a border with Sierra Leone. A total of 301 health workers had become infected with the disease as of September 7 in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organisation . The infections have exacerbated shortages of doctors and nurses in West African countries that were already low on skilled health personnel. So far, only foreign health and aid workers have been evacuated abroad from Sierra Leone and Liberia for treatment. Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctor, was being considered for evacuation to a European country when he died of the disease in late July. Ebola victims suffer vomiting, diarrhea, internal and external bleeding in the final stages of the disease, leaving their bodies coated in the virus. To treat the sick, doctors require training and protective clothing - both of them scarce in Africa. The outbreak - the first in West Africa - was detected five months ago deep in the forests of southeastern Guinea. But it was not until August 8 that the World Health Organization declared an international health emergency and promised more resources. The doctor's death comes just days after a study found that the Ebola outbreak could hit 15 countries across Africa - putting the lives of 22 million people at risk . The doctor's death comes just days after a study found that the Ebola outbreak could hit 15 countries across Africa - putting the lives of 22 million people at risk. In a world first, Oxford scientists created a map of places most at risk of an Ebola outbreak warning regions likely to be home to animals harbouring the virus are more widespread than previously feared, particularly in West Africa. Around 2,400 people have died from Ebola in the current West Africa outbreak, which has infected at least 4,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal. The World Health Organisation says it will take months to bring the epidemic under control and is warning there may be up to 20,000 cases before it is stopped.","Medic dies of Ebola in Sierra Leone after failed bid for treatment abroad .

"CLICK HERE to read Everton manager Roberto Martinez's comments after the game . Ferocious in Europe, flimsy at home. If Everton’s progress in the Europa League has been without a hitch, uncertainty dogs their domestic form. A game at home to Hull City, in theory, should have been a straightforward opportunity for Roberto Martinez’s squad to make up lost ground in their pursuit of a top four spot. When Romelu Lukaku gave them a first-half lead, all seemed to be going to plan. Had this been a contest on a Thursday night, Everton would, in all likelihood, have motored away but there is something about the Barclays Premier League that means their footing is not so sure. VIDEO Scroll down fro Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Everton 1-1 Hull City . Substitute Sone Aluko wheels away after equalising with a low shot past Tim Howard (left) to rescue a 1-1 draw for Hull .

They squandered another lead, this time Sone Aluko profiting from lax defending to secure a 1-1 draw. Martinez has been eager to embrace Everton’s European adventure, but this was the first occasion when he admitted that, perhaps, the extra demands are having a negative impact. Running out of energy and ideas in a lacklustre second half, Everton were booed off at the final whistle. ‘I don’t think it was a negative reaction,’ Martinez argued. ‘I think it was the fans seeing that they had three points in the bag but then leaving with one. ‘Our supporters have been magnificent. I think it was more about emotions than a moan. The longer the game went on, the worse it was for us. ‘We had five shots on target, 13 chances. Hull stopped the clock and made it difficult for us to build momentum. I’m not bitter about the way the opposition played. ‘We need to learn from this. Teams are coming here and making it difficult for us. We need to get back to where we are.’ The pitch is prepared at Goodison Park ahead of the Premier League clash between Everton and Hull .

If Martinez was irritated, his opposite number was in a better frame of mind. Having endured a month of misery, seeing his side plummet into the drop zone on the back of four straight defeats, finally Steve Bruce had some respite. It had looked as if the barren run Hull have endured was going to continue at Goodison Park, when Lukaku pounced in the 34th minute, but Bruce’s introduction of Aluko for the injured Mo Diame could not have been better timed. Aluko’s arrival gave Hull an injection of belief and gave purpose to their play. Within five minutes of replacing Mo Diame, he had scored the goal to secure a point for Hull and allow Bruce to relax. His side have suffered some cruel luck in recent weeks, so this was long overdue. ‘We need a result and we need to give everyone a lift,’ said Bruce. ‘The last month has been difficult. This league is unforgiving. ‘Thankfully we have taken something from the game. If there was going to be a team to win it in the second half, it was going to be us. ‘It has been a frustrating time. The only time we have let ourselves down was at Burnley. We could be four, five six points better off. But others could say that. ‘This is the second season and that is harder. We have to deal with expectation.’ The Belgian striker drops to his knees and points to the sky after breaking the deadlock in the first half .

Teams with brittle confidence would have folded when Everton started passing the ball with purpose, inspired by the surging runs and clever movement of Kevin Mirallas. When Phil Jagielka chipped a pass forward and Lukaku flicked it on, Mirallas scampered down the flank to stretch Hull’s defence. He pulled the ball back for Lukaku, who did the rest, driving in from 10 yards with his left foot. It was his seventh goal of the campaign. Yet that was as good as it got. Hull began the second half with purpose, preying on Everton’s lethargy and they got their reward when Aluko drifted beyond a limp challenge from Sylvain Distin before drilling a shot beyond Tim Howard at the near post. From that point, Hull — who almost won it when a header from former Everton player Nikica Jelavic dropped the wrong side of the post — were comfortable and Everton ran out of ideas. A point gained for Bruce, two squandered for Martinez. ‘In the second half of the season we have to get back to our way of playing,’ said the Everon manager. That lesson needs to be heeded otherwise their top four hopes will slip away. Hull midfielder Tom Huddlestone (right) skips over a tackle from Everton's Muhamed Besic .

"Nico Rosberg proved he is unwilling to allow Lewis Hamilton to ride roughshod all over him by turning in a dominant day of practice ahead of Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix. After emerging from a controversial race in Belgium where he and Mercedes team-mate Hamilton collided with a season-high 29-point lead, Rosberg has been on the receiving end of a backlash from the Briton. Five successive victories have allowed Hamilton to turn the tables on Rosberg and open up a 24-point cushion to the German with two grands prix remaining, at Interlagos on Sunday and Abu Dhabi on November 23. Lewis Hamilton, winner at the last five races, takes a trip off track as he aimed to reel in  Nico Rosberg .

Sergio Perez  Force India . Rosberg, however, showed he is far from finished as he topped the timesheet at the end of both 90-minute sessions, initially on the medium-compound tyre in the morning and then soft rubber in the afternoon. Rosberg's best time of the day was a one minute 12.123secs for one of the most-renowned circuits in F1, with Hamilton just over two tenths of a second adrift - the same for both sessions. For once, it was Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari - rather than team-mate Fernando Alonso as has often been the case - emerging the best of the rest, with the Finn just over half a second adrift. As for Alonso, his session came to a premature end when his car burst into flames after he had pulled off the circuit, initially with smoke billowing from the rear of his car. Alonso finished down in seventh come the conclusion to the day, 0.999secs off of Rosberg's pace. In between the Ferrari duo were Daniel Ricciardo in his Red Bull and Williams pair Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa, the latter on home soil and finishing 0.976secs adrift. Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat was next up, followed by Sebastian Vettel in his Red Bull and McLaren's Kevin Magnussen to round out the top 10.

Sebastian Vettel (right) and Hamilton jostle for track position during the second practice session . As for Jenson Button, the veteran was down in 16th in his McLaren, just over two seconds back following a frustrating day. In FP1 Button suffered an ERS (energy recovery store) failure at the end of his installation lap that kept him in the garage for the rest of the session. If Button thought he had problems, though, then he perhaps spared a thought for Force India's Sergio Perez who failed to turn a wheel in anger all day. In giving way to Daniel Juncadella in FP1, the Spaniard crashed the car to such an extent that repairs were impossible in order to allow Perez to get out on track in FP2.","Rosberg fastest in both sessions ahead of Mercedes team-mate Hamilton .

"President Barack Obama has described the ebola outbreak in West Africa as ‘a threat to global security’. His warning was echoed last night by Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond who said the epidemic in West Africa could become a ‘global catastrophe with disastrous consequences’ without more humanitarian support. The US President announced plans this week to send 3,000 American troops to the region to help build new healthcare facilities. Scroll down for video . 'We could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected' in west Africa, Obama warned on Tuesday . Mr Obama said the disease required a ‘global response’ as a worsening outbreak would lead to ‘profound political, economic and security implications for all of us’. He said: ‘In West Africa, ebola is now an epidemic, of the likes that we have not seen before. It’s spiralling out of control: it is getting worse; it’s spreading faster and exponentially. ‘Today thousands of people in West Africa are infected. That number could rapidly grow to tens of thousands. And if the outbreak is not stopped now we could be looking at hundreds of thousands infected. ‘This is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security. It’s a potential threat to global security if these countries break down, if their economies break down, if people panic.’ Obama met Tuesday morning with Dr. Kent Brantly and his wife, Amber. Dr. Brantly contracted the Ebola virus while doing missionary aid work in Liberia, but has recovered completely . Britain is to provide hundreds of extra beds to treat people affected by the deadly virus as part of a £100million aid package. Mr Hammond confirmed work is progressing to provide 200 beds to Sierra Leone while a further 500 will be supplied in the coming months. Last week it was announced that British military personnel are setting up a 62-bed ebola treatment centre near Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. Meanwhile, a healthy British woman became the first volunteer to receive a potentially life-saving new vaccine to tackle the virus yesterday. Ruth Atkins was injected with the experimental drug at Oxford University as part of a safety trial. If successful, it will be used to treat patients in West Africa where 2,500 people have now died. The 48-year-old from Marcham in Oxfordshire is one of 60 volunteers taking part in the UK trial over the coming weeks, which has been fast-tracked because of the worsening outbreak. After being given her injection, she said: ‘I feel absolutely fine, it felt no different to being vaccinated before going on holiday.’ Mrs Atkins, an NHS communications manager who has also worked as a nurse, will keep a diary of her side effects over the next eight weeks and have regular blood tests. She said she volunteered ‘because the situation in West Africa is so tragic’. Ten thousand doses of the drug are being manufactured by British drug company GlaxoSmithKline in the hope it will be approved for use.","President said: 'If the outbreak is not stopped now we could be looking at hundreds of thousands infected .

"Attorney Gloria Allred today challenged Bill Cosby to pay $100 million in damages to the women who claim he sexually assaulted them. The lawyer introduced three alleged victims - two who have never spoken before - and as they broke down in tears, she told Cosby he could waive the statute of limitations so all the women accusing him of assault could have their day in court. If not, she said, he could stump up $100 million - and the money would be handed out to the women by a committee of retired judges. Demands: Attorney Gloria Allred is flanked this afternoon by Bill Cosby accusers, from left, Chelan Lasha, Beth Ferrier and Helen Hayes . Weeping: Chelan Lasha, now a grandmother, breaks down on Wednesday afternoon as she claims that Cosby drugged and assaulted her when she was 17 . Options:  Gloria Allred says Cosby can either stump up $100m to his alleged victims - or waive the statute of limitations so they can have their day in court . Speaking at her California law offices, Miss Allred said she had been forced to tell many women who had contacted her to report abuse at the hands of the comic legend that they were too late to file a lawsuit due to the statute of limitations. However, she said: 'Today, I am here to propose two new solutions to this public dilemma and a away to determine if Bill Cosby is a saint of a sexual predator.' She said that if Cosby, now 77, is 'confident' he has done nothing wrong, he could waive the statute of limitations, adding: 'Then his alleged victims would have an opportunity to have their allegations dealt with on their merits. 'Bill Cosby would have an opportunity to address there allegations in a court of law and the victims and Mr Cosby would have an opportunity to have a judge and jury decide who should be believed.' This would be similar, Miss Allred said, to the Catholic Church cases in California, which involved allegations of sexual abuse by priests.  A law allowed victims to sue within a one year period. Under fire: Bill Cosby has yet to make a public statement about the wave of women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual assault . Tears: Bill Cosby's alleged accusers face the cameras at Gloria Allred's LA offices on Wednesday afternoon . Alternatively, Miss Allred said, if Cosby did not want to waive the statute of limitations, he could pour $100 million into a fund, adding that anyone who claims to be a victim could put their case in front of a panel of retired judges, who would act as arbitrators, who would then decided if their case had merit - and how much damages they would be awarded. Cosby has an estimated fortune of $400 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. He has made his fortune through numerous endorsements including Jell-O, Coca-Cola and Ford - and dominating TV in the 1980s with The Cosby Show. Cosby’s syndication deal in 1988 also earned him a fortune. Rights to air The Cosby Show for three years were sold to Fox for $550 million. He currently lives with his wife of 51 years, Camille, in a compound in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, that includes two large farmhouses. They couple moved in in 1971 and also bought several acres around the town for conservation purposes. However, Miss Allred said: 'It's time for justice and accountability and we challenge him to end this nightmare, both for him and the alleged victims by accepting either of the options that I proposed and we look forward to his response.' Chelan Lasha, from California - now believed to be a 46-year-old Grandmother - told how Cosby attacked her when she was just 17 in 1986 when she was an aspiring model. Weeping, she said her stepmother had sent pictures of her to the star and he called her at home in Las Vegas, inviting her to the Hilton Las Vegas, where he was performing and she had a job. She then went up to Elvis Presley suite to meet him and after telling him she had a cold, he gave her a blue pill, which he said was an antihistimine, with a double shot of Amaretto. The woman who started it all: Andrea Constand, a former basketball player, sued Cosby in 2005 and settled later on. Beth Ferrier was Jane Doe No 5 in Andrea's civil court case . Emotional: Former supermodel Janice Dickinson says Cosby drugged and raped her in 1982 . She said: 'He was rubbing my neck and saying that he might have to have someone come in and give me stress therapy.' She claimed he told her to change into a Hilton bathrobe and wet her hair to see the modelling scout. Someone did briefly come up to the room, pertaining to be from the Ford Modelling Agency -telling her to she needed to lose 10 pounds - and taking some pictures. Then, Chelan said, Cosby walked her to the bedroom and gave her another shot of Amaretto, which he claimed would help her cold. 'I laid down,' she said: 'He laid down next to me on the bed and began pinching my left nipple and humping my leg while he was grunting. 'I could not open my eyes. I couldn't move or say anything. I felt something warm on my legs. Then I blacked out.' No comment: Bill Cosby today thanked Whoopi Goldberg and singer Jill Scott for their support on Twitter - but has made no public statement . 'Thirteen to sixteen hours later I woke up by hearing Mr Cosby clapping his hands and saying 'Daddy says wake up'. He gave me $1500. He said the money was to buy something nice for me and my grandmother and he also invited me to go to the Temptations show with my grandmother. 'My grandmother went but I did not go because I was too sick. Then he invited us to his show. My grandmother really want to go. I did not, but I went with her and heckled him. As a result, I was fired my from job.' Chelan was joined by two other women, Helen Hayes, who claims Cosby fondled her breast after stalking her and her friends 'like a predator' after they met in the summer of 1973. Beth Ferrier, meanwhile, who has already come forward, alleges that she had an affair with Cosby, which ended in him drugging and raping her - and leaving her to come to in her car in an alleyway. She was Jane Doe 5 in the civil suit brought against Cosby by Andrea Costand, the first woman to allege he had attacked her, in 2005. Former basketball player Andrea ended up settling out of court.

"Manchester City emphatically overcame their  curse at Sunderland with a 4-1 victory. An early goal from Connor Wickham gave  Gus Poyet's side the lead but Sergio Aguero equalised immediately before Stevan Jovetic put City ahead. Defender Pablo Zabaleta got the third before Aguero found the net for his second. Here's how the players rated at the Stadium of Light: . Sunderland (4-1-4-1) Costel Pantilimon 5.5 . Beaten four times but hard to blame him for what were a collection of brilliant finishes. Santiago Vergini 5.5 . For a full back, he’s actually quite enjoyable to watch and thinks nothing of dropping a shoulder and out-witting a winger at his own game. Defensively he remains suspect and was caught cold for Aguero’s second. John O’Shea 6 . Aguero targeted Coates and that pays a compliment to O’Shea, who has been outstanding of late. He tried his best to organise against City’s star-studded offence but that was a tough ask. John O'Shea (left) had a difficult evening for Sunderland against Manchester City and Sergio Aguero (right) Sebastian Coates 5 . League debut for Black Cats and the last player he wanted to be facing was Aguero. He was skinned for the striker’s equaliser and his rustiness showed against top-quality opponents. Anthony Reveillere 5 . Has been in brilliant form since his free-transfer arrival last month but he found it tougher against Navas and struggled badly at times. Lee Cattermole 6 . Not as devastatingly disruptive as he was against Chelsea – although that would have been a tall order to repeat – but still got through his usual work with minimum fuss. Will Buckley 5.5 . He huffs and puffs but doesn’t really blow any defences down. Puts a shift in nonetheless. More quality needed though. Jack Rodwell 5.5 . A little subdued and did not stamp his mark like sidekick Larsson. Still struggling to make an impact since his £10m move from City in the summer. Jack Rodwell struggled to impress for Sunderland against his former team at the Stadium of Light . Seb Larsson 7 . Enjoyed exploiting gaps in behind City’s backline with cute passes early on and was at the heart of everything the hosts did offensively. Connor Wickham 6.5 . A touch of good fortune with opening goal but he deserved that for the endeavour which took him into the box. Connor Wickham (centre) put Sunderland into a surprise lead, but they could not hold on . Steven Fletcher 6 . Tough task as lone man but he does it well and kept City’s central defenders occupied in first half. Subs . Jozy Altidore 5.5 (on 55), Ricky Alvarez 6 (on 67) Not used: Bridcutt, Brown, Cabral, Gomez, Mannone . Manchester City (4-2-3-1) Joe Hart 6 . Very little to do and had little chance with goal. A routine evening. Pablo Zabaleta 7 . Recovered from his part in Sunderland’s opener to put in typically robust display and his goal, dinking over Pantilimon, was a touch of class. Pablo Zabaleta celebrates scoring City's third in the game against Sunderland . Dedryck Boyata 6.5 . Shaky start but found his rhythm and could now win a little run in the side. Martin Demichelis 6.5 . The partnership with Boyata took a little while to gel and, early on, looked like it might cost City dear as the hosts repeatedly slipped balls in behind their pair. But he steadied and cruised through the last hour. Gael Clichy 6.5 . Kept Buckley quiet and joined the attack as often as possible. Was unlucky not to see one of his crosses converted. Yaya Toure 6.5 . Again he never emerged from second gear and strolled through the contest. Still, he hardly put a foot wrong. Fernandinho 7 . A lot more energetic than Toure and saw a lot of the ball. Did well. Jesus Navas (top) skips over the challenge from Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole . Aguero gave the Sunderland defence a torrid evening and scored two goals for his team . Jesus Navas 7.5 . Caused his full back all manner of problems and fizzed a string of balls through the box without any takers. Samir Nasri 7 . A killer through-ball for Zabaleta’s goal and enjoyed more space as game wore on. Some delightful touches in and around the area. Stevan Jovetic 6.5 . An uncompromising finish to put City in front but wasn’t involved a great deal and eventually made way. Sergio Aguero 9 . Outstanding. Scored two – taking his tally for the season to 19 - and created one, winning applause from the home fans when he was replaced late on. He really is the best striker in world football right now. Subs . James Milner 6.5 (on 55), Frank Lampard 6 (on 74), Jose Pozo (on 84) Not used: Sagna, Fernando, Caballero, Esmoris Tasende .","Connor Wickham put Sunderland into the lead after 19 minutes .

The match reportedly started when a football was kicked by one of the British troops into No Man's Land. A memorial to the Christmas Truce will also be unveiled - designed by a 10-year-old Spencer Turner from Newcastle, who won a national competition. It will reside permanently at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Spencer was told he had won the competition by Newcastle stars Steven Taylor and Adam Armstrong during a special assembley at his school Farne Primary on Thursday. The competition was judged by Prince William, president of the FA, and Arsenal forward Theo Walcott.

"Sony is set to officially name North Korea as the source of the recent cyber attack which has exposed massive volumes of internal company data and shut down its computer systems for a week. The results of an investigation into the attack, currently being carried out by FireEye's Mandiant forensics unit, are expected to be announced later this week. On Wednesday, two unnamed sources close to the investigation told Re/code that the tools used by the hackers are similar to those used in attacks conducted against South Korea by North Korea. Culprit? Sony is set to name North Korea as the source of the recent cyber attack which has exposed massive volumes of internal company data and shut down its computer systems for a week . There has been speculation that the attack could be payback on Sony for The Interview, a Seth Rogan and James Franco movie about a plot to kill the reclusive state's leader, Kim Jong Un, that is out on Christmas Day. Earlier this week, a North Korean spokesperson refused to deny claims that it was behind the move and would only say 'wait and see' when asked if Pyongyang was involved. 'The hostile forces are relating everything to the DPRK (North Korea). I kindly advise you to just wait and see,' a spokesman for North Korea's U.N. mission. North Korea routinely refers to the United States and South Korea as hostile forces. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the incident. A North Korean spokesperson said 'wait and see' on Monday when asked if Pyongyang was involved in the attack on Sony just a month before its planned release of The Interview, staring James Franco and Seth Rogan . Launched last week, the attack forced employees of the movie studio to shut down computers and work with pen and paper. Later, sensitive files including employee salary data, product plans and video files of five motion pictures - including the remake of Annie and Brad Pitt's critically acclaimed World War Two movie, Fury - were leaked to the internet. Personnel information including staff salaries and personal emails were also leaked. North Korea complained to the United Nations in June about The Interview, accusing the United States of sponsoring terrorism and committing an act of war by allowing production of the movie. The Pyongyang government denounced the film as 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war' in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Cars enter Sony Pictures Entertainment headquarters in Culver City, California. A cybersecurity expert has raised the possibility that the cyberattack on Sony Pictures was not the work of North Korea . 'I personally don't care if (the movie's) disrespectful to Kim because he's evil. But that's not the intent,' tweeted Rogen on Sunday. 'North Korea has produced tons of propaganda films that portray America's destruction.' But cybersecurity expert Hemanshu Nigam has told the Hollywood Reporter that he finds it hard to believe that North Korea is the perpetrator and instead thinks it is more probable that it was the actions of an employee or ex-employee with administrative access privileges. For the studio - which has laid off hundreds of employees over the past year in an effort to contain costs - the possibility of a disgruntled employee wreaking havoc is very real. 'If terabytes of data left the Sony networks, their network detection systems would have noticed easily,' said Nigam. 'It would also take months for a hacker to figure out the topography of the Sony networks to know where critical assets are stored and to have access to the decryption keys needed to open up the screeners that have been leaked.' Sony workers saw a message appear on computer screens saying 'Hacked by #GOP' - understood to be the initials of a group called Guardians of Peace which has been linked to North Korea . In addition, he said, 'It is possible that North Korean-sponsored hackers were working with someone on the inside. But it is more likely a ruse to shift blame, knowing the distaste the North Korean regime has for Sony Pictures.' Sony Pictures' computer system went down last Monday after the cyber attack. Before . screens went dark, they displayed a red skull and the phrase . 'Hacked By #GOP,' which reportedly stands for Guardians of . Peace. The hackers also warned they . would release 'secrets' stolen from Sony. The data released so far from the apparently leaked documents has already been damaging - it revealed all the top executives at Sony Pictures Entertainment are white and male, raising questions about control of Hollywood's film output. Staff at Sony are growing increasingly disgruntled about the never-ending slew of Adam Sandler movies the company is producing . Staff at Sony are growing increasingly disgruntled about the never-ending slew of Adam Sandler movies the company is producing, according to information released following last week’s cyber attack. An un-encrypted text file titled ‘Sony_2012_Comments’ has been released which features a long list of negative employee feedback – and Sandler’s name is a reoccurring theme. The comedian’s company, Happy Madison Productions, has been responsible for 25 films released by Sony over the past 15 years including Click, I Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry, You Don’t Mess With The Zohan, Grown Ups and 50 First Dates. These movies turn a profit but are shown little love from the critics and from Sony staff it would appear. Here are some of the comments featured in the leaked document: . Other criticism from staff was equally as cutting even if the target wasn't quite so specific: . Sandler movies such as I Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry regularly turn a profit for Sony but rarely win over the critics or staff a leaked memo has revealed . A spreadsheet said to show the salaries of 6,000 Sony Pictures employees, including top executives, reveals that of 17 earning $1 million or more a year, just two are not white and just one is a woman. The list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site Fusion. Kevin Roose, reporting for Fusion, who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source, said: 'When I sorted the list by 'annual rate,' I noticed something notable: a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most. 'Based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of Sony Pictures with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men.' Amy B. Pascal, co-chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment and chairman of SPE's Motion Picture Group, is the only woman among the top 17 most-highly paid executives. Minority of one: Co-Chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment Amy Pascal, the only woman earning more than $1million a year at the company, and chief executive officer of Sony Entertainment Michael Lynton . Leaked: Five of Sony's movies including the hotly anticipated remake of Annie have been illegally shared online in recent days . She earns £3million a year, according to the spreadsheet, joint highest on the list, along with Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton. Buzzfeed reviewed almost 40GB of leaked internal data and reported it included 'employee criminal background checks, salary negotiations, and doctors' letters explaining the medical rationale for leaves of absence.' It reported the files also included a script for an unreleased pilot written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan as well as 'email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing, while one disciplinary letter details a manager's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate.' It even details the leaked information includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive. In addition to Annie, starring Jamie Foxx, which is due to hit theaters on December 19, Brad Pitt's critically acclaimed World War Two movie, Fury, is also being openly traded and downloaded online. By Sunday morning, Fury, which is still playing in theaters, had been downloaded 1.2 million times and Annie had been downloaded 206,000 times from unique IP addresses, according to Variety. Other Sony movies being downloaded include Mr. Turner, Still Alice and To Write Love on Her Arms.","Investigation has found tools used by the hackers are similar to those used in attacks conducted by North Korea against South Korea .

"He doesn’t juggle or ride a unicycle - and it's unlikely you'll ever see him at a children's birthday party. Instead, this creepy clown spends his free time lurking in empty car parks and dark subways - before hammering strangers to near death with his trusty iron weapon. But luckily, the violent clown is merely a circus act - who has been created as part of an elaborate prank to trick random members of the public. Scroll down for video . A video made by two men from Italy, which shows a clown attacking victims to fool strangers passing by, has become an online sensation . To see more pranks by DM Pranks click here . Now the video starring the clown, created by two pranksters . from Magione, Italy, has become an online sensation. Matteo, one of the men behind the video, said the clown prank film - which took ten days to make - was incredibly unique. He said: 'I think we are doing some content never ever seen on the web, especially our social experiments and also our extreme pranks. 'Our . social experiments are a pure eye opener for the people. On the other . side we really like to do hardcore pranks like the clown one because is . something unique.' Matteo and Diego, from DM Pranks . Productions, have made film pranks since they were at college but only . started uploading their videos onto YouTube last July. The three-minute video - which has now been watched by nearly £3m on YouTube - shows the scary-looking clown shocking different strangers with his violent ways. The film, made by Matteo and Diego from DM Pranks Productions, was made as a prank video to fool strangers into thinking they had witnessed a serious attack. It has now been watched by nearly £3m people on YouTube . In the first prank, the video shows the clown waiting covertly in an almost-empty car park until two unsuspecting men walk past . The two horrified men look on as the violent clown prepares to slaughter the man lying on the ground . The clown is heard laughing hysterically as the fake person is left lying in a pool of blood in the car park . In the first prank, the clown - who is dressed head-to-toe in usual circus attire -  is shown hiding behind a corner in a near-empty car park, with a lifeless body at his feet. As soon as . two men walk past, the clown smashes down his iron hammer onto the . man's head, watching as a pool of blood splatters out onto the concrete below. The clown is then seen laughing hysterically as the two frightened men run off screaming into the distance. That scene is just the first of four other pranks, in which unsuspecting strangers are fooled into thinking they have witnessed a nasty clown killing or seriously injuring another person. In another prank on the video, the clown is seen approaching a lone man who is sitting on a plastic chair in a dimly-lit subway . The clown then smashes the person's head with his iron hammer, causing the man to fall off his chair and bash his head on the concrete . The video then shows the clown chasing after the witness, who runs out of the subway looking terrified . Matteo said the clown video was the most difficult film he has ever made - not least because . the first hammer he so carefully crafted weighed a staggering 58kg and was impossible to use. He told MailOnline: 'The clown prank has been the most difficult and risky prank we ever did. 'The whole process of elaborating the idea, finding spots, gathering costumes and crafting a properly hammer took something like ten days. An unsuspecting driver is the next victim in the video, as the clown walks up to the car and starts dousing petrol onto the station forecourt . The man is seen asking the clown what is he doing and who he is - but the sneaky clown remains silent . 'Then the filming process has been something really long. We waited for hours and hours to find the good victims.' But the channel has taken off in a way the filmmakers did not think was possible - even being listed as the most subscribed YouTube channel of the past 24 hours, with 126,000 new subscribers. The filmmakers usually work as a two-man band, but occasionally draft in . help from Matteo's cousins for the most 'dangerous and risky scenes'. For this video, the pair avoided children, people with animals and anyone who could have been aged over 40. Another prank sees the clown hover in a dark bush until two strangers walk past a man sitting on a wall . The scary clown is seen laughing after he smashes the man on the head from behind with his trusty weapon . The clown then chases the two men away from the scene as the prank continues . He said: 'For the clown video we decided also to avoid girls because we were worried about the fake blood. Maybe some girls could get shocked while a male might have a stronger mind.' But even though the pair's popular film has been watched by millions across the world, they still have to be careful about getting into trouble with their elaborate mind games. He said: 'This is the reason why we are at least four people while recording a dangerous scene. 'Also we don't reveal straight away that is a prank because people will get mad in less than a second. 'Once they get calm and smile we reveal the prank. It's a psychological trick that works extremely well in the end and everyone goes away smiling.'","Italian duo have become online sensation with their clown prank video .

"U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services waited less than one day to launch a hiring drive – seeking 1,000 new federal workers – after President Obama announced November 20 that he would act on his own to provide legal papers for millions of illegal immigrants. A new USCIS facility in Crystal City, Virginia is poised to immediately begin implementing Obama's plan, far in advance of a Republican congressional takeover that had the potential to stop him or slow him down through legislators' 'power of the purse.' 'USCIS is taking steps to open a new operational center in Crystal City, a neighborhood in Arlington, Virginia, to accommodate about 1,000 full-time, permanent federal and contract employees in a variety of positions and grade levels,' the bulletin reads. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE BULLETIN . NOT MESSING AROUND: The Obama administration took less than a day to launch a massive hiring push after the president announced his executive actions to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants into US society . 'The initial workload will include cases filed as a result of the executive actions on immigration announced on Nov. 20, 2014. Many job opportunities at the operational center will be announced in the coming days and please continue to monitor USAJOBS if you are interested.' The bulletin lists 32 examples of job openings, each of which was posted online on November 21. They include a chief of staff who will earn between $124,995 and $157,100 per year, and program analysts who will earn more than $138,000. Jobs earmarked for recent college graduates start in the range of $34,415 to $55,421. The White House did not respond to a question about how far in advance the decision was made to open the hiring floodgates. USCIS similarly did not respond to a request for comment about how long its plan had been in the works. Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions blasted the administration on Wednesday for the move. 'This facility is a clear symbol of the President’s defiance of the American people, their laws, and their Constitution,' Sessions said in a statement.' 'He is hiring federal employees to carry out a directive that violates the laws Congress has passed in order to foist on the nation laws Congress has repeatedly refused to pass.' Sessions warned, however, that a coming Republican majority in both the House and Senate could choke off the funds needed to pay 1,000 new salaries. 'The president cannot spend money unless the Congress approves it,' he cautioned, 'and certainly the Congress should not approve funds for an illegal amnesty.' NOT AMUSED: Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, warned that Congress could choke off the funds needed to pay 1,000 new salaries at USCIS . Sessions has emerged as one of the Senate's loudest critics of Obama's immigration policy shift, calling it a job-killer as he predicts a flood of newly-legalized illegal immigrants will rush to displace citizens from scarce jobs. 'This action will mean that American workers, their sons, their daughters, their parents, will now have to compete directly for jobs, wages, and benefits with millions of illegal immigrants,' he said Wednesday. Reached at his Senate Budget Committee office, Sessions communications chief Stephen Miller told MailOnline that 'every day this facility continues its lawless amnesty operations is another day an American loses his or her job, is another day an American doesn’t get the pay raise because lower-wage workers are available, is another day their tax bill is heavier because they’re funding illegal benefits for people who have no legal right to claim them.'

Sanchez is scoring at such a prolific rate he would eclipse even Henry in full flow. His late winner was his 14th in his last 18 games for Arsene Wenger’s team and completely transformed the mood of a frustrating night. He is a worthy heir to Henry’s mask and cape.

Fraser Forster performed superbly in the Southampton goal, reaching out his giant paws to produce save upon save, the best to keep out a looping header from Giroud. A minute later, however, Forster was beaten as his defensive shield tired and made a rare mistake. They were down to 10 men having lost Toby Alderweireld to injury after Ronald Koeman had used all his substitutes. It allowed Aaron Ramsey to collect a stray ball in the Saints penalty area and cut it towards Sanchez, who gleefully turned it over the line. It was a shame for Forster, who did not deserve to be beaten. But a triumph of sorts for Arsenal, who have won three on the bounce after losing at home to Manchester United and have kept three clean sheets with rookie goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez in the team. Wenger confessed he was a little ‘cautious’ of declaring his problems were in the past. It was a relief to be stronger in defence, and he was grateful to have Laurent Koscielny back. But while tightening up at one end, his side seemed to lose some punch at the other, although piercing Southampton’s defensive shield is no mean feat. This was only the 10th goal they have conceded in 14 games. They are the best in the Barclays Premier League, superbly well-drilled and committed. Even when a first-half injury to Jack Cork had forced a reshuffle, with Alderweireld moving from central defence to midfield, they remained solid while dangerous on the break.

Southampton were dealt a blow midway through the first half when midfielder Jack Cork (bottom) pulled up with a hamstring injury . Cork (right) was replaced by defender Maya Yoshida (centre) as Toby Alderweireld was moved into central midfield from centre back . ‘We were unlucky with the injuries,’ said Koeman. ‘That gave Arsenal the motivation to carry on until the last second. Fraser Forster was outstanding but it not enough. That’s the risk in football. A lot of players are having hamstring problems. When it’s a kick maybe you can ask a player for five minutes more but it was a hamstring and you can’t continue as a player.’ It is a third game without a win for the Saints and the temptation is to think their bubble has burst. Next up are Manchester United, at St Mary’s on Monday, but Wenger said: ‘Don’t bury them too quickly. They are a good side. You have to count with Southampton for the top four. ‘Up front they are quick to come out, up front always first on the ball. They play in a very intelligent way. You always see they are a threat.’ Having won here in the Capital One Cup in September, Southampton arrived with confidence and Koeman’s fluent team did not take long to open up Arsenal. Graziano Pelle and Steven Davis linked up neatly on the edge of the penalty area to create a clear chance for the Italian but his volley soared over. Koeman claimed it was the best chance of the half, although Welbeck had already missed one just as good. Santi Cazorla unzipped the defence for Welbeck who, having been restored to a central role with fit-again Giroud resting on the bench, swept the ball wide. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) battled his way into the Southampton box before firing a backheel shot towards goal . Unfortunately for the 23-year-old (centre) he can only watch on as his strike fails to find the back of the net . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was denied by Forster and a slip by Maya Yoshida, soon after coming on nearly proved costly. Welbeck, however, was unable to convert an ambitious back-heel from a tight angle. Forster made a reflex save to deny Welbeck in stoppage time at the end of the first-half. Welbeck’s glancing header from a free-kick swung in from the left by Sanchez, hit Alderweireld and deflected towards goal. It was directly at Forster, but the England goalkeeper had to be quick to turn it over. Koscielny produced a smart block to thwart Pelle soon after the restart and Shane Long darted clear on the right only to miss the goal by some considerable distance. Welbeck was soon in the thick of the action before half-time when he saw his fine header denied by man-of-the-match Forster . Forster (right) lept up brilliantly to tip over Welbeck's effort up and over his crossbar in the first half . The England international (centre) was brilliant throughout the match, this time denying Aaron Ramsey in the second half (right) Arsenal were far more direct and threatening once Giroud was sent on for the last 25 minutes. Up went the pressure on Forster’s goal but the England keeper only increased in stature and confidence. He beat away a sweet volley by Giroud at his near post and then made another splendid reaction save from Welbeck, throwing out a strong left hand and clawing the ball out. Cazorla fired high and Wenger climbed to his feet as Arsenal fans roared on their side in search of a winner. Aware that Chelsea were winning across the capital, they did not want to surrender more ground at the top of the table, but it was heading that way until Sanchez pounced. ‘He has such desire to fight and find something special to get the goal,’ said Wenger. ‘We are in December and he only arrived in July.

After City announced reduced annual losses of £22.9million and chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak spoke about the lavish spending coming to an end, it was one of their more extravagant buys who laid that jinx to rest. Sergio Aguero cost £38m but, as he continues to justify comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo and his close friend Lionel Messi, the Argentina striker looks like an absolute steal. Aguero scored two goals — one a blockbuster — and set up another. The Premier League’s top scorer now has 19 goals in all competitions this season. Manager Manuel Pellegrini, who has now overseen four straight wins in all competitions, said: ‘Finally we win here. We played very well and we’re returning to the form we had last season.’ Pellegrini confirmed that captain Vincent Kompany has only an outside chance of making next week’s Champions League decider against Roma following scans on his hamstring. In the absence of Kompany and the suspended Eliaquim Mangala, Dedryck Boyata made his first Premier League appearance in a year.

Sunderland boss Gus Poyet also made a switch in central defence as he rested Wes Brown and gave Sebastian Coates his first League start since arriving on loan from Liverpool in the summer. Both changes contributed to two goals in the space of three first-half minutes. Sunderland had been the only team to really threaten up to that point when Pablo Zabaleta blocked an effort from former City midfielder Jack Rodwell. Zabaleta was not so fortunate in the 19th minute as Connor Wickham — who terrorised City with both goals in a 2-2 draw at the Etihad in April that almost cost them the title — opened the scoring. Boyata had lost track of his man when Seb Larsson’s clever reverse pass picked out Wickham, who took it in his stride with a neat first touch. There was still plenty of work to do with Boyata on one shoulder, Zabaleta on the other and Joe Hart racing off his line. Zabaleta made a last, desperate attempt to win the ball with a sliding tackle but only succeeded in playing it against Wickham’s right leg and it bobbled past Hart into the corner.

VIDEO Premier League is well within our grasp - Aguero . Sunderland 1, City 0 had a horribly familiar ring about it for the champions, but they rallied and were level almost straightaway. Coates will not want to see too many replays of the equaliser, however. Aguero appeared to have lost control of the ball when he took an uncharacteristically heavy touch to collect Stevan Jovetic’s short pass, but Coates hesitated rather than committing himself to a challenge. The City striker slipped the ball through the Uruguyan’s legs and suddenly had a clear sight of goal from 20 yards. Ex-City keeper Costel Pantilimon must have known what was coming next, but the strike was stunning in its ferocity even by Aguero’s standards — flying into the net off his right boot. Having demonstrated his power, Aguero then produced some quite wonderful panache to set up the second for Jovetic six minutes before half time. Yaya Toure drilled a pass into his teammate, who was being closely marshalled by Coates and John O’Shea. City right back Pablo Zabaleta celebrates his second half goal, City's third, with a gesture to his pregnant wife Christel . Zabaleta married long-time girlfriend Christel, from Spain, in the summer and the couple are due to have a baby . Zabaleta waits for Pantilimon to go down and calmly dinks his shot over the keeper for a finish any striker would be delighted with . Unfortunately for Sunderland, that meant Jovetic was unmarked and Aguero knew it. He used the weight of the pass to spin the ball into his teammate’s path with a flick of his right foot. Jovetic let it bounce once and then rifled it through Pantilimon’s legs. The gulf in class between the two teams was clear again when Zabaleta got City’s third 10 minutes into the second half. Again Coates stood off his man as Samir Nasri teased the defender on the righthand side of the box before cheekily lifting the ball into the path of Zabaleta. The Argentina defender then produced an even better touch, dinking the ball over Pantilimon and just inside the post. Zabaleta celebrated the news that his wife is five months pregnant by putting the ball up his shirt and sucking his thumb like a dummy. The jeers from the Sunderland supporters suggested they did not share his joy at that particular moment. But this was the Aguero show and he struck again in the 71st minute, getting away from Santiago Vergini to meet James Milner’s pass and guide it past Pantilimon for his second and City’s fourth. ‘I was hoping Aguero would have a rest today,’ lamented Poyet. ‘Without him, it would have been a different game. ‘ . The striker was substituted soon after scoring his second and no wonder. On this form, City must protect Aguero like the Crown Jewels.

"Those hoping that the Scottish Premiership might masquerade as something other than a one-horse race well into the New Year seem set to be disappointed. This victory for the champions, while by no means perfunctory, was the kind you normally associate with sides that are well in the groove. Few would anticipate the wheels coming off the bogie any time soon. Not for the first time this season, Ronny Deila’s side made rather a meal of getting the job done but win they did. Again.

Van Dijk shoots past the helpless Partick keeper from close range to give Celtic the lead .

Referee: Brian Colvin . Virgil van Dijk’s messy goal on the hour mark was enough to take the points although Celtic were again thankful for the diligence of Craig Gordon in denying Thistle sub Kris Doolan’s spectacular late effort. Since losing to Hamilton on home soil in early October, Deila’s men have now racked up eight straight domestic victories to keep themselves alive on every front. If they are able to extend that happy sequence over the Festive period, the countdown to the clinching of a fourth successive title will begin. Van Dijk’s third goal in two games may have been the defining moment but the contribution of Aleksander Tonev was equally as eye-catching. Later today, the Bulgarian’s appeal over a seven-game ban for using racist language against Aberdeen defender Shay Logan will be heard at Hampden and frankly, up until this point, you had to wonder how much Celtic would miss him if that failed. This was different, though. Energised, direct and focused, the on-loan Aston Villa player looked anything other than a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. One who looks capable of belatedly doing something at Celtic – if he’s given the opportunity. It was the home side who got down to the business of working a goalkeeper first with Paul Gallacher denying John Guidetti a 12th goal in as many starts with a finger-tip save after the Swede had risen to head Stefan Johansen’s cross goalward. The Dutch defender is congratulated by Aleksander Tonev as Partick Thistle's resistance is finally broken . Craig Gordon pulled off a brilliant save low down to his right to deny Partick a late equaliser . Celtic's Emilio Izaguirre (right) heads the ball as Kallum Higginbotham raises his boot to try and win it . Hopeful that an early goal might see Thistle collapse like a pack of cards, van Dijk fizzed a 25-yarder on target but Gallacher proved up to the challenge. Fresh from a convincing Scottish Cup win over Hamilton, the Maryhill men were not without their moments and Stephen O’Donnell will doubtless feel he should have done better with a shot from inside the box. As the clock registered 30 minutes, Thistle found the width of the crossbar separating them from a slender lead. Stuart Bannigan’s in-swinging free-kick was claimed by the formidable figure of Abdul Osman and Gordon looked mighty relieved as the Englishman’s header clipped the woodwork on its way over. Chances for Celtic remained plentiful. Johansen forced Gallacher into another smart block after latching onto Van Dijk’s superb ball over the top, before the Dutchman fired into the ground and over from Tonev’s centre. Adam Matthews lashed a meaty volley two yards wide but if there was forgiveness for the Welshman from the home support on that occasion, Anthony Stokes felt their wrath with two poor misses in the closing moments of the first half. Celtic's John Guidetti is just beaten to the ball by Partick Thistle's Paul Gallacher . Guidetti and Partick Thistle's Aaron Muirhead battle for the ball during the match at Celtic Park . The first one was glaring. Guidetti was beaten to a loose ball by the advanced Gallacher only for Scott Brown to pick up the scraps and recycle the ball to Stokes. Even though two Partick players had regrouped on the line, the Irishman’s inability to hit the target from 15 yards was unforgiveable. Before the groans had subsided, Stokes played a perfect one-two with Tonev yet, having done the hard part, then overran the ball. But just when Celtic - by this time with Nir Bitton on for the stricken Charlie Mulgrew – were beginning to test the patience of their fans, they struck. Brown won a foul on the right which the dependable Johansen dropped in between the Thistle central defenders. The unfortunate Aaron Muirhead, the deepest of the visitors, was unable to adjust his footing and the ball squirmed to Van Dijk who dispatched it high beyond Gallacher.

Doolan was immediately sprung from the Thistle bench and worried Gordon with a cute angled header that went narrowly wide. Kris Commons and Stefan Scepovic joined the fray and both missed early opportunities to put the game to bed. Picked out by Stokes’ cut-back, Commons became the latest man to find Gallacher in fine form. Scepovic didn’t work the Thistle man but ought to have when pouncing on a loose ball eight yards from goal. As news of Rangers’ remarkable collapse at Alloa reverberated around the stadium, Celtic momentarily lost their way. Doolan’s remarkable scissor-kick forced Gordon into the save of the match and with it the points remained in the East End.","Van Dijk grabbed the only goal of the game after 60 minutes .

"One of Nasa's experimental research craft has been spotted on an African runway amid claims it is being used to create high resolution 3D maps to fight terrorism. Satellite images confirm the WB-57 aircraft was on an American military airstrip in eastern Africa a few weeks ago. However, officials have refused to reveal what it was doing there. Scroll down for video . The WB-57 is a mid-wing, long-range aircraft capable of operation for extended periods of time from sea level to altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet. The WB-57 was spotted by Google Earth satellites at an airfield in Djibouti in September . The WB-57 is a mid-wing, long-range aircraft capable of operation for extended periods of time from sea level to altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet. Two crew members are positioned at separate tandem stations in the forward section of the fuselage. The pilot station contains all the essential equipment for flying the aircraft while the sensor equipment operator (SEO) station contains both navigational equipment and controls for the operation of the payloads that are located throughout the aircraft. The WB-57 can fly for approximately 6.5 hours, has a range of approximately 2500 miles, and can carry up to 8,800 lbs of payload. A Nasa official confirmed the sighting. 'I really can't give you any of the details,' Jim Alexander, a Nasa official with the WB-57 High Altitude Research Program, told ABC News. 'You know, the airplane was there, you see it in the picture. But I really can't tell you what it was for.' According to Nasa, the WB-57 Program provides 'unique, high-altitude airborne platforms to US Government agencies, academic institutions, and commercial customers in order to support scientific research and advanced technology development and testing at locations around the world.' Mission examples include atmospheric and earth science, ground mapping, cosmic dust collection, rocket launch support, and test bed operations for future airborne or spaceborne systems. Digital Globe satellite imagery of the U.S. military base at Camp Lemmonier in Djibouti, dated Sept. 20, depicts NASA’s WB-57 high-altitude aircraft on the recently-expanded auxiliary operations apron. 'The question is—why? What purpose does a scientific research plane have in visiting America’s main military outpost in Africa? One possible answer is … making maps for commando raids,' said Chris Biggers, writing on Medium. 'We know from the Next-Generation Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance Conference in Virginia in June that the HALOE sensor had already begun mapping territory for U.S. Africa Command.' KANDAHAR AIRFIELD-  JANUARY 24, 2014:  DigitalGlobe image of some planes at the Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan. The Air Force released this image in 2011 to show the kind of maps the HALOe sensor believed to have been used on the experimental craft can create. According to the presentation by the Army’s Geospatial Center, the sensor mapped more than 13,500 square kilometers in July and August 2013 - but does not say which aircraft. Biggers says the move could mean the U.S. is mapping more urban environments to create 3-D maps to help battle planners. 'Such mapping could prove useful to American commandos fighting groups like Somalia’s Al Shabab or Boko Haram in Nigeria,' he says. A Nasa website that tracks the agency's three WB-57s shows that one of its planes, number 926, was on a 'foreign deployment' from July to November this year. A Nasa website that tracks the agency's three WB-57s shows that one of its planes, number 926, was on a 'foreign deployment' from July to November this year. AFRICOM, the U.S. military's Africa Command, would only say that 'aircraft from a variety of agencies and nations perform diverse missions from Camp Lemmonier in support of U.S. and allied military peace and security operations in the region, which spans East Africa and the Mideast.' One previous mission was described by Arati Prabhakar, the head of the military's fringe-tech specialists at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, to the House subcommittee on Intelligence earlier this year as a kind of mass, three-dimensional terrain mapping. It used a sensor called HALOE - High-Altitude LIDAR Operations Experiment. The WB-57 can fly for approximately 6.5 hours, has a range of approximately 2500 miles, and can carry up to 8,800 lbs of payload. The plane can be fitted with a variety of sensors that could create 3D terrain maps. This uses light from a 'pulsed laser' to create 'precise, three-dimensional information about the shape of the Earth and its surface characteristics,' according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 'HALOE provided forces in Afghanistan with unprecedented access to high-resolution 3D data, and it collected orders of magnitude faster and from much longer ranges than conventional methods,' Prabhakar said, according to written testimony. Given 90 days, Prabhakar said she was confident the system could've mapped half the country. 'At full operational capacity, HALOE could enable mapping of 50 percent of Afghanistan in 90 days. 'State-of-the-art deployed systems would have required 3 years to accomplish that task, and more conventional systems would have required 30 years.' The HALOE sensor pod was initially integrated onto a WB-57 aircraft and deployed to Afghanistan from November 2010 through August 2011 in a joint effort with the Army Geospatial Center (AGC).' 'During this time, over 70,000 square kilometers of terrain data (about 10 percent of Afghanistan) were collected, reflecting the priorities of operational units,' Prabhakar said . According to Nasa, all three WB-57s are now back in the U.S., with their status listed as 'inactive.'","WB-57 has previously created 3D terrain maps in Afghanistan .

"It's been at the forefront of British politics for months. And last night the issue of Scottish Independence weighed heavy on the hearts of British TV stars too, as the nation's favourite actors lined up  for the premier of the latest series of Downton Abbey.

'But I feel quite strongly this is a matter for the people of Scotland and, you know, we keep harrying them from down here and telling them what they can't have if they vote this way and so on. 'I think we should leave them alone to come to their decision. You know, I wish at the beginning we'd said we will discuss all the terms if and when you vote for independence, we hope you don't.' Lesley Nicol, who plays Mrs Patmore the cook, was less sure on the matter. 'I don't know. If I was Scottish , I'm half Scottish, but I'm not fully Scottish so I think it's very different if you live up there so I don't think I'm the person to comment on it.' Laura Carmichael, who plays the unlucky-in-love Lady Edith, admitted: 'I don't know... I don't know really,' while Jim Carter, the face of the grumpy butler Carson, was even less forthcoming.

"My outfit had been chosen carefully — a beautiful deep pink and purple top and smart black trousers. Never had I been so excited about attending a party. All my friends would be there, my ‘gang’ of the past eight years. We had so much news to share. After months away, I hoped they’d be as excited to see me, as I was to see them. I was just putting on my make-up, when a cursory glance at my email stopped me in my tracks. It said: ‘If you come tonight, we will leave.’ The message was from a woman I’d been friends with for years. Prejudice: Mary feels let down by friends who were hostile towards her when she returned from weeks nursing Ebola victims in Liberia . ‘Not everyone accepts that you’re not a risk and we think it’s best if you don’t return to the group for another two months.’ The hostility was like a slap in the face, and tears soon followed. I cancelled my plans and the blouse was consigned to the back of my wardrobe. What had I done to deserve this cruel treatment from the people I loved dearly? The truth will shock you: I am a nurse with the international relief group, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), and had just returned from Monrovia, capital of Liberia in West Africa, where I’d spent weeks nursing Ebola victims. On duty: Mary in protective gear . If dealing with the daily horror of this terrible disease wasn’t difficult enough, the ignorance, prejudice and paranoia of people back home — the very people whose generosity these sufferers are dependent on — has stunned me. I just hope it doesn’t deter other volunteers from going out to help. I’d been extremely careful since my return three weeks ago. Although my chances of developing the virus were minuscule due to MSF’s meticulous hygiene procedures, I didn’t want to worry people. So I stayed at home until the incubation period passed and I had a certificate of all-clear from Public Health England. It just so happened that my ‘release date’ coincided with the party — a party I’d now been effectively barred from. I’d grown used to some of my friends and family thinking I was mad for working in such terrible conditions when, as a trained nurse and midwife, I could just get a job in a local hospital. I’d started going on aid missions in 1998. I didn’t want accolades, I just wanted to do my bit and as a single woman with few obligations, I felt I should. During the past 16 years I’ve been to some of the world’s most difficult areas: Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Sudan, and most recently, Liberia. I’ve survived warzones, had a gun held to my head, almost died from typhoid, contracted malaria and witnessed unspeakable suffering. Yet I’d never felt as hurt as I did in that moment. In Monrovia, I’d spent six weeks in the largest Ebola centre the world has seen. While I was away I was unaware of the fear that had disseminated across the UK, leaving people panicking that Britain, too, was about to be gripped by an Ebola outbreak. It doesn’t matter how often you reassure people, those images of sick and dying children remain fixed in their minds. Some of my MSF colleagues have reported the same reaction from their communities. One doctor, who’d previously been praised for going on aid missions, returned from West Africa to find he was now viewed as a threat. During the past 16 years Mary has been to some of the world’s most difficult areas: Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Sudan, and most recently, Liberia . And a recent news story revealed how a healthy nine-year-old boy, who had recently been in Sierra Leone with his aid-worker mother, was banned from attending a school in Stockport amid parents’ fears about their children catching ebola, despite the fact he’d been screened by the Health Protection Agency. The fears are completely unfounded. Infection control measures with MSF were paramount. Touching infected patients was forbidden and we were instructed to keep at least two metres apart from staff, patients and visitors. It went against all my instincts. As a nurse, I wanted to reach out to people, to comfort them, especially women in the throes of labour as well as ebola, but I knew I couldn’t risk breaching the strict rules in place. Mary worked 12-hour days with only three days off and was looking forward to relaxing with her friends when she returned . Yet among the many harrowing scenes there were positive moments. One young man called Orlando was carried, critically ill, into the tent where I was working. His eyes had the awful ‘ebola look’ I came to recognise — extreme fatigue combined with primal fear. Yet a few weeks later, he walked out proudly clutching his survivor’s recovery certificate. Unfortunately, survivors often faced onward battles. Many were driven home to their villages in an MSF car, only to be treated as outcasts. I had no idea I was about to get a taste of this myself. I’d worked 12-hour days with only three days off and was looking forward to relaxing over a few lattes and catching up on news and much needed hugs. If only! Shortly before departure, I received my first inkling of the stigma to come. An email from my two lodgers at my home near Barnstaple in Devon, informed me they would be moving out for three weeks. It was nothing personal, they said, they’d been instructed by their workplace to avoid me. I knew the fears were unfounded, as ebola is spread only by the bodily fluids of an infected person, but I respected their decision. Official guidelines from Public Health England said isolation wasn’t necessary, but I wanted to prove I wasn’t a threat. I took my temperature twice a day and a close friend agreed to be on standby to drive me to an isolation unit, in the highly unlikely event of me becoming unwell. Shortly into my self-imposed quarantine, I spoke to a doctor friend on the phone. ‘Who’s taking your temperature?’ he questioned. ‘I’m taking it myself,’ I replied. ‘Well, you could easily fudge that!’ he retorted. I was incensed. Why would anyone think I’d deliberately put anyone’s life at risk by falsifying my temperature readings. I explained I had to be symptomatic to be contagious, but he saw no need to apologise. Mary knew her friends' fears were unfounded, as ebola is spread only by the bodily fluids of an infected person . His comments really stung. I couldn’t believe it — especially from a medical professional. Another aid worker I know was told she couldn’t pick up her grandchildren from school. I haven’t returned to the group who excluded me from the party, because while the majority are happy to accept me, some have made it clear they would still walk out. I just wish they’d pick up the phone instead of hiding behind an email. Because the only way to combat ignorance and panic is through true scientific facts. Her experience has given Mary an insight into the plight of many ebola survivors who are shunned by their own communities . Unexpectedly, all this has given me an insight into the plight of many ebola survivors. My suffering is nothing compared to theirs, but I can now identify in a small way with their rejection. I’m planning to return to Liberia this month and I’ll feel honoured to share their experiences. MSF have provided amazing emotional support and I have some loyal friends, too. Liberian survivors aren’t nearly so fortunate. I won’t let people’s ignorance stop me, but next time I come home I won’t be crushed by their attitudes. This experience has flushed out my true friends from those who just pay lip service.","Mary Houldsworth's  friends were hostile when she returned from Liberia .

"For Ally McCoist, cups have a tendency to turn into poisoned chalices. But in a lengthy roll of dishonour in knockout competitions during his time at the helm at Rangers, this defeat against Alloa last night was just about as bad as it has ever been for the beleaguered Ibrox boss. As Alloa celebrated their first-ever win over Rangers in their history, the theme tune from the A-Team blared out across the Indrodrill Stadium. To widespread astonishment, the plucky part-timers had come back from the dead: 2-0 down to win 3-2 and reach the final of the Challenge Cup. But having presided over the most unlikely transformation since BA Baracus and co entered a shed armed with a couple of pipe cleaners and some bolts only to emerge with a fully kitted out armoured car, the sad truth for Rangers here was that they had actually just lost to Alloa's B-Team.

'Any more injuries and I think I might get a game,' sighed Wasps chairman Mike Mulraney before kick-off. But still they beat a Rangers side who plumbed fresh depths at the Indodrill Stadium despite taking what looked an unassailable lead thanks to goals from Kenny Miller and Dean Shiels. But two goals in 120 seconds from Greig Spence and then Ryan McCord had Alloa level, quite astonishingly. A fine winner from Spence merely left the Ibrox players, management staff and fans floored. Spence had set up the winner for John Baird for Raith Rovers in the Ramsdens Cup  against Rangers earlier this year. McCoist had rated that as his lowest moment on the park during his side's climb up the leagues but last night's loss will surely rival it. And on a dark night for Rangers, McCoist also suffered the added ignominy of losing his best player this season, Lewis Macleod, to what looked a nasty hamstring injury. He now faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines. While Alloa struggled to field a fit team, McCoist, by stark contrast, had big-earners like John Daly, David Templeton, and Dean Shiels among his substitutes. Daly's position on the bench was due to McCoist promoting Kris Boyd back into his starting line-up after dropping him for the last two matches. Boyd, of course, netted against former club Kilmarnock within 90 seconds of coming on as a substitute in the 3-0 Scottish Cup win on Sunday.

Dean Shiels (centre) celebrates putting Rangers 2-0 up but it all went downhill for them after that . But Alloa could have been 3-0 up at half time. Spence missed a terrific chance when he miskicked in front of goal after a clever freekick was knocked down by Ben Gordon. Then Adam Asghar, on his full debut, hit a 25-yarder that skidded past Steve Simonsen's left post after Miller was robbed in possession. The best Rangers could muster in the early stages was a Nicky Law shot from distance that posed no trouble to Craig McDowall and an Ian Black shot that struck Boyd on the back. Then Simonsen had to run to the edge of his box to rescue Bilel Mohsni after the big defender misjudged a lofted through ball towards Ryan McCord. Then the normally deadly Liam Buchanan squandered a great chance from ten yards, shanking wide with just Simonsen to beat. In just 45 minutes, Alloa had created three more chances than Kilmarnock mustered on Sunday at Ibrox. Alloa's Michael Doyle (left) challenges Bilel Mohsni (centre) of Rangers for possession of the ball . This was not at all going to plan for McCoist and his players but they emerged from what was surely a rollicking and were a different outfit after the break. At the start, at least. The Ibrox side was ahead on 49 minutes when Boyd's freekick was saved by McDowall and Miller was there to fire the loose ball home from ten yards. Darren McGregor then forced a fine save from McDowall, but a second goal arrived when Ian Black found Miller, who set up Dean Shields to curl a low shot beyond McDowall from the edge of the area. Game over, Rangers were on easy street. Or so they thought. But two goals in two sensational minutes utterly changed all that. First, Docherty chipped the ball back in and Spence headed into the net. Then substitute Eddie Ferns set up the outstanding Ryan McCord for an unlikely leveller to leave Rangers stunned. Ally McCoist is falling under further pressure as Rangers manager after his semi-final defeat . Alloa keeper McDowall saved spectacularly from substitute Daly before Steven Hetherington set up Spence for a fabulous winner. The part-timers now faces Livingston in the final next April, dreaming of winning the cup for the first time since 1999. Smith danced in the home dugout like Hannibal Smith, the Alloa boss loves it when a plan comes together. He can claim this was no fluke. Three times this season his side has faced Rangers and they are yet to lose – drawing 1-1 home and away in the Championship. For Ally McCoist, however, after this latest sting in the tail from the Wasps, the coming days will surely see the Ibrox legend face fresh calls for his head in a season that also sees them trail Hearts in the league by nine points.","Rangers took a 2-0 lead at Alloa and appeared to have the game safe .

"Two Maryland men have been charged with raping a 16-year-old girl at a Johns Hopkins University fraternity party. Chaz Haggins, 20, and Ethan Turner, 19, both of Reisterstown, were arrested on charges of rape and sexual assault stemming from the alleged attack at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon party in the early morning of November 2. They were being held without bail at the Baltimore City Detention Center. Two Maryland men have been charged with raping a 16-year-old girl at a Johns Hopkins University fraternity party. Pictured: Chaz Haggins, 20, (left) and Ethan Turner, 19, (right) both of Reisterstown . Their arrests follow a report by a 16-year-old girl who told police that two men forced her to perform sex acts before they raped her at the party. Haggins and Turner are not members of the fraternity, nor are they students at Johns Hopkins, university spokesman Dennis O'Shea said. O'Shea said the school was pleased with the arrests and is fully cooperating with the criminal investigation. The university has launched its own internal investigation, he said. The alleged attack happened at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon (pictured) party the early morning of November 2 . The fraternity has been suspended pending the investigation and is working with the leadership at all campus fraternities to ensure 'the safety and well-being of attendees at their social events,' O'Shea said in a statement. The fraternity said in a statement on its website that its national headquarters was also investigating the allegations. While noting the alleged attackers aren't members of the fraternity, 'any form of assault or sexual misconduct is unacceptable, and we will not tolerate actions that are inconsistent with our values,' the statement said. No attorneys were listed for Haggins or Turner in court records. Johns Hopkins has been under federal investigation for its handling of sexual assault complaints. In the spring of 2013, the university failed to promptly notify students of a rape reported at the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house. Students filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, and the university is one of dozens around the country being investigated for complaints over how they responded to reports of sexual assault.","Chaz Haggins, 20, and Ethan Turner, 19, both of Reisterstown, were arrested on charges of rape and sexual assault .

"James Kiddie lost his appeal against the conviction for attacking the woman in court today . A police officer who was filmed dragging a woman by the hair and punching her three times in the head has lost his appeal against the conviction for assault. James Kiddie was branded 'dishonest' and 'scheming' by a judge after claiming the woman, Sarah Reed, had provoked his behaviour by biting him. The 45-year-old Metropolitan Police officer was convicted of the assault in March at Westminster Magistrates' Court. He was given a 12-month community order and told to complete 150 hours of community service in addition to paying £500 in costs. But the father-of-two appealed the conviction, claiming Miss Reed had threatened him with violence before he attacked her in the office at Uniqlo in Regent Street, London, in November 2012. Today a judge rejected his version of events after it emerged he had tried to convince a witness to corroborate his claims. In the video, forces the woman back into a chair before grabbing her head and dragging her by the hair on the floor. He is then seen to punch her in the head three times as she lies cowering with her arms in front of her face. Today, Mr Recorder Paul Taylor told the disgraced officer: ‘The appellant we found to be dishonest, scheming and to exaggerate. 'Watching the video it was clear that Miss Reed never made any movement which he could construe as threatening and in fact there was evidence undermining the claim he felt threatened on the video itself. ‘For example he went through the handbag of Miss Reed on the floor in a position where if Miss Reed had wanted to assault him she had the ideal opportunity. ‘The fact that he was willing to look through the bag in that position speaks volumes.’ Scroll down for video . The former police officer was filmed attacking Sarah Reed in an office at Uniqlo in Regent Street, London, after being called to the shop where Miss Reed had been accused of shoplifting in November 2012 . The 45-year-old is filmed suddenly grabbing her by the head and throwing her on the floor as she struggles against his grip . Kiddie drags the woman by her hair out of the office and into the shop's staff corridor where employees are seen watching the incident unfold . During his trial, Kiddie claimed the woman bit his finger and told him she had AIDS. Pointing to the CCTV footage, Kiddie had said: ‘She is now biting into my index finger and she’s telling me she’s got the AIDS virus.’ ‘I didn’t want to break a lady’s nose... I didn’t want to hurt her somewhere that is going to damage,’ he said. But today Judge Taylor said the claim the man felt threatened was unfounded, rejecting claims the woman told him she had AIDS as a witness would have heard it. 'We also noted that he took phone calls at a time when he claims he felt under threat. ‘The fact that he did not call for back-up also supports the prosecution’s case that his claim that he felt threatened is one which is simply untrue. ‘We find that the escalation in this situation was largely caused by the appellant. ‘Grabbing somebody by the hair and pulling them off their feet and throwing them down is likely to cause anybody to act aggressively although in fact she did not. ‘There may have been some contact between his hand and the teeth of Miss Reed but he has exaggerated beyond all recognition of what really happened.’ He added Kiddie’s attempt to manipulate a witness’s account was ‘scheming’. The policeman will face a misconduct hearing in November over the incident which took place when Miss Reed was accused of shoplifting . Standing over her with a clenched fist Kiddie launches another punch towards the woman's head . With his knee in the 30-year-old's back, Kiddie keeps one hand on her head to stop her from getting back up . He sits on top of the woman as she lies limply on the floor in the corrider, putting handcuffs around her wrists . ‘That is an indictment of a man who was trying to find a way out of behaviour which he knew had been badly wrong,’ said Judge Taylor. Kiddie had also dramatically changed his accounts after initially claiming Ms Reed was ‘spitting all the time’ and saying ‘there were bits of phlegm going everywhere’. He claimed his punches were launched with ‘half-power’ with the fleshy part of his hand. Judge Taylor concluded Kiddie’s actions were neither ‘necessary, proportionate or reasonable’. He will face a misconduct hearing in November.","James Kiddie was filmed punching Sarah Reed in face three times .

"The lesbian parents of an 11-year-old boy who is undergoing the process of becoming a girl last night defended the decision, claiming it was better for a child to have a sex change when young. Thomas Lobel, who now calls himself Tammy, is undergoing controversial hormone blocking treatment in Berkeley, California to stop him going through puberty as a boy. But Pauline Moreno and Debra Lobel warn that children with gender identity disorder forced to postpone transitioning could face a higher risk of suicide. Scroll down for video . Therapy: Thomas Lobel, who now calls himself Tammy, is undergoing controversial hormone blocking treatment . No pressure: The boy's two lesbian adopted mothers, Debra, left, and Pauline, right, say that they have not forced their son to become a girl . The mothers say that one of the first . things Thomas told them when he learned sign language aged three - because of a speech impediment - was, 'I am a girl'. At age seven, after threatening . genital mutilation on himself, psychiatrists diagnosed Thomas with gender identity disorder. By the age of eight, he began . transitioning. This summer, he started taking hormone-blocking drugs, which will stop him from experiencing puberty. The hormone-suppressant, implanted in his upper left arm, will postpone the 11-year-old developing broad shoulders, deep voice and facial hair. The couple faced intense criticism from friends and family as a result, Ms Moreno told MailOnline. 'Everybody was angry with us. ""How could you be doing this? You might be ruining his whole life!"" Citing a statistic from the Youth Suicide . Prevention Program, Ms Moreno noted over 50 per cent of transgender youth will have had . at least one suicide attempt by their 20th birthday. PROUD MOM: Two photos of Tammy from one of Pauline's Facebook albums called 'My Sweet Sweet Princess' Here is Tammy with her mothers and older brother Edgar at his recent bar mitzvah. Mother Pauline said Tammy was shy and unhappy as a boy when compared to her older, outgoing brothers . Tammy favours headbands to baseball hats and picked out bras and dresses to start wearing when given choice in clothing to wear . And ignoring their son's incessant pleas, she said, simply was not worth the risk. 'What is so frightening to me is that . you would be willing to say ""no"" just because you don't like it - even . though your child could lose their life?' Her son's adolescent transition, she hopes, will help him have a less conflicted adulthood. 'The whole idea now is let's stop . creating a third (gender) that is neither one thing or the other, so we . transitioned her,' said Ms Moreno. 'The protocol now is . to transition these children as soon as you can make a diagnosis, . because otherwise they end up being not one thing or the other... because they experienced puberty.' Tammy Lobel's hormones are being blocked by an implant on the inside of the 11-year-old's upper left arm, which must be replaced once a year. Ms Moreno explained: 'In other words, she will stay as a pre-pubescent boy until she decides and we feel that she can make this decision about surgery.' His parents say the hormone treatment will give him time to figure out if he wants to fully transition to being female or go through puberty as a boy. By age 14 or 15 the device will need to be removed so that Tammy can go through puberty, Ms Moreno said. If he chooses to stop taking the drugs, he will undergo natural male puberty at a later stage and his future fertility would not be impacted. Should their son decide to transition to an adult female, he can take female hormones as well, which would raise his voice, allow him to grow breasts and develop other feminine physical characteristics. Ms Moreno recalled the first step of Thomas' transition to becoming female by letting him pick his own clothes. He favoured headbands to baseball . hats and picked out bras and dresses to start wearing when given choice . in clothing to wear. And the change in his personality, Ms Moreno says, . was instant. 'He was in his own world just . completely detached and that was a problem we always had was getting . Thomas to participate in life,' she said. 'What we saw emerge when Tammy . was allowed to be Tammy is, ""Whoa!""... It was an immediate . transformation. She was so giggly and she was now interacting she was . now making it a point to defend herself.' The diagnosis has been hard to accept for Tammy's parents. The couple were married in 1990 by a . rabbi and have two older sons and grandchildren. But they insist their . sexuality has nothing to do with it. 'It was odd to us,' she said. 'Even . though she has lesbians as parents, this is all new to us in every . possible way. We know what it's like to feel different - we've got that . one. But to feel like you're not in the right body was just something we . could not put our heads around.' Fortunately, the family has a vast support system. The couple credits Tammy's teachers and officials at Children's Learning Center in Alameda, California, and their religious community, for being open-minded about their son's decision. 'We live in the Bay area where lots of alternative lifestyles are in place... and we belong to a religious community that was incredibly supportive. They make it a point when we're in synagogue to come over and tell Tammy, ""Oh, you look so pretty today,' Ms Moreno said, adding, 'There's never going to be enough gratitude for them.' His parents say the hormone treatment . will give him time to figure out if he wants to fully transition to . being female or go through puberty as a boy. If he chooses to stop taking the . drugs, he will undergo natural male puberty at a later stage and his . future fertility would not be impacted.

"The sun’s magnetic field is expected to flip in the next three to four months and it could lead to changes in our climate, storms and disruption to satellites. This solar event only happens once every 11 years and signals what physicists call the Solar Maximum - a time when the Sun's solar activity is at its highest. During this peak in activity the outbursts of solar energy can increase the amount of cosmic and UV rays coming towards Earth and this can interfere with radio communications, cause solar bursts of light - known as flares - and can affect the planet's temperature. Physicists from Stanford University believe the Sun's magnetic fields will flip before the end of the year, reversing their polarity. This will cause an increase in solar energy and could lead to changes in climate and satellite disruption. The reversal happens once every 11 years or so . During the sun's cycle the amount of solar activity reaches peaks and troughs known as Solar Maximum and Solar Minimum. During Solar Maximum the amount of solar activity is at its highest due to a flip, or reversal, of the sun's magnetic field. Since 1976 there have been three Solar Maximums and they occur roughly every 11 years, although this can vary from between nine and 14 years. During a Solar Maximum, large numbers of sunspots appear and the sun's irradiance - or electromagnetic radiation - output grows by around 0.1 per cent. This increase in energy can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns. ‘It looks like we're no more than three to four . months away from a complete field reversal,’ solar physicist Dr Todd . Hoeksema of Stanford University told Nasa Science. ‘This change will have ripple effects throughout the solar system.’ The sun’s magnetic field reverses around every 11 years at the peak of each solar cycle. The last peak, or Solar Maximum, was in 2000 and Nasa initially predicted the next flip would take place between 2011 and 2012. Physicists also warned at the time that the next Solar Maximum could be the strongest yet. Scientists at Stanford’s Wilcox Solar Observatory have been studying the sun’s magnetic field since 1976, during which time they have witnessed three reversals. In 1859 a solar storm known as the 1859 Solar Superstorm, or Carrington Event after Richard C Carrington who recorded the event, saw numerous solar flares appear all over Earth. It was so strong that the Northern . Lights - a natural light display that appears predominantly in that . Arctic and Antarctic regions and is caused by the collision of energetic . charged particles in the magnetosphere and solar wind - were said to be . have been visible as far south as Rome. During Solar Maximum the amount of solar activity is at its highest. A Solar Maximum causes large numbers of sunspots to appear. The Sun's irradiance - or electromagnetic radiation - output grows by about 0.1 per cent during this time and this can lead to changes in climate and affect radio communications . In 1859 a solar storm known as the Solar Superstorm, or Carrington Event named after Richard Carrington who . recorded it, saw numerous solar flares appear. From 28 August 28 to 2 September sunspots and solar flares were observed. British astronomer Carrington . observed the largest flare, which caused a major coronal mass ejection - . a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic field - to travel directly . toward Earth. It was so strong that the Northern . Lights - a natural light display that appears predominantly in that . Arctic and Antarctic regions caused by the collision of energetic . charged particles in the magnetosphere and solar wind - were said to be . have been visible as far south as Rome. Telegraph services were also disrupted. Solar flares created by changes in solar activity also release X-rays and UV radiation. These rays can affect Earth's ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and disrupt long-range radio communications. Dr Phil Scherrer, also a solar physicist at Stanford, explained that during a magnetic field reversal the Sun’s polar magnetic fields lose strength and then stop all together before appearing again the other way around. The increase of solar bursts have implications for a huge area; its influence extends billions of miles past Pluto. Changes in the magnetic field affect what's called the 'current sheet.' This sheet juts out for billions of miles from the Sun's equator where according to Science@Nasa, the star's slowly-rotating magnetic field includes an electric current. Although the current of electricity is small, there is a large amount flowing through a region around 10,000km thick. The heliosphere - a region of space and our solar system that is directly influenced by the Sun and its solar activity - is controlled by this sheet. When a magnetic field flips it causes the current sheet to become wavy, which Scherrer described to Science@Nasa as being like the seams on a baseball. As Earth orbits the Sun, the planet dips in and out of the sheet and these transitions can cause stormy space weather. It can also affect cosmic rays, which are particles that travel almost at light speed, and these rays can be dangerous to astronauts and space stations. Some researchers believe these rays also directly affect how cloudy Earth is. Wilcox's Solar Observatory is continuing to monitor the changes and is set to release a statement when the reversal takes place.","The sun's magnetic field reverses its polarity once every 11 years or so .

Unfortunately the well-meaning Harvester employee had mistaken him for a child – because while 26-year-old Mr Lusted, who has dwarfism, is just 3ft 7in tall, his 20-year-old fiancee Chloe Roberts towers over him at 5ft 7in. James Lusted, a 3ft 7in dwarf,  took his fiance Chloe Roberts, to a posh restaurant when he was given a children's colouring book and crayons . The waitress was left red faced after realising her mistake when she handed Mr Lusted the children's colouring book and crayons on his meal out with his fiancée . It was only when the waitress heard Mr Lusted’s deep voice that she realised her mistake. While she was covered in embarrassment, her gaffe was the highlight of the night for the couple who have been laughing about it ever since. Mr Lusted said: ‘As I said thank you to the waitress for the menu she heard my voice and knew I wasn’t a child. ‘She immediately put the colouring book behind her back in shock. But I am man enough to see the funny side – I would never take offence.’ The couple who have been together for 18 months, had been enjoying a romantic meal out when the embarrassing blunder took place . They did not complain to the Harvester in Cardiff city centre and will visit again with no hard feelings . He and Miss Roberts did not complain to the Harvester in Cardiff city centre and will visit again with no hard feelings. The couple realise they make an unusual sight when they are out together in Cardiff, where she is a third-year education student. But they say their mis-matched heights make no difference to them and they are getting married in the summer of 2016. Mr Lusted, of Colwyn Bay, North Wales, said: ‘Life has not been easy – when I was young I had a lot of surgery and went through a time of being bullied in school. ‘I have often thought from an early age, who would want to marry me, a dwarf? But then I met Chloe and everything just fell into place.’ A rare genetic condition called diastrophic dysplasia caused Mr Lusted’s dwarfism. Both his parents are of average height. He works as a TV presenter, actor and motivational speaker. He also competed in the World Dwarf Games twice and played badminton at a national level. Miss Roberts, also from Colwyn Bay, said: ‘All little girls dream about having their tall, dark and handsome Prince Charming. Never in my life did I think I’d date someone like James. ‘People sometimes get a bit confused when they see us for the first time but we always laugh it off. I felt a bit sorry for the waitress – she felt very uncomfortable.’ She added that she didn’t hesitate when Mr Lusted got down on one knee to propose. ‘There may be a two-foot height difference between us but when you are in love little things like that don’t matter,’ she said. A spokesman for Harvester said: ‘We can’t apologise enough to James and Chloe, and are happy they have taken the error in good faith.’ Diastrophic dysplasia is a rare type of dwarfism. The congenital disorder  is often characterised by short stature and with short arms and legs. It can also be associated with abnormal bone and joint development, curvature of the spine, clubfoot, cleft palate and swelling of the ear tissue. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning both mother and father must carry the defective gene for a child to inherit the condition. Parents are not normally affected by the disorder. Diastrophic dysplasia is caused by mutations in the SLC26A2 gene which alters the structure of developing cartilage, preventing bones from forming properly.","James Lusted suffers from rare diastrophic dysplasia and stands at 3ft 7in .

"The battle is on... George Clooney versus Pepper the robot. While Nespresso has the Hollywood heartthrob to promote its coffee, Nescafe has looked to the future and employed a humanoid robot to draw crowds. This month Pepper starts its role to help sell  coffee machines in home appliance stores in Japan. The sleek, all-white robot, has a tablet mounted to its chest, and can chat with customers about their coffee habits and preferences. Scroll down for video . Pepper: A fleet of robots will roll into 1,000 home electronic stores throughout Japan, where they'll help customers looking to select a Nespresso coffee maker . Although Pepper many not appear on the silver screen, she (or he) is billed as the first robot in the world that is able to read and respond to human emotion. Equipped with the latest voice and emotion recognition technology, Pepper is able to read people's facial expressions and listen to their tone of voice to analyse how they're feeling. 'Pepper will be able to explain Nescafé products and services and engage in conversation with consumers. I hope that this new consumer engagement model will expand across the world as an example of Japanese innovation' said Kohzoh Takaoka, President and CEO of Nestlé Japan. Rival: While Nespresso has Hollywood heartthrob George Clooney to promote its brand, rival Nescafe has gone one up and is now using a humanoid robot . 'The dream to create an advanced consumer experience with Pepper is now coming true. 'We hope that by providing people the opportunity to interact with a robot whilst shopping, we can help create experiences of wonder and delight for consumers' said Masayoshi Son, Chairman and CEO of SoftBank Corporation. Engineers claim that the robot, which retails at 198,000 yen ($1,650), can understand 80 percent of conversations and has the ability to learn from conversations. The technology will 'help us discover consumer needs through conversations between our customers and Pepper,' said a joint statement from Nestle and SoftBank, whose French operation Aldebaran developed the robot. Nestlé is planning to use the robot nationwide in around 1,000 stores by the end of 2015.","Robot Pepper starts its role to help sell coffee machines in home appliance stores in Japan this month .

"When a huge star many times the mass of the sun comes to the end of its life it collapses in on itself and forms a singularity - creating a black hole where gravity is so strong that not even light itself can escape. At least, that’s what we thought. A scientist has sensationally said that it is impossible for black holes to exist - and she even has mathematical proof to back up her claims. If true, her research could force physicists to scrap their theories of how the universe began. A scientist from University of North Carolina states she has mathematical proof that black holes (illustrated) can't exist. She said it is impossible for stars to collapse and form a singularity. Previously, scientists thought stars  larger than the sun collapsed under their own gravity and formed black holes as they died . The research was conducted by Professor Laura Mersini-Houghton from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the College of Arts and Scientists. She claims that as a star dies, it releases a type of radiation known as Hawking radiation - predicted by Professor Stephen Hawking. One of the biggest unanswered questions about black holes is the so-called information paradox. Under current theories for black holes it is thought that nothing can escape from the event horizon around a black hole - not even light itself. Inside the black hole is thought to be a singularity where matter is crushed to an infinitesimally small point as predicted by Einstein's theory of gravity. However, a fundamental law of quantum theory states that no information from the universe can ever disappear. This creates a paradox; how can a black hole make matter and information 'disappear'? Professor Mersini-Houghton's new theory manages to explain why this might be so - namely because black holes as we know them cannot exist. However in this process, Professor Mersini-Houghton believes the star also sheds mass, so much so that it no longer has the density to become a black hole. Before the black hole can form, she said, the dying star swells and explodes. The singularity as predicted never forms, and neither does the event horizon - the boundary of the black hole where not even light can escape. ‘I’m still not over the shock,’ said Professor Mersini-Houghton. ‘We’ve been studying this problem for a more than 50 years and this solution gives us a lot to think about.’ Experimental evidence may one day provide physical proof as to whether or not black holes exist in the universe. But for now, Mersini-Houghton says the mathematics are conclusive. What’s more, the research could apparently even call into question the veracity of the Big Bang theory. Most physicists think the universe originated from a singularity that began expanding with the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago. If it is impossible for singularities to exist, however, as partially predicted by Professor Mersini-Houghton, then that theory would also be brought into question. During the collapse process stars release a type of radiation called Hawking radiation (shown). But Professor Mersini-Houghton claims this process means the star loses too much mass and can't form a black hole. And this also apparently means the Big Bang theory, that the universe began as a singularity, may not be correct . Earlier this year Professor Stephen Hawking shocked physicists by saying 'there are no black holes'. In a paper published online, Professor Hawking instead argues there are 'grey holes' 'The absence of event horizons means that there are no black holes - in the sense of regimes from which light can't escape to infinity,' he says in the paper, called Information Preservation and Weather Forecasting For Black Holes. He says that the idea of an event horizon, from which light cannot escape, is flawed. He suggests that instead light rays attempting to rush away from the black hole’s core will be held as though stuck on a treadmill and that they can slowly shrink by spewing out radiation. One of the reasons black holes are so bizarre is that they pit two fundamental theories of the universe against each other. Namely, Einstein’s theory of gravity predicts the formation of black holes. But a fundamental law of quantum theory states that no information from the universe can ever disappear. Efforts to combine these two theories proved problematic, and has become known as the black hole information paradox - how can matter permanently disappear in a black hole as predicted? Professor Mersini-Houghton’s new theory does manage to mathematically combine the two fundamental theories, but with unwanted effects for people expecting black holes to exist. ‘Physicists have been trying to merge these two theories - Einstein’s theory of gravity and quantum mechanics - for decades, but this scenario brings these two theories together, into harmony,’ said Professor Mersini-Houghton. ‘And that’s a big deal.’","Scientist claims she has mathematical proof black holes cannot exist .

"They were once the glamorous accessories of the great characters of the 20th century. Beloved by prime ministers and film stars alike the fat, ideally Cuban, cigar was the must have item for any powerful man. But it seems the cigars so favoured by Sir Winston Churchill, Clint Eastwood and Groucho Marx may soon become a thing of the past. Falling popularity: It seems the cigars so favoured by the likes of former prime minister Sir Winston Churchill (left) and comedian Groucho Marx (right) may soon become a thing of the past . Famous fans: Actor Clint Eastwood (left, in 1972 film High Plains Drifter) and engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel (right) are also known for their cigar smoking . Over the last five years cigar consumption has dropped by a fifth, the continuation of a pattern which has seen the numbers fall by 80 per cent over the last two decades. And experts warn that if current trends persist the age-old art will become extinct in Britain by 2026. Figures from Revenue and Customs show that while Britons bought 4.6million lb of cigars in 1992, last year they bought just a fraction of that at 880,000 lb. The UK cigar market as a whole fell by 20 per cent between 2007 and 2012, helped in no small part by the rollout of indoor smoking bans across the country in 2007. Cigar enthusiasts believe the items have been unfairly targeted by this legislation, because they last more than an hour and are designed to be enjoyed slowly as opposed to a hasty cigarette in the cold. Cigars on screen: Del Boy (Sir David Jason, left) in Only Fools and Horses and Arthur Daley (George Cole, right) in Minder . Known for smoking cigars: TV executive Michael Grade in 1969 with his father, theatrical agent Leslie Grade . The number of large cigars sold in Britain fell 40 per cent to 11.6million in the same period - declining twice as fast as smaller cigarillos. 'They see them as something their dad or grandad would smoke' Simon Evans, Imperial Tobacco . There are only 300,000 regular cigar smokers left in Britain, according to Imperial Tobacco, the UK’s second largest tobacco company. Ten years ago, 700,000 people were cigar smokers. Simon Evans of Imperial Tobacco told the Financial Times this is due to a lack of interest in the youth market. He said: ‘They see them as something their dad or grandad would smoke.’ Two thirds of all cigars sold in Britain are the cheaper miniature variety. Despite the steady decline in cigar smokers, sales of premium cigars which are handmade and aged have risen. Luxury hotels are catering to smokers of high end cigars, providing Cosas - Comfortable Outdoor Smoking Areas. Two years ago, the Ritz Hotel opened an indoor cigar room next to its casino.","Britons bought 4.6m lb of cigars in 1992, but just 880,000 lb last year .

"The rookie Cleveland police officer who fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a park had a poor job performance record and was forced out of a suburban police department after just a few months on the job, it was revealed today. Surveillance video released by police showed Tamir being shot by Officer Tim Loehmann within 2 seconds of a patrol car stopping near him at a park on November 22. It shows the boy reaching in his waistband for what police discovered was an airsoft gun, which shoots non-lethal plastic projectiles. He died the next day. Scroll down for video . Bad cop: Rookie officer Tim Loehmann, pictured left, quit the Independence Police Department in December 2012 after just six months on the job. His superiors described him as lacking in maturity, weepy and distracted . Final moments: In footage released by the Cleveland Police Department, a police car pulls up alongside Tamir Rice, who reaches for his belt and gets shot . In the blink of an eye: It took Officer Loehmann 2 seconds to shoot Rice after mistaking his BB gun for a real firearm . Police said Officer Loehmann believed the boy had a real firearm. Loehmann joined Cleveland police in March after spending six months in 2012 with the police department in Independence, Ohio - a community of about 7,100 located 12 miles southeast of Cleveland. Personnel files released Wednesday showed police supervisors in Independence decided he lacked the maturity needed to work in their department. A letter in his file said there was a pattern of a lack of indiscretion and of not following instructions. 'In law enforcement there are times when instructions need be followed to the letter, and I am under the impression Ptl. Loehmann, under certain circumstances, will not react in the way instructed,' the letter said. Loehmann's superiors within the department described the rookie cop as being 'weepy' and 'distracted' during firearms qualification training, reported Cleveland.com. 'He could not follow simple directions, could not communicate clear thoughts nor recollections, and his handgun performance was dismal,' according to the letter written by Deputy Chief Jim Polak. Polak concluded Loehmann's evaluation by stating that in his opinion, neither time nor training 'will be able to change or correct' the officer's professional deficiencies. Lackluster record: Officer Loehmann's (left) police file states that he once fell asleep during training, violated orders and on another occasion left his gun in an unsecured locker . Pointed remark: During a memorial service for Tamir Rice Wednesday, the boy's uncle told mourners that police need to revamp how they train officers . Loehmann resigned from the Independence Police Department in December 2012 after meeting his supervisors about their concerns. He was hired by the Cleveland Police Department in March 2013. The officer's father has said in a recent interview that his son quit the force in suburban Independence and joined the big-city department because he wanted 'more action.' It remains unknown if Cleveland police supervisors read Loehmann's personnel file from Independence before hiring him. Tim Loehmann's records indicate that the young officer's troubled relationship with his girlfriend adversely impacted his job performance during his six-month tenure at the suburban police department. According to a report written by one of his supervisors, Loehmann once fell asleep during training and was often seen weeping. On another occasion, he left his firearm in an unsecured locker, according to 19 Action News. In November 2012, Loehmann took off from the police dispatch center without permission and then lied about it to a supervisor. Loehmann told his superiors that he wanted to quit, move to New York City and join the NYPD where his father served for 20 years. The department was in the process of firing him when Loehmann quit of his own accord. Several hundred people attended the memorial for Tamir at Mount Sinai Baptist Church Wednesday . Pallbearers carry out the body of the 12-year-old boy from Gaines Funeral Home Wednesday . Despite all his apparent shortcomings, perceived lack of maturity and inability to follow directions, his files said he was 'eligible for rehire.' During a memorial service for Tamir Rice Wednesday, the boy's uncle told mourners that police need to revamp how they train officers while also looking closer at police brutality and the use of excessive force. A grand jury will consider whether to charge Tim Loehmann in connection to Rice's shooting. Just days after the tragedy, protesters marched past City Hall and temporarily blocked rush-hour traffic on a busy Cleveland freeway. Several hundred people attended the memorial for Tamir at Mount Sinai Baptist Church earlier today. Family members and friends, some wearing shirts with Tamir's picture, filed past displays of photos at the front of the church and stopped to hug his mother. One of his former teachers said Tamir liked to draw, play basketball and the drums.","Officer Tim Loehmann's personnel file at Independence Police Department contains letter describing the rookie as lacking in ability to follow orders .

"Footage screened on Russian TV shows the moment one of Vladimir Putin's 'Bear Bombers' is intercepted by British Typhoon jets over the English Channel. The video was filmed from the window of one of the huge Cold War-era Tu-95 planes which Russian military chiefs are sending to 'buzz' British airspace. It was released to Kremlin-backed  TV channels in Moscow and is believed to have been shot during a stand-off in the skies off the coast of Bournemouth last month. Two Russian bombers made similar manoeuvres this week, skirting British airspace off the coast of Cornwall, where they were intercepted and escorted by the two RAF Typhoon fighters. The footage from TV Zvedza, which is owned by the Russian defence ministry, shows armed RAF and Nato jets flying in close formation with the plane and provides clear views of the bomber's turboprop engines. One RAF Typhoon flies so close that the pilot can clearly be seen through the cockpit glass. Scroll down for video . Up in the air: Footage of British and French fighter jets escorting a Russian bomber has been released by a Kremlin-backed TV station . The footage is believed to be from one of the previous occasions that Nato fighters have been sent to monitor the activities of Russian aircraft . The footage emerged as former military top brass warned Britain cannot defend itself against the military threat posed by Russia. Military chiefs said the UK 'could not cope' if Russia attacked because our defences had been 'decimated'. RAF fighter jets this week scrambled to intercept two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles as they flew menacingly off the coast of Cornwall. In a sign of the growing provocation from Russian president Vladimir Putin, the Tupolev Tu95 Bear aircraft streaked along the fringes of UK airspace, prompting the deployment of two state-of-the-art Typhoons. David Cameron defiantly dismissed the incident, saying the Russians 'are trying to make some sort of a point, and I don't think we should dignify it with too much of a response'. He added: 'I think what this episode demonstrates is that we do have the fast jets, the pilots, the systems in place to protect the UK.' But former air chiefs rubbished the Prime Minister's claims, saying the number of British fighter squadrons had plunged from 26 at the end of the Cold War to just seven following heavy RAF cuts by successive governments. Sir Michael Graydon, former head of the RAF, said: 'I very much doubt whether the UK could sustain a shooting war against Russia. We are at half the capabilities we had previously.' Russian military planes, ships and submarines have made at least 17 incursions close to the UK since the start of last year as the increasingly truculent regime in Moscow tests Western response times.

Sir Michael added: 'They fly in these regions to check our air defences and have probably worked out we are not as sharp as we were. 'They know it is provocative and they are doing it at a time when defence in the west is pretty wet compared to where they are.' Since 2010, the Coalition has axed 30,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen as well as hundreds of warships, fighter jets, spy planes and tanks in a bid to cut the Ministry of Defence's budget by £4.7 billion and plug a £40 billion hole in equipment spending. Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, who commanded Allied forces in northern Iraq in 1999, said: 'If the Russians turned up the heat, we would struggle badly. 'If Putin wanted to attack, he would not send a pair of bombers, he would send the lot and saturate our defences; we couldn't cope. 'The Typhoon is a really good aircraft but with their relatively small numbers they would be overwhelmed: the Russians would outflank us, go around us or just go through us.' He added: 'The modern generation of politicians has grown up in absolute security – they've never felt a threat to their existence, safety or security. 'They've taken peace for granted and decimated the Armed Forces. Let's hope we don't pay the price.' The latest incident came as Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned that Putin posed a 'real and present danger' to three former Soviet satellites in the Baltics – Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Vladimir Komoyedov, chairman of the Russian parliament's defence committee, accused Mr Fallon, 62, of 'stupidity'. He added: 'I feel that he is a bit too old, not only in terms of his age but also in his ideas.' Tensions: Prime Minister David Cameron (left, pictured yesterday in Suffolk) defiantly dismissed the incident, which was a sign of the growing provocation from Russian president Vladimir Putin (right, pictured yesterday in St Petersburg). Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (centre) said that Putin posed a 'real and present danger' to three former Soviet satellites in the Baltics . Former UK ambassador to Moscow Sir Andrew Wood BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning: 'It's a dangerous moment because Russia is a state of, in a sense, frozen anarchy. It's not a proper state. 'What they've done in Ukraine is to begin an adventure. They don't know how to end it, so there is some danger that their frustrations there will overspill into other areas. 'The Baltic states have been under pressure from Russia. But the majority of Russian-speaking citizens of those Baltic states actually do not want change. They are not emigrating to Russia. They would rather be in the EU and they would rather come to the West freely, which they do.' The two Typhoons, armed with air-to-air missiles, were launched from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire on Wednesday after the Russian bombers were spotted at 6.30pm. They were escorted as they flew south, then turned around and flew north past the Irish coast. Elizabeth Quintana, of defence think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, said: 'We have to find a way to stop the Russians because there is a chance things could get very nasty very quickly.' The House of Lords' EU Sub-Committee on External Affairs today accused Britain and the EU of 'sleepwalking' into the Ukraine crisis, by failing to read Russia's political ambitions. A report said: ""There has been a strong element of 'sleepwalking' into the current crisis, with Member States being taken by surprise by events in Ukraine.' It added: 'A loss of collective analytical capacity has weakened Member States' ability to read the political shifts in Russia and to offer an authoritative response.'

"Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the center of an investigation into the targeting of conservative groups, has spoke out for the first time since she invoked her legal right not to testify against herself at a congressional hearing more than a year ago. Lerner sat down with Politico ahead of a profile it released on her this morning and revealed that she has received death threats since leaving the government agency and has been called hateful names, like 'dirty Jew' and told she'll 'go down in history as the worst person ever in the United States.' Another time someone told her she was 'going to be put away in the deepest, darkest dungeon, and they were going to lock me up and throw away the key.' One death threat was so bad that federal agents had to guard her home, Lerner said. Despite the fallout from her admission last May that the IRS had inappropriately scrutinized some groups with political affiliations more than others, Lerner said she has no regrets about the way she handled herself throughout the controversy. 'I didn’t do anything wrong,' Lerner told Politico. 'I’m proud of my career and the job I did for this country.' Scroll down for video . Lois Lerner, the former director of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) exempt organizations office, is pictured here during a House hearing in Washington, D.C on May 22, 2013. Lerner recently spoke out about a controversy involving her department's targeting of conservatives for the first time since the congressional hearing . Lerner had mostly faded into obscurity since refusing to give testimony to a House Oversight committee last year, claiming that she could self-incriminate herself, before her lengthy interview with Politico. Although her name has been in the news consistently over the last several months as the IRS revealed to congressional investigators that a computer crash caused the loss of a large chunk of Lerner's emails from 2011-2013, Lerner herself has stayed out of the fray until now. In her interview Lerner defended herself against accusations being made by conservatives, including claims that she purposefully ruined her hard drive to throw investigators off her trail. 'How would I know two years ahead of time that it would be important for me to destroy emails, and if I did know that, why wouldn’t I have destroyed the other ones they keep releasing?' she asked. Lerner told Politico she believes she's receiving much of the blame for her department's wrongdoing because she was the first IRS official to acknowledge it publicly. 'I was the person who announced it,' she said. 'I assume the other part of it is because I declined to talk, and once I declined to talk, they could say anything they wanted, and they knew I couldn’t say anything back.' Former colleagues of Lerner suggested to Politico that they agreed and argued that the former tax exempt chief was not the only IRS official who  made missteps in the years leading up to the public controversy. And despite being a registered Democrat, Lerner told Politico that she'd voted for candidates from both political parties and that generally, she's 'not a political person.' A former boss of Lerner's at the Federal Election Commission, where Lerner worked for 20 years before moving over to the IRS in 2001, backed up Lerner's self-assessment. But two former colleagues of Lerner's from the FEC, both of whom are Republicans, said she was a partisan to the core, as evidenced by her vocal support of stricter oversight of political donations, a stance generally held by progressives and strongly opposed by conservatives. 'Lois’ ideology is against money in politics, is ‘anti-contribution’; that’s her bias,' Craig Engle, a former executive assistant to a Republican FEC commissioner told Politico. 'Her ideology inhibited fair administration of the law.' Former coworkers at the IRS also offered up mixed opinions of Lerner, with some saying they 'really loved her big personality,' as Politico put it, and others depicting her as someone who was overly passionate about her work and 'snapped to judgment quickly.' 'We didn’t always get along, ' Nikole Flax, the former chief of staff to the IRS commissioner in charge when the targeting scandal erupted, told the House Oversight committee during its investigation into Lerner. 'We would have occasions when I would, you know, call her, and she could scream for a minute.' 'Her fuse was short, and if you come to the IRS, you better be able to sit and listen and ask questions and absorb and rethink, and she had a hard time doing that,' recalled Debra Kawecki, who worked with Lerner at the IRS at the beginning of her tenure there. Kawecki retired in 2006, Politico noted, five years after Lerner began working there and the same year that Lerner took over the tax exempt division of the agency. Lerner, center, and former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman, left, were forced out of the IRS as a result of the Tea Party targeting scandal. The two are pictured here at the House hearing, where Lerner invoked her right not to self incriminate herself, with Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin, right . A former director of the same department Lerner oversaw at the IRS suggested that her limited knowledge of tax policy may have led to her division's inappropriate probing of groups it suspected of political activity. 'When managers are not familiar with the laws they are enforcing, they make bad decisions,' Marc Owens, a former tax exempt division head, told Politico. He also indicated that side projects Lerner pursued that were meant to streamline processes at the agency may have been a 'major contributing factor' to slow approval process of conservative groups' applications for non exempt status after the IRS' investigation into them concluded. Emails of Lerner's that were turned over to congressional committees investigating the matter show that the IRS agency sought to rectify the situation in early 2013 as a government investigation threatened to expose the department's bad behavior. A group of emails released by a Senate subcommittee indicate that the IRS and Lerner were worried about the findings of the Treasury investigation and wanted to get their side of the story out before the government agency's Office of Inspector General released it's own report. Throughout the OIG's investigation Lerner maintained that scrutiny of conservative groups was not politically motivated and was instead the result of department policy to more heavily screen organizations whose names included politically charged phrases like 'tea party' and 'patriot.' She also argued that the IRS' intense examinations of those groups did not often result in them being denied tax exempt status, proving that the IRS was no more discriminatory of right-leaning groups than it was other organizations when it came to handing out tax benefits. Sensing that Treasury intended to side with conservative groups who were crying foul, the IRS concocted a plan to acknowledge the targeting, explain that that it was the result of poor management of 'front-line staff' in it's Cincinnati, Ohio, branch and hope that the incident blew over quickly. The IRS first planned to have Lerner apologize for providing lax oversight of the satellite office in a speech she was giving in late April but decided against it last-minute. She eventually commented on the situation at another public speaking engagement several weeks later. At that event, hosted by the American Bar Association, Lerner, who is herself a lawyer, staged a question about the affair so that she could deliver the agency's mea culpa in a controlled environment. The admission set off a media firestorm, and within days IRS commissioner Steven Miller was forced to resign. A week after that, Lerner was put on indefinite leave. Before the IRS could terminate her employment, she followed through with a previously planned retirement and left the tax agency for good with a full pension, which is valued at approximately $100,000 a year. Much of that money now goes towards Lerner's legal fees, which she says have already exceed $100,000. Lerner told Politico that she'd like to work in the tax or legal profession again but she's been unable to find employment elsewhere and can't even get volunteer jobs at organizations outside of Washington in her line of work. As a result, Lerner has taken up volunteering at a local arts non profit, though she wouldn't tell Politico which one - 'I feel like having my name attached does nothing but cause issues for people,' she said - and spends her remaining free time gardening and walking her dogs. Even though she's had a difficult time recovering from the controversy both personally and financially, Lerner says not going to let her detractors 'ruin my life.' 'Regardless of whatever else happens, I know I did the best I could under the circumstances and am not sorry for anything I did,' she said.","Lerner spoke out for the first time since she invoked her legal right not to testify against herself at a congressional hearing more than a year ago .

"When Kenny Lovelace took Molly Ryan to Coors Field to see the Colorado Rockies play the Arizona Diamondbacks last week, he had a diamond ring in his back pocket and a big plan. Lovelace had already informed Ryan's parents that he planned on asking Molly to be his wife and that he was going to project the romantic question on the stadium's jumbotron. Lovelace, the entire Ryan family, and secretly hired wedding photographer Kerinsa Mullins, made their way to the stadium for an unforgettable and comedic night. But their camera ready moment was ruined when a disgruntled old woman watching the game made her feelings known by flipping the bird to the camera. Kenny Lovelace(right) proposes to Molly Ryan(left) at Coors Field as an old woman (front) gives the middle finger to photographer, Kerinsa Mullins . : www.kerinsamarie.com . Kenny Lovelace proposed to Molly Ryan by projecting 'Will you marry me, Molly?' on the giant stadium jumbotron: . www.kerinsamarie.com . The couple enjoyed a romantic evening despite being flipped off by the old lady in some of the photographs taken by Kerinsa Mullins: www.kerinsamarie.com . Molly Ryan knew that Lovelace was going to propose to her at some point but didn't know exactly when. According to coverage from WTOP, hours earlier at a taco bell, Molly picked up a hot sauce packet that read, 'will you marry me?' She reportedly threw the hot sauce packet at Lovelace and said, 'See? even Taco Bell thinks you should marry me.' When the family arrived at the game, everything was set for the jumbo plan. Kerinsa Mullins and her husband were standing a few rows away from the family ready to snap of photo of Lovelace and Ryan the moment he popped the question. Not Planned was the fact that the photographer was going to be seated near an older couple who wanted to watch the game and nothing but the game. As soon as the jumbotron flashed, 'Will you marry me, Molly?' the photographer stood up to take a photo of the proposal and the grouchy older couple yelled at her to sit down. Upon taking the photograph, Mullins explained to the elderly couple that she was only standing monetarily to photograph the proposal. Lovelace dropped to his knee. Molly Ryan said, 'Yes!' and the crowd cheered. 'He got down on one knee and that's when I realized it was me and I just started crying and it was a great moment,' Ryan says. Molly Ryan displays her new engagement ring after Kenny Lovelace proposed to her for the entire Colorado stadium to see . The older woman seated near Mullins was none too pleased. Another person who was with the older couple even called over a security guard because she couldn't return to her seat. Mullins received glares. 'They kept yelling at me and I just ignored them because I was there to do a job and I did not want to miss something that would be so brief and so important,' Mullins says. Once the security guard came over to Mullins, she moved out of the unhappy trio's way. It wasn't until the next day that Mullins found an unwanted surprise in an otherwise romantic photograph of Lovelace and Ryan. 'in about 20 of them, she and her friend are giving me the stink eye,' Mullins says. Molly Ryan's facebook page humorously displays Kerinsa Mullin's photo as her profile picture . In one of the photos the older woman is pictured flipping her middle finger at the camera. Mullins was worried the couple might be disappointed at first, but Ryan was extremely amused. 'I couldn't stop laughing. I said it was the greatest photo I've ever seen...There is a girl sitting behind us that is so excited for us. My mom is crying, I'm crying, and Ken's nervous and then there's this lady flipping us off,' says Ryan. Ryan Joked about making the photo a 'save the date' magnet for friends and family. While some friends were sad for Ryan that the old woman may have ruined her special moment, Ryan maintained her sense of humor and poise. Ryan is quoted as saying that is she finds out the identity of the curmudgeon she'd like to, 'make her famous.'She has even offered to invite the old lady to the wedding. 'I would love for her to appear in one of my pictures at the wedding. That would be terrific,' Ryan says. The photo of the woman flipping off her finger is now Molly Ryan's profile photo on facebook. The Old woman has yet to reveal her mysterious identity.","'Will you marry me, Molly?' read the stadium jumbotron .

"It's only day two of Rosie O'Donnell's return to The View and she's already made an enemy of her conservative co-host, former George W. aide Nicolle Wallace. The fracas started off with the question of whether President Obama is a people person and devolved when O'Donnell took offense at the assertion by Wallace that he might not be. 'I'm not saying things all Dems disagree with,' insisted the Republican PR whiz, before O'Donnell went on the attack. Scroll down for video and full fight transcript: . Acrimony already! Republican Nicolle Wallace and liberal Rosie O'Donnell traded some harsh words on just the second episode of The View's new lineup . The once-booted co-hosted compared Wallace's characterization of Obama with the 'international incident' that came when rapper Kanye West publicly declared that Bush's response (or lack thereof) to the Katrina disaster meant he hated black people. 'He revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement,' Wallace said of her then boss, who wrote of his dismay over West's assertion in his 2010 memoir Decision Points. She then called O'Donnell's words 'an attack.' O'Donnell snatched the opportunity to turn Wallace's words against her. 'He was very upset in the plane as he flew over Katrina,' quipped the comedienne. 'It was a very long time before he showed up. That is a fact, not an attack.' Wallace, who just the day before admitted on the show that she had nothing to do with Bush's decision not to visit Katrina--but simply fly over it--was forced to agree. Ironically, on the season's same inaugural episode, O'Donnell made sure to say of Wallace: 'I like her, I swear!' Whether that's true or not, the hot and cold chemistry appears to have worked, at least for the time being. The season 15 premier on Monday, which also welcomed Rosie Perez to the panel, won the show its highest ratings in eight years. According to The Wrap, it's the second most watched premier ever for the daytime series. The argument began over George W. Bush's handling of the Katrina disaster, and O'Donnell ended up forcing Wallace to admit the president made a major mistake by taking so long to visit the ravaged southern city . Controversial: Here, Bush and his Cabinet members discuss a response to hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Many critics point to the administrations sluggish response in helping the city of New Orleans as one of the biggest mars on Bush's presidency . It likely didn't disappoint, at least not viewers interested in seeing Rosie O'Donnell up to her old (some say intentionally) irksome tricks. Complaining of sciatica, the comedienne did the entire show with no shoes on and at times rubbed her feet well above the table for all to see. Backstage, Goldberg said the hosts had been told the past few years to avoid political topics. That clearly wasn't the case Monday, either, as the four cast members dove right into a discussion about domestic abuse and the National Football League, along with changing attitudes toward corporal punishment. O'Donnell said that while she was able to look past abuse charges against Chris Brown and enjoy his work, she couldn't do that with Woody Allen and no longer sees his movies. Goldberg couldn't stifle giggles when talking to Wallace about Sarah Palin, with whom she clashed while working for the GOP's 2008 national ticket. 'When did you want to just pop her?' Perez asked. Otherwise, Wallace struggled to get a few words in during her first show. 'I'm a Republican, we should get that out of the way,' she said in introducing herself. As for Rosie, she said she's expecting a smoother time than her previous eight months on 'The View,' which ended in 2007. In part that's because longtime producer Bill Geddie is out, replaced by Rachel Maddow's former producer, Bill Wolff. 'We had a different idea of what the show could or should be,' she said about her first tenure. 'But when someone invites you into their house for dinner, you don't rearrange the furniture. This is a new house with a new owner, and I was invited to consult on what the furniture should be.' Unsanitary: Rosie O'Donnell immediately perturbed her co-hosts by insisting on doing the entire show without shoes on Monday . Back to their old tricks? Backstage, Goldberg said the hosts had been told the past few years to avoid political topics . Unimpressed: Rosie Perez voted to move on from the topic of Katrina and George Bush after Wallace and O'Donnell traded barbs . Nicolle Wallace helped stir the first of what could be a lot of major The View sparring matches. Tuesday's fight, which should be noted came in just the second episode of the season, started when she argued that Obama isn't much of a people person. 'Are you implying that Obama doesn't (love people)?' O'Donnell barked. 'Yeah...I don't think so,' the former Bush aide replied. 'Oh, that's bull crap,' new host Rosie Perez snapped. 'You are so wrong.' Things became truly heated when Rosie O'Donnell recalled rapper Kanye West's claims in the aftermath of Katrina that Bush ignored black people. 'Let me just ask you something, when Kanye West says ""I don't think President Bush cares about black people"" it's like an international incident,' she said. 'But you can say that you don't think Obama likes people?' 'George Bush, when he wrote his book, one of the most interesting things he revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement,' said Wallace. O'Donnell pounced, to audience applause. 'I think he was very upset in the plane as he FLEW OVER Katrina.' 'We talked about that yesterday,' said Wallace. 'As African Americans, one could understand the righteous anger of [West's] statement,' Rosie said. 'Let me just answer your attack on president Bush and Katrina,' Wallace said. 'A lot of people were very happy with what got done to rebuild New Orleans. New Orleans is a safer place because of what it went through.' 'I did not attack him,' O'Donnell responded. 'I simply stated the fact that he flew over in a plane before he ever went to address the people who were there and it was a very long time before he showed up. A nodding Wallace was forced to agree. Source: HuffPost . She's still got it! Despite her retirement, The View co-creator Barbara Walters showed up for a cameo as the forum's queen and proved she still knows how to produce controversy after Tuesday's fight and Monday's raked-in ratings . O'Donnell was the ringmaster during commercial breaks, taking a microphone and interacting with the audience. It created some moments funnier than what appeared on the air, like when one onlooker asked whether someone else might be added to the four-person cast. 'This isn't enough for you?' she joked. 'Get the (expletive) out.' Onscreen, she played a brief game with an audience member and Perez, asking them to guess which Rosie had said or done certain things. Also Monday, Kristin Chenoweth came on for a song in tribute to the late Joan Rivers. Walters, who invented the format nearly two decades ago, watched the proceedings from offstage. She filmed an awkward show-opening segment seated in a 'throne' where the four hosts briefly approached and bowed before her. Wolff said he talked to Walters a couple of times a week to get advice. The new executive producer, brought on midway through the show's makeover, said he was largely responsible for hiring Perez and Wallace. 'This is our chance to take our leap forward creatively,' Wolff said. He said he hoped the audience would recognize that the four cast members are all smart, accomplished, able to have vigorous conversations and disagree with one another while still liking each other at the end. It's a work in progress: Except for one practice run-through, Monday was the first time all four women had been together. Rosie O'Donnell returned to The View today for what is being billed as a new version of the long-running show. But apparently the cantankerous comedienne is up to her old tricks behind the scenes. Sources at The View tell MailOnline that Rosie has already become a terror, only allowing the three new executive producers and co-hosts; Whoopi Goldberg and newcomers Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace, to communicate with her and making it clear to everyone in earshot, she's literally running the show. 'She was at The View for several days last week, meeting with producers and telling them ""how things are going to go"". She has a definitive view of how she would like the show to go and wants everyone else to fall in line,' a show insider told MailOnline . Last Wednesday, Rosie and new co-host Nicole Wallace did a test show with two fill-in hosts in an effort to build chemistry. Neither Rosie Perez or Whoopi Goldberg were present. Despite the fact that Whoopi is the regular moderator for the show, leading the discussion, Rosie took charge of the test show with Nicole. 'It was almost as though she was rehearsing for when she eventually takes over as moderator. It's clear that she would have preferred being in that capacity as she was before,' offered our source. Rosie joined The View in 2006, replacing Meredith Vieira. But the following year Rosie and Elizabeth Hasselbeck had a heated exchange that got so intense producers cut to a split screen, something that Rosie despised. She walked off the set that day and never returned to the show. But Whoopi was clear after Rosie complained several times in recent days: 'I'm moderating and that's how it's going to be, so work with me babe!' 'Rosie actually said aloud, ""This is taking forever! I know we're on tape, but should it take 4 hours?"" 'No one responds when she makes snarky comments except Whoopi, because everyone else fears for their job,' detailed the source. The sentiment backstage after the test show was that the four co-hosts were 'boring together' and they were going to have to find some excitement before today's show.","The yin and yang co-hosts duked it out after O'Donnell slammed George W.'s sluggish response to help ailing New Orleans .

"United Flight 1637 was returning off-duty Air Force Captain Mike Gongol, his family and 157 other souls from their Christmas vacation when disaster struck. The Boeing 737's pilot suffered a devastating heart attack at 30,000 feet on the way from Des Moines to Denver, forcing Gongol to rush to the cockpit and help guide the plane to an emergency landing. His heroic actions have gone unheralded until now, as Gongol recalls the dramatic moment he answered the chilling announcement on the December 30 flight, 'Does anyone know how to fly a plane?' Scroll down for video . Hero: Capt. Mark Gongol, 13th Air Support Operations Squadron assistant director of operations at Fort Carson, helped land a commercial 737 Dec. 30 when the pilot had a medical emergency . Gongol, who has flown supersonic B-1B Lancer nuclear bombers and works out of Fort Carson, Colorado, first realized something was wrong when 30 minutes into the flight he saw the engines power down to idle. Then the aircraft began to descend and bank steeply to the right. 'Over the public address system; a flight attendant asked if there was a doctor on board the plane,' said Gongol in his first interview since that dramatic flight, given to Air Force Space Command. 'A few more calls went out for medical professionals and the flight attendants were all hurrying to first class with their beverage carts and a first-aid kit.' His military training told him to stay seated with his wife and daughter and remain out of the way. Suddenly, a heart-stopping announcement came over the PA system: 'Are there any non-revenue pilots on board? Please ring your call button.' At that gut-wrenching moment, Gongol realized the sick person was the pilot. According to Air Force Space Command, Gongol, 'looked to his wife; as she gave him a nod, Gongol pressed his button and headed toward the flight desk.' Walking briskly to the cockpit, Gongol saw that the pilot was desperately ill. Gongol immediately knew he was suffering a serious cardiac event. Drama at 30,000 feet: Flight 1637 (not pictured) was traveling from Des Moines to Denver when the pilot of the Boeing 737 suffered a heart attack . Hero: Quick-thinking nurse Linda Alweiss, . pictured left and right, rushed to respond when the pilot suffered a . heart-attack mid-flight . 'After they moved the pilot, I was asked by the first officer, 'are you a pilot,' which was quickly followed with 'what do you fly,' said Gongol. 'I knew she was in a serious situation and that question gave her five seconds to judge if I would be useful. 'I also had about five seconds to asses her, 'was she panicking, or was she OK to fly the aircraft?' 'We both finished our silent assessments, she made the right judgment and told me to close the door and have a seat.' Summoning all his training, Gongol decided it was best if he adopted a supportive role to the first officer and began to man the radio and troubleshoot any issues as they approached landing. 'She was calm, but you could tell she was a little stressed, who wouldn't be,' said Gongol. 'At the beginning, I interrupted her flow of operations, but we figured everything out extremely quickly. She was very impressive.' It was then that the first officer turned to Gongol and revealed she had never landed at Omaha airport before. However, Gongol had landed there during his training and talked her through it. 'I saw nothing but the finest professionalism under pressure out of the flight attendants, the nurses and the first officer,' said Gongol. 'Everyone aboard the aircraft remained calm, there is no doubt in my mind this contributed above all else to our successful outcome. 'In my opinion any military pilot would have done the exact same thing I did.' Room to work: Alweiss and another nurse, Amy .

Scary: Mrs Alweiss was flying home via Denver with her husband and 16-year-old daughter from a Christmas vacation when the frightening announcements were made . The pilot survived and has since thanked Gongol for his actions. He was helped in his survival by quick-thinking nurse Linda Alweiss, from Camarillo. Mrs Alweiss was flying home via Denver with her husband and 16-year-old daughter from a Christmas vacation. When the first announcement was made the registered nurse with decades of experience was first to respond. She said she found the pilot slumped over in the cockpit. 'He was sick and mumbling and was just incoherent,' she told KTLA. The pediatric intensive care nurse, who only recently re-certified her advanced cardiac life support accreditation, noticed his heart was beating irregularly and determined he'd probably suffered a blood clot or a heart-attack. On the rescheduled flight on New Years Eve, Mrs Alweiss sat next to the co-pilot who informed her the pilot had survived and was being treated in the cardiac unit of an Omaha hospital.","Air Force Captain Mike Gongol answered the PA call to fly United Flight 1637 .

A Muslim has his temperature checked for the ebola virus at the Hajj Camp . More than 700 more Ebola cases emerged in West Africa in one week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said, showing that the outbreak is accelerating. Just three weeks ago the number of new cases was around 500 for a seven-day period. The number of people believed to have been killed is now more than 2,600, an increase of roughly 200 from the last estimate, the WHO said. Most deaths have been in Liberia. The new figures from the UN health agency show that the disease is thought to have affected more than 5,300 people. Just under half of those cases were recorded in the last three weeks. Some 318 healthcare workers have fallen ill, and about half have died. The outbreak has struck Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal. Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says the number of Ebola cases is doubling every three weeks and is calling for a 20-fold increase in aid totalling almost $1billion to tackle the virus's worst-ever outbreak over the next six months. The UN chief told an emergency meeting of the Security Council today that the Ebola epidemic in West Africa 'demands the attention of the world' and 'unprecedented' action. Ban announced that he is establishing a UN emergency mission to address the unprecedented challenge. He thanked U.S. President Barack Obama for sending 3,000 troops to provide expertise in training and engineering, read the names of about 20 other countries that have responded with contributions and urged all nations coming to the UN General Assembly ministerial meeting next week to follow suit.

"Raising a glass to her 11 dining companions, the bubbles in Claire Lightbody's champagne sparkle in the candlelight. A waitress emerges to clear away the goat's cheese ravioli starter before serving each guest with a lime and lemon granita palate cleanser, complete with tiny limoncello spheres — something Heston Blumenthal would surely be proud of. Next up is a vibrant pea, mint and honeyed ham hock soup, each bowl perched amid an ornate nest of twigs. Then, beef wellington and a mint chocolate delice for dessert. Secret weapon: Claire Lightbody, right, hires Michelle Burge, 'a home gourmet', to cook meals to wow her dinner party guests . You might imagine that this decadent feast is being served in a swanky Michelin-starred restaurant — the kind most of us can only dream of affording to go to. In fact, the setting is a lot closer to home. Well, Claire's home anyway. It is the dining room of her five-bedroom country house near Southwell in rural Nottinghamshire. More impressive still is the fact that Claire, 40, an international sales director for a homeware company, has not lifted a finger all night. Neither, has she decanted a stash of Waitrose ready meals to pass off as her own. So how has Claire pulled off this amazing feat? Claire's secret is one which a growing number of middle-class women share. Quite simply, they hire a private chef to slave over their stoves so they can sit back and socialise with friends. Claire, who's married to Jonathan, 41, a businessman, is adamant it's the way forward. 'Some might say that paying up to £750 for a dinner party for 12 people is extravagant,' she says. 'But we work long hours and earn good money, and I'm often away in the Far East, so to me it's a small price to pay for buying quality time with close friends. Because I'm worth it: Claire would rather pay someone to cook so she can relax with friends . A selection of Michelle's dishes: From left, ham hock and pea soup, goats cheese wrapped in smoked salmon and mini cheesecakes with raspberries and edible flowers . 'Having someone cook for you in your own home is intimate and indulgent, from the canapes and cocktails to the menu and even how the table is decorated.' Still. Many women would struggle to justify the equivalent cost of a month's food shopping for a family on one dinner party. And if friends are true friends, wouldn't they be equally as happy with a casual lasagne? It would seem not. The popularity of TV shows like MasterChef and The Great British Bake Off has raised expectations of what people should serve at their own dinner parties. A hearty casserole or fish pie just won't cut the mustard any more. Additionally, a recent survey concluded that the average dinner party host spends six-and-a-half hours preparing food. 'There's a significant trend for ordinary middle-class people wanting to hire chefs to cook for special occasions in their own homes,' says Tracy Jewitt of Greycoat Lumleys, an agency that provides house staff including nannies, tutors and butlers. Hired help: Daisy Steel regularly employs chef Annie des Forges, whose company is called The Table. to dazzle her dinner party guests . More relaxing: Daisy says Annie is worth every penny as she can enjoy the dinner party and her friends don't have a harassed host constantly dashing to the kitchen . A year ago, in response to demand, they launched a spin-off business, My Chef, dedicated purely to this. 'Many people told us they're turning to dinner parties again because they're fed up with the waiting lists at high-end restaurants,' she says. 'Others said they'd installed incredible kitchens and dining rooms at great expense yet never made use of them.' Claire Lightbody and her husband moved into their home a year ago. 'We've got a grand dining table that seats 12 and enough bedrooms and bathrooms for our guests to stay over. Many of them bring their little ones with them too and they sleep upstairs while we eat,' says Claire, who doesn't have children herself. Her private chef of choice is Michelle Burge, 40, who describes herself as a home gourmet. She is based in Nottingham and her clients include sports stars. Claire first hired Michelle to accompany the extended family on a break to a cottage in Norfolk in 2011 where they celebrated her father-in-law's 70th birthday. 'We didn't want anyone to be put upon with shopping and cooking so we paid more than £1,000 for Michelle to come with us, which included all the food for the weekend,' Claire adds. 'She produced every morsel that we ate, including making croissants for breakfast, picnic lunches and a posh birthday dinner party.' She and Jonathan have since hired Michelle a dozen times to cater for them, including a five-course meal for Claire's 40th. 'As the host, you invite your friends over because you want to spend time in their company, but when you're doing the cooking you miss out on the conversation,' Claire says. 'Having Michelle means we can fully engage with our friends — she even brings a waitress. 'I've never tried to hoodwink my guests into thinking I've done the cooking, I always make sure Michelle gets the credit.' The total cost sounds a lot, and per head it works out at anything from about £50 to £80 depending how extravagant Claire wants to be with the menu. Naturally she would never dream of asking her guests to contribute financially. Less stress: Caroline Maude calls upon chef Kathryn Rodbert — who runs a company called Madeleine's Kitchen — when she feels she can't stand the heat in the kitchen . No sweat: Caroline says forking out for chefs at home is worth it - especially as they also do the washing up . 'It would be the height of rudeness,' she says. 'I wouldn't cook a meal myself and then expect everyone to chip in. So why is this any different?' Meanwhile, in Frome, Somerset, Daisy Steel regularly hires a chef to dazzle her dinner guests at the farmhouse she shares with husband Jonathan, 43, a software developer, and their five children, Jack, 22, Poppy, 20, Jasmine, 17, Ben, 13, and Joe, eight. 'We first started hiring chefs in our 30s when we lived in London, but since we moved here four years ago and discovered that the social scene revolves around dinner parties, we've done it a lot more,' says Daisy, 43, who works in television. 'While I'm happy cooking Sunday lunch for 20 people, when it comes to dinner parties I'm a perfectionist and put myself under a lot of pressure to shine.' The antidote to Daisy's stress is local chef Annie des Forges, whom she discovered three years ago when she and Jonathan needed someone to create a dinner for 100 people to celebrate 25 years together. 'We were so impressed with her food that we've been hiring her to create small dinner parties for us ever since,' Daisy adds. 'A three-course dinner for ten people works out at about £400 which might sound a lot, but you could spend that going to a gastropub.' Tracy Jewitt concurs that most of the people who hire chefs through Greycoat Lumleys are time-starved professionals in their 30s to 50s. 'They work really hard, so every spare moment is precious,' she says. 'If you think of the bill for dining in a Michelin-starred restaurant, it's much more affordable to hire a chef.' Daisy discovered this the expensive way. Celebrity favourite hotel Babington House — the venue for the weddings of Zoe Ball, Amanda Holden and James Corden — is a mile from her home and last year she organised a birthday dinner there for Jonathan. 'There were 14 of us and the bill, including booze, came to more than £1,500,' Daisy says. 'Yes, it was wonderful, but we can have food cooked by Annie at home that's every bit as delicious and costs half the price.' Is Daisy ever tempted to squirrel Annie out of the back door and pass the food off as her own? 'Never,' she laughs, 'but equally I never feel like it's a cop out. People love it — as a guest you don't want to see your hostess looking fraught as she dashes between dining room and kitchen either.' It's a sentiment shared by Caroline Maude, 50, a freelance theatre consultant. Despite being an avid cook, she calls upon chef Kathryn Rodbert — who runs a company called Madeleine's Kitchen — when she feels she can't stand the heat in the kitchen. 'My husband and I do quite a lot of entertaining, and we love to cook but occasionally, either as a treat or when life is just too busy, we'll hire Kathryn to cater for a dinner party,' says Caroline, who lives near Petersfield in West Sussex with husband Anthony, a theatre set designer, and their children Celeste, 18, Ottoline, 15, and Tallulah, 14. 'The trouble is that we're ambitious about our own cooking which means it's expensive because we buy ingredients such as pheasant and scallops. Two days are wiped out buying the food and preparing dinner, and another half day clearing up the mess afterwards. Hiring Kathryn removes that stress.' Claire Lightbody sums it up: 'It's not just about eating fabulous food that you haven't had to cook yourself — it's the experience of being waited on in your own home. Best of all, there's no washing up at the end of the evening. That's got to be worth every penny.'","Shows like MasterChef has raised expectations of what should be served .

"Disney characters are known as fun-loving and cuddly sorts – but a Spanish man discovered that they are capable of violence if provoked. A heckler in a Madrid square pushed two street performers dressed as Mickey and Minnie Mouse over the edge and got a bloodied nose as a result. A brawl between the three erupted when entertainers Fazzio and Ticiana Yanez lost their temper at the critic, who they said 'just wouldn't leave us alone'. Scroll down for videos . A heckler in a square in the Spanish capital Madrid pushed two street performers dressed as Mickey and Minnie Mouse over the edge and got a bloodied nose as a result . The punch-up – filmed by passers-by – shows Fazzio ripping off his Mickey Mouse head and then grappling with the heckler, getting him in a headlock. His partner then takes off her Minnie head too as she follows the tussle around the square shouting abuse and grabbing at the man's clothing. Passer-by Aristobulo Olivarez said: 'It's certainly not something you see every day.' He added: 'He'd been heckling their balloon bending magic act for some time and it seems they'd had enough.' Police halted the brawl by separating the heckler - later identified as Vero Arreola - and Fazzio, who by now had a bloody nose. Minnie performer Ticiana said: 'We have a good children's show but he just wouldn't leave us alone.' Police spokesman Seneca Nino said: 'Three people have been interviewed over a public disturbance.' Police halted the brawl by separating the heckler (right) and Mickey and Minnie . According to local media the incident, which was widely shared on social media in Spain, could also have unfortunate consequences for the pair after local Disney representatives said they were not licensed, and officials are compelled to take action to ban them from using the cartoon characters in future. It follows footage emerging of a Russian driver being left dazed and confused after he was attacked by a group dressed as cartoon characters including Mickey Mouse and Spongebob SquarePants in a bizarre road rage incident. Footage of the incident, which shows the driver as he stops his vehicle in front of a minibus in the middle of the road, became an internet hit. The unverified footage, filmed on another vehicle's dashboard camera, apparently shows the driver as he gets out of his vehicle and appears to remonstrate with the driver of the minibus. Before long however he finds himself outnumbered as four people dressed as cartoon characters, including Scrat from Ice Age and a Russian character called Luntik, sneak around the side of the minibus before confronting him. The group then appears to proceed to get the better of the driver as they force him to the ground and begin kicking and punching him. Following the attack, which lasts for about 15 seconds, the group appear to get back into the van before it drives off.","Heckler in Madrid pushes two Disney street performers over the edge .

"If you've ever missed that perfect photo, scientists may have the answer. Researchers today revealed a new way to take pictures called compressed ultrafast photography. While current phone can take several shots a second at best, it is able to generate two-dimensional (2D) colour images at up to 100 billion frames per second. Scroll down for video . Laser light moving off a mirror captured using the new camera. the time measurement is in picoseconds - that is one trillionth, or one millionth of one millionth of a second. The team were able to capture laser light reflecting off a mirror for the first time using their new camera . The new technique, described in this week's Nature, could have a large impact in several areas of research by allowing the measurement of otherwise unobservable, time-evolving, phenomena. To demonstrate some of the uses of the technique, the authors imaged laser pulse reflection and refraction, photon racing in two media and faster-than-light propagation of wavefronts. In forensics, CUP might be used in reproducing bullet pathways, which could once again open up the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories and revive a more accurate analysis of the strange physics of the 'magic bullet.' The team at Washington University in St. Louis, led by Lihong Wang, PhD, the Gene K. Beare Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering say the camera is the world's fastest. Wang and his colleagues have made movies of the images they took with single laser shots of four physical phenomena: laser pulse reflection, refraction, faster-than light propagation of what is called non-information, and photon racing in two media. The research appears in the Dec. 4, 2014, issue of Nature. The CUP system configuration. 'For the first time, humans can see light pulses on the fly,' Wang said. 'Because this technique advances the imaging frame rate by orders of magnitude, we now enter a new regime to open up new visions. 'Each new technique, especially one of a quantum leap forward, is always followed a number of new discoveries. 'It's our hope that CUP will enable new discoveries in science — ones that we can't even anticipate yet.' The camera is a series of devices that works with high-powered microscopes and telescopes. Once the raw data are acquired, the actual images are formed on a personal computer; the technology is known as computational imaging. 'This is an exciting advance and the type of groundbreaking work that these high-risk NIH awards are designed to support,' said Richard Conroy, PhD, program director of optical imaging at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, part of the NIH. 'These ultrafast cameras have the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of very fast biological interactions and chemical processes and allow us to build better models of complex, dynamical systems.' An immediate application is in biomedicine. One of the movies shows a green excitation light pulsing toward fluorescent molecules on the right where the green converts to red, which is the fluorescence. By tracking this, the researchers can get a single shot assessment of the fluorescence lifetime, which can be used to detect diseases or reflect cellular environmental conditions like pH or oxygen pressure. CUP photographs an object with a specialty camera lens, which takes the photons from the object on a journey through a tube-like structure to a marvelous tiny apparatus called a digital micromirror device (DMD), smaller than a dime though hosting about 1 million micromirrors, each one just seven-by-seven microns squared. There, micromirrors are used to encode the image, then reflect the photons to a beam splitter, which shoots the photons to the widened slit of a streak camera. The photons are converted to electrons, which are then sheared with the use of two electrodes, converting time to space. The electrodes apply a voltage that ramps from high to low, so the electrons will arrive at different times and land at different vertical positions. An instrument called a charge-coupled device (CCD) stores all the raw data. All of this occurs at the breathtaking pace of 5 nanoseconds. One nanosecond is a billionth of a second. Wang envisions applications in astronomy and forensics, where the advanced imaging frame rate could analyze the temporal activities of a supernova that occurred light years away, or track and predict the movements of thousands of potentially hazardous pieces of 'space junk,' refuse of old satellites and jettisoned space craft hurtling about at high speed in outer space. In forensics, CUP might be used in reproducing bullet pathways, which could once again open up the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories and revive a more accurate analysis of the strange physics of the 'magic bullet.' In the astronomy world, CUP can be a game-changer, Wang said. 'Combine CUP imaging with the Hubble Telescope, and we will have both the sharpest spatial resolution of the Hubble and the highest temporal solution with CUP,' he said. 'That combination is bound to discover new science.'","Can generate 2D colour images at up to 100 billion frames per second .

The firm hopes that a child friendly version of YouTube and its chrome browser could make the internet safer for youngsters. It says it is aiming the news products at under twelves. Google hopes its new products will make it easier - and safer- for children to use the web. A recent study said the iPad has now overtaken household names such as McDonalds and Disney to become the number one brand among American 6-12 year olds. The annual study, conducted by leading youth and family research firm Smarty Pants, ranks more than 250 brands each year. 'The big motivator inside the company is everyone is having kids, so there's a push to change our products to be fun and safe for children,' Pavni Diwanji, the vice president of engineering charged with leading the new initiative, told USA Today. 'We expect this to be controversial, but the simple truth is kids already have the technology in schools and at home,' says the mother of two daughters, ages 8 and 13. 'So the better approach is to simply see to it that the tech is used in a better way.' Google is developing the products in a secret room at its Mountain View,'Googleplex' called the Kids Studio. Diwanji said her own daughter was part of the test group, and has already given the team some guidance after  Googling 'trains' and seeing a list of Amtrak train schedules pop up. 'She came to me and said, 'Mommy, you should tell Google about Thomas the Tank Engine, because Google obviously doesn't know about him,'' Diwanji said.

"This is the shocking moment ISIS militants took sledgehammers to Iraqi tombstones  - smashing them to pieces. The rebels, who are members of the Islamic State terror group, were filmed attacking centuries-old graves in the north-west city of Mosul in Ninevah province. Donning balaclavas and black coats, they swung sledgehammers into the tombs, causing pieces of dust and stone to fly through the air. Scroll down for video . Violent attack: An ISIS militant is filmed taking a sledgehammer to an Iraqi tombstone - smashing it to pieces . One of the devastated tombstones belonged to the Prophet Jonah (Younis in Arabic) and was revered by Muslims and Christians alike, according to Iraqi authorities. The prophet, who is the central figure in the Hebrew Bible's Book of Jonah, is best known for being swallowed by a fish or a whale, depending on translation. The attack is the latest in the ISIS's violent rampage across Iraq. Earlier . this week, a series of images emerged showing the destruction of almost . a dozen Shia and Sunni religious shrines in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, . and the town of Tal Afar, which is also currently under ISIS control. Armed: The rebels, who are members of the Islamic State terror group, were filmed attacking centuries-old graves in the north-west city of Mosul in Ninevah province. Above, an ISIS militant vandalises a tombstone . Smash: Donning balaclavas and black coats, the rebels swung sledgehammers into the green tombstones . ISIS militants believe giving special veneration to tombs and relics is against the teachings of Islam. Speaking of the latest attack, Ninevah official Zuhair Al-Chalabi, told IraqiNews.com: 'The elements of ISIS [have] controlled the . mosque of the Prophet Younis in Mosul since they invaded the city.' '[They] engaged in the process of tampering with the contents of the Mosque. It is . still held by them until now.' The shrine of the Prophet Seth (Shayth) was also destroyed by rebels, according to reports. Revered tomb: One of the devastated tombstones belonged to the Prophet Jonah (Younis in Arabic) and was revered by Muslims and Christians alike, authorities said. Another belonged to the Prophet Seth (Shayth) It . comes as more than 50 bodies have been discovered by Iraqi authorities . in an agricultural area outside the city of Hillah, just south of . Baghdad, today. Military . spokesman Brigadier General Saad Maan Ibrahim said most of the 53 . bodies were found blindfolded with their hands bound and several gunshot . wounds. The grisly discovery in Hillah, a predominantly Shiite city around 60 miles south of Baghdad, has raised concerns over a possible sectarian killing amid the battle against a Sunni insurgency. Brig Gen Maan said an investigation was underway to determine the identities of the dead, as well as the circumstances of the killings. ISIS have been attacking a host of historical sites across Iraq as part of their terror campaign . The dead were all men between the ages . of 25 and 40, and it appeared they had been killed a few days earlier . and then dumped in the remote area, said a local police officer and a . medical official. They officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief the media. A . lightning sweep by the insurgents over much of northern and western . Iraq in the past month has dramatically hiked tensions between the . Shiite majority and Sunni minority. At the same time, splits have grown between the Shiite-led government in Baghdad and the Kurdish autonomic region in the north. Destroyed: The photographs were posted on a website which frequently carries official statements from the Islamic State extremist group . Prime . Minister Nouri al-Maliki today accused the Kurdish zone of being a . haven for the extremists and other Sunni insurgents. The claims are . likely to further strain Baghdad's ties with Kurds, whose fighters have . been battling the militant advance. Mr . al-Maliki lashed out at the Kurds in his weekly televised statement, . saying 'everything that has been changed on the ground must be returned' - a reference to disputed territory Kurdish fighters have taken. He . went a step further, saying: 'We can't stay silent over Irbil being a . headquarters for Daesh, Baath, al-Qaida and the terrorists.' Daesh is . the acronym in Arabic for the Islamic State group, often used as a . pejorative by its opponents, while the Baath was the party of former . dictator Saddam Hussein. But Mr al-Maliki provided no evidence to . back up his claims, which are sure to be rejected by Kurdish leaders in . Irbil. Evidence on the ground also contradicts his allegations. While . the motives in this case remain unclear, such killings hark back to the . worst days of Iraq's sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007. At that time, . with a Sunni insurgency raging, Shiite militias and Sunni militant . groups were notorious for killings of members of the other sect. Bodies . were frequently dumped by roads, in empty lots, ditches and canals. As . the levels of violence dropped over time, such discoveries became rare. But . sectarian tensions have soared once more and authorities have once . again begun to find unidentified bodies since the Sunni militant . offensive swept across much of northern and western Iraq. The . militant surge is led by the Islamic State extremist group, but other . Sunni insurgents have joined, feeding off anger in their minority . community against the Shiite-led government. Prime Minister: Nouri al-Maliki today accused the Kurdish autonomic region in the north of being a haven for the extremists and Sunni insurgents. He said: 'Everything that has been changed on the ground must be returned' On the other side, Shiite militias have rallied around Mr al-Maliki's government to fight back against the militant advance. In . the far north, Kurds have taken advantage of the mayhem to seize . disputed territory - including the city of Kirkuk, a major oil centre - . and move closer to a long-held dream of their own state. Kurdish . fighters say they only want to protect the areas from Sunni militants. Many of the areas have significant Kurdish populations that they have . demanded for years be incorporated into their territory. These moves have infuriated Mr al-Maliki, who is under pressure from opponents as well as former allies to step down. The photographs of the destroyed churches and mosques that emerged last week were posted on a website which . frequently carries official statements from ISIS. Some . of them showed bulldozers plowing through walls, while others featured . buildings being demolished by explosives in a cloud of smoke and rubble. Three Sunni clerics were also killed by ISIS gunmen in Mosul after calling on locals to reject the terror group and refusing to leave the city, authorities said. The victims were Khattab Hassan, 43, Riyadh al-Wandi, 39, and 48-year-old Abdul Ghafoor Salman. Today, archbishops from Baghdad, Mosul and Kirkuk said the violence . in Iraq is hastening the end of nearly 2,000 years of Christianity there . as the few remaining faithful flee Islamic State militants. War and sectarian conflict have shrunk Iraq's Christian population to about 400,000 from 1.5million before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, they said on a visit to Brussels seeking European Union help to protect their flocks. And now, even those who stayed are leaving for Turkey, Lebanon and western Europe, they claimed. The three - Chaldean Catholic Patriarch Louis Raphael Sako, Syrian Catholic Archbishop of Mosul Yohanna Petros Mouche and Kirkuk's Chaldean Catholic Archbishop Youssif Mirkis - are all Eastern Catholics whose churches have their own traditional liturgy but are loyal to the pope in Rome. 'The next days will be very bad. If the situation does not change, Christians will be left with just a symbolic presence in Iraq,' said Sako, who is based in Baghdad . 'If they leave, their history is finished.' More than 50 bodies have been discovered by Iraqi authorities . in an agricultural area outside the city of Hillah, just south of . Baghdad, today.

"A police officer loses his cool and tells a protester to stop rioting because he has known him since he was a boy - in a dramatic exchange during the height of the Ferguson unrest. Officer Greg Casem screamed at the man in his 20s to stop destroying the community they both grew up in. He was unable to contain his emotion and, as his voice cracked, he said: ‘I’ve known you for a long time bro... 25 years I’ve been here. Twenty five years!’ The extraordinary moment - captured in pictures which have come to light today - gives an insight into how hard it has been for Ferguson police to watch their own city burn. These exclusive photos were taken on the second night of unrest after a grand jury decided not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Offcer Greg Casem comes close to cracking during the riots as he comes faces to face with a demonstrator who he had known since childhood . 'You’re killing us! We’re not killing y’all, so stop killing us!’ the 20-something protesters shouted. Officer Casem said: ‘I’ve known you for a long time bro. A long time.

'Twenty five years I’ve been here. Twenty five years!’ the officer said as he came close to tears . Officer Casem, who was not wearing full protective gear, has served in Ferguson for 25 years . He shot dead Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, on August 9 sparking violent unrest that returned last week when no indictment was handed down. Rioters smashed up most of the historic downtown street and burned more than a dozen buildings during a night of mayhem. During the violence last Tuesday they also set alight to a police car and smashed the windows of City Hall during skirmishes around the Ferguson police station. Immediately afterwards officer Casem got into the row with the protester as he pointed to the carnage in front of him. He said: ‘Look at that, look at that!' The protester screamed in his face: ‘How you guna help? How you guna help?’ Officer Casem replied: ‘How are these families guna eat? How are they guna get their diapers?’ In flames: The confrontation was the night after these scenes of destruction in the suburb of St Louis, Missouri, which came after the acquittal of Darren Wilson over the killing of Michael Brown . Gutted: Businesses in the town were badly hit, including this beauty outlet in a strip mall. Officer Casem was upset at the impact on the community of the riots and how it would struggle to rebuild . Alight: This was one of the businesses set on fire by looters and rioters in Ferguson after the grand jury cleared officer Wilson . Destruction: The suburb is now having to rebuild after the orgy of destruction which hit it . The protester moved closer to his face and shouted: ‘You’re killing us! We’re not killing y’all, so stop killing us!’ Officer Casem said: ‘I’ve known you for a long time bro. A long time. Since you were this big (moving hand to waist height)’. The protester screamed back: ‘And you’re still killing us’. Officer Casem became emotional and pointed to his chest as he replied: ‘Twenty five years I’ve been here. Twenty five years!’ Officer Casem is a long serving K-9 policeman in Ferguson and on his Facebook page says he attended the Adventist University of the Philippines, a private Christian college in the Indonesian country. MailOnline understands that officer Casem has seen the protester in his community since he was a boy but does not know him personally. During that night police in Ferguson arrested 58 people including 27 protesters from out of state and one woman from Berlin, Germany. Most arrests were for failure to disperse, though at least one person was taken in after being part of a group that was throwing smoke bombs, flares and frozen water bottles at a line of officers. Some protesters also threw rocks, tent poles, and bottles - some containing urine. Police arrested seven protesters on felony charges, including four for allegedly assaulting an officer and three for armed criminal action.","Officer almost broke down in tears as he confronted a protester on the second night after last week's riots .

"Protesters rallying against police violence following the shooting of black teenagers Michael Brown and Vonderrit Myers held a demonstration at the NFL Monday Night Football  in St. Louis. A large banner reading, 'Rams fans know on and off the field black lives matter,' was hung over of the top of the jumbo video board  during the third quarter of the game between the Rams and the 49ers. A few minutes later, about three-dozen protesters marched with their hands raised in an aisle just below the upper deck in the south end zone. Five police officers followed them. Protest: Ferguson October protesters hold up banners in the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis during the San Francisco 49er's vs St. Louis Rams Monday Night Football game . The group could be heard chanting Brown's name, as well as slogans such a 'hands up, don't shoot', 'shut it down', and 'black lives matter'. Outside the ground protesters waved placards with slogans such as 'Touchdown 4 Mike Brown' and 'Black Lives Matter' before, during and after the game. The protests stem from the August shooting death of Brown, who was black and unarmed, by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Yesterday saw hundreds of protesters rallying in pouring rain as they took to the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, with police making around 50 arrests. Among those arrested was prominent civil activist Cornel West who had joined more than 1,000 people march through the Missouri city to rally against police violence.

The Princeton University philosopher and author was hauled away in handcuffs as protesters called for the arrest of a white police officer who shot dead unarmed teen Michael Brown in August. He was one of at least 50 detained by officers at the demonstrations which went on late into the night. Ahead of his arrest, West told a crowd at Saint Louis University on Monday: 'It's a beautiful thing to see people on fire for justice but I didn't come here to give a speech. I came here to go to jail.' He added that he wanted to help the black youth get their voices heard. 'The larger system has been victimizing and coming at them,' he said. West joined hundreds of protesters taking part in the 'Ferguson October' rally. The Rev. Osagyefo Sekou, a Boston-based minister and activist, was also arrested, MSNBC reported. The protesters are calling for the arrest of a white police officer, Darren Wilson, who killed  Brown. Last week, another black teenager, Vonderrit Myers Jr., also died at the hands of a white police officer - further inflaming tensions.

Speaking out: West ,a Princeton-educated philosopher and civic activist, is caught in a scuffle with police . Rally: Ahead of his arrest, he was pictured marching through the streets of Ferguson with other protesters . Some protesters attempted to block a door to the police headquarters and faced off with law enforcement officers wearing riot gear. Amid the tense standoff, some protesters sang the song 'We Shall Overcome,' an anthem of the civil rights movement of half a century ago. Protesters have numbered in the thousands at some events since Friday in the St. Louis area in demonstrations aimed at drawing attention to what they say is police mistreatment of blacks. A grand jury is considering charges against Wilson, who has been placed on administrative leave. Protesters want Wilson arrested immediately and have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor. The U.S. Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation into Brown's death. Activists have traveled from across the United States to join in four days of protests dubbed 'Ferguson October,' culminating on what organizers call 'Moral Monday' with activities protesters said likely would result in many arrests. On Sunday, at least 17 protesters were arrested by police in riot gear for refusing to disperse during a spontaneous sit-in at a convenience store. Officers said protesters threw rocks, while cops responded with pepper spray, witnesses said. Just hours later, on Monday morning, hundreds of protesters  descended on Saint Louis University campus  and announced they were there to stay.

Emotional: A member of the clergy sobs during a prayer calling for an end to racial injustice during the protest . The university march - which was far larger than previous overnight marches in Ferguson - was the first of what was expected to be a series of acts of civil disobedience around the region on Monday, theNew York Times reported. As they walked through the streets, they shouted: 'Indict, convict, put the killer cops in jail, the whole damn system is guilty as hell.' When they reached the campus, they announced they were staging a sit-in. 'As of right now, this is our spot,' a protest leader beside the clock tower on the campus said at 2am on Monday. 'We're not going anywhere. This is our land. Everybody get comfortable.' Vonderrit Myers Sr., whose son was shot dead in Shaw last Wednesday, told the crowd, 'You make my heart easier,' before he held a four-minute moment of silence. Sunday's arrests were in the same neighborhood where the second shooting occurred. St. Louis police spokeswoman Schron Jackson said 17 people . had been arrested for unlawful assembly early on Sunday at the . parking lot of the QuikTrip convenience store. But Mervyn Marcano, who is handling media relations for a group . that provides jail support for protesters, said at least 19 . people had been arrested. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson tweeted that protesters were throwing rocks at the police - but the . protesters responded on Twitter that they had not thrown anything. Witnesses transmitting live video from the small overnight . protest in the Shaw neighborhood - where Myers was gunned down - showed a few dozen . people sitting on the ground outside the convenience store. Witnesses said some people were hit with pepper spray and what appeared tohave been tear gas, though that could not be confirmed. The shootings - which police say came after altercations with the young men - have cast a spotlight on the state of race relations in the U.S. two years after black 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot dead by a Florida neighborhood watch officer in another high-profile incident in 2012. The events in Ferguson have focused global attention on the state of race relations in the United States and evoked memories of other racially charged cases, including the fatal shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012. More than 1,000 protesters shouted slogans at police on Sunday night into the pre-dawn hours on Monday in St. Louis, near where the white off-duty officer shot and killed Myers last week.

If horse-racing superstar Frankel is commanding £125,000 in stud fees, perhaps football clubs should consider paying a pre-birth premium for the offspring of the game's best players. Is it, then, genetics? Or is it nurture over nature? Paul Ince was enjoying a kickabout with his toddler, Tom, in an apartment in Milan when something struck him. 'I suddenly realised he was left footed – which is rare - and he just loved kicking the ball,' recalls the former Inter and England midfielder, who has seen his boy mature in to a Premier League winger with Hull. 'I then saw how well he travelled with the ball and it all seemed natural – I thought, ""He's got a chance here"".' Martin Keown's son, Niall, 19, is on the books at Reading and has made the bench at senior level. The former Arsenal and England defender also knew from an early age his boy had the makings of a footballer. 'I didn't think when he was born, ""Right, my son is going to be a footballer"",' says the father of two. 'But you do think there might be something in the genes which could transfer. 'You keep an eye on them. You watch closely and there is a way that they move and address the ball. You think, ""Hold on, this looks a natural thing for him to do"". 'But I'm also a strong believer that it's environmental. One of my sons is a footballer, the other is a journalist who knows everything about football – that's the environment they've been brought up in.' Paul Ince (left) was a defensive midfielder but his son, Hull City star Tom (right) is a tricky winger . Reading youngster Niall Keown (right) is a commanding central defender like his father Martin (left) Gus Poyet's son, Diego, is a 19-year-old midfielder who made his debut for West Ham in August. The Sunderland manager agrees with Keown that an immersion in football helps shape character and mindset. 'I think he has got a chance and this is why – it is because he lives, sleeps, eats and breathes football,' says Poyet. 'He doesn't care about anything else other than football. Like his dad! He is always thinking about playing.' Poyet, though, decided against taking Diego with him to Wearside and instead advised him to join the Hammers from Charlton during the summer. Steve Bruce, meanwhile, has twice signed son Alex for Birmingham and Hull. Likewise, Ince managed Tom at Notts County and Blackpool. But Poyet said: 'I would love to coach him, but at the same time it would be unfair on him. 'Do you think the players on the bench would accept it if I'm playing my son? West Ham is a great opportunity.' West Ham's Diego Poyet (right) is looking to emulate his father, Sunderland boss Gus (left) Former Manchester United striker Andy Cole (left) and his son Devante (right), who is also a striker . Keown's son is a centre back, and a no-nonsense one at that. Hagi's boy, 16, is a diminutive playmaker with a wand of a left boot. He plays for Vitorul Constanta – The Future Football Club - in Romania, a club founded in 2009 and owned by his famous father. Kluivert's son scores goals and Van der Sar's is a goalkeeper, both in the Ajax academy. Rivaldo's boy, meanwhile, recently scored a spectacular overhead-kick having first taken control of the ball on his chest, much like his dad once did for Barcelona to complete his hat-trick in a 3-2 win over Valencia in 2001. Zidane's eldest, 19-year-old midfielder Enzo, has trained with the Real Madrid first team and is easy on the eye. There is, however, the odd player who deviates from the father-like-son narrative. Ince Snr was a combative midfielder, Ince Jnr is a pacey wideman. 'I think it's easier for Thomas that he has his own identity,' he says. 'Not many people draw comparison between myself and Thomas any more, because he is so different as a player. 'Although I'll tell you a secret - when I was younger I used to dribble around three or four and put it in the top corner as well! I used to score 40 goals a season but West Ham made me a midfielder who got it and passed it. So I do take some credit!'

A young Joe poses with his dad and the Champions League trophy after Manchester United's win in May 2008 . So how much of a part does senior play in the development of junior? 'We had an area set out at our old house where I could work with him on certain things,' reveals Keown. 'I see a lot of me in there. But now he has to want it for himself. The next step is making your own decisions and being your own player.' There has been an explosion of pushy parents in an age where the financial rewards of making it pro are life-changing. But what about the former players? Keown and Poyet differ, whereas Ince plays good cop and bad cop. 'I am his biggest critic. I am terrible,' admits Poyet. 'I do not look at what he does well, but what he does badly. That's just me.' Leicester's Jack Barmby, son of ex-Liverpool midfielder Nick, came through the ranks at Manchester United . Keown counters: 'I only ever shout ""Well done"". I'm a strong believer in allowing the kids to play and parents should know their place. As a former footballer I also have to step back and know my place. 'I had the other side with my own dad. If I scored five goals, he would say I should have scored six.' Ince adds: 'It was so easy for Thomas when he was very young that I just used to let him enjoy it. Then when it got serious, at about 16, I started having a right go at him – right in his face. 'When I managed him it was difficult to get that balance between father and son, I'd be harsh on him and he'd say things back he wouldn't to another manager.

"Republicans are investigating another Obama administration official who played politics on the job but escaped prosecution when the Federal Election Commission recycled her hard drive before evidence could be recovered. April J. Sands resigned her position as an FEC attorney in April 2014 after investigators confronted her with tweets she sent and a video interview she conducted during work hours, advocating for the election of President Barack Obama and other Democratic candidates – and asking people to contribute to their campaigns. When the FEC's Office of Inspector General began the process of filing criminal charges, however, it found that the agency had destroyed her computer's hard drive before it could be seized. April Sands said during a September 2012 Huffington post video chat, while working for the FEC, that Mitt Romney's presidential campaign lacked 'a unified message,' and claimed 'there's nothing that they can focus on with respect to the economy or anything else' In the midst of the 2012 presidential campaign, the Federal Election Commission lawyer declared that only 'straight white men' ought to vote for the GOP . Lois Lerner, a former IRS official who once mentored April Sands at the FEC, landed in the middle of a lost-emails scandal after the IRS told Congress it had recycled a hard drive containing evidence needed to prosecute her . Lois Lerner, a former Internal Revenue Service official at the center of an alleged years-long plot to politically target tea party groups and other conservative organizations, also has seen her legal picture brightened by the IRS's decision to render the hard drive in her government-issued computer into scrap metal. Lerner, whose missing emails have made her a political lightning rod, was Sands' supervisor  until 2001. FEC documents indicate that as the agency's acting general counsel, Lerner oversaw the younger attorney's work. Following an investigation into her partisan political activity, Sands admitted to the FEC's Office of Special Counsel that she had violated the Hatch Act, a federal law banning partisan politicking by most government employees, and agreed not to seek employment in the federal government for two years. The special counsel wrote that she had 'posted dozens of partisan political tweets, including many soliciting campaign contributions to President Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign.' She also 'participated in a Huffington Post Live internet broadcast via webcam from an FEC facility, criticizing the Republican Party and then-Presidential candidate Mitt Romney.' An FEC attorney who is still employed by the agency told MailOnline on Monday that Sands was known in the agency as 'the most enthusiastic pro-Obama lawyer we had.' 'Everyone called her Obama girl,' said the lawyer, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak on the record. 'She probably didn't worry about seeming too rah-rah and running afoul of the law,' he added, 'because she bragged to anyone who would listen that the Obama 2012 campaign was going to hire her away from the FEC.' The attorney also said that Sands and Lerner 'were definitely acquainted with each other' when the two worked together in the agency's Office of General Counsel. 'There were two mid-level associates that Lois Lerner latched on to at the time,' he recalled, 'and one of them was April. Last year when Lerner got into hot water at the IRS, April made a point of telling everyone that her old boss got railroaded by the Republicans on the [Capitol] Hill.' The Oversight Committee wrote in a statement Monday that 'it is unclear whether Ms. Sands ever communicated with Ms. Lerner after Ms. Lerner moved to the IRS; however, the Committee is aware that Ms. Lerner maintained communication with some former FEC colleagues.' Sands, a University of Texas at Austin Law School graduate, locked down her social media profiles on Monday after the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform blasted out a letter to FEC Chairman Lee E. Goodman asking how sensitive evidence in a likely criminal case wound up in a recycling bin. Sands retweeted this partisan jab during work hours on March 5, 2013 . Sands used her personal Twitter account during the work day to publicly slam 'every single Republican ever' Sands, an FEC attorney, was identified during a September 21, 2012 Huffington Post broadcast only as a 'lawyer' from Washington, D.C. The prolific tweeter has sent more than 232,000 messages on Twitter since March 2010, but it was just a handful of tweets she sent her 8,500 followers that got Sands into trouble. 'I just don't understand how anyone but straight white men can vote Republican,' read one she wrote in June 2012. 'Dear every single Republican ever,' Sands tweeted a month earlier, 'When will U learn that Barack Hussein Obama is simply smarter than U? Stand down. Signed, #Obama2012.' In August 2012 she wrote on Twitter that 'If you're still calling yourself a Republican after the #WarOnWomen, their stated RNC platform, & Birtherism, you are my enemy. Done.' 'Birtherism' is a reference to a belief among some on the Republican Party's far right wing that Obama was born overseas, making him ineligible to serve as president. Sands' Twitter feed, now shut from public view, indicated a gradual transition from online cheerleading for the Obama White House to direct campaigning and fundraising, all of which came during work hours. In March 2013 she tweeted a graphic produced by the Blue Street Journal, an obscure progressive blog, displaying an image of a light bulb and a riddle. 'How many Republicans does it take to change a light bulb?' it read. 'None – they'd rather sit in the dark and blame it on Obama.' But by July 2012 she was in full campaign mode, tweeting an indirect appeal for contributions toward Obama's re-election. 'Our #POTUS's birthday is August 4,' she wrote. 'He'll be 51. I'm donating at least $51 to give him the best birthday present ever: a second term.' 'You are my enemy': The taxpayer-salaried attorney tweeted her opposition to Republicans . Among Sands' more egregious violations of the Hatch Act was this fundraising notice sent in July 2012 while she was at work at the Federal Election Commission . Protected: Sands locked down her Twitter account on Monday afternoon . Minor change: Three months ago Sands' Twitter profile identified her as an 'Obama supporter' The following month, as a Missouri U.S. Senate race descended into chaos following comments by the anti-abortion Republican candidate Todd Akin about whether pregnancy could result from rape, Sands directly appealed to her followers for contributions to defeat him and return Democrat Claire McCaskill to the Senate for a second term. 'Donate to @clairecmc today,' she wrote, reacting to news that Akin had decided not to drop out of the race. It is a crime for any employee of the federal government 'to solicit or receive a donation of money or other thing of value in connection with a Federal, State, or local election, while in any room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties.' Convictions can result in a $5,000 fine and three years in prison. Seven weeks before Election Day, Sands declared on Twitter that the presidential race was effectively over. 'Romney is toast,' she tweeted on September 18, 2012, 'But POTUS can't do it all on his own. Don't forget Congressional races. We need a Democratic sweep. Stay focused.' Three days later Sands appeared in the Huffington Post broadcast as part of a six-person panel discussing political news via Google video chat. 'There are so many distractions that the Romney campaign is bringing forward,' she complained. 'The problem is, I think, that because they don't have a unified message there's nothing that they can focus on with respect to the economy or anything else.' April Sands graduated from law school the University of Texas at Austin and was admitted to the Washington, D.C. bar in 1994, according to the Martindale-Hubbell directory . Not just Obama: Sands tried to help Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill raise money for her November 2012 re-election battle . Seven weeks before Election Day in 2012, Sands declared on Twitter that 'Romney is toast,' but urged her followers to also support Democrats in down-ticket races . Asked whether it was wise for former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin to appear on Saturday Night LIve, Sands responded that the one-time Alaska governor 'was comedic in and of herself, because she was a walking gaffe machine.' And on the perennial candidacy of the 'Celebrity Apprentice' host, she took no prisoners. 'I'm still trying to understand how Donald Trump is an expert on anything but bankruptcy,' Sands said. It's just really hard to take him seriously. ... Some people really believe what he says. And that's the scary part.' The Federal Election Commission's Office of Inspector General later determined that she participated 'via webcam from an FEC conference room ... while on duty.' Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican, demanded on Monday that the FEC turn over '[a]ll documents and communications referring or relating to the recycling of Ms. Sands's hard drive, including all correspondence between or among FEC employees and outside vendors or contractors involved in the recycling.' On Monday after Issa re-opened Sands' three-month-old professional wound, she tweeted a message about her new career goals. 'I want to teach people how to use Twitter. How to tweet & grow & stuff,' she wrote, drawing retweets from friends. 'Someone find me a job doing that. Thanks.'","April Sands was a Federal Election Commission lawyer before she resigned this year and accepted a ban on holding government jobs until 2016 .

'My family and I include him and his family in our prayers and I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss.' Pantaleo had been stripped of his gun and badge and will remain on desk duty pending an internal police investigation that could result in administrative charges. Scroll down for videos .

At right, the aftermath of Pantaleo's chokehold . Police union officials and Pantaleo's lawyer argued that the officer used a takedown move taught by the police department, not a banned maneuver, because Garner was resisting arrest. They said his poor health was the main reason he died. The Justice Department is investigating whether Brown's civil rights were violated through excessive force. As the grand jury decision drew near, police officials met with community leaders on Staten Island to head off the kind of violence seen in Ferguson, where a grand jury decided not to indict the white officer who shot the black teen. Demonstrations there resulted in more than 100 arrests and destruction of 12 commercial buildings by fire. It is rare for either federal or state prosecutors to charge a U.S. police officer for excessive force, even when a death results. Distraught: Pantaleo asked Garner's family in a statement Wednesday to try as accept his condolences. Here, Benjamin Carr, stepfather of Eric Garner, leaves the district attorney's office after a grand jury's decision not to indict Pantaleo .

At right, Benjamin Carr speaks to reporters on the phone in the wake of the grand jury decision not to indict Pantaleo . The U.S. Supreme Court and lower courts have over decades ruled that police officers should have wide latitude to use violence to defend themselves and to take suspects into custody. 'There are a lot of cases where police officers don't get indicted for what looks like extreme situations,' said Aaron Mysliwiec, president of the New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. 'Many jurors and judges tend to believe police officers more than your average witness.' In ruling Garner's death a homicide, the city medical examiner said police officers killed him by compressing his neck and chest. His health problems, including asthma and obesity, were contributing factors, the medical examiner said. The video of Garner's arrest shows him arguing with police officers, saying, 'Please leave me alone,' and later, 'Don't touch me,' before a group of four officers tackled him to the ground. He then began to plead with them, saying repeatedly, 'I can't breathe.' Police said later that Garner had been resisting arrest. The official was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio separately said he had been told by Justice Department officials that the federal investigation into the death will now move forward.

"Liverpool and England defender Glen Johnson fears the club may try to sell him in January as manager Brendan Rodgers shows no inclination to offer the 30-year-old defender a new contract. Johnson’s current deal on an estimated £100,000-a-week runs out at the end of the season and he has yet to hear from the club about a renewal. Rodgers brought in two Spanish full-backs Javier Manquillo and Alberto Moreno in the summer and Johnson is virtually resigned to not be offered a new contract despite being settled personally on Merseyside after signing for Rafa Benitez in 2009. Glen Johnson, on an estimated £100,000-a-week at Liverpool, fears the club may try to sell him in January . Young Spanish full backs Alberto Moreno (left) and Javier Manquillo (right) were signed in the summer . Brendan Rodgers has given Johnson no sign that he will hand him a new contract, which expires next summer . With Liverpool one of several clubs under investigation by Uefa for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations, Rodgers shipped out other Benitez high-earners Pepe Reina and Daniel Agger in the last window. The Anfield club would love to recoup some money on Johnson in the January transfer window although the player would be entitled to run down his contract and become a free agent in the summer. He is free to speak to overseas clubs in the New Year if he wanted to emulate his former England colleague Ashley Cole who has joined Serie A club Roma on a Bosman. Johnson has recently returned to action after missing six weeks with a thigh injury and comes up against his former manager Harry Redknapp today (Sunday) as Liverpool travel to QPR. The right-back, capped 54 times by his country, won the FA Cup with Portsmouth under Redknapp in 2008 and has sympathy for his old boss who is expected to get the sack if Liverpool win at Loftus Road. Johnson says there is 'no manager like Harry Redknapp', who he once played under at Portsmouth . Johnson has struggled with injuries this season and hasn't featured much this season . Daniel Sturridge will be out for at least three weeks . ‘I don’t think there’s anyone like him,’ said Johnson. ‘I’ve worked with some very good managers but Harry’s like your mate. That’s why he gets a lot out of players. ‘He gets more out of certain people just by making you feel welcome and looking after people every day. ‘Of course it’s disappointing if he’s under pressure. It’s not nice to see anyone maybe losing their job, certainly not someone like Harry. He’s been a fantastic manager for years and if anyone is going to get QPR out of trouble it will be him, so I don’t know what sacking him would achieve. ‘He’s always been a fantastic manager for me and one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met. When I asked to leave Chelsea and went to Portsmouth, Harry was a big help to me. He gave me the chance to play every week and that’s what young players need to do. ‘When I had a dip in form, Harry put a nice little video together, which made a few of the lads laugh. It was good banter but it made me realise what I should be doing and I was able to crack on. Sometimes simple things like that can make a big difference.’ After last season’s unexpected Premier League title challenge, Liverpool have lost three of their four away games so far this season and struggled to cope with the loss of Luis Suarez and injury to Daniel Sturridge, who is out for a further month with a calf injury. Redknapp's QPR are bottom of the table and welcome Liverpool to Loftus Road on Sunday . Johnson admits balancing domestic football with a busy Champions League schedule has been difficult to come to terms with. ‘We only had the Premier League to concentrate on last season while the other so-called top-four teams were playing games every four days. It was easier to keep everyone fit and we almost had our best eleven every week. ‘With the game load this season, it is not going to be as simple. You will get more injuries and hard to have all the squad out on the training ground. We haven’t picked as many results as when we started last season but that is down to the amount of games and losing a few bodies.’ Liverpool have a glamour European fixture coming up against Real Madrid at Anfield on Wednesday but Johnson says they can’t afford to think about that yet. He added: ‘We have to treat the next game against QPR as the priority. We have to make sure we win that and then we can concentrate on Madrid. We have to do just as well in the league as we have in the Champions League.’","Glen Johnson's £100,000-a-week contract runs out next summer .

"Former senior IRS official Lois Lerner had deeply held political biases while she was in a position of authority, according to Republican lawmakers who unveiled emails on Wednesday showing her referring to conservatives as 'crazies' and 'a**holes.' Michigan Rep. Dave Camp, who chairs the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder to demand what he called 'a serious investigation' – something he said has been lacking. Camp wants Holder to appoint an outside special counsel to probe the culture of the IRS and explain why hundreds of conservative groups were subjected to intrusive questioning and years-long delays when they applied for nonprofit tax benefits – steps that were not taken against liberal organizations. Scroll down for videos . A**HOLES: Former IRS official Lois Lerner let loose on conservatives several years into her agency's alleged intense targeting of them for their political beliefs . He told the attorney general on Wednesday that the newly disclosed email correspondence 'shows Ms. Lerner's mistreatment of conservative groups was driven by her personal hostility toward conservatives.' The November 9, 2012 email exchange with an unnamed colleague – the person's name was redacted in the copy Camp's staff released publicly – took place while Lerner was in the United Kingdom. 'Overheard some ladies talking about American[s] today,' Lerner wrote. 'According to them we've bankrupted ourselves and a[re] through. We'll never be able to pay off our debt and are going down the tubes.' Turning sarcastic, Lerner pounced on her British acquaintances. 'They don't seem to see that they can't afford to keep up their welfare state either,' she wrote. 'Strange.' The conversation turned ugly when Lerner's writing companion let loose first on conservatives. 'Well, you . should hear the whacko wing of the GOP,' the person replied. 'The US is . through; too many foreigners sucking the teat; time to hunker down, buy . ammo and food, and prepare for the end.' 'The right wing radio shows are scary to listen to.' 'Great,' Lerner wrote back. 'Maybe we are through if there are that many a**holes.' 'And I'm talking about the hosts of the shows,' came the reply. 'The callers are rabid.'

"Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald apologized on Tuesday for telling a homeless veteran that he served in U.S. Army Special Forces. 'Special Forces? What years? I was in special forces,' McDonald said when the homeless man told him he had served among the Army's elite troops. The late January comments were caught on camera for a CBS piece about the continued large numbers of homeless veterans. But McDonald never served in Special Forces, and on Tuesday he held a press conference to beg for forgiveness and explain the lie. 'I made a mistake and I apologize for it,' he said. 'I have no excuse for it.' 'It was a misstatement, it was a mistake,' he told reporters. Scroll down for video . Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald (pictured, left, and right, in his 1975 yearbook photo) admitted that he lied when he told a homeless man in Los Angeles that he had served in the Army special forces as well . McDonald had already admitted to embellishing his resume on Monday, telling The Huffington Post, 'I incorrectly stated that I had been in Special Forces. That was inaccurate and I apologize to anyone that was offended by my misstatement.' 'I have no excuse,' he told the news publication. 'I reacted spontaneously and I reacted wrongly, [with] no intent in any way to describe my record any different than it is,' McDonald, who left the Army in 1980 and eventually became CEO of Procter & Gamble, said. 'As I thought about this later I knew this [claim] was wrong,' he said of his exchange with the unidentified homeless man. The secretary completed Army Ranger training but never served in the elite force. He instead became a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division after his graduation from West Point. Asked on Tuesday if he considered resigning over the flap, McDonald was demure, and he ignored a reporter who asked if he had spoken with the president. The White House stood behind McDonald on Monday and again on Tuesday when pressed by reporters to weigh in. 'Secretary McDonald has apologized for the misstatement and noted that he never intended to misrepresent his military service,' it said in a statement Monday. 'We take him at his word and expect that this will not impact the important work he's doing to promote the health and well-being of our nation's veterans.' Noting McDonald's past service, White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Tuesday said the VA Secretary 'understands first hand the sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make' and again lent him the White House's support. 'There's no reason to think that the mistake he made should interfere with his ability to lead the fight for our veterans,' Earnest said. McDonald also got the support of a top Republican on House Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committees. 'The secretary's misstatement was an error, but it doesn't dim the fact that he served honorably,' said Rep. Mike Coffman, also a veteran said. 'We should all take him at his word and Washington shouldn't spend the next two weeks arguing about it.' Coffman said that McDonald 'has a job to do — clean up the scandal-plagued VA,' and 'this latest controversy shouldn't shift one iota of focus away from that long overdue task.' McDonald's interaction with the unidentified man was captured on camera by CBS, who were doing a story . McDonald was appointed by President Barack Obama last year and the White House released a statement saying 'We take him at his word and expect that this will not impact the important work he's doing' Army Special Forces, also called the Green Berets, are highly trained units analogous to the Navy SEALs or the Marine Corps' Raider Regiment. Instead of answering to the ordinary chain of command, they fall under the Department of Defense's U.S. Special Operations Command. McDonald replaced former Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki last year, after he resigned amid a scandal over long wait times for veterans at VA hospitals. Revelations about McDonald's false service claims follow the suspension of NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams for repeatedly telling a false story about being shot at during the war in Iraq. Williams later said that his helicopter was right behind one that was shot at, which was also not true. A story published by the left-wing magazine Mother Jones this week also questioned whether Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly has been truthful about his reporting of the Falklands War. The new secretary's appointment followed Eric Shinseke's resignation amid a scandal over waiting times at VA hospitals . Journalists who were on the ground with O'Reilly at the time have rushed to his defense, however, agreeing with his version of events. Conservatives on Twitter, who mocked Williams by creating photos of him at the moon landing and other impossible places, voiced their frustration with the news about McDonald. 'Brian Williams remembers going out on a special forces mission with Robert McDonald,' Washington, D.C. political fundraiser Nathan Wurtzel said. Special forces members generally become upset when soldiers who did not serve in one of the four designated special operations forces claims they did. Retired Army Col. Gary Bloomberg called McDonald's remarks 'a boneheaded statement' but said service members' anger would not be as strong as in other cases where soldiers wear medals they did not earn. A statement from the American Legion National Commander Michael D. Helm said, 'He did complete Ranger training and served honorably with the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division. But a lie is a lie. 'I can’t believe people do this. What a disappointment from the leader of a department whose number one issue right now is the restoration of trust. He should be held to a higher standard,' the head of the nation's largest veterans organization said. 'The secretary has apologized, as he certainly should. We hope that he can restore the trust that he has lost.'","Robert McDonald, who took over VA last year, told homeless veteran that he, too, served in Army Special Forces .

"The language of love has gone digital through text messages and social media – and it's even affecting the way we flirt. Research has found we are more likely to poke someone on Facebook than ask them out on a date. And the poll revealed that the reason for the trend is that 38 per cent find chatting to someone we fancy too embarrassing. Technology  is leading to people shunning the direct approach for less bold ways of telling a potential date that they are interested with many opting for a Facebook poke rather than asking someone out for a drink . The poll was commissioned by online comparison site broadbandchoices.co.uk who surveyed 2,000 British adults. Almost one in five people said they mostly use private Facebook messages to communicate while dating, while others thought a phone call or text message was more forward than a face-to-face chat. Just over a quarter said they opt for Snapchat when trying to impress someone they like. Researchers from Brigham University recently found that relationships may suffer because hi-tech communications can lead to couples 'disconnecting' with each other on serious issues. 'The bottom line is that if you don’t have something nice to text, better not text at all,' concluded the report. The report found that for women, using text messages to apologise, work out differences or make decisions was associated with a more unhappy relationship. For men, very frequent texting was associated with a poor relationship. However, both men and women agreed that expressing affection via text enhanced a relationship. While 50 per cent of people are confident enough to ask someone for a date face-to-face, a third confessed they would be too embarrassed or nervous to pick up the phone and call a love interest. However, the poll also revealed modern technology does have its downside when it comes to flirting. One in seven people admitted they had accidentally sent a 'naughty' message to the wrong person - with more than a fifth of red-faced flirters sending it to a parent, while one in 10 admitted sent it to the 'wrong' partner. Brits can be sheepish when it comes to ending relationships too with one in eight owning up to dumping a partner by text, while one in 20 (five per cent) said they had sent a private Facebook message, and a brutal three per cent admitted posting a public break-up message on Facebook. Behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings said: 'If you're confident and looking for something fun and casual over the Christmas season, WhatsApp and Snapchat are great places to start. 'If you want something potentially a little more meaningful - or don't want to reveal, or see, anything naughty - stick with text messages or Facebook. 'If you want someone to know that you mean serious business and you're prepared to be bold, pick up the phone. 'It shows real effort and confidence - and could lead to a festive fumble.' Old fashion approaches like talking face-to-face or even picking up a telephone appear to be a dying art as people prefer to hide behind technology when asking out a potential date for a drink . A quarter of people use Snapchat to impress a potential date rather than talking to them face to face, however, using technology can backfire when users send naughty messages to a parent or another partner by mistake . Even when in relationships, Brits are self-conscious with more than half the people polled (53 per cent) saying they wouldn't have 'in a relationship' on their Facebook profile after six months of being together, with almost a quarter (23 per cent) citing the reason as feeling they hadn't been together long enough. A further seven per cent even said they felt a year wasn't long enough to announce their relationship on Facebook. Dominic Baliszewski, telecoms expert at broadbandchoices.co.uk, said: 'Digital dating and social media have only been around for a relatively short time but it is fascinating to see how they have altered the way we interact with one another, particularly for people seeking new relationships. 'All that online interaction can eat through your mobile data, so make sure you have a plan with enough of a download allowance to avoid any untimely interruptions to your service.'","Poll surveyed 2,000 adults and was commissioned by broadbandchoices .

"The United States Department of Justice announced Wednesday it had launched an investigation into the death of Eric Garner at the hands of New York City police. The announcement came in the wake of a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer, Daniel Pantaleo, who placed Garner in a chokehold that ultimately led to the 43-year-old father of six's death. Also at the heels of the decision, President Obama said it underscores the need to strengthen the trust and accountability between communities and law enforcement. Scroll down for video . Addressed the issue:  At the heels of the grand jury decision not to indict the officer whose chokehold led to Eric Garner's death, President Obama said it underscores the need to strengthen the trust and accountability between communities and law enforcement . The president even went so far as to concede that in some cases, despite much of society's wish to believe otherwise, police racial bias does exist. 'In some cases those might be misperceptions,' the president said. 'But in some cases that's a reality' The president even went so far as to concede that in some cases, despite much of society's wish to believe otherwise, police racial bias does exist. Obama says police have to deal with crime every day, but says they can do their jobs better if people have confidence in the law enforcement system. 'In some cases those might be misperceptions,' the president said while speaking to the White House Tribal Nations Conference. 'But in some cases that's a reality.' Obama says he discussed the grand jury's decision Wednesday with Attorney General Eric Holder. While not commenting on the decision specifically, he said there are 'too many instances where people just do not have confidence that folks are being treated fairly.' Politico reports that the DOJ probe will be conducted by the department's civil rights division and the U.S. Attorney's Brooklyn office. The controversy began when a deadly encounter in July on Staten Island, New York City's smallest borough, was captured on video, and quickly spread over the Internet fueling debate about how U.S. police use force, particularly against minorities. Obama says he discussed the grand jury's decision Wednesday with Attorney General Eric Holder. A DOJ probe into the Eric Garner case will be conducted by the department's civil rights division and the U.S. Attorney's Brooklyn office. Here, Attorney General Eric Holder speaks during the opening session of The White House Tribal Nations Conference on December 3 . Last week, a grand jury in Missouri decided not to indict a white police officer in another racially charged killing of a black man. The decision in that case sparked a spasm of violence in Ferguson, Missouri, with businesses burned down and looted. Staten Island resident Eric Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, died on July 17 after police officers tackled him and put him in a chokehold. The city's medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. New York City police prepared on Wednesday for protests that could potentially paralyze major roads and tunnels in the city. About two dozen demonstrators lay down in the middle of Grand Central Station's main hall in Midtown Manhattan in a silent protest as the evening rush hour began, as commuters crisscrossed through the terminal. President Barack Obama, while not directly commenting on the case, said the grand jury decision spoke to 'the concern on the part of too many minority communities that law enforcement is not working with them and dealing with them in a fair way. 'We are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of trust and strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and our law enforcement,' he said. Staten Island resident Eric Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, died on July 17 after police officers tackled him and put him in a chokehold. The city's medical examiner ruled the death a homicide . The district attorney for Staten Island, Daniel Donovan, announced the grand jury's decision not to indict the white police officer, Daniel Pantaleo, who placed Garner in a chokehold. 'It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner,' Pantaleo said in a statement released by the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association union. Benjamin Carr, stepfather of Garner, said he was distraught over the verdict. 'Put it in the hands of the federal government. Let them do something about it,' he said. At the site where Eric Garner was apprehended by police and a makeshift memorial to his honor now stands, tempers flared as about a dozen protesters expressed their anger at the grand jury's decision with a protest on the sidewalk. Some demonstrators defiantly crushed cigarettes in front of reporters and passersby - a reference to the reason that police gave for approaching Garner in the first place. It is rare for either federal or state prosecutors to charge a U.S. police officer for excessive force, even when a death results. 'There are a lot of cases where police officers don't get indicted for what looks like extreme situations,' said Aaron Mysliwiec, president of the New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. 'Many jurors and judges tend to believe police officers more than your average witness.' Protesters lay down in Grand Central in response to grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in Eric Garner's . New York City police prepared on Wednesday for protests that could potentially paralyze major roads and tunnels in the city. About two dozen demonstrators lay down in the middle of Grand Central Station's main hall in Midtown Manhattan in a silent protest as the evening rush hour began, as commuters crisscrossed through the terminal . The U.S. Supreme Court and lower courts have over decades ruled that police officers should have wide latitude to use violence to defend themselves and to take suspects into custody. In ruling Garner's death a homicide, the city medical examiner said police officers killed him by compressing his neck and chest. His health problems, including asthma and obesity, were contributing factors, the medical examiner said. The video of Garner's arrest shows him arguing with police officers, saying 'please leave me alone,' and later 'don't touch me' before a group of four officers tackled him to the ground, at which point he began to plead with them, 'I can't breathe.' Police said later Garner had been resisting arrest. Donovan said he had applied for a court order to authorize the release of 'specific information in connection with the Garner grand jury investigation.' He noted in his statement that under New York law he is not permitted to disclose any details of a grand jury proceeding. The grand jury, like all in New York, had 23 members. At least 12 grand jurors must agree to bring an indictment. Donovan said that all 23 grand jurors attended every one of the sessions in the Garner case, which began on Sept. 29 and ended on Wednesday. Impassioned: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio arrives to a news conference in which he addressed the Garner case. In a direct and sometimes passionate speech from Staten Island, de Blasio risked the ire of the NYPD by making his dissatisfaction with the failure of the jury panel not to charge Officer Daniel Pantaleo abundantly clear .","Obama said the Garner decision underscores the need to strengthen the trust and accountability between communities and cops .

"A Spanish-language leaflet that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has provided to the Mexican Embassy in Washington advises border-crossing Mexicans that they can collect taxpayer-funded food stamp benefits for their children without admitting that they're illegal immigrants.Underlined and in boldface type, the document tells immigrants who are unlawfully in the United States that, 'You need not divulge information regarding your immigration status in seeking this benefit for your children.'The USDA's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, is funded in order to prevent hunger by helping poor families maintain a basic level of nutrition for both adults and children. Congress spent $86.5 billion on the SNAP program in 2012, by far the largest single line-item in the USDA's $205 billion overall budget . The underlined portion reads: 'You need not divulge information regarding your immigration status in seeking this benefit for your children' The Agriculture Department says SNAP benefits are only to be distributed to U.S. citizens and other legal residents. On its website, it acknowledges an education 'partnership' with the Mexican government, but insists that its aim is to help educate only 'eligible Mexican nationals living in the United States' about nutrition benefits for which they might qualify. That education partnership is carried out through a program called 'Ventanillas de Salud,' meaning 'Windows to Health,' implemented through 50 Mexican consulates in the U.S. Judicial Watch obtained the Spanish language leaflet through a Freedom of Information Act request. An attached email dates the document to March 2009, just months after President Barack Obama took office. In an email, a spokesperson for the SNAP program told The Daily Caller, which first reported on the leaflet, that “non-citizens who are unlawfully . present, are not, nor have they ever been, eligible to receive . Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. U.S. Border Patrol agents walk fences on the Mexican border, and detain illegal immigrants - including children - before returning them to south of the border. A majority will try to cross the border again . The leaflet, released late Thursday by the conservative group Judicial Watch, will raise questions about the Obama administration's commitment to limiting the expenditure of taxpayer funds to eligible Mexican nationals - meaning those with legal permission to reside in the United States. 'The revelation that the USDA is actively working with the Mexican government to promote food stamps for illegal aliens should have a direct impact on the fate of the immigration bill now being debated in Congress,' Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in a statement. 'These disclosures further confirm the fact that the Obama administration cannot be trusted to protect our borders or enforce our immigration laws. And the coordination with a foreign government to attack the policies of an American state is contemptible.' Fitton's group also obtained a March 2010 USDA flyer advertising a taxpayer-funded online seminar for nonprofits serving Hispanic communities. The teaching session, promoted as being 'free for all participants,' taught activists how to get USDA funding to provide free lunches during the summer. The federal government's SNAP program served about 43.6 million people in November 2010. Before the recession, the program had just 26 million enrollees. The USDA licenses food retailers like this Oregon grocery store as SNAP program participants . And in a March 2012 communication, Judicial Watch said, the USDA asked the Mexican Embassy to approve a letter addressed to that country's 50 consulates. That letter encouraged staff at those Mexican diplomatic missions to learn in another webinar how to encourage more of 'the needy families that the consulates serve' to enroll in the SNAP program. Judicial Watch said Thursday that the 2012 document did not discriminate between legal US residents and illegal immigrants. In August, Agriculture Under Secretary Kevin Concannon rolled out a new range of anti-fraud programs aimed at preventing food stamp funds from going to ineligible recipients. 'USDA has a zero tolerance policy for SNAP fraud,' Concannon said when announcing new measures to clamp down on abuse of the program that he promised would 'help us hold bad actors even more accountable than in the past and discourage them from abusing the public's trust.' The agency's press release, however, made no mention of efforts intended to deny SNAP benefits to illegal immigrants. People line up for their monthly debt cards and food stamps all over the country . Former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack is President Obama's Secretary of Agriculture and is responsible for the SNAP program's operation . Last year Alabama Republican Senator Jeff Sessions complained in writing to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack that, 'It defies rational thinking for the United States – now dangerously $16 trillion in debt – to partner with foreign governments to help us place more foreign nationals on American welfare.' An estimated 11 million illegal immigrants are living in the United States. President Obama and a bipartisan group of eight U.S. Senators are gathering support for comprehensive immigration reform  legislation that would put most of them on a path to legal residence and, conservatives allege, both amnesty and citizenship.","Conservative legal group obtained Agriculture Department flyer .

"Holidaymakers are being urged not to panic after leading ski resorts across the Alps and the Pyrenees delayed their openings by at least a week due to a lack of snow. Upmarket resorts such as Courchevel and Meribel had planned to open on December 6, but are now pushing that back to December 13. It comes after unusually warm temperatures caused early snowfall in November to melt. A live webcam at the Courchevel resort in France shows virtually no snow on the slopes today . In some areas, slopes have been left almost entirely bare. However, travel experts said that the delays in opening would not affect British holidaymakers as the ski seasons for the majority of UK tour operators don’t start until late December. Instead, it is typically only locals who use the slopes in the first two weeks of opening. Lynsey Devon, a spokesman Heaven publicity that represents a number of leading ski resorts, told the MailOnline: ‘Most tour operators don’t sell holidays that begin before December 20. Meribel's webcam also showed bare slopes today, although experts insist snow is due in the coming days . Snow-making machines have been placed on the slopes of Gschwandtkopf mountain in western Austria . Snow-making machines stand on a snowless slope on Gschwandtkopf mountain in western Austria last week . ‘It’s only locals who use the slopes in the first couple of weeks, but they don’t buy ski holidays – they just turn up, so they won’t be out of pocket. ‘The resorts obviously don’t want weekend skiers using up the snow if there has been very little falling on the slopes, so by delaying the opening of the resorts they are preventing that from happening. ‘Widespread snowfall is expected in the coming days, in some cases there will be up to 80 percent cover. ‘If the worst does happen, resorts like Courcheval have invested in cutting edge snow machines which are capable of covering slopes in inches of artificial snow from bare grass in a matter of hours.' Despite their efficiency, the machines are estimated to cost up to £5 per cubic metre of manmade snow. ‘They have invested around £3million in Snow Factory machines which can fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in just thirty minutes,’ said Ms Devon. France remains the most popular ski destination for British skiers, and 400,000 tourists from the UK chose Austria as their ski destination last year. News of the delayed opening comes after the Montgenevre resort in France revealed it has postponed its opening indefinitely, along with others in the region. ‘We opened on the weekend of Nov 22. Then the rain and thaw damaged the snow at the bottom of the slopes,’ said a spokeswoman for Montgenevre, near Italy. Courchevel is one of France's most popular ski resorts and is usually covered in thick snow at this time of year . According to the national weather service, there is very little snow below 2,000m for this time of year - and in some cases none at all - but snowfall is forecast for the end of the week. And in the eastern Jura range, the Metabief resort has also decided to open later for the same reasons. Snow-making machines have already been placed on the slopes of Gschwandtkopf mountain in the western Austrian village of Seefeld in a bid to try and attract holidaymakers. Meribel in the French Alps has also been struggling with the unseasonably warm weather this year . Similar problems have affected other Austrian resorts, including Flachau in Salzburg and Rosskopf mountain in Tirol, at a time when the snow is usually plentiful. Tourism bosses have blamed the lack of snow on unusually warm winter weather. But temperatures in the Alps were recently revealed to be rising faster than anywhere else in the world, with Alpine resorts attempting to adapt to climate change. A recent Austrian climate report found the country’s temperatures had risen twice as fast as the global average since 1880, with the number of sunshine hours in the Alps increasing by 20 per cent.","Courchevel and Meribel set to open on Dec 13th, a week later than planned .

I used to have 10 yards of space and no-one around me and used to do six or seven stepovers, but there's no point if you're not putting the ball in the back of the net. 'You've got to realise that if you do little tricks, you're going to get kicked in the Premier League. You've got to really know how to pass and keep the ball moving without getting caught and getting silly injuries.' Raheem on footballers unfairly getting stick . 'I don't think some people realise the journey that some footballers have come on. Most people have started aged 7, 8, 9 or 10 and some make it to the last important step and some don't, so it's really [a] make or break [situation] initially that we're in. 'We work for it from a young age and people don't see it until we're in the public eye, so they're probably just thinking that we're born into playing football really, but it's a journey we've come on. 'We do put hours in off the field as well and try to give back as much as possible as we do on the field.' Raheem on his friendship with Jamaican sprint stars . 'He's [Warren Weir] a good friend of mine and when I go to Jamaica, I try to see him or Usain as much as possible. If we're not out together, we're just having a laugh.' Would he ever take on his friends on the track? ""No, no! That's something I wouldn't fancy doing really - that's why they're in the sport they're in really, because they're the best at what they do.' 'I haven't had a chance to get a kickabout with them yet, but I heard Usain thinks he's a big player,' he says in response to Bolt's claims that he'd like to play for Man United. 'Yeah, I've heard that quite a few times.' Raheem on ignoring the hype . 'It's nice to hear the things people say but I don't really take it in too much. I just try to block it out and concentrate purely on football, to improve and try to make people talk even more.' Raheem on his unique running style . 'None of them [team-mates] have gotten to me yet about that, but we always have a joke and a laugh about different stuff. I haven't been bantered so much about that, I've more had that on social networks.” FOR THE FULL RAHEEM STERLING INTERVIEW, THE NEW ISSUE OF FOREVER SPORTS IS ON SALE NOW FROM ALL GOOD NEWSAGENTS AND SPORTS DIRECT STORES, PRICED £2 .","Liverpool midfielder Raheem Sterling says he is 'always working out'

"While they might seem poles apart, the lexicon of beauty is surprisingly similar to the jargon of DIY. From brushes, gloss and varnish to primers, tape and files, it’s all about preparing the surface and then making it more attractive. In a DIY store last week, I noticed the similarity between sandpaper and the foot file I use for removing rough skin off my feet — but at a fraction of the price. It made me wonder if B&Q could actually be the cut-price beauty store I’d been searching for. I decided to experiment, with some fascinating results . . . BODY BRUSH . Beauty: Elemis Skin Brush, £21, timetospa.co.uk . B&Q: 5-inch Masonry Brush, £3 . Every beauty expert I’ve met swears by body brushing — using a stiff bristle brush in sweeping strokes, working from the tips of your toes and fingers towards the heart. It’s said to boost lymphatic drainage, resulting in less water retention, and promote circulation so skin looks more radiant. Some people even believe it can improve the appearance of cellulite. Normally I use the Elemis Skin Brush but I thought that a stiff plastic-bristled masonry brush could do the job just as well. And while it’s definitely less aesthetically pleasing, the bristles feel just like more expensive cactus ones of the Elemis version, although they bend more easily because they’re longer. Winner: B&Q —although only after I’d cut the bristles down to half their size. But when you’re saving £18, it’s worth a little effort. FAST-DRYING HAIR TOWEL . Beauty: Aquis Lisse Hair Towel, £14.95, amazon.co.uk . B&Q: Kent Car Care Extra Large Chamois Leather, £12.78 . Hair obsessives rave about microfibre towels that absorb water from the hair more quickly than normal towels. I’ve never been particularly convinced that mine does this. Working on the principle that a chamois leather, usually used for washing cars, readily soaks up water, I used one, as I do the towel, to create a turban after washing my hair. The results were miraculous. Fifteen minutes later, most of my hair was dry, in half the time it usually takes. The wet leather smelled a bit, well, leathery, but didn’t make my hair smell odd. Winner: B&Q. I’m chucking out my microfibre towel. FAKE TAN APPLICATOR . Beauty: St Tropez Applicator Mitt, £5, sttropeztan.co.uk . B&Q: Mini Roller & Tray Set, £2.75 . To avoid stained palms, the only way to apply fake tan is with a mitt — a pocket with a plasticised inside and a fabric exterior. Rather than squirting some of my usual mousse onto a mitt, I poured a little liquid tan into the tray of a miniature roller set and set about covering my legs. It was useless. The roller soaked up far too much liquid, and the coverage was patchy. Perhaps a paint pad, less absorbent than a roller, but also used for daubing walls, would have been better? Winner: Beauty — efficient, if less fun than decorating yourself. FAKE TAN MITT . Beauty: St Tropez Buffing Mitt, £3.57, sttropeztan.co.uk . B&Q: Kent Home Care Microfibre Mitt, £1.38 . If you’ve never been for a professional fake tan, you might not have encountered a finishing mitt. When you have been sprayed a deep mahogany colour, the therapist takes a soft mitt and pats down your skin, gently buffing away tell-tale streaks, rather as if you were a newly-waxed Bentley. It might sound absurd, but it makes the difference between a good finish and a perfect finish, so I now do the same at home. I used a mitt designed for polishing a car. Apart from being bright blue, rather than tasteful black, and about twice the size of the St Tropez version, it worked brilliantly. The microfibre fabric felt soft against my skin and the internal seam, which allows you to put fingers either side. Winner: B&Q — easy to use and covers a bigger area. FRENCH MANICURE NAIL STICKERS . Beauty: 96 Nailene Perfect French Tip Guides, £3.05 . B&Q: Masking tape, £1.76 . While expert manicurists might be able to create the perfect French manicure — pale pink with white tips — we more cack-handed types often turn to little stickers that act as a guide so you get a perfect line. It’s what decorators do with masking tape, but on a smaller scale. Using masking tape on my nails gave a straight line rather than the traditional curved one, but the tape stuck well to the nail, the polish didn’t seep underneath, and I quite liked that the straight line gave a more modern effect. Winner: B&Q — though if you’re a purist, you might want to shell out for curved stickers. CLEANSING CLOTHS . Beauty: Three Muslin Cleansing Cloths, £14, evelom.com . B&Q: Ten Dishcloths, £1.98 . Eve Lom’s waxy cleanser, launched in 1983, pioneered the trend for greasy, balm-like cleansers that are removed with warm water and a muslin cleansing cloth. Now everyone from Elemis to Boots and Liz Earle does a hot-cloth cleanser. The problem is that even if you regularly boil-wash them, the pricey cloths soon become grubby. Could a regular cotton dishcloth do the same job? I’ve been using one for a week and I’ll never go back to muslin again. The cotton was soft on my face and gives a gentle exfoliation. Winner: B&Q — much as I love Eve Lom, I won’t be paying the best part of £5 for muslin when a 20p cloth does the same thing. FLEXIBLE ROLLERS . Beauty: 12 Bendy Rollers, £4.09, superdrug.com . B&Q: Verve 7m Plant Twist Tie, £4 . Years ago, I used bendy rollers to create soft curls. It was simple: you took the curler — essentially a wire-covered sponge — wound a towel-dried section of hair round it, starting at the bottom and working toward the roots, and then bent over the ends of the roller to hold the hair in place. Then you let the hair dry before releasing the curls. I thought padded wire for plants might be able to do the same thing. I knew the wire was thinner than the normal rollers, but thought bending it over on itself might work. But although I managed to wrap my hair around it, no matter how many ways I bent it, the hair wouldn’t stay put. And, to make matters worse, the rubber coating on the wire gripped the hair and caused it to pull and tangle. Winner: Beauty — bendy rollers are a relatively simple design, but they’ve proved they’re more than just a twist of wire. FOUNDATION BRUSH . Beauty: Urban Decay Good Karma Optical Blurring Brush, £18, debenhams.com . B&Q: Harris 25mm Paint Brush, £3.98 . The soft, tightly-packed bristles of Urban Decay’s brush do a wonderful job of buffing foundation into the skin so you get a flawless finish. The same couldn’t be said for the paintbrush I attempted to use in its place. While actually it was pretty good at daubing my warpaint on and didn’t, to my surprise, leave streaks, it was scratchy and uncomfortable to use. Winner: Beauty — unless you really want your foundation application to double as exfoliation. FOOT FILE . Beauty: File A Foot, £5, thebodyshop.co.uk . B&Q: Norton Expert Angled Sanding Sponge Fine, £3.98 . Surely I can’t be the only one who’s looked at an emery board or a foot file and thought, ‘Isn’t this just pricey sandpaper?’ I went for a fine-grained sanding sponge, worried that anything too gritty might actually draw blood. The angled block was ‘ideal for sanding contoured surfaces, corners and hard to reach areas’ — it sounded perfect. I used the large surface on the bottom of my feet, and the pointed bit to tackle hard skin on the tips of my toes, and it was just as effective as my normal foot file. Winner: A draw — while the block did exactly what I needed it to, and was much better at tackling toes, the foot file’s longer handle made it easier to scrub my heels.","The lexicon of beauty is surprisingly similar to the jargon of DIY .

"Tottenham could be without Andros Townsend when they return to Premier League action for their clash with West Brom on Sunday. The Spurs winger started in the club's 0-0 Europa League group stage opener at Partizan Belgrade but was replaced short of the hour mark by Erik Lamela after picking up an upper leg injury.

'It was Fazio's first game, like Stambouli, and they play for the first time. It's always difficult to make your debut but I'm happy with the performance.' Spurs made 10 changes to the side which drew 2-2 at Sunderland last week, but Pochettino rebuffed any suggestions he underestimated the Serbian outfit. 'It was difficult to play and move the ball fast and quick, but that's no excuse,' Pochettino continued. 'I never underestimated Partizan. We played with a team we thought would get three points. I believe that three points was most important but we'll analyse the game. 'Besiktas an Asteras drew their game too. We need to look forward to the next game.'

"A British jihadi fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq has become notorious on social media for his love of junk food - confessing that he even dreams about  KFC and Nandos while waging jihad. Known by the nom de guerre Abu Hamza al-Britani, the 21-year-old Londoner of Pakistani origin is regularly teased about his insatiable appetite by his fellow ISIS militants, who have branded him 'fat' and advised him to stop eating so much ice cream. As well as his apparent gluttony, Abu Hamza's other favoured topic of conversation is the pet kitten he left behind when travelling to fight on the frontline. The terrorist has repeatedly posted messages about and photographs of the ginger cat named Anbar, which he described as 'my princess'. Although Abu Hamza spends much of his time talking about his pets and uploading photographs of junk food, the terrorists shares the same chilling desire to die in the name of radical Islam as other Britons fighting for the terror group, with his Twitter biography claiming he is 'seeking Martyrdom'. Hungry: A photograph on social media shows Abu Hamza (left) wearing the traditional hat of the Pashtuns, and a dark robe. He is eating ice cream with his close friend Abu Hamza as-Somali in the IS held city of Mosul . As well as his apparent gluttony, Abu Hamza's other favoured topic of conversation is the pet kitten he left behind when travelling to fight on the frontline. The terrorist has repeatedly posted messages about and photographs of the ginger cat named Anbar, which he described as 'my princess' Food on the brain: Abu Hamza al-Britani has become notorious on social media for his love of junk food - confessing that he even dreams about KFC and Nandos while waging jihad . Abu Hamza's endless appetite and obsession with junk food has seen his fellow militants repeatedly poke fun at his weight. 'You're pretty fat. You should lay off the ice cream,' one of his Twitter followers posted recently. Abu Hamza appears to take such criticism in his stride, however, responding to the user with: 'Is it my fault you're eating salads like a rabbit?' In another exchange, Abu Hamza was asked: 'If you had to eat only three things for the rest of your life, what would you eat?' The militant responded with: 'Unhealthy. Spicy wings, cake, chips.' Such is his love of calorific cuisine that even Abu Hamza's Twitter page is decorated with food, including what appear to be barbequed chicken legs and rice. In a recent post he told his followers about a dream he'd had where he was ordering food from KFC, Nandos and his favourite Thai restaurant. He added that his favourite types of foods are 'Indian, Thai and Italian.' When one of his followers asked if he was fat, Abu Hamza replied: 'No, praise be to God. But I love food and I'm cooking as I type.' Minutes later he revealed he was boiling vast quantities of pasta. Masked and armed: On his Ask.Fm account, Abu Hamza revealed that he had waited for five months to tell his mother that he had joined ISIS. When he eventually did, the terrorist claims his mother burst out laughing in disbelief before suggesting that she supported his actions by branding him and fellow jihadis 'lions' Jihadi jibes: Abu Hamza's endless appetite and obsession with junk food has seen his fellow militants repeatedly poke fun at his weight . Glutton: Abu Hamza never seems to miss an opportunity to eat something unhealthy, even admitting that he gorges on junk food while working as a guard and fighting for the terror group . Abu Hamza never seems to miss an opportunity to eat something unhealthy, even admitting that he gorges on junk food while working as a guard and fighting for the terror group. 'Cheese and onion crisps, tropical juice on the floor with my klash [AK47],' he recently wrote before adding:  'Reloading my PKC chain [heavy machine gun] with bullets being fired at us through the wall and I'm asking @hamza_somali ""what we having for Dinner brother?"".' Abu Hamza often uses his private Twitter account to share photographs of his food, which ranges from large pots of Indonesian noodles to hearty Russian stews. He has revealed a great deal of personal information about himself on social media, telling followers that his family originally come from Lahore in Pakistan, he is 5ft 5in tall, and that his mother was incredibly anxious when he first went to Syria, adding that he prayed God would 'calm her heart'. On his Ask.Fm account, Abu Hamza revealed that he had waited for five months to tell his mother that he had joined ISIS. When he eventually did, the terrorist claims his mother burst out laughing in disbelief before suggesting that she supported his actions by branding him and fellow jihadis 'lions.' A photograph on social media shows Abu Hamza wearing a pakul, the traditional hat of the Pashtuns, and a dark robe. He appears to be eating ice cream with his close friend Abu Hamza as-Somali in the IS held city of Mosul. Abu Hamza later wrote on Twitter that the Somali fighter was his 'closest brother since I've been in jihad. Done everything together. May Allah grant us shahada together too.' Cat lover: Named 'Anbar', after Iraq's largest province, the wispy ginger and white stray cat was adored by Abu Hamza, who posted photographs of her sleeping next to a box of bullets . Roots: Recently asked whether he missed anything about London, Abu Hamza replied: 'Miss all the different food and family.' The unmarried fighter also revealed he wanted 'two or three' children . Despite his apparently light-hearted approach to social media, the 21-year-old maintains a solid belief in the extremist values that define the Islamic State terror group . An avid social media user, 'Hungry Hamza' is a keen fan of Instagram - promoting his account as offering 'a real insight into what the mujahideen of the IS get up to.' Whilst Abu Hamza enjoys showing off photos of his food, it is his cat that has attracted most of the attention to his social media accounts. Named 'Anbar', after Iraq's largest province, the wispy ginger and white stray was adored by Abu Hamza, who called her 'my princess' and posted photographs of her sleeping next to a box of bullets while terrorists around her load their guns. He described the cat as 'crazy' and 'a big problem' - explaining that she was 'up all night running around and when she does sleep she only wants to sleep right on top of you.' The fighter's emotional attachment to his cat, proved a roblem when he had to leave her behind to go fight for the terrorists group on the frontline. A devastated Abu Hamza posted a final photo of Anbar, saying: 'I will be leaving my princess today. She's still small but I've had her since she was a baby...I know it's gna [sic] be hard to leave her.' Abu Hamza has revealed that he has lived in both ISIS' Syrian stronghold of Raqqa and the Iraqi city of Mosul. When asked to compare the cities, Abu Hamza said: 'Raqqa is very social it has everything you need. A bit too much dunya [multiculturalism] for me. Mosul is beautiful. It's more for the quiet.... kind of family.' Recently asked whether he missed anything about London, Abu Hamza replied: 'Miss all the different food and family.' The unmarried fighter also revealed he wanted 'two or three' children. Despite his apparently light-hearted approach to social media, the 21-year-old maintains a solid belief in the extremist values  that define the Islamic State terror group. He insists he and his fellow fighters are 'blessed with better homes than the White House and 10 Downing Street combined' and encourages young women to join him in the Islamic State, telling them that it is safe for them to travel alone.

The militant has also told how ISIS fighters play pranks on one another when they're not fighting, recalling an occasion when one terrorist put washing up liquid in a bottle of mouthwash. 'You can imagine what happened next. I'm still coughing bubbles,' he said.

"Some silken-haired beauties are eager sidekicks to motorcycle riders, wind whipping their thick locks as passers-by watch the wild ride with envy. That is until the slobber starts. These passengers are pooches - mastiffs, Labradors and Chihuahuas often clad in goggles and tiny leather jackets that fly along in blimp-shaped buckets attached to the side of motorcycles. They are set apart from other pets by speed instead of breed. They are also the stars of Sit Stay Ride: The Story of America's Sidecar Dogs, a documentary that was largely funded by an online crowdfunding campaign and gives a quarter of its proceeds to shelters and rescues. Scroll down for video . Cool ride: Mooloo, a Standard Poodle, rides with Rhonda Reynolds in a 2005 Triumph Tiger motorcycle in Spooner, Washington . The movie is also available for free to any animal welfare agency wanting to screen it as a fundraiser. The documentary by filmmaking couple Eric and Geneva Ristau is the unique story of 15 dogs and 18 riders who spend all the time they can on three wheels. Ian Roper, 43, of Snohomish, Washington, and his bull mastiff Bruce love to take it easy on a slow ride. It's a departure for Roper, who said he raced cars and motorcycles for years in Detroit and Snohomish, a city northeast of Seattle, to enjoy the speed and feel of the open air. 'It is much slower than a motorcycle, but it is a much more relaxed ride,' Roper said. Bruce, who's nearly four and weighs 135 pounds, keeps it interesting on the road. When they are in the forest, the dog will react if he detects a deer or other wildlife.

'He is tied in so he can't run off, but he'll stand up if he smells something interesting,' Roper said. If tree branches hang over the road, 'he will grab at leaves as they go by. When we get where we are going, the sidecar is half-full of leaves. It's a game to him.' Things get really fun when they come to a stop sign or park at a store and a crowd gathers around. Everyone is laughing and pointing at Bruce in his sweet ride. Then, the dog will start shaking his head, splattering slobber on the crowd or their cars. Smiles fade, people move away and cars drive off. 'I never really thought about a sidecar until I got a dog, but I will never be without one again,' Roper said. They started their travels when Roper got Bruce as a puppy and decided it would be fun to hit the road with his dog. So the mechanical design engineer took classes and bought a $14,000 customized motorcycle-sidecar. Don't let the price tag scare you off, he says, anyone can get started for $6,000. Roper has a stable of seven motorcycles - fast ones for his own use and the sidecar for Bruce, which has racked up 10,000 miles.

Dude: Artie a rescued Newfoundland, rides in a side car with Rebecca Hodges and Joe Baker in Redding, California . Country jaunt: Gary McLuen, with his dog Jake the Wonderdog, in a 2008 BMW GS/A motorcycle in Port Townsend, Washington . Riding with a dog is a different experience, he said. They can't move around a lot or they will tip. 'Bruce leans into corners when we turn, and I would love to think he was doing that to help out, but I think he does it because he doesn't want to fall over,' he said. The Ristaus, of Missoula, Montana, spent nine months filming Roper and Bruce and the other riders in Wisconsin, North Carolina, Ohio and Washington state. They condensed about 50 hours of interviews into the finished film of 84 minutes. When they started, the couple didn't know they would get so hooked on the unique rides that they would get their own sidecar, too.

"They are two giants of the animal kingdom, but that did not stop this male elephant and black rhino from clashing dramatically in a fearsome fight at a park in  Africa. Amateur photographer Louis Kok and his wife Marthie captured these extraordinary photographs of the large elephant attacking the female rhino - flipping it into its back and leaving it with its legs in the air. The couple from Pretoria, South Africa, were photographing a rhino cow and her calf when the testosterone-fuelled, one-tusked elephant approached. Scroll down for video . Tossed and turned: The large male elephant charges at the female rhino and flips it onto its side . Relentless: The testosterone-fuelled beast lays into the mother rhino, who was protecting her calf . African assault: The one-tusked elephant attacks the rhino with its truck as it lies injured in the dust . Protective mother: The rhino was attacked while trying to protect her calf from the rampaging elephant . The pair were stunned to watch the peaceful scene transform into a brutal battle as the bull elephant charged at the protective rhino mother. Mr Kok said: 'Male elephants on musth, fuelled by exorbitant levels of testosterone, are extremely dangerous, and will attack anything which stands in their path.' Musth is a condition during which bull elephants experience a huge rise in reproductive hormones - testosterone levels can reach up to 60 times higher than normal - and this makes them extremely aggressive. Stunned: Amateur photographer Louis Kok and his wife Marthie did not expect the fight to break out . Immobilised: The helpless rhino is left prostrate, lying on its back after the elephant's brutal attack . Cowering: The rhino calf watches on, hiding in the shrubs as the elephant attacks its mother . Baby blues: The calf emerges in search of its mother as the elephant peers on it the background . 'The elephant immediately toppled the rhino which landed helplessly on its back with its legs in the air,' Mr Kok continued. 'The elephant kept rolling the defenceless rhino around in the dust, while crushing it repeatedly under its enormous weight - in a traumatising display of speed, agility and brutal power.' After the fight the rhino's calf rushed to its injured mother's side. 'The calf remained in the vicinity for some time, circling her mother and attempting repeatedly to help her up,' Mr Kok said. I love you mum! The baby rhino rushes to its mother's side once the scene is safe and the elephant has gone .

The pair reported the incident to the management of the park, who said that the rhino did miraculously manage to get up around two hours after the attack. The following day she was spotted about 300 metres from the scene of the fight, but unfortunately died a few days later from her injuries. The couple were requested not to identify the park to prevent the influx of poachers into the area.","Large male elephant attacked female rhino which was protecting its calf .

"The Islamic State has set up terror training camps in Libya after the U.S. admitted that more than one hundred militants have gathered in the country. ISIS has already overran large areas of Iraq and Syria and a today a top US general confirmed that the Islamic extremists had set up in eastern Libya with the American military monitoring the situation closely. Western countries have been increasingly worried that Libya's political turmoil could provide fertile ground for Islamic extremists, but General David Rodriguez ruled out military action on the 'nascent' camps in the immediate future. Scroll down for video . The group has largely focused on Iraq and is currently fighting for control of Kobane in Syria but there are fears they are spreading into North Africa . The head of US Africa Command told reporters at the Pentagon: 'They put training camps out there', referring to ISIS who have seized territory in Iraq and neighboring Syria this year in a brutal and swift offensive of beheadings and forced religious conversions. 'ISIS has begun its efforts over in the east out there to introduce some people over there. 'But we'll have to just continue to monitor and watch that carefully in the future to see what happens or whether it grows on unabated.' He described the IS activity in eastern Libya as 'very small' but added that there were 'around a couple hundred' militants present at the camps, with US forces continuing to track the area. The United States has been waging an air war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but when asked if the training camps in Libya were a potential target for American forces, Mr Rodriguez replied: 'No, not right now.' The four-star general said it appeared the ISIS militants in Libya were not volunteers coming from outside the country but militia members who had shifted their loyalty to the jihadist group. His comments came after the US government and European allies voiced 'grave concern' over mounting violence and civil unrest in Libya. ISIS has already seized huge swathes of land in Iraq and Syria, including the town of Raqqa, pictured . Experts have warned that ISIS has gained a foothold in the eastern town of Derna, exploiting the chaos that has engulfed the North African state. Libya has been plagued by instability since the overthrow of autocratic leader Moamer Kadhafi in 2011, and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi recently boasted of vows of allegiance from militants in the country. Analysts say a number of factions in Derna have pledged loyalty to the group, but it remains unclear how much support they enjoy. ISIS, which aims to establish an Islamic caliphate across the region, is the prime target of the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria. The group has attracted a wave of global revulsion after a series of horrific executions of Western hostages filmed and released online, as well as gruesome videos depicting the beheadings of Syrian and Iraqi forces. While largely based in Iraq and Syria, the IS organization has also attracted pledges of allegiance from militant groups in Egypt, with the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Partisans of Jerusalem) group last month vowing support for the group. He described the IS activity in eastern Libya as 'very small and nascent.' 'Around a couple hundred' militants were present at the camps and US forces would continue to track the area to see if the IS presence expanded, said Rodriguez. The United States has been waging an air war against the IS group in Iraq and Syria, but when asked if the training camps in Libya were a potential target for American forces, Rodriguez said: 'No, not right now.' The IS group 'has begun its efforts over in the east out there to introduce some people over there,' he said. 'But we'll have to just continue to monitor and watch that carefully in the future to see what happens or whether it grows on unabated.' The four-star general said it appeared the IS militants in Libya were not volunteers coming from outside the country but militia members who had shifted their loyalty to the jihadist group. His comments came after the US government and European allies voiced 'grave concern' over mounting violence and civil unrest in Libya. Experts have warned that the IS group has gained a foothold in the eastern town of Derna, exploiting the chaos that has engulfed the North African state. Commander of the United States Africa Command General David Rodriguez, who has warned that ISIS has set up terror training campaigns for militants in eastern Libya . Libya has been plagued by instability since the overthrow of autocratic leader Moamer Kadhafi in 2011, and IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi recently boasted of vows of allegiance from militants in the country. Analysts say a number of factions in Derna have pledged loyalty to the IS group, but it remains unclear how much support they enjoy. IS, which aims to establish an Islamic 'caliphate' across the region, is the prime target of the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria. The group has attracted a wave of global revulsion after a series of horrific executions of Western hostages filmed and released online, as well as gruesome videos depicting the beheadings of Syrian and Iraqi forces. While largely based in Iraq and Syria, the group has also attracted pledges of allegiance from militant groups in Egypt, with the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Partisans of Jerusalem) group last month vowing support for the group. By Larisa Brown, Defence Reporter for The Daily Mail . More British troops will be sent to help the Iraqi security forces as part of a large-scale mission to defeat Islamic State jihadists. Military trainers will teach the Iraqi army how to counter deadly roadside bombs as the British Army steps up its role in the country, leading to claims of ‘mission creep’. They will join four large American training bases that will be established within weeks to train and advise the Iraqi army on a wider scale. Details are yet to be finalised but an announcement is expected in the coming days. Lieutenant General Gordon Messenger told the Defence Select Committee yesterday: ‘The training and support that we are providing has been requested by both the Kurds and central Iraqi Government. 'The Americans will see the establishment of four big training bases - one of which will be in Erbil. 'As part of that we see ourselves delivering niche specialist training in the area which is much needed, particular in IEDs. 'We are still scoping the exact nature of that but we hope to have some concrete proposals in the coming days.' He added: 'We are sending the reconnaissance forces out there to ensure that at the time when are training is needed we will be able to deliver it.’ In terms of numbers, they were still looking at both ‘light’ and ‘heavy’ options, he said. Islamist jihadists have started laying IEDs to take out Iraqi forces as part of a change in tactics after UK airstrikes blasted their vehicles and killed their fighters. British soldiers – who have learnt how to detect the deadly bombs after fighting against the Taliban in Afghanistan – have been asked to help by the Iraqi government due to their specialist knowledge. The deputy chief of defence staff said British forces were also looking at other training possibilities as part of the UK’s contribution to a ‘large scale venture’ in training anti- Islamic State forces. He added: 'I think importantly it is demand led… we are delivering the type of training that these forces have asked for and need.’ Hundreds of British forces will also be sent to join American troops in training thousands of Syrian moderates outside the country. Defence sources said both Saudi Arabia and Jordan could host the training grounds but details are yet to be finalised. Peter Watkins, Director General of Security Policy, denied the further deployment of UK forces to ‘advise and train’ Iraqi security forces was ‘mission creep’. He told MPs: ‘Whatever we do has to be guided by the objectives we set out at the first place. 'I think if we remain guided by the objectives we can avoid mission creep.’ Lt Gen Messenger said air strikes had helped demoralise Islamic State –but had forced the extremist fighters to change tactics. He said: ‘The effect on the morale of both those organisations has been significantly enhanced by those air strikes.’ There had been an ‘equivalent reduction’ in the morale of IS, who were now using guerrilla tactics such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs). ‘They were much more out in the open and even held military parades in certain areas’ Lt Gen Messenger said. ‘That has stopped. They are resorting to more asymmetric tactics, including the use of IEDs. They are using quite extensive countermeasures to avoid them being struck, moving at night, using the weather, avoiding grouping in big areas.’","ISIS has set up terror training camps for militants in eastern Libya .

"In a move to compete with fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle and Five Guys, McDonalds is testing a new tablet ordering system which allows customers to customize their burgers with 20 mix-and-match ingredients like guacamole and tortilla chips. McDonald's started testing the new system last year at two Orange County stores and recently expanded to two restaurants in San Diego, but the project could be rolling out to other stores soon as the chain battles its lowest sales slump in more than a decade. Experts say the Build Your Burger feature is designed to appeal to younger customers, which have stopped patronizing McDonald's in favor of fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle where they can chose the ingredients that go into their order. McCustomizable: The Build Your Burger feature allows customers to choose from 22 different ingredients to make their sandwich the way they want it. Above, a picture of the fast-food chain's signature Big Mac . 'The problem for chains like McDonald’s is that with this generation, the Millennials in particular, the standard of expectations has risen,' John Gordon, owner of Pacific Management Consulting Group, told U-T San Diego. 'The standards that were OK for our parents, aren’t necessarily OK for us.' The ordering system still has a few kinks it has to work out, like the fact that customers who want to also order off the main menu must submit their order at the counter, instead of just using the Build Your Burger tablet. At the restaurants currently offering the DIY burger option, employees stand at the front of the store explaining the tablet ordering system. All burgers are made with patties used for the Quarter Pounder sandwich, and are freshly grilled for every custom order. Customers then have a choice of buttered and toasted  bun (artisan or brioche), cheese (American, sharp white cheddar, pepper jack), and an assortment of other mix-and match toppings like guacamole, grilled mushrooms, pickled jalapenos and garlic aioili. Can I have your order please? Above,  Build Your Burger ordering systems seen above in one southern California McDonald's restaurant . Touch start: Customers start the Build Your Burger ordering process by using a tablet, as seen above . Beef: All of the Build Your Burgers are made with the same beef pattie used in the Quarter Pounder sandwich . Bun: Customers have a choice between an artisan bun and a brioche bun. Both are buttered and toasted to order . Cheese: Instead of plain American, which McDonald's uses on its other cheeseburgers, customers can opt out for sharp white cheddar or natural pepper jack . Extras: Other toppings include guacamole, grilled mushroom and tortilla strips . Spreads: Spicy mayo, creamy garlic sauce, ketchup, regular mayo, mustard and special sauce are among the choices of spreads . Smoky: Bacon is the only addition that costs extra in the Build Your Burger process . The only topping that costs extra is bacon, which adds 80 cents to the order. The total cost of these burgers average around $5.49. When the burger is prepared, employees deliver it to the customer's table in a metal basket instead of handing it out on a plastic tray at the counter. And when the customer is finished eating, an employee comes out again to bus the able and to ask about the experience. The new ordering program appears to be an attempt to address dropping sales at the fast-food chain. Experts say McDonald's is trying out the program to compete with fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle, which give customers more options on their orders. Above, a line at Chipotle shows how customers choose their burrito toppings . This month, McDonald's posted its worst same-stores sales decline since 2003, and sales at stores open at least 13 months dragged 3.7 per cent in August. The slow sales may be due in part to the young Millennial generation's preference for fast casual restaurants. The percentage of customers aged 19 to 21 has fallen each month by 12.9 per cent since the beginning of 2011, and has remained flat for the 22 to 27 age group. 'McDonald's sales are declining, so they're looking for another way to generate revenues and reach a different crowd,' Joel Cohen, president of the Cohen Restaurant Marketing Group, told the Chicago Tribune.","The fast-food chain started testing the program at two Orange County, California restaurants last year and recently expanded to two more .

"With their near-death experiences and tumultuous love lives - plus the odd major disaster - soap characters seem to have nine lives. But even when they are killed off, it’s rarely the last we’ll see of the actors who play them. When soap stars announce they’re quitting the show for bigger things, it’s not Hollywood that’s beckoning, but Holby City or EastEnders. As ex-Emmerdale actress Claire King joins Coronation Street, we chart the fortunes of those stars who can’t make a clean break from soap... Claire King joined Emmerdale in 1989 as super bitch Kim Tate (right). She quit after ten years, and from 2005 she was in Hollyoaks, in which she played no less than three roles. This month Claire, 51, will become a Corrie regular as barmaid Erika . Ross Kemp was famed as EastEnders hard man Grant Mitchell (left with Martine McCutcheon). He quit in 1999 and returned twice before making documentaries about real gangs. Kemp played an Army deserter in Emmerdale in 1986 (right) Back in 1983, Beverley Callard briefly played Angie Richards, a chip shop cashier in Emmerdale with a big mouth and bigger hair (right). Since 1989 she’s been in and out of Corrie as landlady Liz McDonald, famous for her plunging necklines (left) From 1992-96, Denise Black played Corrie’s siren hairdresser Denise Osbourne (pictured right), with a comeback in 2007. Last year, she crossed the Pennines and arrived in Emmerdale as Joanie Wright (left), the adoptive gran of Adam Wyatt’s son, Kyle . It’s hard to imagine June Brown as anyone other than Dot Cotton (pictured left), the chain-smoking launderette lady in EastEnders — a part she has played for 30 years. But in 1970, she was briefly in Coronation Street (right) with Ena Sharples . In EastEnders, Michelle Collins was Cindy, Ian Beale’s cheating wife (right) from 1998 until she was killed off in jail ten years later. In 2011, she joined Corrie as Stella Price (pictured left with screen husband John Michie), quitting this year . As put-upon housewife Sheila Grant, Sue Johnston made her name in gritty Liverpudlian soap Brookside between 1982 and 1989 (centre). In September 2012 she joined the Street, playing randy granny Gloria Price for 18 months (left), although she’d already appeared in the soap three times in 1982 (right) Long before she started cutting hair in Weatherfield, Sue Nicholls played Marilyn Gates, a waitress in Crossroads, in the mid-Sixties (left). Since 1985 she’s been Corrie regular Audrey Roberts (pictured right with Bryan Mosley as Alf Roberts) After 25 years as the Street’s brassy barmaid Bet Lynch (pictured right), Julie Goodyear’s departure in 1995 was big news, though she revisited the role several times. She later appeared in Hollyoaks as Mrs Temple — a brassy B&B owner (left) For 15 years, Gillian Taylforth was Kathy Beale in EastEnders (pictured right with Steve McFadden) before quitting in 2000. In 2013, Gillian joined Hollyoaks as Sandy Roscoe (left), mum to six ne’er-do-well, murdering sons. She left this year . In 1993, Sherrie Hewson became Maureen Naylor, the scatty shop assistant in Corrie — axed four years later, only to return in 2006 (pictured right). In 2001, she was Virginia Raven, a receptionist in the revival of Crossroads (centre).

"Police are hunting for Huw Norfolk, 27, an anarchist known as Badger, who they want to question over an arson attack on a phone mast and vandalism on newspaper offices . A middle-class anarchist suspected of causing criminal damage worth around £300,000 has had a £10,000 bounty placed on his head. Huw Norfolk, the son of a poet and a nuclear energy adviser, has been on the run for three years. Known as Badger, the heavily tattooed 27-year-old has links to anarchist communities across southern England, Europe and South America. Unable to track him down, police have taken the ‘quite unique’ step for a crime of this nature by offering a financial reward of £10,000 for information as to his whereabouts. Meanwhile, his parents have been left to deal with the humiliation of a manhunt for their son and have been questioned by police at the £700,000 family home in Cheltenham. His father, Dr David Norfolk, 64, is a Cambridge-educated company director who specialises in nuclear energy. His company, Norfolk Garrett Consultancy, advises nuclear operators on environmental regulations. His mother, Gill Garrett, 65, is a poet, writer and former lecturer. The couple have told Avon and Somerset Police they have ‘no clue as to his whereabouts’ and have had no contact with their son for some time. The Norfolks also have a 29-year-old daughter who is a volunteer officer in the health and social care sector and an accomplished archer. She attended Pate’s Grammar School in Cheltenham, one of the UK’s leading state schools. Their son is suspected of setting fire to a communications mast in Bath which caused about £300,000 worth of damage and knocked out the power to thousands of homes. He is also accused of causing criminal damage to the Bristol Post newspaper office during the August 2011 riots. Officers are investigating more than 100 incidents that have resulted in a combined £20million worth of damage and say they cannot rule out his links to these other attacks. Police first appealed locally for information on Norfolk’s whereabouts in 2011 but it yielded no results. His last known address was in Bristol city centre but police said he had could have fled the country by now. A letter attributed to him and posted online in November 2011 said: ‘My decision is not to comply with my judicial persecution.’ With little to go on officers decided to put the £10,000 bounty on his head. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Bevan, who is leading the investigation, said: ‘Norfolk is wanted in connection with these two serious crimes and we’re asking the public to help us to find him. The arson attack at Bathampton mast on January 3, 2013, caused damage worth several hundred thousand pounds and affected TV, radio and mobile phone signals to thousands of homes and businesses, including sole and small-scale traders and independent businesses that rely on their telephones to work and trade. Police from the Avon and Somerset force (pictured) believe Norfolk has connections to anarchist groups responsible for 60 fires around Bath, and other groups in Pembrokshire, Bristol, and London . ‘It robbed many people of their only lifeline in the event of an emergency and put the lives of thousands of innocent adults and children at risk.’ He said the incident at the Bristol Post building, which saw windows smashed and paint thrown at it, caused thousands of pounds worth of ‘mindless criminal damage’. ‘Both incidents caused huge disruption to the lives of innocent people and we’re taking them extremely seriously,’ DCI Bevan added. Norfolk is white, of a slight build and around 5ft 9in. He has green eyes and sometimes wears spectacles. The anarchist is known to regularly change his appearance and give false details, including the name of Geoffrey or Howard.

"Taxpayers paid more than £3,000 for every badger killed in last year’s cull. Official figures revealed the final cost to the public purse of the cull was £6.3 million - with some 1,879 badgers killed. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural affairs revealed the figures last night. Official figures reveal the final cost to the public of the cull was £6.3 million - with 1,879 badgers killed . The Government could have faced estimated costs of £100 million a year if the cull, designed to protect farms from the spread of tuberculosis among cattle, had not taken place. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the price of the cull was due to rigorous safety rules and the humane methods used by its marksmen. Overall, the programme was said to have cost £6,294,000 to kill 955 badgers in Somerset and 924 in Gloucestershire – meaning it cost around £3,350 per badger. Around £2.6 million was spent monitoring ‘humaneness’ and £2.3 million on ‘efficiency’. Brian May, the Queen guitarist,  joined a rally against the badger cull when it was first proposed in 2012 -  the Badger Trust lost its Court of Appeal challenge to government proposals to kill wild badgers in England . A test cull began last year in the West of England, and was later extended when marksmen missed their targets. The Government has already approved a second cull for this year. However, Labour told the Daily Telegraph that last year’s attempt to reduce the spread of TB had come at a ‘huge cost to the taxpayer’ with little effect. A Defra spokesman said: 'England has the highest incidence of bovine TB in Europe. The cost of the badger culls need to be seen in the context of the devastating scale of the threat bovine TB poses to our farming industry and food security - £500million over the last decade. Doing nothing is not an option. 'We are pursuing a comprehensive strategy, including tighter cattle movement controls, badger vaccination and culling. 'Many of the costs associated with the pilot culls last year were one-offs and have not been repeated this year.'","Official DEFRA figures revealed 1,879 badgers were killed in the cull .

"A 'feisty' giant rhea burst past its owner and went running down a busy main road causing bemusement, just six weeks after another of a massive birds escaped. Locals in Warminster Town, Wiltshire, took photographs of the bird as it fled having avoided the attempts of several women who tried to keep it under control. Police spent three hours chasing the flightless bird before it was cornered allowing the owner to safely collect it. The giant rhea, pictured, escaped from its owner yesterday evening and ran down the street in Warminster . Local resident Andy Taylor spotted the rhea, pictured, running past his car as he was stuck in rush-hour traffic yesterday afternoon . Police officers spent three hours trying to capture massive bird after it escaped yesterday afternoon bringing traffic in Warminster to a standstill . Eyewitness Adam Taylor, 29 said: 'To be honest I didn't see it at first. I was wondering why the car in front had suddenly stopped. 'Then I saw what I thought was an albino ostrich and a women trying to shepherd it back towards her house. 'I thought, ""well that's something you don't see everyday"". 'The owner managed to grab it but it shed a few feathers escaping her grasp, and then ran off stopped and turned by my car. 'I thought about getting out and helping but wasn't sure how safe a choice that was, as I was unsure if it was dangerous or not. 'I've seen ostriches before at Longleat and assumed this was the same.' The . bird's owner, who did not want give his name, said: 'It's a male bird . and unfortunately he has taken a dislike to me so when I went to get the . post yesterday afternoon he just burst at me. 'He made a dash for it through the open gate and that was it. Unfortunately this time of year males can be really feisty and that's what happened. 'It . wouldn't ever hurt anyone else, they are lovely creatures, my . 10-year-old can play with them just fine, it's just me he doesn't like. He made a run for it down the road and we had to wait for the police to corner it and bring it back.' He added: . 'I used to own lots of Rhea, I had them on my farm, they are lovely . birds. I'm in the process of selling off the house so I'm selling off . the birds too, this was my last one. 'They are a South American bird and they keep them rather than sheep, they really are lovely.' Police officers spent three hours chasing the bird. An earlier escaped rhea in Hertfordshire, pictured, was shot dead and turned into sausages . Baffled residents could not believe their eyes when they spotted an exotic bird - running riot in a quiet town centre. Police . called nearby Longleat Safari Park thinking that the Rhea may have . escaped from the estate, but they said all animals were accounted for. Rita the Rhea, escaped from a small holding owned by Jo Clark in Starling's Green in Essex in mid-March. The giant bird was running wild for more than a month when it was eventually shot in the head by gamekeeper Stuart Howe. Mr Howe said he saw the bird 70 yards away in a rape seed field near Royston, Hertfordshire. After shooting Rita, Mr Howe said he was going to turn her into gourmet sausages. The giant white flightless bird was eventually cornered in a back garden in Warminster, where its owner came to pick it up. Sergeant Jim Suter, Sector Sergeant for Trowbridge and Bradford-on-Avon, informed followers of the strange chase on Twitter. 'Police responding to report of Ostrich running through #Warminster High Street,' he tweeted. 'The Ostrich turned out to be a Rea located rear of #Warminster hospital and returned to owner.'

"The quest for a device that will allow humans to soar like birds has led to some strange contraptions over the years.

Users will even smell whatever landscape they’re flying over. ‘Soundwise you perceive only the roaring of the wind and the flaps of the wings,’ the designers write on their website. ‘The olfactoric feedback is based on the location which the bird flies over in the scenery and ranges from the scent of a forest, soil, to several other odours of the wilderness.’ The designers claim that Birdly still needs some changes to avoid making the user feel sick. However, the machine is primarily an art installation and there are no plans to commercialise it. The device is the latest in a range of concepts designed to make use of the ultra-realistic Oculus Rift headset. Don't look down: An Oculus Rift VR headset provides a stomach=churning bird-eye-view of the flight . For instance, the Norwegian Army is trialling a system that uses the Oculus Rift headset to drive armoured vehicles without soldiers having to stick their heads above the hatch. Cameras mounted around the vehicle film its surroundings and this footage is fed to the driver through the headset, creating the illusion that the tank is ‘transparent.

The experiment is called 'Living with lag' and sees four volunteers going through activities while using an Oculus Rift together with a Rasperry Pi, webcam and noise-cancelling headphones. Together, this combination can simulate different levels of lag, from a brief 0.33 seconds to a more frustrating three seconds. The results are rather hilariously shown in their video, which includes the volunteers struggling to dance and play table tennis.","Motor translates movements from simulator into flapping of virtual wings .

"A Houston mother has been charged with neglect after her nine-year-old daughter's body was discovered stuffed inside a refrigerator six months ago. Amber Keyes is being held Wednesday on a charge of injury to a child-serious bodily injury. The 35-year-old Keyes hasn't been charged with killing her daughter, Ayahna Comb, but Houston police say the neglect charge is linked to her death. Ayahna weighed 14 pounds when some children looking for food found her body in Keyes' refrigerator in June. Charged: Houston mom Amber Keyes, 33 (left), has been charged over the death of her nine-year-old daughter Ayahna (right), whose body was found in the crisper of a fridge in June weighing just 14 pounds . Tragic: The body of Ayahna (center) was found wrapped in a blanket inside the fridge of mother Amber Keyes' (right) apartment. Ayahna, who has a younger sister (left), had been there almost five months, it's believed . A neighbor called police to the Happy Home apartments in the 10100 block of Club Creek. At the time paramedics determined the little girl had been dead at least a month. An autopsy determined Ayahna, who had cerebral palsy, died of malnutrition and dehydration. Keyes says she found Ayahna unresponsive on January 29 but couldn't revive her, so she wrapped the girl in a blanket and stashed her in the fridge. If the account is accurate, the child would have been in the fridge for over four months. Ayahna could not talk, was confined to a wheelchair and had to be bottle-fed. An attorney for Keyes didn't immediately comment. Bond was set at $50,000. Scene: The dead girl was found in the refrigerator of a home at The Happy Home Apartments (pictured) in Houston, Texas in June. Investigators believe that she had been there for five months . Neglect: Amber Keyes - seen here in an earlier picture - is being held in the Harris County Jail on $50,000 bond . Keyes also has a criminal record. She was arrested for possession of a controlled substance in 1998 and spent over 12 months in prison as a result. She then spent 30 days in jail for a criminal trespass charge in 2000. Keyes previously lost custody of another child more than a decade ago. USA Today reported that Child Protective Services removed an 18-month-old that suffered physical abuse in 2002. The child was placed in foster care. Keyes went on to have another two other children, both daughters, one of which was Ayahna. The father of the two older girls, Armand Comb, broke down in tears after learning of Ayahna's death earlier this year. Comb said he last saw his daughter about two months before her body was discovered and that she appeared to be in good health. Tears: The girl's father Armand Comb said that he had no idea his daughter was dead and claimed to have seen her two months before her body was found in June . 'Last time I saw her, she was looking good. It looked like she was gaining weight. Her cheeks were kind of fat. I would never, never suspect that,' he told KHOU in June. Comb said he spoke to his ex-girlfriend on  the day his daughter was discovered and that Keyes 'was talking like she was there with them'. 'I just want to know what happened man, why? I was right here I would've helped. I would've done anything.'","The body of Ayahna Comb, 9, was found wrapped in a blanket inside the crisper of the fridge in her mother's Houston apartment in June .

"New figures reveal 22.5 per cent of children are obese or overweight, with the highest rates found in Hackney, east London (picture posed by model) One in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or five, figures show. This rises to one in five by the final year of primary school when they are ten or 11. But rates vary across England and are generally much higher in the most deprived areas. Hackney in East London, for example, has the highest level of obesity, with 14.4 per cent of reception age children – one in seven – and 26.1 per cent of those in Year 6 affected. The Government had been hoping rates were starting to stabilise or fall, but this year they are back up. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that 22.5 per cent of reception age children are obese or overweight, up from 22.2 per cent last year. For children in Year 6, aged ten or 11, the rate is 33.5 per cent, compared with 33.3 per cent last year. With the figures released a week earlier than usual, campaigners accused the Government of trying to bury bad news on the day of the Autumn Statement. The HSCIC denied this, saying the data had been ready sooner and pointing out that the Department of Health had no influence on the publication date. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘It’s very sad – we’re just letting our children get fatter and fatter. ‘It’s going to be another full year before we have any kind of strategy from the Government. ‘It’s tragic. The Government are trying to bury bad news.’ Dr Colin Michie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ‘What is startling is the gulf between health outcomes for rich and poor, the fact that childhood obesity is continuing to rise and children are getting fatter younger.’ Eustace de Sousa, of Public Health England, said: ‘It is deeply concerning that there is an actual doubling of child obesity rates from reception to the end of primary school, and that children from low-income households are significantly more likely to be overweight or obese.’ Obesity levels in children had remained stable over the past few years and last year they appeared to be falling. This year’s rise has prompted concern that government strategies are not working. These include the ‘Responsibility Deal’, under which food and drinks manufacturers set their own targets for cutting sugar and fat, and the Change4Life campaign. The figures are based on data from 1.1million children who took part in the National Child Measurement Programme. The lowest levels of obesity are in Windsor and Maidenhead, Berkshire, affecting just 5.5 per cent of reception children and 16.2 per cent of those in Year 6. Public health minister Jane Ellison said: ‘Childhood obesity rates have remained stable since 2010 but, as these new statistics show, we know there is more to be done. The whole nation needs to understand the problems obesity can cause.’ Three times as many children have tried e-cigarettes as have smoked tobacco, figures show. A study of 1,601 pupils aged ten and 11 in Wales found that 6 per cent had sampled the devices compared to 2 per cent who had smoked cigarettes. A study of more than 1,000 children found six per cent had tried e-cigarettes compared with two per cent who had smoked cigarettes. Furthermore those who tried the devices said they were more likely to smoke tobacco prompting experts to warn they are 'luring' children to smoking . Those who had tried e-cigs were seven times more likely to take up smoking within the next two years. The findings have added to fears that e-cigs are luring children to more harmful tobacco. Campaigners called for a ‘watchful eye’ on their use. Some 14 per cent of those who’d tried e-cigs said they might start compared to just two per cent of children who’d never tried. The battery-operated devices resemble pens or cigarettes and they contain a liquid form of nicotine that give users the same rush as smoking. Mark Drakeford, health minister for Wales said: ‘These latest findings shine further light on the potential impact of e-cigarettes on our children and young people. ‘I am concerned the use of e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to and re-normalise smoking, especially for a generation who have grown up in a largely smoke-free society.'","Rates across England vary but Hackney in east London has highest level .

"The mourning widow of Eric Garner spoke out Wednesday night following a grand jury's decision not to indict Daniel Pantaleo for killing her husband with a chokehold and said she does not accept the officer's apology. 'Hell no,' Esaw Garner, 46, told a reporter who asked her if she accepted the 29-year-old cop's condolences. 'The time for remorse was when my husband was yelling to breathe…when he was screaming 11 times that he can’t breathe.' The widow's angry reaction came out at the tail end of a press conference held for her and Garner's mother Gwen Carr alongside Reverend Al Sharpton. 'H*** no I don't accept his apologies': The mourning widow of Eric Garner spoke out Wednesday night following a grand jury's decision not to indict Daniel Pantaleo for killing her husband with a chokehold and said she does not accept the officer's apology . Emotional night: Esaw Garner, widow of Eric Garner (left) cries as activist Reverend Al Sharpton speaks at a news conference at the National Action Network in the Harlem. At right, Garner's grieving daughter Emerald wipes away a tear at the event . Rev. Al Sharpton (left) President of the National Action Network, Gwen Carr (center), mother of Eric Garner, and Esaw Garner (right), his widow gave at times tearful, and at others angry, comments during a press conference held after a New York grand jury failed to indict the cop who killed Garner over the summer . 'He’s still working, he’s still collecting a paycheck, feeding his kids,' Garner said of Pantaleo as Sharpton told reporters that would be the first and only question of the evening. Pantaleo said in an earlier statement, 'It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner...I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss.' Pantaleo had been stripped of his gun and badge and will remain on desk duty pending an internal police investigation that could result in administrative charges. Garner continued: . 'My husband is now six feet under and I’m, looking for a way to feed my kids,' she said as she asked the question, who's gonna play Santa Claus for their kids this year? It was an emotional punctuation to an otherwise straightforward press event. Al Sharpton introduced Garner and her mother-in-law after calling for peaceful protests and condemning looters who've taken advantage of the situation in Ferguson. Reverend Al Sharpton addresses reporters at the press event. The decision in Eric Garner's case has further fueled flames of unrest in communities who feel police racial bias is a rampant problem in America, where they say the legal system is tipped in police favor . Garner's mother Gwen Carr addresses reporters and expressed her shock over the decision. 'I don’t know what video they were looking at,' she said. 'It wasn’t the same one the rest of the world was looking at' 'There are some that take advantage of protests, they are not the protesters' he said, before clarifying his and his allies' stance on police. 'We are not against all police, but those who break the law should pay and be held accountable.' Garner spoke after Sharpton and assured her supporters, many of them as furious as she over the grand jury's decision, that the fight would go on. 'This fight ain’t over, its just begun,' she said, before emotions took over. 'He should be here celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas with his children...He’s not here because a cop did wrong. 'As long as I have a breath in my body,' she said, 'I will fight.' Garner's bereaved mother then addressed the reporters and expressed her extreme disappointment with the decision. 'I don’t know what video they were looking at,' she said. 'It wasn’t the same one the rest of the world was looking at.' Like Sharpton, Carr ended her comments with a call for peace in all the protests nationwide. 'No Christmas': Garner, a father of six, won't be around to play Santa for them this year, a thought that had his wife in tears at Wednesday's press event .

"After being selected by the St. Louis Rams in the 2014 NFL Draft, then waived from their practice squad, Michael Sam's professional football future seemed somewhat bleak. That all changed in September however when the Dallas Cowboys added him to their practice squad, though they too waived him in late October making him a free agent. Now, Sam is wondering why he keeps getting cut because he says he has the talent to play professional football. Scroll down for video . Cut: Michael Sam (above) the first openly gay NFL player, was recently asked about being cut from the St. Louis Rams and Dallas Cowboys and why he was not on any NFL team's roster . So in love: Sam has been very public about his relationship with boyfriend Vito Cammisano . When asked by TMZ why he thought he was not on the roster of an NFL team, Sam said; 'I think I was the SEC Defensive Player of the Year last year ... so I don't think it had to do with talent.' And while they took that to mean Sam was saying he was cut because he was gay, he quickly clarified his statement on Twitter. 'Despite what headlines you may read, I’ve never said and have never believed that I am being kept out of the league,' wrote Sam. 'I know I have talent to play in the NFL and I look forward to getting an opportunity once again to prove that I can help a team win.' Clearing the air: Sam later clarified his statement to TMZ on Twitter . Reaffirming: He repeated that he knew he had the talent, but has never believed his sexuality is why he was cut or not playing . Superstar: Sam was named one of GQ's Men of the Year . Football or not, Sam's career has been taking off since he graduated from University of Missouri, with the  24-year-old becoming perhaps the most famous openly gay professional athlete, becoming so big he even graced the cover of GQ as they named him one of their Men of the Year. And if the NFL doesn't work out he does have a big fan in Mötley Crüe front man Vince Neil, who has been very vocal about wanting him for he new Las Vegas Arena Football League team.","Michael Sam, the first openly gay player in the NFL, was dropped from the St. Louis Rams and the Dallas Cowboys this season .

"Leaping from high cliffs into dangerous, crocodile-infested waters - these are the moments a herd of gnus put their lives at risk as they migrate in search of food. Many of the animals, also known as wildebeest, do not make it out alive as they take the treacherous leap of faith down the sheer ridge . The stunning shots were taken in the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya  by French photography duo Laurent Renaud and Dominique Haution. Leap of faith: The gnus jump from the high, sheer cliff face into crocodile-infested waters as they migrate in search of food and drinking water . Treacherous times: One gnu plunges head-first into the muddy river (left) while another slips and gets stuck down a crack in the cliff (right) All creatures great and small: A herd of zebras joins the gnus, also known as wildebeest, as they make a slightly easier crossing through a river . Sure-footed: The gnus have to be extremely careful as they descend the steep cliff face that they do not land badly and kill or injure themselves . I believe I can fly: A brave gnu soars from the edge of the rocks and into the water below, before trying to swim across to safety . Pack mentality: The gnus travel in herds, as this makes it easier from them to overcome obstacles together and to protect the young and weak . 'The gnus need to make the dangerous trip down the cliff and across the river, so they don't run out of food when the winter months come,' Mr Renaud said. 'The gnus throw themselves off the ridge and some get stuck into the ridges of the cliffs, which is jaw-dropping to watch.' The animals' migration starts at the end of the East African rainy season, as they go off in search of drinking water and food, and they come back months later when the rain also returns. Stunning: The incredible photographs were captured by French duo Laurent Renaud and Dominique Haution in the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya . What goes down must come up: The herd of gnus make their way up the bank after crossing the river (left) while one makes a huge leap down the cliff (right) Making a splash: One of the migrating beats has a very sloppy landing as it slips from the cliff face and falls backwards into the river . Far more graceful: Another gnu looks far more comfortable as it leaps elegantly into the waters below to join its companions . You're next: A group of gnus, including some young, stand at the edge of the cliff and wait their turns to undertake the terrifying ordeal . To tackle the obstacles that are presented to them, they travel in large herds, learning from and protecting each other. They protect the smaller, weaker members of the group from predators by keeping them in the middle of the herd, and having the strongest animals on the outsides. Mr Renaud and Ms Haution have been taking pictures together for over 20 years and they come to the Kenyan reserve every year to try and capture the incredible shots. Ms Haution said: 'We know when the gnus are going to migrate so we set our cameras up and just wait to see what happens. 'It is always so exciting and an incredible experience. I can't wait to go back and watch it next year.'","Gnus, also known as wildebeest, are migratory, and have to cross treacherous river to find food and drinking water .

"Given that this thing is the height of a man, can disembowel a human with one thwack of its three-pronged claw and weighs up to 90lb, the locals seem remarkably relaxed that it is on the loose. In fact, as the hunt for the runaway rhea of Essex gathers momentum, they all seem to be treating the whole thing as a bit of a laugh. And last night, the jokes took a turn for the worse. Because the Daily Mail has now tracked down this giant flightless bird – a 45mph ostrich-cum-emu usually found on South American pampas – to a golf course outside Nuthampstead, Hertfordshire. Scroll down for video . Latest sighting: Charmaine Lake captured this image of the missing rhea bird which can run at speeds of up to 40mph at Barkway Park Golf Club, near Nuthampstead, Hertfordshire . Tracked down: Despite the missing rhea bird being capable of killing a man with a single whack of its claw, locals at the Barkway Park Golf Club, near Nuthampstead, pictured, don't seem concerned . And by close of play yesterday evening, the ‘birdie’ gags were becoming unbearable in the 19th hole at Barkway Park Golf Club. Mind you, they might not be chortling quite so happily the next time they’re poking around in the rough for a missing ball … . For even if we have now narrowed down the chase, no one seems to think there is much chance of trapping this monster feather duster in the near future. It is nearly four weeks since the six-year-old female rhea went on the run from Jo Clark’s smallholding in Brent Pelham on the Essex/Hertfordshire border. Jo has kept rheas for many years – among her horses, sheep, geese, ducks and cats – in order to keep down the weeds on her 11 acres. No one is entirely sure why the bird escaped, although Jo thinks it may have been spooked by the local hunt passing nearby. ‘I followed her for four hours with a bucket of food, but you can’t herd these creatures and so I gave up,’ says Jo, who still has three remaining rheas, all one-year-old offspring of the runaway mum. Since rheas are not remotely maternal (after laying their eggs, they leave the hatching and childcare to the males), it is unlikely that this one will be feeling any pangs of remorse. Certainly, as I drop in on the abandoned trio, they all seem perfectly happy. In recent days, however, there have been sporadic sightings of Mum across a five-mile radius hereabouts. Spotted: A cyclist took this picture of the fugitive South American rhea - which stands at around six-foot tall - in countryside north east of Stevenage in Hertfordshire at the weekend . On the hunt: The Daily Mail's Robert Hardman goes in search of the missing rhea bird in the rape seed fields of Astey, Hertfordshire . On Sunday, civil engineer Tim Bradshaw managed to take a charming shot of the animal in a field of rapeseed just outside the village of Anstey. Since then, a media circus has descended, armed with lurid warnings about the  damage these birds can inflict when cornered. As I rapidly discover, though, we’re not exactly talking Beast of Bodmin, let alone Jaws. ‘We’re all looking out for it now,’ says Tim’s wife, Madeleine, a piano teacher. ‘It’s funny because my husband’s always been a keen photographer and so has his father. ‘His dad once had a picture published in the Bath Chronicle. Now, Tim’s gone one better with a picture in the national papers and we’ve even had Have I Got News For You on the phone!’ Son Harry, ten, is determined to go one better and has been out trying to capture some video footage. Is he a little scared? After all, the RSPCA and the cops are warning people not to approach the bird, even though Jo Clark’s young brood wouldn’t say boo to one of her geese. He said: 'You can see the bird . standing in a couple of the shots, in the others it was grubbing around . in the rape field for food, or perhaps it was trying to bury its head in . the sand. 'It was about six feet high with its head up.' Big bird: The runaway rhea was also photographed near Brent Pelham on Thursday by cyclist Ray Murdoch . Mr Murdoch took these two pictures with his mobile phone after the bird trotted off into a field of rape seed oil . ‘I’m not worried,’ says Harry. ‘It’s good fun.’ The locals have already named the bird Chris – after the singer, Chris Rea – despite the fact that this rhea is a she. There is no great desire to see her returned to captivity. In fact, everyone seems to wish ‘Chris’ the best of luck. ‘I hope people just leave it alone. It’ll be fine out there and there’s plenty for it to eat,’ says Di Pyper. As the joint master of the local hunt, the Puckeridge, Di knows this terrain better than anyone and agrees to be my guide. She first learned of the creature from her sister-in-law. ‘She’d just fallen off her horse and came home talking about seeing an ostrich. We all thought she must have concussion and told her to lie down. Then other people started saying the same.’ Today, she has heard reports of sightings five miles away, near the 12th fairway at Barkway Park Golf Club, and off we go. It’s charming countryside, narrow lanes meandering through gently undulating crop-filled fields sprinkled with thatched cottages and handsome little churches. We’re only 35 miles from London and a short drive from Stansted Airport, but it’s a tranquil spot  with plenty of hedgerows and woods to provide cover for a furtive feathered giant. Barkway Park is a delightful little . club. At the clubhouse, Anthony Smith has just finished a round. Has he . seen a grey/brown South American bird, about 5ft 8in tall? ‘So that’s . what it was,’ he says. ‘I did catch a glimpse of something running . across the 11th fairway.’ Really hard to spot: The six-foot bird has been on the run for a month. They are also incredibly hard to catch because of their fast speeds . Disappeared: The rhea escaped from a smallholding in Brent Pelham on the Essex/Hertfordshire border . The hunt closes in. I meet greenkeeper Carl Edwards. He and his colleague, Anthony Lake, have not just seen the bird a few hours earlier, they have managed to capture it on their mobile phones. ‘Anthony just said: “There’s that emu!”. It was about my height and minding its own business so we started filming,’ says Carl, showing me the result. Sure enough, there is ‘Chris’, snooping around the western edge of the course. She certainly doesn’t seem to pose a threat and just ambles off into the bushes when the two men get too close. Later on, Anthony’s wife, Charmaine, says that she spotted the bird while out with her two young children and grabbed a snap of it on her phone. It is dashing across a nicely manicured fairway as purposefully as a club captain who has just spotted a non-member wearing inappropriate trousers and teeing off in the wrong direction. ‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw it,’ she says, ‘but I’m not sure I’d want to get too close to it.’ By last night, word of our progress had spread and the media circus had started to descend on the fairways of Barkway Park. So why should a wild South American bird take a fancy to golf? Jo Clark has another theory: ‘A few years ago, I did sell a breeding pair to a man near Barkway, and this one will be looking for a mate at this time of year.’ In which case, it may not be too long before this bit of East Anglia starts to see rather more exotic flightless birds running wild and causing mayhem. I fear I can see an Essex girl joke coming already … .","Rhea escaped from home in Brent Pelham, Hertfordshire, four weeks ago .

"Shanesha Taylor, 35, denied using $114,000 in donations  to buy designer clothes and finance her boyfriend's rap album . A mother who left her young sons in a hot car while she went for a job interview has denied squandering $114,000 in donations received after the story attracted public sympathy. Shanesha Taylor, 35, from Phoenix, Arizona, who is still unemployed, said she has not used the money to finance her boyfriend's rap album and buy designer clothes. The mother-of-three insisted she could not afford to put any of the money into a trust fund for her children, saying the idea was 'not realistic'. 'I am here to make sure their needs are provided for,' said Ms Taylor. 'But will I set aside a large amount of money for 16, 18 years that we need to get by today? That's not realistic.' Her trial on child abuse charges had been expected to start Wednesday, as she had previously pleaded not guilty, but a judge rescheduled it for February. Ms Taylor became an Internet sensation after her tear-stained mugshot was published following her arrest for leaving her two-year-old and six-month-old in a 100F car. She received $114,000 in donations, but missed the deadline to set aside the $60,000 for her children's trust fund, a sum which was initially agreed with prosecutors. 'Any money spent has gone to housing, clothes, car payments as well as fast-food outings and birthday parties,' said Ms Taylor. 'I'm not the type of person to go out and finance someone's rap album. 'Yes, I threw them birthday parties because they haven't had birthday parties in years,' she said. 'I took care of Thanksgiving dinner because my mother couldn't afford to take care of that.' Ms Taylor was arrested on March 20 after leaving her two young sons in her car for about 45 minutes while she interviewed for a job with a Scottsdale insurance company. Scroll down for video . Ms Taylor left her two sons - one two years old and the other six months - in her car for about 45 minutes outside an insurance company where she was being interviewed for a job . Police said the keys were in the ignition but the air conditioning was off and the fan was blowing hot air . A witness found the six-month-old crying hysterically and sweating profusely as temperatures inside the SUV exceeded 100F. Her children were taken to hospital on the day of her arrest but were not found to have suffered any injuries. They were placed with family and Taylor was eventually allowed to see them under supervision. She struck a deal with prosecutors in July that allowed her to avoid prosecution if she fulfilled a number of requirements, such as setting up the trust funds, taking parenting classes and completing a substance-abuse treatment program. A struggling New Jersey mother set up a youcaring page for Ms Taylor which raised  more than $100,000 .

"Most trips on the M25 involve lorries, traffic jams and a case of high blood pressure. But motorists were left stunned when they spotted something a little different - a giraffe travelling along the middle lane of the motorway. The head of the animal could be seen poking above the tailgate of a trailer yesterday afternoon. Scroll down for video . The giraffe was spotted on the M25 in Kent, being driven in a foreign-registered vehicle . The giraffe, called Valentino, was spotted on the M25 being transferred from Paignton zoo in Devon to a new home in Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Kent . Teacher Mark Marsh, 44, took a picture of the giraffe as it was being transferred from Paignton zoo in Devon to a new home in Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Kent. Mr Marsh said the unusual sight of the giraffe, near Redhill in Surrey had 'brightened up' his journey. The foreign-registered vehicle was spotted carrying one of Africa's more exotic exports on the M25 in Kent. Paignton Zoo said it was a Rothschild's giraffe called Valentino, who had been born on Valentine's Day in 2012. The giraffe had to be hand reared by keepers following rejection by his mother. Paignton Zoo said it was a Rothschild's giraffe called Valentino, who had been born on Valentine's Day in 2012 . Port Lympne said his arrival signals the start of the reserve's breeding programme with these endangered animals. Animal director Adrian Harland said: 'We are delighted to welcome this lovely male giraffe to the reserve and to be accepted as part of this breeding programme. 'There are so few Rothschild giraffes in the wild that programmes like this one are essential.' Port Lympne has become part of a worldwide breeding programme designed to save the endangered species. It is estimated that fewer than 700 individuals remain in the wild. Paul Beer, head of the giraffe section, said: 'The arrival of Valentino is fantastic news. He's a good looking, healthy male and I'm hoping that the girls take a shine to him.' Visitors to the reserve will be able to see Valentino exploring his new surroundings on The African Experience - 100 acres of land, alive with African animals including black rhino, zebra, wildebeest and ostrich.

"China has become the world’s largest source of international tourists – but it appears they are leaving London off their itineraries. New research from CityMetric Intelligence suggests that Chinese tourists are skipping the UK capital – one of the most popular destinations in the world – in favour of places such as New York, which has six times as many visitors, Los Angeles and Moscow, the most popular destination in Europe. That means London is missing out on a massive amount of business as the market for Chinese holidaymakers was worth an estimated $129bn (approximately £82bn) in 2013 – accounting for 11 per cent of the global tourism industry, according to the study. London had just 94,162 visitors from China in 2013 - ranking 22nd out of all long-haul destinations . Selfie: When factoring in Seoul and other cities that are closer to China, London ranked 33rd . It is estimated that the market could be worth $310bn (approximately £200bn) in 2018. In terms of long-haul destinations, London ranked a distant 22nd with just 94,162 visitors from China in 2013 – well behind New York, which topped the list with 646,000, even though it requires a longer flight. The second most popular long-haul destination was Los Angeles with 570,000 visitors, followed by Sydney (387,000), Moscow (376,500) and Melbourne (303,000) London also found itself behind Dubai (275,675), Venice (242,059) and Paris (226,068). The market for Chinese holidaymakers was worth an estimated $129bn (approximately £82bn) in 2013 . Overall, Seoul had the most visitors in China in 2013 at more than four million . When factoring in cities that are closer to home for Chinese holidaymakers, London ranked 33rd on the list, which was topped by Seoul with more than four million visitors from China. Bangkok was second with more than three million, followed by Singapore with more than two million. The CityMetric Intelligence report suggests that Chinese tourists are skipping London because it is more difficult to obtain a visa for the UK than neighbouring countries, and due to the fact that the UK is not a member of the Schengen zone that allows for free travel within Europe under one visa. But it says there are signs that the numbers have improved in 2014 and the UK government is taking steps to lure Chinese tourists amid calls for the visa regime to be simplified. New York was most popular long-haul destination with 646,000 visitors from China last year . Love for Russia: Moscow was the most popular European destination for Chinese tourists in 2013 . It has made it easier for them to obtain visas and in September announced plans to refund the cost of 25,000 visas for Chinese tourists visiting the UK in organised tour groups. This is in addition to an increased marketing push in the world’s most populous country. Robin Johnson, the director of the China Project at Visit Britain, told CityMetric: ‘We’ve stepped up our activity considerably in China over the past 18 months to further increase visits, not only to London, but crucially across the whole of Britain.’ He said the average Chinese visitor spends more than time and more money in Britain than in other European countries, and is more likely to travel outside the capital to other destinations in the UK.","NYC is most popular long-haul destination with 646,000 visitors from China .

"After years being subjected to torture inside the notorious Guantanamo Bay prison, Adelaide man David Hicks wants someone to pay for his medical bills, after a US military court set aside his terrorism conviction. With his name now legally cleared, Hicks doesn't care for an apology from the federal government, insisting he is too worn out and defeated but he does want help covering medical bills following years of torture inside the notorious military jail. A ruling by a US military court vacated his terrorism conviction and may have brought to an end to an almost decade-long legal saga but he received short shrift from current PM Tony Abbott and former leader John Howard. Scroll down for video . 'Defeated, worn out and no longer angry' but David Hicks wants his medical costs paid after tortured time inside Guantanamo Bay . Hicks, 39, is relieved the ordeal is over, but says he's not angry. 'It is just unfortunate that because of politics, I was subjected to five-and-a-half years of physical and psychological torture that I will now live with always,' he said. 'No, there is not anger. I think I am too defeated to have anger. I am worn out.' He won't be seeking compensation at this point but wants help with medical expenses because his time locked up in the US military jail in Cuba has led to ongoing health problems. He needs operations on his left knee, right elbow and back. 'My teeth keep getting pulled because I couldn't brush them for five and a half years,' he added. 'It is becoming an expensive exercise to fix myself from torture.' He's issued a plea to Federal Government that 'it is an expensive exercise to fix myself from torture' Prime Minister Tony Abbott makes no apology to David Hicks, saying 'he was up to no good' Earlier his father, Terry, called on the federal government to apologise to his son, but Prime Minister Tony Abbott was unsympathetic. 'He was up to no good on his own admission,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Launceston. 'I'm not in the business of apologising for the actions that Australian governments take to protect our country.' Asked if Australia had done enough to help Mr Hicks, Mr Abbott said: 'We did what was needed.' Mr Hicks said he didn't care about an apology, he just wanted to live a normal life. 'It's all over with,' he said. But former PM John Howard says David Hicks is not owed an apology by any government. 'The US verdict is about the legal process in that country,' Mr Howard, who was prime minster when Hicks was sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2002, said on Thursday. 'Nothing alters the fact that by his own admission, Hicks trained with Al Qaeda, met Osama bin Laden on several occasions - describing him as a brother. He revelled in jihad. 'He is not owed an apology by any Australian government.' Australian Greens leader Christine Milne said Mr Howard was trying to evade scrutiny. '(Mr Howard) doesn't want the scrutiny of what he did when he was prime minister in failing to stand up to the Americans, to a wrong conviction and for the rights of an Australian citizen,' she said. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten thinks the government has questions to answer about Mr Hicks' treatment. 'There is no doubt on one hand David Hicks was probably foolish to get caught up in that Afghanistan conflict, but clearly there has been an injustice done to him,' he said. Hicks says he has knee, elbow, back and teeth problems as a result of his time inside the notorious military prison but claims he was on holiday when picked up in Afghanistan . In March 2007 Mr Hicks pleaded guilty while in Guantanamo to providing material support to terrorism. This was part of a plea bargain that allowed most of his seven-year sentence to be suspended and Mr Hicks to return to Australia. In 2014, a US appeal court ruled that providing material support to terrorism was not a legally viable war crime under the jurisdiction of the Guantanamo court. Prosecutors had argued his conviction should stand because he had agreed not to appeal as part of the plea deal. But this was rejected in a unanimous decision by the US Court of Military Commission Review. Hicks' story began about 15 years ago when he left Australia and later travelled to Pakistan and on to Afghanistan, where he joined an al-Qaeda training camp. He was handed to the US and taken in 2002 to the US Navy base and military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Asked on Thursday what he was doing in Afghanistan in 2001, Hicks replied: 'Having a holiday'. He also hit out at his critics. 'I think they're supporters of torture,' he said.","'Defeated, worn out and no longer angry' but Hicks wants his medical costs paid after tortured time inside Guantanamo Bay .

"The Swedish government has said it will be calling for new elections next year, just two months into office. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven made the announcement after parliament rejected the left-wing minority government's budget proposal in a vote today. The Social Democrat-Green Party coalition's budget was voted down after right-wing anti-immigration party Sweden Democrats decided to back the centre-right opposition. Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, second from right, surrounded by, from left, Minister of Education Gustav Fridolin and Deputy Prime Minister Asa Romson of the Green Party and Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson of the Social Democrats, announced that new elections will be held next year . The government will not officially announce the re-election until December 29, as the Swedish Constitution states that a government has to have been in power for at least three months before doing so. Speaking at an emergency press conference this afternoon, Lofven said he will call for new elections to be held on March 22 next year. 'I have taken responsibility, I will be taking the responsibility today,' Lofven said, adding that he blames his predecessors in government, the centre-right Alliance coalition led by Moderate Party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt, for the re-elections. 'They [The Alliance parties] are allowing the Sweden Democrats to dictate the terms of Swedish politics. 'These are irresponsible actions by five political parties that are unprecedented in Swedish history.' Attacked: The centre-right opposition, seen here (L-R) is Anna Kinberg Batra, who is a hot candidate to take over leadership of the Moderate Party,  Goran Hagglund (hidden), Christian Democrats; Annie Loof, Center Party and Jan Bjorklund, Liberals, were accused of letting the far-right 'dictate the terms of Swedish politics' 182 lawmakers voted against the budget in Parliament Wednesday, while only 153 voted in favor. The far-right Sweden Democrats emerged as power-brokers after the September election, after being voted the country's third biggest party with 13 per cent. Lofven became prime minister in October as head of a coalition with the Greens, promising to reverse many reforms by the previous center-right government. He accused the anti-immigrant party of wanting 'to knock out any government that doesn't dance to their tune.' From the start, Lofven's minority government — which has 138 seats in parliament — was expected to struggle to push its agenda through. With the support of the former Communist Left Party, which stands outside the Cabinet, it controls 159 seats. The center-right opposition, made up of four parties, has 141 seats, but the 49 extra votes expected from the Sweden Democrats would be enough to topple the ruling coalition.","Sweden to hold new elections in March next year, government announces .

"One of the largest organized polygamy groups in Utah said this week it is investigating an allegation that its leader molested one of his daughters, who is now featured on the TLC reality TV show 'My Five Wives.' Rosemary Williams  wrote in a blog posted last month that she was molested more than two decades ago by her father, Lynn A. Thompson. Ms Williams says her father fondled her when she was 12 years old. David Watson, a spokesman for the Apostolic United Brethren, or AUB, declined to answer questions about the investigation, referring repeatedly to a news release the group sent earlier this week. 'We're handling it internally,' Watson said. Speaking out: Rosemary Williams of TLC's My Five Wives wrote in a blog posted last month that she was molested more than two decades ago by her father, Lynn A. Thompson when she was 12-years-old . Investigation underway: . Rosemary Williams of My Five Wives on TLC says she was molested more than two decades ago by her father, Lynn A. Thompson (seated far left) In the news release, the group acknowledged the allegations but declined to address specifics. The group, which has an estimated 7,500 followers in Utah and across the West, said it already works with a domestic violence organization and trains it leaders to spot and report abuse. When contacted by The Associated Press last month, Thompson said the allegations were not true. He could not be reached Wednesday. State and local authorities in Utah are unaware of any formal complaints against Thompson. Her husband, Brady Williams, said on Wednesday he welcomed an investigation. However, he questioned how serious AUB leaders are given that no one has reached out yet to talk with his third wife. 'What kind of investigation is it really? Maybe they're getting their ducks in a row. Maybe it takes a little bit of time . . . but is their investigation just asking Lynn about this?' Brady Williams said. Speaking to who?: Husband Brady Williams claims that AUB hasn't even contacted his wife Rosemary Williams to ask her about the alleged assault when she was 12-years-old . The AUB is estimated to be the second-largest polygamist church in Utah, behind Warren Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints on the Utah-Arizona border. Unlike Jeffs' group, which has been plagued for years by allegations of abuse and child brides, the Apostolic United Brethren in northern Utah has a better reputation. Rosemary Williams told The Associated Press she did not plan to file a criminal accusation or a lawsuit against her father because she doesn't think it will do any good. She said she wanted to prevent him from abusing others, especially given his recent appointment as president of the AUB. In a second blog explaining why she came forward after so many years, she pushed back against the notion she did it for ratings for the TV show or to be in the spotlight. 'I love the family I was raised in - even with all its faults. I have been in agony over making this decision. But I made it because of my pressing conscience that it was the right thing to do,' Rosemary Williams wrote. TLC show: Rosemary Williams is one of the stars on the TLC show My Five Wives which talks about polygamy . 'My hope is that by telling my story, people will not put their total faith in a man who would do injury to others, physically, financially or emotionally.' The Williams live in a rural community outside of Salt Lake City where most people belong to the group Thompson leads. They are no longer members of the group after re-evaluating their core beliefs and withdrawing during the mid-2000s. The AUB said in its news release that it has been working to create an open dialogue with state officials because the attorney general's office stopped prosecuting plural families so long as other abuses weren't occurring. They say they are trying to foster a climate where plural families feel comfortable reporting abuses, but that it's not easy. 'The climate of secrecy and fear has been lifting, but this is a process that does not occur overnight,'the news release said.

"Under pressure from federal regulators, Honda is expanding a recall of potentially lethal driver's side airbags to all 50 U.S. states. The inflators, made by Japanese supplier Takata Corp., can explode with too much force under certain conditions, sending deadly metal shrapnel into the passenger compartment. The defect has has so far been linked to at least five deaths in the U.S. and many more injuries. Under pressure : Honda is expanding a recall of potentially lethal driver's side airbags to all 50 U.S. states . Hien Thi Tran, 51, of Orlando was among those fatally wounded. She died in October after a minor crash in her 2001 Honda Accord caused the airbag to deploy. Police believed she'd been the victim of a stabbing because of the severe nature of her injuries,  according to her family's lawsuit. But an autopsy revealed metal and plastic fragments from an exploding airbag caused her death. One incident from 2010 didn't involve a crash at all. Instead, a lawsuit claims that Kristy Williams was stopped at a red light in her 2001 Honda Civic when the airbag deployed. Victim: A lawsuit alleges that Hien Thi Tran, 51, of Orlando was struck by plastic and metal shrapnel after a Takata airbag deployed in her 2001 Honda Accord during a minor accident . Deadly: A metal component of the airbag that critically injured Tran is shown, as Takata deals with allegations that their airbags have caused numerous fatalities while the company covered up faulty parts . Metal fragments sliced into her neck, hitting her carotid artery, and Williams was only able to survive by placing two fingers into the wound to limit the bleeding. Afterwards, the lawsuit alleges, she suffered strokes and was left with traumatic brain injury. Takata insists that current Honda recalls covering 8 million U.S. cars in high-humidity areas - where moisture in the air can trigger an explosion - are sufficient. But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants the order expanded nationwide after some incidents outside the high-humidity zones. Ready to pop: The inflators, made by Japanese supplier Takata Corp., can explode with too much force under certain conditions, sending deadly metal shrapnel into the passenger compartment . Rick Schosteck, Honda's executive vice president for North America, told House lawmakers Wednesday that Honda will expand the regional recall it began in June, but will continue to prioritize high-humidity areas. These spots include Florida, Puerto Rico, areas near the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana, as well as Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands and Hawaii. Schosteck also said Honda is working with other air bag manufacturers to make sure it has enough parts. Q: How can I find out if my car has been recalled? A: Dozens of models made by BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Mazda, Honda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Toyota dating to the 2001 model year are covered. You should have received a recall notice from your automaker. Also, you can go to www.safercar.gov and key in your vehicle identification number, which normally is printed on your registration and stamped on the dashboard. That will tell you if your car is being recalled. You can also call your dealer. Honda is Takata's largest customer, and has so far recalled over 5 million vehicles in the U.S. alone . Q: Why are some of the recalls just in areas with high humidity? A: Government investigators and Takata officials believe that prolonged exposure to moisture in the air makes the inflator chemical, ammonium nitrate, burn too fast, creating too much pressure. That can cause the metal inflator canisters to shatter, spewing shrapnel into drivers and passengers. They're still conducting tests on inflators replaced by dealers to figure out what level of humidity causes the problem. Initially the recall areas were limited to Florida, Puerto Rico, areas near the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana, as well as Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands and Hawaii. Q: I live outside the recall areas, but the humidity is still high. Is my car safe? A: The short answer is no one is sure because the problem is still under investigation. This has some car owners confused and worried. Investigators think they have found a concentration of defective inflators inside the high-humidity zone. But there are still a lot of humid locations outside those areas. Takata says the cars are safe if they're outside the high-humidity area. It's difficult to tell if your car has a Takata air bag inflator. You can try asking your dealer, but even they may not know. Q: Why doesn't the government just order a national recall of all Takata air bag inflators? A: Safety regulators say two incidents outside of current recall zones involving driver's side air bags are cause for a national recall. Takata disagrees. That could mean civil fines and a court date for Takata. Regulators can go to court to force Takata to do a recall, but they have to hold a public hearing first. Q: What's next? A: Other automakers are likely to follow Honda's lead in doing a national driver's side recall. And the investigation will continue into passenger side problems. Takata could wind up being fined and face court action for defying the government's demand for the national recall.","The inflators, made by Japanese supplier Takata Corp., can explode with too much force under certain conditions .

"Falcao Fever has struck London with 13,000 tickets sold in the first four days of ticket sales for the friendly between the United States and Colombia at Craven Cottage. Jurgen Klinsmann's team take on the Colombians on November 14 and the initial surge of demand was so great that the Fulham website crashed. It will be the first time the USA have staged a home game at the Cottage, where there are so many connections to a club dubbed FulhAmerica across the Atlantic Ocean because of former stalwarts like Brian McBride and Clint Dempsey and Fulham's American owner Shad Khan. There has been huge demand for the friendly between Colombia and the US at Craven Cottage thanks to the presence of Manchester United's on-loan striker Radamel Falcao . Real Madrid midfielder and World Cup Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez is also likely to feature . There is a strong 20,000 Colombian community in the capital, too, and it could be close to capacity with the lure of seeing Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao and Real Madrid's James Rodriguez adding appeal for the neutral fans. Falcao has played only five times since moving the England in August has missed the draw against Chelsea on Sunday with injury. United fans will be both keen to see more of him and relieved Colombia are coming to England to play after their previous friendly fixtures were in North America. Fulham's American contingent are also excited about the game, which is two days after a game against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on November 12. USA have never played at the Cottage before but Fulham have strong connections with America . Falcao, along with Rooney, misses Manchester United's clash with Chelsea but should now be available . 'It's the perfect fit,' said McBride, who is on Khan's five-man panel to identify the club's next manager, and former Fulham and US captain Carlos Bocanegra added: 'I'm thrilled that the US team will play at a stadium that has meant so much to the American players who got their chance at Fulham. 'The fans there were incredibly supportive of us, and we have so many great memories there. Craven Cottage has one of the most intimate atmospheres I've ever played in. Sitting in the Cottage is like having a rooftop seat at Wrigley Field – it's an experience every fan should have in their lifetime.' Fulham fans will be interested to see if Klinsmann names Emerson Hyndman in his squad after the 18-year-old from the club's academy made his senior US debut against the Czech Republic in September. Owner Khan will be in London next month when his NFL team the Jacksonville Jaguars play at Wembley against the Dallas Cowboys on November 9.

"The search for a Canadian man and a Japanese woman who went missing during a fishing trip in Montana has been suspended due to  severe weather conditions. It is believed 56-year-old father-of-two Danny Heyland and 75-year-old Fuki Nishibayashi fell into Mission Lake - known for its cutthroat and rainbow trout - while out on the water on November 22. The body of their friend, 63-year-old Canadian Kazuhiko Hayashizaki was discovered by divers three days later but now the lake has frozen over and heavy snowfall has made it almost impossible to get to. Missing: It is believed 56-year-old father-of-two Danny Heyland (left) and 75-year-old Fuki Nishibayashi (right) fell into Mission Lake, known for its cutthroat and rainbow trout, while out on the water on November 22 . There were no visible signs of trauma on Hayashizaki's body indicating a struggle, according to the Glacier County sheriff’s office. Relatives of the fishermen reported them missing when they did not return from their one-day fishing trip in late November. They were meant to be joined by another man, who ended up staying home for health reasons. A pickup truck that the trio were travelling in was discovered at Mission Lake, along with fishing gear and Heyland’s cell phone. Recovered: The body of their friend, 63-year-old Canadian Kazuhiko Hayashizaki was discovered by divers three days later . Officers began to comb the area, using underwater sonar and scuba equipment and that's when Hayashizaki's body was discovered. Heyland’s sister, Jude Heyland, told the Calgary Sun that the family wasn’t expecting good news. 'He was enjoying what he loved to the end. We’re just wanting closure,' she said. Heyland had apparently accompanied his two friends on fishing trips to Montana before and was a seasoned fisherman. Treacherous conditions: The search for Heyland and  Nishibayashi has been suspended now that Mission Lake (pictured) has frozen over and heavy snowfall has made it almost impossible to get to . The Claresholm, Alberta resident worked as a psychiatric nurse while Nishibayashi was a retired language teacher from the University of Lethbridge. Hayashizaki, also retired, was a well-known table tennis athlete in the Lethbridge area. The three anglers had reportedly enjoyed lunch Saturday afternoon before venturing onto Mission Lake. Glacier County deputies suspect they might have fallen through ice on the lake. The agency will return to monitor the area when road and weather conditions allow. Sgt. Judd Milender said in a statement Tuesday that the sheriff's office is 'committed' to recovering Heyland and Nishibayashi.","It is believed 56-year-old Danny Heyland and 75-year-old Fuki Nishibayashi fell into Mission Lake on November 22 .

"The 20-year-old boyfriend of a troubled schoolgirl who took her own life was later arrested on suspicion of child sex offences, it emerged today. An inquest yesterday heard how Marcus Webb discovered the body of his girlfriend Ashli Blake, 15, in September at the foot of a historic monument near Rockbourne, Hampshire. Prior to her death Ashli, who had a history of mental health problems, had sent him a text message threatening to 'jump off the tower', the inquest heard. Investigation: Marcus Webb, 20 (left) was dating Ashli Blake, 15 (right) who took her own life in September, an inquest heard. It has emerged he was since arrested on suspicion of child sex offences . Today Hampshire Police confirmed a 20-year-old man, confirmed as Mr Webb by his father, was arrested on November 25 on suspicion of child sex offences. He has not been charged with an offence and was bailed until February 6 while investigations continue. A spokesman for Hampshire Constabulary said: 'A 20-year-old man from the Fordingbridge area has been arrested on suspicion of engaging in sexual activity with a child and possessing indecent images in an investigation related to this death. 'He has been bailed until February pending further enquiries.' Police declined to comment further. Mr Webb's father Mervyn, 54, said police quizzed his son last week and he collected him from the station later in the day. Tragedy: Ashli, pictured, was found dead by her boyfriend after a frantic search in the early hours . He said: 'The police picked him up and he got taken in for questioning by officers. I had to go and collect him from Winchester. 'I spoke with his mother today and she told me Marcus is still more than upset about it all.' Winchester Coroner's Court yesterday heard how Ashli, who was born with the surname Cook, was found dead by her boyfriend in the early hours of September 21. She sent a text to him which read: 'I am going to jump off the tower.' Mr Webb told the inquest he had not believed her threats at first, because she had made similar comments previously. But he launched a desperate search when he and her family failed to get hold of her on the day of her death. Mr Webb said he had visited the monument several times with Ashli. In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Webb said: 'I feel so guilty and I feel like it was my fault, she told me she was going to kill herself and even told me where she was going to do it and I laughed at her because I didn't believe her. 'Ashli meant more than life itself to me, I would do nothing to hurt her, I now feel there's no reason being here.' Ashli's mother, Canasta Blake, 37, told the inquest in a statement: 'They had made plans for the rest of their lives together - at 16 she was going to move in with him. 'She was besotted with him. She was always worried about him and what he was doing. 'I do not understand why she did this, she had everything to live for and often spoke of the future. Ashli's mother Canasta Blake (right) was supported at the inquest by her partner Craig Warrilow (left) 'I think, for her age, she was immature, in her laughing, giggling and making up silly words. Ashli was a lovely young girl, was imaginative, different and quirky, she had her own special dress sense. 'She would have grown up to be a lovely person.' Ms Blake added that Ashli was working hard at her studies and had told family members she wanted to become an art therapist or an accountant. The coroner was told Ashli had suffered 'some bullying problems' at Burgate School in her home town of Fordingbridge. And Ashli's GP, Dr Charlotte Hillsley, at Fordingbridge Surgery, said she had suffered from low moods and sleeping problems. She had previously been referred to the Hampshire Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services but had been discharged. However, in July she had returned to the surgery and was referred again to the clinic and was placed on its waiting list. In a statement read to the inquest, Dr Hillsley said: 'Ashli had low mood and poor sleep and was struggling with bullying at school. 'Her mother had told me she had removed razor blades from the house and taken them to work with her because she was concerned that she may self-harm.' Pathologist Dr Eleanor Jaynes told the inquest the schoolgirl had taken no alcohol or drugs prior to her death and had died of multiple traumatic injuries due to a fall from a height. Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame Short recorded a verdict that she had intended to take her own life. Ashli Blake, 15, was  found dead in a field next to a historic monument in Hampshire on September 21 . He said: 'Ashli was a deeply troubled girl but I find that she chose to end her life on this occasion. 'It's clear that she had a boyfriend, Marcus Webb, and I find that she was very much in love with him to a degree that only a teenager can be.' In the wake of her death, staff at The Burgate School said they were 'shocked and saddened' to hear of the tragedy. A school spokesman said: 'We are shocked and saddened to hear the tragic news that one of our Year 11 students has died. 'Ashli was an absolutely delightful, caring and mature young lady. 'She was working hard at school and was very well regarded and respected by staff and students alike. 'The school is pulling together as a community and supporting each other.

"Former head teacher Alexandru Grigore Popescu donated his body, pictured, to medical science . A Romanian school has been told they can keep their skeleton staff after education officials discovered they were using the bones of a former headmaster to teach anatomy. Alexandru Grigore Popescu had been working at the rural Puchenii Mosneni elementary school in south-eastern Romania's Prahova county for 50 years until his death. He said in his will that he had always wanted to have a skeleton in the class for biology lessons. It had never been possible, but in his will he had arranged for his skeleton to be cleaned and professionally put back together so it could be hung in the classroom where he had taught kids for 50 years. But the skeleton had been confiscated when health and safety officials discovered it was the real thing on a visit to the school and insisted on having it checked to see if it was hygienic. But now after being professionally checked and specially treated to make sure it was safe, and put in a glass case, the skeleton has now been returned to the school. Although it may seem grisly kids at the school said they found it really helpful during classes to have the skeleton, and were pleased to see a return. The former headteacher Popescu had started work as a teacher at the school in the Puchenii Mosneni commune in 1908. History teacher Sorin Stanciu said: 'He was made head teacher 10 years after starting working there and was famous for the fact that he never missed a class. His skeleton was made into a display in the 1960s after his death and he hasn't missed a class since then either.' The skeleton is now being kept in a glass case just to make doubly sure that it is not only healthy but also that none of the kids are tempted to mess around with it. Sorin added: 'I think having our own skeleton is really one of the reasons that we always do really well with students graduating in the sciences and in particular going on to study medicine.' Popescu taught at the school for 50 years and wanted to continue in education after his death . Education officials determined that the skeleton was hygienic and allowed it to remain in the classroom . Popescu first arrived at the school in 1908 and remained on until his death more than 50 years later . He admitted that not many however went on to become teachers, but said it was nothing to do with the fact that they were worried about ending up as teaching aids themselves. The current headteacher Violeta Badea said: 'There is nobody around now that remembers him as a teacher but I think you can say that from the shape of his chin he was probably an extremely determined and decisive individual and a man with a very powerful personality, which explains his enormous attachment to the school, this community and its children. 'The professor's wish was fulfilled because he did not want to be put six feet under the ground but rather he wanted to be placed in the back of the classroom, which has been done as he wanted so that he could continue to assist classes. One of the pupils told local TV: 'He donated his body so that we could study biology better. Instead of reading off a book, we look at the skeleton and understand better.' Another added: 'At the beginning I thought it was something weird because I hadn't seen a real skeleton, but now I'm used to him.'","Alexandru Grigore Popescu taught at his Romanian school for 50 years .

"Gang leader Tavon 'Bulldog' White (pictured), described a culture of corruption inside Baltimore City Detention Center . A Violent gang had such control over a notorious jail that they had a Minister for Education and Minister for Finance, a court heard. Gang leader, Tavon 'Bulldog' White, described a culture of corruption inside the centuries-old Baltimore City Detention Center, led by a group that had its own language and laws and authorities. The Black Guerilla Family's hierarchy even included a 'minister of education' who quizzed members on gang literature and a 'minister of finance' who managed the profits sent by cellphones from behind bars, the court was told. White testified that the gang controlled life in the jail and that he directed guards motivated by sex and money to smuggle in drugs and cellphones and facilitate attacks on inmates who challenged his authority. The gang's smuggling schemes even fund the bail that frees gang members who can't pay to get sprung from jail, he testified this week. Gang leaders, not guards, were the ultimate authority inside the jail, he said. 'We're about to go into a strange place, an upside-down world where inmates ran the prison and correctional officers took directions from the gang leader,' prosecutor Robert Harding told jurors in opening statements. White described a gang-run economy made possible by official corruption. White was once the government's primary target, but has since become the prosecutors' most valuable asset, providing information that led to a 160-count indictment against 44 people. He is testifying against the few who did not plead guilty: five corrections officers, one kitchen worker and two inmates on trial in federal court in Baltimore. White, who impregnated four of the guards while in the jail on an attempted murder charge, said he never forced a guard to participate. 'I didn't have to,' White said. 'I had my children's mothers, and plenty of other guards willing to do it for money.' The vast majority of the Baltimore jail's guards are women. One guard who had a child with White had 'Tavon' tattooed on her wrist. Another who had two of his children tattooed 'Tavon' on her neck. The Black Guerilla Family had such control over Baltimore City Detention Center (pictured) that they had a Minister for Education and Minister for Finance, a court heard . Defense attorneys have tried to discredit White's testimony by drawing attention to his plea deal with prosecutors, which could potentially result in reduced time in prison. The Black Guerilla Family has a national presence but is particularly strong in Maryland, where many guards and inmates come from the same impoverished communities. And inside the Baltimore jail, there was plenty of money to be made, White said. According to one search warrant, graffiti painted on a jail wall named 14 guards willing to have sex with inmates for $150 a tryst, including two of the women White impregnated. White told jurors that his gang enforced its monopoly by having the minister of finance collect a 10 percent tax on any contraband smuggled in by unaffiliated inmates. The gang also decided which inmates guards could choose to be 'working men,' taking jobs as janitors, launderers or kitchen workers that provided more mobility and access, the court heard. Drugs and cellphones would be hidden inside walls and ceilings, he said. Inmates paid guards by arranging for cash to change hands outside or by texting codes on their cellphones to draw on prepaid debit cards. Gang members enlisted guards to carry parcels to inmates on other floors or wings of the crowded jail, and the proceeds 'went into a finance bank,' White explained. 'It went towards funding BGF members in whatever they may need. If a member came in who was indigent, we could provide money in their account for commissary, or paying bail. 'We'd take the money out of the finance account and give it to someone responsible and they would pay the bail,' White testified. Tavon White testified that gang leaders, not guards, were the ultimate authority inside Baltimore City Detention Center in Baltimore . White said one of the guards on trial, Travis Paylor, eagerly made deals to pick up packages of drugs on the street and smuggle them inside. Paylor then delivered a menu of illegal goods to inmates for set prices, White said. 'I spoke to him every day he was at work,' White told the jury. 'Most times it was a package deal: one item for $300, three items for $500. Could be 50 Percocets, an ounce of marijuana, a cellphone, or a cellphone and two cans of tobacco -- any three items.' White said another defendant, guard Ashley Newton, allowed the gang to stab an inmate accused of killing a gang member outside. Cellphones were so widely available, White said, that he was able to call a fellow inmate on a smuggled phone from a 'lockup' where he had been sent as punishment for having yet another phone in his cell. White testified that he personally saw one defendant, kitchen worker Michelle McNair, smuggle tobacco in between her thighs. Earlier, Wendell M. 'Pete' France, an operations director for the state's prisons, described guards carrying contraband inside their lunches and in other ways that defied pat-down searches. 'If they are secreted in a body cavity you aren't going to find them,' France testified. White, now serving a 20-year sentence for attempted murder at a location his attorneys will not disclose, was asked about the gang's 'constitutions' which include 'Once you pledge you take it to the grave,' and 'We do not participate in snitching or working with the police.' White said the rules apply to defendant Michelle Ricks, a former guard who he said joined the gang and even recited their oath to him. Judge J. Frederick Motz then interrupted, asking White directly: 'Those rules also apply to you, correct?' White laughed and shifted in his seat, saying 'yeah.' White's lawyer, Gary Proctor, said there was no way back for his client, who pleaded guilty to both state and federal charges during the probe and is hoping cooperation will mean less prison time. 'He didn't just burn his BGF bridges, he napalmed them,' Proctor said.","Black Guerilla Family created positions at Baltimore City Detention Center, court told .

"Holland coach Guus Hiddink blamed Kazakhstan's early goal for the problems his side faced breaking down the visitors before three goals in the last half-hour secured their first win of the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Holland dominated possession but surprisingly fell behind when Renat Abdulin's diving header from a corner in the 17th minute gave goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen no chance. The Kazakhstan defence was like a brick wall that held firm until goals by substitute Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Ibrahim Afellay and a Robin van Persie penalty earned victory in Group A. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar (centre) celebrates with teammates after scoring Holland's equaliser . Guus Hiddink (centre) stands for the Dutch anthem with Danny Blind (left) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (right) 'We were thrown back by their only corner of the game. After the opening goal they lined up in a (wall-like) defence,' Hiddink told reporters. 'Then it is up to you to break through by executing a high-speed passing game, but that didn't always work. It is important not to panic. If you keep playing like that the goals will come sooner or later.' The final 30 minutes proved Hiddink right after a tactical change that was the turning point in the match. The hosts started with a traditional 4-3-3 after the 5-3-2 system former Holland coach Louis van Gaal successfully used at the World Cup in Brazil did not work in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier against the Czech Republic which they lost 2-1. The Dutch players celebrate Robin van Persie's goal that secured three points for Holland . Van Persie (right) and Leroy Fer (left) celebrate Van Persie's late penalty on Friday night . Hiddink added another striker when Huntelaar came on for defensive midfielder Nigel de Jong in the 55th minute. The Schalke captain paired up with national team skipper Robin van Persie up front and rewarded the coach by heading in a free kick six minutes after coming off the bench. Moments later Kazakhstan were reduced to 10 men when striker Baurzhan Dzholchiyev was dismissed for a tackle from behind on Afellay, who put the Dutch ahead with only eight minutes left to cap his return to the national team after 23 months. The Olympiakos Piraeus midfielder had been plagued by injury in the previous two seasons Which kept him out of the team. 'Afellay has had a difficult time. It is good to see he has found the way back up. I think he played with a great drive today,' said Hiddink. Van Persie wrapped up the win with a penalty in the 89th. Hiddink has only four days to determine whether he will stick to a 4-3-3 formation with their next European Championship qualifier against Iceland scheduled for Monday.

"The U.S. State Department ratcheted up the online propaganda war on Wednesday, tweeting a photo composite showing four dead ISIS jihadis who it suggested were killed in overnight airstrikes in Syria – but later deleting it after MailOnline drew attention to the post. The 'Think Again Turn Away' program's Twitter account blasted out the image to its nearly 8,000 followers. The initiative's goal is to dissuade would-be jihadis, including so-called 'foreign fighters,' from joining up with ISIS. The U.S. government used the same account in recent weeks to distribute a mock ISIS recruiting video that lambasted the terror group for mass executions and the destruction of Muslim historical sites. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Advertising with an edge: The US State Department is using a Twitter account to frighten would-be ISIS recruits with images of dead jihadis – implying that any aspiring infidel-hunter could be the next casualty . Shock and awe in 140 characters: America's government is tweeting images like this one taken from the video feed of a drone in mid-attack . Trolling ISIS terrorists is more art than science, but generally includes a heavy dose of military hardware meant to strike fear into the hearts of Islamist radicals . Social media messaging has become a key element in the Obama administration's battle for hearts and minds in the Arab world, especially since ISIS – the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham – began distributing graphic beheading videos that way. State Department Deputy Spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters on Sept. 5 that the anti-jihad campaign had already 'been appearing in Arabic for quite some time. We are doing more in English as well.' The messages are produced by the agency's Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications as a pushback against Islamist terror groups that use online spaces to recruit militants and spread propaganda to young followers. Efforts from ISIS, in particular, have proven effective – and provide ample headaches to the agencies that comprise America's national security infrastructure. The terror army 'operates the most significant propaganda machine of any extremist group,' according to National Counterterrorism Center director Center Matt Olsen. One ISIS-linked Twitter account with nearly 10,000 followers claimed Tuesday night that the 'first victims of air strikes by US on Syria' were 'children and women.' Another tweeted news stories from dubious sources claiming French fighter jets mistakenly bombed Kurdish allies, killing 75 fighters in a friendly-fire cockup. Separately, a weeks-long Twitter campaign centered around the hashtag #AMessageFromISIStoUS spread a series of chest-puffing boasts, including direct threats against the U.S. homeland. That hashtag has since been taken over by Americans who now regularly taunt ISIS Islamists. The American government aims to initiate a similar turnabout on a much larger scale so fewer ISIS sympathizers will give in to the magnetic pull of a firefight in Iraq or Syria. About one-third of the 31,000 fighters available to ISIS today came to Syria and Iraq from other countries, including an estimated 2,000 from Europe and 100 from the United States. In a rare UN Security Council meeting that featured 15 heads of state – not just ambassadors – a unanimous vote advanced a plan to fight terrorism with new legal penalties against 'foreign fighters' UK Prime Minister David Cameron, left, addressed the UN Security Council summit on foreign terrorists after US President Barack Obama used the monthly-rotating gavel to hold the vote . America's messages are 'targeted at potential recruits [and] potential sympathizers,' Harf said, 'to show and expose the brutality of terrorist organizations, including ... ISIS.' The larger goal is 'to point out the fallacies of what they’re talking about, point out the inconsistencies, point out how this is contrary to Islam – and really make very clear what this group is so people don’t join it.' The U.S. and a group of nations, including some from the Arab world, began bombing ISIS targets in Syria on Monday. The Think Again Turn Away campaign's 'recruiting' video went viral three weeks ago; it used the group's own online propaganda footage to reposition murderous jihad as a foolish aspiration. Its opening scene showed a mosque being blown up, followed by a photo of a decapitated body. Viewers were told newly minted ISIS soldiers can learn ‘useful skills’ including bombing mosques with Muslims trapped inside, crucifying fellow Muslims and plundering public resources. It closed with a sarcastic slogan: ‘Travel is inexpensive, because you won't need a return ticket!’ Join today, a mocking State Department 'recruiting' video said, and you too could destroy a Mosque – as ISIS soldiers have done in their sectarian Muslim-on-Muslim holy war . Lampoon: The Obama administration's Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications even poked fun at ISIS recruits for reportedly needing to bone up on their Islam basics before reporting for duty . Discouraging American 'foreign fighters' too: When these two Minnesota-based ISIS recruits turned up dead, the State Department hung their digital heads up for everyone in the US to see . On Wednesday in New York City, all 15 members of the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution that requires all 193 UN countries to prosecute anyone who travels abroad to help ISIS. The same rule will apply to people who finance global terror networks. Countries will also be expected to close their borders to their own citizens if they return home after fighting alongside the ISIS menace. President Barack Obama, who chaired the council meeting, said it would be 'legally binding.' But in reality the UN has no means of enforcing its resolutions, and relies largely on peer pressure and threats of country-to-country sanctions to keep nations in line.","'Think Again Turn Away' social media campaign aims to dissuade would-be jihadis from joining up with ISIS .

"The Air Force is preparing to court-martial a female nuclear missile launch officer on drug and obstruction-of-justice charges following an investigation that led to the disclosure of a separate exam-cheating scandal that implicated nearly 100 nuclear officers. Second Lieutenant Nicole Dalmazzi, 25, of the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, was the first missileer, as launch officers are called, known to have been charged since the drug investigation was made public in January. The investigation came to light on the same day that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited the headquarters of the Air Force's land-based nuclear missile force. Dalmazzi is a missile launch officer at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, home to a third of the U.S. Air Force's Minuteman 3 missile capability . Four missileers were subjects of the drug investigation, three were at Malmstrom and one at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. The twin disclosures of alleged exam cheating and illegal drug use accelerated a wave of embarrassing news about the nuclear missile corps, which has been beset with discipline problems, low morale, leadership lapses and resource shortages. Last month, Hagel announced plans for top-to-bottom changes in how the force is managed and operated. Ten days later he resigned, although Air Force officials said they were confident the reforms will move ahead. Dalmazzi was charged with illegal drug use and obstructing the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) probe by dyeing her hair to 'alter the results of potential hair-follicle drug tests,' according to Josh Aycock, a spokesman at Malmstrom. He would not elaborate on her alleged actions or the tests. He said her court-martial was scheduled for January 21. Efforts to reach Dalmazzi for comment on Tuesday were unsuccessful. The nuclear missile corps has been beset by embarrassing news over the past year, with Defense Secretary Hagel promising a shake-up of management and operations ten days before he resigned . The investigation began in August 2013 at Edwards Air Force Base in California. When investigators examined the cellphones of two airmen at Edwards they found text messages to or from 11 other Air Force officers at several other air bases. The text messages detailed 'specific illegal drug use that included synthetic drugs, ecstasy and amphetamines,' according to a report released in March that looked mainly at missileers' exam cheating but also traced a connection between the drug and cheating issues. Two of the 11 officers were assigned to Malmstrom; investigators determined that both had used personal cellphones to discuss illegal drug activity as well as answers to routine proficiency tests taken by all missileers, according to the March investigative report. That investigation focused on the exam cheating, whereas the drug probe was done separately as a criminal inquiry by the Office of Special Investigations, which has not publicly announced its results. Eventually the number of Malmstrom missileers implicated in the drug probe grew to three. The Air Force concluded that the exam cheating was confined to missileers at Malmstrom. Disciplinary action for the alleged cheating is being handled separately from the drug cases, although the Air Force has said that three officers at Malmstrom who were suspected of illegal drug activities also were alleged to have shared classified exam materials. On Tuesday, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said the OSI criminal probe is complete. 'We've made a big point about accountability,' James said. 'Standards are standards, and when people fail in integrity, service and excellence there are appropriate accountability measures. 'We've made a big point of that and that's true across the Air Force and it has been, of course, particularly true this past year in the ICBM community.' As a missileer Dalmazzi was trained to operate the Minuteman 3 missile, which is armed with a nuclear warhead and stands ready for launch on short notice from an underground silo that is electronically linked to a launch control center, also underground, where two missileers are on duty around the clock. Because of the sensitive nature of the job, with its many classified procedures and potential for costly mistakes, any allegation of drug use by missileers is concerning. A RAND Corporation report last year on workplace stresses for missileers and others in the nuclear missile corps found some suffering 'burnout.' It also found an elevated rate of behavioral issues, including domestic violence. Dalmazzi's 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom operates 150 of the Air Force's 450 Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. The other 300 are evenly divided between Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. The Air Force also operates a fleet of nuclear-capable bomber aircraft.","Second Lieutenant Nicole Dalmazzi, 25, based at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, was the first missileer to be charged in investigation .

"When most children dress up as their favourite superhero, it is usually just to play imaginary games with their friends in the back garden. But for five-year-old Harley Renshaw, it is in order to help him be brave while he undergoes chemotherapy treatment for an aggressive form of childhood cancer. Harley was diagnosed with cancer in his kidney, lung, bone and neck just after starting primary school and had to have 14 sessions of chemotherapy lasting three months. Harley Renshaw, 5, had to undergo three months of chemotherapy after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. During the treatment session he wore a mask (left) decorated like his favourite Ninja Turtle . While he was treated at The Christie Hospital, Manchester, he had to wear a special face mask which he decorated like his favourite Ninja Turtle to help him feel brave. Mother Stacey Parker, 23, and dad Oliver Renshaw, 25, said Harley had been amazing during his treatment, also making special beads of courage. Ms Parker said: 'Not once did he complain about going for treatment. He has a big scar right across his belly which he calls his ""pirate scar"". We couldn't be any prouder of our boy. 'He has had such a lot to deal with this year and he just takes it all in his stride and gets on with it. He is a true inspiration and he is our hero.' The family only discovered Harley was ill shortly after he started school, when his mother took him to a walk-in clinic with a pain in his stomach. He was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare and aggressive childhood cancer, and was sent to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital to undergo pioneering treatment. He has since had 80 days of intensive chemotherapy and has had an operation to remove his kidney tumour. Harley was diagnosed with cancer in his kidney, lung, bones and neck after mother Stacey took him to a walk in clinic with a stomach pain. The five-year-old has also been given an award (left) A month later he was back at hospital for a stem cell transplant, fighting back from complications to return home for his fifth birthday, before undergoing 14 days of radiotherapy. He is now facing a further five months of treatment as he is given five rounds of immunotherapy. Stacey said: 'When we received Harley's diagnosis, we were in complete shock. Our world came crashing down and we were terrified. 'But not once did Harley complain about going for treatment. The hospital staff were amazed at how well he behaved during his radiotherapy and how he managed to keep so still.' Harley has now been awarded one of Cancer Research UK's Little Star Awards which acknowledges the unique challenges faced by youngsters who encounter cancer. Cancer Research UK is calling on people to nominate more Little Stars. The awards, in partnership with TK Maxx, are open to under-18s who have cancer or who have been treated for the disease in the last five years.","Harley Renshaw, 5, diagnosed with cancer after starting primary school .

"A young mother who lost her parents and sister to cancer has refused tests for the disease - because she fears being handed a death sentence. Diana Barrett, 22, has been advised to have checks after both her parents died from bowel cancer and her sister was killed by a brain tumour. But despite losing her entire family to the disease, the mum-of-one said she would rather live in blissful ignorance than be told she is doomed to develop the disease. 'I know people will think it is irresponsible but the truth is after everything that has happened to my family I am terrified at the prospect of what doctors might say,' she said. 'I would rather not know.' Brave Diana Barrett, 22, pictured with her one-year-old son, Darcy, has said she would rather not know if she is going to develop cancer . Miss Barrett, from Coleford, Gloucester, was only eight years old when her father Robert, 35, passed away from bowel cancer, aged 35, in 2001. Nine years later her mother, Tracey, 40, developed the same disease and died on Mother's Day in March 2009. In a final cruel twist, Miss Barrett's sister Sherrie developed a brain tumour in 2011 and lost her battle with the disease last year, aged 26. The mother to one-year-old Darcy, said: 'Nothing can prepare you for losing a mother or father but I lost everyone I loved so young. 'I've been dealt a bad hand but have managed to keep going. 'When I held Darcy in my arms for the first time I felt an overwhelming amount for love for him. 'He gives me a purpose in life. We're a little family but we're a happy one.' When their dad died, Miss Barrett was comforted by older sister Sherrie and the family briefly found happiness when mum Tracey met a new partner and had two more children. Miss Barrett's father Robert (right) died of bowel cancer in 2001 and her mother Tracey (left) died nine years later of the same disease . Miss Barrett (right) pictured with her sister, Sherrie, who died at just 26 after developing a brain tumour . Miss Barrett (front and centre) pictured with her mother, Tracey, sister, Sherrie, paternal grandmother, Gene, and father, Robert, during a family holiday to Disneyland . But in late 2007, when Miss Barrett was just 14, Tracey, 40, a doll maker, was diagnosed with colon cancer after she started having pains in her lower back. In the weeks that followed, her mum underwent keyhole surgery, radiotherapy and chemo. Tracey survived Christmas and died on Mother's Day in March 2009. She said: 'I was devastated. I couldn't believe I'd lost both my parents. It was impossible to take in and I started suffering from panic attacks.' The grieving sisters had happier news when Sherrie found out she was expecting her first child, but it was short-lived when 36 weeks into the pregnancy Sherrie started to suffer from severe headaches and an MRI scan revealed she had a brain tumour. She said: 'They told her she had a rare brain tumour the size of a pear. They said it was life-threatening and had to perform an emergency c-section so they could operate on the tumour.' Fortunately, her baby boy was delivered healthy weighing 7.3lbs. Miss Barrett herself fell pregnant in February 2013 after a whirlwind romance and while the pregnancy wasn't planned, she was thrilled and couldn't wait to start a family. She said: 'I was over the moon but also terrified to bring a baby into the world in case I or the baby suffered the same fate as my family.' Less than two weeks after Miss Barrett gave birth in November 2013, Sherrie died. 'It was the most difficult time of my life,' she said. Less than two weeks after Miss Barrett gave birth to her first child her sister, who she is pictured with as a child, died of a brain tumour . Miss Barrett says she does not think that it is 'healthy to know' if she is likely to develop cancer in the future . 'I would cry every day and felt scared and helpless. 'Not only would Darcy never know his granddad or grandmother, but now he would never know his aunty either. 'But I had to stay strong as I had a baby who depended on me.' Miss Barrett said her family's bad luck has baffled doctors who have advised her to undergo genetic testing, but she has refused because she fears the results. 'I don't think it's healthy to know,' she explained. 'If they told me it was likely I was going to develop cancer in the future it would be hard to carry on on a daily basis. 'Of course, I think about it every day - more now than ever that I am a mother - but I can't curl up and die, I have to keep going for the sake of my son. 'Every day I cherish and live my life to the full.'","Mother-of-one Diana Barrett lost both her parents and sister to cancer .

"Just a day after the CIA chose to bypass a spy for their top position because of her waterboarding past, the name of the man they chose instead was leaked on Twitter despite his still being undercover. The government is remaining mum, but Francis Archibald is likely the next spy chosen to head the Central Intelligence Agency’s National Clandestine Service. ‘New head of #CIA clandestine service was head of #LatinAmerica Division since ca 2011. Francis ‘Frank’ Archibald, 57,’ tweeted former Washington Post assistant editor John Dinges on Wednesday. Leaked: The name of the man chosen as top CIA spy was leaked on Twitter Wednesday, though he remains undercover as the agency chief in Latin America . The leak was likely related to a report Tuesday that the post would be filled by the head of the CIA's Latin American Division, a former station chief in Pakistan who former officials said once ran the covert action that helped remove Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic from power. The top spy job was originally supposed to go to one of the agency’s highest-ranking women, an agent identified only as G. But cries rang out over ‘G’s’ heavy involvement with a secret CIA prison in Thailand where high-profile terrorist suspects were subjected to so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding and sleep deprivation. The officer briefly ran a secret CIA prison where accused terrorists Abu Zubayada and Abd al-Nashiri were waterboarded in 2002, according to current and former U.S. intelligence officials. Report: Former Washington Post reporter John Dinges tweeted that the next head spy will be Francis Archibald, and Jeff Stein (pictured) of And Magazine quickly confirmed . She was also a senior manager in the Counterterrorism Center helping run operations in the war on terror and served as chief of staff to Jose Rodriguez and helped carry out his order that the CIA destroy its waterboarding videos. That order prompted a lengthy Justice Department investigation that ended without charges. Shortly after Dinges’ tweet, reports Gawker, longtime intelligence reporter Jeff Stein confirmed Archibald’s pick in AND Magazine, in a report that also supports the claim that ‘G’ was passed over for her interrogation ties. ‘Most likely Archibald was chosen because there's not a whiff of scandal in his background, as far as we know,’ Stein wrote. ‘""Bland"" is a word that comes to mind.’ The CIA, while announcing G’s bypassing, denied it was the veteran spy’s waterboarding past led to the decision. ‘The assertion she was not chosen because . of her affiliation with the (counter terrorism) mission is absolutely . not true,’ said CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood. Urged: The Senate Intelligence Committee's Dianne Feinstein reportedly asked the CIA not to appoint a previous pick, named 'G,' because of ties to torture . Professional: The CIA maintains director John Brennan, pictured, chose Archibald over G for reasons apart from G's 'counter terrorism' ties . Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, has criticized the interrogation program and personally urged CIA Director John Brennan not to promote G, according to a former senior intelligence briefed on the call. More than a decade after it last used waterboarding, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, the CIA is still hounded by the legacy of a tactic that the U.S. government regarded as torture before the Bush administration authorized its use against terrorist suspects. Brennan's ties to the interrogation program delayed for years his nomination to lead the CIA and Feinstein wants the agency to declassify a 6,000-page report on the interrogation program. Government officials have neither confirmed nor denied Archibald's appointment.","Francis 'Frank' Archibald is reportedly the next CIA head honcho as previous pick, a woman called only 'G,' was labelled too controversial for her waterboarding past .
Government officials have not confirmed the next leader of the CIA's National Clandestine Service will be Archibald, currently head spy in Latin America, because his identity is still supposed to be a secret ."

"The United States government is sending thousands of military troops to the west African nation of Liberia as part of the Obama administration's Ebola virus-response strategy, the White House said late Monday night.

AFRICOM is set to send 3,000 American military officers and enlisted personnel to Liberia soon . Modern-day lepers: In Liberia, suspected Ebola patients like this man (right) are seen most days lying near busy streets -- with most people terrified of touching them . Some of what America's armed personnel will do in Liberia is unclear. The White House said 'many' of them will be stationed at an 'intermediate staging base' where they will supervise the movement of medical staff, supplies and heavy equipment. AFRICOM already warns its own personnel that they should 'avoid nonessential travel to Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia.' And the Defense Department is concerned, one Pentagon official told MailOnline, about the public perceptions aroused when American G.I.s patrol ground zero in a disease outbreak that could plunge three or more countries into chaos if it worsens significantly. Combat soldiers and Marines 'will be on hand and ready for anything,' said the official, who has knowledge of some, but not all, of the Ebola-related planning. 'But hopefully it will be all logistics and hospital-building.' 'The president has ordered us to help, and we're eager to do it,' he said. 'Now it looks like we're going to be the lead dog, and that's bound to make a lot of people nervous. It's understandable.' 'But no one wants U.S. personnel enforcing someone else's martial law if things go south and the entire region is at risk.' 'At this point in a response like this, we would normally play a support role for USAID and the CDC,' he said, referring to the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. The Fox News Channel reported on Sunday that the U.S. military's emphasis on Ebola prevention, driven by President Barack Obama, has stretched thin most if not all of its other missions. A senior military official told Fox that General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a recent meeting that 'the Department of Defense's number one priority is combating Ebola.' The network's source commented that 'we don't need to be taking planners away from the CT [counter-terrorism] mission, and that is what is going on.' Defense spending is down 21 per cent since 2010, the first fiscal year for which the Obama administration presided over the federal budget. But the president is insisting that the military carry much of the burden in Africa. 'National security': President Obama said during a recent NBC News interview that African Ebola might be a threat to the U.S. if it was not crushed out quickly, and allowed to mutate . State of the art: In America, the few known Ebola patients -- all of them flown home from Africa -- have been cared for in high-tech isolation pods like this one, shown during a biocontainment drill . Squalor: In Liberia, suspected Ebola patients often end up in the care of family members in conditions where poor sanitation and minimal medical care contribute to a township-wide downward spiral . In a Sept. 7 interview on NBC's 'Meet the Press,' he called it a 'national security priority.' 'If we don't make that effort now, and this spreads not just through Africa, but other parts of the world, there's the prospect then that the virus mutates, it becomes more easily transmittable, and then it could be a serious danger to the United States,” said Obama. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest fielded questions Monday about the threat that a mutated Ebola virus could endanger the American population. 'Right now,' Earnest said, 'the risk of an Ebola outbreak in the United States is very low. But that risk would only increase if there were not a robust response on the part of the United States.' 'And that's why the president – among other things – that's one of the things that's motivating the president to direct an aggressive response.' Obama will visit the CDC in Atlanta on Tuesday for a situation update, and to give a public speech about the need to regard Africa's public health crisis as a threat to the United States. Earnest's office said Monday night that military engineers would be on hand in Liberia to build makeshift hospitals, and that the American government 'will help recruit and organize medical personnel to staff them.' The Pentagon has also committed to construct and staff at least one 25-bed 'field-deployable hospital,' in Liberia, but The Washington Post reported last week that it will treat only infected health care workers – not civilian victims of the outbreak. Scary: LIberians have become accustomed to seeing hazmat-outfitted medics and burial workers in their neighborhoods, but American military troops will be an entirely different sight . The Ebola virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids, including blood, sweat and saliva. In some African cultures, preparing the dead for cremation involves physical contact with their remains -- something that has allowed the disease to spread quickly . The U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps will send 65 administrators, clinicians and support staff to run the facility. That's a change from a week ago, when Army Colonel Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, told Reuters that the military would turn the field hospital over to the Liberian government after it was built. 'No U.S. personnel right now will be providing patient care,' Col. Warren said on Sept. 8. We are deploying the hospital facility, setting it up, stockpiling it. We'll turn it over to the government of Liberia and then the DoD (Defense Department) personnel will depart,"" he said. The World Health Organization says the current Ebola Virus Disease outbreak, a form of hemorrhagic fever, has infected more than 4,900 west Africans and killed at least 2,400, mostly in Liberia. The State Department purchased a shipment of 5,000 body bags for its USAID mission in Liberia last month. USAID is also procuring up to 160,000 hazmat suits for medical workers. The White House aid Monday night that USAID will soon airlift 130,000 of those 'sets of personal protective equipment' to health care workers in affected countries.","The Obama administration said late Monday night that the U.S. military will set up a command post in Monrovia, Liberia, the Ebola outbreak's epicenter .

"Edinburgh Zoo is celebrating the birth of Rica, its first ever armadillo pup. The three-banded armadillo, a native to Brazil, was born to mum Rio and dad Rodar in August weighing just 0.1lb (81g). Keepers said the animal has rapidly 'grown in to her shell' and already weighs around 1lb (450g) -having grown more than five times her birthweight to the size of a grapefruit. New arrival: Edinburgh Zoo is celebrating the birth of Rica, its first ever armadillo pup (pictured). The three-banded armadillo, a native to Brazil, was born to mum Rio and dad Rodar in August weighing just 0.1lb (81g) Gareth Bennett, senior presentations keeper at Edinburgh Zoo, said the birth was an 'amazing achievement' as Rio and Rodar only arrived from Plock, in Poland, in March. 'This is the first birth of any armadillo species at Edinburgh Zoo, and it is amazing how quickly little Rica is growing up,' he said. The Brazilian three-banded armadillo has a blackish-brown armour plating, which covers its body, head and tail. The plating comes in the form of two domed shells which are separated by three armoured bands of flexible of skin, allowing the armadillo to roll up into a ball. Family affair: Keepers say the animal has rapidly 'grown in to her shell' and already weighs around 1lb (450g). Here Rica is pictured with her mum, Rio. 'You would never know that Rio was a first time mother as she is incredibly protective of Rica,' said Gareth Bennett, senior presentations keeper at Edinburgh Zoo . The Brazilian three-banded armadillo has a blackish-brown armour plating, which covers their body, head and tail. The plating comes in the form of two domed shells which are separated by three armoured bands of flexible of skin, allowing the armadillo to roll up into a ball. It has a great sense of smell, and uses it to find termites under the soil. The armadillo will thrust its nose into the soil and then use its tongue to reach its prey. The species reaches at most 20 inches (50cm) in length and about 3.3lbs (1.5kg). This has allowed it to survive 140 million years of evolution, but the creature is now listed as 'vulnerable' because it lost nearly 50 per cent of its habitat in the last 15 years. The species produces one single offspring each year, so populations are slow to recover when hit by loss of habitat. This has allowed it to survive 140 million years of evolution, but the creature is now listed as 'vulnerable' because it lost nearly 50 per cent of its habitat in the last 15 years. The Caatinga dry forest, where most of these armadillos live, once covered about 11 per cent of the Brazilian territory, and that has now been reduced to around six per cent. The species produces one offspring each year, so populations are slow to recover when hit by habitat loss. '[Rica] is just amazing to watch, always full of energy and scurrying about her surroundings like a perfectly formed miniature of a fully grown three banded armadillo,' said Mr Bennett. 'For her first few weeks she could not quite roll up into a perfect ball because of her huge claws and softer, smaller shell, but she has now grown into her shell and can quickly pack herself into the tightly sealed ball which adult three-banded armadillos are known for. 'You would never know that Rio was a first time mother as she is incredibly protective of Rica, constantly watching or carrying her, but mum is also very relaxed and has had no problem getting her new-born to suckle from her. A star is born: Rica becomes the zoo's fourth three-banded armadillo, along with parents and ten-year-old Dillon. Mr Bennett said the keepers discovered Rio was pregnant after discovering scratch marks on her back, and an ultrasound scan showed up a peanut-sized baby .

The plating comes in the form of two domed shells which are separated by three armoured bands of flexible of skin, allowing the armadillo to roll up into a ball . 'Rica remains off show for now but she is doing great and will soon be out meeting the public. They grow up very fast - she will reach maturity within a year.' Rica becomes the zoo's fourth three-banded armadillo, along with her parents and ten-year-old 'retired star' Dillon. Mr Bennett said the keepers discovered Rio was pregnant after discovering scratch marks on her back, and an ultrasound scan showed up a peanut-sized baby. 'When she first arrived at Edinburgh Zoo it did not take long for mum Rio to come out of her shell, very quickly becoming one of the stars of the Animal Antics hilltop shows, scurrying about through the feet of the audience,' he said. 'However, after a few months, we noticed a slight change in her body weight and a few scratch marks on her back. Putting two and two together we investigated with an ultrasound and were able to make out a peanut sized little armadillo shape. 'The family all lived together just after the birth, however in the wild all armadillo species are solitary animals. 'We recently had to take dad Rodar away as female armadillos are ready to mate again about two weeks after the birth and another offspring would have been a bit too much for Rio at this stage.'

He was the plucky canine who defied death after surviving a gas chamber when animal control workers tried to put him down. But after coming away from the chamber unscathed and finding a new home, Daniel the beagle has gone from strength to strength and is now even becoming a media star. The miracle dog was abandoned and was due to be put down by workers at the animal control facility in Florence, Alabama in a stainless-steel box. Happy tale: Daniel appears on the Anderson Cooper show with his delighted owners Joe and Jenny Dwyer . Miracle mutt: Daniel went through the gas-filled chamber in a stainless steel box but somehow survived and emerged wagging his tail . Daniel came out of the carbon monoxide-filled chamber wagging his tail however, and has since found a new home after his stay of execution. The brave newly-adopted pet, who was named after the biblical figure who survived the lion's den, made a television appearance on the Anderson Cooper chat show and looked in good health. He has been adopted by Jenny and Joe Dwyer, who rehomed the lucky beagle from Eleventh Hour Rescue, the organisation who took possession of him last month. About half of applications from people around the country seeking to adopt Daniel said they were not interested in adopting another dog if he was not available. As Daniel excitedly sniffed his way round the chat show set, owner Joe Dwyer, from Nutley, New Jersey, explained: 'As far as we know, he was put into the gas chamber with multiple other dogs. 'When they opened the door after the gas was let in, he came out with his tail wagging, and it's nothing short of a miracle. It's just unbelievable.' The couple adopted Daniel, who has gone to live with them and their four other dogs. Beagle: Daniel, who is better known as the 'Miracle Dog', sits still while waiting for a treat in the home of Mark and Jill Pavlik after surviving the gas chamber . Miracle: Jill Pavlik plays with Daniel moments after arriving home from work. The stray beagle mix cheated death in an Alabama dog pound . Mr Dwyer said he and his family had two ‘meet-and-greets’ with Daniel before being approved for adoption, and the dog has become fast friends with the Nutley family's other four pooches. They have two dachshunds, a beagle mix and a pit bull mix. ‘By Thursday evening they were all lying down together,’ he said. ‘It was wonderful to see.’ Only three animals have survived the gas chamber at the animal control facility in Florence in the past 12 years. 'Maybe God just had a better plan for this one,' city spokesman Phil Stevenson said. He said that the dog may have survived because his breathing was shallow thanks to a cold. Other variables that could allow a dog to survive include the number of animals placed in the chamber. 'Maybe we'll get a cosmetic surgeon to make all our dogs look like Daniel' In addition the concentration of carbon monoxide, whether the chamber is airtight or gas is leaking out and the health of the animal can also have an impact on improving their slim survival chances. At least 15 states, including New Jersey and New York, have banned carbon monoxide for euthanising shelter animals, but it is still a method used in many parts of the country.' Mr Dwyer added that Daniel wasn't put back in the chamber after defying the carbon monoxide because workers 'didn't have the heart to put him back in'. He added: 'They thought that possibly from the after-effects of the gas, he might die during the night. But the next morning he was still wagging his tail.'","Adoptive owners tell remarkable survival story on Anderson Cooper .

"Holed up in a printworks and surrounded by police, killers Said and Cherif Kouachi were unaware that commandos were being tipped off about their every move. For, hidden in a cardboard box just yards away was 27-year-old Lilian Lepere. And he was able to alert police about the location of the gunmen and the layout of the building. For more than six hours the graphic designer passed on crucial information until the siege ended in a bloody shootout as the terrorist brothers, who had vowed to die as martyrs, burst out from their lair all guns blazing and were mown down in a hail of bullets. Police commandos stormed the print works where the Charlie Hebdo gunmen were holed up with a hostage and the terrorist brothers burst out from their lair all guns blazing . A huge ball of fire erupted amid gunfire and explosions as French special forces shot dead the two Charlie Hebdo gunmen . From inside his claustrophobic hideout, Mr Lepere had first sent a text message to his father when the Kouachis took over the print works at Dammartin-en-Goele, a small town just north of Paris. He wrote: ‘I am hidden on the first floor. I think they have killed everyone. Tell the police to intervene.’ It is understood he was in a locked room. He continued to provide vital information to police and special forces via his phone as snipers took up position on surrounding rooftops and helicopters buzzed overhead. Lilian Lepere, 27, hid in a cardboard box as the Charlie Hebdo gunmen held a father-of-two hostage for eight hours . Mr Lepere emerged unscathed from the shootout and was taken to a psychological assessment unit where it is understood he was to be reunited with his family last night. A hostage held at gunpoint by the terrorists was also freed. The Kouachi brothers had been on the run since killing 12 journalists and police officers in a terror raid on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday. As the huge manhunt for them continued, they dumped their stolen getaway car and fled on foot into a forest 50 miles north of the capital. This morning they managed to evade the huge police dragnet and just after 8am hijacked a grey Peugeot 206 being driven by a woman teacher near Montagny-Sainte-Felicite, 30 miles north-east of Paris. Jean Paul Douet, the mayor of the village, said a colleague saw the men force the woman into the back seat. ‘She saw their weapons, and in particular their rocket-propelled grenade launcher,’ he said. The teacher was freed unhurt soon afterwards, then dozens of police cars began chasing the fugitives along the N2 highway towards Paris. During the chase, shots were exchanged. The brothers dumped their car and fled on foot to a family-run printing company on an industrial estate in Dammartin-en-Goele. They burst into the business – posing as armed police – and took the company’s boss hostage. Armed police surrounded the building and sealed off the town of 8,000 people. All businesses closed, nearly 1,000 children were evacuated from schools and the streets were left deserted except for lines of police vehicles and units of heavily armed officers clad in combat gear. Masked and helmeted troopers with automatic weapons were seen peering out of a blue helicopters buzzing overhead. Michel Carn, a resident, said: ‘The whole zone is surrounded. We are confined to our homes. ‘We can hear helicopters and there’s one currently hovering over my house.’ With so many low flying police and army helicopters, some flights were unable to land at Paris’s main Charles de Gaulle airport seven miles away. Incredibly, a salesman visiting the small print works office minutes after the gunmen seized it described an encounter with one of the fugitives – and even unwittingly shook his hand. ‘When I arrived my client came out with an armed man who said he was from the police,’ said the man, who gave his name only as Didier. Al Qaeda brothers Cherif (left) and Said Kouachi were both shot dead by police as they tried to fight their way out of the industrial building .

French special forces sharp shooters on a rooftop at the scene of the bloody siege which saw both brothers mown down in a hail of bullets . ‘My client told me to leave so I left. I was in front of the door. I shook [my client] Michel’s hand and I shook the hand of one of the terrorists.’ He said the black-clad man who was wearing a bullet-proof vest and carrying what looked like a Kalashnikov rifle told him: ‘Leave, we don’t kill civilians anyhow.’ He said: ‘That really struck me, so I decided to call the police. I guess it was one of the terrorists.’ As the standoff continued, police attempted to negotiate with the brothers but were told: ‘We are ready to die as martyrs.’ Officers also scrambled phone signals after the terrorists reportedly called with a criminal associate. As the siege continued, the town mayor’s office appealed on its website for residents to stay behind closed doors. Many workers were forced to stay huddled inside their offices and shops because it was too risky to venture onto the streets. The gunmen's hostage, named as the company's director Michel Catalano (circled), is believed to have been rescued alive .

She was calm but me, I’m scared. I’m really scared,’ the woman said, sobbing. The siege ended at just after 3pm, as dusk fell. Commandos crept on to the roof of the building and set off a series of explosions before colleagues stormed in. At least two military helicopters containing special forces landed on the factory building, another in the grounds.

Defiant to the end, the terrorist brothers charged out firing Kalashnikovs at the security forces before being shot dead. Teenager Atlantis Farina, who lives close to the scene, was returning home when he heard explosions. ‘The ground here started shaking, that is what shocked me most,’ said the 17-year-old. ‘Then there was lots of what sounded like gunfire, it sounded like the suspects were firing back at the police. ‘There was smoke too – like they had thrown a grenade. ‘I am so glad it is over, it brought panic to the area. My mum was very worried, and I was quite scared too.’ Residents living closest to the printworks had been evacuated from their homes minutes earlier, sparking fears the terrorist may have had bombs. Alan Linck, a teacher who lives less than 100 yards from the scene, said: ‘They told us all to go. ‘Anti-vibration strips were fixed on the walls of the houses, I think because they were worried about a bomb explosion. I am very relieved it is all over.’","Lilian Lepere, 27, hid in a box during  siege with Charlie Hebdo gunmen .

"Islamic State militants are planning the creation of a 'cyber caliphate' protected by their own encryption software - from behind which they will launch massive hacking attacks on the U.S. and the West. Both Islamic State and Al Qaeda claim to be actively recruiting skilled hackers in a bid to create a team of jihadist computer experts capable of causing devastating cyber disruptions to Western institutions. They are now boasting it is only a matter of time before their plan becomes a reality. Scroll down for video . ISIS militants marching through the streets of Syria.

Junaid Hussain, who was jailed two years' ago for hacking personal information from Tony Blair, is thought to be spearheading the ISIS cyber team's activities from Syria where he fled to last year . Fox News reported the terror groups were using social media to attract more computer-savvy young recruits. Thought to be among those working within the organisation's cyber team is British jihadist Junaid Hussain, who escaped to Syria while on police bail last year. Hussain, 20, was jailed in 2012 for hacking into former Prime Minister Tony Blair's gmail account and posting the details online. Steve Stalinsky, an executive director of the Middle East Media Research Institute, told Fox News: 'They are forward thinking and are experimenting with hacking. In the future, the jihadists' cyber army's activities will become a daily reality.' It was reported the possible targets of the jihadists' cyber attacks will be the websites of U.S. government organisations, energy companies, transport systems and banks. Islamic State is noted for its use of advanced technology and social media on a scale unprecedented for such rebel groups.

A senior Pentagon official confirmed that 'the U.S. military is ready to conduct direct action against ISIL targets in Syria.' Britain has already drawn-up extensive plans to support the US that includes airstrikes and UK Special Forces forming ‘advisory’ training teams to instruct Kurdish fighters how to use heavy machine guns ‘gifted’ by Britain this week.

"An ostrich caused traffic chaos in this country lane after racing alongside cars at speeds of more than 40mph. The escaped bird was seen dashing past more than 20 cars on the main road between the villages of Rusthall and Speldhurst in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, yesterday. Adult ostriches can run up to 60mph and grow to more than 9ft-tall, and while this youngster is just over 2ft-tall, it was still able to run at more than 40mph, according to locals. An escaped ostrich caused traffic chaos after it was seen dashing past more than 20 cars on this country lane in Tunbridge Wells . Motorists slammed on the brakes after spotting the flightless bird running up and down the busy main road - causing queues of more than 20 minutes between 8.30am and 9am. Jokers have now set up a Twitter account for the bird called TWellsOstrich. Posts include: 'Time to hit the road! Watch out for me this morning' and 'I'm very tired from running around Tunbridge Wells all day!' Other posts include 'There I was confidently gambolling down the road and everyone started staring at me. I don't know why', and 'I am a free range Ostrich I have you know'. Local resident Colin Grant, 45, said: 'It was dashing around pretty fast - when I first saw it it overtook me and I was doing about 30mph, so it must have been going at 40mph plus. 'It was a very curious sight - it must have escaped from an ostrich farm nearby.' Adult ostriches can run up to 60mph and grow to more than 9ft-tall, and while this youngster (left) is just over 2ft-tall, it can still run at more than 40mph, according to locals (right, file picture) The Tunbridge Wells Ostrich has even gained a following on Twitter . One motorist caught in the queue said: 'There was a queue of about 20 cars pulled over and I assumed it was a lorry coming down. 'I noticed a couple of people getting out of their cars and others leaning out of their windows and taking pictures.' He added: 'Then I saw this young perky ostrich confidently gambolling down the road, with its funny gait. 'It came right up to our window and looked at us but I only managed to get the first shot on my phone.' The police and local council were alerted to the incident. The ostrich is a large flightless bird native to Africa which can ran at speeds of up to 60mph . It is not the first time an exotic animal has been seen on the loose in Britain. In October and November last year wild wallabies were caught in Highgate Cemetery. The first was caught in October by the RSPCA while a second was found two weeks later. It is believed that someone dumped both marsupials in Highgate Woods and that they made their way to the famous cemetery. The ostrich is a large flightless bird native to Africa which can ran at speeds of up to 60mph. The largest living species of bird, they can weigh between 10 and 20 stone and also lay the largest eggs of any living bird. They also have a long lifespan for birds - in captivity, ostriches have lived as long as 62 years and seven months. On the African savanna however they may face a number of predators including lions, leopards and hyenas. But their extraordinary running power means they are often able to outrun most predators, other than the cheetah.","Bird was seen dashing past more than 20 cars at speeds of up to 40mph .

"A Texas school district has banned a football team T-shirt with the slogan 'Shhhhhhh just let it happen' after questions over whether the message could also have a rape innuendo. The issue came up after Arlington Martin High School's bi-monthly newspaper raised concerns about the shirt in a staff editorial. The shirt was designed by senior football team members and printed by the football booster club. It reads 'Martin Football' in big gray letters above an image of a Native American man that represents the school's Warrior mascot. Scroll down for video... Double meaning? An editorial in the school newspaper suggested that the slogan also implied rape rather than just power on the football field . Taking charge: The Warrior Post's editor-in-chief Jerred Osterman, 18, a Martin senior, said that the paper's staff was motivated to write its editorial after a female student had concerns over the T-shirt . Checking it: Osterman said neither he nor his staff questions the motivation of the players or their message of team unity behind the shirt — only the wording of the message and how it might be perceived. To the left of the man is a pirate flag, with a skull and crossbones, along with the words 'We take what we want,' and below the flag is the phrase 'Shhhhhhh just let it happen.' The editorial read: 'The shirt's main message is to state the player's idea that there is no need for the opponent to put up a fight in letting our team take the ball away from them . 'Can this saying be easily misunderstood? Yes. Though it certainly was not the goal of the shirt, its slogan connotes rape culture. This is not what we want to display as a slogan for our Varsity football program,' the editorial reads. The Warrior Post's editor-in-chief Jerred Osterman, 18, a Martin senior, told NBC 5 that the paper's staff was motivated to write its editorial after a female student approached a news staff member with concerns over the T-shirt. Martin coach Bob Wager and booster club president Kevin White said they never considered the message on the shirt to be potentially inappropriate . 'It's inappropriate, and it's not something that you want to represent Martin with,' Osterman said. School sensitivities: How the article appeared in the Warrior Post - the school newspaper . Growing population: 280 children go to school at the Arlington Martin High School in Arlington, Texas . 'It's inappropriate, and it's not something that you want to represent The Martin School with,' Osterman said. The coach of the team, Bob Wager, said that they did not consider the shirt to be inappropriate or offensive in any way adding that they would never have allowed it to be made or worn. He said it referred to 'the act of piracy, taking what you want. What we want is the football'. School district spokeswoman Leslie Johnston said that officials believed the team had not intended to be offensive but that the t-shirts had been banned. 'Certainly the booster club and the coaches, nobody construed it in that manner,' said Leslie Johnston, director of communications for Arlington ISD, who estimates that around 50 of the shirts were printed. 'They were never intended or thought to have any meaning other than a football-related meaning — taking yardage, the ball.' 'They just thought it was a football shirt. And when that was pointed out, that it could be taken in that way the students have, they are no longer wearing them.'","School in Texas has banned students from wearing its football team's t-shirts, following concerns that they promote rape culture .

"Google is expanding its presence in Los Angeles with the $120 million purchase of a dozen acres of vacant land in the Playa Vista area on the city's west side. The parcel is zoned for nearly 900,000 square feet of commercial space that could house offices or studios, the Los Angeles Times reports. The plot is next to a historic hangar where aviator Howard Hughes built his famous 'Spruce Goose' airplane. Google also was expected to lease the hangar, which recently housed soundstages for movie and television, according to the newspaper. Acres: Google is expanding its presence in Los Angeles with the $120 million purchase of a dozen acres of vacant land in the Playa Vista area on the city's west side . Google: The parcel Google purchased is zoned for nearly 900,000 square feet of commercial space that could house offices or studios holding as many as 6,000 workers . City Councilman Mike Bonin, who represents the area, said the purchase 'brands Playa Vista as the tech and innovation capital of Los Angeles.' The Mountain View-based tech giant wouldn't detail its plans for the properties. Last year Microsoft opened a 20,000-square-foot space in Playa Vista, a neighborhood near major freeways, several neighborhoods and Los Angeles International Airport. Facebook has operations nearby, as do other major media companies and ad agencies. Three years ago, Google opened a campus in Venice, where it leased 100,000 square feet in three buildings for about 600 employees. One of those buildings is the famous Binoculars Building, a three-story office on Main Street designed by architect Frank Gehry. 'Spruce Goose':The plot is next to a historic hangar where aviator Howard Hughes built his famous 'Spruce Goose' airplane . A Google spokeswoman said the company, which typically likes to expand near its existing properties, will continue to rent the 69,000-square-foot Binoculars Building. Google views the Playa Vista land purchase as a long-term investment and has no particular design in mind for the site, she told the Times. Google also rents a 41,000-square-foot video production facility for subsidiary YouTube in a renovated former Hughes building in Playa Vista. Google already has bought or rented about 6.2 million square feet of space this year in the San Francisco Bay Area, bringing its total there to 15 million square feet, according to real estate brokerage statistics cited by the Times.","Google purchased 12 acres of land in Los Angeles for $120 million that could hold as many as 6,000 workers .

"Deputy PM Nick Clegg says he is 'delighted' by their arrival . The first giant pandas to arrive in Britain for 17 years touched down at Edinburgh Zoo yesterday after an  11-hour flight from China on a specially-chartered jet. Now, as Sunshine and Sweetie settle into their luxury enclosure and eager fans clamour to see them, hopes are high they could produce the first ever panda cub born on British soil. Here, JOHN NAISH looks at what lies in store for these very special creatures . . . A pair of international celebrities completed their much-anticipated . move to Edinburgh last night, where they are now occupying £275,000 . suites and having their organic food flown in from the Continent. They were met on Scottish soil by photographers, dignitaries and . crowds of flag-waving locals clamouring for a glimpse of them. Earlier . this week, a website selling tickets to see the pair crashed due to the . demand. But, in a departure from the usual celebrity script, the new arrivals are a pair of  giant pandas. Scroll down for video . Safe landing: Chinese panda Yang Guang arrives at Edinburgh Airport yesterday afternoon on a specially chartered flight . Peering out: The panda named Tian Tian is unloaded from a plane at Edinburgh Airport. The pair are the first giant pandas to arrive in the UK for more than 17 years . Sunshine, left, and Sweetie, right, settle in at Edinburgh Zoo. They arrived at the zoo from a conservation centre in Sichuan, China, on a private Boeing 777F flight dubbed the ‘FedEx Panda Express’ Yesterday, female Tian Tian (meaning Sweetie) and male Yang Guang . (Sunshine) arrived in Edinburgh Zoo from a conservation centre in . Sichuan, China, on a private Boeing 777F flight dubbed the ‘FedEx Panda . Express’, along with a vet and two animal handlers. They are on loan from China for the next ten years. Bagpipes played . as the bears were carried carefully from the aircraft in individual . crates, each labelled ‘one panda’ and taken to Edinburgh Zoo. Tian Tian and Yang Guang have been put in enclosures designed by . animal psychologists, which come complete with dens, private pools, a . viewing platform and a room where the pandas will be given health . check-ups. The new arrivals are unloaded from their Panda Express plane following an 11-hour journey from China . New home: Yang Guang is unloaded from the freight aircraft by two FedEx staff members . Welcome: People waited with anticipation to receive Tian Tian and and Yang Guang as their plane touched down . The enclosure also has a specially built ‘love tunnel’ where the two . can meet if they are feeling amorous, and a nursery for any offspring. Zoo bosses believe the pandas will attract more than a million extra . visitors, and a baby panda would see numbers boom even further - . although any cubs would be  the property of China. Already there is eager adulation from the panda-mad public. Earlier . this week, the zoo’s ticket website was unable to cope with the ‘sheer . influx’ of people trying to book tickets and crashed. But then this pair are rare treasures: these are the first pandas in . the UK for 17 years, since London Zoo hosted Bao Bao and Ming Ming in . the early Nineties. And the bears will need to be popular in order to fund their keep. The zoo is paying the Chinese around £636,000 a year for the privilege . of having them. It also needs to buy them £70,000 worth of bamboo a . year. The bears will now have a fortnight to settle in before being put on . show to the public. Although they have come as a pair, they will have . separate rooms as solitary pandas only meet to mate once a year. Excited: A youngster wore a panda hat and joined hundreds of other well-wishers to catch a first sighting of the giant bears at the airport . Their new living quarters are five-star. The animals love to clamber, . so each has a climbing frame that will enable them to see each other . over the tops of their enclosures. The animal psychologists also designed the accommodation to simulate . their natural habitat. Small caves are intended as outdoor bedrooms. There are his ’n’ hers ponds and shaped rocks that act like . panda-recliners, so they can lie back to chew on their bamboo. Alison Maclean, the pandas’ head-keeper, is delighted with the . enclosure’s design. ‘It’s perfect,’ she says. ‘The visitors have huge . viewing panels, both looking into the interior and exterior of the . enclosures. It’s virtually soundproof, so the pandas won’t get . disturbed.’ Pandas spend much of their time munching - as much as 14 hours a day . chewing bamboo. Each year, they will eat up to 18,000kg (over 39,000lb) of the stuff - around 20 three-metre stems a day. This is no ordinary . bamboo, either. Most of it will be imported from a specialist organic . grower on a plantation just outside Amsterdam. After all, you don’t want to let pandas get hungry. They can get very . bearish. In 2009, for example, a giant panda killed eight sheep in a . village near a nature reserve in Leshan in China. First sight: Chinese panda Yang Guang at Edinburgh Airport . Arrival: Giant pandas Tian Tian (Sweetie) and Yang Guang (Sunshine) arrive at Edinburgh Airport on the FedEx Panda Express . Touch down: The FedEx Panda Express lands at Edinburgh Airport . In captivity, they have been known to maul humans. Even when . well-fed, pandas are not completely herbivore. Around one per cent of . their diet is carnivore — popular snacks are rats, mice and insects. The one mod-con the pandas should not need is climate control. The . weather in Edinburgh is very similar to that of their native Sichuan . Province. With all the right conditions, Edinburgh’s zoo keepers hope that the pampered pandas will be in the mood for love. The conservation purpose of their decade-long stay is to produce offspring that can be returned to the wild. Ten years is a significant proportion of a captive panda’s lifespan: . they are normally expected to live for 30 years. Both are now eight. Hopes are high that their stay will prove fruitful: Tian Tian and . Yang Guang have both successfully mated before, but with other partners. While pandas are notoriously difficult to mate in captivity, Tian Tian . and Yang Guang are said to stand a better chance than most of producing . young. The ‘boisterous’ male, Yang Guang, is said to be better endowed . than the average panda. He has already sired a string of cubs in the . Ya’an reserve in China, where both pandas were born and raised. And although Tian Tian, has been described as ‘a very quiet and nervous character’, she has given birth to two cubs. Through the keyhole: Yang Guang is seen eating bamboo branches through a whole of the FedEx container transporting the pair to Edinburgh . Nervous flyer? Yang Guang is fed with apples in the minutes before being loaded onto the plane to Scotland . Heavy load: Giant panda Yang Guang is hauled onto the plane at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, ready for his trip to Scotland . Special delivery: The FedEx Panda Express has special livery for the flight . Hugh Roberts, chief executive of the Scottish zoological society, . said he was ‘very confident’ the pandas would become the first in . Britain to breed naturally. ‘They both know what to do and that’s a . start,’ he said. ‘I don’t think Yang Guang’s sexual prowess is in . doubt.’ Nevertheless, the last British attempt ended in an acrimonious . divorce: London Zoo’s Bao Bao and Ming Ming fought savagely and had to . be separated. Bao Bao was sent to Berlin Zoo in 1993 and Ming Ming . returned to China in 1994. Their predecessors had fared little better. In 1974, the Conservative . prime minister, Edward Heath, attempted to lighten the gloom of a . Britain struck by economic crisis by bringing over Chia-Chia and . Ching-Ching, in what was considered a coup of ‘panda diplomacy’ with the . Communist regime. But although the pair were loved by visitors to London Zoo, they didn’t seem to love each other, and were cubless to the end. Loaded up: Tian Tian sat peacefully in a cage, before being taken to the airport . Pandas’ problems are exacerbated by the female’s very short period of . fertility. Jennifer Butler, a spokeswoman for Edinburgh zoo, says: . ‘They only have a period of three days a year when the female is . receptive. Within this, there is only a window of between 24 and 48 . hours when she is fertile.’ Worse still, male pandas can prove lackadaisical. In 2007, keepers at . Northern Thailand’s Chiang Mai Zoo resorted to sitting a male called . Chuang Chuang in front of a TV showing raunchy videos of bears mating in . an attempt to spark his interest. The chief veterinarian, Kanika . Limtrakul, was disappointed to admit ‘Chuang Chuang seemed indifferent’ to the films. If Edinburgh does hit the panda cub jackpot, then it would prove a . welcome boost to conservation efforts: there are as few as 1,600 giant . pandas in central China. Farewell party: A Chinese woman sees off the pandas, who will have an extended stay in Edinburgh . Fragile cargo: The bears are loaded into special crates before boarding a plane heading for Edinburgh . Not everyone is a supporter, however. Chris Packham, the BBC wildlife . presenter, has said pandas should be allowed to die out and the money . spent on conserving them should go on other species. His words outraged . the Chinese and threatened the loan deal for Tian Tian and Yang Guang. But if a rare cub is produced, Edinburgh can expect an unprecedented . frenzy because there is something about these creatures that pulls the . heart strings. For example, a video on YouTube entitled Baby Panda . Sneezing has been viewed 190 million times. If such an adorable creature were to be born in Edinburgh, the . visitor bonus to the nation would certainly not be worth sneezing at.

"Most 19-year-old boys can only dream of living a billionaire’s lifestyle of fast cars, superyachts, luxury mansions and parties with the stars. But for tycoon’s son Rufus Caudwell, it is a nightmare that has left him housebound for years with agoraphobia. Rufus – the son of Phones 4u founder John Caudwell – may have developed the anxiety disorder as a result of his parents’ divorce and the pressure of living in the shadow of his phenomenally successful father. Scroll down for video . Billionaire businessman John Cauldwell, left and his son Rufus, right, who suffers from agoraphobia . He has lived with its crippling effects since 2006, when Mr Caudwell made his fortune by selling his mobile phone empire for £1.5billion. The business made headlines earlier this week after it was forced into administration. Rufus claims that despite being treated by experts and psychiatrists, he may never be cured so he can enjoy his father’s lifestyle. The teenager is appearing on a television show to explain how his life has been affected by his father’s immense wealth – and by his own illness. Speaking on Jon Richardson Grows Up on Channel 4 with his sister Libby about the luxury and opportunity Mr Caudwell’s success offers, he said: ‘We will never quite live up to dad, whatever we do. We will never quite get there. ‘We almost feel guilty that we have this. You think, “What have I done? Why do I deserve this?”. It is the luck of the draw. I just happened to be born from a certain set of parents.’ Similar concerns caused Libby, 26, to ask her 61-year-old father to cut off her allowance two years ago. John Caudwell, with his girlfriend Claire Johnson . Mr Caudwell separated from Rufus’s mother Kathryn in 2001 after nearly three decades of marriage. They had three children – Rufus, Libby and their sister Rebekah. The tycoon lives with his partner Claire Johnson and their young son Jacobi in a Grade I-listed mansion in Staffordshire and a five-storey mansion in London’s Mayfair. He often entertains his celebrity friends and supporters of his charity for disabled youngsters, Caudwell Children, such as the Duchess of York, Rod Stewart, Robbie Williams, Joan Collins, Sir Bruce Forsyth, Elizabeth Hurley, Peter Andre and Boris Becker. But Mr Caudwell’s star-studded lifestyle clearly intimidates Rufus. He tells comedian Richardson: ‘I can’t quite understand the life my father leads because it is so glamorous. I just sit there on Facebook in my bedroom. He is desperate for me to live this life with him and it is incredibly frustrating for him.’ Libby adds: ‘The stuff dad does! There are ski chalets and boats. Dad has got an unbelievable life and Rufus has not been to any of it.’ Agoraphobia, which affects up to 450,000 Britons, makes sufferers feel extreme anxiety in situations others take for granted, such as leaving the house or taking public transport. It is often brought on by a traumatic experience. Professor Kevin Gournay, from the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London, and the Priory Hospital, said youngsters can be affected if their parents separate or a parent is a high-flier – both of which apply to Rufus. Professor Gournay added: ‘The stresses of divorce could trigger agoraphobia. It’s fair to say the children of parents who are in the limelight – high achievers – are often under terrific pressure to emulate their parents. That can lead to anxiety, which can lead to agoraphobia.’ For Rufus, it means days spent alone in his bedroom playing video games or using social media. Revealing how his life has been affected, he said: ‘I suffer from – and I have done for about eight or nine years – agoraphobia. Which is basically a phobia of leaving the house. That has been the biggest part of my life. At the moment it is an achievement if I can go four minutes in the car out of the house. ‘A normal day, depressingly, is devoid of much purpose. I just wake up when I want to. I will lie in bed for an hour, maybe get up and play some Xbox. There have been times when I have not been able to leave my bedroom. For the past eight years on and off that has pretty much been my life. ‘For once in his life [my father] can’t really make an impact. I have had numerous therapists, but I don’t think anyone can cure me. It is all down to me.’","Rufus Caudwell, son of billionaire businessman John has agoraphobia .

"Mr O'Leary insisted the erotic movies would be visible only on personal devices, rather than screened on the back of Ryanair plane seats . The boss of budget airline Ryanair wants to launch a pay-per-view pornography service for passengers to watch during flights, it has been claimed. Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said he hopes to launch an app for the airline where travellers can watch sex scenes on their iPads or smartphones while in the air. The planned service would also allow Ryanair passengers to gamble and play games, as well as watch erotic movies, according to The Sun. Mr O'Leary told the paper: 'I'm not talking about having it on screens on the back of seats for everyone to see. It would be on handheld devices. 'Hotels around the world have it, so why wouldn't we?' But the move raises the prospect of passengers watching porn films with children sitting barely feet away. Ryanair said the pornography plans would take at least a year to introduce on their flights, as establishing a cost-effective way of having a solid broadband connection on their planes would be a major obstacle. It is not the first controversial proposal for the airline from its outspoken chief executive. Last month he said he was looking at removing all but one toilet from his planes to put in extra seats. While he has previously proposed charging passengers for using the toilet in-flight. The latest brainwave from the budget airline boss was revealed as Ryanair bucked airline industry gloom by raising its full-year net profit forecasts by 10 per cent to £377m. The airline, which carried 75m passengers last year, raised its guidance despite a 37 per cent surge in jet fuel prices to £778m during the first six months of the year.

"Per Mertesacker hailed an important response to Tuesday night's results after Arsenal's late winner against Southampton. Alexis Sanchez's 89th-minute goal saw off the 10-man Saints - depleted by Toby Alderweireld's injury after they had used all of their substitutes - and kept Arsenal in touch with the Premier League's top four.

'They were unlucky, they were one man down because of an injured player, but we deserved it because we kept going.' The win was Arsenal's third in succession, following those against Borussia Dortmund and West Brom, and their German defender said: 'We want to continue that run and be more consistent, especially in the Christmas period. We have potential, everyone knows, but we have to show it.' Southampton manager Ronald Koeman believed Alderweireld's injury left his side struggling at the crucial moment. The win was Arsenal's third in a row after beating Borussia Dortmund and West Brom recently . Sanchez celebrates giving Arsenal an 89th-minute lead against Southampton on Wednesday night . 'If you lose a match in the last few minutes, it's always frustrating,' he said. 'It was a good reaction after last Saturday (losing 3-0 to Manchester City), we had our chances but we were a bit unlucky with the injuries. 'After the third change, Alderweireld had a hamstring injury and then it was 11 against 10, and that made the difference. 'It's no points today but if we keep playing this way, no problem.' Goalkeeper Fraser Forster had kept Southampton on level terms with excellent saves from Danny Welbeck and substitute Olivier Giroud in the second half.

"Where the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson, Terry Venables and Alan Pardew have failed, Sam Allardyce has succeeded. It’s hard to believe Teddy Sheringham has spent the past six years out of the game. But here he is back at West Ham United, wrapped up to the nines in his training gear after leading a coaching session at chilly Chadwell Heath. The former England striker is back in football. Not that he looks like he has ever been away. Teddy Sheringham reveals why he decided to take time away from football following his retirement . TEDDY on... BIG SAM . I couldn’t have asked to work with a better boss for my first real impression of what managerial life is like. He’s been very open with me and I’ve got the utmost respect for that. He’s very experienced. TEDDY on... CARROLL . It’s not now or never for Andy. He’s getting there and he’s a still very young man in footballing terms. He has surprised me in how good his finishing is. But he’s got to take that on to the pitch. With a cool head, he’ll get goals. TEDDY on... DOWNING . I’ve loved working with him. I can’t believe he only had one goal last year and one the previous season. He’s an outstanding talent... phenomenal. He’s got every finish in the book, so he should be scoring goals. Sheringham still looks as fit and sharp as he did throughout the golden years of a career in which he played until 40, a record age for an outfield Premier League player. West Ham fans drool at the way Sheringham zips the ball around during pre-match warm-ups. Up in the stands the talk turns to whether he could still do a job on the pitch. So what has kept Sheringham away so long? ‘It’s all about timing,’ he says. ‘I saw Alan [Pardew] out in Germany last summer - West Ham and Newcastle crossed paths as we were in the same tournament - and he was like, “What are you doing here?” So I said, “I don’t know, what am I doing here?” ‘Quite a few managers have tried to get me on that path of taking my badges and doing coaching. Terry Venables always told me that I need to be involved, not just for myself but for football. Sir Alex always said to me “get your badges done because you’ll love it”. 'It was the same with Pards when he came to West Ham. My view was that I was either a player or a coach or a manager. It’s black or white for me. But the gaffer’s call in the summer was just perfect timing and the scenario was, too — on a part-time basis.’ Sheringham claims the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson and Terry Venables tried to get him into coaching . The 48-year-old chats with Sportsmail's Matt Lawless at West Ham's Chadwell Heath training ground . Sheringham spends two days a week working with West Ham, three if there is a home match. And having just returned from a sun-kissed week in Dubai, it’s an arrangement that suits him to a tee. Despite their defeat by Everton last weekend, West Ham have started this season with a bang. They have scored twice as many goals (20) as they managed last season in the opening 12 games and sit just one point below the top four. Survival is no longer up for discussion. The talk is of Europe as they eye the ultimate send-off before moving to the Olympic Stadium. Sheringham, 48, who had three years as a player at West Ham, refuses to take the credit, but ultimately he wants to be the man calling the shots at the top. ‘I’m loving it. Really loving it,’ he says. ‘It has been very different. I’m on the other side of the fence and it’s a big change. The situation with myself and Sam was: “Look come in two days a week and see what happens and if you don’t like it, we’ll part our ways”. Sheringham had spells at many clubs  including Nottingham Forest (left) Portsmouth (centre) and Colchester . Sheringham spent three years as a player at West Ham between 2004 and 2007 . The former frontman revealedTerry Venables (right) encouraged him to take his coaching badges . Former West Ham boss Alan Pardew (centre) also believed Sheringham should go into management . ‘But if I’m going to do it, I want to be the best I can. I’m an all or nothing type of bloke. And I hope that will take me into management. That’s the way I’m feeling. I want to go full steam ahead. ‘I’m a coach at the moment but I’d like to be a manager.’ So how has he it found it working with the likes of Andy Carroll, Stewart Downing and Enner Valencia? ‘The players have been very good towards me,’ says Sheringham. ‘I’ve played here, been around the place before and scored goals. But it’s a little bit different trying to explain that to other people. Sheringham has been putting on training sessions for the likes of Andy Carroll (left) and Diafra Sakho . The former England international believes it's 'now or never' for Hammers frontman Carroll . Hammers boss Sam Allardyce called Sheringham in the summer to ask if he would return as a coach . ‘It’s about getting to know those players. It’s not just about putting on a session. It’s about talking to the players and finding out where they are - discover their mindset - because that’s crucial. I was a little bit apprehensive about coming in and putting on my first session because I don’t know how it’s going to go. ‘They’re looking at me and probably thinking, you’re this ex-player who’s been around and knows his stuff. Well, go on then... show us what you can do. And it’s a bit like, well I’ve never put on a session before! West Ham are currently sixth in the Premier League table with 18 points from 12 games . Sheringham believes West Ham winger Stewart Downing is an 'outstanding talent' ‘It’s a little bit of trial and error. If you put on two or three bad sessions, they’ll soon be saying, “No thanks. I’ll go and do my shooting with someone else”. Touch wood, it has not been like that.’ Sheringham draws on the experiences of playing under George Graham, Brian Clough, Venables, Ferguson, Glenn Hoddle and Harry Redknapp. ‘Cloughie and Fergie were great, but didn’t really coach much. But then there’s George Graham. At Millwall, he would put on a shooting session and show us exactly what he wanted. ‘It was unbelievable at the time for a 19-year-old boy. I was like “Oh, wow”. Shooting, heading, volleying. He was fantastic. And you’d think, “Right, so that’s what you want me to do,” and you’d try and emulate it. Sheringham believes Sir Alex Ferguson was the manager he played under, but 'didn't really coach much' Sheringham believes the way some Newcastle fans treated Pardew was 'disgusting' ‘I’ve tried to take some of that experience into it. ‘I was lucky to have so many great coaches, great managers that I worked under and at the right stage of my career as well. ‘You try and think about what would they have said to me at that particular time - what would he have done. But I’ve had a few bad ones along the way too. I’ve seen first-hand the wrong way to do things. You can’t have it all good. Despite fans calling for him to be sacked, Pardew's side are now on a run of six successive victories . Roberto Martinez (left) and Allardyce patrol the touchline during Everton's win against West Ham . Sheringham admits that he will have to be thick-skinned if he is to take up a management role . Andy Carroll is on the cover of West Ham's programme for Saturday's game with Newcastle . ‘And this is the thing with the boys at Manchester United. They worked under Sir Alex Ferguson and that’s all they know. ‘He was the best, without a doubt, as a manager. But they’ve not sampled the bad managers. They’ve not sampled the ups and downs. I’ve been in and around pretty much every scenario in football.’ Pardew’s Newcastle visit West Ham on Saturday looking for their seventh straight win — all on the back of heavy criticism from supporters who campaigned for him to be sacked. ‘Some of it was disgusting,’ says Sheringham. ‘You wouldn’t wish it upon your worst enemy. ‘It was the same for Sam with some of the stick that he’s taken. But they are thick-skinned these managers. You look at them and think, “How are you taking that?” In no other job in the world would you get people barracking in your ear. 'They’ll be trying to concentrate on the pitch but all they can hear is thousands of people all around screaming, “You’re useless”. How does that work? So you have to take your hat off and applaud them for doing a good job.’ One day people may applaud Sheringham, the manager, for doing a good job too. The full interview with Teddy Sheringham appears in the Official West Ham United programme for the game against Newcastle. Also inside, Andy Carroll talks about how he has changed his lifestyle and Les Ferdinand looks back on his career with both clubs.

"He’s the 7-foot son of a Melbourne car mechanic who made it big in the US after he became the first Australian player to be drafted number one overall in the NBA. His skills on the court have not only landed the 30-year-old a place on Californian basketball team the Golden State Warriors but a $14 million-a-year salary to play with. So what does Andrew Bogut spend his cash on? Australian basketball star Andrew Bogut plays for Californian team the Golden State Warriors . Bogut, who was born to Croatian immigrants Mišo and Ankica and grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Endeavour Hills, now lives in a luxurious home in Walnut Creek, California, which he paid for straight-up. He told sport’s website ESPN his most expensive habit is his passion for muscle cars. Bogut said his most prized possession is his '69 Ford Mustang Boss 429, as part of his huge car collection that includes ‘about six in the States, about 10 in Australia’. ‘They're older, muscle, antique-type cars. I don't buy new Bentleys and that kind of c**p,’ he told ESPN. 'Good to come home from the road trip to this,' Bogut said of his vintage Camaro car . Andrew Bogut wrote on Twitter: 'Good to have #blackfalcon over for some billards. Notice how many of @hbarnes stripes are left on the table?  #ouch'. He bought the table for $225 . He claims to spend roughly $2,000 a week on expenses such as food and drink, transport and shopping – including feeding his two Siberian husky dogs. In October, he had a new $225 billiard table installed in his house and told ESPN: ‘The table weighs like 600 pounds­ - it took two or three guys to take it out of storage and put it together in the living room. I'll happily cough up the cash instead of hurting my back.’ Bogut grew up in Melbourne playing AFL and tennis in addition to basketball. One of Bogut's two Siberian husky dogs that he lives with in California . Bogut has his very own pinball machine at home in the house he paid for in cash . At 15-years-old he was cut from the Victoria junior state representative team but he did not give up on his dreams and later went on to attend the Australian Institute of Sport. He  led the Australian team that won the 2003 FIBA Junior World Championships before moving to Salt Lake City in Utah to play college basketball in the States, going on to begin his successful and lucrative NBA career. Last year, Bogut revealed how he finds it hard to let new people close to him because he worries about their possible ulterior motives. 'Unpacking some boxes and came across some old photos! My very first car! #Lplates #VRBerlina,' Bogut wrote on Twitter . 'Glad I got these babies through customs coming back from China! #childhooddream,' he wrote alongside a photo of some nunchucks . He told the Herald Sun: 'The last thing I want to do is lose all my money, everything I worked hard for. 'Unfortunately for me there is more bad because what I make is public and, where money is involved, the bad people come out. 'Everyone knows what I earn, so everyone sees me as a walking dollar sign.' Back home in Australia, Bogut has used some of his earnings to develop a basketball academy in his Carrum Downs, Melbourne. The Andrew Bogut Basketball Academy, which opened in 2011, is open to Juniors currently playing representative basketball from Under 12 to Under 20 age groups.

"The will of legendary director Mike Nichols was filed in Manhattan Surrogate’s Court Wednesday. Nichols, who passed away last month at the age of 83 from cardiac arrest, left his $20million fortune to his wife, newscaster Diane Sawyer, and three children, Max, Daisy and Jenny Nichols. Beyond that, only a few specific gifts were detailed. Scroll down for video . Final will : Mike Nichols (above with wife Diane Sawyer, son max and daughter Jenny) will was filed on Wednesday, with his $20m fortune going to wife Diane and his children Daisy, Jenny and Max . In charge: Nichols' wife Diane Sawyer was also named the executor of his will . According to Page Six, 'a J.F. Herring painting will go to his son Max Nichols and his wife will get all his tangible property including furnishings, automobiles and clothing.' The will was signed last May, and Nichols appointed Sawyer as the executor. Sawyer will also likely continue to live at their penthouse on New York City's tony Fifth Avenue and keep their vacation home on Martha's Vineyard. Nichols had a long and illustrious career in show business, getting his start as a comedy duo with Elaine May before going on to become one of the greatest directors of all time. He is one of just a few people to have collected a Grammy, Emmy, Tony and Oscar, for works including the film The Graduate, the play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and the television special Angels in America. Art: Nichols' son Max (above) will also receive a J.F. Herring painting . At the time of his death he was preparing to direct Meryl Streep as Maria Callas in a film version of Master Class for HBO. Streep, a longtime friend, had worked with Nichols on Silkwood, Heartburn, Angels in America and Postcards From the Edge. She was just one of the many actors who came to remember him following his passing, a sign of the special bond he shared with those he worked with over the years. Said Streep of Nichols, 'An inspiration and joy to know, a director who cried when he laughed, a friend without whom, well, we can't imagine our world, an indelible irreplaceable man.'","The will of Mike Nichols was filed in a Manhattan court on Wednesday .

"For months its brutality has been documented in propaganda designed to frighten the world into considering its terrorist cause. But footage of life under the rule of ISIS has revealed the lasting effects of the group's barbarity, with women and children strolling past the decapitated bodies of Syrian soldiers in the city of Raqqa without giving them a second glance. Unaffected by the sight of the decaying corpses, civilians do not even acknowledge the men's impaled heads positioned on fences across the city which has become a recruiting hub for extremists. Scroll down for video . Another day of terror at the hands of ISIS: Civilians walk past bodies lying across the pavements in Raqqa seemingly unaffected by the horrors being carried out . The decapitated bodies of Syrian soldiers were left scattered in the streets of Raqqa by ISIS fighters . Heads impaled on spikes look down on the city's pavements in a constant reminder of the group's barbarity . It is among the most gruesome hallmarks of life under the group's control since jihadis stormed President Assad's army and took hold earlier this year. The video, filmed in July, offers a rare glimpse into civilian life since ISIS launched a campaign of terror against Syria and Iraq. Scattered corpses lie on pavements and roads with some tied to fencing, their severed heads stuck between their legs, as black-clad ISIS fighters patrol the streets. In other parts of the town preachers urge children, with black balaclavas disguising their innocent faces, to disobey their parents and join the militant group. 'I swear to god we will see a caliphate based on the prophecy. Be with the state or you will be the ones who get killed,' a man threatened one group of silent youngsters to a backdrop of the group's ominous flag. While the corpses of President Assad's troops will be removed within three days, the threat of death is enduring for everyone else, one civilian revealed. 'They hate to see the murder but they cannot speak because of fear,' one civilian living in the city told MailOnline. Soldiers decapitated bodies were tied to fences with their trousers around their knees in the horrifying images . The corpses were removed within three days though it is not known where they were taken, a civilian revealed . By-passers do not raise an eyebrow at the horrific scenes with ISIS fighters patrolling the city's streets . As American and Arab forces continue to bomb ISIS strongholds across Syria and Kurdish forces sustain a ferocious defence of the Turkish border, Raqqa remains under the sinister rule of extremists. Among the most prolific images of terrorist fighters are those taken in the city which has been rendered a 'ghost town' by fanatics patrolling the streets in black uniforms and balaclavas. Footage of young soldiers brandishing machine guns and walking in single file emerged online as early as January this year, while the civilian website Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently offers a backlog of the atrocities residents have been subjected to. Just this month a 17-year-old was crucified in the town's centre, alleged to have taken photographs of jihadis in action. Several weeks ago photographs emerged of ISIS fighters splashing around in hotel swimming pools and dining in expensive restaurants while the town's hospitals shut down and children were banished to training camps. Meanwhile residents home have been ravaged by what effects the airstrikes have had on the area. 'Our city will be destroyed, we will pay with our blood,' one resident said, adding: 'It will be a very big war, and in big wars, the civilian will pay.' Of the cameraman who captured the disturbing images, he said: 'It is possible the Daash (ISIS) (will) kill him on this.' Earlier this month another civilian revealed how extremists were living like royalty in the town while ordinary residents plunged further into poverty. Using a pseudonym he revealed how jihadis had taken control of the town's food supplies and marched through its mostly deserted streets waving the group's flag. Since the haunting footage was taken in summer, insiders say the city has quietened with the fear of airstrikes at the hands of American and Arab forces imminent. Once heaving with rows of ISIS soldiers, a member of the group, Raqqa Is Being Silently Slaughtered, likened its streets to a ghost town in a recent online post. American and Arab forces have launched a series of airstrikes on areas they consider ISIS strongholds including the border town of Kobane, where Kurdish fighters continue to wage bloody warfare on the group. A picture taken in June shows an ISIS fighter jubilantly brandishing the terror group's flags through the deserted streets of Raqqa . Young soldiers in balaclavas and black uniforms patrol the streets of Raqqa with  guns earlier this year . Life has become easier for fighters in Raqqa under Islamic State rule, with jihadists rewarded with higher salaries and bonuses while civilians plunge further into poverty . Dozens have been buried in the Turkish town of Suruc as the battle for Kobane, once considered an ISIS stronghold, rages on. At the beginning of the month jihadis approached the town from the desert, planting their flag on Tilsehir hill. Yesterday, after weeks of bloody conflict and devastating air strikes, it was replaced by a yellow Kurdish flag in one of the first signs of hope for fighters defending the border. But with so many refugees having fled the grasp of fanatics in recent months, dozens have died alone with no traces of family available to their comrades. An estimated 1.6million refugees have crossed the border into Turkey since fanatics took hold of more towns earlier this year. Tilsehir Hill, where the black flag of ISIS stood triumphantly for weeks, was obliterated by an American-Arab airstrike earlier this week .

How can he get Danny Welbeck to improve after missing a host of chances against Saints? How much longer can he rely on Alexis Sanchez to get Arsenal out of jail? Should he get Thierry Henry at the club as a coach, passing on his expertise, as soon as possible? Everyone, it seemed, had forgotten about one of the World Cup winners missing from Arsenal's ranks.

"Manuel Pellegrini has fired a warning to Premier League leaders Chelsea by declaring that his champions are back to their title-winning best. Manchester City were impressive 4-1 winners at Sunderland last night with Sergio Aguero (two), Steven Jovetic and father-to-be Pablo Zabaleta on target. They fell behind to Connor Wickham’s 19th-minute effort on the ground where they have been beaten 1-0 on their last four visits. VIDEO Scroll down for Manuel Pellegrini: We are returning to our form from last season . Sergio Aguero drives home Manchester City's first goal to equalise at the Stadium of Light in their 4-1 win . Pellegrini returns the ball to the pitch as his City side, he says, returned to the form that won last year's title . But Aguero soon drew them level before teeing up Jovetic for a second. Zabaleta – who married fiancée Christel during the summer - celebrated news of her pregnancy with a classy third after the break and Aguero then stole in for his 19th of the season. It keeps the gap to Chelsea – 3-0 winners over Spurs – at six points. Pellegrini said: 'I think we are returning to the performances we had last season. I think if we continue playing this way of course we will fight for the title, but I think three or four other teams will also be there.' Another masterful performance from Aguero drew qualified praise from Pellegrini, who was keen to stress the team effort which enabled his side to end their run of four consecutive 1-0 defeats at the Stadium of Light. Stevan Jovetic makes it 2-1 as his shot ends almost directly behind 6ft 8in keeper Costel Pantilimon . Aguero (left) and Jovetic (right) after the former set up the latter for their second goal of the match . Pellegrini said: 'He is an important player but it is not just Sergio Aguero - we play in a way that it is very useful for him to score but it is important for him not just to think about scoring but to play for the team. 'There are a lot of good strikers but I said before the last game that I am sure he is one of the best five players in the world because he is not just scoring, he is playing very well.' Meanwhile Pellegrini had encouraging news on captain Vincent Kompany, who has been ruled out for at least a week with a hamstring injury and is in a race against time to be fit for the crucial UEFA Champions League clash with Roma next Wednesday. Pellegrini added: 'Vincent is improving and maybe it is not such a serious injury as we thought at the beginning - but he needs to see the whole week and we will see what happens with him.' Manuel Pellegrini warmly greets Aguero as his star striker is replaced in the 74th minute . Pablo Zabaleta celebrates his second half goal, City's third, with a gesture to his pregnant wife Christel . Sunderland boss Gus Poyet admitted his side could have no complaints about the manner of City's victory but rued his side's inability to hold on to their early lead for more than two minutes. Poyet said: 'Sergio is unique and at this moment in time he is one of the top three on-form strikers. He has performed week in, week out whether it is against us or Bayern Munich and it shows. 'I can't have too many complaints - they were better than us in every aspect of the game. We started well and had a chance before we scored our goal, but then Aguero appears from nowhere and does something special.' Connor Wickham opens the scoring for Sunder but that's where the good news ended for the hosts . Poyet admitted his side's gruelling fixture schedule told against City, coming so soon after a gutsy goalless draw against Chelsea at the weekend. He added: 'It's hard on us to play these two games consecutively and the physical demands were a lot. 'We thought before the game we would be on the same level and we would be able to compete - but we were not.'","Manchester City beat Sunderland 4-1 at the Stadium of Light .

"The Baltimore Ravens say they didn't write a script for Ray Rice and Janay Rice during their joint news conference on May 23. In an interview this week on the 'Today' show, Janay Rice said the team suggested to her that she apologize for her involvement in the February incident in which Ray punched her in an elevator. Janay Rice also said the Ravens gave the couple 'a general script' for the news conference. Janay Rice told Today: 'I was ready to do anything that was going to help the situation. Help the way we looked in the media, help his image, help obviously his career. They told us earlier that week we would do the press conference, and I was fine with it.' Denial: Despite what Janay Rice told Today, the Baltimore Ravens deny they ever asked her to apologize during her joint news conference with abusive husband Ray Rice in May . 'I was basically ... not doing what I was told, but at the same time, I didn't think it was completely wrong for me to apologize because at the end of the day, I got arrested, too. So I did something wrong, too. Not taking any light off of what Ray did because I agree with everybody else. It was wrong.' Kevin Byrne, Senior Vice President of Public and Community Relations for the Ravens, said in a statement Wednesday that the team provided talking points to Ray, but not Janay. 'At no time prior to the May 23 session did we provide talking points, a script or suggested script to Janay or speak with her about the press event,' Byrne wrote. 'We did not recommend or suggest to Ray or Janay that she apologize in any way.' After Ray Rice told the Ravens he wanted Janay to speak to the media at the news conference, Byrne said he asked the running back 'on two different days if Ray wanted me to speak with Janay in advance of the press session. Both times, Ray declined and said: 'She's good. She knows what she wants to say.' Janay Rice told Today that the Baltimore Ravens gave both her and Ray Rice a script and told her to apologize at their joint press conference . Meanwhile, Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive vice president for football operations, conceded that the case involving Ray Rice was handled poorly. 'The commissioner (Roger Goodell) has acknowledged those mistakes,' Vincent told a packed hearing by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. 'We failed. This is all part of our evaluation as we look at a new personal conduct policy ... But we learned from those mistakes.' Representatives of the four major U.S. sports were on hand at the hearing on domestic abuse although none of the commissioners were present and only one of the top players' union officials, Michele Roberts of the National Basketball Association. Domestic abuse has been a flashpoint issue ever since the NFL's handling of the Rice case, in which Goodell suspended the former Baltimore Ravens running back for twogames for knocking out his fiancée, who later became his wife. Only when graphic video emerged showing him knocking out his then-fiancee did the Ravens release him and the NFL suspend him indefinitely. Repealing the NFL's tax-exempt status and favorable anti-trust position was discussed by the senators should the league fail to implement an effective domestic abuse policy. Kevin Byrne, Senior Vice President of Public and Community Relations for the Ravens, said in a statement Wednesday that the team provided talking points to Ray, but not Janay . 'When young people see athletes committing acts of violence, and when those acts are excused, glossed over, and given pathetically weak punishments, they learn that domestic violence is not taken seriously,' said Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal. Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, said he knew of six NBA players who were charged with domestic violence recently but not sanctioned by the league because there were no convictions. 'The Commissioner (Adam Silver) has acknowledged that we need to do more in this issue in terms of discipline going forward,' said Kathleen Behrens, the NBA's executive vice president for social responsibility. 'Mostly in terms of due process and not really relying on the criminal justice system,' she added. Vincent, who played in the NFL for 15 years, broke down when discussing his childhood. 'Domestic violence was a way of life in my home growing up,' he said. 'My brother and I watched helplessly numerous times as my mother was beaten and knocked unconscious while we dialed 911.' 'We saw how she struggled to seek help and find the courage to say 'no more'.'

"Arsene Wenger praised the fighting spirit of Alexis Sanchez after the Chile striker fired Arsenal to a 1-0 Barclays Premier League victory over Southampton at the Emirates Stadium. Sanchez pounced in the 89th minute for his 14th goal in 22 appearances since his summer arrival from Barcelona as the Gunners narrowed the gap on the top four to two points. 'Alexis is one of the players who had to dig deep, but he still had such desire to fight. He always finds something special to get a goal,' Arsenal boss Wenger said. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsene Wenger: Sanchez finds something special to get a goal . Alexis Sanchez shows his delight after his 10th Premier League goal of the season against Southampton . Sanchez tapped home from close range in the 89th minute to snatch maximum points for Arsenal . 'It's difficult to find examples of someone who has settled at a club so quickly. He arrived in July and now it's December. 'When you look at the number of goals he has and the impact he has on the team, it's fabulous.' Arsenal benefited from the 65th-minute arrival of Olivier Giroud, whose physical presence made the difference when Saints had been reduced to 10 men after Toby Alderweireld limped off with a hamstring injury. Alderweireld's exit came after Saints had used their three permitted substitutes. Arsenal players gather around 'fighter' Sanchez (second right) after his dramatic late winner . 'Olivier's physical presence made a difference,' Wenger said. Arsenal's hopes of exposing Southampton as top-four imposters looked destined to be dashed by a goalless draw until Sanchez's late intervention and Wenger was relieved to be able to reflect on a third successive victory. 'We deserved that because we gave very few chances away and had more chances than Southampton and because we kept a clean sheet,' Wenger said. 'It was a bit hard to get going at the start because we'd given a lot against Dortmund and West Brom. This was our third game in (eight) days. Arsene Wenger hails the 'fight' in Sanchez but says it was Olivier Giroud's physical presence that made a significant difference when he came off the bench . Wenger admitted he felt the Emirates crowd getting nervous after they lost their last match at home . 'We had to dig deep against a good team that is very well organised. We had to be patient and wait for our chances. 'We have the right attitude and a good solidarity in the team, a good focus, and that's a good basis for us. 'It was important to win because we lost our last home game and you could see the crowd was nervous.' Southampton manager Ronald Koeman admitted the departure of Alderweireld with six minutes to go encouraged Arsenal to pour forward in search of the winner. 'For the first hour we were outstanding and our team gave a very good reaction after the loss last Sunday,' Koeman said. Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster looks on in despair as he is finally beaten in an outstanding display . Ronald Koeman was pleased with his side's first hour coming off a heavy defeat by Manchester City . VIDEO Koeman unhappy with second half performance . 'We were unlucky with the injuries and that gave Arsenal the motivation to bring more in the last 10 minutes, pressing with 11 players against 10 players. 'Toby couldn't play on. If it's a kick on the ankle you can ask them to play on, but it was a hamstring problem. You can't continue with a hamstring injury. 'Our goalkeeper Fraser Forster was outstanding but it wasn't enough to keep a clean sheet.' Jack Cork and Dusan Tadic also suffered respective ankle and groin injuries.","Alexis Sanchez scored in the 89th minute to snatch victory for Arsenal .

"After weeks of hard work organising the Invictus Games, Prince Harry finally got to celebrate his 30th birthday last night with a black tie event at Clarence House. The royal has been too busy making sure his pet project went off without a hitch in recent weeks to properly mark the milestone date. But he enjoyed a party befitting a prince at the royal residence opposite Buckingham Palace last night - with a special performance from singer Ellie Goulding. His brother Prince William joined the celebration but Harry's pregnant sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, who has been suffering from severe ante-natal sickness, had to stay away. Scroll down for video . Prince Harry, left, celebrated his 30th birthday with a black-tie event featuring Ellie Goulding, right . Guests arrive at Clarence House last night for a black-tie party to celebrate Prince Harry's 30th birthday . Security was tight for the party, with policemen checking in guests wearing formal evening dress . Police protecting the gates wave through a Land Rover as the Prince's friends arrive for the event last night . With his father, Prince Charles, and step-mother, the Duchess of Cornwall, on holiday in Scotland, the party-loving prince was given the run of their London residence. The birthday boy drove himself in through the rear entrance to the house at 7.20pm with his protection officer by his side in the top-of-the-range Audi. But it was unlikely, given Harry’s fondness for a good time, that he would be driving himself home to Kensington Palace again. His brother, Prince William, arrived shortly afterwards, also driving himself in a brand new Range Rover. Most of Harry’s guests drove up through the gates in their car, pressing a printed invitation with a cypher on the top up against the window to a waiting police office for identification. Several arrived by foot, however, wearing a mixture of suits and tuxedos and evening dresses. Singer Ellie Goulding - who performed at William and Kate’s wedding reception - was said to have played at the bash. Guests arrive at Clarence House, which Prince Charles allowed Harry to use while he is away in Scotland . A guest shows their much sought-after invitation to a policeman at the back gates of Clarence House last night . The party was a welcome break for Harry, who has been busy organising the Invictus Games this month . The Prince of Wales allowed Prince Harry to use Clarence House to host the formal event last night . Sources said she would be singing an ‘intimate acoustic’ set of some of her best-known hits, such as Lights and Burn, as well as a few special requests from Harry. The singer and the prince have become firm friends, hugging and posing for photographs backstage at the closing concert of the prince’s Invictus Games on Sunday. On Monday night - which was Harry’s actual birthday - Ellie tweeted a picture of a sunset and wrote: ’Gorgeous sunset tonight. Happy Birthday H.’ Rumours that Harry was having a ski resort-themed party at Kensington Palace organised by Kate and her former party-planner sister, Pippa Middleton, at the weekend appear to have been wide of the mark. But the party was still a well-deserved pat on the back for Harry after the phenomenal success of the Invictus Games, his Paralympic-style competition for injured servicemen which could be rolled out worldwide. The birthday party came amid rumours that Harry's romance with ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas is back on. The pair are said to have watched new romantic comedy  Sex Tape at the Odeon in Kensington, west London together, five months after their relationship was said to have ended. Harry's birthday fell at the end of the Invictus Games, where he is said to have shared 'a beer' with competitors .

"In the skies over Britain in the summer of 1940, the German Dornier 17 was an all too familiar sight. But few examples of the Battle of Britain bomber survived the fall of Nazi Germany and some 70 years later military historians say there is only one left. That unique aircraft has finally been raised from the bottom of the English Channel in the biggest salvage operation of its kind in British waters. It will eventually be restored and go on display as an ‘evocative and moving’ reminder of the young men of both sides who lost their lives in the battle for air supremacy in 1940. Scroll down for video . Rising leviathan: The Dornier 17 aircraft is lifted from waters of the English Channel. It was shot down during the 'Battle of Britain' in 1940 by RAF Boulton-Paul Defiant fighters. Two of its four-man Luftwaffe crew were killed as it crashed into the sea, but the other two were captured by the British and became prisoners of war . Artefact: The team watches as the aircraft is painstakingly lifted out of the sea. Aviation enthusiasts are excited because the bomber is in 'remarkable condition' The wreck was salvaged from 50ft of water on Goodwin Sands, off the Deal coast in Kent, after a three week delay because of strong winds. Despite being shot down and spending more than 70 years under the sea, it is said to be in remarkable condition. It crashed after being attacked by RAF Hurricane fighters on August 26, 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain. Two of its four-man crew were killed and the other two became prisoners of war. The Do 17 – nicknamed the ‘flying pencil’ because of its narrow fuselage – was one of the principal bombers used by the Luftwaffe in the early years of the war, including during the Blitz. The recovery of the aircraft from the seabed is a £600,000 project by the RAF Museum in North London. Its team were able to raise the aircraft  by placing metal cables around the strongest part of the frame and lifting it whole. Success: Earlier attempts to raise the craft from the sea bed were thwarted by high winds but the project finally came to fruition today. Some parts of the aircraft fell into the seas as it was being raised, but the RAF Museum tweeted that these parts will be recovered by divers. The wings and engines are intact, amazingly . Recovery: Workers secure the remains of the crashed Dornier , the only surviving one of its type. It is known as the 'pencil bomber' because of its extremely thin fuselage . In the air once more: Despite the nearly 73 years it has lain on the sea floor, the German bomber is in remarkable condition, with the wings and engine still attached . Rise: A salvage worker stands next to one of the Luftwaffe bomber's water-damaged engines Rise: A salvage worker stands next to one of the Luftwaffe bomber's water-damaged engines. It will soon go on display at the RAF Museum in London . From the depths: The Second World War Dornier 17 aircraft is lifted from waters of the English Channel today. It was first detected at Goodwin Sands in 2008 . In action: A Dornier bomber similar to the one which crashed into the sea during the Battle of Britain. The planes were 52ft long with a wingspan of 59ft, and could carry 2,000lb of explosives while manned by a crew of four. None of the aircraft were believed to have survived for long after the end of the Second World War . Peter Dye, of the RAF Museum, said: ‘The discovery and recovery of the Dornier is of national and international importance. The aircraft is a unique and unprecedented survivor from the Battle of Britain and the Blitz. ‘It will provide an evocative and moving exhibit that will allow the museum to present the wider story of the Battle of Britain and highlight the sacrifices made by the young men of both air forces. It is a project that has reconciliation and remembrance at its heart. Experts say that apart from being covered with barnacles and teeming with marine life, the Dornier is largely intact. The undercarriage tyres remain inflated although the propellers were damaged when the aircraft crashed. Chris Goss, a writer on the Luftwaffe, said the discovery of the plane was a ‘fantastic find’. He said: ‘This aircraft is going to be the only one of its type in existence. This aircraft is complete and therefore its price from a historical viewpoint is invaluable.’ The plane was found on Goodwin Sands by divers in 2008. Sonar scans by the RAF Museum, Wessex Archaeology and the Port of London Authority confirmed its identity. The recovery was backed by a National Heritage Memorial Fund grant of £345,000. A two-year restoration will take place at the RAF Museum’s site in Cosford, Shropshire, and it will later go on display at the RAF Museum in Hendon, North London.

"Ringo Starr and his wife, former Bond Girl Barbara Bach, are trying to unload a big portion of their real estate. Just last week, Starr put his palatial country estate in Surrey, England on the market for over $20million, and now it seems like he is also trying to find a buyer for his Colorado ranch. That property has been listed at $3.85million, making it the second time the famed Beatles drummer has tried to sell the property in two years. Scroll down for video . On the market: Ringo Starr is selling his Colorado ranch for $3.85million . Moving on: Star and wife Barbara Bach (above) are said to spend little time at their Colorado residence . Second time's the charm: Starr tried to sell the property for the same amount last year . Tranquil: The ranch is located in Woody Creek, 30 minutes outside Aspen . Starr's ranch, located about 30 minutes outside Aspen in Woody Creek on 15.8 acres, sits on the banks of the Roaring Fork River. There are three bedrooms, a living room that features vaulted ceilings, exposed wood beams and a neat rock fireplace, and a kitchen with, according to Curbed, 'pretty blue tile countertops.' There is also a horse pasture on the grounds. Lush grounds: The property sits on 15.8 acres and has a horse pasture . Interior: It also has three bedrooms and a large living room . Big money: Starr bought the property in 1991 for just under $1.2million . Nature: The ranch sits on the banks of the Roaring Fork River . Starr tried to sell the property last year as well for the same exact price, a big step up from the $1.164million he paid for it in 1991. The Surrey estate meanwhile is a 17th-century mansion that sits on 200 acres of land, and was purchased for just $3.1million by Starr in 1999. That means he is set to take home over $17million should it sell for its asking price. There is an indoor pool, a screening room, a helipad, five reception rooms, a spa, and eight bedrooms and seven bathrooms spread out across the 18,332-square-feet. For sale: Starr is also selling his estate in Surrey for $20million . The couple say they are unloading the properties as they are mainly living between their flat off the King’s Road in London and their American residence in California. 'We have spent 15 years at Rydinghurst and will always have wonderful memories of our time there. It is a beautiful home with some very special features, but we are, reluctantly, unable to spend as much time there as we would wish,' Starr told The Sunday Times. ‘With commitments in American and our family all in England, we will continue to divide our time between Los Angeles and London.’","Ringo Starr has just listed his Colorado Ranch for $3.85million, the same price he tried to sell it for last year .

"Premier League players should count themselves lucky they’re not fighting on the frontline in Iraq and Afghanistan before whinging about the busy Christmas schedule. That’s the very direct message from Mark Noble, who has told his fellow professionals to put up or shut up as those in the top flight face the most hectic month in the calendar. Clubs are playing seven games between now and New Year – something to have drawn heavy criticism from Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal; the Dutchman is unhappy that he can’t spend time with his wife and children. Mark Noble says the busy festive fixtures are a tradition that shouldn't be changed . But for Noble, who has a young son, while not being able to enjoy the festivities with family is an obvious drawback, it pales into insignificance when compared with others. ‘You think about soldiers out in Afghanistan or Iraq and they are not with their families and they are getting bullets fired at them whereas we are playing in the Premier League,’ Noble said. ‘You have got to put it in perspective really. ‘It is hard if you have got family and kids and you have to leave them on Christmas Day to go and train but listen, we are a small minority of lucky players. The midfielder has broken West Ham’s Premier League appearance record . ‘We have obviously worked hard for this, but we are lucky enough to have the ability to play in the Premier League. 'You have to take the good with the bad and if you have to play over Christmas you have to.

Noble and his team-mates  go into December in a European spot after a flying start to the season . But they are flying and go into Tuesday night’s game at West Brom on the back of beating in-form Newcastle at the weekend. ‘It is natural for expectations to go up. We are in a good position.

Rooney, a known fan of artists including Ed Sheeran and the Stereophonics, had a concentrated expression on his face while clicking his fingers by his side - and accompanied the picture with the caption: 'My turn to do a song at the @manchesterunited Christmas party!' In another post from the evening, Rooney is pictured possibly enjoying another player's efforts from the dance floor as his wife Coleen and players including Darren Fletcher and Ashley Young laugh in the background.

After a dire start to their season under Louis van Gaal, few would have expected to see the United players smiling so brightly come December. But here they are, after four consecutive Premier League wins, grinning from ear to ear with something to celebrate at their annual Christmas Party. Striker Robin van Persie donned a big curly-haired wig, seemingly mocking his team-mate Marouane Fellaini, in a happy snap with the Belgium midfielder and back-up keeper Anders Lindegaard.

The most expensive bottle of wine on the menu is Chateauneuf du Pape at £35.95 and a bottle of Champagne Pol Roger will set you back £165 . 'Great xmas dinner with the boys!' Van Persie posted on Instagram. The players and their partners enjoyed a night of live music, singing and a disco until the early hours of Thursday morning. Lindegaard was also confident teen star Adnan Januzaj was in good hands with himself and Fellaini 'looking after' the 19-year-old as they celebrated their season's turnaround in form. Meanwhile, Radamel Falcao and his wife Lorelei Taron were beaming as they await the arrival of their first baby. Also at the party, among others, were Chris Smalling and his partner, ex-page three girl Sam Cooke, Daley Blind and girlfriend Candy-Rae Fleur and Phil Jones and girlfriend Kaya Hall.

"The eldest daughter of former Dallas Cowboys star Pettis Norman would have celebrated her 50th birthday Wednesday, but on Monday she was found shot dead inside her downtown Dallas apartment. The body of Sharneen 'Shawn' Norman was discovered by officers performing a welfare check at around 5pm. The woman's family, including her father, contacted police after having been unable to reach her by phone for several days. Scroll down for video . Slain: Sharneen 'Shawn' Norman, 49, was discovered murdered inside her Dallas apartment Monday evening . Shocking find: Police performing a welfare check discovered Miss Norman shot dead inside her apartment at 222 Browder Street in Dallas . Dallas police say Miss Norman, a former Sony Music Entertainment executive, died from a gunshot wound and her death has been ruled a homicide, reported Dallas Morning News. Pettis Norman, 75, a former Cowboys tight end, said his daughter's apartment in the DP&L Flats building at 222 Browder Street showed no evidence of forced entry. Miss Norman met up with her father and younger sisters on Thanksgiving Day for an early birthday celebration. Then on Friday she went to Pettis Norman's home to talk about their family business, a hair product company called Liquid Love, which she had been running from her apartment. In an interview with MyFox DFW, an emotional Mr Norman recalled how on the eve of his daughter's birthday he talked to her about how people in their family lived long lives. Reflecting upon the upcoming milestone in his daughter’s life, Norman told her that she still had many years ahead of her and urged her to live them well. Heartbroken: Former NFL star Pettis Norman, 75, became concerned for his eldest daughter, Shawn, after failing to reach her for several days . Miss Norman, who was divorced and had no children, moved to Dallas from New York two years ago .

"The Princes of Wales has condemned the 'horrendous and heartbreaking' persecution of religious minorities around the world and called on faith leaders to work together to enable religious freedom. In a video address played at the House of Lords, the Prince spoke of his anguish at the plight of Christianity in the Middle East, the region of its birth. The heir to the throne also urged faith leaders to ensure believers have respect for other religions instead of remaining ‘silent’ over the suffering of minorities. Scroll down for video . The Princes of Wales has spoken out about the 'horrendous and heartbreaking' persecution of religious minorities around the world . Prince Charles made the remarks  in a video message which was recorded ahead of the publication of a report which says Christians are the 'most persecuted religious minority'. Describing religion as central to ‘our future as a free society’, he said the 'horrendous' events in Iraq and Syria had brought the subject of religious persecution 'to the forefront of the world's news' - but that it spread far wider. He said: 'The horrendous and heart-breaking events in Iraq and Syria have brought the subject of religious freedom and persecution to the forefront of the world's news. 'We have learnt with mounting despair of the expulsion of Christians, Muslims and Yazidis from towns and cities that their ancestors have occupied for centuries. 'Sadly, incidents of violence in Iraq and Syria are not isolated. They are found throughout some, though not all, of the Middle East; in some African nations; and in many countries across Asia.' He added: 'It is an indescribable tragedy that Christianity is now under such threat in the Middle East – an area where Christians have lived for 2,000 years, and across which Islam spread in 700 AD, with people of different faiths living together peaceably for centuries. 'It seems to me that our future as a free society – both here in Britain and throughout the world – depends on recognising the crucial role played by people of faith.' Suggesting 'several tangible courses of action', Prince Charles said faith leaders have a 'responsibility to ensure that people within their own tradition respect people from other faith traditions'. He added: 'We have yet to see the full potential of faith communities working together. In the video, Prince Charles describes the work he has undertaken to 'encourage dialogue and greater understanding between different faith traditions' He said the 'horrendous' events in Iraq and Syria had brought the subject of religious freedom and persecution 'to the forefront of the world's news' but that it spread far wider . 'Such efforts aimed at peace and mediation are possible. The report from Aid to the Church in Need highlights the example of a Muslim Imam, a Catholic Archbishop and a Protestant Minister coming together to form an inter-religious peace group in the Central African Republic. 'These seeds of hope can germinate even in nations and regions torn apart by war and violence.' He also called on governments to do their best to uphold Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights upholding the freedom of religion. But he said that this is often challenged, even in the West, adding: 'Sadly, in many other countries, an absence of freedom to determine one's own faith is woven into the laws and customs of the nation.' The Prince has become one of the most high-profile names to speak out about the persecution of Christians. Last December, he held a reception in Clarence House in response 'to the growing plight of Christians threatened by persecution in the Middle East. Having listened to their concerns, I did my best to highlight the gravity of the crisis.' In September he wrote a letter to Chaldean Patriarch Louis Raphael Sako, stating that he was 'heartbroken' by the situation in Iraq, and explaining that he had sent a cheque to Aid to the Church in Need to help their work in the Middle East. This winter the charity is launching its biggest ever drive to provide shelter, food and education to 120,000 displaced Iraqi Christians in the Kurdish-controlled north of the country. The report by Aid to the Church in Need includes an introduction by Dr Paul Bhatti, brother of murdered Pakistani minister for minorities, Shabhaz Bhatti. The report concludes that of 196 countries in the world, 81 countries – or 41 percent – are identified as places where religious freedom is impaired, either 'high or medium', or is in decline. Of the others, 18 per cent were 'of concern' and the remaining 41 per cent included 'no concerns'. The heir to the throne made the remarks about religious freedom in a recorded video message for the charity Aid to the Church in Need . Prince Charles's comments come as a Christian couple were beaten to death and burned in a brick kiln in Pakistan for allegedly desecrating the Koran. The killing took place in the kiln where the couple worked in the town of Kot Radha Kishan in eastern Punjab province, police said. The attack is the latest to target minorities in Pakistan for alleged blasphemy. Under Pakistan's blasphemy laws, anyone accused of insulting Islam or the Prophet Mohammed can be sentenced to death. However, the laws are often used to settle personal scores and target minorities. Shahbaz Sharif, the top elected official in the province, has ordered a probe into the incident. 'The horrendous and heart-breaking events in Iraq and Syria have brought the subject of religious freedom and persecution to the forefront of the world's news. 'We have learnt with mounting despair of the expulsion of Christians, Muslims and Yazidis from towns and cities that their ancestors have occupied for centuries. 'Sadly, incidents of violence in Iraq and Syria are not isolated. They are found throughout some, though not all, of the Middle East; in some African nations; and in many countries across Asia. 'Thankfully, despite this bleak picture, there are inspirational people of different faiths joining together to overcome division and hatred. 'It is a well established principle of inter-faith dialogue that we judge each other by the best expressions of our faith, rather than our worst. 'Over several decades, I have been working to encourage dialogue and greater understanding between different faith traditions. Indeed, last December, I hosted a reception at Clarence House in response to the growing plight of Christians threatened by persecution in the Middle East. 'Having listened to their concerns, I did my best to highlight the gravity of the crisis. In February, during a visit to the Middle East, I attended an inter-faith dialogue which included key Christian and Muslim scholars and clergy during which we discussed the Christian-Muslim relationship. 'It is an indescribable tragedy that Christianity is now under such threat in the Middle East, an area where Christians have lived for 2,000 years and across which Islam spread in 700AD with people of different faiths living together peaceably for centuries. 'It seems to me that our future as a free society – both here in Britain and throughout the world – depends on recognising the crucial role played by people of faith. 'And of course religious faith is all the more convincing to those outside the faith when it is expressed with humility and compassion, giving space to others whatever their beliefs. 'With this in mind I would like to suggest several tangible courses of action which I believe might be helpful. 'First and foremost, rather than remaining silent, faith leaders have a responsibility it seems to me to ensure people within their own tradition respect people from other faith traditions. 'We have yet to see the full potential of faith communities working together, however, to do this effectively requires not only maturity in one's own faith but also in essential humility. 'I believe that to speak to another faith tradition and to defend those who follow it, it is profoundly helpful to speak from the core of one's own core spiritual experience. 'My own Christian faith has enabled me to speak to and to listen to people from other traditions including Islam and, as Pope Francis has recently said, such interfaith dialogue is a necessary condition for peace in the world and should be seen as a duty for all Christians, as well as for believers from other religious communities. 'Such efforts aimed at peace and mediation are possible. The report from Aid to the Church in Need highlights the example of a Muslim Imam, a Catholic Archbishop and a Protestant Minister coming together to form an inter-religious peace group in the Central African Republic. 'These seeds of hope can germinate even in nations and regions torn apart by war and violence. 'Secondly it is essential that governments honour their duty to uphold the right of people to practice their faith. 'Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of human rights is clear in stating this right includes the right to change one's religion or belief. Yet even in the west this right is often challenge . 'Sadly, in many other countries, an absence of freedom to determine one's own faith is woven into the laws and customs of the nation.'","Heir to the throne made plea for leaders of all world faiths to work together .

"Jose Mourinho insisted Chelsea’s comfortable win over Tottenham proves his side can cope without Diego Costa. The Spain international was suspended for Wednesday night’s clash, but the Blues hardly missed their first-choice striker as Didier Drogba produced a virtuoso display. And even when Drogba was substituted in the second half, his replacement Loic Remy scored an exceptional goal to seal victory. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Mourinho: Didier Drogba is remarkable, he's a team player . Jose Mourinho (far left) watches Chelsea take on Tottenham while Diego Costa watches (centre, far right) Didier Drogba filled in for Costa on Wednesday night and scored during Chelsea's 3-0 win over Tottenham . ‘We need Costa, but I think our mentality is the right mentality,’ said Mourinho. ‘We don’t have a player? We don’t cry about it. You give confidence to the others and the others respond in the best way.’ Costa is available for Saturday’s clash against Newcastle, meaning match-winner Drogba could find himself back on the bench at St James’ Park. However, Chelsea will be without key midfielder Nemanja Matic, who picked up his fifth yellow card of the season on Wednesday night, through suspension. But like the Blues coped without Costa, Mourinho insists his table-toppers can deal without their midfield lynchpin this weekend. ‘Matic is suspended? No problem, no problem,’ said Mourinho . Drogba celebrates scoring against Tottenham as the Blues went on to record a 3-0 win over their rivals . Chelsea will be without Nemanja Matic at Newcastle, who picked up his fifth yellow card of the season . ‘We’ll play another one, like Diego Costa. Did you remember Diego Costa tonight? I didn’t. We give confidence to the other people. ‘We don’t cry when somebody cannot play. Obviously Matic is playing fantastically well for us. But that’s the way we think. To forget him. ‘December is a difficult month and it’s almost impossible for players to play every game this month - certainly later in the month so I have to change some players. ‘Of course, Diego Costa is already rested and now Matic is suspended for one game so he will be rested.’ Spurs still haven’t won at Stamford Bridge since 1990, where Gary Lineker scored the winner - and Mourinho joked: 'I think Lineker is happy with that.’ Meanwhile, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino insisted his players believed they could end their 24-year Stamford Bridge hoodoo. ‘If you watch the game again, I think the answer is easy: we believed,’ said the Argentine. ‘We showed we believed we could get a positive result, but this is football. The first chance they created, they scored. The second chance, the second goal.’ Loic Remy celebrates making it 3-0 to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge against Tottenham .

"A couple in New York wandered into a reporter's live shot from Wednesday night's Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting then thought it would be funny to re-enact the final moments of Eric Garner's life. The outrageous prank is made all the more shocking by the fact that WPIX reporter Allison Kaden was on the scene to report on the protest at the ceremony. As she described the night's peaceful demonstration, a man in a suit and a woman noticed they were on camera. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Allison Kaden of WPIX in New York was covering the protests of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting ceremony when the couple pictured behind her used the opportunity to mock Eric Garner, it appears . Threw her hands up: The man in the suit first noticed the camera, but the woman threw her hands in the air, as Eric garner did just before his death, after it dawned on her what her companion was doing . The man grabbed the woman around the neck and then, as it dawned on the woman what her friend was doing, she played along and put her hands up. They both then laughed and walked off camera. Kaden finished her segment non-the-wiser. The in-studio anchors didn't seem to notice, either. However, the folks at Deadspin picked up on the sick joke and the angry comments were sure to follow. With good reason. Garner died following his altercation with police due, at least in part, to the chokehold put on him by Officer Daniel Pantaleo. The couple laugh as they scuttle out of the shot and WPIX reporter Allison Kaden finishes her segment non-the-wiser . The tree lighting ceremony came just hours after a grand jury decided not to indict a Pantaleo in Garner's  videotaped chokehold death. Mayor Bill de Blasio canceled his scheduled appearance to meet with elected officials and activists on Staten Island as citywide protests started to gather steam. Police presence was heavy as hundreds of protesters stood behind rows of police barricades jamming the sidewalks on Fifth Avenue within sight of the holiday revelers. A block away on Sixth Avenue, police in riot gear faced off with protesters behind metal barricades. But the annual tradition went on as planned.

"A simple test could help ensure asthmatic children get the right amount of medication to help prevent future asthma attacks. The test can accurately measure levels of inflammation within the urine that give warning signs of an imminent attack. Research led by Queen Mary University of London could result in a ‘transformational’ step to preventing worsening symptoms, hospital admissions and deaths. The research led by Queen Mary University could help prevent worsening symptoms, hospital admissions and deaths. (file picture) The UK has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma symptoms in the world, affecting 1.1 million children. One in 11 British children in the UK has asthma, the most common long term condition in childhood. Researchers reviewed 73 children aged 7-15 years to investigate the most efficient and non-invasive way of finding the optimum level of anti-inflammatory treatment for asthma. They analysed levels of prostaglandin metabolites - chemicals released by immune cells that are activated in asthma - in the urine. One of the ‘protective’ prostaglandins was greatly reduced in those children who went on to have an asthma attack within three months, giving an early warning of a worsening condition. Testing was carried out among children with asthma on days when they had no symptoms, and the researchers counted the number of days when they received medical attention or missed school due to asthma symptoms. These urine samples were compared with those of children who did not have asthma. The findings by the QML researchers, in partnership with Jagiellonian University Medical School in Krakow, Poland, are being presented today (thurs) at The British Thoracic Society Winter Meeting (must credit) in London. Dr Rossa Brugha, co-author of the report and Clinical Research Fellow at Queen Mary University of London hospital, said ‘The key factor in treating children with asthma is to tailor their medicine accurately, ensuring the right amount of anti-inflammatory medication is being prescribed. ‘This simple urine test provides an accurate way to assess chemical markers in the child’s urine, which show the level of inflammation caused by the asthma. ‘When children see their GP for their annual review, we hope that this test can help indicate the level of steroid medication they actually need. Dr Samantha Walker from Asthma UK said the research was 'promising' ‘If implemented it will help the child to manage their asthma more effectively and hopefully reduce the number of asthma attacks.’ Dr Bernard Higgins, Chairman of the British Thoracic Society Executive Committee, and consultant lung specialist at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle said ‘GPs manage a large number of children with asthma throughout the UK - and this simple test could help them to prescribe tailored treatment. ‘Most of all this is good news for the well-being of our children with asthma, but attacks of asthma are expensive to treat and if this helps us prevent them it could also save vital NHS resources.’ Asthma is a condition that affects the airways – the small tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. When a person with asthma comes into contact with something that irritates their airways, the muscles around the walls of the airways tighten and become narrower, and the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and starts to swell, causing difficulty in breathing and other symptoms.. Dr Samantha Walker, Director of Research and Policy at Asthma UK, said ‘Asthma is a complex condition that affects 1 in 11 children in the UK, yet years of research underfunding means it still remains a relative mystery. ‘The development of a simple test that can be used to accurately identify children at risk of an asthma attack and then to get them on the right dose of the right treatment could be transformational in preventing attacks; this research is a promising step in that direction. ‘Parents of children with asthma now need to see more investment in asthma research like this so that life-changing breakthroughs become a reality. We need to keep children with asthma healthy and out of hospital.’","The UK has one of the highest childhood asthma rates in the world .

"Click here for Chris Wheeler's match report from the Stadium of Light . Manuel Pellegrini has fired a warning to league leaders Chelsea by declaring that his champions are back to their title-winning best. Manchester City were impressive 4-1 winners at Sunderland on Wednesday night with Sergio Aguero (2), Steven Jovetic and father-to-be Pablo Zabaleta on target. They fell behind to Connor Wickham’s 19th-minute effort on the ground where they have been beaten 1-0 on their last four visits. VIDEO Scroll down for Manuel Pellegrini: We are returning to our form from last season . Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero equalises with a ferocious strike against Sunderland . Aguero's strike had Sunderland sub Jozy Altidore flinching and exclaiming: ‘Oh my God!’ But Aguero soon drew them level before teeing up Jovetic for a second. Zabaleta – who married fiancée Christel during the summer - celebrated news of her pregnancy with a classy third after the break and Aguero then stole in for his 19th of the season. The striker's thumping shot was so powerful that it took Sunderland substitute Jozy Altidore by surprise – the American could be seen flinching before exclaiming: ‘Oh my God!’ It keeps the gap to Chelsea – 3-0 winners over Spurs – at six points. And Pellegrini said: ‘We are returning to the form we showed last season, especially after we beat Bayern Munich (3-2 last month). Aguero blasted the ball into the top corner past Sunderland goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon . Steven Jovetic rifled the second through Pantilimon's legs as City went 2-1 ahead . ‘There is trust in the team, it is different now, we are getting our normal performances. When the team plays that way, with one touch, moving the ball quickly, we are going to return to being a top team.’ He went on: ‘Finally we have won here. For the last four years we couldn’t do it. We repeated the performance we showed against Southampton last weekend (won 3-0) and I’m very happy about that.’ Of Aguero, who won applause from the home crowd when he was substituted late on, he added: ‘I don’t know if there is a better striker in Europe. There are a lot of good strikers, but in the last few games I think he has shown he is one of the best five players in the world. It’s not just that he is scoring, he is also playing very well generally.’ Zabaleta waits for Pantilimon to go down before calmly dinking his shot over the keeper for the third . Pablo Zabaleta celebrates scoring City's third by putting a ball under his shirt - a gesture to his pregnant wife Christel . Chelsea could only draw 0-0 at Sunderland at the weekend but remain odds-on favourites for the title. Pellegrini, though, insists it is ridiculous to determine the champions before Christmas. ‘I’ve always said it is impossible to know who is going to be champions at this time of year when you still have to play 24 games,’ he said. ‘If we continue playing in this way, I’m sure we will be in the fight for the title. Chelsea are also playing very well, but I don’t think it will just be two teams fighting for the title. There will be three or four teams fighting for the title. Manchester United have won their last four games and Arsenal are coming again.’ Pantilimon is helpless as Aguero scores Manchester City's fourth goal on Wednesday night .

"A young boy battling terminal cancer got the thrill of a lifetime this weekend when he scored a touchdown in his first ever football game. Liam Myrick, a six-year-old from Houston, Missouri, who is fighting stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, got a chance to play for the Mountain Grove Mighty Mite football team, and serve as an honorary team captain for the day. Even better, with the help of his new teammates, he also managed to run in a touchdown from 15-yards out. Big day: Liam Myrick (above with football) scored a touchdown at his first ever football game over the weekend . Fighter : Liam (above) has been battling stage 4 cancer since he was just three-years-old . Unfortunately, the excitement was short lived, as moments later the young boy was forced to take medication for his pain. Since being diagnosed at the age of 3, Liam has undergone 14 rounds of intravenous chemotherapy, two bone marrow transplants, 20 rounds of radiation and nine major surgeries his mother, Shawna Myrick, told FoxNews.com. 'His cancer is growing again and there’s not a lot that they can do because he has fluid around his heart, and the one kidney he has left is starting to fail as well as his live,' she added. The Myrick family says they got a call from Mighty Mite coach Jerry Elliot last week, saying the team would like to honor Liam at a game. Score: Moments after his big touchdown celebration, Liam was forced to take medication for his pain . Horrible news: Doctors have said that due to Liam's low energy levels the young boy does not have much time left . Helping hand: Liam's parents have set up a page where people can donate to their son's treatment . He ran through the banner with the other boys at the start of the game, participated in the coin toss, and then scored his big touchdown. 'It’s probably one of the coolest memories we’ve had,' Shawna said. Doctors have told the family that due to Liam's low energy levels, they don't think he has much time left. The family has set up a Facebook page where people can donate to help offset the cost of Liam's treatments and care here.","Liam Myrick, a six-year-old battling terminal cancer, scored a touchdown at his first football game this weekend .

"These days we pick up a packet of frozen prawns from the supermarket almost without thinking. They’re healthy, flavour-some and cheap enough to count as an affordable treat, perhaps on a skewer for a barbecue or daintily arranged for a dinner party starter. If we give even a moment’s thought about where they come from we probably imagine a sun-burnished fisherman skilfully tossing his nets out into the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean or South China Sea before hauling in his valuable catch. Nothing, I’m afraid, could be further from the truth. Intensively farmed: Jumbo tiger prawns are not so appealing after seeing the putrid factories where feed is processed for the prawn farms . As an environmental journalist, I’ve visited Thailand, the world’s leading exporter of farmed king prawns, many times to investigate the prawn trade, and what I discovered is so horrifying I will never eat another king prawn again. Every aspect of this trade is stomach churning: from the putrid factories that process the feed to the prawn farms that pollute the oceans. Welcome to the rotting, stinking and very dangerous world of the prawn trade, a world where industrial fishing boats exploit illegal slave labour to harvest the so-called ‘trash fish’ on which the prawns are fed and leave devastating environmental damage in their wake. I began my investigation aboard the trawlers that plunder the seas to provide the feed for the prawn farms along Thailand’s shoreline. While on board, I discovered that trafficked labourers from Burma and Cambodia are forced to work 20 hours a day, seven days a week, on boats where they are often beaten, abused, even killed by unscrupulous skippers. These men suffer appalling treatment — some even dying on ship and having their bodies tossed casually overboard — just so we can taste king prawns in a lunchtime sandwich or Friday night curry. The damage to our oceans is also devastating. Watching a haul of trash fish being . pulled over the side of a Thai fishing boat is a heart-breaking sight: a . muddy mess of seaweed and rocks mixed with a vast variety of small or . juvenile sea creatures: crabs, starfish, sponges and small fish that . will not get the chance to grow any bigger. 'Horrifying': Jim Wickens says that now he has seen Thailand's king prawn trade first hand, he will never eat a one again . It was a sight I had to get used to as I worked undercover on these boats. My technique for getting aboard was a dangerous one. More than once I had to throw myself into the sea so that a passing trash fish boat was obliged to ‘rescue’ me. From my vantage point on deck, I saw how this grisly industry operates at first hand. Every few hours, a whistle would sound and a net would be hauled up from the depths, raised above the deck and, on a signal from the captain, the contents spilled out. Panicked marine creatures including sea snakes, baby octopus, sea horses, puffer fish and pretty pink crabs would scurry across the deck, only to be crushed underfoot and shovelled up into a heap before being thrown into the hold. These trawlermen employ one of the most environmentally damaging forms of commercial fishing to be found anywhere in the world: bottom trawling. This practice, which sees the nets weighted down so that they sink to the sea bed, is enormously destructive. Entire tranches of marine life are effectively swept away and habitats and ecosystems that might have been there for centuries are destroyed. Breeding populations of many marine species are being all but destroyed and with them the futures of local fishermen who, until the arrival of the bottom trawlers, had been harvesting sustainable catches of local fish for decades. But no longer. Back on deck, the often enslaved crews, who are tricked into coming to Thailand by the false promise of generous wages, are woken by the deafening blare of an air horn mounted above their cramped sleeping quarters. Exhausted, but too frightened to disobey an order, they stumble to the deck to sort through the latest trash fish catch. It’s only really the rocks and the weed that go over the side; everything else is shovelled into an already stinking hold. Many of these boats do have ice-controlled holds, but they are reserved for commercially valuable catches. The trash fish go straight into a filthy compartment where, with boats often at sea for days at a time, they soon start to rot. Damage: The Thai fishing trade leaves serious environmental damage in its wake and pollution in the ocean . By the time they return to port, the stench from these holds is almost unimaginable and there are regular reports of crewmen fainting and even dying after they’ve been sent into the holds to help with unloading, only to be overcome by the toxic fumes. These men are often at sea for months, even years at a time, thanks to the unscrupulous practice of transferring crew from a returning vessel loaded with fish, to an empty trawler setting out. In such harsh working conditions, where disobedience is often met with a beating from a metal pipe or even a bullet, suicides are common and murders not unknown. One crewman I spoke to had been shot at four times and had seen at least one crewmate killed. These desperate men are dying unnoticed, far out at sea, hundreds of miles from their homes and family.Once the trawlers return to port, the commercially valuable fish are unloaded first and sold at the dockside market. Putrid: The king prawns are fed on 'trash fish' It is only later in the day, when the market has cleared and the port almost seems to have shut down, that the trash fish trucks arrive. Time and again, I witnessed the boats’ stinking holds being unloaded and their rotting cargo shovelled into ten-tonne dumper trucks. From here, it is a very smelly ride to an industrial processing plant, where the feed destined for prawn farms is produced. It is produced amid swarms of flies, temperatures that can approach 38C and a sweltering humidity of 100 per cent. The stench is foul. Load upon load of putrid fish and decaying marine creatures is poured into fetid storage containers. Every now and then you spot the eye of a beautiful coral fish or the glint of a long-dead starfish as the noxious mess is crushed and passed through a series of ovens until the final product — fish flour — is obtained. Transformed into pellets, this is then driven to the prawn farms that have all but destroyed Thailand’s mangrove forests. If you’d driven down the coast of the Gulf of Thailand 20 or 30 years ago you’d have seen mile after mile of these flooded forests, an incredible breeding ground for fish and a natural barrier that protected Thai farmers and their land from tsunamis. Today, however, most of these forests are gone. In their place is mile after mile of prawn ponds, their valuable contents protected by high fencing and security lighting. In these ponds, prawns are farmed on an industrial scale to meet booming demand from consumers in North America and Europe. In Britain, we consume about 85,000 tonnes of prawns a year, two-thirds of which are warm-water prawns like those farmed in Thailand. The trade is worth £450 million in Britain alone. Prawns need brackish, slightly salty water, which is why former mangrove forests that have been cleared of their trees and cut off by sluices from the sea are ideal. But prawns also need feeding — a lot of feeding. Spend a day peering through one of those security fences and you’ll see men coming out every few hours to toss another bucket of ‘feed’ to the growing prawns. I watched from the side of one prawn pond as they prepared to harvest the fattened prawns. The sluices were opened and the prawns caught in a filter as the water drained out. They are beheaded and frozen in minutes but, in many cases, the filthy lagoon water, a grim cocktail of several months’ worth of excreta and food waste, is simply washed out into what’s left of the surrounding mangrove forests or straight out to sea. Concerned about Thailand: In Hugh's Fish Fight, TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall went to examine farmed King Prawns, at Asia's biggest prawn market near Bangkok . Thailand does have marine conservation laws designed to protect both its coastal waters and specially designated marine conservation reserves. But these are poorly policed and routinely ignored by ruthless commercial fishing fleets whose only concern is short-term profit at any cost. Meanwhile, thousands of miles from this marine destruction, we unthinkingly bite into a delicious skewer of tiger prawns, perhaps coated with garlic butter. But what are the alternatives to industrially produced prawns? Some certification schemes for so-called ‘responsibly produced’ prawns do exist, and marginal improvements to farming practices are beginning to take place. But in my research I have found that none of the certification schemes properly address the damage being done to local communities or the destruction to the marine environment caused by trash fishing. King prawns can also be produced organically. Naturally, this makes them very expensive for supermarket customers. But even organic prawn farming usually requires the destruction of wild mangrove forest — even if trash fishing has been avoided. As consumers, however, we can look elsewhere. There are cold-water prawns from the North Atlantic, which currently account for about one-third of all prawns eaten in this country. Dublin Bay prawns from the Irish Sea  — most of which are currently exported to France as langoustine — are another alternative. Neither, however, is currently available as cheaply or conveniently as Thailand’s tiger prawns. The only answer, I believe, is to stop eating warm-water king prawns altogether. I, for one, don’t want slave labour and the destruction of the ocean mixed in with my prawn cocktail. Do you?","'I'll never eat a king prawn again' says Wickens after seeing Thai prawn trade .

"The US Navy has launched an investigation into allegations that some of the first female sailors to serve on submarines were secretly videotaped in the shower by a male serviceman. According to an incident report written last month, the unsuspecting women were recorded bathing and changing aboard the ballistic missile submarine USS Wyoming. A 24-year-old second class petty officer allegedly made the videos over the past year and distributed them among his male colleagues. Violated: US Navy has launched investigation into allegations that some of the first women to serve on the USS Wyoming were secretly videotaped in the shower by a male sailor . Vile act: A 24-year-old second class petty officer is accused of recording at least three women while they were showering on undressed aboard the Ohio-class ballistic missile sub . The clips were said to depict at least three servicewomen in the shower and in various states of undress aboard the Wyoming - an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine with its homeport in Kings Bay, Georgia, reported the Navy Times. The first female sailors were introduced to American subs beginning in 2011 as part of a concerted integration effort, which has been labeled a success by the Navy. The privacy violation scandal comes at an especially sensitive time as Navy officials are preparing to integrate Virginia-class attack submarines. Come January, six female officers will join the crews of USS Virginia and USS Minnesota, according to a statement issued in October 2013 by Vice Admiral Michael Connor, commander of Submarine Forces. A ballistic missile sub such as the USS Wyoming typically has 15 officers and 140 enlisted crew members on board. Officers of both sexes use the same bathing facilities, but whenever a woman is in the shower she is expected to put up a sign indicating her presence inside, and her male comrades must wait until she comes out before entering. Trailblazers: USS Wyoming was among the first submarines to welcome female officers in 2011 . Smooth sailing: The integration of ballistic missile submarine crews, which got under way in 2010, has been labeled a success by the Navy . According to Navy Times, some of the women depicted in the videos are unhappy with the way Navy brass has been handling the incident. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service has launched a probe into the matter, and a spokeswoman for Submarine Group 10 in Kings Bay said the Navy would hold those involved accountable. The man accused of videotaping his female colleagues has not been named in the November 14 incident report, but he has been described as a petty officer assigned to Trident Training Facility. Investigators were first tipped off about the videos last month by an officer from another submarine who received the recordings. The USS Wyoming was at the forefront of the integration effort, welcoming a dozen female supply and line officers in 2011. A retired supply officer who was in charge of mentoring the new arrivals recalled how on the first day of their tenure she was approached by a male sailor who asked her: 'Where are the females?' ‘I looked at him and said, “All right, let's get one thing straight: They're not females, they're junior officers on this boat, they're division officers, and you will address them as Ensign So-and-So, and you can tell everybody else on the boat, ‘"" she told the paper. Poor timing: The videotape scandal comes at a time when Navy officials are preparing to introduce female sailors to Virginia-class attack subs . In an ABC News story from May 2012, female submariners talked in glowing terms about how smoothly the integration has been going, and how their biggest challenge was becoming junior officers. ‘Outside of being female on a submarine, all of us are trying to qualify, all of us are trying to support the ward room and trying to be a team member. That is challenging, in itself,’ Ensign Abigail Holt said at the time. Female officers now serve on at least seven subs. By 2020, the Navy will allow enlisted female sailors to serve on submarines as well. Since the Navy lifted its ban on female submariners in 2010, at least 43 women have joined the service.","US Navy has launched investigation into alleged privacy violations aboard ballistic missile submarine USS Wyoming .

"A plane flying from Nigeria to London had to make an emergency landing on a Spanish island when a woman gave birth in business class. Ujunwa Eneh Ozeh, who turned 31 today, went into labour at 36,000 feet while flying from her home town of Abuja, Nigeria's capital, to London Heathrow, despite only being 26 weeks pregnant. The pilot of the British Airways flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Palme de Mallorce, in the Balearic Islands, where the mother and baby, who has been called Michael, were rushed to the island's Son Espases hospital. Scroll down for video . Ujunwa Ozeh was on a British Airways flight when she went into labour at only 26 weeks pregnant . The Boeing 777 was flying from Abuja, Nigeria, to London Heathrow but had to make an emergency landing in Palma de Mallorca . An example of a flatbed in a BA flight's Club Class section, where Mrs Ozeh gave birth . While Mrs Ozeh will be discharged on Monday, Michael is currently in the intensive care unit and will remain in hospital until August, around his original due date, so he can develop properly. Mrs Ozeh said: 'I don't have any other option than to stay here on the island. My baby needs me to just hang in there for him until it is safe for him to come home with me.' The mother-of-two was travelling with her one-year-old daughter Nnedinma and was planning to catch a connecting flight from London to Washington, USA, where she was taking the little girl for vacation. Nnedinma was born in the United States but Mrs Ozeh is insistent she was not retuning the country to have Micheal. She said: 'I was going for the summer, Michael was not due until August, there is no way I would be able to stay in the United States until August. I had a return ticket to Nigeria booked for May 28, so I intended to stay for a few weeks and then go home.' When her water broke, fellow passengers alerted the cabin crew who put out a call for doctors over the intercom. A female doctor, currently unidentified, was onboard and able to oversee the birth with the help of flight crew, who are trained in birthing procedures. At first, the housewife at first refused to believe she had gone into labour so early. It used to be the case that a baby born on board a British ship or aircraft would automatically get British citizenship. This was based on a UN directive aimed at minimising the number of people in the world without a registered state. However, . the British Nationality Act 1981, stated that any such baby, born after . January 1, 1983, would not be granted British citizenship unless at . least one parent already held it. Mrs Ozeh said: 'I just wasn't thinking that I could be in labour, I couldn't imagine it. When the doctor told me that the baby was coming I went into total shock, I can't really remember, I wasn't able to think clearly.' Once the plane had touched down, mother and baby were raced to hospital where they are stable. Mrs Ozeh said: 'I am fine and healthy and the doctor said that Michael is doing pretty well, that it's looking good and he is trying to survive.' Her husband, Kaycee Ozeh, a local businessman in Nigeria, is now scurrying to get a visa so he can travel to be with his wife and children. Mrs Ozeh said she had never thought the baby would come so early, or would not have attempted travelling. Ujunwa Ozeh and baby Michael was rushed to hospital after the plane landed on the island of Palma de Mallorca, pictured. Michael is currently in the ICU and will be kept in hospital until August . She said: 'Right now, [Mr Ozeh] doesn't have a Spanish visa but I need him to come here. I don't know what I'm going to do when I get out of the hospital, I'm completely in the dark. I need my husband because I don't know the next step to take.' Under BA regulations, pregnant woman can . fly on their planes until the end of their 36th week, or 32nd week if . carrying more than one baby. Once the emergency was dealt with, the plane continued on to the UK, arriving only thirty minutes late.

"Professor Lennart Bengtsson, who claims his research on global warming is being 'covered up' A scientific study which suggests global warming has been exaggerated was rejected by a respected journal because it might fuel climate scepticism, it was claimed last night. The alarming intervention, which raises fears of ‘McCarthyist’ pressure for environmental scientists to conform, came after a reviewer said the research was ‘less than helpful’ to the climate cause. Professor Lennart Bengtsson, a research fellow at the University of Reading and one of five authors of the study, said he suspected that intolerance of dissenting views on climate science was preventing his paper from being published. ‘The problem we now have in the climate community is that some scientists are mixing up their scientific role with that of a climate activist,’ he told the Times. Prof Bengtsson’s paper suggests that the Earth’s environment might be much less sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought. If he and his four co-authors are correct, it would mean that carbon dioxide and other pollutants are having a far less severe impact on climate than green activists would have us believe. The research, if made public, would be a huge challenge to the finding of the UN’s Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change (IPCC), that the global average temperature would rise by up to 4.5C if greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were allowed to double. The paper suggested that the climate might be less sensitive to greenhouse gases than had been claimed by the IPCC in its report last September, and recommended that more work be carried out ‘to reduce the underlying uncertainty’. The five contributing scientists submitted the paper to Environmental Research Letters – a highly regarded journal – but were told it had been rejected. A scientist asked by the journal to assess the paper under the peer review process reportedly wrote: ‘It is harmful as it opens the door for oversimplified claims of “errors” and worse from the climate sceptics media side.’ Prof Bengtsson, 79, said it was ‘utterly unacceptable’ to advise against publishing a paper on the political grounds. He said: ‘It is an indication of how science is gradually being influenced by political views. The reality hasn’t been keeping up with the [computer] models. Professor Bengtsson currently works for the Meteorology department at the University of Reading . ‘If people are proposing to do major changes to the world’s economic system we must have much more solid information.’ Next year the UN hopes to broker an international agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol which would impose legally binding targets on every country. The last attempt, at the Copenhagen conference in 2009, ended in disaster, with recriminations flying and all chances of a deal in tatters. The Paris conference in December 2015 is thought by many politicians to be the last realistic chance for a deal to be made if disastrous climate change is to be averted. A controversy at this stage risks putting the science which underpins the negotiations at doubt, something many - not least politicians in Britain and the US - will be keen to avoid. The publisher of the Environmental Research Letters journal last night said Professor Bengtsson’s paper had been rejected because it contained errors and did not sufficiently advance the science. A spokesman for IOP Publishing said: ‘The paper, co-authored by Lennart Bengtsson, was originally submitted to Environmental Research Letters as a research Letter. ‘This was peer-reviewed by two independent reviewers, who reported that the paper contained errors and did not provide a significant advancement in the field, and therefore failed to meet the journal’s required acceptance criteria. ‘As a consequence, the independent reviewers recommended that the paper should not be published in the journal which led to the final editorial decision to reject the paper.’","Professor Lennart Bengtsson claims his study on global warming has been rejected as it might fuel climate scepticism .

"Tiny quantities of anti-depressants flushed down our sinks and toilets are having a dramatic effect on the behaviour and biology of crustaceans. Scientists are becoming increasingly aware that common drugs including Prozac and Sertraline are ending up in our seas and rivers via human waste treatment plants. The research found even low concentrations of these drugs are causing the creatures to change colour, grow larger or spawn more regularly. Researchers claim aquatic wildlife, such as the spot prawn pictured, can be affected by exceedingly small amounts - as little as one nanogramme per litre - of prescription drugs. The research found even low concentrations of these drugs can cause creatures to change colour, grow larger or spawn more regularly . A range of antidepressants aimed at pets with behavioural problems could become available in the UK later this year. Prozac-style drugs would help benefit 80 per cent of Britain's eight million dogs, according to a recent study. The research found that the idiosyncrasies of man’s best friend, such as chasing their tail relentlessly and barking at the door even if nobody is there, are often born from psychological problems such as anxiety and phobic behaviour. And in some cases, a lower concentration affected the creatures more than a higher dose. ‘There is a staggering list of prescription drugs passed from humans to wastewater treatment plants and into receiving streams, estuaries, or oceans by direct consumption, metabolism, and excretion, or by toilet flushing of old prescriptions,’ said Dr Alex Ford, a marine biologist from the University of Portsmouth. ‘Marine invertebrates, such as amphipod shrimp become more active and increase their speed of movement, while freshwater snails display altered reproduction, and some lose their ability to attach to surfaces. ‘Some bivalve species, such as zebra mussels, were induced to spawn when exposed to anti-depressants. Researchers claim a staggering number of prescription drugs, including Prozac, stock image pictured, are being passed from humans to wastewater treatment plants and into streams, estuaries, or oceans by direct consumption, metabolism, and excretion, or by toilet flushing of old prescriptions . Some bivalve species, including zebra mussels, pictured left, are induced to spawn when exposed to antidepressants. Marine invertebrates, such as amphipod shrimp become more active while freshwater snails, pictured right, display altered reproduction and some lose their ability to attach to surfaces . Dr Ford added that just as antidepressants affect hormones such as serotonin in the human brain, many biological functions within invertebrates are similarly under the control of serotonin. ‘In many invertebrates, serotonin controls the release of certain pigments, causing the creature to change colour and recent studies have shown that anti-depressants can alter colour changes in cuttlefish. The drugs can also affect growth, feeding and metabolism,’ he said. ‘What we now know is they can be affected by exceedingly small amounts, as little as one nanogram per litre - the equivalent of dropping a few grains of the compound into an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Just as anti-depressants affect hormones such as serotonin in the human brain, many biological functions within invertebrates are similarly under the control of serotonin. For example, in invertebrates such as the cuttlefish, pictured, serotonin controls the release of certain pigments, causing the creature to change colour . ‘Although concentrations observed in our rivers and estuaries are very small, it's worrying that an increasing number of studies have shown that these incredibly small concentrations can dramatically alter the biology of the organisms they come in contact with.’ Dr Ford said the release of human pharmaceuticals into aquatic ecosystems is an environmental problem we should consider seriously. ‘A body of evidence is building that suggests anti-depressants at concentrations currently found in surface, waste and groundwater are sufficient to cause a wide variety of effects. ‘This is despite the fact that reports indicate these types of drugs take up only 4 per cent of the known pharmaceuticals detected in the environment.’ The research is published in the journal Aquatic Toxicology.","A 'staggering' amount of drugs are being flushed into seas and rivers .

"Prominent civil activist Cornel West has been arrested in Ferguson, Missouri as more than 1,000 people march through the city to rally against police violence.

This morning's march on the university campus - which was far larger than previous overnight marches in Ferguson - was the first of what was expected to be a series of acts of civil disobedience around the region on Monday, the New York Times reported.

"Brent Taylor, a 23-year teaching veteran, was ordered to review a hygiene course by the principal at Scootney Springs Elementary School . The parents of an 8-year-old student at a school in Washington state are unhappy after their son was ordered to unclog a toilet with his bare hands. The incident happened on November 6 at Scootney Springs Elementary School in the small city of Othello. The third-grader said he reported the blocked toilet and teacher Brent Taylor told him to clear it with his hands. ‘It’s nothing I haven’t done before,’ Taylor reportedly told the student. Artie and Lisa Adams said they learned of the incident when they asked their son about his day at school. ‘He said everything was good, but my teacher made me put my hand inside the toilet. We were like, “What?’” Artie Adams told KEPR. The parents complained and the school principal reprimanded Taylor and ordered the 23-year teaching veteran to review a hygiene course. Taylor had taken the same course just two months ago. He also received a warning letter. Othello Superintendent George Juarez has said he stands by the principal's decision and he doesn’t plan to investigate the incident further. The Adams family are unhappy at what they consider to be too lax a punishment. ‘He did get made fun of, kids did see this happen and he’s not going to go to that school,’ Lisa Adams told KEPR. The boy has since transferred to another school. Artie and Lisa Adams are unhappy after teacher Brent Taylor ordered their 8-year-old son to unclog a toilet with his bare hands .

"A German religious forum took an unexpected turn yesterday when three topless protesters had to be dragged out of the building. The Berlin Islam Week event, held in one of the city's town halls, was stopped in its tracks by members of extreme protest group Femen, who charged into the hall with slogans attacking 'religious oppression' and Sharia law daubed on their bodies. Photographs from the moment the women were dragged out by policemen show a bemused-looking woman filming the event on her phone as unimpressed guests look on. Disturbance: One of the three Femen protesters is held on the ground by a policeman as a woman records the event on her phone . Protest: Three protesters from Femen stormed the stage at Berlin's Islam Week event . 'Dialogue': The women were dragged out of the event, at a Berlin town hall, after revealing their stridently anti-Islam views . Other images show the three on stage during a discussion, where speakers were confronted with the messages written on their bodies and also on banners which they waved above their heads while shouting. Femen, which began in Eastern Europe, is notorious for using nudity to promote their message of female emancipation and protest against governments and organisations with which they disagree. Berlin Islam Week is open to atheists and those of other religions as well as Muslims, according to promotional material, which describes the event as 'an important part of inter-religious dialogue process '. The description says this year's event aimed to 'provide a platform for exchange and to strengthen dialogue' and mentioned talks with 'religious, inter-religious , social and historical themes.' A spokesman for the event said that guests reacted 'appropriately' to the 'act of provocation' and continued the event afterwards. Coverage: The group has generated significant attention in recent years with its topless protest . Disruption: The three women, one of whom was said to have once been a Muslim herself, complained about Sharia law and 'religious oppression' Event: Berlin Islam Week is said to be a platform for discussion between religions . Following the event, Femen posted a statement online which attacked the Muslim system of law and claimed that the event was part of a culture which 'is responsible for many crimes'. It said: 'Femen is outraged that the city of Berlin offered a public platform and support to the community that openly spreads inhuman ideology and calls for violence and incitement...' 'Femen calls western government [sic], do not ignore the fact that the violent form of Islam found its niche in the western democratic society. It operates in the parallel world in the midst of our society and is responsible for many crimes.' 'We want to encourage all women to free themselves from patriarchal structures! You are worth as much as your fathers and brothers, you have a right to physical integrity, you have a right to make your own decisions, you have a right to self-determination, to love and freedom!' Following the event, a spokesman for Berlin Islam Week told MailOnline: 'Although [the protest] was intended as an act of deliberate . provocation, we did not defer to it. 'The audience, mainly from the Muslim . community, reacted to the disturbance appropriately, so that we all were very . quickly able to eventually continue the program of the Islam Week.' Femen has described it aims as 'fighting patriarchy in its three manifestations - sexual exploitation of women, dictatorship and religion.' Posts: After the event, Femen attacked the Berlin local government for lettings its buildings be used for Islam Week . Dragged out: Femen has often courted controversy by disrupting events with its messages . History: A Femen protester can be seen here last year confronting Vladimir Putin and Angela Merkel . The group has shot to fame in recent years after sending its topless activists to disrupt high-profile events and political leaders. Last year Russian president Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were confronted with a topless protester at a trade fair in Hanover. In September Femen members caused further controversy by storming the catwalk at Paris Fashion Week during a show by designer Nina Ricci. More recently, the group, which was founded by a Ukrainian, has mounted protests outside the Crimean parliament in Simferopol after the referendum which saw the region transferred from Ukraine to Russia.","Three protesters disrupted the event in a Berlin town hall yesterday .

"Zinedine Zidane has been suspended from coaching for three months as a consequence of not having the required Level 3 qualification demanded by Spanish authorities. The former World Cup winner served as Carlo Ancelotti's assistant with the Real Madrid first team in 2013 before taking charge of the Castilla B team, although his assistant Santiago Sanchez was named as head coach. However, following an official complaint lodged with the country's football federation, Competition Committee judge Francisco Rubio has decided to ban Zidane and Sanchez from coaching for three months. Zinedine Zidane has been handed a three-month ban from coaching Real Madrid's B team . The Frenchman has complained at his treatment after Spanish authorities lodged an official complaint . Zidane acted as Carlo Ancelotti's (R) first team assistant before taking charge of Castilla this season . Rubio accepted a complaint lodged by Miguel Galan, president of Spain's national training center for football coaches. Madrid announced in June that Zidane, who played at the club from 2001 until retiring in 2006, would coach its reserve team this season. However, Galan complained that Zidane lacked the appropriate qualifications to do so, and Rubio agreed. The former Madrid star currently carries a UEFA A Licence, equivalent to a Level 2 qualification. He escaped a six-month ban but must now obtain the 3rd level of his French coaching qualifications by April 2015. The 42-year-old had previously complained at the treatment he has received over the matter. He told Le Figaro: 'I have no regrets about having taken my qualifications in France. It's still amazing that there are also so few people to defend me and explain that I did not have special privilege. 'I did not circumvent the difficulty - but some took the opportunity to spit on me.' Zidane scores the winning goal for Real Madrid with a memorable volley in the 2002 Champions League final . Zidane was fined and banned for three games after headbutting Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup final . It is not the first time that the Frenchman has fallen foul of authorities - having been banned for three games and fined £3,260 following his infamous headbutt on Italy defender Marco Materazzi that saw him sent off in the 2006 World Cup final. Real Madrid have 10 working days to appeal against the decision with the Competition Committee’s appeals tribunal, and could also be taken to Spain’s Administrative Court for Sport. As a final resort, an appeal could be made to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In response to the sanction handed down by the Competition Committee to the Real Madrid Castilla's head coach and second coach, Santiago Sánchez and Zinedine Zidane respectively, Real Madrid C. F. would like to outline the following: . 1. The club's absolute disagreement with the decision, not least of all because Zinedine Zidane has been authorised by the French Football Federation to work as a head coach in the category Real Madrid Castilla currently find themselves in, as the certificate issued by said Federation from 13 October 2014 states. 2. Real Madrid will pursue every available legal avenue so that this decision is overturned.","Zinedine Zidane has been banned from coaching Real Madrid's B team .

"Prawn lovers face paying much higher prices this Christmas because of a global shortage. Stocks of cold-water prawns have plunged and wholesale prices have risen 40 per cent in recent weeks. This is partly due to cold weather in Canada and Greenland earlier in the year, which hindered trawlers, and follows a huge reduction in catches over the past three years. Prawn lovers face paying much higher prices this Christmas because of a global shortage . Experts warn prices will continue to rise for several months.

"Sunderland fans who made the 630-mile round trip to see their side humiliated 8-0 by Southampton are set to receive just £24 each in compensation from the players. In the aftermath of their embarrassing defeat, goalkeeper Vito Mannone vowed to speak to his team-mates about refunding the 2,600 supporters who made the journey. Many had paid £152.50 for a return train ticket, but they are set to receive just £24 to cover the cost of the ticket for the game and not their rail fare. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gus Poyet label the defeat the most embarrassing of his career . Sunderland fans were left stunned as their side was thrashed 8-0 by Southampton on Saturday . Sunderland had already subsidised away tickets – which originally cost £34 – to save each supporter £10 as part of their Away Supporters’ Initiative. The logistics of working out how much each fan was owed depending on how they got to St Mary’s Stadium would prove too complicated to refund them for travel. The worst moment of the afternoon was when Santiago Vergini scored one of the own goals of the season with a first-time volley, from the edge of the box, past his own goalkeeper. That goal, in only the 12th minute, set the tone for the game before Sunderland capitulated to one of the worst defeats in Premier League history. Graziano Pelle celebrates the fifth goal with Dusan Tadic as Southampton ran riot . But the defender has apologised to the club’s supporters and admitted his mistake had a huge impact on the way the game went. Vergini said: ‘I take full responsibility for this and after my error the game really did change. ‘The account we gave of ourselves was embarrassing. We have to look forward now and try to improve for the following game. ‘I thank the fans for their excellent support as always and I would really like to say sorry to them for the very poor account we have given of ourselves. ‘The first step is to accept the errors we committed and we have to be aware that we are responsible for what happened here.’","Sunderland were hammered 8-0 by Southampton at the weekend .

"'Painful lessons': Twenty-year-old Aimee Costello (pictured) died after taking the former legal high M-Cat on a night out last year . A coroner issued a stark warning today about the 'savage legacy' of a former legal high known as M-Cat after a young woman died from taking the drug. Aimee Costello, 20, snorted the class B drug after drinking vodka and Red Bull on a night out. The following day, she complained that her heart 'felt funny' before collapsing and dying. Two of her former friends were handed suspended prison sentences today after they admitted supplying her the drug, which is also called mephedrone. Assistant Deputy Coroner Kevin McLoughlin recorded a verdict of non-dependent abuse of drugs and warned: 'Inquests can draw painful lessons from tragedy and I hope this tragic story does that. 'I hope the lesson here is that these people seemed to have no appreciation that their actions were putting themselves at risk. 'Other people tempted to take M-Cat must realise that they might not be alive at the end of the day. 'Young people can be very cavalier about death, but their thoughts may change if they know the devastating effects Aimee's death has left upon her family. 'It is indeed a savage legacy.' An inquest in Leeds, West Yorkshire, heard that the night before her death on April 4 last year , Aimee had gone to a friend's house, where the two had drunk vodka and red bull before going out to a club. At around 2am, Aimee arrived at Jessica Hooks's house where another friend, Kirstie McInnes, was already there. The four snorted M-Cat, which was initially distributed as a so-called legal high before it was banned in 2010 following calls from campaigners. Hooks told the inquest yesterday: 'In the afternoon, she kept saying that her heart felt funny. She was catching her breath. 'At around 5.30pm we were just sitting round watching TV when Aimee just flopped down. At first, we thought she was joking, but then she started fitting. 'I grabbed her and she just flopped. She went really grey. I think she was unconscious. 'We all just freaked out. We laid her on the floor. Kirstie rang for an ambulance and they were telling her how to do CPR.' Scroll down for video . Friends: Jessica Hooks (left) has pleaded guilty to supplying a class B drug and Kirstie McInnes (right) has admitted to the concern and supply of a class B drug . An ambulance was called and despite . working on Aimee for half-an-hour she did not respond, so they took her . to St James's Hospital, where she was met by her frantic mother, who had . been informed. She was pronounced dead at 8.40pm. A court heard today that after Aimee's death, Hooks began to clear the house of evidence, ringing the dealer to come and collect the rest of his supply, which he did. But her 'unsophisticated' efforts did not stop police from finding the drugs bag and 'glossy catalogues' which had been used to snort the drugs. Hooks also sent a text to another friend who had been at the party, asking them to 'get Aimee's phone', but the police had already arrived and seized the phone along with other evidence. The pair later gave statements to the police claiming the drugs had arrived with Aimee. Warning: Aimee complained that her 'heart felt funny' the day after drinking vodka and snorting M-Cat . Jonathan Sharp, prosecuting, said that after further investigations both defendants were arrested and made full admissions. Hooks, 21, pleaded guilty to supplying a . class B drug and McInnes, 22, admitted to the concern and supply of a . class B drug. Both also admitted perverting the course of justice. They sobbed in the dock as they were handed prison sentences of ten and six months respectively, both suspended for 18 months, at Leeds Crown Court. Judge Geoffrey Marson QC told them: 'If ever a case demonstrated the dangerousness of even class B drugs this is it. 'Many people seem to think that drugs like this, of the M-cat genre, are harmless. They are dangerous. And as this case demonstrates they can kill.' A statement released by Aimee's parents Phillip and Heather after the case said: 'We have recently had the first anniversary of our beautiful youngest daughter Aimee and we are still in shock and disbelief that she is gone. 'To say we are devastated is an understatement and the thought that we will never see her again has left us broken. 'The loss of our bright, bubbly and loving girl has ripped our family apart and we, her sisters, and wider family, will never recover from it. 'She is our first thought on waking and our last thought before sleep. She was a beautiful, fun-loving and caring girl who we miss very much. 'We hope that Aimee's death will serve as a warning against so-called party drugs as they can kill just as easily as drugs that are traditionally regarded as dangerous.'","Aimee Costello collapsed after taking former legal high after a night out .

"A prehistoric sea creature that swam the oceans almost 250 million years ago has been dug up near Shanghai in China. It's believed to be the first amphibious ichthyosaur - reptiles that could live both in and out of the water - filling an important gap in evolution. The predators roamed Earth at the time of the dinosaurs and moved to the water after starting out as land creatures. A prehistoric fossil has been found at the Yangtze River near Shanghai. An expert says it could be the first amphibious ichthyosaur (illustrated). These were reptiles that could live both in and out of the water. If confirmed it would fill an important gap in evolution. The predators roamed Earth at the time of the dinosaurs . However, there were no fossils marking this transition until the new species was unearthed. The ancient marine reptile, with seal-like flippers, may have been adapted to life on the land as well as in the sea, scientists believe. Its relatives were dolphin-like creatures that swam in the oceans at the time of the dinosaurs. They are thought to have had terrestrial ancestors, but previously no fossils had come to light marking the transition of ichthyosaurs from land to sea. The Permian-Triassic extinction, which occurred around 250 million years ago, was one of the biggest catastrophes that caused a majority of the land and aquatic species to become extinct and is more commonly known as the 'Great Dying'. The causes that triggered the event have remained a mystery. Some scientists have suggested the mass extinction was caused by an asteroid strike or a volcanic eruption in the area now known as Siberia. They claim this led to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions and caused the mass extinction of Earth’s species. Research from earlier this year, however, suggested that microbes began belching out the greenhouse gas methane - which is about 20 per cent more potent than carbon dioxide. These fumes could have suddenly spurted from the oceans and wiped out the huge number of animals. Whatever the cause, the event is known to have wiped out 96 per cent of species on Earth. Today, all life is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. 'Now we have this fossil showing the transition,' said lead scientist Professor Ryosuke Motani, from the University of California. At 1.5ft (0.46 metres) long, Cartorhynchus lenticarpus was also the smallest known ichthyosaur. Ichthyosaurs - meaning fish-lizards - ranged greatly in size and could grow up to 30ft (nine metres) long. Superficially they resembled today's dolphins and whales. They were very different to Cartorhynchus with sharp teeth in long jaws and big eyes. They had four crescent-shaped fins, a stabilising dorsal fin and a fish-like tail with two lobes. Its fossil remains were dated from the start of the Trisassic period about 248 million years ago and were found in Chaohu near the Yangtze River about 150 miles (240km) from Shanghai in China. As well as big flippers, Cartorhynchus had flexible wrists which would have been essential for movement on the ground. While most ichthyosaurs have long beak-like snouts, the new specimen possessed a short nose that may have been adapted to suction feeding. Its body also contained thicker bones than other ichthyosaurs. This supports the theory that most marine reptiles that left the land first grew heavier to help them swim through rough coastal waves. The fossil remains were dated from the start of the Trisassic period about 248 million years ago and were found in Chaohu near the Yangtze River about 150 miles (240km) from Shanghai in China (shown) Called Cartorhynchus lenticarpus it is the smallest known ichthyosaur. The fossil (shown) dates back 248 million years, four million years after the 'Great Dying' mass extinction event that wiped out 96% of species. These animals moved to the water after being land creatures but until now no fossil marked this transition . The animal lived about four million years after the worst mass extinction in history, shedding light on how life on Earth survived. The Permian-Triassic extinction, known as the 'Great Dying', wiped out 96 per cent of all species and may have been linked to global warming. Scientists have wondered how long it took for animals and plants to recover after such destruction - particularly since the extinction was associated with global warming and ocean acidification. Understanding how reptiles such as this survived could be important for our own future, according to Professor Motani. 'This was analogous to what might happen if the world gets warmer and warmer,' he said. 'How long did it take before the globe was good enough for predators like this to reappear? 'In that world, many things became extinct, but it started something new. These reptiles came out during this recovery.'","A prehistoric fossil has been found at the Yangtze River near Shanghai .

"A devout Christian bed and breakfast owner who refused a bed to a gay couple was today ordered to pay them more than £3000 in compensation. Michael Black, 64, and his partner John Morgan, 59, began a legal battle soon after they were told they could not sleep together at the £75-a-night Swiss Bed and Breakfast in Cookham, Berkshire in March 2010. Owner Susanne Wilkinson told a court she was serious about her Christian beliefs and had also stopped unmarried heterosexual couples from sharing a double bed. Case: Gay couple Michael Black, 62 and John Morgan, 56, from Brampton, Cambridgeshire, pictured after their court victory yesterday, had their address posted online . Disagreement: Christians Susanne and Mike . Wilkinson refused to let gay couple Michael Black and John Morgan share a . room at their B&B . But a judge at Reading County Court ordered her to pay £3,600 in damages for discriminating directly against the couple, who have been together for eight years. Michael and John’s claim, funded by pressure group Liberty, was made under the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007 and argued that it was unlawful for a person providing services to the public to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation. Michael and John’s claim was made under the new Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007, which outlaws discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities, services, education and public functions on the grounds of sexual orientation. So, for example, a shopkeeper cannot refuse to sell goods to someone because they are gay. Previously, it was legal to refuse to serve homosexuals. In 2009 registrar Lillian Ladele, who refused to conduct civil partnership ceremonies because they were against her Christian beliefs, was ruled to have broken the law by Appeal Court judges. The landmark case was the most important legal test yet in the struggle between Christians and the gay rights lobby. In 2010 Chris Grayling, then Shadow Home Secretary but now Justice Secretary in the Coalition Cabinet, said Christian bed and breakfast owners . should be allowed to turn away homosexual couples. The Shadow . Home Secretary said that while hotels should not discriminate against . gays, Christians should be able to refuse anyone who offended their . faith from entering their homes, prompting a backlash. After the ruling Mrs Wilkinson, who lives with husband Mike, said: 'Naturally, my husband and I are disappointed to have lost the case and to have been ordered to pay £3,600 in damages for injury to feelings. 'We have the option to appeal and we will give that serious consideration. 'We believe a person should be free to act upon their sincere beliefs about marriage under their own roof without living in fear of the law. 'Equality laws have gone too far when they start to intrude into a family home. 'People’s beliefs about marriage are coming under increasing attack and I am concerned about people’s freedom to speak and act upon these beliefs. 'I am a Christian, not just on a Sunday in church, but in every area of my life - as Jesus expects from his followers. 'That’s all I was trying to do and I think it’s quite wrong to punish me for that especially after enduring over two years of vile abuse and threats. 'We find this a strange justice in a society that aspires to be increasingly tolerant.' Mrs Wilkinson's legal costs were paid by The Christian Institute, a national charity that endeavours to protect the civil liberty of Christians. Spokesperson Mike Judge said: 'Mrs Wilkinson’s B&B is a business but it’s also a family home. 'The law should be more flexible in allowing people to live according to their own values under the own roof. Scene: The Swiss Bed & Breakfast property in Cookham, owned by Mr & Mrs Wilkinson, that was caught up in the discrimination row . 'A bit more balance is needed rather than allowing one set of rights to automatically suppress another.' In 2008 civil partners Martin Hall and Steven Paddy launched a county court claim against Peter and Hazelmary Bull, the owners of the Chymorvah Private Hotel in Cornwall. They won £3,600 in damages because their human rights were breached by the guesthouse’s refusal to give them a double room, but the case is now going to appeal at the Supreme Court. Peter and Hazelmary Bull were ordered to pay £3,600 to a gay couple they would not let stay in their guesthouse, but are now taking their battle to the Supreme Court .

"A Grinch of a gunman is still on the loose one year after shooting a man dressed as Santa in the back. Last Christmas Eve, Xavier Hawkins of Washington D.C. put on a Santa suit to hand out toys to needy children at an annual event sponsored by Toys for Tots and his then-employer, Interstate Moving. He was just approaching the children when, while he was on camera being filmed by a local news station, he was shot in the back with a pellet gun. Scroll down for video .

Aftermath: Though the pellet gun did not cause physical harm to Hawkins, he suffered from PTSD in the aftermath, and the gunman is still on the loose . Hawkins can then be seen groaning as he falls to the ground, while one child looks on in horror. Now, Hawkins is telling ABC 7, the news team that was there when this horrific event occurred, how difficult his year has been since this shooting. 'When I felt the burning, I knew I was shot. That first instinct in my mind before I said anything was I'm going to die,' he said. And while the physical injuries were manageable for Hawkins, the emotional and psychological ones were not in the aftermath of this incident. Back at it: Despite what happened, Hawkins says he will still dress up as Santa this year . 'I thought people were out to get me. Why did somebody shoot me? Are they following me?' he said. He eventually was forced to leave his job, and a doctor diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder. 'I try to think back and look at it and the reality is, I could have been dead,' he said. These days, Hawkins is back to volunteering and helping out those less fortunate though, dedicating all his time to helping out st his church and its daycare center. And he's even getting ready to put the Santa costume back on to pass out gifts at church this year.","Xavier Hawkins was shot in the back with a pellet gun on Christmas Eve last year as he passed out toys to needy children dressed as Santa Claus .

"Police had 'three contacts' with suspect Elliot Rodger before a mass shooting on Friday night in Isla Vista that left seven dead and thirteen injured.

Rodger also . called police on July 31, 2013 and claimed to be the victim of assault, . Brown said, though police believe Rodger may have actually been the aggressor. No charges were filed. Attorney Alan Shifman earlier told reporters that the Rodger family called police several weeks ago after being alarmed by YouTube videos 'regarding suicide and the killing of people' that Rodger had been posting. Police interviewed Rodger and found him to be a 'perfectly polite, kind and wonderful human,' but noted that he had few friends and no girlfriend, he added. Police did not find a history of guns. Rodger downplayed his family's concerns for his mental state, saying he was having difficulties with his social life and was planning to drop out of Santa Barbara City College. The responding deputies gave him some advice and information on where to seek help, and left. In a 140-page manifesto, Rodger described in detail the day police knocked his door. 'I had the striking and devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what I was planning to do, and reported me for it,' he wrote. The 22-year-old expressed fear that officers would search his home and find his multiple firearms and writings outlining his plans, and stop him from exacting revenge n his 'enemies' by locking him up. The officers, however, found the suspect ‘courteous and shy,’ and left. Rodger allegedly stabbed his three . roommates before he went on a shooting spree in his BMW and killed six people and injuring thirteen. He was found dead due to a gunshot wound in his vehicle.

'Tomorrow is the day of retribution, the day in which I will have my revenge against humanity,' Rodger says in the video. 'Against all of you. For the last eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, I’ve been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires. All because girls have never been attracted to me.' 'I will punish all of you for it,' he later says in the video before laughing.  'On the day of retribution, I am going to enter the hottest sorority house of UCSB and I will slaughter every single spoiled, stuck-up blond slut I see inside there. All those girls that I’ve desired so much. They would have all rejected me and looked down upon me as an inferior man if I ever made a sexual advance towards them. While they throw themselves at these obnoxious brutes.' Later in the video, Rodger goes on to describe himself as 'the superior one' and 'the true alpha male.'

"They are the feminists famous for staging topless protests, with Vladimir Putin, Paris Fashion Week and Germany's Next Top Model among those treated to a bare-breasted display. Now founder member and leader of FEMEN France, Inna Shevchenko, 23, has thrown open the doors of the organisation's Paris HQ to a British film crew. Shevchenko, who was given political asylum in France last year, has masterminded the expansion of the feminist organisation, adding branches in Canada, Germany and Israel to the original Ukrainian movement. Scroll down for video . Protest: Shevchenko leads a FEMEN protest in Paris against Government plans to toughen abortion laws . But despite catapulting the movement to international prominence, Shevchenko says much more still needs to be done. 'When they ask me how [FEMEN] started, I say I have a big reason because I was born as a woman in this time and in this society,' she elaborates. 'And at some point, you look around and you understand that you don't want to . live like your mother, you don't want to live like your aunt, you don't . want to live like your neighbours. 'You want something different but you . don't know what because no one told you that there was something different. 'At the beginning it was just anger inside and we still keep it inside and it's growing with every new action - it's growing.' Militant: Shevchenko at FEMEN's Paris HQ and right, taking a chainsaw to a wooden cross in central Kiev . Leaders: Inna (centre) with fellow FEMEN leaders, Sacha Shevchenko (left) and Oksana Shachko (right) 'Actions' over the last year have included an angry protest against violence during a pro-Russian rally in the Crimean city of Simferopol, mobbing Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan during a visit to a polling station and interrupting anti-abortion rallies in Canada and Spain. Other targets have included Russia's President Putin (still a favourite), religious groups of all denominations and prostitution. Shevchenko herself is no stranger to any of them, and is regularly to be found in the thick of the action, topless and daubed with painted slogans. 'We're using topless style of protest to show that women are protesting,' she explains of the group's famous bare-breasted protests. The method even extends to the internet with Putin (yes, him again) becoming the target of a slew of topless photos, each featuring the legend: 'F*** YOU PUTIN!' It's an approach that can sometimes prove controversial, as Shevchenko herself knows only too well after being forced to flee Ukraine following a stunt that provoked the ire of authorities and church groups alike.

"Defiant: Portugal's Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho defied calls for him to resign last night following the resignation of several key coalition government figures in a row over austerity measures . Portugal's financial markets nosedived today amid fears that repayments on its £64billion bailout could soon become unsustainable as the government looked set to collapse following a spat over the country's austerity programme. Share prices dropped by around six per cent in early trading alarming investors and reigniting concerns that the eurozone's strategy for dealing with the financial crisis is flawed. The market dip came as Portuguese Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho defied calls to resign last night after the resignations of key ministers in a spat over austerity. Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo Portas, . the leader of the junior party in the center-right coalition . government, quit on Tuesday in protest against plans to continue with . tax hikes and pay and pension cuts. The previous day, Finance Minister Vitor . Gaspar walked out, saying he lacked political and public support for his . austerity strategy. Portugal is locked into a program of tough budget cuts demanded by its fellow euro countries, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund in return for a 78 billion euro (£66 billion) bailout two years ago. Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President, said he was following the situation 'with concern'. Leaders of the 17 European Union nations that share the euro currency, known as the eurozone, have insisted on cuts in countries like Portugal that have a heavy debt burden. But Portugal is now facing the likely prospect of austerity-inspired strife of the kind that has dogged Greece and compelled it to ask for a second bailout. As well as drawing criticism from opposition parties, trade unions and business leaders, the austerity program has been a drag on Portugal's economy and unemployment is stuck at 17.6 percent. Drop: Portugal's main PSI 20 stock index plunged 6.4 per cent to 5,177 in late morning trading Wednesday . Outcry: Portugal's strict austerity measures following the bailout has sparked protest in the past including the 'Invasion of the Parliament', pictured, back in October last year . If Portugal doesn't abide by the . austerity program, its bailout creditors could halt the disbursement of . funds, potentially leaving it unable to pay what it owes. Worried: European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said he is watching developments in Portugal with 'concern' That . development 'could trigger a sovereign default and potential removal . from the eurozone, with contagion spreading across to Greece, a country . that is currently struggling to secure its next tranche of aid money,' Ishaq Siddiqi of ETX Capital said today. Portugal's main PSI 20 stock index plunged 6.4 per cent to 5,177 in late morning trading Wednesday. Another indicator of investor confidence in a country, the interest rate on Portugal's benchmark 10-year bond, hit 7.39 per cent - up from 5.23 per cent in May but nonetheless lower than the 9.77 per cent it was at this time last year. Passos Coelho, the prime minister, said in a nationally televised address that he will fight to keep his Cabinet together, 'but resolving the problem doesn't only depend on me.' He said he will speak to Portas, head of the Popular Party, in an attempt to resolve their differences. Portas did not say whether he would pull his party out of the government - a step which would leave Passos Coelho without the majority in Parliament he needs to enact his policies. Antonio Seguro, leader of the main opposition Socialist Party who has called for new elections, was due to meet later Wednesday with President Anibal Cavaco Silva. The head of state has the power to dissolve Parliament and call a ballot, though he has expressed reluctance to take that course.","Portugal's main stock index plunged by more than six per cent this morning .

"British mum Rachel Rounds caused quite a stir by announcing the reason her husband still fancied her is because he didn't attend the birth of their child. As someone who specialises in advising people on sex and relationships, I am obviously going to champion the benefits of sex. But I'm also fully aware there are times when sex - very necessarily - gets put on the backburner and takes not just second, but last place on the priority list. Scroll down for video . Tracey says that when it comes to labour, women need their partners support more than ever and it is cowardly for partners to opt out of going to the birth of their child . If you're grieving the loss of a parent, stressed to death at work, sick or surviving on one hour's sleep a week with a screaming baby, who the hell even thinks about having sex, let alone makes the effort? I'd also suggest that when your partner is writhing in agony giving birth, bargaining with Satan to sell her soul in return for just one minute's break from the pain of pushing a watermelon-sized object through a space the size of an orange, this is also not a time when thinking about your sex life is foremost in your mind. Most women are terrified giving birth. Not just a little bit nervous but paralysed with fear. Isn't this the one time when it really should be all about you? Tracey says that men aren't the only ones who have to move past the gory aftermath of childbirth . Imagine this scenario: You're being wheeled into the labour ward, petrified, and your partner - the person who is supposed to love and support you though sickness and health and surely through giving bloody birth - hangs back and says, 'Um, honey. Actually, do you mind if I sit this one out? I know you're about to experience the worst pain imaginable but it might put me off having sex the next time we have it'. Would you look him in the eyes, take his hand and say, 'Of course I understand. Come back when the baby's been washed and powdered and I've got my make-up on and in a sexy nightie.' Or would you use your last minute of cohesive thought to call a divorce lawyer and invite them into the delivery room so you can sign the papers in between pushing out the baby? Call me callous but think I'd be going for option two. Tracey says that when it comes to the birth of your child, sex should be the last thing on your mind . Of course it's going to be traumatic for men when her ladybits - usually a source of pleasure - suddenly transform into something that causes pain and are, indisputably, not at their most attractive. Get over it. Men aren't the only ones who have to move past the gory mess that is childbirth and go back to thinking of the vagina as somewhere that nice things happen. Women have to deal with it, too. Women also have to deal with rather a lot of other things to do with pregnancy and birth in order to feel like sex again. Shifting the baby weight and trying to feel sexy three sizes larger than they were, coming to grips with stretch marks and a body that's shifted and changed after lugging around a baby for months aren't exactly easy to move past. Neither is trying to find the motivation to have sex after having had one hour's sleep a week for the last four months. I get the argument for men not watching the birth. I've read the letters I get from men saying there are ramifications and it does take a while for those images to disappear and for him to reconcile what's happened before enjoying sex again. But, seriously, surely it's not too much to ask that men are grown up enough to be able to rationalise that the vagina has two functions: one for pleasure and one to deliver babies? After all, you pee out of your penis and also have sex with that. There appears to be no problem with mentally compartmentalising there. Why can't you do the same with her vagina? I'm not unsympathetic to men in relation to their experience of pregnancy, birth and parenting. I know lots of men feel sidelined by it all and like someone stole their wife after the baby is born. Men have told me it feels like they're replaced and that they suddenly lost their best friend, partner and sex partner and in her place was a woman who seems there purely to service the child. But she's been the one to have to put up with periods, pregnancy and birth and will shoulder the lion's share of the parenting. Surely it's not too much to ask for you to be able to cope with a little blood and messiness, to be by her side when she most needs you?

"The mother of the two Chechnyan brothers suspected of setting off two bombs at the Boston Marathon was arrested last year for allegedly stealing $1,600 worth of clothes from an upscale department store. Zubeidat K. Tsarnaeva, 45, was charged with two counts of malicious/wanton damage and defacement to property after allegedly swiping the merchandise from a Lord & Taylor in Natick, Mass. in June 2012. She also spoke today to proclaim that her son's didn't plant the bombs and that they are ''100 per cent innocent.' Scroll down for video . Zubeidat K. Tsarnaeva, mother of the terrorist suspect brothers Dzokhar and Tamerlan, said her sons' are '100 per cent innocent' Zubeidat K. Tsarnaeva's two sons have been accused of planting the two bombs that exploded at the Boston Marathon on Monday. She was arrested last year for allegedly shoplifting from a Lord & Taylor . Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev is still on the loose after being identified as one of the Boston Marathon bombers . Tamerlan Tsarnaev attended Bunker Hill Community College . and was studying to become an engineer but took a year off to pursue . boxing. He is a two-time Golden Glove champion . 'This is a set up, my son would never ever carry out such terror attack,' she said Friday. She went on to say: 'FBI knew everything what my son was doing, told me he was serious leader, that they were afraid of him.' Mrs Tsarnaeva went on to say that Dzhokhar was raised in the US and . insisted that 'no one ever talked about terror' in their house. She stole $1,624 in women's clothes, according to a Patch.com story. Her sons allegedly left two bombs, packed with ball bearings and other materials, near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday. The terror attack left three dead and 183 injured. They were captured on CCTV by a different Lord & Taylor store on Boylston Street. The FBI released those CCTV images of the two brothers Thursday evening and later that night Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a shootout with law enforcement in Watertown, Mass. A police officer was shot dead near the campus for Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her other son, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is still on the run and considered by authorities to be armed and extremely dangerous. Law enforcement gather near the scene of the shootout that killed Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev late Thursday night . Tamerlan reportedly had a bomb strapped to his chest when he was killed while he and his brother robbed a 7-Eleven, tried to steal an SUV and threw explosives at police officers. They used the carjacking victim's debit car to withdraw $800 from an ATM. The entire city of Boston is on lock down with residents warned to stay indoors, public transport shut down and a no-fly zone around the city. A transit police officer was critically wounded in the exchange of gunfire with the suspects. Dzhokhar A Tsarnaev is believed to be a legal immigrant to the U.S., who arrived in the country one year ago from the Russian region of Chechnya which has been plagued by an Islamic insurgency stemming from separatist wars. The 19-year-old, who attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, is an amateur wrestling champion. The older brother attended Bunkerhill Community College and was studying to become an engineer but took a year off to pursue boxing. They reportedly entered the United States with family in 2002 or 2003 and Tamerlan became a legal permanent resident in 2007. The older brother Tamerlan attended Bunker Hill Community College and was studying to become an engineer but took a year off to pursue boxing. He is a two-time Golden Glove champion. This is one of the Boston bombing suspects, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, has been described as 'normal' by those who knew him . Dzhokhar was born in Kyrgyzstan. The family, which also included two daughters, Bella and Amina, had the status of refugees at the time they moved to Russia. Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev went to a school in Makhachkala, the capital city of the Republic of Dagestan, between 1999-2001. His former teachers at his first school described him as a 'normal child' today. ‘He arrived at our school in the first form and departed in the second,’ Irina Bandurina, the secretary at Makhachkala’s School No.1, told RT. Dzhokhar was born in Kyrgyzstan and was a successful wrestler in high school . ‘They arrived from Kyrgyzstan and departed to the US. I’m telling you they lived here for a year. Not the whole year. They arrived at the school in 2001 and departed in March 2002 … There were four of them – two sisters and two brothers… It’s written here that they are from Kyrgyzstan.’ A friend of Dzokhar, Eric Machado told CNN the 19-year-old was just a 'normal American kid.' 'There was no evidence that would lead us to believe he was capable of any of this,' he said. An uncle of the Boston bombing suspects said who died early Friday morning said Tamerlan was a 'loser.' Ruslan Tsarni said that Tamerlan 'deserved it.' 'I wish they never existed,' Mr Tsarni, who lives in Maryland, told local Boston station WBZ. He had not spoken to the boys since 2009 and said that he did not recognize them when he saw the photos released by the FBI on Thursday evening. 'I'm wordless... shocked,' Mr Tsarni said. 'They do not deserve to exist on this earth.' Ruslan called Tamerlan a 'loser', he described his younger nephew Dzhokhar as a quiet kid. The suspects' uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, spoke to the media and implored his nephew on the run to turn himself in. He also railed against his relatives for bringing shame on their family and country . Anzor Tsarnaev, father of the two suspects, said his boys 'could never have done this' These CCTV images were released Thursday evening by the FBI. Tamerlan engaged in a shootout with law enforcement later that night and died . One of their sisters, who lives in New Jersey, said, 'They were great people. I never would have expected it. 'They are smart – I don’t know what’s gotten into them,' adding that her younger brother is 'an amazing child.' The sister, who declined to give her name to the Newark Star-Ledger, said she sympathized with her brothers' victims. 'I’m not okay – no one is okay right now. I’m hurt for everyone who has been hurt. I’m sorry for all the people who are hurt and for all the people who lost their lives.' Several former classmates described Dzhokhar as a friendly, smart kid, and they said they were shocked that he was part of the pair who killed three and injured more than 180 in the marathon bombings on Monday. An unidentified friend told CNN that he 'hung out, went to parties, smoked some weed... its not like he's some foreign dude.' A different uncle, Alvi Tsarni, who lives closeby in Boston was visibly upset when he spoke about his nephews. 'I don't believe any of my nephews are involved in this horrible incident,' Alvi Tsarni told the Boston CBS affiliate WBZ. 'If he did this I'm sorry too. It's crazy, it's not possible. I can't believe it. Who can do this stuff?' The family tree is unclear, though the Associated Press spoke with the boys' father Anzor Tsamaev who lives in an area of Russia called Makhachkala. 'My son is a true angel,' Anzor said. 'Dzhokhar is a second-year medical student in the U.S. He is such an intelligent boy. We expected him to come on holidays here.' The boys' aunt, Maret, is a surgeon who lives in Canada. She used to be in Chechnya and her acts as a battlefield surgeon are described in a book.","Mom charged in June 2012 for shoplifting from the upscale department store .

"Obese patients and smokers face an immediate ban on routine operations according to a major NHS clinical commissioning group. Patients in Devon will be told today that if they have a body mass index of more than 35 (morbidly obese), they will be required to lose either five per cent of their weight or reduce their BMI to under 35 before they  undergo surgery. Smokers will have to have given up eight weeks before any planned operation in a bid to slash heath costs and improve clinical outcomes. The North Eastern and Western Devon Clinical Commissioning Group is one of the largest groups in the country hand as almost 900,000 patients served by 130 GP practices. Scroll down for video . Obese patients and smokers in Devon face an immediate ban on routine operations. People with a BMI of more than 35, they will be required to lose either five per cent of their weight or reduce their BMI to under 35. Smokers will be forced to prove they have quit for eight weeks before any operation (file image) In a statement it said: 'The CCG decided that for those patients undergoing hip and knee operations with a body mass index of more than 35 (morbidly obese) they patient would be required to have a BMI of under 35 or to lose five per cent of their weight before planned surgery, whichever is the lesser weight loss.' The new restrictions will be extended to all non-urgent surgical procedures, however, it will not apply to cancer treatment or urgent cases. The statement added: 'The CCG also confirmed that it would not be restricting IVF treatment or Caesarean sections on medical grounds at this time. 'The quit smoking and the BMI requirements will be introduced with immediate effect.' Patients who have already been given a date for surgery will not be affected by the policy change although they will be offered support in losing weight or quitting smoking. Dr Tim Burke, chair of the NEW Devon CCG said: 'All of these temporary measures relate to planned operations and treatments, not those which must be done as an emergency or to save lives. 'Clinicians have carefully reviewed a number of measures, taking into account the impacts of their temporary withdrawal to decide which we will implement. 'We recognise that each patient is an individual and where their GP or consultant feels that there are exceptional circumstances we will convene a panel of clinicians to consider the case. 'We will continue to keep people informed about our decisions around the measures.' Dr Burke said that he was being forced to curtail some services because the CCG is currently running a deficit of £14.5 million. The new restrictions imposed by the North Eastern and Western Devon Clinical Commissioning Group will affect all non-urgent surgical procedures, including hip and knee operations (file image) He said he was now going to restrict access to second hearing aids as well as certain expensive drugs. He said: 'Other measures encourage patients to take steps themselves to reduce their risks from surgery and to improve their outcomes, such as losing weight and stopping smoking. 'As part of the review we looked at how long a person should stop smoking for before surgery and based on that evidence we have increased the previously discussed time of six weeks to eight weeks. 'We don’t under estimate how difficult it will be for some people to lose weight or stop smoking and we will continue to support them. If they are able to do this it will also have long term health benefits for them. 'We are committed to being open about what we are considering and how the decisions are being made. We are publishing our decisions and producing information for the patients affected about the available treatment options for them. 'The CCG has a legal duty to live within its financial resources and the prioritisation of services is helping us to do that.' It is understood that the CCG is expecting a new range of cuts.","NHS chiefs have banned obese people and smokers from routine surgery .

"An Austrian girl has said she feels she 'can really be free' among the radicals of the so-called Islamic State, six months after leaving her her parents with a note saying she would die for Allah. Asked about the routine of life in IS stronghold Raqqa, Sabina Selimovic, 15, said: 'I like to eat. The food here is very similar to Austria even if it's mainly halal food. 'But you can get ketchup here, Nutella and cornflakes.' Scroll down for video . A picture believed to show Sabina Selimovic, 15, with jihadi fighters in Syria: An interview given by the Austrian teenager saying how she feels 'she can really be free' among the extremists may have been given at gunpoint . Don't look for us. We will serve Allah – and we will die for him': Samra Kesinovic, 17, left, and Sabina, right, left the Austrian capital in April leaving a note for their parents explaining they had gone to join the jihad in Syria . Austrian anti-terror agents believe the interview given by Sabina, who is now married to a jihadi fighter, was probably carried out at gunpoint. Weeks earlier friends and family of Sabina said she had told them in online conversations she regretted leaving Vienna for Syria and wanted to come home. Sabina and her friend Samra Kesinovic, 17, left the Austrian capital in April, leaving a note telling their parents they had gone to fight in Syria. They come from Bosnian refugee families who settled in Austria after the former Yugoslavia collapsed into ethnic warfare in the 1990. Born in Austria, it is believed they radicalised through a local mosque. But the later claim Sabina wanted to leave and come back to Austria had reportedly infuriated ISIS leaders, who are waging a constant propaganda war to attract new recruits. Anti-terrorism police in the girls' homeland said it is almost certain she would have been ordered to publicly disavow what she had said. It is believed both Samra and Sabina married IS fighters soon after arriving in Syria. The two couples initially lived in the same room but the 15-year-old has reportedly now moved out to a different flat. Speaking by SMS messages to French weekly Paris Match, Sabina denied claims she was pregnant and insisted she was enjoying life in Syria, where she felt free to practise her religion in a way that she did not in Austria. The magazine did manage to confirm the teenager had only been allowed to speak to them with the permission of her husband, who was in the room as she wrote her answers. She said after arriving to Turkey from Austria they crossed over the border into Syria on foot. They ended up in the city of Raqqa, she said, after arriving in the country with nothing other than the clothes they were wearing. Sabina said her husband was a soldier and added: 'Here I can really be free. I can practice my religion. I couldn't do that in Vienna.' Jihadi brides: The two girls in their new life in a pic they posted online . Looking over the Euphrates: Sabina said she and Samra had ended up in the Islamic State stronghold Raqqa . Radical chic: Sabina and Samra could be prosecuted if they do ever manage to return to Austria . In Vienna, experts who studied the transcript of Sabina's interview said it was almost certain she had been forced to speak to the magazine by her husband, who was a fighter in the ISIS-terrorist militia. The experts, who preferred to remain anonymous, said the story which went all round the world about the pair wanting to leave had done a lot of damage to the ISIS campaign. It was clear they were trying to put that right, the experts said. Sabina and Samra could be prosecuted if they do ever manage to return to Austria. Austrian police who are looking into the circumstances of the girl's disappearance have also compiled a dossier about the girls' links with terrorist groups. Before leaving the country Sabina and Samra had started lecturing schoolmates in Vienna about their lifestyle and were suspected behind a vandalism attack on their school calling for jihad. When they disappeared, their parents found notes in their bedrooms saying 'Don't look for us.

"The Manhattan madam accused of running a multimillion dollar prostitution empire from an Upper East Side apartment has been remanded in custody after a court heard her network of wealthy clients made her a 'significant flight risk'. Anna Gristina will remain in prison because a judge agreed that the 'high-worth individuals' she allegedly serviced might help her try to flee the United States to a safe haven. Gristina’s ‘black book’ of clients, . stretching back 15 years, contains the names of powerful figures in . politics, law enforcement, law, banking and entertainment, as well as . several ‘ultra-wealthy’ Europeans, say prosecutors. Prosecutors suggested they would be . likely attempt to stop embarrassing revelations about themselves coming . to light, rather let justice run its course. Charged: Anna Gristina, 44, appeared in Manhattan Supreme Court yesterday in a formal suit and glasses, a far cry from the sultry pose in the half-naked pictures with her husband . The court also heard that British-born Gristina, known in the industry as 'Anna Scotland', had a fund specially set up to help her flee justice. The 44-year-old, who appeared wearing handcuffs, managed only a weak smile to her husband in the gallery as she made a ten-minute appearance in Manhattan’s Supreme Court today, and blew him a kiss as she was led back to the cells. She also appeared anxious and tried to hide her face from photographers, according to DNAInfo. Wearing a herringbone pattern black and white jacket and black trousers, her blonde hair was unkempt and she looked more like a librarian than a wealthy vice madam. An indictment was also handed down today on the mother-of-four. She has pleaded not guilty to one count of prostitution in the third degree and will now face a trial. Husband of ten years Kelvin Gorr told the New York . Daily News as he left court today: 'We are just a great family... and my wife means everything . to me. I feel heartbroken.' It was also revealed today that authorities are investigating links between Gristina and a woman who worked as a recruiter for a high-end matchmaking service that pairs wealthy men with polished women, according to DNAInfo. Suspect: Jaynie Mae Baker, 30, is wanted by police for questioning as they believe she may have been involved in the prostitution ring . Jaynie Baker's profile on the VIP Life's website, for which she finds eligible wealthy bachelors . Jaynie Mae Baker, 30, from Brooklyn, who works for dating service VIP Life, is wanted by police for questioning. They believe she is an associate of Gristina. Her Facebook page says she co-hosted a fundraiser for a Texas-based animal shelter called Shelby Shelter with Gristina last year at a West Village night club. Anna Gristina's second husband Kelvin Gorr said he was 'heartbroken' as he left court today . The 30-year-old acts as a contractor who refers men to VIP Life, for which she receives a finder's fee. The agency only lists men who are serious about long-term relationships and shuns women who are only interested in men for their money. Founder of VIP Life Lisa Clampitt told DNAInfo Baker was a 'sweet young woman' who would never be involved in anything illegal. Vincent Parco, an investigator working for her legal team who was in court, said Gristina 'was running a marketing website and was meeting investors but it did not work out. Her husband is looking after the children and they are OK.' During the hearing Gristina’s lawyer Richard Siracusa sought to have the $3million she would have to post if she wanted bail - $1million in cash and a $2million surety - lowered in exchange for her wearing an ankle bracelet. So far she has not posted the huge sum and is being held in the notorious Riker’s Island prison in New York. Wealthy: The brothel was run from an East 78th Street apartment where residents said a steady stream of beautiful young women would come and go . Mr Siracusa said: 'My client has extremely high bail. She has no record, she has four children...she has a home for rescued animals. 'For someone who came into court charged with one count of criminal prostitution this is far in excess of what would be necessary to keep her coming back to court. 'The District Attorney has her passport...The $1m to $2m bail puts her in a special category as some one who is a heinous criminal and that carried over when she goes into the jails. 'It is not an easy existence there.' Peter Gleason, left, co-attorney for Anna Gristina who is charged with  promoting prostitution, is joined by private investigator Vincent Parco . Charles Linehan, prosecuting for the Manhattan District Attorney, told the court that 'the risk of flight is very high here' and that nothing had changed from Gristina’s last court appearance in February. He said: 'She has high-worth individuals she counts among her friends and clients that we believe have an interest in not having this case go forward and are in a position to help her flee the jurisdiction. 'We have evidence she has money squirreled away so that in the event of this happening she could use to flee the jurisdiction. The risk of flight is very high here.' He added that during a previous police investigation - apparently a reference to the 2008 prostitution bust which snared former New York governor Eliot Spitzer - she had fled to Montreal where she has an apartment. Kristin Davis, a New York madam who supplied Spitzer with prostitutes, has alleged it was the former governor himself who tipped off someone working for Gristina’s business, Fleur d’Elite, about a sting on escort agencies – prompting the British woman to flee temporarily to Canada. Linehan explained it was thought she would do the same ‘at the moment’ she was discovered, although she had been arrested before being able to do so. Judge Juan Merhcan agreed there was a 'significant' risk of her fleeing and ordered she remain in custody. He said: 'It seems that $2million bail and $1million cash is appropriate given the risk of flight so I am not going to modify the bail.' Gristina, a suburban soccer mom who moved to New York 20 years ago from her native Edinburgh, was arrested after a five-year investigation during which . undercover police taped more than 100 hours of audio where she bragged . about her high-end clients, how she had contacts in law enforcement who . would tip her off and even how she used underage girls for some of the . trysts, according to explosive court documents. The divorcee lives in suburban Monroe, north of New York City, with her children and a number of rescue animals. - Neighbour . The five-year-long investigation was run by a Manhattan district attorney's office unit that pursues cases against police and other uniformed city workers, according to a transcript of her February 23 arraignment. A co-defendant has yet to be arrested and has not been identified. During hundreds of hours of surveillance, Gristina was heard saying that 'she has connections in law enforcement who are poised to help her out, to let her know if there is trouble on the front that she needs to be concerned about', District Attorney Charles Linehan said, according to the court transcript. Neighbours say a steady stream of young women - usually of Eastern European descent - would come and go from the second-floor apartment, as did a number of suited business men. Jailed: Gristina is being held at Rikers Island prison on $2million bond and is considered a flight risk because she has a British passport and a home in Canada . Gristina boasted she had 'business contacts world-wide' which are thought to include powerful . politicians, top-law enforcement, influential lawyers, bankers, . entertainment execs and Fortune 500 businessmen, according to the New York Post. The . DA also said Gristina had not reported any income to the government in a . number of years so she will likely be charged with tax evasion as well. When . she was arrested on February 22, she was meeting with an unnamed investment . banker at his Morgan Stanley office for a meeting to try to raise money . to finance what prosecutors believe may be . an online start-up that would match prostitutes with wealthy men. Investigator Parco claimed she had been trying to set up a legitimate dating website aimed at rich clients. Morgan Stanley representatives did not immediately respond to an email on Monday evening. Prosecutors have up to 100 hours of . video and audio recordings in the case, which they cultivated through . informants and undercover operations, Linehan told the judge last month. Ex-husband: Dario Gristina, a Conservative Republican Candidate for NYS Assembly, said he divorced Anna years ago and knew nothing of the allegations. He has since remarried and has six children, left . Minors were involved in some of the encounters Gristina arranged, the prosecutor said. He cited information from at least one eyewitness account - a confidential informant who was one of Gristina’s prostitutes. Defence lawyers dismissed reports that she had provided underage girls as ‘disgusting’. According to the Daily News, the escort service offered clients a three-tiered pricing system. Costs . ranged from $1,000 for the 'Dream Model girls', $1,500 for 'Calendar . Girls, fashion models and budding actors', and $2,000 and up for the . 'Ultimate Elite Model' category. Mohammed Azad, 32, who owns a restaurant in the building where Gristina allegedly operated her brothel, told the Post: 'I see people in and out coming over . here, sometimes many in one day. I always see young . fashionable women, always under 30. They don’t live here.' Facebook post: Gristina reveals she has had an apartment in New York for the last 15 years - the length of time she is alleged to have been running the brothel . When police arrived at her upscale suburban home, no one was at home but a number of animals including pigs, pit bulls and wild boars were roaming around the property. On her Facebook page, she has many pictures of her pigs and often posts about them on other pig-lover's walls. In August last year, she wrote to one friend: 'I hate going to the city. I have had an apartment for 15 years and I only visit like once a month.' Her ex-husband Dario Gristina, a Conservative Republican Candidate for NYS Assembly, told the Daily News: 'We divorced a long time ago, I am surprised.' Italian-born Gristina married second wife Teresa ten years ago. He has six children but it is unclear how many of them are shared with his first wife. Do you know this woman?

"It has generally been agreed that northern Africa underwent desertification about 3 million years ago, leading to the formation of the Sahara. But now scientists at it may be twice as old as thought, with desertification starting around 7 million years ago. Climate simulations suggest the shrinking of the Tethys Sea coupled with the uplift of the Arabian peninsula weakened the summer monsoon, forming the vast desert that exists today much longer ago than thought. Research led by the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway suggests the age of the Sahara desert (shown) is double previous estimates. Evidence had suggested that some dunes in Chad, part of the Sahara desert, were as much as 7 million years old . The research, published in Nature, was co-authored by Dr Zhongshi Zhang, a palaeoclimatologist at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway. The evidence comes partially from dune deposits in northern Chad that were estimated to be seven million years old. Other studies also found evidence for extended dry spells in the region starting eight million years ago. The reason why this was so was not known, but now Dr Zhang says he may have an answer. His team’s climate simulations suggest a gradual rearrangement of land masses in northern Africa. The Sahara desert is one of the largest deserts in the world and covers more than 3.5 million square miles (9 million square km) - 10 per cent of the African continent. It is bordered by the Red Sea in the east and the Atlantic Ocean in the west . The desert covers parts of several African nations including Algeria, Chad, Egypt and Sudan. About a quarter of the desert is made of dunes, with some of them reaching more than 150 metres (500 ft) in height. One permanent river runs through the Sahara today - the Nile. One particular shift was thought to occur in the Tethys Sea that once bordered northern Africa. The sea gradually shrunk around seven to 11 million years ago, and it’s thought this may have weakened the African summer monsoon. The uplift of the Arabian peninsula was also thought to play a part. The quelling of the monsoon would in turn have weakened westerly winds, shifting a flow of moisture from the tropical Atlantic further south. This suggests the desertification, and ultimately the formation of the Sahara desert, may have formed earlier than thought. ‘Not only did the Tethys shrinkage alter the mean climate of the region, it also enhanced the sensitivity of the African monsoon to orbital forcing, which subsequently became the major driver of Sahara extent fluctuations,’ the researchers write. ‘These important climatic changes probably caused the shifts in Asian and African flora and fauna observed during the same period.' Climate simulations suggest the shrinking of a body of water called the Tethys Sea (shown) may have weakened the African summer monsoon. This led to the desertification of northern Africa earlier than thought. The Sahara desert is one of the world's largest deserts and covers about 10 per cent of the African continent .","Research led by the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway suggests the age of the Sahara desert is double previous estimates .

Artists from Art F City have posed naked as pandas for their calendar in a bid to raise funds to keep their blog running. Entitled 'Artists as Pandas in the Nude,' and photographed by Rachel Stern,  it is said to feature notable artists, dealers and writers. The saucy shoot was reportedly inspired by the switching off of the popular 'panda cam' at  Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, US. The live feed of the zoo's famous resident, Mei Xiang, went down just days after she delivered her cub Bao Bao, due to a US Government shut down last year. In a bid to beat the blackout the artists performed panda related activities 24-hours-a-day, which they then streamed live on their website. 'The whole thing was so absurd, so we decided to livestream ourselves blogging while dressed like pandas,' Paddy Johnson, AFC's founder and editor, told the LA Times.

"A broke former footballer who masqueraded as Chelsea loanee Gael Kakuta in order to fund a luxury lifestyle of champagne, women, fast cars and shopping sprees was jailed for four years on Wednesday. Medi Abalimba, 24, was once a promising star, earning up to £4,000-a-week and was once sold to Derby County for £1.2million and. But his career bombed after he struggled to recover from an injury. Unwilling to give up his celebrity life, he began breaking into lockers at the private health club in Camden, where he was a member, in order to steal credit card details. Medi Abalimba, 24 (left), has been jailed for four years after duping bars, restaurants, luxury stores and five-star hotels out of thousands of pounds by pretending to be Chelsea player Gael Kakuta . Abalimba was caught after trying to buy £20,000 worth of goods at Selfridges in the Trafford Centre (pictured) Blues winger Kakuta on his sixth loan spell at Chelsea after joining Rayo Vallecano . He would then go on spending sprees in luxury shops, five-star hotels and trendy nightclubs pretending to be winger Kakuta - who is on his sixth loan spell from Chelsea with Real Vallecano - while using the card details to pay. During one incident he duped starstruck staff into running up a £25,000 bar tab on Cristal champagne in one London club  claiming 'he was a Premier League star and good for the money.' He also ran up a £12,000 bill at three luxury London hotels, took a bar in Manchester for another £5,000, scrounged suites in luxury apartment complexes and spent £11,000 on limousines. On another occasion he took four star-struck girls from Manchester on a £1,100 helicopter tour over London before having them stay with him at an £800-a-night rented mansion in Berkshire, which he falsely claimed was his home. He also used another woman’s credit cards to rack up a £4,633 bill at a spa and to hire a Range Rover at a cost of £2,397. Abalimba took four girls on a £1,100 helicopter ride over London, before inviting them back to a £800-a-night mansion in Berkshire, saying it was his home . Abalimba was caught after he attempted to buy clothing worth more than £20,000 from Selfridge's at the Trafford Centre near Manchester - even practising his football skills inside while browsing. After being arrested, he claimed his one-time massive weekly wage left him with a 'wholly unrealistic' understanding of money. Abalimba was born in the Congo and had begun his career as a midfielder in the youth teams of Crystal Palace and Fulham, before moving to Southend United where he was paid £1,000-a-week at just 16 years old. He attracted attention from several Premier League clubs early in his career and was given trials at Manchester United and Manchester City. At Liverpool, he played for the reserves while the then manager Rafa Benitez watched from the stands and eventually signed for Derby County in 2009 for £1.2m. He was paid £4,000 a week and received an appearance fee of £1,000 as a substitute, and £2,000 for starting a match. But his career was curtailed by injury and he was sent to Oldham Athletic on a free transfer in January 2011 having failed to make a competitive appearance. In August 2012 he was signed by Farnborough Town with a wage of just £300-a-week and was forced to supplement his income with part-time work as a taxi firm controller. Fearing his friends would dump him, he turned to fraud in order to keep up the illusion of wealth. He called venues in advance, pretending to be Kakuta’s agent and advising them of his imminent arrival before using 'compromised' credit cards to pay for goods and services. He took friends for a night out in London where he duped staff at the Cirque du Soir burlesque club in Soho into giving him champagne after convincing them he had put his credit card behind the bar. When a waiter could not find the card, Abalimba said he was a Premier League footballer and showed the server photos of himself posing in football shirts with Premier League stars. He then racked up the five-figure bar tab entertaining a table of 10 guests, buying bottles of champagne which cost up to £5,000 each - even offering to buy bubbly for a man at the next table. In all he ordered two jeroboams of Cristal, each equivalent to four regular bottles, and used a microphone to invite the entire club back to his house for a party. At the end of the night, it was discovered he could not pay the bill and police arrived to arrest him. Abalimba once ran up a £25,000 bar tab in a London club, buying two jeroboams of Cristal champagne, telling bar staff he was 'good for the money (pictured, Abalimba is arrested) Kakuta (right) trains alongside former Chelsea team-mate Nicolas Anelka in 2009 . At the time he claimed he had been given a credit card by his French football club but was given a six-month suspended sentence. Just months later he phoned a trendy club in Manchester and put on an American accent, pretended to be the agent for Gael Kakuta and asked for a table. Throughout the the evening he posed as Kakuta to order champagne worth £2,600. At the end of the night claimed he had left his wallet in a limousine and told staff he had his credit card details over the phone. He also enjoyed drinks at several nightclubs and restaurants including the acclaimed Gilgamesh, run by head chef Ian Pengelley, where he ran up a bill of £8,000 for 20 of his friends. Kakuta had temporary spells at Fulham, Bolton, Dijon, Vitesse and Lazio . The payment, made using stolen credit card details, was authorised and Abalimba then pre-paid more than £2,000, telling staff he would return. The next night he drank champagne with friends before leaving in a chauffeur driven Bentley GT. Last July Abalimba went to Selfridges in the Trafford Centre where he chose more than £20,000 worth of clothing only to claim he could not pay with his credit card as it had been damaged. He later phoned the store to try and make a payment over the phone using the stolen credit card details. But just as a chauffeur was sent to collect the goods, a store detective became suspicious and withheld the items. Police traced Abalimba to a mansion where he had been staying and he later told police he regularly broke into lockers at a sports club in Camden using master keys,  and used his phone to photograph members’ credit card details. It emerged that in London he ran up huge bills during hotel stays, including £7,000 at the Corinthia hotel, £3,000 at Mandarin, £2,000 at Millennium Hotel and £1,400 at Bulgari Hotel. Officers found his fingerprints on a pair of Harvey Nichols shoes the fraudster had attempted to give out as a tip. In Manchester he deceived hotels including Park Inn, Worsley Marriott and the Great John St Hotel. He also attempted to book £4,206 worth of rooms at The Midland but was thwarted by extra security checks by staff there. He also tried to fraudulently obtain a £9,000 Rolex watch from a jeweller. At Manchester Crown Court, Abalimba, who is currently living in west London admitted three charges of fraud, taking a Range Rover without consent and making off without paying for £104 worth of petrol and asked for 19 other offences to be considered. After the case Sgt Adam Cronshaw of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Having spoken with many of the victims in this case it appears that Abalimba is a charming and charismatic individual who was able to call on his previous football experience and the fact he bears some resemblance to the real Gael Kakuta to deceive them. 'He was able to trick most people he came across and grew in confidence the longer the charade continued. He became so skilled in lies and deceit that his character went from being plausible to unquestionable. Kakuta made four loan appearances for Bolton Wanderers while on loan in 2011 . Kakuta (second left) made seven appearances for Fulham while on loan at Craven Cottage . 'Abalimba told us that many of his victims treated him so differently because they thought he was a celebrity footballer. Unfortunately this trust and goodwill was misplaced. 'While I have some sympathy for the way his career was curtailed, there can be no excuses for the persistent and deliberate frauds that have left numerous people and businesses out of pocket. 'I’m glad we were able to catch him and prevent further loss to other potential victims as he showed no signs of halting his activity. 'I hope more businesses are now aware of this scam and have the necessary security measures in place to prevent similar occurrences.' Police said the latest frauds totalled £163,000 but with no assets or cash to his name there is no opportunity for financial compensation to be paid to victims.","Medi Abalimba, 24, once earned £4,000-a-week as a promising footballer .

"A new test could be used to warn if smokers are likely to develop lung cancer. Scientists have discovered that cells taken from the mouth and nose react differently to infrared light in people vulnerable to the disease. The results of these tests could help target CT scans more effectively - and potentially lead to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes for lung cancer patients in the future. Compared with some other types of cancer, the outlook for lung cancer has not improved greatly over the decades. Scroll down for video . Scientists have discovered a test that could warn smokers if they are likely to develop lung cancer. They discovered cells taken from the mouth and nose react differently to infrared light in people vulnerable to developing the disease . Only 10 per cent of patients will live for five years or more from being diagnosed. This is mainly due to the disease being diagnosed at a late stage. Professor Sam Janes, from University College London, said: 'This non-invasive test can help identify those who are at greatest risk within adult smokers, and may help target CT screening far more effectively. 'Our vision for the future is that smokers could get a test in the GP or pharmacy, swab their mouth or nose, and the sample is then sent off for analysis. The earlier lung cancer is detected the better the outcome. ' Patients who develop lung tumours may have subtle abnormalities in all cells in their lungs, mouth and nose. This signature of abnormality can be seen – very subtly – by shining light on the cells. The cells reflect or refract the light differently when compared to those who do not have lung cancer. Professor Janes added: 'Tobacco smoke exposure seems to cause a different type of injury to cells in those that go on to develop lung cancer. 'If we can use this detection system early enough maybe we can spot lung cancer at a much earlier stage or even inform whether an individual is at risk of lung cancer. 'Our study, using infrared light to examine such cells for the first time, revealed that the cells of smokers with lung cancer could be differentiated from those without lung cancer with an accuracy of 80 per cent.' The scientists studied samples from 76 smokers, half of whom had been diagnosed with lung cancer. Lung cancer can remain dormant for 20 years before it is triggered into an aggressive form of the disease, a study has warned. The first genetic mutations which cause the cancer could go undetected for up to two decades before additional faults trigger cancer cells to grow rapidly. During this expansion there is a surge of different genetic faults appearing in separate areas of the tumour. Each distinct section evolves down different paths - meaning that every part of the tumour is genetically unique. Researchers hope the new discovery will lead to earlier detection. Two-thirds of patients are diagnosed with advanced forms of lung cancer, when treatments are less likely to be successful. Over 40,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year, but fewer than a tenth survive for at least five years after being diagnosed. Previous research had shown that the way very pure light generated by a synchrotron particle accelerator is scattered by human cells may indicate the presence of the disease. Further work showed that infrared light can produce the same results in a laboratory setting. Professor Janes, a member of the British Thoracic Society, added: 'Our vision for the future is that smokers could get a test in the GP or pharmacy, swab their mouth or nose, and the sample is then sent off for analysis. 'The earlier lung cancer is detected, the better the outcome.' The research was presented at the British Thoracic Society's Winter Meeting in London. Next the scientists plan to analyse samples from a larger population and monitor participants over time to see how many develop lung cancer. The results could help identify which patients should be referred for CT (computed tomography) X-ray scans. The work was funded by the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation. In lung cancer, cells in the lungs start to multiply in an uncontrolled way, forming a growing area called the primary cancer or primary tumour. This is a malignant cancer that can cause symptoms such as a persistent cough, coughing up blood, and shortness of breath. Another study, also by University College London, supported the need for screening and early diagnosis. The study highlighted that patients with no symptoms have better chances of a cure from lung cancer than those who are diagnosed later and with symptoms. A five year study revealed that 61 per cent of patients treated surgically for lung cancer were diagnosed 'incidentally' through investigations performed by other specialties in the hospital. The patients who came to hospital with cancer-related symptoms had a significantly higher chance of dying from cancer. Compared with some other types of cancer, the outlook for lung cancer has not improved greatly over the decades. Pictured, is a human lung cancer cell under a microscope . Professor Janes added: 'This research clarifies the need for early screening, as certain forms of lung cancer can only be surgically treated in the earliest stages. 'More needs to be done to reach those in the community with have high risk factors, and encourage early screening to detect lung cancer as quickly as possible.' The sooner we can treat, the better the chance of survival for these patients.' Dr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: 'Being able to screen people with a higher risk of developing lung cancer, such as people who smoke, before they present with symptoms, could potentially help us save the lives of thousands of people. 'Late presentation and diagnosis are key reasons for the very poor survival rates from this disease, which are worse in the UK than in Europe and the US. 'Diagnosing lung cancer at an earlier stage could greatly improve the chances of successful treatment and, therefore, survival. 'Studies such as this further emphasise the need for more investment in lung cancer research, funding for which is significantly lower than for most other forms of the disease. The greater the investment, the greater our chances of achieving more potentially landmark breakthroughs such as this'.","Test involves looking at cells from the mouth and nose under infrared light .

"A top Russian diplomat has accused the U.S. of trying to use sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine to engineer a regime change in Moscow. 'It is hardly a secret that the goal of the sanctions is to create social and economic conditions to carry out a change of power in Russia,' said deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov. 'There will be no easy or fast way out of this.' Under pressure: Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting with Francois Hollande, France's president, on Saturday. Moscow believes U.S. sanctions are an attempt to engineer regime change . Russian President Vladimir Putin has struck a belligerent tone in his relations with the West, particularly over the crisis in Ukraine and the gradual spread eastwards of Nato. His inner circle has been personally targeted by economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the EU, touted as an attempt to erode support for his policies at the highest level in Russia. Speaking in the lower house of Russia's parliament, Mr Ryabkov told deputies relations between Moscow and Washington were in a deep chill and were likely to remain so if sanctions continued. Ties between Russia and the U.S. took a dive this year as the Cold War-era foes traded accusations following a coup which brought to power a new pro-West government in Ukraine. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian province of Crimea, site of a major Russian naval base, while partisans seized towns in the east and refused to recognise Kiev's new regime. Holy place: Mr Putin and Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, right, visit the renovated Church of St. Sergius of Radonezh at the Tsarskoye Selo State Museum-Preserve in St Petersburg . Tragedy: A grave of an unknown soldier killed fighting for the airport outside the rebel-held city of Donetsk, east Ukraine.

Nato and Kiev say that Russia has been providing material support, including weapons and manpower, to the insurgency . Kiev and Nato have accused Russia of providing material support to the insurgency, while Moscow has accused the West of helping to engineer Ukraine's coup and supporting fascist groups which now hold positions in government. Last week the U.S. House of Representatives approved a resolution that would authorise President Barack Obama to openly send weapons to the Kiev government. Although that still needs approval from the Senate, it would mark a serious escalation of the conflict. President Putin has portrayed Western sanctions as an attempt to contain Russia and punish it for becoming strong and independent, an opinion echoed by influential Russian media. In his state-of-the-nation address last week, the Russian president accused the the West of ‘trying to build a new Iron Curtain’. He claimed Russia was asserting its ‘sovereignty and national pride’ over its dealings with neighbouring Ukraine – and said his country’s survival depended on it. Also well armed: Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko shakes hands with a soldier from a mechanised infantry brigade as he presented the unit with 100 units of heavy arms, including tanks and helicopters . Soon to be even better armed: Last week the U.S. House of Representatives approved a resolution that would authorise President Barack Obama to openly send weapons to the Kiev government . Claiming the West wanted to see a Yugoslav-style ‘collapse and dismemberment’ of Russia, he said: ‘This has not happened. We did not allow it. ‘Hitler also failed when, with his hateful ideas, he was going to destroy Russia, throw us back behind the Urals. Everyone should remember how it ended.’ An opinion poll released by the independent Levada research group on Monday showed 74 per cent of Russians have negative views of the U.S. Levada said the figures marked the lowest point in Russians' attitudes towards the United States since 1990, the year before the Soviet Union collapsed .","Deputy foreign minister makes comments in speech to Russian parliament .

"A cloud of shifting shape and speed that had many meteorologists baffled has turned out to be a swarm of butterflies migrating for the winter.

One of those odd shapes, oddly enough, was the shape of a giant butterfly. Scroll down for videos . What are the odds: The cloud, which kept changing size and speed and baffled most meteorologists, was even shaped like a butterfly on the radar (above) Winter break: What appeared to be a large cloud over St. Louis, Missouri was actually a swarm of Monarch butterflies (above) heading South for the winter . The National Weather Service was eventually able to conclude that this was an immense swarm of Monarch butterflies making their annual trip down to the mountains of Mexico for the winter months. They shared this news, and how it is these delicate winged creatures were detected as a cloud, on their Facebook page last week. The sheer size of this swarm is also good news as America's Monarch population has been in decline over the past few years due to habitat loss and extreme weather. Bigger and better: The size of the swarm of butterflies is good news for the species, whose numbers had begun to drop recently in America due to habitat loss and extreme weather . The orange and black beauties will now fly thousands of miles south and, hopefully, make the trip back north come Spring.

"Goodyear has created a range of tyres (stock image) that monitor the pressure of tyres and automatically inflates them using just a regulator and a tube . Inflating your tyres too much can cause them to tear, while not having enough pressure can lead to punctures and damage to the suspension. With this in mind, Goodyear has created tyres that monitor pressure, and automatically inflate using just a regulator and a tube. If the regulator senses the pressure dropping it opens a valve to let air in, and this pumps up the tyre to the correct pounds per square inch (PSI). All the components of the AMT system, including the pump, are contained within the tyre. Correctly inflated tyres can save fuel as well as lead to carbon dioxide reductions, while increasing the life of the tyre. Ohio-based Goodyear began developing the Air Maintenance Technology (AMT) in 2011 and will now start testing the tyres on trucking fleets in the US and Canada over the next 18 months. ‘This is an important milestone in the development of AMT for the commercial trucking marketplace,’ said Joseph Zekoski, Goodyear’s chief technical officer. ‘The tyres equipped with AMT have performed well in testing, and we are pleased that so many of our fleet customers were eager to collaborate with us in the next phase of testing.’ The system uses a so-called peristaltic pump technology to automatically maintain tyre pressure. This pressure is programmed in before the tyres are fitted, and is based on the individual car or truck’s PSI. The system (illustrated) uses a so-called peristaltic pump technology to automatically maintain tyre pressure. An internal regulator senses when the pressure drops below the specified PSI, which then opens to allow air into the pumping tube. As the tyre rolls, it flattens the tube pushing air through the valve and into the tyre .

As the tyre rolls, it flattens the tube pushing air through the valve and into the tyre cavity to inflate it to the optimised pressure. The Department of Energy’s Office of Vehicle Technology has given $1.5 million to help research, develop and test the AMT system for commercial vehicle tyres. According to Goodyear, tyre-related costs are the single largest maintenance item for commercial vehicle fleets. Only 44 percent of all truck tyres are within five PSI of their target pressure, and 7 per cent are underinflated by 20 PSI or more. ‘The phase of [AMT] testing will go a long way in helping us determine when we can make this technology available in the commercial tyre marketplace,’ continued Mr Zekoski. Earlier this month, the company also a long haul drive tyre in North America, called the Goodyear Fuelmax LHD G505D, designed to save fuel.","Goodyear began developing the Air Maintenance Technology in 2011 .
It will now start testing the tyres on trucking fleets in the US and Canada .
A regulator senses when inflation pressure drops below the specified PSI .
Regulator then opens to allow air flow into the pumping tube .
As the tyre rolls, it flattens the tube and pushes air into the valve .
This air flows into the tyre cavity and inflates it to the optimised pressure ."

"A grandmother-of-six has a eyebrow raising hobby - knitting penis-shaped blankets. Holly Stewart, 59, wants to bring humour and art together to shun the typical stereotypes about old ladies. Her craftmanship is on display at a US art gallery and some of the 'exhibits' are more than five-foot long. Scroll down for video . Missouri grandmother Holly Stewart, pictured, enjoys working with cloth and 'frequently thinks about penises' Ms Stewart said her work was designed to challenge male dominance and question the power of men . She also wanted to show that grandmothers can knit more exciting things than socks and blankets . The grandmother-of-six, from Missouri, said: 'My favourite medium to work with is cloth and I frequently think about penises. 'I wanted to use these together and create something alluring and iconic. 'Quilting is a craft that women of a certain age are expected to employ - I did just that except instead of blankets I knit penises and scrotums.' Using techniques she learned at the Kansas City Art Institute, Ms Stewart created beaded, sequinned and pinned penises. An exhibition called HollyPolyester: Local Grandmother Quilts Giant Penises is taking place at the UMKC Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Missouri throughout September. Ms Stewart said that people don't always identify immediately the subject of her various artworks . The penises are in various sizes from a few inches up to several feet in length and come in various colours . Ms Stewart has made her artworks in a range of fabrics giving each a different tactile experience . Ms Stewart ran the exhibition to showcase the work she had done for her MA thesis in fibre and surface design. She hopes her work will help people talk about gender, sexuality, sex and aging as well as change attitudes to the elderly and sex. Ms Stewart said: 'I want people to see my work and ask questions about male dominance and the power of men. 'People first see them and they think they are granny's knick knacks but disguising the penises as soft toys makes people laugh and certainly makes them talk.' Some of Ms Stewart's extensive range of extravagant  penises are more prickly than others . The artworks would make the ideal soft furnishing gift for most modern families with a sense of humour .","Holly Stewart from Missouri likes knitting giant man-sized penises .

"Christmas television has become as important to the modern festive season as roast turkey and gift giving. But audiences this year will be left with a distinct feeling of déjà vu, with nearly two-thirds of programmes on the country’s major channels being repeats, believed to be the highest total ever. Across BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4, 63 percent of programmes during the two week period from December 20 and January 2 will have been seen before, including vintage hits such as Dad’s Army, The Vicar of Dibley and Morecambe & Wise. This is up from a reported 47.5 percent for the same period last year. The broadcasters will show a combined total of 670 hours, or nearly four weeks’ worth, of repeats in the fortnight between December 20 and January 2, even recycling episodes of game shows such as Pointless . But it was the BBC which found itself facing particular criticism yesterday after it emerged 62 percent of the festive output on BBC1 and BBC2 will be repeats. Campaigners claimed people do not pay the licence fee to watch programmes ‘for the umpteenth time’ and said the corporation must deliver better value for money. The 315 repeats broadcast by BBC1 and BBC2 in the two-week period total 331 hours of reused content and include Only Fools and Horses, Eastenders, Blackadder and even repeats of game shows such as Pointless. The worst offender was again BBC2 - with 74 percent of programmes being repeats, a figure equivalent to last year - prompting accusations the corporation is failing licence fee payers by not providing enough new shows. On Saturday, December 20, Christmas University Challenge and Rik Mayall Lord of Misrule are the only original shows in the channel’s 21 hour schedule. Last night, a spokesman for The TaxPayer’s Alliance said: ‘“Viewers will be left wondering why the cost of a TV Licence is not coming down when they are being subjected to more and more repeats. Amusing as it is, Licence fee payers will question why it costs £145 a year to watch Dad’s Army for the umpteenth time - if they wanted to watch it on endless repeat, they could buy the DVDs. The BBC has to focus on delivering better value for money or sympathy for the TV tax will continue to wane.’ The Royle Family is one of the 315 repeats broadcast by BBC1 and BBC2 in the two-week period total 331 hours of reused content . ITV are broadcasting vintage sitcom Birds of a Feather . Excluding news bulletins, between Saturday December 20 and Friday January 2, 62 per cent of the corporation’s output will be repeats, up from just under sixty percent last year, with 315 of the 511 scheduled shows having been seen before by audiences. Among the tried and tested family favourites will be The Two Ronnies, Mrs Brown’s Boys, and old episodes of Antiques Road Trip and Flog It! These figures compare to 57 percent for ITV and 72 percent for Channel 4, where viewers will be able to almost daily re-watch comedies such as The Simpsons and Fraiser. Broadcasters are also delving into the back catalogue for films keep families entertained, with the likes of Sister Act, Calendar Girls and The Eagle Has Landed filling the BBC schedules, with only 18 of the 112 films set to air on BBC1 and BBC2 having not appeared on the channels before. Despite mounting concerns they are failing to provide enough new programming over the festive period, the broadcasters said they had ensured peak-time viewing hours were dominated by new shows. A BBC spokesman added: ‘The BBC invests more in television at Christmas than any other UK broadcaster. Well over 90% of programmes in peak time on BBC1 will be brand new, including Roald Dah’s Esio Trot, Harry Hill’s Professor Branestawm and the final two episodes of Miranda, plus specials from Doctor Who, Call the Midwife, Mrs Brown’s Boys and Still Open All Hours. There are some carefully chosen repeats in the mix including family favourites and much loved treats from previous years including Royle Family and Vicar of Dibley.’","63 per cent of programmes on major channels will be repeats .

"The misogynistic character was officially killed off by his creator last month after a storm of accusations over sexism. However, Daniel O'Reilly's Dapper Laughs could soon be coaxed out of retirement after making the nominees for Best Breakthrough Act at next February's Brit Awards. The comedian from Clapham, south London, is on the longlist along with more than 90 other acts after his single Proper Moist made it into the Top 20 in the singles chart earlier this year . Scroll down for video . Dapper Laughs is on long list of candidates for Best Breakthrough Act for his song Proper Moist . The Dapper Laughs character was axed after thousands of Britons petitioned to have his show banned from ITVBe. The  nomination has been awarded on a technicality - bands and solo artists are eligible for a place on the list if they have had a single or album in the Top 40 in the past year. The only official rule preventing an artist getting onto the list is a  nomination for a Brit Award or track in the charts in a previous year. Neither the death of a character, nor causing the offence of a nation, are enough to get Dapper Laughs blacklisted from the category. A Brit Awards spokesman told the Independent: 'Bands are eligible for British Breakthrough Act category if they have had an Official Charts Company Top 40 single and/or artist album chart success in the current eligibility period. Tracey Emin has designed the winners' trophy for the Brit Awards 2015 . 'They are not eligible if they have previously been nominated in any Brit Award category (excluding Critics’ Choice) or had an Official Charts Company Top 30 single and/or artist album prior to the period.' A panel of music industry experts will be whittling the current longlist down to five for the shortlist. The public are then able to choose from the final list in an online vote in the weeks running up to the music event. Given that Proper Moist includes lyrics such as, 'If she's looking at me but playing with her hair, By the end of the night she'll need a wheelchair,' it is unlikely that the family-friendly Brits panel will be nominating Dapper for his musical efforts at the 2015 awards. And even if he was given one of the coveted shortlist slots, it is unknown whether Daniel O'Reilly would turn up at London's O2 for the ceremony. Daniel O'Reilly announced he was killing off Dapper Laughs on Newsnight in November . In November, the Londoner declared 'Dapper Laughs is gone,' on BBC's Newsnight after a wave of negative headlines about his comedy routine. In the same week, the huge backlash against his sexist jokes, which include telling men 'Just show her your penis' and 'If she cries, she’s just playing hard to get,' also saw ITV announce that it would no longer commission his programme On The Pull. He said at the time: 'I didn't think that so many people would end up seeing it. 'In the end it became very popular and I kind of got a bit carried away with it, to be honest with you. 'It's wrong but, to me, I didn't see it as me who was saying it, I was creating this character and I was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was popular. 'I thought that the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it.' At 2014's Brit Awards, the award was given to the band Bastille.","Dapper Laughs is on long list of candidates for Best Breakthrough Act .

"A German newspaper has risked a royal upset by publishing a  photograph of the Duchess of  Cambridge’s bare bottom.

The . latest photograph was taken as the Duchess boarded a helicopter to . Sydney after an official tour of the Blue Mountains with Prince William . last month.

"Donald Sterling’s ex-assistant V. Stiviano claims the former L.A. Clippers owner is gay and that she spent three years acting as his beard so no one would suspect his true sexuality. Stiviano, who gained national notoriety earlier this year due to her alleged sexual relationship with Sterling, made the bombshell allegation in documents filed at the Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday in answer to a prior lawsuit filed by Sterling’s wife, Shelly Sterling. In her original lawsuit, Shelly had accused Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling Family including a Ferrari, $240,000 in cash and a $1.8 million house on the outskirts of Beverly Hills in exchange for sexual favors. Scroll down for audio . Donald Sterling’s ex-assistant V. Stiviano claims the former L.A. Clippers owner is gay and that she spent three years acting as his beard so no one would suspect his true sexuality . Stiviano denies those allegations and even claims that Shelly Sterling was well aware of  the exact nature of the relationship between Donald Sterling and Stiviano. ‘V.S. was D.T.S’s beard for three years prior to the filing of suit,’ the answer claimed. ‘V.S. is informed and believes that (Sterling) is a homosexual and enjoys sexual acts and or sexual congress with males.’ The answer said that Shelly Sterling was ‘acutely aware of his orientation and condoned’ his behavior, including his decision to give ‘gifts, money and other properties’ to Stiviano for her public companionship, reports the Daily News. Stiviano also says that she ‘was not ever a sexual partner’ of Donald Sterling. In her original lawsuit, Shelly Sterling accused Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling Family including a Ferrari, $240,000 in cash and a $1.8 million house on the outskirts of Beverly Hills in exchange for providing Donald with sexual favors . She also states that the gifts are considered separate property, not 'marital or community property,' because they were purchased with funds earned by Donald after separation or 'estrangement' from her wife. Stiviano also filed a $10 million defamation lawsuit against the Sterlings on Thursday. She claims they slandered her in the media by calling her a thief and saying she embezzled money and property from Donald. 'She’s delusional,’ Sterling’s lawyer, Max Blecher, told The Daily News. The drama began in April when a recording surfaced of Donald Sterling berating Stiviano for bringing black men to Clippers games. The audio spurred the NBA to ban Sterling for life and fine him $2.5 million. Stiviano also filed a $10 million defamation lawsuit against the Sterlings on Thursday, claiming they slandered her in the media by calling her a thief and saying she embezzled money and property from Donald . Shelly, his wife of 58 years, then took control of a family trust and negotiated a record $2 billion sale of the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Shelly Sterling said she was initially given her husband's blessing to sell the team and he praised the deal she reached. When it came time to sign it at the end of May, however, Sterling said he would not sell and would sue the league. Ballmer officially became the new owner of the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday.","Donald Sterling's ex-assistant V. Stiviano claims the former L.A.

'It is important to have a goalkeeper like him or Michel Vorm or Brad Friedel,' the Spurs head coach said. 'They have a lot of experience and they are top class. 'Yes, he produced two or three big saves and I liked their goalkeeper because he produced two big saves too. It was 1-0 and if we scored the second goal, then we kill the game. 'When the game is open and they have the opportunity, they have the chance and we let them open the game, but it is okay. It is football and we need to accept that.' Besiktas counterpart Slaven Bilic was more forthcoming with praise for Lloris after the match, calling the goalkeeper 'one of the best' in the world after this display.

Hugo Lloris denies Demba Ba from point-blank range, one of his many crucial saves for Tottenham . However, he saved his biggest compliments for his team after they fought back to secure a deserved draw at White Hart Lane. 'Well, it was, even for the neutrals, a good game of football,' the former Everton and West Ham defender said. 'Like every coach when your team is participating in a good game, we are happy. If the result comes with that, you are more happy, of course, but at least you are happy because you made the spectators happy. 'I don't want to sound big-headed but for every team that comes to White Hart Lane and takes a point, it is a good point. No matter what the team is, Manchester United, Besiktas, whatever - nobody is favourite here apart from Tottenham. 'The only thing I am not happy with is the result because we dominated from the first minute. 'We were basically excellent apart from the chances that we created but didn't score and it was so frustrating to go in at half-time 1-0 down. 'We were so good that I told them 'don't lose your head, just keep passing, keep passing, keep passing. It will come' - and then it came.'
