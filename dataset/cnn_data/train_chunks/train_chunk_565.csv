A ram raider's attempt at a quick getaway was thwarted by police when he tried to flee the scene of the crime in a lorry cab with a top speed of less than 60mph. The hapless thief had reversed the truck into the front of a luxury jewellers store in Southampton, Hampshire, jumped out of the cab and stolen a haul of expensive Rolex watches. But his plan began to unravel when the lorry got stuck in the shopfront stopping him from driving away. Scroll down for video . Drama: Onlookers gather around the scene after a ram raider smashed a truck into the front of a jewellers shop in Southampton, Hampshire, and tried to steal Rolex watches . Thwarted: The bungling ram raider's truck got caught in the front of the jewellers shop and he couldn't drive the vehicle away . Damage: A police officer inspects the front of the jewellers shop which was reversed into by the lorry . The would-be raider managed to unhitch the cab from the trailer and waved at witnesses who were filming the incident on their mobile phones. Police gave chase moments after the incident and tried to pull the cab over moments after he drove away from the store, leaving the trailer blocking the road. But with a top speed of just 56mph, the crook made it less than two miles from the crime scene before he was stopped and arrested by officers who recovered the watches. Leeanne Bowers, 25, a supervisor at a model shop opposite the jewellers, described the raid as 'comical'. Hapless: The ram raider unhooked the cab of the truck and drove away from the scene leaving the trailer blocking the road . She said: 'I was talking to a customer at the front of my shop when I saw a lorry outside which seemed to be attempting a three-point turn. 'It started reversing towards the jewellers but didn't stop and smashed into the glass at the front. I couldn't believe it. 'The driver got out of the cab, walked over to the display and started to fill his pockets with jewellery. He looked so smug. 'He then walked casually back to the cab, threw his haul inside, and tried to drive away but realised he was stuck. It was so comical. 'By this time a lot of people had started to film the incident on their mobile phones, but he didn't seem to care - he even looked over and waved. 'He got back out, unhooked the cab and eventually raced away, dodging buses and other traffic.' She added: 'When he first smashed into the window and got out, I thought he was going over to apologise. I couldn't believe it was a raid. 'He made no attempt to cover himself up and looked so normal.' Charmaine Smith, 23, who was also working in a nearby shop, said: 'He was reversing and went through the window. 'He moved forward and out of the cab and walked around. He took his clips off the back of the lorry and unclipped it from the cab. 'He got back in and sped up the road and through the traffic lights.' Slow getaway: The raider made it less than two miles from the shop before he was caught by police as his getaway vehicle had a top speed of just 56mph . Arrest: Police recovered the watches that were stolen and arrested a 54-year-old man from Portsmouth . Susan Rolling, from Hampshire Constabulary, said: 'An articulated lorry had been reversed down the road and into the jewellers window, where the driver helped himself to watches. 'The thief fled from the scene in the white Mercedes cab of the lorry, leaving the trailer behind in the jewellers window and blocking the busy road. 'A few minutes later, police spotted the Mercedes cab. 'When officers attempted to pull it over, the driver reversed the cab into the police car. 'No one was injured, and police arrested a 54-year-old Portsmouth man.'","Raider reversed lorry into jewellers in Southampton, Hampshire .

A gang of yobs who fired a 'BB gun' in the street came face-to-face with the real thing when armed police swooped on them armed with submachine guns. The two boys and three girls sparked terror in Plymouth city centre when they were spotted brandishing the gun - which reportedly looked like a pistol - and began shooting at a building. But they soon had problems of their own after 999 operators sent in police marksmen armed with Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine-guns - capable of firing up to 800 rounds-per-minute - to arrest them. Scroll down for video . Operation: This was the moment machine-gun wielding cops swooped on an 'armed' teen gang - only to find their weapon was actually a BB gun . Careful: An armed officer keeps guard with his weapon as police search the gang on the floor . Fears: The group of two boys and three girls sparked fears after brandishing the weapon - reported to resemble a pistol - and began shooting . Officers pinned the youngsters down and handcuffed them before establishing the weapon only shoots ball bearings. The scenes were captured by professional cameraman Patrick Bishop, 45, who was walking past when the swoop unfolded. He said: 'A police car came to a screaming stop, two officers got out armed with guns and I just reached for my mobile phone. Contained: Officers pinned the youngsters down and cuffed them before establishing that the fake weapon posed no threat .

One was dealt with by restorative justice while no action was taken against the other.

Google is set to to launch an online streaming music service later this year to take on Spotify, it has been claimed. The move is also seen as a pre-emptive strike on Apple, which is also believed to be working on a music streaming service. Negotiations for the Google service have been underway for several months and it will launch later this year, according to reports. The new Google service would compete with Spotify (pictured) which offers a free service with ads alongside a £9.99 per month ad free service . 'Negotiations are under way with major record labels to license their music' Bloomberg claimed. 'Google, which also owns the YouTube video website, is also discussing renewing deals that cover the use of songs in videos made by consumers,' Bloomberg's sources claimed. The service could expand on Google's existing cloud-based music service, which launched in 2011 to compete directly with Apple's . iTunes, which commands more than 60 per cent of all digital sales. Last year, . the service expanded to the UK, Germany and other European markets, and . today a new iPad version of the app needed to access files was launched in the UK. The app allows customers to play or . download music stored in Cloud Player to their iPad, play music that is . already stored on their device, and manage or create playlists. 'We introduced our Cloud Player app . for iPhone and iPod touch last summer and it’s been incredibly popular . with our customers so we’ve now expanded it to iPad,' said Steve Boom, . Vice President of Digital Music for Amazon. 'Our goal is to make Cloud Player the . most widely compatible cloud playback solution available, giving our . customers the ability to buy their music once and enjoy it everywhere.' Google data center in Douglas Country, Georgia: The search giant already has a vast network of servers which could be used for a music streaming service . However, a streaming version would make the service much more appealing to the milliom users who activate Android handsets every day. Francis Keeling, global head of digital business at Universal Music Group, said Google's scale could make a streaming product a huge success. Speaking in London at the launch of . industry body IFPI's annual report on Tuesday, Keeling told the Guardian: 'We talk . about subscription services, the need to have a funnel. 'Google, with . its hundreds of millions of users through search, YouTube with its more . than 800 million users, arguably is the biggest funnel we could have. 'Clearly if we could get consumers . into a legal funnel through that route and encourage them to . subscription, that would have a very positive impact on the business.' Google's biggest rival would be Spotify, the Swedish service which lists five million paying subscribers and 20 million users of its ad-supported service in 17 countries. Deezer, Rdio and Spotify all offer a free, ad-supported service alongside a £9.99-a-month subscription for premium users. The area is seen as the future of the music industry, and is expected to have contributed more than ten per cent of the music industry's digital revenue for the first time in 2012, while the number of paying subscribers surged by 44 per cent last year to 20 million people globally.","Search giant believed to be in advanced negotiations with major record labels for streaming music service .

Then Jamie Oliver’s restaurants could soon be the place for you. The celebrity chef joked about putting foxes on the menu yesterday, after one killed his rare pet swan. Writing on his Twitter page, the TV chef posted a picture of two cracked eggs laid by the female swan hours before it was attacked by a fox with the message: ‘So sad a massive fox killed my beautiful  black swan.’ Unusual pets: Chef Jamie Oliver and his wife Jools kept two rare-breed black swans at their Essex home - this year was the first time they'd mated . The message, which could be read by the star’s three million followers, continued: ‘Such a shame it was sitting on two eggs for the last month .  .  . Really sad, the fox didn’t even eat a thing, just tore up the mother – even worse I got it on CCTV. ‘Anyway nature has its cruel way but if you see fox on my menu soon don’t be surprised! Shame. Anyway, happy weekend guys, love to all.’ Oliver, 37, who has four children with his wife, former model Jools, has kept a pair of rare-breed black swans at his Essex farmhouse for several years. They are native to Australia and boast distinctive red beaks and black feathers. A spokesman for the star, known for his Jamie’s Italian restaurants, said this was the first year the swans – which breed for life – had mated, producing two eggs last month which the female had been guarding. The spokesman added Oliver was incubating the eggs at home in a bid to save the unborn cygnets.

Costly: Ammanford Police Station in South Wales, which will cost taxpayers £700,000-a-year for 30 years - even though it is closed to the public . A state-of-the-art police station is to cost taxpayers a total of £21million over the next 30 years, even though it is closed to the public. The front desk at the station, which opened 11 years ago in a 30-year private finance deal, is shut to save costs, and has been replaced by a mobile police van in the car park for eight-hours-a-week. But police are still committed to handing over £700,000-a-year for the station at Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, South Wales, in the finance deal until 2031. The total cost for the building, which provides a home for the force's Hi-tech Crime Unit and the Neighbourhood Policing Team for the Amman Towry area, will be £21m - almost 10 times the cost of building the station. Acting Chief Constable Jackie Roberts admitted the Ammanford station is 'too costly' and 'does not provide the public with value for money'. And Christopher Salmon, Police and Crime Commissioner in Dyfed Powys, said: 'What we've ended up with somehow is a state-of-the-art police station in the wrong place for the wrong price . 'I've inherited it and I know it's very expensive and it takes up a lot of my estates budget. 'It's deeply disappointing and particularly frustrating when obviously the police service is facing tough financial times as many public services are. 'We have this contract that we appear to be tied into that does cost us a lot of money.' The police station was built in a private finance initiative deal between the former Dyfed-Powys Police Authority and local building firm T Richard Jones, whose own offices are next door to the police station. Under the terms of the agreement, approved by the Home Office, TRJ used a bank loan to build the station for around £2.7m. The force then agreed to pay an annual fee to use the building and to pay for its maintenance after it opened in 2001. According to Home Office figures Dyfed-Powys Police agreed to hand over £700,000-a-year for the building for 30 years. Closed: The front desk at the station has been shut to save costs and replaced by a mobile police van in the car park for eight hours a week . The police station is costing 18 per cent of the force's entire estates budget. Acting Chief Constable Miss Roberts said: 'In recent years my predecessor met with the contractors in an effort to renegotiate the terms of the contract. 'However, this proved unsuccessful and currently there is no basis upon which we can seek to vary the terms of the contract in the absence of the agreement of the contractors.' A spokesman for builders TRJ said: 'The police set the terms of the contract. There is bank funding and it is not easy to renegotiate the deal.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'The funding for this PFI was agreed under a previous administration following an application by Dyfed-Powys Police Authority.' Deal: The police station was built in a private finance initiative deal between the former Dyfed-Powys Police Authority and local building firm T Richard Jones (pictured), which is based next to the station . Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'Badly negotiated PFI deals from the early 2000s have already cost taxpayers billions and this is yet another example of a contract for which we will bear the cost for decades to come. 'There is nothing wrong with the principle of PFI, which brings in private sector expertise and transfers some of the risks; but too many PFI deals have left a scandalous legacy and been used to shift debts off the public sector balance sheet and conceal growing debts that taxpayers will be paying for decades to come. 'It is crucial that politicians secure a better deal for taxpayers in future.'","Police station opened 11 years ago in a private finance deal .

Julia and Alex Gibbons, from Sheffield, have warned other tourists never to take similar flights as they say it was a 'miracle' they survived in 2011. They and around 20 others were left completely terrified after the overcrowded hot air balloon ran out of gas, narrowly missed a high-rise hotel before plunging into the Nile. Footage of the incident clearly . shows it is the same vessel as the one that took the lives of three . Britons and 16 other foreign tourists yesterday. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: A Sheffield couple were in the same balloon that exploded killing 19 yesterday when it crashed into the Nile in 2011 . Lucky: Julia and Alex Gibbons say nobody should ever take these flights as they believe it is a miracle they never died when it ran out of gas . 'We were lucky not to have been killed. It was a miracle that we weren't killed. It really was that close,' Mrs Gibbins said. Her husband Alex added: 'You get caught up in the holiday picture-postcard type of sell they . have for you but we weren't aware of the volume of people that went in a . basket.' The same balloon they rode in in 2011 exploded in a fireball 1,000ft above the Valley Of The Kings In Egypt yesterday. Joe Bampton, 40, and Yvonne Rennie were among 19 tourists killed during an early morning flight over the ancient ruins of Luxor when their balloon caught fire and exploded after it hit a power line. British resident Suzanna Gyetvai, 34, the girlfriend of Mr Bampton, also died in the blaze which killed 19 tourists. Holiday companies, including Thomas Cook, recommend that tourists take the tours, which cost around £70 per person. Footage: A video of the incident showed the full basket with frightened tourists fearing for their lives . View: The film shows the basket being dragged along the Nile before just making it over a boat and collapsing on the banks . Sixteen people were hurt, including two British women, when another balloon crashed during a tour of Luxor in April 2009. Retired policeman Linda Lea, 67, from Stoke-on-Trent, had to spend four months in hospital with 26 broken bones, and could not hide her distress that another incident had happened so soon afterwards. Following the 2009 crash, early morning hot air balloon flights over the Valley of the Kings on the West Bank of the Nile were suspended for six months while safety measures were tightened up. During the break, all 42 pilots from the eight companies who operate flights had extra training, but it has not stopped another disaster. 'It brought back all the mayhem and horrific events of that day,' Mrs Lea said. 'These balloons are just too unstable. There is not enough training of staff. There were about 22 or 23 in my . balloon when it crashed and maybe there was too many then, and too many . in today's accident,' she said. Beautiful: Hot air balloon trips over the Valley of the Kings is incredibly popular but there are plenty of horror stories from British tourists about them . Only last month Londoner Mark Packer was on a balloon ride in Luxor that left him 'scared' after the pilot seemed slapdash with equipment befoe they crashed into a tree. 'They go up to 800 or 1,000 feet, then bring the balloon down and across the temples at a low height,' he told the BBC. Michael Marlow, from Blairgowrie, said yesterday's tragedy brought back memories of a hot air balloon flight he took over the Valley of the Kings a few years ago. Mr Marlow said the balloon he was in caught fire as its operator tried to avoid power lines. He told BBC Radio Scotland that when he heard about the accident in Luxor, 'I thought ""There but for the grace of God, that could have happened to us"".' Heartbreak: The green and yellow balloon (far left), which had crashed into the Nile two years ago, pictured yesterday just 40 minutes before it exploded . Tragic: Medical workers in Cairo transfer bodies of victims of the hot air balloon crash off a plane from Luxor . Loss of life: Three Britons died when the balloon dropped from the sky at 1,000 ft over Egypt during a dawn flight . Speaking on the Good Morning Scotland programme, he said: 'We went to Luxor and we had an early-morning flight. The balloon flight should have taken us over the Valley of the Kings but, due to the wind direction, it took us in another direction. 'We started to head towards some power lines and whether the operator didn't see them or not we don't know, but what happened was he started frantically to get the balloon above the power lines, and in doing so he set the balloon on fire.' He added: 'I was looking down at the time, but suddenly my neck felt rather warm, and I said to the gentleman next to me and he looked up and said 'No wonder - the balloon is on fire'. 'Suddenly all this hot debris came falling down on us and we dropped down into the basket and he put his coat over us and we just sat down right in the bottom of the basket. 'In a matter of minutes really, I can't say how long it took, the balloon started to come down very fast and all I can remember is we had this heavy thud on the ground and we landed in this field. 'When we stopped no-one spoke. Everyone was shook up and in shock.' Mr Marlow said he was not injured but his wife was 'very badly bruised' and another man in the balloon hurt his ankle, leaving him struggling to walk, .

Sports Direct has raced to the rescue of collapsed fashion chain Republic snapping up 116 stores, saving 2,100 jobs. It is the latest distressed acquisition by the downturn-busting retailer controlled by founder Mike Ashley. Earlier this week he released an eye-watering £100million fortune by selling down some of his stake in the business he floated in 2007. Snapped up: Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has moved in on Republic, which collapsed earlier this month . Collapse: The Republic brand has gone bust but Mr Ashley has now saved 116 retail stores and 2,100 jobs along with its head office in Leeds, its websites and brands . Insiders say the share sale was unconnected to the Republic deal which was a transaction conducted by Sports Direct. Sports Direct (up 3p to 417.5p) has already invested in Sir Tom Hunter’s Cruise fashion chain and bought 20 JJB Sports stores and stock as it seeks to diversify into fashion. The firm said it had struck a deal with administrator Ernst & Young to acquire the bulk of the Republic stores, the head office in Leeds, stock, as well as Republic’s website and own brands. These include SoulCal, Fabric and Crafted. It declined to give any details about future plans for the business. New deal: Mike Ashley, whose biggest brand is Sports Direct, has a track record of investing in or buying stores and stock from ailing businesses . Republic, which employed 2,500 staff in 123 stores, collapsed earlier this month and administrators closed five shops in Scotland making 97 employees redundant and cast off 49 workers in Ireland from two stores. Reclusive billionaire Mike Ashley was a keen squash player whose injury sent him into retail, leading him to create one of Britain's most successful companies. Ranked as the 15th richest person in Britain with a £1.5bn fortune, he rarely gives interviews and is only seen publicly when watching Newcastle United, the football club he owns. At 24 he married Swedish born economist Linda, who he had three children with. They divorced in 2003, agreeing a £50m deal, one of the biggest settlements in British history. He left school at 16, became a squash coach after a bad injury ended his career, launched a sports and ski shop in Maidenhead in the 1980s and within a decade he had more than 100 UK stores. Now his Sports Direct brand has 400 stores, but he also owns brands like Dunlop Slazenger, Karrimor, Kangol, Lonsdale, and a stake in Umbro. Ashley also has a large stake in Blacks Leisure, the owner of Millets and is believed to own parts of JJB Sports and JD Sports. Having exposure to all these brands and shops is how he has made so much money, with experts saying his aggressive management style means 'he likes to park his tanks on peoples' lawns'. The private equity backed firm had been chaired by former Asda boss Andy Bond until a week before it failed. The sizable stakes of founders Tim Whitworth and Carl Brewins are thought to have been lost. Whitworth started-out as a Saturday boy in 1985 at what was then known as Just Jeans. The small retailer changed its name to Best Jeanswear in 1990 and became Republic in 1998. In 2005 private equity firm Change Capital, which counts former Marks & Spencer chairman Luc Vandevelde and chief executive Roger Holmes on its board, took a stake to help grow the chain. In 2011 TPG snapped it up for £300million, appointing former TK Maxx boss Paul Sweetenham as chief executive while Whitworth gave up day-to-day control. In January accountant KPMG was brought in to try to rescue the chain after sales fell off a cliff during the Christmas period. Its young customers have been hit hard by the downturn but the firm, which is predominantly based in the north of England, has also been slow to join rivals with a meaningful website. It came as the true scale of the devastation wreaked on the British High Street was laid bare yesterday as it was revealed that the number of store closures skyrocketed last year. A total of 7,300 High Street shops closed down in 2012, a net loss of 1,800 - compared with just 174 the year before. While most attention was focussed on the . troubles of a few high-profile firms, the real damage was done by . profitable businesses seeking to cut costs by trimming the number of . stores. A new report on Britain's 500 largest town centres by PwC and the Local Data Company showed that an average of 20 stores closed every day. Success: Sports Direct's share price is up a pound in six months - but down slightly today - as they continue to hoover up failing businesses and turn them round . Crisis: High Street vacancies have remained strikingly high since the start of the recession . Desolate: Britain's High Streets had 1,800 fewer stores at the end of last year as businesses shut down outlets . The squeeze on High Street chains is of course closely linked to the double-dip recession, but they are also under pressure from the relentless rise of online shopping. Last year saw well-known businesses such as Comet and JJB Sports cease operations, but even healthy firms closed branches in an attempt to keep costs down. However, there was a surprising increase in the number of independent shops, with 600 more appearing over the course of the year to take advantage of large chains' struggles.","The Newcastle United owner has bought up 116 stores that were to close .

It's not the first time Klay's father, who now works as a commentator with the Lakers, has been so outspoken about his son. When Klay was suspended as a college hoops star after he was cited for having marijuana on him during a traffic stop in 2011, he was suspended from the team and forced to miss the final game of the season.

A female employee with the U.S. Department of State who was vacationing in Brazil was found strangled in a hotel room in Rio de Janeiro last week, police revealed Thursday. Victoria Tcaciuc, 38, had been travelling through the South American country and was discovered by staff of the hotel, which is located in the Copacabana neighborhood. The Rio police homicide division have named Brazilian ex-firefighter Alessandro Rufino Oliveira Carvalho, 42, as the main suspect in the murder.

Victoria Tcacuic, a 38-year-old U.S. citizen and State Department contract employee was last seen going into a hotel in Rio de Janeiro on February 20; she was found strangled by hotel staff . Tcaciuc and a Brazilian ex-firefighter spoke with the Casa Blanca hotel clerk before going up to a room; the man claims that all Tcacuic wanted to do was smoke a cigarette and watch TV . Rio police homicide division have named Brazilian ex-firefighter Alessandro Rufino Oliveira Carvalho, 42, as the main suspect in the murder; security footage shows him leaving the hotel alone . Carvalho, who served eight years in prison for an assault charge, denies the murder charge and said that he left the American traveller alone and alive in her room on February 20. ‘In the hotel, all she wanted to do was smoke a cigarette and watch television,’ he said, according to Brazilian newspaper The O Globo. ‘There was no sex and when I left, she was very much alive.’ The two had apparently met at a crafts fair, had lunch, and went to the Casa Blanca hotel. Security footage shows the blonde Tacaciuc walking behind Carvalho into the hotel lobby. It appears that Carvalho did most of the talking with the hotel's attendant, at one point reaching for his wallet and handing the man several bills. Rivaldo Barbosa, the head of the city’s homicide division, told reporters: ‘We suspect that he killed her because she refused to have sex with him.’ Barbosa said Carvalho left the hotel less than an hour after entering and traveled to Sao Paulo. Carvalho was arrested Thursday when as he was returning to Rio. The two checked into the Casablanca Hotel on this street in Rio; a hotel worker later found her body in one of the rooms . The State Department worker was staying near the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, pictured, and had plans to visit four other locations in Brazil . It is unclear when Tcaciuc arrived in Brazil, but Barbosa said the woman was planning to visit at least four other cities before returning to the U.S. on March 4. She was divorced and had no children. The press office of the U.S. Consulate in Rio said Tcaciuc was a contract employee of the State Department. Citing privacy act considerations, the consulate did not provide her hometown or other information, though Brazilian reports state that she lived and worked in Washington, D.C. A State Department official told MailOnline in a statement: ‘We were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Department of State contractor Victoria Tcaciuc. ‘We express our deepest condolences to her friends and loved ones. Officials from the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro are providing all appropriate consular assistance,’ adding that local authorities were handling details of Ms Tcaciuc’s murder.","U.S. Department of State contract worker Victoria Tcacuic, 38, had been travelling around Brazil .

Nap in the nave: The Archbishop of Canterbury has confessed to dozing off and falling sideways during evensong at Coventry Cathedral . It is not surprising that some people admit to dozing off in the middle of a long church service but there is one man you wouldn’t expect to own up to a quick snooze in the pews. The Archbishop of Canterbury has confessed that he nodded off and fell sideways during an evensong service. The new spiritual leader of the world's 77 million Anglicans made the admission in his first major address since becoming archbishop at Coventry Cathedral, where he was once a canon. The Most Rev Justin Welby revealed that when he was leading evensong at the cathedral he fell asleep during the singing of Magnificat before being spotted by the verger, who stifled his laughter, despite the archbishop’s attempts to conceal his nod off. And this nap in the nave confession is not the first he has made. He laughed through a passage from the Old Testament forbidding the eating of ‘rock badgers’ while he was the Dean of Liverpool. When he became Bishop of Durham he was presented with a crozier with the face of a rock badger, which resembles a prairie dog, carved into it as a reminder of the day he lost his composure. The honest archbishop recently revealed that his ‘alcohol-dependent’ father had a secret life. The former oil executive learned that his father Gavin Welby was briefly married during a stint living in America and while there had an affair with the future US President John F Kennedy’s sister Patricia. He then returned to England and married the woman who became Dr Welby’s mother. The archbishop has been left wondering whether he might have a secret brother or sister. Letters have also revealed that the . bishop’s father introduced John F Kennedy to his first mistress, a . 21-year-old Swedish aristocrat, weeks before the future President’s . marriage to Jacqueline Bouvier. Nod off: Justin Welby (pictured being introduced to the Lords as Archbishop of Canterbury earlier this week) made his sleepy admission in his first major address since becoming archbishop at Coventry Cathedral . He also discovered that his enigmatic father’s surname was changed by deed poll from his birth name of Weiler. The son of a German Jewish immigrant, his father had disguised his real name and his roots. The deception meant that, when Gavin Welby died in 1977, his unsuspecting son gave inaccurate details of the father’s name and birth on the death certificate. The archbishop’s admission of sleeps in service came as he announced yesterday that he has appointed Rev Dr Jo Bailey Wells as his personal chaplain, becoming the first woman to take the post at Lambeth Palace. During his address, the archbishop said there was a culture of fear in the Anglican Church, with journalists, scientists, politicians, bankers and even bishops being mistrusted. Not his first admission: The Most Rev Justin Welby (pictured as he was received by the Queen earlier this week) once laughed through a passage from the Old Testament forbidding the eating of 'rock badgers' Secret life of us: The archbishop's father Gavin Welby (right with wife Jane and Justin at his christening in 1956) had an affair with the former US President John F Kennedy's sister Patricia .","The Most Rev Justin Welby made the admission in his first major address since becoming archbishop .

Police arrested Tracie Robinson - who coached dressage to the eventing performance team which won silver at the London 2012 Games - after a member of the public reported seeing her swerving across the road and mounting the pavement. The 52-year-old admitted she had been behind the wheel when officers knocked on the door of a house she had parked outside. When Robinson was breathalysed, she gave a reading of 92 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35. Robinson was banned from driving for two years and handed a year-long community with 80 hours of unpaid work. She was also told to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. She has been Team GB’s dressage trainer since 2001 and contributed to their eventual success in the London Olympics. Leicester Magistrates’ Court heard a member of the public called the police after seeing Robinson’s Land Rover Discovery weaving about the road in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, on January 22. Prosecutor Kwok Wan said: 'At about 11pm, officers at Lutterworth police station heard a loud bang and looked out of the window.

A man has been charged with the murder of his 17-year-old neighbour more than 30 years after the high school student was found dead in a ditch. Kenneth Lee Hicks, now 49, was a neighbour of Lori Billingsley at the time of her death in Oregon in October 1982. The teenage girl had been beaten, stabbed, strangled and sexually assaulted. At the time police had insufficient evidence to arrest Hicks - who was the last person to see Miss Billingsley alive and a prime suspect in the case - but this week saw him charged with aggravated murder following advances in DNA technology. Cold case: Kenneth Lee Hicks, now 49, has been arrested over the murder of his then neighbour, high school student Lori Billingsley, in Oregon in October 1982 . Hicks, of St Helens, was 19 when Miss Billingsley's body was found in a drainage ditch in Aloha, west of Portland. He pleaded not guilty to the charge yesterday, according to a Fox News report. Sergeant Bob Ray, from the Washington County Sheriff's Office, said evidence from the case had been submitted to the Oregon State Police Crime laboratory in 1991 as DNA was beginning to gain recognition as an investigative tool. But assessments yielded nothing concrete and the murder remained unsolved. In December 2010, retired sheriff's office detective Mike O'Connell returned to work on a part time basis and began looking into the 1982 murder. He went on to serve a search warrant to obtain Hicks' DNA in April last year. This led to Hicks' arrest on Wednesday, said Sgt Ray, who added that the work of the officer leading the investigation at the time of Miss Billingsley's death, the late Detective Jim Welch, had been 'invaluable' to the officers re-examining the case. 'The DNA was just the last piece of the puzzle,' he said. District Attorney Robert Hermann is set to act as prosecutor in the case he was assigned 30 years ago. The victim's sister Vickie Billingsley claims Hicks was 'infatuated' with her older sibling.

Taxpayer-owned shares in Lloyds Banking Group are close to being sold off by the Government, but at a far lower level than first thought, it emerged today. George Osborne is understood to have told the bank's board that when the price hits 61p, 7p more than its current level when the FTSE opened today, they will be cashed in. But it had been understood that the Treasury would not sell until they hit around 74p - the average price they paid five years ago. Lloyds is 39 per cent publicly-owned by after the Government was forced to step in to bail-out the bank with £5bn at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Scroll down for video . Sell off: After bailing out the bank in 2008 the Government is prparing to shed its 39 per cent stake in Lloyds Banking Group - which announced another huge loss today . It came as the bank announced losses of  £570million last year, down from £3.5billion in 2011. But despite this hit, boss Antonio Horta-Osorio has been awarded a £1.5 million shares bonus while staff will share a £365 million total pot. This is despite further losses in the wake of mammoth provisions for mis-selling claims. The taxpayer-backed bank remained in the red in 2012 after setting aside £3.6billion for compensation relating to the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal and £400 million for the mis-selling of interest rate swaps to small businesses. Lloyds said Mr Horta-Osorio's bonus has been deferred for five years and will only be paid out if shares reach and remain at 73.6p for a sustained period, or if the Government is able to sell at least a third of its stake at a profit. Staff will share out a £365 million bonus pool, down 3 per cent on 2011, giving each employee around £3,900 on average. Cash bonuses have been capped at £2,000. Mr Horta-Osorio insisted the group’s sale of more than 600 branches to the Co-operative Bank remained on track in spite of reports earlier this week that the Co-op is battling to plug a potential £1 billion capital hole discovered by the Financial Services Authority. He said the Co-op remained “absolutely committed to this deal” and confirmed Lloyds will be separating the branches under the TSB brand on the high street by August in preparation to be offloaded. Lloyds said losses narrowed significantly from £3.5 billion a year earlier thanks to improvements in its core business. But much of this was down to cost-cutting, as income fell 13 per cent amid historic low interest rates. Lloyds said it was very close to its original target to bring costs down to around £10 billion and was now hoping to cut costs even further, to £9.8 billion, in 2013. The group added that it boosted lending to small business by 4 per cent on a net basis and helped 55,000 customers buy their first home.","George Osborne will sell when shares hit 61 - around 7p above current level .

Grave: This is where Josi Roberto Pereira was buried alive by his girlfriend Graciele Tomaz in Marilac, Brazil . After Pereira fell asleep, Tomaz started beating him with a club, then tied him up with bedsheets and buried him in a 1m-deep grave. He was shocked to wake up and find he was surrounded by soil, but because his girlfriend had left part of his face uncovered he was still able to breathe. Tomaz, his girlfriend of three years, had also apparently stolen a mobile phone and the equivalent of £65 in cash from him. Pereira visited his local police station to report the crime, but when police ran his name through the computer they discovered a 14-year-old warrant for his arrest.

Spark: It was the conviction of choirmaster Michael Brewer (right), which led to the tragic death of victim Frances Andrade (left), and now up to 12 former staff being probed by police . Cover-up? Detectives have received more than 20 complaints about historic sexual abuse at Chetham's, pictured . Nearly all of the abuse is alleged to have taken place at Chetham’s - however it is believed some took place when complainants were pupils at the Royal Northern College of Music, also in Manchester. The allegations came to light after the trial of former Chetham’s choirmaster Michael Brewer, convicted earlier this year of indecent assault in the 1970s and 1980s. His victim, Frances Andrade, killed herself after giving evidence against him at Manchester Crown Court. A second music teacher, Wen Zhou Li, a . 57-year-old violin tutor from Cheshire who has worked at both Chetham’s . and the RNCM, has also been arrested on suspicion of rape before being . released on bail. No charges have been brought and Mr Li strenuously . denies the allegations. Paul Lewis, an acclaimed pianist who studied at Chetham’s in the 1980s, claimed ‘every pupil’ knew of the abuse. Former teacher Malcolm Layfield was accused by Frances Andrade . of preying on students. A former pupil has said there was a 'cover-up' Malcolm . Layfield, who was head of strings at the Royal Northern College of . Music, was accused by Frances Andrade of preying on students. He said he had resigned from the Manchester-based college as his position was ‘untenable’. Married . Mr Layfield, 61, taught at Chetham’s alongside Brewer. He has admitted . sexual relationships with at least six pupils, some of whom were just . 16. It was stated all the girls were over the age of consent and the ‘liaisons’ were ‘consensual’. The . news comes as more than 1,000 former Chetham’s pupils and professional . musicians signed a petition calling for an independent inquiry into . sexual abuse at the school and other private music conservatoires. The petition’s organiser, former . Chetham’s pupil and professional pianist Ian Pace, says he believes the . Brewer trial is just ‘the tip of the iceberg’. Mr Pace, now based in . London, said: ‘There has been a huge groundswell of support for the . petition from ex-Chetham’s pupils from all areas, including people who . have been there very recently. ‘A . lot of parents have also supported it, along with musicians of all . different types, plus people working in education and other musical . organisations. ‘The number of people contacting me to talk about these issues is also significant. ‘These . are problems which have gone unaddressed for too long, like the nature . of teacher-pupil relationships and abuse, whether it’s physical, sexual . or emotional, which causes long-term damage. ‘Unfortunately I think what came out at the Michael Brewer trial is just the tip of the iceberg.’ A spokeswoman for the RNCM declined to comment as did Greater Manchester Police. MailOnline approached Chetham's for comment, but they are yet to respond. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Includes permanent and casual staff from Chetham's - some still in schools .

"By . Tim Shipman, Geoffrey Foster and Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 18:34 EST, 24 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:43 EST, 25 February 2013 . George Osborne today refused to change course on his austerity plan despite the pound slumping to a new low today as investors reacted to the loss of Britain's gold-plated AAA credit rating. The Chancellor was called to the Commons this afternoon to be grilled by MPs after the UK's currency fell to its lowest level against the dollar for nearly three years and hit a 16-month low against the euro. The . pound fell sharply to $1.51 and was as low as 1.14 euros today, . compared with 1.23 euros earlier this year and close to 1.29 euros in . last July. It means that £500 in a UK tourist’s pocket is now worth just 570 euros – compared with €645 last year. Under fire: Chancellor George Osborne faces criticism from all sides after Britain lost its gold-plated AAA credit rating . By contrast, the FTSE 100 rose by more than 30 points, suggested that the downgrade did not come as a surprise to investors who had grown used to bad news from Britain after a run of disappointing economic announcements. Mr Osborne insisted: 'We will go on delivering on the economic plan that has brought the deficit down by a quarter.' He told MPs there had not been 'excessive volatility' as the markets gave their reaction to the Moody's decision. Sterling has been locked into a downward spiral over the past week amidst fears the Bank of England could re-start its quantitative easing programme, fuelling inflation. Mr Osborne told MPs the decision by Moody's was a 'stark reminder of the debt problems built up in Britain over the last decade and a warning to anyone who thinks we can run away from dealing with those problems'. However, Labour's Ed Balls noted that Mr Osborne Mr Osborne had made maintaining the AAA rating a key benchmark for his stewardship of the economy,. 'The first economic test he set himself, now failed by this downgraded Chancellor,' Mr Balls said. The FTSE, which is strongly . influenced by the performance of international firms, held on to its . recent gains, climbing 34 points to 6370 by 2.45 this afternoon. Sterling's continuing losses could . mean misery for holidaymakers, who have already seen the value of the . pound fall by seven per cent this year, and put an extra squeeze on . consumers by pushing up the cost of everything from petrol to pasta. In a fresh blow to the Chancellor, his Tory Cabinet colleague and former chancellor Kenneth Clarke admitted yesterday it will take ‘years’ to re-establish ‘sensible economic growth’ in Britain. And Business Secretary Vince Cable warned Mr Osborne that producing another ‘slash and burn’ austerity budget would be ‘utterly foolish’ and demanded more action on growth. In . signs of a growing Coalition row over the economy, Deputy Prime . Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘We’re not just balancing the books – we need . to do a whole lot more than that.’ Despite the downgrade, David Cameron's official spokesman insisted today that the Government's economic plan was 'working' and the Prime Minister remained committed to seeing it through. 'The plan is working and that is why we believe the economy is healing,' the spokesman told a daily Westminster press briefing. Treasury . sources say the Chancellor’s budget, due in three weeks, will be an . ‘unabashed budget for business’ and is expected to include corporation . tax cuts. But he faces the immediate prospect of a run on the pound after the downgrade by credit ratings agency Moody’s. Mr Clarke admitted the pound is no longer seen as a ‘safe haven’. He . told Sky News: ‘It’s going to take several more years of this in order . to get back not just our credit rating but to get back to sensible . economic growth.’ While . the problems set the stage for a crunch budget in three weeks time, Mr . Cable warned against £10billion of fresh cuts the Tories want to use to . balance the books. He said: ‘To embark on a slash and . burn policy in response to this would be utterly foolish and . counterproductive. The real thing we have to focus on is the real . economy and getting growth back.’ Citing as examples the US and France, . both downgraded last year, he also argued the loss of the AAA rating . was ‘largely symbolic’, adding: ‘In terms of the real economy there is . no reason why the downgrade should have any impact.’ Mr Osborne is also under fire from Tory MPs such as Adam Afriyie, who said they must cut taxes or lose the next election. The . Windsor MP and self-made millionaire called on the Government to phase . out employers’ National Insurance contributions and halve the . corporation tax on profits to 12.5 per cent. Others warned Mr Osborne is in the ‘last chance saloon’. One senior backbencher said: ‘Genius George must go.’ Another said: ‘He faces a fundamental issue of credibility.’ Foolhardy: The Chancellor chose to wear the rating as a badge of honour and must now live with the consequences after the downgrade . George Osborne has, in many ways, only himself to blame for the political backlash as a result of Britain losing its prized AAA credit rating. The Chancellor chose to wear the rating as a badge of honour, constantly referring to it as the rewards of Britain’s budgetary discipline. By doing so, he has been hoist by his own petard. In itself, the downgrade is of little consequence. Both the United States in 2011 and France last year lost their top-notch standing without any noticeable impact on their ability to borrow on global markets at very low rates. Britain will always be regarded as a good credit risk. This is because the average age of the nation’s bonds or gilt edged stock that issued is for 15 years – a far longer maturity than other leading nations. As a result the country is not constantly having to ask the market to buy newly issued bonds or gilts to replace old ones. Also, what sets the UK apart from Greece (and even Germany) is that we have never, in our entire history, failed to pay back our debt. The biggest risk for Osborne is that the loss of our credit standing leads to a lengthy and destabilising run on the pound. The currency has already fallen a sharp 7 per cent in value against the dollar and the euro since the start of the year. So far, this reduction has been viewed with quiet satisfaction by the Bank of England governor. Even though it means higher prices for imported food and energy, policy makers believe the best hope for restoring growth is a cheaper pound, making British goods and services more competitive in the global marketplace. But there is a very big difference between a gentle slide in the currency of the kind that has already taken place, and the panic-selling that occurs when the markets lose confidence in a nation’s ability to stabilise its affairs. Realistically, there is no reason for a run on the pound. However slow the UK’s economic growth and however big our debt mountain, the UK’s problems are as nothing compared to those of the wounded euroland. And if markets were rational they would take no notice at all of what the credit rating agencies have to say. After all, it was these very same organisations that stamped the toxic American sub-prime mortgage debt as AAA before the financial crisis. Nevertheless, it would be  irresponsible for the Chancellor if the weekend’s events were not to lead to some rethinking of economic strategy ahead of the budget. Osborne needs to do two things simultaneously. He needs to slash a welfare budget that is still increasing at an unacceptable pace and move rapidly to improve growth by getting the banks lending again to households and small businesses. Most importantly he needs to radically reform a tax system so onerous that companies move mountains to avoid paying tax and are refusing to invest in their businesses. The truth is that more imaginative policies are required by the Chancellor to rekindle growth in output and put the setback of a lost credit rating behind him. So far, truly bold initiatives have been sadly lacking when it has come to boosting output.","Sterling stands at $1.51 and €1.14 today after UK stripped of credit rating .

Srinivasa Ramanujan, described as a 'natural genius', has finally had the mathematical functions he came up with on his deathbed proved correct . Researchers have finally solved the cryptic deathbed puzzle renowned Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan claimed came to him in dreams. While on his death-bed in 1920, Ramanujan wrote a letter to his mentor, . English mathematician G. H. Hardy, outlining several new mathematical functions never before heard of, along with a hunch about how they worked, . Decades years later, researchers say they've proved he was right - and that the formula could explain the behaviour of black holes. 'We've solved the problems from his last mysterious letters,' Emory University mathematician Ken Ono said. 'For people who work in this area of math, the problem has been open for 90 years,' Ramanujan, a self-taught mathematician . born in a rural village in South India, spent so much time thinking . about math that he flunked out of college in India twice, Ono said. Ramanujan's letter described several new . functions that behaved differently from known theta functions, or . modular forms, and yet closely mimicked them. Functions are equations that can be drawn as graphs on an axis, like a sine wave, and produce an output when computed for any chosen input or value. Ramanujan conjectured that . his mock modular forms corresponded to the ordinary modular forms . earlier identified by Carl Jacobi, and that both would wind up with . similar outputs for roots of 1. Ramanujan, a devout Hindu, thought these patterns were revealed to him by the goddess Namagiri. Scroll down for video . Ramanujan claimed the patterns in numbers were revealed to him by a Hindu goddess . However, no one at the time understood . what Ramanujan was talking about. 'It wasn’t until 2002, through the . work of Sander Zwegers, that we had a description of the functions that . Ramanujan was writing about in 1920,' Ono said. Ono and his colleagues drew on . modern mathematical tools that had not been developed before Ramanujan’s . death to prove this theory was correct. 'We . proved that Ramanujan was right,' Ono says. 'We found the formula . explaining one of the visions that he believed came from his goddess.' The team were also stunned to find the function could be used today. 'No . one was talking about black holes back in the 1920s when Ramanujan . first came up with mock modular forms, and yet, his work may unlock . secrets about them,' Ono says. A highlight of working on a film about Ramanujan's life was getting to browse through some of the Indian master's original notebooks, said Ken Ono, right . 'Ramanujan's legacy, it turns . out, is much more important than anything anyone would have guessed when . Ramanujan died,' Ono said.

Not giving in: House Speaker John Boehner said that he feels the Republicans have done enough to help try to avoid the cuts and it not willing to concede to all of President Obama's requests . America is just hours from crippling spending cuts as Washington heads into the dreaded sequester at the stroke of midnight on Friday. The law simply says that 'on March 1, 2013, the president shall order a sequestration for fiscal year 2013.' That means that at any point in the day on Friday, President Obama can issue the beginning of the sequestration where all facets of government will be forced to cut a collective $85billion between that point and October 1. White House press secretary Jay Carney says that means midnight, Friday - or as close to midnight as possible- 11.59 p.m. and 59 seconds- because, Carney says, Obama is 'ever hopeful.' After failed attempts at reaching a compromise in order to avoid the $85billion in budget cuts that will go into effect on Friday, President Barack Obama and Republicans blamed each other for the latest outbreak of gridlock. The immediate impact of the reductions on the public was uncertain, and the administration pulled back on its earlier warnings of long lines developing quickly at airports and teacher layoffs affecting classrooms. Looming nightmare: The $85billion in spending cuts will begin to go into effect just after 11.50 pm on Thursday because the two sides were unable to agree to a compromise . Not good: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that the President had attempted to compromise but the Republicans would not allow for tax increases on wealthy corporations . Department of Defense . Homeland Security . Transportation and Recreation . Public Schools . Federal Workers . Health and Safety . '(Republicans) voted to let the entire burden of deficit reduction fall squarely on the middle class,' President Obama wrote in a statement in response to the inaction . On the Senate floor, a Republican . proposal requiring Obama to propose alternative cuts that would cause . less disruption in essential government services fell to overwhelming . Democratic opposition, 62-38. Moments later, a Democratic . alternative to spread the cuts over a decade and replace half with . higher taxes on millionaires and corporations won a bare majority, . 51-49, but that was well shy of the 60 needed to advance. Republicans . opposed it without exception. In a written statement after the votes, Obama lambasted Republicans. 'They voted to let the entire burden of deficit reduction fall squarely on the middle class,' he said. He . noted that he would meet with congressional leaders from both parties . at the White House on Friday, but no one is expecting action before the . cuts begin taking effect. The full brunt of the automatic cuts will be borne over seven months and Congress can stop them at any time if the two parties agree on how to do so. That makes it difficult to say how the belt tightening will hit ordinary Americans. President Barack Obama's administration is warning that Navy ships could lie idle and children would lose out on vaccinations if the cuts are not halted. 'Obama and Senate Democrats are demanding more tax hikes to fuel more ""stimulus"" spending,' House Speaker John Boehner said . Put into law in 2011 as part of a bipartisan solution to an earlier fiscal emergency, sequestration is unloved by both parties because of the economic pain it will cause. Few believed two years ago that the cuts would come into force but, unable to agree on any other way to reduce the budget deficit, political leaders are pointing fingers at each other now that the spending reductions appear inevitable. 'It is the president's sequester. It was his team that insisted upon it,' Republican House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Republicans' refusal to compromise by agreeing to close tax loopholes on the wealthy was one reason why the cuts might be unavoidable. 'Compromise represents willingness to accept policies that aren't 100 percent of what you want. The president has done that again and again. Unfortunately, Republicans seem to be unwilling to do that when it comes to the sequester, so the sequester may take place,' he told reporters. Obama wants to end tax breaks for oil and gas companies and the lower 'carried interest' tax rate enjoyed by hedge funds. Pink slips: Thousands are expected to be put on unpaid leave (furloughs) but Democrats are now painting the pink slips as coming from the desk of the Republicans . Carney said both sides had agreed to the . spending cuts, half of which will come from the defense budget and half . from non-defense domestic programs. 'It was designed as policy that would never come into effect. Because it was so onerous for both sides, it would compel Congress to reach a compromise,' Carney said. The cuts total $85billion through the end of the current budget year - September 30 - half each from defense and non-defense programs. Large parts of the budget are off-limits, including programs for veterans, Social Security and Medicare benefits. Though furloughs are a fear for some- especially certain federal workers- there is little sign of business worry, let alone panic in the nation. Stocks declined slightly for the day after trading near record highs. Unlike the 'fiscal cliff' showdown of two months ago, there are no deadlines for action to prevent tax increases from hitting nearly every American. Over the past two years, Obama and congressional Republicans have agreed to more than $3.6trillion in long-term deficit savings over a decade. None of the savings to date has come from the big benefit programs that lawmakers in both parties say must be tackled if the country is to gain control over its finances. Each party fears the political fallout of confronting them on their own, but Democrats, in particular, are reluctant to scale back programs that they count as their political birthright. While the White House has issued a steady stream of severe warnings about the impact of across-the-board cuts, the president said Wednesday night, 'This is not a cliff, but it is a tumble downward. It's conceivable that in the first week, the first two weeks, the first three weeks, the first month ... a lot of people may not notice the full impact of the sequester.'","Politicians imposed law two years ago that set today as the deadline to find ways to cut $85billion in spending, hoping that the two parties would find a way to compromise .

Jailed: Susan Gleeson, who is the mother of top rugby league player Sean Gleeson, banked tens of thousands from a multi-million pound heroin deal while living on benefits . The mother of a top rugby league player . was jailed today for banking tens of thousands from a multi-million . pound heroin deal while living on benefits. Former hairdresser Susan Gleeson, 51, whose son Sean plays for Hull Kingston Rovers, had joint control of an account that received £107,000, it was said. The money came from a £1.5 million heroin smuggling operation run by her husband Paul, 53, who is now serving a seven-year sentence for the crime. He admitted buying specially adapted MG cars that were used to transport 20kgs of the drugs into Britain. Rugby star Sean, 25, offered £50,000 to bail his father after his arrest but it was rejected by magistrates and Gleeson was jailed last March. Sean watched from the public gallery as . his mother was found guilty of money laundering and jailed for 15 months . at Canterbury Crown Court. Judge Adele Williams told her: 'Those . who help to launder the proceeds of drug smuggling and drug trafficking . commit a serious offence. 'The mischief is that traffickers . operate more easily if there are those who will assist them in . converting the proceeds of their deals. 'You assisted your husband - and . you have been convicted on clear and compelling evidence - by paying . money into your join account to purchase the two MG motor cars used by . the courier and the purchase of the Mercedes. 'You enjoyed the trappings of . these proceeds, the many holidays, going to Las Vegas, The Canaries, . Greece and the Dominican Republic.' The jury heard how officers raided the family's £190,000 home in Wigan, Lancashire, in September 2011 and uncovered her lavish lifestyle - despite being on unemployment benefits. They found five flat-screen TVs, a £12,000 18 carat diamond ring, four bottles of champagne, evidence of five luxurious holidays and a £20,000 Mercedes sports car. They also found Cartier and Armani watches and a top-range hi-fi. Star: Mrs Gleeson's son Sean, pictured with ball in hand, is a top rugby league player with Hull Kingston Rovers . The garage also contained 62 kilos of hand-rolled tobacco worth around £18,600. Christopher May, prosecuting, said the Gleesons had run a window manufacturing business which went bust in 2007. He said: 'Despite there being no visible legitimate sources of income, substantial amounts of money were being credited to their account, in addition to the benefits. 'There appears to have been no reduction in lifestyle, which included foreign holidays from the point at which the family business folded up. 'The Crown's case is that the explanation for the unexplained income into the Gleeson household is that Paul Gleeson was involved in criminal activity; including drug smuggling.

More than £63,000 was withdrawn in cash.' Mrs Gleeson claimed the money had either come from her husband's window fitting work, from savings accounts or from Sean. But the court heard she knew her husband had been previously jailed in 1997 for six years for smuggling £6m worth of cannabis into the UK. Mr May added: 'It is the prosecution case that very substantial amounts of money were flowing through the hands of the defendant, which had not been derived from the family double-glazing business or any visible legitimate sources of income.' Mr May said the Gleesons together with Sean and his girlfriend went to a garage and handed over £20,000 in cash in two payments for the Mercedes. Sean - who played for Ireland in the 2008 World Cup - told the court he had no idea his father was dealing in heroin. He said he had been planning to buy his own car when his father persuaded him to contribute to a present for his mum. He said: 'I gave £7000 towards it because I was living at home at the time and my dad said it would be a present for mum.' Sean, who has just signed a three-year deal with Hull KR., also said he had bought two houses in 2009 and 2010 and paid his father £7000 to renovate the properties. He also said he paid his parents up to £200 a month for his 'keep' as he lived with them.

Baroness Lane-Fox will be joined in the . upper chamber by composer and BBC Radio 3 presenter  Michael Berkeley, the . independent House of Lords Appointments Commission said. Mr Berkeley said: 'Naturally I feel very honoured to be appointed to the House of Lords and I am particularly pleased that the Appointments Commission was keen to increase representation in the field of music and the arts.'

"By . Louise Boyle . UPDATED: . 19:28 EST, 8 September 2011 . David Beckham's brother-in-law was forced out of his job in the City for not arranging meetings for clients with the footballer and his family, a tribunal heard. Darren Flood, 32, of Goff Oaks, Hertfordshire, claims he was asked by his boss Tony Herbert to use the relationship to arrange trips to Los Angeles and Milan. When he didn't, Mr Flood alleges he told him he 'wasn't good enough' to be a part of the famous family. The broker is married to Victoria Beckham's sister Louise. They were wed in 2009 in a ceremony at the Beckhams' Hertfordshire mansion. Darren Flood (left) leaves an employment tribunal in London yesterday with his wife Louise (right), the sister of Victoria Beckham . Mr Flood, who has an Indian grandfather, claims he was also racially bullied, taunted and 'belittled' about his background by Mr Herbert - who 'insisted' he was in charge of ordering takeaways for colleagues if it was curry and said he was going to buy him a beaded car seat 'like Indian cab driver'. The broker, who had worked for Canary Wharf-based consulting firm BGC International since he was 18, told the East London tribunal the bullying increased after he raised issues about alleged 'dodgy' trading practices within the company, to which they turned a 'blind eye.' Mr Flood was also struggling financially, having complained about the level of bonus he was receiving. David and Victoria: Mr Flood claims he was routinely told to set up client meetings with his famous relatives by his London broking firm . When the taunts eventually got on top of him and he handed in his resignation, he was offered a salary of £75,000 with a Christmas bonus of £25,000 if he stayed on for another three years. However, he refused as, having already had three children with Louise, he was 'already breaking into savings to survive.' Reading his witness statement to the tribunal Mr Flood, who was supported by his wife Louise and Victoria's father, said: 'My partner and I got together in 2007. 'My sister and brother-in-law are Victoria and David Beckham, a fact which is well known in the company. 'Tony Herbert knew this and attempted to use it to the advantage of the clients, asking for trips to Los Angeles and Milan. 'I didn't want to exploit the relationship and said I would see what I could do. When it never took place he took to belittling me and saying I was not good enough for the family.' He also described an additional time when, after a charity event, Mr Herbert's boss Nick Ruddell came up to him, smelling strongly of alcohol, and said 'I should make sure David attended their office the following year.' Referring to the alleged racist abuse, Mr Flood continued: 'Tony Herbert frequently referred to my Indian heritage. 'It was not unusual for the desk to order a takeaway on Fridays and he always insisted I order it if it was a curry. He told me he was going to get a beaded car seat like Indian cab drivers.' He further referred to numerous occasions where he was called a c**t by Herbert, at one point in front of the entire office. After Herbert had screamed, 'f**k you, you c**t, all pay rises are off the table' he said: 'I took this to be the final straw. 'I had told him before not to use such language, but he had not done so. I felt completely undermined. I felt that I could not continue to work for this man. 'I have thought about this a lot and with the benefit of hindsight I believe that after failing to introduce clients to the benefits of Mr and Mrs Beckham, Tony Herbert wanted me out. '[The respondent] is alleging that offensive language is commonplace in the industry. That to a certain extent is true. It is not the language that caused me offence, it was the fact that it was aimed directly at me. 'I do not believe any employee should be subject to racism, no matter how much they are being paid. After working for the company for 11 years, Mr Flood eventually handed in his resignation on November 3rd, 2008, and raised his formal grievance in March the next year. Mr Flood is claiming unfair dismissal. The hearing continues.","Darren Flood, who is married to Victoria's sister, also claims he was victim of racial abuse ."

A triple killer who complained about being subjected to 'excessive searches' in jail is attempting to sue the Prison Service over alleged infringements of his human rights. Kevan Thakrar, who is currently serving three life-sentences, is taking legal action over, what he claims are, illegal practices in prisons. Thakrar wants to bring a case against the Prison Service using the European Convention on Human Rights. The 24-year-old claims his rights are being breached involving his privileged correspondence with lawyers, his private use of telephones and prison visits with his legal team. Ms Flo Krause, who represents the complainant Thakrar, told the Civil Courts of Justice in Manchester that her client has also complained about 'excessive searches' while in jail. Thakrar, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, must serve a minimum of 35 years before parole can be considered and is currently held at HMP Woodhill, a category A jail, in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. He was jailed along with his brother Miran in 2007 for the gangland-style execution of three drug dealers. Keith Cowell, 52, his son Matthew, 17, and Tony Dulieu, 33, from Essex, were killed at the Cowells’ house in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire. The Thakrars were also found guilty of the attempted murders of Christine Jennings, 54, and Matthew Cowell’s girlfriend, Clare Evans, 23, at the house. The men had met at the house to do a cocaine deal, but Miran Thakrar, a small-time drug dealer, was angry he had been sold poor quality cocaine previously by the Cowells and was out for revenge. Thakrar is currently held at HMP Woodhill (pictured), a category A jail, in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire . Miran Thakrar shot the family dog and then lined up Keith Cowell, Matthew Cowell and Mr Dulieu, and shot them dead as his brother Kevan looked on. The brothers also shot and stabbed Christine Jennings and attacked Clare Evans with a knife as she tried to shield her three-year-old daughter. The case was described by trial judge Mr Justice Cooke as a 'cold-blooded multiple murder carried out in a savage way'. At today’s preliminary hearing in Manchester before Judge Waksman QC, sitting as a judge of the High Court, the court heard the brief grounds of Thakrar’s claim is that either national or local prison polices are unlawful and infringe his human rights involving his legal letters, use of telephones and visits. It is understood Thakrar will claim that under the European Convention on Human Rights, while in prison his rights under Article 6, rights to a fair trial, and Article 8, right to respect for one’s private and family life, are both being broken. Jonathan Auburn was present at the hearing as lawyer for the Secretary Of State For Justice, who will defend the prison authorities when the case comes to trial later this year. If Thakrar wins his case, he will be able to sue the authorities for damages. Last November at Newcastle Crown Court Thakrar was cleared of two counts of attempted murder and three counts of wounding with intent after an incident at Frankland Prison in County Durham. He admitted lashing out with a broken bottle and injuring three prison guards but the jury agreed he acted in self-defence in a 'pre-emptive strike' after suffering years of alleged racist bullying. A two-day trial to hear Thakrar’s human rights case has been set for October 11.

Residents of Berlin are up in arms at new plans to demolish part of the city's famous wall in order to build luxury flats. The proposal to obliterate a key monument from Germany's history and replace it with accommodation to the super-rich has met with widespread outrage. However, the mayor of the district where the demolition is planned insists that it is necessary to connect the east and west sides of Berlin better. Watching on: Police guard the East Side Gallery while tourists are photographed during a press conference held by the group 'Mediaspree versenken!'

Police guard: Members of local action groups and a commission of clubs neighbouring the Spree border at the former Berlin Wall's death zone are protesting against the planned demolition of parts of the East Side Gallery . For the three decades that it cut the city in half, the Berlin Wall was a global symbol of oppression and the divide between the communist and capitalist halves of the world. But since the city was united in November 1989, what remains of the wall is considered to be an important monument to Germany's torrid history. In addition, the 0.8-mile of wall known as the 'East Side Gallery' is thought to attract as many as 1,000 visitors per day. The wall is covered in vivid graffiti, much of which was painted by some of the world's leading street artists. Controversial: Policemen walk past a part of the East Side Gallery in Berlin as protests were held against the planned demolition of parts of the Gallery in order to construct luxury apartments . Iconic: The 'East Side Gallery' is known as a leading display of street art since the fall of the wall . However, part of the wall is set to be torn down to give access to 'Living Levels', a 200ft skyscraper being built on a strip of land between the wall and the Spree river, according to The Local. The tower will be divided into 36 luxury flats which are set to sell for up €7,000 per square metre (£560 per square foot). Franz Schulz, mayor of the . Friedrichshain district, told Die Welt that part of the wall would have . to be demolished to connect his area with the neighbourhood of . Kreuzberg.

A new bridge, the 'Brommybrücke', will span the Spree and provide a further link between the two formerly divided parts of Berlin - but can only be built if a section of the East Side Gallery is removed. Locals have circulated a number of petitions protesting against the planned demolition, arguing that it would transform the historic and public nature of the area. Nearby nightclubs, representing the traditional Bohemian lifestyle enjoyed by West Berliners during the Cold War, have also joined the protests against further development.","Residents protest against plan to knock down some of 'East Side Gallery'

'I don't really need a curfew,' Miami teen Keith Steart told NBC Miami, 'but I do feel that a curfew is important because young kids like my age are dying in the streets.' 'You don't know what's going on,' said Pete Soriano of Team Pete Sports. 'You've got drug dealings, you've got shoot outs, kids getting killed left and right.'

It is unclear which presenters in particular are angered but the station's talent includes Simon Mayo left and Chris Evans (right) But when presenters heard about the idea of also putting up a score out of 10 for their show they reacted with anger. Insiders branded the suggestion ‘astonishing’ and said it was treating its presenters as if they were children. One insider added there were also a ‘lot of angry producers’ over the plans as well. One source told a website: ‘It’s reducing the whole thing to numbers. The idea that you can measure the success of a programme by a series of integers, it feels as if you are being treated like a child. ‘The things that really matter aren’t measurable. A presenter could hit all their numbers and still have a dull programme. Or they could miss all the targets but be making great radio.’ However it emerged last night that the idea of scoring its presenters has not been taken forward by bosses, perhaps in the light of the frosty reception it got from DJs.

'There was blood covering the stairs, there was blood covering the door...and on the walls on either side.' The teen's body was found lying face down between the living room and the kitchen. 'He had been stabbed in the back far enough through to hit vital organs,' said Hogan. 'He had been stabbed in the head, and one of those stab wounds actually penetrated his skull. His throat was cut from the midline all the way across.' Kevin Allen was stabbed over 20 times, had his throat slit and then was set on fire as he was robbed of $350 . Police found evidence of defensive wounds on Allen's hands, showing that he tried to fight his way out of the situation. 'He was fighting for his life,' said Hogan. 'He did not want to go down this way.' Police recovered evidence from the scene including several kitchen knives and several empty bottles of cooking oil, all with blood on them. According to Hogan, the oil had been used to burn the body. The subsequent police investigation led them to Carter, who was known to Allen and who had traveled with him on a bus on the evening of the attack. Police have theorized that Allen may have been speaking to a friend on his cell-phone and divulged that he was going to his house to pick up money his dad had left for clothes. Surveillance video reportedly shows Carter with Allen on the bus and then a while later on his own counting a stack of money. 'What's the value of a young man's life today?' Hogan asked reporters at the Wednesday morning press conference. '$350, sadly is the value of a young man's life today. And that is a tragedy.'","Shakeem Carter has been charged with the murder of Kevin Allen in which he allegedly stabbed him 20 times and then set his body on fire in Norristown, Pennsylvania .

Martin Heaver, jailed for six months for fraud, bought paratrooper garb off eBay to carry out his con . A conman who pretended to raise money for a dying girl who did not exist has been jailed for six months. Martin Heaver, 46, posed as a war hero and even bought a paratrooper T-shirt and beret from eBay in order to give his 'web of lies' more credibility. Heaver asked people for sponsorship for a series of skydives to raise money for a desperately ill five-year-old girl. He claimed he wanted to raise enough cash to make the girl's dying wish to meet Mickey Mouse at Walt Disney World in Florida come true. But the girl never existed and Heaver pocketed between £900 and £1,000 from around 100 unwitting members of the public. The father-of-four, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, was jailed for six months at Lincoln Crown Court yesterday after he admitted fraud. Sentencing him, Judge Sean Morris described Heaver's acts as 'despicable'. He said: 'You conned people into believing you were raising money for a little girl to send her to Florida to see Mickey Mouse, presumably, before she passed away. 'I can't think of anything as low as that. 'The sentence will seem very low as I'm obliged to follow the guidelines. 'Frauds such as these will make people sceptical about giving and in these hard times people need charities.' The court heard Heaver approached factory workers telling them he was fundraising for a little girl from Waltham on the Wolds in the Vale of Belvoir in the East Midlands. He told them she knew she was terminally ill but wanted to meet Mickey Mouse before she died. Matthew Lowe, prosecuting, said: 'There was no five-year-old girl who was terminally ill, there were no parachute jumps and the money he obtained ended up in his own pocket. 'One of the locations he went to for sponsorship was a factory in Kettleby in Melton Mowbray where one supposes those providing money were not on huge salaries. Judge Sean Morris told Heaver his acts were 'despicable' as he passed sentence at Lincoln Crown Court . 'He indicated her dying wish was to see Mickey Mouse and he wanted to raise funds to enable her to do that.' Heaver was described in court by his defence as a 'Walter Mitty' character - a fictional character with a vivid fantasy life in James Thurber's short story The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. He had previously received a 14-week suspended prison sentence in 2004 for stealing £12,000 from his then employer, G4S.","Martin Heaver, 46, said the girl wanted to meet Mickey Mouse before she died .

A self-confessed child hitman has been found murdered in Mexico today after police were forced to return him to his mother because he was so young. The body of Jorge Armando Moreno was found alongside five others, who had been tortured, killed and dumped at a busy roadside. He had confessed to taking part in at least 10 assassinations and killing three people himself for the violent drugs cartel Los Zetas when he was arrested earlier this month.

But authorities in the central state of Zacatecas were forced to release him because of his age, and his body was found this morning next to a main road. The bodies of four unidentified women and a man, which all displaying signs of torture, were found alongside him around 10 minutes drive from the state capital Morelos. It is thought that one of the victims may be Moreno's mother. State prosecutor Arturo Nahle, who described Moreno as 'extremely dangerous' after his arrest on February 3, said: 'It would have been better for him if we'd been able to keep him in custody.'

He was sentenced to three years in jail in July 2011, aged just 14, for homicide, kidnapping and drugs and weapons possession. Jimenez was arrested when he was just 12 for crimes which included the beheading of four people and the hanging of their headless corpses from a bridge. He confessed after his detention to working for the South Pacific drug cartel. American-born Jimenez was arrested in the border town of Tijuana on the way to his stepmother's home in San Diego.

'Sweet': Schoolboy Amar Diarrosova, six, was hit on a crosswalk a block from his school in Manhattan while the crossing guard was taking a break . A six-year-old boy died after being knocked down by a truck as he crossed a busy intersection just one block from his school while the crossing guard was on a break. Amar Diarrosova was walking to school with his older brother in East Harlem, Manhattan, yesterday morning when he was hit by the trailer of the truck as he crossed First Avenue. The crossing guard tasked with monitoring the spot was on a bathrooom break when the 'sweet' schoolboy was hit by the vehicle turning right onto the avenue from 117th Street, police in New York said. Amar and his nine-year-old brother were just one block from P.S.155 William Paca when the little boy was struck by the trailer of the truck, according to an NBC News report. Amar was taken to Harlem Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The older boy was unharmed. Officials told NBC 4 New York that the 55-year-old crossing guard, named as Flavia Roman, was allowed the short personal break, but did not note it in her memo book. She is understood to have been suspended from her post for 30 days without pay. The driver of the McLane Foodservice Distribution truck was cited for failure to yield and failure to exercise due care, said police. Amar's parents were too distraught to talk to reporters, saying only that their older boy was 'OK, thank you' when asked how his brother was after the accident. Maya Toure, a family friend, said Amar was a 'sweet boy' who loved school and 'prayed a lot'. City Councilwoman Melissa Mark Viverito questioned whether there are sufficient crossing guards in place at the busy intersection to keep children safe in the wake of the tragedy. 'People have to take breaks,' she said. 'People are working and they're out on the street and they have to do what they have to do.

Sadly, after another few minutes some of the helper dolphins left, and the injured female soon dropped into a vertical position. Despite the best efforts of the remaining helpers, who appear to try and prop her up, keeping her head above the surface, she soon stopped breathing. According to the researchers who filmed the pod of dolphins, five of the creatures stayed with it and continued touching its body, until it sank out of sight. The dolphins move into help the troubled female and within half an hour they have grouped together in what appears to be an effort to save her life . Soon the creatures have formed a raft around their stricken pal as they try to keep her above water . Sadly, the pod were unable to save the creature and she slipped below water and out of sight . Karen McComb at the University of Sussex in Brighton told the New Scientist: 'It does look like quite a sophisticated way of keeping the companion up in the water. 'It makes a lot of sense in a highly intelligent and social animal for there to be support of an injured animal.' But Ms McComb said while the images suggested the dolphins understand when others are suffering, and can even empathise, the dolphins could have been trying to keep their group member alive to retain control of their territory. There have been examples of single dolphins helping others, generally mothers helping their calves, but no cases of groups of dolphins working together to help another. Dolphins are also believed to mourn their dead, after researchers witnessed them interacting with the corpses of dead group members.","Footage shows 12 dolphins swimming very close together, in South Korea .

A disabled woman was barred from a tribunal to decide whether she was entitled to benefits – because she was in a wheelchair. Sylvia Middleton, 65, was turned away by security staff in case a fire broke out in the five-storey building. It later emerged that wheelchair users have been denied entry to Acorn House in Basildon, Essex, for three months over the misplaced health and safety concerns. They included others attending disability tribunals and workers attempting to visit offices in the mixed-use block. Ridiculous: Court officials at Acorn House in Basildon banned Sylvia Middleton, 65, from attending her own disability tribunal because she was in a wheelchair . ‘They said they couldn’t guarantee my . safety and they didn’t let my wheelchair upstairs,’ said Miss Middleton, . who was summoned to the fourth-floor hearing by the Department for Work . and Pensions to be reassessed for Disability Living Allowance. ‘Why are they holding disability tribunals in a building disabled people aren’t allowed in?’ Divorcée Miss Middleton has been without her £50-a-week payments since . December 2011 when they were suspended after an ‘administration error’. She has been managing on her £140-a-week pension in her two-bedroom . bungalow in Pitsea, Essex, while waiting for the  benefit to be . reinstated. After she and her son, Peter, were refused entry on February 2 she was . told she would have to wait another two months for her case to be heard – . this time 12 miles away in Southend. Apology: This is a letter which was sent to Ms Middleton by the tribunals service . The mother of two developed crippling arthritis in her knees, neck and back after a 30-year career as a factory worker. ‘What angers me is that I am not one of those people who wants to sponge off the state,’ she said. ‘I have been working since the age of 15 – I had my two children and went straight back to work. Angry: Sylvia Middleton, 65, was told she could not attend the fourth-floor courtroom for a hearing to reinstate her disability living allowance due to barmy health and safety fears . ‘I got a job packing boxes but my arthritis got so bad I couldn’t stand . up any more. I was assessed and the doctor said I needed help.’ Other wheelchair-bound people who have been banned from the building include office worker Paul Peterson, 33. He said: ‘I was a bit taken aback because I’ve worked here for 11 years and spent at least eight of them on the first floor. ‘A security guard told me I wasn’t allowed upstairs because they needed . to build an external lift to evacuate people in wheelchairs in the event . of a fire. ‘I thought that was a bit odd because they always tell you not to use lifts if there’s a fire. ‘We’ve actually got an evacuation chair right next to my desk in case there’s a fire,’ he added.

When Daddy needs a publicity boost for his latest store opening, his little girl knows exactly what to do. Topshop heiress Chloe Green simply wheels out her latest beau for the cameras. Her latest accessory is 44-year-old Latin singer Marc Anthony, ex-husband of Jennifer Lopez and a father of five – just the sort of man guaranteed to attract maximum attention. At 21, Chloe is a mere two years older than his oldest daughter. The 21-year-old was pictured cuddling up to Anthony just days after her father Sir Philip Green opened a new Topshop store in Los Angeles. The singer, who holds the accolade of top-selling tropical salsa artist of all time, was apparently not just there as an ornament. He wasted no time in telling his 3.2million Twitter followers that he had had the ‘time of my life’ in the new store at The Grove shopping centre in LA. He wrote: ‘Who ever doesn’t know about #Topshop #Topman in LA has to get on it! Just had the time of my life at The Grove. Amazing!’ The couple have not been dating for long, according to sources, but Anthony is simply the latest in a long line of celebrities to get up close and personal to Miss Green. Coincidentally, a new man seems to arrive on the scene every time she or sometimes he, could do with a little extra publicity. Two months before she signed up to take part in Made in Chelsea she enjoyed a fling with two of the stars of the reality TV show. In June 2011 she was linked to Spencer Matthews but by July had moved on to Ollie Locke. Old friends: Singer Jennifer Lopez, ex-husband Marc Anthony, Chloe Green and Sir Philip Green sit together at a restaurant in 2009 . By September her romance with Mr Locke was over. She was, however, still in the show and pictured out and about with actor Lucien Laviscount, who no doubt was looking to boost his profile after a stint on Celebrity Big Brother. Shortly before the launch of the shoe collection she designed in May 2012, she was pictured hugging Premier League footballer Jermain Defoe in the street. And in December last year, shortly before the Christmas shopping rush, Miss Green was seen with football ‘bad boy’ Djibril Cisse.

Anthony is apparently friends with Chloe’s doting father Sir Philip. In April 2009, when still married to Miss Lopez, he was pictured chatting to Chloe, then 18, and Sir Philip  during a Topshop dinner in New York. Sir Philip invited Miss Lopez and Anthony on to his yacht on the French Riviera in May 2010. Miss Lopez also joined the Greens at the Los Angeles launch party of Topshop just two weeks ago. Anthony split from model girlfriend Shannon De Lima a month ago, but clearly has wasted no time in moving on. Miss Green joined him and his five-year-old twins Max and Emme, from his marriage to Miss Lopez, on a day out at Disneyland in LA. The heiress, who turns 22 tomorrow, looked relaxed in a double denim combination of Topshop jeans, Current Elliott shirt, Victoria Beckham sunglasses and black biker boots from her own CJG collection as she held hands with her new man. Anthony, who split from Miss Lopez in 2011, is also father to Cristian, 12, and Ryan, nine, from his first marriage to beauty queen Dayanara Torres. He has a daughter Ariana, 19, from a previous relationship with Debbie Rosado.","Chloe Green's latest accessory is 44-year-old Latin singer Marc Anthony, .

But none of the diners at Bompas & Parr's feast for the Andaz hotel's recent 5th birthday celebrations could have predicted that they would be joined at pudding by such unexpected guests. Following a spectacular two-course meal at the Liverpool Street hotel curated by the pair, better known for their ingenious jelly sculptures, diners were invited to ascend to a futuristic fantasy room where a table had been laid, imagined by Bompas & Parr as a dining experience might be in 2113. The table, which at first glance seemed to be rendered in bright pink perspex, soon transpired to be a 20ft long pool of liquid upon which floated slate mats laden with a cornucopia of colourful treats. Striking: . The stunning pink room was the third location for the three course, . three venue meal, which started in the hotel's dining room, had the main . course in the mystical environs of the Masonic Temple and ended in the . futuristic room . Brave: One diner plucked the leech from the water and was rewarded with a gentle bite. Right, the leeches swam between the slate plates and even wriggled up on top . Glasses of dessert wine were submerged in the liquid, appearing to be just a quarter of an inch full. But when lifted, guests were rewarded with a hefty measure of the wine. Orbs filled with tart rhubarb and creamy custard were floated between diners like little futuristic vessels; rubix cubes of exotic fruits were laced with absinthe, lemongrass and sour cherry using loaded pipettes. Already it was a sensory experience like no other. But the piece de resistance, and the moment that will forever be remembered by all present, was when a shiny, slippery black leech darted past one of the diner's plates, cutting through the surface of the pink liquid as it went. Moments later, it had wriggled and . writhed its way up onto one of the slate plates and one of the more . courageous diners had plucked it from the pink puddle where it lay and . was now showing it to the rest of the guests. Reader, I confess here I, as I think they say in the business, lost it. Thirsty? One adventurous leech creeps towards the dessert wine . Surprise: . What looked at first glance to be a shiny pink perspex or glass surface . turned out to be an opaque pink liquid with leeches swimming within . Futuristic: The fantasy room was set up to host the sort of feast culinary creatives Bompas & Parr imagine we will be enjoying in the year 2013 . While others scooped around in the creepily opaque pink depths to find their own leech, I shot 10ft backwards in my chair, clutching at the damp bits on my wrists where the water had splashed up, yelping (screeching?), 'Is it on me? Is it on me?'. Needless to say it wasn't, and once I'd calmed down, I enjoyed watching the little creatures swimming merrily around as we ate the delights they'd have given their only sucker to nibble on. Nebular jellies, binary macaroons, those rhubarb and custard spheres, and a 2002 Patricius from Tokaj, Hungary, to top it all off. At the end of the night there only remained a quick last minute check for lingering leeches before we reluctantly slipped back to the 21st century.

A 66-year-old Florida man used a bottle of window cleaner to fearlessly disarm a home invader armed with both a gun and a crowbar. Jacques Baillargeon, a 28-year veteran of the Royal Canadian Mountain Police, said when the armed man appeared in his Southern Florida home on Tuesday morning he grabbed the first thing he could find while resolving, 'no way this guy is going to touch my wife.’ 'I said, ""…I will try not to panic and I will try to knock him down,""' Mr Baillargeon recounted from his Lauderdale Lakes condominium to WSVN. Scroll down for video . Invasion: Jacques Baillargeon, left, a 66-year-old veteran of the Royal Canadian Mountain Police, said that when Nathanel Smith, 29, right, appeared armed in his home he immediately grabbed an item to attack . That first thing was a bottle of blue cleaning liquid, a product Mr Baillargeon hastily sprayed into the man's eyes. Often containing ammonia, alcohol and sometimes vinegar, the product can cause a burning sensation when touching the eyes. Reacting the intruder swung his crowbar at Mr Baillargeon who was able to avoid the blow and instead swipe the weapon out of his hand. The intruder never fired his weapon but instead quickly fled the scene, leaving behind the crowbar as well as a skull cap. Weapon: Grabbing a bottle of blue window cleaner Mr Baillargeon said he sprayed the chemical, pictured, in the burglar's eyes and blocked his swing of a crowbar . Mr Baillargeon promptly called 911 who reacted in disbelief of his story. 'You sprayed him with window cleaner?' a dispatcher asked. In a shocking twist, only moments later the Broward police department were on the line with another call reporting a home robbery in the same area. At that alleged incident a crowbar and a skull cap were said to have been taken. Police say that caller, Nathanel Smith, 29, falsely reported the items later found in Mr Baillargeon's home in hope of explaining why his fingerprints and potential DNA were on them. 'Did you see anybody, can you tell me what they looked like?' police dispatch asked him. Serial robber: Police say Smith, seen in court, has admitted to the robbery as well as a second to a 61-year-old couple only two days earlier . 'No ma'am, He had on a black, he had on all black with a bandana over his mouth,' Smith said. Smith was detained by detectives after pulling a bag of marijuana out in front of them from his pants' pocket. Police say he later confessed to trying to rob Mr Baillargeon as well as another couple a few days earlier. Noon on Sunday a 61-year-old couple were similarly robbed inside their home after, like Mr Baillargeon, they left their door open to enjoy the cool air from outside. 'A black male armed with a handgun and crowbar entered their apartment and ordered the couple to lie face-down on the bed,' the Broward sheriff's department said in a press release.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said politicians had to do the right thing for their children . Voters must not ‘dare’ to criticise senior politicians who send their children to private schools, Education Secretary Michael Gove has warned. The senior Tory leapt to the defence of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, who has admitted that he and wife Miriam and considering not enrolling their eldest son into a state secondary school. Maria Hutchings, the Conservative candidate in tomorrow’s Eastleigh by-election has also faced criticism for saying her son needed to go to a private school to fulfil his ambition of becoming a surgeon. But Mr Gove, who is responsible for 25,000 state schools in England, insisted politicians should be free to choose private education for their children. ‘I would defend anybody who makes any decision about a child's education in their interests,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘I think it's terrible politics to drag people's children in and try to make an issue out of it.’ He added that many senior Labour figures had chosen to send their children to private schools. ‘There are all sorts of politicians from Diane Abott to Harriet Harman to Tony Blair who made the right decision for their kids. How dare people criticise a parent for doing what's best for their child? ‘If you try to get party political advantage out of a mother's love for their child that's just wrong.’ Last month Mr Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, signalled that he may send his eldest son to a private school, potentially sparking controversy about his commitment to state education. The Deputy Prime Minister said he would put his children’s education first and would not overrule the wishes of his wife or son for ‘political reasons’. Mr Clegg and his Spanish wife, Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, have looked around several schools, including the exclusive Catholic state school The London Oratory and a £30,000-a-year independent school. Nick Clegg and wife Miriam have viewed several schools and have refused to make their choice based on 'political reasons' David Cameron insisted he was ‘committed’ to sending his eldest daughter Nancy to a state school as in London ‘there’s a real improvement taking place’. But Mr Clegg refused to make the same pledge when quizzed about his 11-year-old son Antonio, who is due to start secondary school in September. Mr Gove defended Mr Clegg, and insisted politicians had to do the right thing for their children. He said: ‘Nick Clegg should send his son to the right school for his son. I would absolutely defend him whatever he chose to do. A parent's first responsibility is to their child. ‘If it works out to send them to a good state (school) we will do so but, like all parents sending their children to secondary school in London, as you know there is huge competition for places.’","Michael Gove leaps to the defence of Nick Clegg who has hinted his eldest son might not attend a state school .

Starting young: Austin's first cigarette was an unfiltered Camel stolen from her father while she was in junior high . Debi Austin, the star of the most famous anti-tobacco commercial ever, passed away Friday after decades of battling the chronic health issues left to her by a three-pack-a-day smoking habit . America first met Austin as she picked up a lit cigarette and took a long drag through the hole in her throat. In the commercial, she said she started smoking when she was 13 and they told her nicotine wasn't addictive. 'How can they say that?' she asked as smoked curled up around her face. The mid-90s ad turned her into a hero for the anti-tobacco movement. She died Friday at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys at the age of 62 following a 20-year battle with cancer. The LA Times reports she was born in April 1950 in Illinois and her family moved to Los Angeles when she was 4. She had her first drag of a Camel unfiltered while walking home from junior high. She'd stolen it from her father. By high school she was smoking a pack a day, and the habit got worse as she went to UC Berkeley and later managed a private telephone company. Towards the end of her habit she was burning through two to three packs a day. Scroll down for video . Educator: Austin later visited schools warning about the dangers of tobacco as well as filming two more commercials . In 1992 she found a small lump in her jaw and was diagnosed with Cancer of the larynx. - Smoking  can also lead to coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. - Tobacco deaths outpace those related to HIV, illegal drug use, alcohol, motor vehicle injuries, suicides, and murders combined. - Smoking reduces circulation by narrowing the blood vessels, thereby putting smokers at risk of developing an obstruction of the large arteries in the arms and legs which can result in pain, tissue loss, and gangrene.- Smoking causes an estimated 90 per cent of all lung cancer deaths in men and 80 per cent of all lung cancer deaths in women.- Smoking causes roughly 90 per cent of all deaths from chronic obstructive lung disease.- Smoking can increase the risk of coronary heart disease or stroke two to four times over.- Smoking is responsible for about one in five deaths annually in the U.S., totally 443,000 people. - On average, smokers die 13 to 14 years younger than nonsmokers. It was not her first smoking-related health issue. In the early 1980s she was treated for a chronic sore throat. She had a laryngectomy to remove the tumor and her vocal chords, and . learned to talk again using esophageal speech, or 'burp talk.' She agreed to make the commercial after seeing her 4-year-old niece draw a black dot on her own throat and say: 'I want to be like you.' Austin said she was 'well compensated' for the commercial and finally quit smoking eight months after it was first broadcast. Austin's ad is 'the most-recognized and talked about California tobacco control ad,' according to a statement from the State Department of Health, released after her death. 'Debi was a pioneer in the fight against tobacco and showed tremendous courage by sharing her story to educate Californians on the dangers of smoking,' Dr. Ron Chapman said in the statement. Austin then traveled around the state to tell young people about the dangers of tobacco, and made two more anti-smoking ads that aired in 2011. Her health had been forever crippled by her nicotine habit. 'I have a constant upper-respiratory infection. I have . emphysema and they want to put me on oxygen but I refused, because once . you’re on it you stay on it. So I have to have forced air at night,' she told the LA Times in an interview about the 2011 campaign. 'I am the worst-case scenario that your mother told you about,' she said. 'I am the walking dead, the cast-off of the tobacco industry that they can't fix, they can't heal.' She later joined a support group for people who'd undergone the same surgery. 'I'd never met or heard anyone who'd had a laryngectomy,' she told . The Times in 1997. 'I thought, 'Omigod, I make my living on the . telephone and now I'm going to sound like Elmer Fudd on Thorazine for . the rest of my life.'' Famous: State health officials said Austin's commercial was the most recognizable anti-smoking ad ever produced . Bad habit: Austin smoked for decades, continuing to smoke through the hole in her throat even after being diagnosed with cancer . She is survived by her sisters, Jamie Marshall of Portland . and Deena White of Canoga Park; and brother, Jim Gardner of Camp . Verde, Ariz. 'True to Debi’s spirit, she was a fighter to the end and leaves a big . hole in our hearts and lives,' the family said in a statement to ABC News.

Russian police raided a play featuring the trial of the three members of punk collective Pussy Riot, in what a government critic said was part of an anti-Western campaign promoted by President Putin. Moscow officers interrupted the performance  in central Moscow, and cautioned the Swiss director for violating visa rules, earlier today. The play features the recent trials of three members of Pussy Riot for staging a profanity-laced protest in Moscow's main cathedral last February. Russian raid: Moscow police interrupted a play featuring the trials of Pussy Riot members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, right, Maria Alyokhina, centre, and Yekaterina Samutsevich . Accusations: Ex-deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov, pictured in 2010, claim the raid on the theatre was part of an anti-Western campaign promoted by Vladimir Putin . Former deputy prime minister and Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov, said the raid on the theatre was part of an anti-Western drive fostered by President Vladimir Putin. ‘Our leadership is suffering a grave form of spymania and the fight against the West has become a number one priority in its domestic and foreign policies,’ he said. Federal Migration Service officers delayed the performance of ‘Moscow Trials’ at the capital's Sakharov centre for one hour as they issued a verbal warning to director Milo Rau, local news reported. The trials and convictions of Maria Alekhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova over their ‘punk-prayer’ in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, became international news last year and the ‘Free Pussy Riot’ campaign gained support from high-profile celebrities such as Madonna, Sting and Paul McCartney. Yekaterina Samutsevich was later released on appeal but both Ms Alekhina and Ms Tolokonnikova are serving sentences in Russian work camps for 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred'. Government protest: Opposition activists carry portraits jailed feminist punk band Pussy Riot members Maria Alekhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, during a protest in Moscow yesterday . Punishment: Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, was last month sent to hospital with exhaustion after being overworked at the prison colony where she is serving her sentence . During heir trial, the trio said the protest was meant to draw attention to close ties between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Kremlin. Russia's relations with the West have cooled since Putin returned to the presidency last May. In January Russia banned adoptions of children by U.S. parents in response to U.S. legislation imposing visa and asset restrictions on Russians accused of violating human rights. Russia has also forced non-governmental organisations receiving overseas funding to register themselves as ‘foreign agents’. The migration officials raiding ‘Moscow Trials’ were accompanied by Cossacks, a traditionalist group whose recent revival has been encouraged by Putin, according to Publicpost.ru and twitter reports from the scene. No formal punishment was imposed on Rau for allegedy violating visa conditions, Interfax quoted Sergei Kalyuzhny, the Federal Migration Service's deputy head as saying. ‘He entered (Russia) on a business visa, which does not allow any working activity,’ Kaluzhny said. Putin's return to the presidency last year was soured by the biggest political protest over the past decade, which analysts say led the Kremlin to ramp up nationalist rhetoric.","Play featuring trials of Pussy Riot members raided by Moscow police .

Banned low quality meat stripped from the bones of slaughtered animals is being sold to the UK's sausage makers using a loophole in the law, it emerged today. The scraps, known as mechanically separated meat (MSM), are given names like '3mm mince' so it can avoid an EU ban and is ending up in British food, experts say. A year ago Brussels told the Government that MSM could no longer be categorised as meat in all EU member countries and if used it had to be listed separately on the label. But in the latest twist in the food . labelling scandal gripping the country it appears the 'leftovers' are . being widely re-branded and then sold to British producers as meat. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scandal: banned cheap cuts scraped from the bones of slaughtered animals is being sold into Britain under various names, especially in teh sausage industry, it emerged today . The controversial product was used widely . in beef burgers and ready meals. Experts say the ban means that MSM was probably replaced with horse meat by producers bent on cutting costs, who then put it in lasagnes and burgers being sold in UK supermarkets. Today one of the UK's biggest sausage makers admitted they are using '3mm mince' and traders say it is being sold into the UK by European slaughterhouses under various names. It is also known as Baader meat, named . after a company in Germany that produces a meat mincing machine that . can strip membrane and sinew from bones, but claims 'it is meat!'. They have sold 5500 of their machines tp food producers in more than 100 countries. The system uses a 'squeezing belt that feeds the product to a perforated drum and presses the soft components through the holes of the drum. The solid components remain outside the drum,' their website says. Emails seen by the BBC show that companies across Europe are trying to sell this product in Britain. One pork supplier from Germany said: 'My information is that you only have to declare MSM, and Baader no.' One chicken suppler said: 'Declarable MSM is derived from chickens with all the meat and skin in . its original format and minced via the Baader machine, all the bones are . separated mechanically. This format can be declared as meat in the . ingredients.' Controversial: This version of a 'Baader machine' strips meat from animal and fish bones and produces a fine mince that spills out of the side . The 'desinewed' meat at the centre of the row is made from any flesh left on bones after slaughtering removed by spraying it with low-pressure water. It was introduced into the UK in the 1990s and the end product is . similar to a very fine mince. Another more high pressure technique, which produces a meat 'slurry' or paste, was also used to  bulk-out burgers, sausages and pies in Britain until April 2012, when the labelling law and ban was brought in. The EU treat both processes the same, but it appears it may still be hidden inside cheap foods and not labelled as required legally. Minced beef and lamb produced this way . were banned completely over fears it could spread BSE, but not pork, . chicken and other meats. Managing director of Poultex Mark . Fiddy, a British-based meat and poultry trader admitted: 'We supply that . product, I can't say who we supply it to or what they do with it, but . we supply that product. 'Well . we buy and sell it, we're not responsible for the end labelling and . what goes on meat contents and things like that,' he said when asked by . the BBC if it is being put in food secretly. The . UK's biggest private frozen sausage company, Freshlink Foods, said in a . statement: 'Some Baader meat is used in our own branded product that . goes into the foodservice market. Where used, this is clearly declared'. Northern Irish sausage maker Kevin McWhinney has been campaigning against these meats for years. The UK should not be using this Baader meat but as far as I am aware it is coming into the country and is being used,' he said. A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency told MailOnline: 'Knowing that a product is ""Baader meat"" is not enough to decide whether it is legal or illegal. Baader meat is a generic term used to describe the product of a mechanical separation process using a Baader machine. This product can fall into various categories under EU food law, depending on the raw material used, so can be used legally by food businesses in certain circumstances.' Discovery: A billboard showing a hot dog is seen in a parking at the Ikea store in Stockholm as the furniture giant announced it was withdrawing wiener sausages in the UK after tests found 'indications' of horse meat . Furniture giant Ikea yesterday said it is withdrawing wiener sausages in the UK after tests found 'indications' of horse meat just days after it withdrew a batch of its traditional meatballs. The announcement came hours after the boss of Tesco was forced to admit he still could not guarantee that all of his products contain exactly what is on the label as he fought to reassure the public over the scandal. Ikea said it was removing its sausages from sale in Britain, France, Spain, Ireland and Portugal after tests confirmed 'a few indications of horse meat'. A spokeswoman said: 'Based on some hundred test results that we have received so far, there are a few indications of horse meat. 'Together with the Swedish supplier in question we have decided to withdraw from sales also the wiener sausages ... from that supplier.'

Stephane Hessel, the concentration camp survivor who inspired the Occupy Wall Street movement has died aged 95. Mr Hessel who was a member of the French resistance passed away overnight in Paris according to his wife. As a spy for the French Resistance, he survived the Nazi death camp at Buchenwald by assuming the identity of a French prisoner who was already dead. As a diplomat, he helped write the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And at age 93, after a distinguished but relatively anonymous life, he published a slim pamphlet that even he expected would be little more than a vanity project. But Mr Hessel's 32-page Time for Outrage sold millions of copies across Europe, tapping into a vein of popular discontent with capitalism and transforming him into an intellectual superstar within weeks. Translated into English, the pocket-sized book became a source of inspiration for the Occupy Wall Street movement. In the book, Mr Hessel urges young people to take inspiration from the anti-Nazi resistance to which he once belonged and rally against what he saw as the newest evil: The love of money. The book, called Indignez-vous in French, had an initial run of 8,000 copies in 2010 and sold for 3 euro ($4, £2.60) before becoming a best-seller. Unexpected bestsller: Mr Hessel's 32-page Time for Outrage sold millions of copies across Europe, tapping into a vein of popular discontent with capitalism and transforming him into an intellectual superstar . Man behind the movement: Translated into English, the pocket-sized book became a source of inspiration for the Occupy Wall Street movement . Born in Germany, Mr Hessel and his parents immigrated to France in 1924, where they settled into an avant-garde life, hanging out with artists like Alexander Calder and Marcel Duchamp. Mr Hessel fled to London to join the resistance led by Gen. Charles de Gaulle in 1941, but sneaked back into occupied France on a spying mission in 1944, where he was arrested by the Gestapo and shipped off to the Nazis' Buchenwald concentration camp. At the camps he was waterboarded by the Gestapo during torture sessions. The day before he was to be hanged, he swapped his identity with another French prisoner who had died of typhus. Charity drive: Mr Hessel speaking at the headquarters of French charity association Emmaus . As a French diplomat after World War II, Mr Hessel joined a panel that included former U.S. first lady Eleanor Roosevelt which wrote up the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Mr Hessel 'leaves us with the invaluable heritage of fighting for universal human values and his inalienable sense of liberty,' Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe said today. A proud Socialist, Hessel said the aim of Time for Outrage was to convince adrift or discouraged young people that they can change society for the better - even if they feel the world is controlled by entrenched and financially powerful interests. But he hardly expected it would find a large audience in France, much less elsewhere. Mr Hessel said he purposely offered no solutions.

'I am not giving them a meaning, but I am saying: `Do try to find for yourself what would be meaningful.'' French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Mr Hessel had succeeded in that goal. 'In France, in Europe, in the world, Stephane Hessel was the spirit of resistance incarnate,' he said. 'For every generation, for young people, he was a source of inspiration but also a reference. At 95, he embodied faith in the future of this new century.' 'I'm eagerly awaiting the taste of . death. Death is something to savor, and I hope to savor mine. In the . meantime, given that it has not yet happened and that I'm generally . getting around normally, I'm using the time to throw out some messages,' Mr Hessel told RTL radio in 2011.","A German by birth, he was imprisoned in Nazi camps during World War II .

A toddler bled to death on a hospital's high dependency unit because of a delay in life-saving surgery and a 'complete failure' of communication between doctors, an inquest has heard. Tharun Umashankar, aged two, died from bleeding of the stomach lining which was probably caused by his intolerance to milk. He was rushed to Sheffield Children's Hospital, where he had been been receiving treatment for the previous two weeks after vomiting blood. Despite having suffered a previous large internal bleed he was not slated for an endoscopy to look at his digestive system until the following day - a delay that proved fatal. Tharun Umashankar died from bleeding of the stomach lining, which was probably caused by a milk intolerance . Independent expert Dr David Crabbe, a paediatric surgeon said the procedure would have found the bleeding and Tharun could have had a life-saving operation to remove part of his stomach. He told the Sheffield inquest: 'What was a complete failure was the lack of collaboration between surgeons and gastro-enterologists. Closer teamwork would have resulted in a different outcome.' Tharun's distraught mother Sentamil, 38, broke down and sobbed as she told the hearing: 'I believed they would cure him and make him well.' The young boy had had three endoscopies at the hospital in the previous fortnight after vomiting blood and suffering stomach pain but was thought well enough to be discharged on Friday, July 9, 2010. Consultant paediatric gastro-enterologist Dr David Campbell, who was in overall charge of Tharun although off duty that weekend, said he left instructions to be called if the boy had a serious bleed again. Mrs Umashankar, who also has two daughters aged seven months and seven, left with her son but during the night he vomited blood again. 'He cried and I felt he was in pain,' she said. 'His body was cool and exhausted.' Tharun's parents Setamil (left) and Sivananthan, moved from Barnsley to London after the tragic loss of their son . Tharun was rushed by ambulance to . Barnsley District Hospital and several hours later was transferred to . the Children's Hospital unit on the afternoon of Saturday, July 10. Mrs Umashankar said after doctors checked her son she noticed his nappy was 'full of blood' which she was worried about and claimed the wet bed covers had to be changed at least five times by nurses. 'A nurse told me it was a good sign as the blood was coming through his faeces and not the mouth,' she said. Tharun should have had an endocopy as soon as he was readmitted to hospital on the Saturday afternoon. Instead he was monitored as his condition worsened, an inquest heard. He died the next day . Mrs Umashankar was then told by staff that Dr Campbell would perform another endoscopy on Tharun at 8am on the Sunday morning. But in the middle of the night she noticed his stomach was distended and 'swollen like a bubble.' A doctor thought it might simply be a build-up of gas but at 4am Tharun vomited blood again. The mother said 'all the doctors were in panic and confused' by 6.30am at which time Dr Campbell arrived. 'I was really pleased, I believed he was going to save my son,' Mrs Umashankar said. But despite a blood transfusion, Tharun failed to respond and he died at 9am on the Sunday. Paediatric registrar Dr Tafadzwa . Makaya, whose job was to stabilise the boy, told the Sheffield inquest . she had not been informed of any ""red button plan"" to alert Dr Campbell . and a surgical team if there was a further bleed. When . she first saw Tharun he was sat up in bed watching CBeebies on a . monitor with his mother and appeared stable. She was only called by a . nurse at 4.30am when he vomited blood again. She . instructed he be given more fluid as he had low blood pressure and a . raised pulse, called for closer monitoring and ordered some units of . blood which should have been ready but were not so fresh ones had to be . made up. Dr Makaya said she alerted both the . surgical and medical registrars to the situation and was told Dr . Campbell would be coming in as planned to carry out an endoscopy at 8am. When . coroner Chris Dorries pointed out that Dr Campbell had asked to be made . aware if there was any further bleeding she replied: 'There was no red . button plan delivered to me.' Dr . Michael Powers QC, for the family, put it to Dr Makaya: 'Knowing that . this is a significant bleed, you didn't make any contact with anyone . anywhere until 6.15am.' She replied: 'I assessed and I managed and then I contacted my superiors.' Tharun died at Sheffield Children's Hospital (pictured). A lack of teamwork between surgeons and gastro-enterologists was partly to blame, an inquest heard . Specialist paediatric registrar Dr James Pauling said he arranged for Dr Campbell to do the endoscopy on Sunday morning and there was no contingency plan in place. He said: 'I don't recall him saying he had to be called back in the event of further bleeding.' He himself was not told of any further fresh bleeding which could have been a 'serious finding.' Mrs Umashankar and her petrol station cashier husband Sivananthan, 42, ran a grocery store in Barnsley at the time but after the tragedy moved to live with relatives in Tooting, London. They came to the UK 12 years ago and are British nationals. Dr Crabbe who reviewed the case said Tharun had a 'mighty strange illness' for a child and he had not come across such a case of catastrophic upper gastro-intestinal bleeding in a child before. He said the Children's Hospital was unique in that Tharun was admitted to the care of paediatricians rather than surgeons. The boy should have had an endoscopy on the Saturday which was an ""error of judgment"" by the doctors caring for him. 'The benefits of identifying the cause of the bleeding far outweigh the potential risks,' he said. 'I would say Dr Campbell was taking a risk.' The inquest was adjourned.","Tharun, two, had three endoscopies after vomiting blood but cause of bleeding not discovered .

The invasion of Iraq led by U.S. troops, in coalition with the UK and other nations, began on 20 March 2003 on . the basis of preventing Saddam Hussein's regime from using the weapons of mass . destruction it supposedly possessed.

Three independent reviews commissioned by then health minister Lord Darzi were produced by top consulting firms . Labour was accused yesterday of suppressing damning reports revealing a ‘culture of fear’ in the NHS five years ago which critics say could have saved lives. Months before the scandal at Mid Staffordshire was uncovered, three independent reviews commissioned by then health minister Lord Darzi were produced by top consulting firms. However, they were never published after they heavily criticised management culture and relentless pursuit of targets. One involving interviews with dozens of individuals across the Health Service, by the US-based Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), described in raw terms how ‘the NHS has developed a widespread culture more of fear and compliance than of learning, innovation and enthusiastic participation in improvement’. It said: ‘The patient doesn’t seem to be in the picture. We were struck by the virtual absence of mention of patients and families in the overwhelming majority of our conversations.’ One NHS worker told the authors: ‘The risk of consequences to managers is much greater for not meeting expectations from above than for not meeting expectations of patients and families.’ Most damningly, it noted: ‘Because of the fear of what will happen if targets are not hit, it’s not uncommon for managers and clinicians to hit the target and miss the point.’ Charlotte Leslie, the Tory MP for Bristol North West who is calling for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson to resign, tackled David Cameron about the ‘dangerous’ culture they revealed at Prime Minister’s questions yesterday. She called for an investigation into why the reports were not published, saying: ‘Had they not been suppressed, thousands of lives could possibly have been saved.’ Mr Cameron said: ‘I will look carefully at the issue. Where there is bad practice and where things are going wrong, we need to shine a very bright light on it and make sure not only that we deal with it but that we hold people to account.’ Miss Leslie, who has attacked Sir David for presiding over a ‘catastrophe’ at Mid Staffordshire, now has more than 30 MPs backing her early day motion calling for his resignation. Catastrophe: Charlotte Leslie (left) is calling for the NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson (right) to resign . She said the reports – which were commissioned for the 60th birthday of the NHS and produced in January 2008 – had been ‘covered up’. ‘They commissioned them to be published, expecting it to be a fantastic news story. But they found that beneath their gleaming language and some rigging of statistics, patients had suffered in a very bad way. ‘So they swept these reports under the carpet and pretended these catastrophic failings, leading to thousands upon thousands of unnecessary deaths, were not happening.’ The IHI report noted that while NHS funding had nearly trebled over the previous decade, in many areas it had failed to raise standards. Another report by the highly-respected Joint Commission International, an independent consulting firm, identified ‘a pervasive culture of fear in the NHS and certain elements of the Department of Health’. A third report, by the Rand Health group, said that while mortality statistics prepared for staff to look at were high quality, there seemed to be no awareness of them. When the reports were uncovered by Freedom of Information requests in 2010, the Department of Health insisted they had never been intended for publication and had fed into a number of recommendations for the Health Service published by Lord Darzi a year later – although none was mentioned by name. An adviser to Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham said yesterday: ‘They fed into the Darzi review which was published and was a key moment of our latter years, and new quality controls were enacted as a result. There was no sinister cover-up.’ Lord Darzi, an eminent surgeon, wrote of the need to restore quality to the NHS. He quit the following year in a move seen as a major blow to Gordon Brown.","Three independent reviews were commissioned by then health minister Lord Darzi .

Fidgeting, snoring, passing wind and hogging the duvet - the list of things that couples argue about in bed is endless. More than a quarter of British couples spend so much time bickering between the sheets that they are losing an average of 90 minutes sleep each week, new research suggests. The problem is so big that the sleep loss builds up to three full days of missed sleep during a year. A quarter of British couples spend so much time bickering in bed that they lose 90 minutes sleep each week . The research by hotel chain Travelodge also revealed that couples in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow are the worst bedtime bickerers – in Birmingham couples lose as much as three hours and 20 minutes sleep a week because of arguments. The survey of 2,000 British couples also discovered that 26 per cent argue in bed at least three times a week and that each squabble lasts about 30 minutes. The biggest cause of the arguments is fidgeting, with a fifth of Britons reporting that their partner regularly interrupts their sleep with restlessness and twitchy movements. Fidgeting . Snoring . Different body temperate . Hogging the duvet . Not being in the mood for sex . Passing wind in bed . Partner keeping the light on . Watching TV while partner wants to sleep . The time couples go to bed . Allowing children or a pet to share the bed . The second most common cause of . fights is snoring – 16 per cent of couples stated that they argue about . it - and men were revealed to be the worst offenders. The survey also found that couples . argue about incompatible body temperatures, duvet hogging, not being in . the mood for sex, passing wind, allowing pets into the bed and leaving . the light on. Corinne Sweet, relationship psychologist, said: ‘Bedtime bickering is a serious issue that needs to be addressed immediately. ‘Ignoring the issue will result in regular bursts of poor quality of sleep, increased stress levels and loss of immunity. ‘So serious is this problem that over an average relationship period of twenty years, British couples could lose two months sleep which does not make for long term bliss.’ She added: ‘My advice is that bickering couples should make time and have an open and honest discussion with their partner about their annoying sleeping habits. ‘It is only by having a frank conversation can they really work through the issues and identify a workable solution.’","More than a quarter of British couples argue in bed three times a week, each argument lasts 30 minutes .

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge faced fresh anguish over privacy today after Italian and Australian magazines published photographs of pregnant Kate in a bikini and more publications round the world lined up to do the same. Palace sources condemned the ‘violating’ pictures, which show the couple walking along a beach while holidaying on the secluded Caribbean island of Mustique. MailOnline understands publishers in the . United States, France and Germany have also bought the set for more than £100,000 in total. Italian gossip magazine Chi, which caused outrage when it published a photograph of Princess Diana as she lay dying, splashed pictures of the duchess and her growing baby bump across its front page. Australian magazine Woman's Day has also printed the pictures, as well as photographs of Kate's sister Pippa in a bikini, claiming they were taken by a member of the public on a public beach. Editor Fiona Connolly said the royal couple are not a  ‘protected species’ outside Britain adding: 'This is not a hard decision. Kate's on a public beach, there are other holiday-makers there and she looks fabulous.' However, Mustique is a private island and there is an expectation of privacy for anyone holidaying there because the paparazzi is banned. Pregnant: The Duchess of Cambridge, seen here with her husband at the unveiling of her picture at the National Portrait Gallery, has been photographed on holiday in Mustique . Kate, who is about four months pregnant, is wearing a bright blue halter-neck bikini with her slightly rounded stomach clearly visible. Her arm is draped over her husband’s shoulders while William, who is wearing blue baggy shorts and sunglasses, has an arm protectively around his wife’s back. The headline on the front of Chi, which goes on sale today, reads ‘Kate and William – honeymoon for three’. Woman's Day editor Fiona Connolly said she had no qualms about running the pictures, insisting they were taken by a fellow tourist on Mustique – and not a paparazzo. They have published a poster today showing pictures of Kate to promote their next edition, which is out on Monday. ‘She is on a public beach and she was mingling with holiday makers,’ she said. Luxury Island getaway: The couple are staying at a £5million, five-bedroom mansion, one of the most opulent on the island . She told News Ltd that there were other tourists in the photos and ‘it’ s a very different situation to the nude photos.’ This was a reference to photos of Miss Middleton taken by a French photographer last year and which caused distress to the Duchess and Prince William. Royal storm: Australian magazine Woman's Day has produced this poster advertising their next edition out on Monday . ‘There is no photographer hiding in the bushes and she is not inside a private villa,’ said Miss Connolly. St James’s Palace has angrily hit out at the impending publication of the photos in Europe as ‘a clear breach of the couple’s privacy.’ But Miss Connolly said Australians did not view the royal family as a ‘protected species’ like the British. ‘The British have a great deal more sensitivity to royals than we do here in Oz,’ she said. ‘As Australians, we see this every day. We see pregnant women in bikinis on the beach - and a public one at that - so we are a lot less sensitive here. 'Our readers are going to love these photos. I don't expect any backlash at all really. I think she's looking fabulous and healthy and (with) a beautiful bump, like we haven't seen her before. Kate ‘looks so much better than the poorly and sickly woman we saw coming out of hospital, which makes these photos more of a celebration,’ she said. It is not known how much the magazine has paid for the exclusive Australian rights to the photos, which, said Miss Connolly, would eventually be published around the world. ‘Everyone but the UK has or will publish these pics,’ she said. It is not the first time an Australian magazine has published photos of royals against the wishes of the royal family. One of the most controversial decisions was made by New Idea magazine - engaged in a bitter publication war with Woman's Day - which revealed in 2008 that Prince Harry had been posted to Afghanistan, putting the royal at risk. Last night, royal sources said William, in particular, still felt ‘very bruised’ about the fresh breach of privacy so soon after the same magazine splashed topless photographs of Kate across its front page beneath the headline ‘the queen is naked’. Safe haven: Mustique is well-known amongst celebs as a place to go to avoid media intrusion . The source said William felt very strongly at the time that he had somehow ‘failed’ to protect his wife.The intimate photographs are thought to have been taken from a boat using a long lens camera. Chi magazine, which is owned by former Italian prime minister . Silvio Berlusconi, boasts: ‘The extraordinary images of the Duke and . Duchess of Cambridge on their dream holiday in the Caribbean. ‘The future mum, now four months pregnant, wore a tiny bikini which showed off her visible bump.’ The photographs are believed to have been offered to several other magazines around the world and could fetch up to £250,000. Members of the Middleton family have accompanied the couple on their holiday. (L-R) Carole, James, Michael and Pippa . Yesterday a spokesman for St James’s . Palace said: ‘We are disappointed that photographs of the Duke and . Duchess on a private holiday look likely to be published overseas. ‘This is a clear breach of the couple’s right to privacy.’ A . palace source said: ‘It’s violating’. The duke and duchess, who are . expecting their first child in July, flew to a £19,000-a-week luxury . villa on the island of Mustique last week. In the wake of the Princess Diana's 1997 death, when the car she was in crashed while being pursued by papparazi, the Royal Family has asked the media to limit its intrusion into the private lives of the aristocracy. A Royal spokesman once said: 'Members of the Royal Family feel they have a right to privacy when they are going about everyday, private activities. 'They recognise there is a public interest in them and what they do, but they do not think this extends to photographing the private activities of them and their friends.' The UK media has for the most part observed this request. When the topless pictures of The Duchess surfaced, no UK newspapers or magazines published the images, even though they had spread all over the internet. Similarly, only the Sun published the naked pictures of Prince Harry as he partied in a Las Vegas penthouse. However, the right to privacy has been a source of contention between the press and the Royals. Clarence House once even refused to reveal the name of Kate and William's new cocker spaniel puppy, calling it an invasion of their privacy. Kate finally revealed the name of the black pup three weeks after royal aides refused to confirm it. She told schoolchildren in Oxford it was called Lupo (Italian for wolf) while on an engagement. The Royal couple are two of the world's most recognisable people but it can be a struggle to guard their privacy . Kate’s parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, and her sister Pippa, flew out at the same time and are renting a villa nearby. It is understood that bikini photographs of Pippa are also being touted for sale. Mustique, . a private island with just 74 villas and one small hotel, is where . Princess Margaret once had a holiday home and is frequented by stars . including Mick Jagger. Kate . and William, who were accompanied by a team of bodyguards, have chosen . the island for seven of their last eight holidays because of the privacy . it affords them.

Paradise: Mustique is a private island in the Caribbean where Princess Margaret once had a holiday home . Famed for its palm-fringed beaches . and upmarket watering holes, Mustique is one of the most exclusive . holiday destinations in the world. The . tiny Caribbean island was made famous in the 1960s when its owner, Lord . Glenconner, gave the Queen's late sister, Princess Margaret, a 10-acre . plot of land as a wedding present. Lord . Glenconner bought the island, which had been left to wrack and ruin . following the decline of the great sugar plantations in the 19th . Century, for £45,000 in 1958. In the early days, life on the island was simple: with little fresh water and dusty tracks for roads. But the eccentric Scottish noble struck on the idea of parcelling up and selling off small pockets of land to carefully vetted buyers.Princess Margaret commissioned theatrical designer, Oliver Messel, to build her a villa, Les Jolies Eaux. She adored Mustique because it was somewhere she could let her hair down away from prying eyes and public scrutiny.Visitors included her cousin Lord Lichfield, who had a villa nearby, gangster John Bindon - with whom Princess Margaret is rumoured to have had an affair - and Mick Jagger.It was here, too, that she conducted her long relationship with Roddy Llewellyn, a landscape gardener 17 years her junior.Princess Margaret gave Les Jolies Eaux to her son, Lord Linley, when he married in 1998, but, much to her distress, he quickly sold it.In 1989 Mustique Island was transformed from a family estate into a private limited company - The Mustique Company - with the 100 or so homeowners as shareholders.Its status as a private island means that the paparazzi are banned - making it a Mecca for celebrities including Mick Jagger and David Bowie.

The island's only watering hole, Basil's Bar, and its legendary 'jump-up' sees rock and roll stars sipping rum punch next royalty without a care in the world. Wealthy holidaymakers are attracted by the island's balmy climate and beautiful beaches. There is no 'out of season' as Mustique is far enough south to avoid hurricanes and enjoys temperatures of around 24C (75F) to 27C (80F) all year round. It is also one of the safest places in the Caribbean. The only murder in Mustique’s recent history occurred 10 years ago when a French heiress was found stabbed to death in her villa - a crime that has never been solved.","St James's Palace: This is a clear breach of privacy and we are disappointed .

The discovery of shoes deliberately hidden in an ancient Egyptian temple has left archaeologists baffled, not least because they include design features thought to have been invented in Medieval Europe. Two pairs of tiny children's shoes were among the seven found concealed in a jar placed into a cavity between two mudbrick walls in a temple in Luxor, site of the ancient city of Thebes. Oddly, they were tied together using palm fibre string and placed within a single adult shoe. A third pair that had been worn by an adult was found alongside them. Karnak Temple in Luxor, Egypt: The discovery of ancient shoes with design features first thought to have been invented in Medieval Europe in one of the city's temples has left archaeologists baffled . But there is no clue as to why the . shoes, which would have been costly and unusual footwear for the era, . were never retrieved after they were left in the temple just over 2,000 . years ago when Egypt was ruled by a dynasty of Greek descent. Research has shown that at least one of them includes structural elements that historians had previously believed were not invented until the Medieval era, which began in Europe some 500 years later. At the time the shoes were concealed, most Egyptians would normally have worn sandals. The shoes were discovered by an Italian archaeological team in 2004, but a new study has now offered fresh insights into them. The modern city of Luxor in southern Egypt is the site of the Ancient Egyptian city of Thebes and is a popular destination for tourists. With the ruins of the temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor standing within its borders, it has been frequently described as the 'world's greatest open air museum'. Thebes was the great capital of Egypt during the New Kingdom, and the glorious city of the god Amon-Ra. In the Ancient Egyptian texts the city was regarded as 'Waset', meaning 'city of the sceptre'. and also as 'ta ipet', meaning 'the shrine'. In a later period, the Greeks called it Thebai and the Romans after them Thebae. The importance of the city started as early as the 11th Dynasty, when the town grew into a thriving city, renowned for its high social status and luxury, but also as a center for wisdom, art, religious and political supremacy.It grew to world-wide prominence during the time of . the New Kingdom, when the Pharoahs undertook military expeditions to Kush, in today's northern Sudan, and to the lands of Canaan, Phoenicia and Syria, bringing back great wealth to the city. The main god of the city was Amon, who was worshipped together with his wife, the Goddess Mut, and their son Khonsu, the God of the moon. With the rise of Thebes as the foremost city of Egypt, the local god Amon rose in importance as well and became linked to the sun god Ra, thus creating the new 'king of gods' Amon-Ra. His great temple, at Karnak just north of Thebes, was the most important temple of Egypt right until the end of antiquity. André Veldmeijer, assistant director of the Netherlands-Flemish Institute in Cairo and an expert in ancient Egyptian footwear, says it is likely the shoes were foreign made and 'relatively expensive'. 'The find is extraordinary as the shoes were in pristine condition and still supple upon discovery,' wrote Dr Veldmeijer in the most recent issue of the Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt. Unfortunately, he added, after they were unearthed the shoes became brittle and 'extremely fragile'. Since sandals were by far the most common footwear of the era in Egypt, the style and quality of the discovered shoes was such that 'everybody would look at you', Dr Veldmeijer told LiveScience. After being shown photographs of the seven shoes, Dr Veldmeijer made a number of discoveries about their design. Most surprising was that the single shoe discovered with the child's pairs inside was made with a feature that shoemakers know as a 'rand' - a structural device that was thought to have been first used in Medieval Europe. Folded leather strips that go between the soles and the upper parts of shoes, rands reinforce the stitching as 'the upper is very prone to tear apart at the stitch holes', Dr Veldmeijer told LiveScience. They would be useful in muddy conditions where shoes are under pressure, so to find the device in the dry climate of Egypt is surprising and indicates that the shoes were made somewhere abroad. Dr Veldmeijer also found that the shoes' owners would have tied them using what researchers call 'tailed toggles', which are leather strips that pass through at the top of the shoes. After they were knotted into place a long strip of leather would have hung down decoratively on either side. Dr Veldmaijer's analysis of the shoes also revealed insights into the health of their owners. He found a semi-circular protruding area in one that could have been caused by a bunion, while of the pair of adult shoes the left had more patches and evidence of repair than the right. 'The shoe was exposed to unequal pressure,' he told LiveScience, which showed that person who wore it 'walked with a limp, otherwise the wear would have been far more equal'. The wear and tear and subsequent repair showed that the people who wore them valued the shoes as 'highly prized commodities', Dr Veldmeijer said, deepening the mystery of why they were left in the temple. 'There's no reason to store them without having the intention of getting them back at some point,' he told LiveScience. He speculated that there could have been some kind of unrest that spurred the owners to leave their fancy shoes behind and flee hastily.","Shoes feature 'rand' device which helps bind upper to sole - and has only before been seen in footwear from Medieval Europe and later .

For sports fans, it could be a whole new way to watch - and really feel like you are part of the game. American researchers have revealed a 'ball-cam' mounted inside an American football. They have developed special software to process the footage, giving viewers a 'clean' video from the camera as the ball spins high above a football field. Scroll down for video . The view from the ball: The 'ballcam' has a high definition camera built in, while software creates a clear show even if the ball spins in the air . The specially adapted American football has a built in camera to record footage as it is thrown . Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Electro-Communications (UEC) in Tokyo say their camera could be used by TV firms and amateurs. Because a football can spin at 600 rpm, the raw video is an unwatchable blur. However, the researchers developed a computer algorithm that converts the raw video into a stable, wide-angle view. 'We're interested in how technology . can be used to enhance existing sports and how it might be used to . create new sports,' said Kodai Horita, one of the research team. 'In . some cases, athletic play may be combined with arts or entertainment; a . camera-embedded ball, for instance, might be used to capture the . expressions on the face of players as they play catch with it.' When the ball is thrown in a clean . spiral, the camera records a succession of frames as the ball rotates. When processing these frames, the algorithm uses the sky to determine . which frames were made when the camera was looking up and which were . made when it was looking down. The upward frames are discarded and the . remaining, overlapping frames are stitched together with special . software to create a large panorama. Similar stitching software is used . by NASA to combine images from Mars rovers into large panoramas and is . increasingly found in digital cameras. Kris Kitani, a post-doctoral fellow . in Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute, says a football league is . unlikely to approve camera-embedded footballs for regular play, but says . the BallCam might be useful for TV, movie productions or training . purposes. Multiple cameras might also be added to the football to improve the finished video. The researchers have shown that a camera embedded in the side of a rubber-sheathed plastic foam football can record video while the ball is in flight that could give spectators a unique, ball's-eye view of the playing field.","Researchers placed a camera inside an American football .

Women who eat plenty of leafy green vegetables could cut their risk of pre-menstrual syndrome by up to 40 per cent, according to researchers. The scientists were investigating the effects of non-heme iron, which is the type typically found in plant foods. They found over a 10 year period the women who consumed the most of this mineral in their diets had the lowest chance of developing PMS. Women who eat plenty of leafy green vegetables could cut their risk of pre-menstrual syndrome by up to 40 per cent . The team based at the University of Massachusetts and at Harvard, believe this is because the iron is involved in the . production of serotonin, a chemical that helps to regulate mood. PMS is the name given to the various symptoms that can occur in the two weeks before a woman's monthly period. These include fluid retention, breast tenderness, mood swings, feeling irritable and loss of interest in sex. The study, which is one of the first to evaluate whether mineral intake is associated with PMS development, looked at 3,000 women. All of the women who took part were free from PMS symptoms at the start of the study. They completed food frequency questionnaires throughout the 10 year trial at the end of which 1,057 women were diagnosed with PMS while 1,968 remained symptom free. The researchers, who published their findings in the American Journal of Epidemiology, found that the women who ate the most non-heme iron were much less likely to develop the condition. Dark, leafy greens . Dried fruit . Iron enriched cereals . Beans, lentils and chick peas . Artichokes . Broccoli and green beans . Senior author Dr Elizabeth Bertone-Johnson said: ‘Our findings need to be replicated in other studies. However, women at risk of PMS should make sure they are meeting the RDA for non-heme iron and zinc. ‘The level of iron intake at which we saw a lower risk of PMS, roughly greater than 20mg per day, is higher than the current recommended daily allowance for iron for premenopausal women, which is 18 mg per day. ‘However, as high iron intake may have adverse health consequences, women should avoid consuming more than the tolerable upper intake level of 45mg per day unless otherwise recommended by a physician.’ Excessive consumption of iron can, in some people, cause hemochromatosis which occurs when, over many years, iron builds up in organ tissue. In its most serious form the condition can cause diabetes, liver cancer, arthritis and heart failure.","Eating foods high in non-heme iron could cut PMS risk by 40 per cent, according to American researchers .

The number of older women having abortions is falling fast as more choose to be mothers . Abortions among older women are falling fast as growing numbers choose to become mothers. But figures published yesterday showed that, at the same time, abortion rates have been going up among younger women as more pursue higher education and careers. The findings from the Office for National Statistics suggest that women over 40 are increasingly unlikely to regard pregnancy as a mistake, while many are actively trying to start a family. The abandonment of abortion  by the great majority of women who conceive over the age of 40 was revealed by records of conceptions in 2011 in England and Wales. Conception rates among women over 40 went up 3.7 per cent in a year and have now more than doubled in two decades. In 1990, there were 12,032 women aged over 40 who became pregnant. By 2011 that had reached 28,747. But in 2011 just over a quarter of those women went for an abortion, while a decade ago the proportion was almost 35 per cent, and 20 years ago it was nearly 42 per cent. The ONS report said: ‘Reasons for an increased number of women aged 40 and over conceiving  include increased participation in higher education; delayed marriage and partnership formation; the desire to establish a career, get on the housing ladder and ensure financial stability before starting  a family.’ It also noted ‘a shift in aspirations of young women towards education’. At the peak age for motherhood, between 30 and 34, only 12.8 per cent of pregnant women had abortions in 2011. But abortion rates among under-30s have been rising as more pursue education and careers, and as women put off marrying or decide they cannot afford children. Among women aged between 20 and 24, 27.7 per cent of pregnancies ended in abortion. Nearly half of all pregnancies to girls under 18 ended in abortions, and six out of ten pregnancies to girls under 16 are terminated. Teen pregnancy rates fell sharply in the year after the Coalition  Government abandoned Labour’s flagship Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, a £250million campaign to spread contraception and sex education that was meant to halve the rate at which girls under 18 in England become pregnant. The number of teenage pregnancies in England and Wales fell by 10 per cent but the target set by Tony Blair to halve teen pregnancy rates is still far from being met . Conceptions among women  under 18 in . England and Wales fell by 10 per cent to just over 31,000, and . pregnancies among girls  under 16 also fell by 10 per cent to under . 6,000. Despite the fall, the target of  halving teen pregnancy rates that was set by Tony Blair in the early days of his premiership is still far from being met. Earlier this month the ONS said that unemployment and worklessness are the key reasons influencing teenage pregnancy, and played down lack of free contraception or sex education as a cause. Professor David Paton of Nottingham University Business School said yesterday: ‘Teenage pregnancy rates have only been going down since 2008, by which time the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy had already spent a lot of money. ‘The rate has still been going down since the TPA ended in 2010. ‘It confirms what we already know from the scientific literature – reducing teen pregnancy is not a matter of more contraception and sex education.’ He added: ‘One factor is that more girls want to stay on at school.’","Fewer older women have abortions as more choose to become mothers .

Nasa has revealed a stunning video showing Mecury rotating, revealing the crater filled surface of the planet in unprecedented quality. The false color view of Mercury was produced by putting together thousands of of images obtained by NASA's Mercury, Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (Known as Messenger) spacecraft, which is in orbit around the innermost planet. The planet, which in reality is brown, has been enhanced by engineers to reveal the huge variation in the planet's surface, revealing both fresh and old craters. Watch the amazing video below . The amazing animation shows the surface of Mercury in unprecedented detail, with fresh craters next to massive ancient impact craters . Messenger is the first spacecraft . ever to orbit the planet Mercury. The spacecraft's seven scientific . instruments and radio science investigation are unraveling the history . and evolution of the planet closest to the Sun. During its one-year . primary mission, Messenger acquired 88,746 images. It is now in an extended mission, during which plans . call for the acquisition of more than 80,000 additional images. 'Color variations on Mercury's surface are subtle, and to the human eye Mercury would appear to be varying shades of dark brown,' Nasa said. Engineers used eight color filters on the spacecraft's camera to accentuate real color variations that are linked to the composition and texture of materials on the surface. Areas with a redder color appear red, and areas with a grayer color appear blue. 'This view of the surface captures both compositional differences and differences in how long materials have been exposed at Mercury's surface,' the space agency said. Young crater rays, arrayed radially around fresh impact craters, appear light blue or white. Medium- and dark-blue areas are a geologic unit of Mercury's crust known as the 'low-reflectance material', thought to be rich in a dark, opaque mineral. Tan areas are plains formed by eruption of highly fluid lavas. The large circular area in the northern hemisphere is the Caloris impact basin, whose interior is filled with smooth, somewhat younger volcanic plains. The images reveal giant craters on the surface of Mercury seen in unprecedented detail. This basin's outer rim is about 306 km in diameter and the inner (peak) ring is about 140 km in diameter . The images were created using a mosaic of pictures from Nasa's messenger spacecraft, which were then combined to create a video 'flyby' of the planet . Small orangish spots are materials deposited by explosive volcanic eruptions. The project is part of a global color map that covers more than 99% of Mercury's surface with an average resolution of about 1 kilometer per pixel. The view here is what an observer would see from high above the equator. These color images of Mercury's surface were obtained when the spacecraft was viewing Mercury with the Sun overhead, so shadows cast by topographic features are barely visible. Other image mosaics of Mercury were taken with the Sun low to the horizon, creating shading to accentuate topography. Unlike Nasa's Mars rover Curiosity, which will be sampling rocks and soils to look for organic materials directly, the MESSENGER probe bounces laser beams, counts particles, measures gamma rays and collects other data remotely from orbit.","Mosaics were created with thousands of images taken by orbiting Nasa spacecraft .

The reformulated biscuits were quietly introduced into supermarkets in December, with manufacturers only officially launching them last week. Scroll down for video . Customers preferred the taste of biscuits made with the old recipe (left) to the  more chocolatey snack (right) Taste testers say the new version is . less crunchy, and the topping is more even - even though there is . slightly more chocolate than the old one. And in a blind trial, two thirds of those tasting the new recipe said they preferred the original. The snack company said it ‘tweaked’ the ingredients of the brand after receiving feedback from customers. Television ads launched last week to . publicise the changes use the slogans ‘wholemeal at their heart’ and . ‘now with more chocolate’. United Biscuits, which owns McVitie’s, . said the new biscuit had around three per cent more chocolate, and the . coating was more even. However, consumer group Which? found that just one per cent more was added. Each biscuit contains 86 calories, . compared to 85, and slightly more sugar, fat and saturated fat, although . experts said the difference was ‘negligible’. And when 30 shoppers tried both versions, 19 preferred the old recipe. McVitie's introduced the new more chocolatey recipe to supermarket shelves back in December last year . A spokesman for Which? said: ‘Our . 30-strong blind taste test panel preferred the old biscuit, with many . mentioning its crunchier texture.’ McVitie’s started making chocolate . digestives in 1925 at its factory in Harlesden, North London – and last . year sold 81 million packs in the UK. A spokesman for the firm said: ‘McVitie’s Chocolate Digestives are the Nation’s favourite biscuit. ‘The British public love our biscuits . so we have not reformulated the biscuit itself in any way or changed the . “eat” of the product. ‘We have just added on more chocolate, hence the “now with more chocolate” statement on pack to communicate this. ‘The feedback we’ve had is that people . like it.’ Last year, McVitie’s faced a consumer backlash after it . slashed the amount of saturated fat in digestive biscuits by 80 per . cent. Critics said the change ruined the taste, made them more oily and left them too brittle to dunk in a cup of tea. Digestives have been enjoyed by Britons for more than a century, with Huntley & Palmers first advertising them in 1876. The name comes from the digestive properties they were thought to have because of the amount of baking soda in the recipe. In 1892, Edinburgh bakers McVitie . & Price made their version of the biscuit to a recipe created by . young new employee Alexander Grant. It was their first major biscuit and demand was strong, prompting the building of two new factories. In 1925, the company started making the chocolate version, which American writer Bill Bryson called ‘a British masterpiece’.

It's the latest lurid claim to hit . the case, which has seen numerous sensational allegations in the wake of . Steenkamp's death. However, it remains unconfirmed in South Africa. Pistorius, who had both of his legs amputated below the knee when he was just 11 months old, competed on a set of prosthetic blades, earning him the nickname 'blade runner.' He has competed as a sprinter in each of the Paralympic Summer Games since 2004 until running alongside able-bodied athletes in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. But his days as a runner will be numbered if he's found guilty of Steenkamp's murder. His family said on Tuesday that the runner held a private memorial service for Steenkamp at his Uncle Arnold's home in Pretoria, where he has been staying since he was freed on bail. In mourning: Friends and family arrived to pay their respects at Arnold Pistorius house in Pretoria, South Africa, where Oscar has been since he was released on bail, as a memorial service was held for Reeva Steenkamp . Arrivals: The South African Paralympic athlete, 26, who denies murdering Reeva Steenkamp, 29, has been free on bail since last Friday. Friends and relatives were pictured arriving at his uncle's home in Pretoria last night . The runner's family has asked for privacy but confirmation of the memorial service came after a leak in the media, Sky News reported today. A . statement by Pistorius' representatives said: 'This statement is . released in response to a leak to the media regarding a planned private . memorial service for Reeva Steenkamp. 'Oscar Pistorius, will hold a private memorial service for Reeva Steenkamp at the house of his uncle, Arnold Pistorius, tonight. Oscar Pistorius claims he shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead by accident believing her to be an intruder at his home . 'Oscar . specifically requested the memorial service as he continues to grieve . and remains in deep mourning for the loss of his partner Reeva.

Pistorius family would like to make a personal request to the media, to . please respect their privacy at their home in Pretoria tonight.' Also on Tuesday, it was revealed that Desmond Nair, chief magistrate of the Pretoria Magistrate's Court who presided over the bail hearing, is in mourning after it is believed one of his relatives killed herself and her children. The bodies of a woman and her two . sons were found on Sunday evening at their Johannesburg home by her . ex-husband, police warrant officer Balan Muthan said. Authorities suspect the woman administered a substance that killed her children, and took her own life by ingesting it as well. 'I can confirm the deceased is my first cousin,' Nair said. The . woman's brother, Vishal Maharaj, identified her as Anusha Maharaj. Police said Maharaj was her family name before she married. South . African media identified her as Anusha Mooljee. Muthan . said police suspect 'she took her own life by ingesting a substance . that killed her,' and that she 'most probably' gave the same substance . to her children. Autopsies were conducted on Monday and . toxicologists were analyzing the substance believed to have killed the . three family members. Suicide . notes were found and a murder investigation was underway, Muthan said. He said copies of the notes were admitted as evidence in the probe and . declined to comment on the contents. Eyewitness . News, a South African media outlet, said the boys who died were 12 and . 17 years old and cited neighbor Claire Osment as saying she rushed . outside after hearing screams coming from the townhouse where they . lived.

The dad just said, ""She has killed my boys."" He was just crying,' Eyewitness News quoted her as saying. 'He couldn't believe it, he couldn't believe that his sons are gone.' Nair, 44, has presided over a number . of high-profile cases, including the 2008 conviction on fraud charges of . Sydney Maree, a South African who took American citizenship and became a . track star in the United States. He . also presided over a 2011 plea agreement in which rugby player Bees .

Charged: Carl Pistorius, with sister Aimee, in court to see their brother Oscar granted bail after being charged with murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . The murder-suicide would be the the latest in a series of twists that have come along with the Pistorius trial. Last . week, the chief investigator in the case against Pistorius, Hilton . Botha, was removed from the inquiry after it was revealed that attempted . murder charges against him had been reinstated in early February. The charges relate to a 2011 incident in which Botha and two other police officers allegedly fired on a minibus. In . another surprise, a lawyer for the Pistorius family said Sunday that . Oscar's brother, Carl, faces a charge of unlawful, negligent killing for . a 2008 road death.

With news of Steve Martin becoming a father at 67 and Hugh Grant at 52, it seems that you're never too old to have children. But the ideal age to start to procreate, according to a recent study of British mothers and fathers, is just 26-years-old. A third of parents claim that having . children at a younger age meant they could have a bigger family, while a . fifth felt they will have more in common with their children. Are they ready? Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Zac Efron are both 26, the perfect age for having a first child . A quarter of those questioned weren’t sure how long it would take to conceive, and so wanted to start early. Owning a house and getting married were the two key milestones most parents wanted to have reached before having children. Despite these milestones, six in 10 parents were happy to be earning a collective wage of just £25,000 a year before settling down to have a family. Collective wage: Six in 10 parents were happy to be earning a collective wage of just £25,000 a year before settling down to have a family, Blake Lively and Ed Westwick are both 26 but earn a lot more than that . Claire Halsey, Clinical Psychologist and contributor to the Seven Seas Pregnancy whitepaper, who carried out the research, said: 'The results of this survey are quite surprising, as we would have expected parents to think the perfect age to start a family to be late twenties to early thirties, as opposed to mid-twenties. 'Contrary to popular belief younger women are planning a family after just a few years of working rather than waiting to establish a career, going travelling or spending time on hobbies. 'Perhaps there is a realisation that as the recession affects work prospects, planning for a family can come first and career later.' Perfect age: Like Hilary Duff, most Brits think that 26 is the perfect age to have a child. Reasons include worrying that they won't be able to conceive when older . The report also questioned 2000 childless adults about their plans to have a family. While one in 20 claimed they never wanted to have children, the average age across the rest of the respondents was 28. So despite two thirds of people without children wanting to have achieved something in life before starting a family, most reckon they will have done this before hitting 30. As well as wanting to have a house and marriage sorted, half of those polled wanted to earn a decent amount of money, while 47 per cent want job security. Four in 10 people would like to have savings in the bank before settling down with kids and 26 per cent wanted to have enjoyed lots of holidays. Older fathers: The average age for wanting children across childless respondents was 28, much younger than celebrity fathers Steve Martin who had a baby at 67 and Hugh Grant, 52 . Childless couples also wanted to make a number of preparations before starting a family, but financial stability outweighs pre-conceptual health planning  – six in 10 wanted to save money for months in advance, while only a fifth would take folic acid, vitamins and supplements. Despite government recommendations, 85 per cent of mothers and pregnant women didn’t take a conception supplement containing folic acid, omega-3 and vitamin D during their pregnancy. Adopting a healthier attitude to life was a big concern – just under half of those polled on pregnancy wanted to eat healthier food, a quarter would take up more exercise and the same percentage would like to lose weight. Of those mothers who have already had children, a fifth admitted they were initially worried that they weren’t healthy enough to start a family. And of the six in 10 mums who planned their conception, one in 10 stopped smoking, and 23 per cent made healthier food choices and cut down on alcohol.","Both mothers and fathers have voted mid-twenties as time when young couples should start a family .

A major privacy row has broken out over technology that can 'listen in' to phone calls and work out what mood the participants are in. Telefónica, owner of the O2 network in Britain, says it is developing the technology so customers can 'learn about themselves'. However, experts have warned it could be used to sell advertising more effectively - and say it is a 'huge risk' to consumers. How are you feeling? Telefonica has developed software that can listen in on calls and work out what mood speakers are in . This week Telefónica boasted the technology is '80% accurate' as it revealed the system in a secret meeting at the Mobile World Congress exhibition in Barcelona. A team of engineers and psychologists in Telefónica's Barcelona research facility has built a working version, although so far they have only tested it on internal volunteers. The firm claims it can only analyse a tone of voice, and not work out what is being said. 'This is a . proof of concept that our innovation lab has been working on to empower . people with their own data to see what it says about them,' a spokesman said. 'There are no . plans to commercialise this and absolutely no intention of offering this . information to advertisers.' However, experts say the technology is likely to be seen as extremely lucrative to advertisers - and warned it could be a huge risk to consumer's privacy. Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'It might sound futuristic but voice analysis, like facial recognition technology, poses a huge risk to people’s privacy because it’s easy to use without people knowing. 'If it is ever turned on, this must be an opt-in system, with people fully aware of who will be able to see these psychological profiles and what purpose they are being drawn up for. 'We’re seeing an arms race between all kinds of companies to gather as much data on their customers – indeed anyone they can – as fast as possible and ultimately the real motivation is likely to be corporate profits, not consumer benefit. Mobile giant Telefonica, which owns O2 in the UK, has been working with psychologists to develop the controversial software . 'The question is whether consumers are willing to tolerate this kind of intrusive monitoring for slightly better targeted advertisements or spurious service changes. 'I expect most people will be strongly against the privacy of their calls being intruded upon in this way.' Eden Zoller, a consumer analyst at Ovum, said the privacy concerns may make it impossible for the system to ever be launched. ‘Consumers are increasingly concerned . about how their personal data is exploited, which in turn is reflected . by mounting regulatory scrutiny of this issue,' she said. ‘Ovum believes that a commercial launch for the project is likely to be challenging. 'Telefonica’s linguistic analysis engine provides a deep level of granularity, even without listening to actual conversations, and we think that consumers will be very uncomfortable and resistant to the idea.' She believes the system could be used in a similar way to Facebook's controversial Graph Search, which 'mines' a user's profile for information. 'While Google has the search graph and Facebook has the social graph, Telefonica Digital says that it has the voice graph,' she said. 'This level of insight would clearly be of interest to advertisers and organizations in sectors such as tourism.'","Telefonica - owner of O2 - revealed technology that will 'listen in' on calls .

"By . Chris Hastings . PUBLISHED: . 17:45 EST, 22 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:25 EST, 22 December 2012 . With his intensely personal portraits, Lucian Freud often defied convention. And now the late artist’s estate has found an equally unorthodox way to settle his £10 million . inheritance tax bill – by trading in parts of his art collection. In April, The Mail on Sunday revealed that Freud left £96 million in his will, the largest sum ever by a British artist. But rather than hand a large slice of it to the taxman, executors of the estate have offered to give a selection of artworks to museums in lieu  of payment. Executors are understood to have offered some of Lucien Freud (left) 's favourite works including Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot's painting L'Italienne, Ou La Femme A La Manche Jaune to settle his tax bill . Works offered are understood to include examples by French sculptor Edgar Degas, and French artist Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot’s painting L’Italienne, Ou La Femme  A La Manche Jaune. Freud, whose sitters included the Queen, Kate Moss and a naked Jobcentre supervisor nicknamed ‘Big Sue’, died in  July last year. Last month, the Government’s Acceptance in Lieu panel (AIL), which works in conditions of utter secrecy, is said to have approved the application to use artworks to settle the tax bill, deciding the items offered were of enough significance. Its decision will have to be ratified by Ministers, who will then decide which museums and galleries receive the items. One source in the art world said: ‘It was not a long list of items but it included the Corot painting and the sculptures. There may have been one or two other things. ‘The amount to be covered is just under £10 million.’ A spokesman for the Arts Council, which runs the AIL panel, last night declined to confirm or deny whether Freud’s estate had even made an approach to the panel. The National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery both declined to comment. The Tate Gallery said: ‘We can’t comment on works of art that are not part of the Tate collection.’ Another source last night said that it was almost certain that the Corot painting would end up  in the National Gallery. In a rare interview in 2002, Freud, who fathered at least 14 children, named Corot as one of the all-time greats of the art world alongside Constable, Rembrandt and Gericault. His collection contains several works by his friend, the German-born artist Frank Auerbach. The Corot painting offered to the nation was once owned by Hollywood star Edward G. Robinson, best known for his gangster roles in films such as Key Largo and Double Indemnity. Freud’s will revealed that he left David Dawson, his assistant of more than 20 years, £2.5 million as well as his West London home. Dawson was unavailable for comment. Lawyer Diana Rawstron, an executor of the estate, who is believed to have handled negotiations with the panel, was also unavailable.","Executors offer works by Edgar Egas abd Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot .

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 20:24 EST, 27 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:38 EST, 28 February 2013 . Defiant: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he will take on Strasbourg judges on prisoner IVF ban . Chris Grayling last night pledged to face down Strasbourg human rights judges and stop prisoners getting IVF at taxpayers’ expense. In a highly combative move, the Justice Secretary made clear he wants a ban on convicts accessing costly fertility treatment from behind bars. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled blocking prisoners’ access to treatment may breach their right to a ‘private and family life’. Since a 2007 case involving a British killer, 13 inmates have demanded the right to father children, citing the decision. In 2011, one application was approved by then Prisons  Minister Crispin Blunt. But today Mr Grayling, a critic of human rights rulings, told the Daily Mail: ‘I am extremely concerned about prisoners having access to  artificial insemination, which is why I am reviewing the policy with a view to banning it. ‘There can be no clearer example of why we need changes to the human rights framework.’ In December, the Mail revealed five life prisoners, four murderers and a drug dealer, had made applications to the Ministry of Justice for fertility treatment. The decision on what happens ultimately rests with the Justice Secretary. Two of the five have already been refused, while the remainder are still in the system. Any ban would inevitably end up back in the courts and test ministers’ resolve to stand up to Strasbourg. It might also mean compensation for inmates who are refused IVF under the ban. But critics say ministers could simply refuse to pay out and let the Council of Europe – the court’s governing body – decide what action to take. The 2007 ruling in the case of convicted killer Kirk Dickson led to rule changes making it easier for IVF to be approved. Dickson and a friend kicked to death George Askins, 41, in 1995 for a few cigarettes. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled blocking prisoner's access to IVF may breach their rights . He was handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 15 years, but met wife Lorraine in a prison penpal scheme. She was also a convict,  sentenced to 12 months in 1999 for a £20,000 benefit fraud. They married while he was behind bars, and officials refused to authorise her access to a sperm donation from him for IVF treatment. In 2001 then Home Secretary David Blunkett rejected their application on the grounds any child would be without a father for much of its childhood. He also said there was a need to maintain public confidence in prison as a punishment. Using legal aid, Dickson appealed – losing in every court in England. But Strasbourg set aside ministers’ arguments. Grayling said he is 'extremely concerned' about inmates having access to artificial insemination . The court said his rights had been breached under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to a private and family life, and awarded £18,000 damages. Perversely, the decision makes it more likely IVF  treatment will be given to inmates who commit the most heinous crimes, as they spend longer locked up. Mr Grayling has said he wants to ‘curtail’ the powers of the Strasbourg court and return it to the vision of its founders, who were reacting to the  horrors of Nazism. He has also criticised the court’s decision to demand an end to the ban on prisoners having the vote. Last year he said: ‘I don’t believe the originators of the Convention on Human Rights ever imagined it being used for things like this.’","Chris Grayling he was 'extremely concerned' at inmates being given IVF .

"Judge James Dabney is 'concerned' that New York lawyer Mark Heller isn't prepared to represent her . Lindsay - who was present at pre-trial - either has to get another lawyer or she has to come into court and waive her right to a competent California lawyer . He vehemently blocks Heller's attempt to put back trial from March 18 to April 1 . 'In the interest of justice, my client needs that time,' Heller maintained . By . Amelia Proud . PUBLISHED: . 13:00 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:09 EST, 1 March 2013 . 'Give her leeway to show that she's worth of compassion,' Mark Heller pleaded with Judge James Dabney this morning in a bid to get Lindsay Lohan's latest criminal case thrown out. The New York based lawyer even played the victim card, telling Judge James Dabney that 'there seems to be some doubt as to whether Lohan is entitled to some mercy because of her history with this department.' But the judge wasn't buying it, and he steadfastly refused to allow Heller to persuade him to move the trial date from March 18 to April 1. Unsuitable? Judge Dabney told Lindsay Lohan's lawyer that he was not versed sufficiently in California law to represent her properly at trial as he threw his attempts to have lying to police claims thrown out during this morning's pre-trial hearing . Noting that it was also April Fools' Day, Dabney pointed out that April 1st is a court holiday and said he saw no merit in postponing the reckoning. He also questioned Heller's suitability to represent Lohan, 26, as it seemed to the judge as though the lawyer - who admitted he'd practised in New York for 44 years - wasn't completely versed in California law. Heller began by questioning 'particulars', in short - he wanted to know where certain statements attributed by Lohan were made after the the June crash relating to the lying allegations. Did Lohan - who is accused of lying to cover up the fact that she was driving recklessly - make her statement at the scene, or at hospital or to police at a later date? Slammed: Heller obviously feels strongly about helping Lindsay but his preparation and suitability was questioned by the judge in court on Friday . The judge told Heller that he saw no need to discuss these details until trial, and added emphatically that this was all in accordance with California law. He added that Heller had not prepared adequately given his lack of competence in California law, which meant prosecutor Terry White's trial date remained in place. He told Heller his concerns about police not reading Lindsay her Miranda rights were of no concern, either, as Lindsay's fourth amendment rights had not been violated. Dabney also emphasized to Heller that he needs to take local guidance before trial and that Lindsay will suffer if she doesn't have a legal team who fully understand California law. Her father Michael was, as always, quick to comment on the matter to TMZ, he said: 'This guy is a loser and will drag her down. 'I already started to pray to God that Lindsay fires him before it's too late,' he added before explaining he has another lawyer lined up. Back at court: Lindsay Lohan appears at a hearing with her attorney Mark Heller on January 30, 2013 . Lohan was on probation at the time of the accident and she . faces jail time if a judge determines she violated her sentence in a 2011 theft . case. It has been reported that prosecutors offered her a 'no jail' deal if she agreed to return to rehab, but she rejected it. According to TMZ, . the Mean Girls star does not believe she has a substance abuse problem . that warrants the condition and is risking instead to take the case to . trial. The website reports that Heller had a telephone conference with prosecutors on Wednesday to discuss the terms of the bargain. Prosecutors were apparently asking for 'a significant amount of time in a residential rehab facility'. Earlier reports suggested the plea bargain stipulates she must enroll in rehab for at least 60 days, attend AA meetings and undertake community service. Heller reportedly did not accept the offer, although the insider says 'negotiations are ongoing'. Lohan is said to be against the idea of going back to rehab entirely, looking at the condition as 'punishment for something I didn't do'. Facing the music: Heller's pleas for 'compassion' and 'mercy' fell on deaf ears and Lindsay will face trial on March 18 . Details of the apparent deal surfaced after the New York-based attorney sent an emotional letter pleading with prosecutors to help the 'deeply broken' actress. Heller reveals that Lindsay is undergoing extensive psychiatric therapy and is struggling to overcome a history of family issues, and urges Santa Monica and Los Angeles City Attorneys Terry White and Spencer Hart to join forces with him to become the team that 'fix' the actress. Sent on February 4 and obtained by TMZ, the letter was also sent to the judge presiding over the case. Heller, who came onto the case after Lohan fired her long-term attorney, Shawn Holley, earlier this year, wrote the prosecutors need to understand that his client's problems are even deeper than what is publicly known. On her way: Lindsay Lohan and her mother Dina head to the car crash case pre-trial hearing on January 30 . 'I have known Lindsay for many years and have witnessed the dynamics of her family and her experiences that are not known to general public, and which have deeply impacted her and resulted in certain events in her life that has bought her before the Court and derivatively to your attention and professional assessment,' he is quoted. 'Yet, as I noted at our meeting these prior events and their portrayal in the media, regrettably always results in distortion, creating a very negative public persona without consideration of what happened in Lindsay's life that bought her to that place and without considering the pain, torment and confusion which Lindsay has experienced and been affected with.' The lawyer promises, alongside Lindsay's psychotherapist, to reveal just how bad things have become for the Parent Trap actress as he says that without knowing, the prosecutors are 'handicapped because he could you propose to fix something without known just how broken it was'. 'The only way we as a ""team"" are going to formulate a solution is for Lindsay, her Psychotherapist and I provide a true window revealing the real problems we must solve,' the letter reportedly continues. Family drama: Lohan's lawyer has apparently pleaded with prosecutors to join him in helping to 'fix' the actress in light of her personal issues, stemming from her relationships with father Michael Lohan, left, and Dina Lohan, right . Heller appeals to the prosecutors to consider alternatives to Lohan's previous sentences - including a lengthy probation in 2011 for stealing a necklace, which is now in jeopardy in light of the new criminal charges. 'Which is why I appeal to your good conscious to join me in not rubber stamping this case but rather to be patient and understanding and open to productive alternatives as we, as a team, help fix Lindsay Lohan,' the letter continues. The case is not Lohan's only legal worry. The actress earlier this week was fined $1000 for failing to make herself available in a civil case deposition, RadarOnline reported. Lohan was repetitively requested to attend a deposition in the civil case bought by photographer Grigor Baylan, who filed the civil lawsuit claiming he was injured when a car that the actress was riding in hit him in 2010. The actress claimed to be out of state but was in California for her criminal cases pre-trial, according to the website. She could face a reported 245 days in jail if she is found guilty in the criminal case. A spokesman for Lohan has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment.","Judge James Dabney is 'concerned' that New York lawyer Mark Heller isn't prepared to represent her .

As Morecambe and Wise, they were the nation’s best-loved comedy act, their Christmas extravaganzas regularly pulling in audiences of more than 20 million. But BBC chiefs initially believed Eric Morecambe would have a much better chance of TV stardom if he dumped Ernie Wise and went solo. The damning appraisal, delivered just two years before the duo finally found fame on commercial television, was discovered in the BBC’s own archives. Unwise words: Initial reviews said Eric Morecambe (top) should dump partner Ernie Wise . In a letter to a scriptwriter dated June 5, 1959, John Ammonds, one of the Corporation’s comedy producers who had previously worked with the stars on radio, ruled out a TV series.He argued they were ‘stuck in a rut and too reliant on outdated gags’. He wrote: ‘After seeing Morecambe and Wise the other week in their show [in] Blackpool, I am not at all sure as to their strength on a TV programme. ‘They are still working to old gags and in my opinion, frequently working the wrong type of material. They are quite a disappointment to me because when I first worked with them in this region on sound, I thought they had a great future. ‘It is even more depressing than it seems because they are quite happy to jog along as they are doing at the moment. The damning appraisal was delivered two years before before the duo found fame on commercial television . ‘I always thought Eric Morecambe was a funny man and still think that he could be very successful on vision but only if he could be detached from Ernie, who I think is a big weakness. I really cannot see them making the grade in a TV series.’ Morecambe and Wise, who began performing together in 1941, enjoyed success on stage and radio, but initially struggled to make an impression on television. A 1954 BBC comedy show called Running Wild was panned by critics and led one reviewer to define a television set as ‘the box they buried Morecambe and Wise in’. Other letters in the archives show that the duo feared that the failure of Running Wild would have a detrimental impact on their careers as live performers. They tried to quit the show before it had finished its run. In a letter dated June 17, 1954, the pair’s agent, Frank Pope, told Ronald Waldman, the head of light entertainment: ‘I called my clients into my office to see me this morning in view of the television broadcast they did last night and to say in my personal opinion this was the worst performance I have ever witnessed my clients giving, not because of their inability but plainly because the material etc supplied for them to appear in was most unsuitable and inadequate. ‘On behalf of my clients, I must refuse them being allowed to appear for the last of the six television broadcasts in their contract. You will appreciate my clients’ main livelihood depends upon theatrical engagements and they cannot possibly afford to jeopardise any further their reputation in this market.’ In a memo dated April 23, 1954, Waldman said the show flopped because it was reliant ‘on second-rate artists and fourth-rate writers’. Morecambe and Wise eventually found fame on television in the hit 1961 show Two Of A Kind, which was made by commercial broadcaster ATV.

The pair eventually found fame on television in the hit 1961 show Two Of A Kind . In 1968, they transferred to the BBC and began what was to be the most successful part of their entertainment career. Ironically, given his earlier dismissal of the duo, Ammonds played a key role in the success of the show and is even credited with devising the famous dance routine that brought each episode to an end. The pair’s subsequent partnership with comedy writer Eddie Braben produced some of the most memorable moments in television. He teamed the comics with Glenda Jackson, who starred as Cleopatra in ‘a play wot Ernie wrote’; Shirley Bassey, who tried to perform Smoke Gets In Your Eyes in an evening dress and a pair of Eric’s boots; and Andre Previn, who was given an unorthodox master class by Eric. The Morecambe And Wise Christmas Show became the TV highlight of the year and the 1977 edition, which featured a dancing Angela Rippon and some of the BBC’s best-known personalities in a tribute to the musical South Pacific attracted 28 million viewers.","Producer argued they were 'stuck in a rut and too reliant on outdated gags'

Hard-up: John Cleese (with fourth wife Jennifer Wade) is going to great lengths to sell his old Bentley Eight . As Basil Fawlty, the irate owner of Britain’s most notorious hotel, he was not known for his love of cars and famously gave one ‘a damn good thrashing’ with a tree branch. But funnyman John Cleese clearly has a soft spot for his old Bentley Eight – and is going to elaborate lengths to sell it. He has agreed to have lunch with whoever buys it and give an handwritten story of some of the car’s most famous passengers, including Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline, his co-stars from the film A Fish Called Wanda. He is also offering a signed photograph of the classic scene of him ‘thrashing’ the red Austin 1300 in Fawlty Towers. Cleese, 73, has put his 1987 Bentley, which is currently in storage in Kent, up for auction on the website of the Original Memorabilia Company with a starting price of £2,500. In a description he writes: ‘Twenty-five years on it is a little faded, and needs some TLC to restore its natural beauty including some attention to the battle scars from a quarrel with a gate post the last time I drove it, but it remains a fabulous car to drive and is the most beautiful car I have ever owned.’ The money will come in handy for the four-times married Monty Python veteran. In his acrimonious 2009 divorce settlement with his third wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger, Cleese was ordered to pay £12.5 million in finance and assets, including £612,000 a year until 2016. It prompted him to embark on his ‘Alimony Tour’ to meet the costs. His divorce from second wife Barbara Trentham cost him £2.5 million in 1988. The terms of his divorce from first wife Connie Booth, who co-wrote and starred with him in Fawlty Towers have never been made public. Earlier this year he married fourth wife, Jennifer Wade. On the website, Cleese says that the car, which has just over 73,500 miles on the clock, is in ‘excellent condition mechanically’ and has ‘just sailed through its MOT’. Not Fawlty: The 1987 Bentley Eight which John Cleese says is the 'most beautiful car'. He has agreed to have lunch with whoever buys it and a signed photograph of a Fawlty Towers scene . He also posted a tweet yesterday which said: ‘My dear old Bentley of 25 years needs a new home and I will be delighted to take its new owner to lunch.’ He is using the same site to sell copies of a 1970 photograph which shows all six Monty Python stars doing trademark silly walks.

A science teacher who was fired for keeping a Bible . on his desk has is taking his battle to the Supreme Court today to prove that his dismissal is against the constitution.

Investigators say he preached . Christian beliefs in class when . discussing topics such as evolution and homosexuality and kept a Bible . on his desk even after the school district told him not to. Making his case: John Freshwater addresses a crowd on Mount Vernon's public square in Mount Vernon, Ohio. The public school science teacher who kept a bible on his desk and was accused of preaching religious beliefs in class. Freshwater also was accused of using a piece of science equipment to burn students' arms with the image of a cross. Parents complained and filed lawsuits. Two lower courts previously upheld Freshwater's dismissal, but the . state Supreme Court has now agreed to hear a portion of his claims over his . firing. The hearing was to be held on Wednesday. Freshwater can argue it is unconstitutional to fire . someone without clear guidance on what teaching materials or methods are . acceptable. Freshwater also can argue it is unconstitutional to fire . someone over the mere presence of a religious text such as the Bible in a . classroom. As an eighth-grade science teacher, Freshwater tried to encourage his . students to examine facts, theories and hypotheses and then question . them and differentiate between them, his attorney said in a court . filing last year. A voluntary discussion of creationism or 'intelligent design' as part . of the mandatory discussion of evolution is unquestionably part of a . secular education program, attorney Kelly Hamilton wrote. 'Freshwater did not engage in religious proselytization - he . discussed a scientific theory that happens to be consistent with the . teachings of multiple major world religions,' Hamilton wrote. The board's actions, he concluded, were nothing less 'than the censorship of ideas'. Freshwater is getting legal backing from the Charlottesville, Virginia-based Rutherford Institute, a civil liberties group. A town divided: The main street in Mount Vernon, Ohio where science teacher John Freshwater taught pupils science before his dismissal in 2011 .

A group of young German inventors are poised to carry flight tests of the world's first winged jetpack that can take off from the ground. Fritz Unger and his friends from Hanover have spent more than five years so far developing their one-man, jet-propelled wing. Once completed, the backpack-mounted aircraft, dubbed Skyflash, will be the smallest twin-engined aeroplane ever built and could herald a new era of personal air travel. Scroll down for video . Flying through the air... This montage picture shows how the Skyflash might look if the young German team behind it ever get it off the ground . The team behind it say that it should be able to hit top speeds of more than 200mph, with a flight ceiling of 26,000ft, easily steered by the movement of the pilot's body. And unlike the jet packs made famous by Jetman Yves Rossy, the Skyflash will be able to take off from the ground instead of being dropped from an aircraft. Although Mr Unger has been a pilot since the age of 14, he has always dreamed of flying without the encumbrance of a plane or glider, Gizmag reports. The Skyflash's design is said to be based on the wings of the condor, large broad-winged soaring birds which are able to alter their wing structure to exploit variable wind conditions in their mountainous habitat. Accordingly, the wings on the Skyflash are composed of three units that separate for more surface area to provide lift on take off then contract in flight for greater speed and stability. Similar technology is already used on a much larger scale in modern jet airliners. Poised: The wings on the Skyflash are composed of three units that separate for more surface area to provide lift on take off then contract in flight for greater speed and stability . Skyflash is powered by dual microturbine diesel jet engines built into the so-called 'WingBody' backpack section, which also holds the flight computer and control electronics. Before take-off the pilot puts on the WingBody like a backpack and fastens it to himself, before presumably enlisting a helper to attach the wings, which also contain the fuel tanks, using a quick release system. Across his front sits the landing gear, which has four 10in off-road tires the Skyflash team claim is 'able to cope with potholed grass runways'. Schematic: The team behind Skyflash say that it should be able to hit top speeds of more than 200mph, with a flight ceiling of 26,000ft, easily steered by the movement of the pilot's body . With one eye on the cost, the Skyflash team have built their revolutionary aircraft from aviation plywood, which has also enabled them to keep its empty weight down to 55lbs. Controlling the Skyflash is achieved via an 8in graphical user interface attached to the flight computer and a throttle in the pilot's right hand that looks like those which come with cheap remote control cars. Once in the air, the pilot steers the Skyflash by shifting his body weight. The angle of climb is controlled by bending your knees to dip your boots into the exhaust - similar to the control vanes on a V2 rocket.

Light: With one eye on the cost, the Skyflash team have built their revolutionary aircraft from aviation plywood, which has also enabled them to keep its empty weight down to 55lbs . The Skyflash team say on the project's website: 'Our dream is a totally unlimited flying between the clouds. Glide with your own body... Let yourself merge with the wings. 'Two microjets let you speed through the sky with more than 200 miles per hour. 'The Skyflash shall be easily transported to your local airstrip and put together there with just a few strokes of work. 'You take off lying comfortably on your 10in off-road landing gear. After just a few moments you get airborne, harvesting the power of the two turbojet engines working in your back. 'Now everything responds to the actions of your body. A slight motion of your finger accelerates. Outstretching your arm starts a turn. Finally bend your knees and accelerate skywards.' They add: 'Landing works the same way you took off. But until that moment has come, you share boundless freedom with nothing but the clouds and the limitless sky. 'In case of an emergency you land safely using your total recovery parachute system.

A British kitchen fitter will finally stand trial next week accused of pushing a holidaymaker to his death over the side of a pleasure boat 17 years ago. Garry Walton, 21, drowned after falling from a booze cruise in Tenerife in November 1996. Nearly two decades on, sole suspect Darren Sapstead, from Chelmsford, Essex, has finally been ordered to face a jury accused of killing him. Charged: British kitchen fitter Garry Sapstead (left) will finally stand trial next week accused of pushing Garry Walton (right) to his death over the side of a pleasure boat in Tenerife 17 years ago . Sapstead, 38, who claims he is a victim of mistaken identity, faces up to 12 years in jail if convicted of Mr Walton's homicide in a trial starting on Monday. Several British holidaymakers who were with the pair on the cruise are expected to jet to Tenerife to give evidence, including two sisters who told police they saw the apprentice builder thrown into the sea. News of the trial today took the long-standing lawyer of Mr Walton's campaigning parents by surprise. Pedro Ripol, who is now retired, said: 'I spent years trying to get this case to court and had given up hope it would happen after all the setbacks Garry's parents have suffered. 'I'm delighted to hear it's going to trial. I'm flabbergasted I hadn't been told earlier by court officials.' Spanish authorities have faced criticism over their failure to put the case to rest quicker. Garry's heartbroken parents Catherine and Robert buried him thinking he had lost his life by accident. Was he pushed? Garry drowned after falling from a pleasure boat off the coast of Tenerife (above, file picture) after he had been taking part in drinking games . Sapstead, a father-of-three who was only extradited to Spain to face questioning nearly ten years after the incident, was yet to become a father when returned to Britain from the holiday immediately after Mr Walton's death. His lawyer said today he had been given permission to return to the UK in 2006 and continue living there while a judicial investigation against his client continued. Sapstead declined to comment ahead of his trial insisting: 'My eldest daughter is doing her GCSEs at the moment. 'She doesn't know anything about this and I don't want to upset her.' Mr Walton, who lived in Leeds for the first 15 years of his life before moving with his family to the village of Tooraneena near Dungarvan, County Waterford, died on November 7, 1996 after falling from a booze cruise on board a boat called Albatros. Spanish police took statements from holidaymakers on board the vessel, but were quoted at the time as saying they were satisfied Mr Walton's death was an accident. In the dark? It is not clear if Mr Walton's relatives know about Monday's trial and plan to travel to Tenerife (pictured) An investigating judge ordered Sapstead's extradition after reviewing case evidence. High Court Judge Lord Justice Kay approved the extradition request in November 2005, saying the facts behind Mr Walton's death were still obscure although it was clear he 'went overboard and drowned' at some point. Sapstead was allowed back to Britain to spend Christmas 2006 with wife Joanne and his children after several weeks in a Spanish jail. He is understood to have agreed to return to the island for Monday's trial voluntarily. Last night, state prosecutors in Spain said they would be accusing Sapstead of wanting to end his alleged victim's life after drunkenly approaching a girl beside him and asking her: 'Shall I throw him overboard?' They will also tell a jury at the start of his four-day trial in the Tenerife capital Santa Cruz that Sapstead threw him a life ring when he saw Mr Walton was in difficulties and tried to jump in the sea to help him before being stopped by other holidaymakers. Both Garry and his alleged killer had been guzzling alcohol from a funnel during several organised booze games on the cruise before the tragedy. Homicide, a charge that does not exist in English law, is a halfway house between manslaughter and the more serious charge of murder which in Spain is a wilful killing which must also be premeditated. Robert Sapstead two years after his son's death . As well as calling for a 12-year jail sentence, Spanish state prosecutors want Sapstead to compensate his alleged victim's family with €120,000 (£104,000) if he is found guilty. It was not clear last night if Mr Walton's relatives know about Monday's trial and plan to travel to Tenerife. Speaking two years after his son's death, Robert Sapstead said: 'We won't stop until we discover the truth. We owe it to Garry. 'It only needs one person to speak and the police will reopen the case. Garry was the most gentle loving and honest boy you could meet. 'He'd been looking forward to the holiday for ages, and he rang home to tell us he was having a brilliant time. 'He said he was going on a boat trip. That trip cost him his life.' Sapstead, speaking before he was extradited to Tenerife and warned he faced 18 months in jail on remand, insisted: 'I have nothing to hide and am happy to go to trial.

When he bought it for £6,500, it was little more than a shack to shelter in while he worked as a lifeguard. But Adam Wooler’s modest investment had the all-important factor…location. After razing it to the ground, he built an idyllic holiday home in its place which is now earning him £100,000 a year. Perched on the edge of a 300ft cliff, the chalet, with triple-glazed windows and heated floors, enjoys uninterrupted views of Whitsand Bay in Cornwall. Idyllic: Adam Wooler transformed a ramshackle shed into this stunning cliff-top retreat that earns more than £100,000 pounds a year in rent . View: The clifftop retreat boasts stunning coastal views of Whitsand Bay, in Cornwall . Cosy: Mr Wooler and his wife Katherine invested £100,000 to turn it into the luxury holiday retreat, which has a kitchen, lounge, bedroom, shower room and sun terrace . Mr Wooler, 47, bought the hut more than 25 years ago while he studied at Plymouth University. He did little with it for much of that . time, but after marrying and moving further along the coast to Dorset, . he and his new wife Katherine decided to invest £100,000 to create a . luxury bolthole. They now rent out the retreat all year . round for between £1,500 and £2,900 a week. With an occupancy rate of . 80 per cent, the annual return should be around £100,000. Aimed at couples looking for a . romantic break, the chalet, called The Edge, is already booked up for . most of the spring and summer. Married: Adam Wooler, with his wife Katherine, who transformed the hut he lived in as a student 25 years previously . Perfect position: The chalet has bi-folding patio doors to make the most of the uninterrupted coastal views . Booked up: The chalet, called The Edge, is aimed at honeymooners and couples looking for a romantic break, but is already full for most of spring and summer . Clifftop: The building is perched on the edge of a 300ft cliff, and was Mr Wooler's home while he was studying at university, before it was turned into the luxury retreat . Beautiful: Pop star Duffy has been one of the guests who have been able to enjoy stunning sunsets, such as this, while staying at the isolated seaside retreat . Mr Wooler said: ‘It was nothing more than a wooden shack on a cliff with one room and an outside loo when I bought it. ‘I lived in it for 18 months...and . nearly got blown away with it a few times. I left it as it was for 25 . years and couldn’t really afford to do anything with it. It has only . been the last 18 months that we managed to get the funding and planning . permission in place that we could really do something with it. Eco-friendly: The chalet measures 23ft by 13ft and has been made out of eco-friendly cedar wood . Inside: Along with being well insulated, the building has underfloor heating and triple-glazed windows . Ambitions: The couple hope to buy another chalet nearby and transform it into a holiday let geared up for families . Worth it: Mr Wooler said: 'People are happy to pay the rental price for it because of the views and the high standard finish' ‘We are delighted with how it has . turned out. It has been designed to make the most of the views and is . now a really romantic getaway.’ The Edge, which has one bedroom, a . kitchen, lounge and shower room, is made out of eco-friendly cedar wood.

Bidders will have the chance to own a piece of the Cumbrian coast when an historic four-mile stretch goes under the hammer. The length of Morecambe Bay foreshore (pictured below), from Roosebeck to Bardsea, will be split into five lots and sold separately at auction next week. The land, which includes pockets of woodland and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, belongs to John Poole, former senior partner of Poole Townsend, who bought it from the Crown around 18 months ago. Mr Poole has sold much of the surrounding land locally, but the five areas of foreshore remain 'superfluous' and Ulverston auctioneer Howard Whitaker has been tasked with selling them. Mr Whitaker said nearby former Crown plots of one acre to one-and-a-half-acres have sold for between £2,000 and £4,000. He said the title of the land dates back to William the Conqueror, who gave it to the first Baron le Fleming - whose family owned large amounts of land in Furness during the 12th and 13th centuries. But he said no matter the outcome, public access to the foreshore cannot be impeded, and the owner cannot remove the shingles or fence from the land. Ownership would give the highest bidder powers such as the authority to move on a travelling community or exercise the 28-day rule - which would allow them to reside on the land for up to a maximum of 28 days. The experienced auctioneer said he had never sold anything like this in almost half a century in the profession. 'It's a beauty spot, it's a pretty place in a lovely location and it's a very unusual sale,' said Mr Whitaker. 'In 46 years of professional auctioneering, I've never been asked to sell anything like this and I don't think I ever will again.'","Adam Wooler lived in timber shack while studying at university .

Toiling fewer than 40ft under the ocean floor, the men knew that one false pick stroke could be their last. With the roar of the sea in their ears, these brave miners were forced to tunnel closer and closer to the surface in their quest for tin. Stretching for more than a century, the dangerous work to extract metal from seams located under the Cornish coastline claimed many lives and was only ended by economic concerns. Gateway to the mines below the sea: The Crown Mines in operation in the 1860s. From this site a shaft was dug reaching 240 fathoms or 480 yards below the sea and workers could hear the waves crash above their head as they toiled . Relic of the past: The Crown Mines in Botallack were built in 1815 and closed a century later in 1914. Pictured is the remains of an engine house today . Now, the seabed near Land's End in west Cornwall is to be dredged to capture tin washed out there by the prolific land-based mines which operated nearby. But beneath the ocean floor lies a vast . labyrinth of tunnels extending more than a mile out to sea. The greatest . concentration of tin and copper submarine mining in the world is located . a few miles from Land’s End, notably the mines of Botallack, Levant and . Geevor. These run from west to east, and from earliest to most recent. The largest of these was Levant which was in operation for almost a . century during the 1800s, and then assimilated into Geevor which was one of the last . mines in Cornwall to close down in 1990. Yet the history of coastal mining in Cornwall stretches across the millennia, beginning in the Bronze Age, approximately three and a half thousand years ago. One of the most important finds substantiating this claim is the discovery at the cliff top Kenidjack Castle, near Botallack, west Cornwall, where 30 pieces of copper and smelted tin, along with axes of high tin content were excavated around this now-dilapidated fortress. The ‘Widow-Maker’ Drill: Deadly rock dust was created by such rock drills, powered by compressed air, before water jets were devised to absorb the lethal floating residue. Pictured right is a map of the submarine mines at Geevor, Levant and Botallack . More than 60 miles of intersecting tunnels lie beneath the Atlantic. In Levant, a blind miner often helped others navigate when their candles failed . Further evidence of this rich history is provided by the 4th Century BC Greek explorer Pytheas who visited the area of Land’s End, or ‘Belerian’, describing the courteous inhabitants’ production of tin and its subsequent haul to an island named ‘Ictis’, believed to be St. Michael’s Mount near Penzance, for international trade. There is evidence of mining in Botallack from ancient times, but the first records show a date of 1721. The ‘sett’ (area) of Botallack includes one of the most picturesque and romantic mines in the area: the Crown Mines. These engine houses are still perched perilously close to the sea upon an outcrop of rocks at the foot of the cliff. More striking still is the fact that from this post extends a diagonal shaft reaching down over 240 fathoms or 480 yards below sea level and extending almost the same distance out beneath the Atlantic Ocean. Modern submarine mining: The sub-incline shaft allowing access to Levant from Geevor. It was completed by 1977 and officially opened by the Queen in 1980 who braved its descent . New mine: A diver plugging the breach at the ¿40 Backs¿ area in the 1960s where the sea had infiltrated into the submarine levels of Levant. This was an unprecedented and award-winning engineering feat . Levant Beam Engine: A steam engine built in 1840, its claim to fame being that it is the oldest Cornish mine engine which also has remained in situ, and is to this day operational . From the mid 19th century tourists . would flock to these Crowns and some would even attempt a submarinal . descent. The most famous of these visitors being the Prince and Princess . of Wales – or more appropriately the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall – in . 1865, who were staying at St. Michael’s Mount. As . technology progressed with the Industrial Revolution, greater depths . could be mined as water could be mechanically pumped out in larger . quantities than buckets permitted. Mechanised fans also allowed for ventilation which was always an issue for submarine mining because ventilation shafts could not emerge vertically into air as they could inland. Levant, nicknamed ‘The Mine Under the Sea’, made effective use of this technology, becoming a leviathan in the mining industry. By 1820 it had submarine mines. One of its engines is to this day still ‘in steam’ and it can be witnessed by visiting the mine, now a tourist attraction run by the National Trust. However, despite this technological progress, conditions were still dangerous and toiling for the miners. Temperatures rose as miners descended with heat recorded at 30C at the deepest levels of 350 fathoms or 700 yards below sea level. Another fear for submarine miners was of course the incursion of the sea itself. At Levant lies an infamous level or tunnel known as the ’40 Backs’, named so because it ran a mere 40 feet from the seabed. In fact, the tunnel moved even closer to the seabed when miners followed a ‘lode’ or vein of ore, veering upwards. Some miners, known as tributers, would be paid according to the value of the ore they yielded – rather than ‘tut workers’ who were paid per fathom plunged – so their profit and danger ran parallel at this point. Here they could hear the crashing of . the waves and the thuds of boulders being thrown around by the power of . the currents above. Eventually the danger outweighed the potential . profits, and the place was abandoned. In . 1919, however, disaster did strike Levant. The so-called ‘man engine’ – . essentially an ingenious vacillating rod-lift carrying miners into and . out of the lower depths – when fully manned, became crippled and smashed . down through its deep shaft, killing thirty-one men and injuring many . more. Rusting now: The Skip Shaft lift at Levant (left). Ponies were sent through this shaft, tail first with legs tied to their bodies due to the shaft’s narrow width. They would remain working under the mine for years. Pictured right, pPart of the derelict machinery before the headgear of Victory Shaft, Geevor . Into the abyss: The Skip Shaft at Levant reaching down almost half a mile at 290 fathoms . The tragedy was the death knell of Levant mining, and was a substantial factor in its eventual closure in 1930. More than two decades prior to this a mine known as North Levant had become independent and renamed itself to Geevor. It outlived its southerly parent becoming very prosperous aided by the enhanced technology that the 20th Century provided. In the 1960s Geevor decided to extend its mining to submarine regions when it was realised that much more valuable tin and copper were waiting out there rather than inland. Living history: Some of the tunnels are now accessible to the public at Geevor Tin Mine . Dripping: Submarine mining became possible with the advent of mechanised pumps draining the tunnels from the water constantly seeping through the earth . Geevor’s matrix of tunnels would intersect with those undersea tunnels of Levant but first a problem needed remedying: it was discovered that after Levant mine had closed, the sea had indeed infiltrated its submarine tunnelling. The leak was at the fragile 40 Backs area. An unprecedented operation involving divers from Imperial College, London, and a 35-ton ex-Admiralty vessel, was set in motion to plug the breach. This was finally completed in 1969 with a total of 2,500 tons of cement being employed. The submarine mines were dry and mining once again began. Botallack Arsenic Labyrinth: As well as tin, copper and other metals, the mines also yielded arsenic. Any arsenic in the ore turned into a gas which then flowed into this labyrinth; there it cooled and solidified into arsenic crystals which could be recovered and sold . Exposed: A precarious cliff entrance to the submarine labyrinth, or ¿Lambreth¿ in the local dialect, that lies beyond the waves at Levant . Stunning: The picturesque Levant mine overlooking the Celtic Sea, part of the Atlantic. This area has recently been designated as a World Heritage Site along with the Great Wall of China, Stonehenge, and the Acropolis in Athens . By 1977 Geevor had tunnelled a sub-incline shaft for good access to these depths, a shaft that was officially opened by The Queen in1980. Before this unveiling, Her Majesty, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Andrew, had ventured down the shaft themselves in a similar manner to their forebears. Despite the wealth of copper, tin and other metals that lay there, Geevor had to close in 1990 due to the collapse of the global price of tin. However, Geevor now acts as a museum where visitors can not only access the industrial complex above ground but where they can also enter the shafts themselves. The submarine mines, however, cannot be accessed because they are once more submerged, not with sea water but with land drainage: once the pumps had stopped, rain water gradually made its way down into those deep 60 miles of submarine tunnelling – dormant now but perhaps awaiting a new era of good tin pricing and technology capable of once again exploiting the treasures that lie hundreds of fathoms under the sea.

Catholics don’t feel any guiltier about 'sexual sins' than members of other religions, a survey says. Baptists, Muslims and Pentecostals feel the most guilt about using pornography, contraception and engaging in premarital or extramarital sex, which suggests that the concept of ‘Catholic guilt’ is false. Sixteen per cent of religious people feel guilty about most or all of these four 'sexual sins', compared to only 3 per cent of those who do not belong to a religion, according to the poll by YouGov. Affair: Baptists, Muslims and Pentecostals feel the most guilt about using pornography, contraception, and engaging in premarital or extramarital sex, which suggests that the concept of 'Catholic guilt' is false . Some 14 per cent of Catholics said they would feel guilty across the range of the four 'sexual sins'. The survey found that using contraception would make 9 per cent of those who are ‘nominal’ (by name only) Catholics and 12 per cent of practising Catholics feel guilty, reported the Guardian. A big gap was found when considering attitudes towards premarital sex, which would make 20 per cent of religious people feel guilty - compared to only 5 per cent of the non-religious. Meanwhile, using pornography for sexual stimulation would make 15 per cent of non-religious people feel guilty, which is less than half the figure of religious people, at 33 per cent. Religious matters: The survey found that using contraception would make 9 per cent of those who are 'nominal' (by name only) Catholics and 12 per cent of practising Catholics feel guilty . Those belonging to the ‘least guilty’ bracket are men who are confident that their own judgment is authoritative, do not belong to any religion and are sure that there is no God. But the ‘guiltiest’ people are women who rely on religious sources for their authority in life, belong to a religion and are certain that a God exists. More than 4,000 adults were polled for the survey from January 25 to 30, reported the Guardian. The findings match the discovery of a 1988 study in the Journal of Rational-Emotive and Cognitive-Behavior Therapy, which found no difference in guilt levels between denominations, reported Time.","Baptists, Muslims and Pentecostals feel the most guilt about sexual sins .

Testing: Police officers will be forced to take strict fitness tests as an official report reveals that three-quarters of London officers are overweight or obese . Police officers are to be forced to take new fitness tests – and will have their pay slashed if they fail. Ministers are also planning to cut the wages of officers who take desk jobs because they claim their health is too poor for frontline duties. The move comes as The Mail on Sunday reveals the scale of the  ‘sicknote culture’ in the police. Our investigation shows that more than 5,300 officers in England and Wales have been placed on restricted backroom duties – usually on full pay – because they are deemed to be incapable of normal operational roles because of conditions such as ‘malaise’ or ‘fatigue’. But any crackdown on fitness is likely to lead to a fresh showdown between the Government and police. Ministers are already at loggerheads with officers over pay and conditions, and the ‘plebgate’ row between Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell and Downing Street police. However, the reforms, spearheaded by Police Minister Damian Green, aim to tackle fears that the public are being endangered by a ‘fat blue line’ too unfit to chase crooks. The Mail on Sunday investigation  found that in one force alone, a startling 500 specialist officers working in roles such as firearms and dog handling failed a fitness test. The shake-up has been inspired by Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor’s report into pay and conditions in the police. He recommended that the current fitness test, taken only by specialist officers, should be made more stringent. In place of the current ‘shuttle run’ in which officers sprint back and forth between lines 15 metres apart, Mr Green is likely to introduce an ‘assault course’ with crawling, jumping, balancing on a beam, climbing over a wall and dragging a weight. Anyone who fails the test three times will face ‘unsatisfactory performance’ procedures, which could lead to a pay cut. Mr Green is also determined to reduce the number of officers given back-office jobs after suffering injury or ill-health. Police placed on these duties for more than a year face losing eight per cent of their salary – and after two years could be forced to take ill-health retirement. Last night, Mr Green said the fitness tests would be introduced soon. And the Association  of Chief Police Officers confirmed: ‘Compulsory annual fitness testing for all officers has been agreed and a working group is planning its implementation. Proposals on restricted duties are still under  discussion.’ This newspaper asked all 39 English police forces to detail how many officers had been placed on restricted duties and why. The results revealed stark variations: while a shocking eight per cent of police on Merseyside and in Hertfordshire are on restricted duties, in Humberside the  figure is just one per cent. Out of the 21 forces that responded, 2,373 officers were on restricted duties, just over four per cent. Among all 134,101 officers in England and Wales, this would equate to more than 5,300 on such duties. All but a handful are on full pay. The 350 on Merseyside doing back-room work include a chief superintendent, a superintendent and two chief inspectors. A spokesman said: ‘These procedures allow officers to return to work in a meaningful role.’ In Thames Valley, the 137 police on restricted duties – three per cent of the force – include six with ‘malaise or fatigue’ and 85 with ‘musculo-skeletal’ problems. According to our figures, 508 out of the 10,156 specialist Metropolitan Police officers who took a fitness test in the past two years failed. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said that was just five per cent and added: ‘The individual is immediately taken off operational duties and given an action plan to increase their fitness.’ In Merseyside, 91 officers out of 2,685 failed the fitness tests. The highest fail rate was in Kent, with 6.5 per cent.","More than 5,300 officers on restricted backroom duties .

Tributes have been paid to a Preston granddad who graced the cobbles of British television’s most famous street for more than fifty years. Chris Canavan, who was the longest serving extra in Coronation Street, has died aged 84. Best known for being in the background in The Rovers Return in Weatherfield, Chris, who lived in Fulwood, died from a heart attack last Thursday. He had been in the show for almost as long as William Roache, who plays the soap’s longest running character Ken Barlow. Family and friends of Coronation Street extra Chris Canavan have paid tribute to him after his death aged 84 . Today, friends and Coronation Street colleagues paid tribute to a 'lovely character' with a passion for acting. A programme spokesman on behalf of Coronation Street said: 'We are very saddened to hear of Chris’ death he was a lovely man who was a pleasure to be around on set. 'He will be missed by everyone here at Coronation Street.' Chris, who was born in Belfast, was an extra in the show from 1962. On occasion he played characters including Dusty, the rat catcher and a window cleaner. He was the first ever customer in the shop on the cobbles, the Kabin and went on to be the first customer in the new Kabin. The majority of Chris’ extra work saw him in The Rovers, but he has also been spotted in Roy’s Rolls and he was at Rita and Dennis’s wedding. As a young man, Chris was in the Merchant Navy and later married his late wife Maureen. He got involved with drama groups and later trained at a drama school in Southport. He went on to take over a window cleaning firm and built it into a cleaning contract company, but he continued with his passion for acting in his spare time, joining Preston Drama Club and Broughton Players.

He was in a play directed by future Coronation Street star Roy Barraclough, which won prizes at Skipton Festival, catching the eye of a TV insider. Chris went on to secure parts in dozens of television programmes for both Granada and the BBC, including Prime Suspect, The Liver Birds and Brideshead Revisited with the legendary Sir Laurence Olivier. In an interview last year Chris said: 'Acting is a way of life. Performing was in the family.' Don Stephenson, chairman of Preston Drama Club said: 'He was a character, a lovely character. He was full of life, right up until being in his 80s. Chris Canavan worked as an extra on Coronation Street from the programme's early days in 1962 . 'He wasn’t the most reliable on the lines but he had a wonderful personality. He would give anecdotes on it (Coronation Street), he was very proud. He was still going down train even though he was in his 80s.' Adrienne Hurley, Chris’ neighbour and member of Broughton Players added: 'I have known him forever. We have lived next door to each other for 27 years. 'He has lived there all is married life, he lost his wife shortly before we moved in here. He has had a good long life but there has been a lot of sadness. He was very jolly and twinkly. 'He had a good, loud belly laugh, I used to hear it through the lounge wall.' She added: 'It was a terrible shock. It is very very sad.' Alex Tagg, from Preston Playhouse, said: 'He was a very friendly character. He used to say he left home in the early hours of the morning to be on set and they were awfully long days.' Chris leaves three children and four grandchildren.","Chris Canavan, first appeared in the soap as a background artist in 1962 .

Jailed: Helen Hart, 45, of Redruth, Cornwall, spent £6,000 on hiring a private jet to take her from Exeter to Paris and back . A secretary was jailed for four years today for swindling more than £300,000 from her bosses to fund a lavish lifestyle of private jets and sports cars. Helen Hart, 46, ran up astonishing bills including £5,990 for a return trip to Paris, £7,816 on a hotel stay in Devon, and £4,752 on tickets and hospitality for a Premier League football match. She also spent £31,368 on renovation work at her home. Judge John Neligan described her actions as 'a blatant and brazen breach of trust' when he sentenced her to four years in prison today. He told Hart: 'These . frauds - that is what they are - were committed over six and a half . years, while you were an employee in a senior and trusted position. 'You used the company money to fund a . lavish lifestyle, you used the company money to fund expensive luxurious . cars, in all about £65,000 one way or another was spent on cars. 'Taking everything into account and . the affect of a prison sentence on you, and on your parents, the least . sentence I can impose upon you is one of four years imprisonment.' She also admitted using the company’s cash to pay her rent and water bills, as well as spending £2,000 on a kitchen, £4,985 on 48 bottles of wine and an undisclosed sum on shopping at Marks and Spencer. Hart also confessed to spending the firm’s money on luxury cars including a Porsche Boxster and a Range Rover. She spent £46,500 on a Mercedes, too, using money kept in her Coutts bank account. Hart stole the cash from PDP Green Consulting Ltd, an architectural and engineering firm based in Truro, Cornwall. The missing money was first discovered when . the accounts of Cornish engineering firm PDP Green Consulting were wiped out - leaving . it facing an unpaid £271,000 tax bill in May 2011. She was accused of stealing more than £380,000 from the firm between October 2005 and May 2011, but Hart disputed the amount of money . stolen - claiming she had merely embezzled £190,000. But the court heard today that there was a financial loss of £325,000 through Hart's fraud, deception and theft. Guilty: Helen Hart, pictured left, admitted used money from the company owned by Philip Desmonde, pictured right with his wife Susanne, to pay her rent, water and Marks & Spencer shopping bills, as well as £2,000 on a kitchen and £5,000 on 48 bottles of wine . Offices: The money was taken from PDP Green Consulting (pictured), an architecture and civil engineering firm run based in Truro, Cornwall, where Hart worked as company secretary, the court heard . Victims: PDP Green Consulting Ltd boss Philip Desmonde, who ran the company Helen Hart stole from, and his wife Susanne arrive at the Truro Crown Court to see her sentenced . PDP Green Consulting Ltd boss Philip Desmonde and his family have claimed Hart spent much of the money trying to look and dress like his wife Susanne 'to push her out of his life'. Hart is accused of visiting the same hair salon, wearing the same clothes and even hiring the same fitness instructor as Susanne - echoing the plot of the 1992 movie Single White Female. Living a luxurious lifestyle on a modest £20,000 a year salary, she told her boss she inherited the fortune from a gangland uncle who was pals with the Kray Twins. At an earlier hearing Hart, of Illogan, Cornwall, admitted syphoning off cash to pay her £600-a-month rent and bills for four years. Tearful: Hart admitted using the money on rent, £2,000 on a kitchen and £5,000 on 48 bottles of wine . A further £2,000 was spent on a kitchen, £4,985 on 48 bottles of fine wine and other sums frittered away on designer shopping sprees, the court heard. Hart also liked to ride in luxury - buying a Porsche Boxster, BMW X5, Range Rover and a £46,500 Mercedes with money swindled from her employer. She even had an account at Coutts - the posh bank used by members of the Royal Family and mega-rich Premiership footballers. In March 2007 she ran up a hotel bill of £8,000 at Bovey Castle, a luxury hotel and golf course in Dartmoor National Park where rooms cost up to £689 a night. Roger Green, managing director of PDP Green who were conned by Helen Hart, was left disappointed at her four year jail sentence. He said last night: 'We are of course very pleased with the outcome of this case, although we feel the severity of Mrs Hart's crimes warranted a longer sentence. 'She has defrauded the company over a long period of time, abusing the trust placed in her by the directors of the company and her work colleagues and has shown no remorse for her actions.' Another victim was the charity Ella's Memory - founded by Martyn and Emmillie (COR) Selley in honour of their second child who was stillborn in December 2009. Married Hart offered the charity £10,000 in November 2010, claiming to have had a child who suffered a cot death, but the cheque bounced. She also promised to sponsor Truro Rugby Club after meeting one of its players, claiming she was a multi-millionairess with £10 million inheritance to spend. Detective Constable Nick Stidwill said: 'She drove luxury cars and dressed well giving the appearance of having money, all based on a fantasy that she had inherited enormous wealth. But the reality was PDP Green was funding it.' Luxurious location: Hart spent £7,800 on staying at the posh Bovey Castle hotel in Dartmoor, Devon .

Trotskyite past: Left-wing Simon Fletcher once accused Gordon Brown of 'pandering to fascism' in a newspaper article . A left-wing crony of Ken Livingstone who accused  Gordon Brown of ‘pandering to fascism’ and said Prince Charles talked ‘reactionary nonsense’ has been given a top job by Labour leader Ed Miliband. Simon Fletcher, who was Mr Livingstone’s chief-of-staff when he was Mayor of London, is Mr Miliband’s new adviser on trade unions. Mr Fletcher was a member of Mr Livingstone’s so-called ‘Kenocracy’, a group of close advisers when he was Mayor, and was said to be in Trotskyite group Socialist Action, which plotted to make London a ‘socialist city state’. After Mr Livingstone lost power to Boris Johnson in 2008, Mr Fletcher was deeply critical of Mr Miliband’s former boss Gordon Brown, who was then Prime Minister. In 2009, in an article in The Guardian newspaper headlined ‘Pandering to the fascists on housing’, Mr Fletcher denounced Mr Brown’s plan to make it easier for local families to get council homes. Mr Miliband, who was in Mr Brown’s Cabinet at the time, supported the scheme. Mr Fletcher wrote: ‘Gordon Brown’s plans for social housing allocation revive the myth perpetuated by the BNP that migrants force locals out. When he announced it he must have known he would reopen the debate on race and waiting lists, an issue the fascist British National Party has long sought to exploit. ‘The difficulties people encounter in getting a good affordable home are nothing to do with immigration. It is a myth. Pandering to the BNP or the lies that it has promoted and exploited does not weaken it. It strengthens it.’ He added that Mr Brown and his Government had ‘learned little from the debacle over its disastrous slogan ‘British jobs for British workers’. ‘Labour needs to start learning the lesson that defeating fascism cannot be done by first conceding to it,’ he wrote. Months earlier, Mr Fletcher rounded on Prince Charles for criticising the £3 billion development plan for Chelsea Barracks in West London by the rulers of Gulf state Qatar. Headed ‘Dragging London backwards’, he said Prince Charles’s ‘reactionary views on architecture would turn a vibrant city stale’ and told  him to ‘get out of the Chelsea Barracks row’. Top job: Labour leader Ed Miliband has appointed Simon Fletcher as his £50,000-a-year trade union officer . In the same year, he backed TUC general secretary Brendan Barber in a row over plans by Mr Brown’s administration to crack down on welfare cheats. He said: ‘As Brendan Barber argued, at a time of rapidly  rising unemployment, the Government needs to stop talking as if every benefit claimant is a potential scrounger. ‘Welfare debate in this country is too often dominated by an endless macho competition to see who can be toughest on “dependency culture”. ‘Labour should not chase the headline-chasing obsession with talking tough.’Mr Fletcher has been appointed Mr Miliband’s £50,000-a-year trade union liaison officer and will report directly to the Labour leader. He will be responsible for maintaining good relations between union barons and Mr Miliband.A biography of Mr Livingstone said his support for Socialist Action helped make it ‘probably the most successful and influential revolutionary Marxist organisation in Britain’. Mr Fletcher is believed to have received a six-figure payoff when he lost his job as the Mayor’s chief-of-staff in 2008. Mr Miliband’s office declined to comment. A Labour source said: ‘Simon has joined. He will be a very strong and valued addition to the team.’","Left-wing Simon Fletcher was Ken Livingstone's chief-of-staff when he was Mayor of London .

In most respects she's a normal teenager with a love of hanging out with friends and talking fashion, but 13-year-old Kyah DeSimone from Boston carries a purse with her that matters more than the recent trends - it powers her artificial heart. The teenager was rushed to hospital from a sleepover when she was just 10 years old. Doctors were shocked to realize she was suffering from heart failure as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition which slowly means the heart is too weak to pump. She has since been forced to make the agonizing wait for a heart transplant and, in the meantime, carries a purse with her at all times which includes a battery powering a chest pump or 'artificial heart' which keeps her alive.

Waiting: Kyah DeSimone, 13, from Hyannis, Massachusetts, pictured, is on the waiting list for a heart transplant. In the meantime a metal pump keeps her heart beating . Doctors had to fight to win the energetic teen the titanium pump, which has been surgically implanted into her chest, and is powered by a small portable battery. The small metal device wasn't yet approved for children but doctors asked for an emergency exemption saying they had no choice. Her frantic mother, Denise, a nurse, had little option but to watch and wait. 'I knew it was heart failure when I saw it,' she told ABC News. 'We didn't know if she would make it through the night,"" she said. 'It was the worst thing to watch, ever.' Dr. Christina VanderPluym, a pediatric cardiologist at Boston Children's Hospital, treated DeSimone and argued for the pump. 'In the past, we would just allow these kids to pass peacefully,' she said. 'But now we have ventricular assist devices small enough to put in children, and that's what we were able to use in Kyah.' How it works: This graphic by the FDA shows how Kyah's pump works. It fixes to her aorta and left ventricle and is powered via a wire through her abdomen. She carries her battery in a purse .

These workers carefully trim an elephant's valuable ivory tusk during a ceremony at Mahawangchang elephant camp in Kanchanaburi, Thailand. The tusks were legally trimmed to enable the animals to eat more easily. But it comes as the camp tries to raise awareness about poaching, and warn that cutting tusks without knowledge of its anatomy is dangerous for the animals. Workers legally trim an elephant's tusk during a ceremony at Mahawangchang elephant camp in Kanchanaburi, Thailand . Workers at the elephant camp carefully trimmed the elephants' tusks in an effort to raise public awareness about poaching and warn that cutting tusks without knowledge of its anatomy is dangerous for the animals . The tusks were legally trimmed to enable the beasts to eat more easily. According to conservationists the thriving legal trade in Thailand is helping fuel the slaughter of elephants in Africa . According to conservationists the thriving legal trade in Thailand is helping fuel the slaughter of elephants in Africa, where the largest land mammals on earth are facing their worst poaching epidemic in decades. Experts now believe more are being killed than are being born. The trade in 'blood ivory' will be among the most critical issues to be debated at the 177-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or CITES, which will begin on Sunday in Bangkok. And Thailand, which is hosting the meeting, will be under particular pressure to take action. It is not only a major hub for illegally trafficked wildlife - it is also where much of the ivory smuggled out of Africa ends up. 'Instead of being part of the problem, the Thai government can be part of the solution by banning ivory sales' altogether within its borders, said Janpai Ongsiriwittaya of the World Wildlife Fund. Last week, the conservation group presented a global petition with more than half a million signatures to Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, calling on her government to do just that. The trade is currently legal in Thailand as long as it involves tusks that came from native herds that have been domesticated. Yingluck responded by saying she recognised the importance of elephant conservation and would take the plea into consideration. Thai wildlife officials have ruled out an all-out ban on ivory in the past because those Thais who legitimately own domesticated animals should also have the right to buy and sell tusks locally. But once ivory enters Thai markets either legally or illegally it is difficult to trace where it came from. Nevertheless, 'most of the supply we see in Thai markets is illegally smuggled in from Africa,' Janpai said. Thai custom officials display seized ivory tusks during a news conference at the customs office of Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok. Thailand allows its nationals to trade in ivory from elephants that have died of natural causes inside its borders . Thailand is not only a major hub for illegally trafficked wildlife, it is also where much of the ivory smuggled out of Africa ends up . Thailand itself is home to about 6,500 elephants, of which 2,500 are wild and off-limits. Of the remaining 4,000, only 1,500 are males that produce tusks, and many grow only one in their lifetimes. By contrast, there are an estimated 5,000 ivory traders doing business in the country, far more than the local supply should be able to support, Janpai said. Scanlon said the illegal wildlife trade is worth up to $20 billion per year globally. And to control it, the international community has to be willing to 'deploy the sorts of techniques that are being deployed with respect to narcotics,' he said. Around 70 years ago, up to 5 million elephants are believed to have roamed sub-Saharan Africa. Today, just several hundred thousand are left, 25,000 of which were killed in 2011. Figures for 2012 have yet to be released, but they are believed to be similar to the previous year, or worse, Scanlon said. An elephant handler takes a nap as he waits for tourists. A meeting to be held in Bangkok on Sunday will put the spotlight on Thailand's role in the illicit trade in African ivory . Thailand will host the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meeting from Sunday until March 14 . Although all African states agree no elephant should be killed for its tusks, there is disagreement over how best to protect the iconic animals. Some argue that legalising the ivory trade within reason give upon the animals a monetary worth that encourages humans to value their survival. But others say the only to stop poaching is to outlaw the sale of ivory everywhere, killing demand and ending their slaughter. Thailand's government has said it has done what it can. In the past two years, customs officers here have seized close to 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds) of African tusks, sometimes found broken apart into small pieces in failed attempts to avoid detection. TRAFFIC has called for CITES members to impose trade sanctions against Thailand - along with Nigeria and Congo - alleging they are complicit in the illegal ivory trade. 'There's certainly an issue here, it's been dealt with more slowly than many would like,' Scanlon said. But sanctions, he said, were premature and Thailand needs to be given the opportunity to put in place new measures to ensure they are 'not allowing laundered African ivory into this system.'","The tusks were legally trimmed to enable animals to eat more easily .

And now, to celebrate her unique place in British history, a statue of Lady Thatcher could be erected in her home town of Grantham, after Labour councillors changed their minds and backed the proposal. Until now, the Lincolnshire market town town had been split over plans for a statue of Lady Thatcher with some fearing it could be a target for vandals and protesters.

More than two decades after her fall . from power, it had been suggested that Grantham Museum could house a repaired white marble statue. Grantham museum said that any . decision would be taken with the views of local residents in mind but that proposal is off the table. But Lady Thatcher seems to have found an unlikely ally, with Labour councillors proposing a separate commemorative work to attract tourists, the Daily Telegraph reported. Charmaine Morgan, has called on the Conservative majority to support an exhibit and statue or bust of Lady Thatcher. The statue of Margaret Thatcher at the Guildhall Art Gallery . She told the Daily Telegraph: 'Despite our personal strength of feeling about her, we feel the controversy and outside interest around Lady Thatcher provides an opportunity to attract international tourists to our town.' The . 8ft £150,000 artwork originally proposed was made by sculptor Neil Simmons and commissioned by the . House of Commons and was decapitated by a protester within weeks of . going on display at a gallery in the City of London in 2002. It has spent much of the period since its repair in storage at the Commons. Cllr Morgan previously suggested that displaying a monument to Lady Thatcher could be ‘asking . for trouble’. She said some of Lady Thatcher’s policies . remain controversial and the statue might be open to more attacks if it . was erected in her home town. ‘Placing it anywhere in a public place in .

A couple have spoken of their joy at bringing up a son whom they adopted after finding him abandoned in a New York subway station. After the chance discovery of a day-old baby, they handed him over to the authorities - only for a judge to ask if they wanted to take him home with them. And 12 years later, they were reunited with the judge who brought their family together when she presided at their wedding. Discovery: Peter Mercurio, left, and Danny Stewart, right, found a baby abandoned on the subway . Danny Stewart was returning home to his partner Peter Mercurio in August 2000 when he made the discovery which would change his life, according to the New York Times. He saw what he thought was a doll abandoned on a stairway in a New York subway station - but he soon realised it was in fact a tiny baby, so young his umbilical cord had not yet been cut off. The social worker instantly called the police, and after a few minutes he panicked and phoned Mr Mercurio, shouting: 'I found a baby! I called 911, but I don't think they believed me.' The couple waited together until the authorities came and took the child to safety, and Mr Stewart found minor fame when the local media reported that he had probably saved the baby's life. In December that year, he was asked to appear in court to testify about how he found the boy, when and suddenly the judge asked, 'Would you be interested in adopting this baby?' Mr Stewart instantly said yes - without consulting Mr Mercurio, who was initially furious but quickly realised that it might be the only way the couple could ever have a child. Subway: The chance discovery led to the couple starting a new family and life together . When they were first allowed to hold the baby, they knew they could hardly bear to be apart from him again. Mr Mercurio wrote: 'With the baby's eyes staring up at me, and all the innocence and hope he represented, I, like Danny, was completely hooked.' The pair were unexpected given custody of the boy with just 36 hours' notice, and started their life together that Christmas. Their new son, who was originally known as 'Baby ACE' because the station where he was found was on the A, C and E subway lines, was re-named Kevin. The family had no contact with the judge who had brought them together until 2011, when they decided to wed after gay marriage was legalised in New York. Kevin suggested that they should ask the same judge to officiate their wedding, so they contacted her through the court service and she said that she would be delighted to meet them again. When they walked in to the court room, Kevin held out his hand to greet the woman who had given him his parents - but she insisted on hugging him instead.

During his opening monologue at the 85th annual Academy Awards, host Seth MacFarlane took a moment to elaborate jokes that showed his bad taste, including a tune titled 'We Saw Your Boobs.' The Family Guy comedian got the ball rolling with a self-effacing opening monologue that predicted he would go down in history as the worst host ever of the prestigious awards show. Scroll down for video... Wild humour: Seth MacFarlane opened the 85th annual Academy Awards with a controversial tune titled 'We Saw Your Boobs' Alone on the stage, he delivered a series of one-liners, most of which scored, before he rattled off a list of perfunctory celebrity bashing jokes, including one that took a stab at the Academy itself. He quickly brought up one of the most contentious choices by the Academy this year to not nominate Argo for best director, despite getting nods in all other top categories -- and Ben Affleck's win at the Director's Guild Awards. 'The film is based on classified CIA files.... The story was so top secret that the film's director is  unknown to the academy,' Seth joked. The stage is all his: Critics predicted the Family Guy creator's humour may be tough to swallow . But then things turned sour as Seth tried to inject some humour into a line about the violent Quentin Tarantino western Django Unchained. 'This is the story of a man fighting to get back his woman, who's been subjected to unthinkable violence -- or as Chris Brown and Rihanna call it, a date movie.' The energy in the room cooled as the crowd laughed nervously, forcing him to reply with an assurance that the joke was 'as bad as it gets, if it makes you feel better.' Back from the future: William Shatner, dressed as Captain Kirk, comes from the future to save the show . Ominous prediction: William shows Seth a title from a newspaper the next day . 'Oh no, that's what we were afraid he would do,' he said, mimicking the audience's response. He followed it up with another diss at Tarantino's film -- which he later won an award for Best Screenplay. Talking . about the film's controversial overuse of the n-word, Seth drew silence . from the crowd when he joked that the screenplay was 'loosely based on . Mel Gibon's voicemails.' 'What, now you're all on his side?' he asked, clearly showing that he is uncomfortable with criticism.After a few boos, he replied with a promise that 'it's really not as bad as it gets.' In interviews beforehand, he had spoken of his hope to strike a balance between respect for Hollywood and some necessary sass. Mission accomplished, as even critics from Vanity Fair lauded the actor. 'Loving that MacFarlane is attempting to preempt his #Oscars criticism,' the magazine posted on their Twitter account Sunday. Song and dance: William then shows a clip from the show in which Seth sings a song titled 'We Say Your Boobs' Stifled laughter: His song is met with mixed emotion . But before he can continue on his . downward spiral, Seth is interrupted by William Shatner dressed as a . time travelling Captain Kirk, a role he made famous on the Star Trek . television series. Shatner immediately criticizes the handsome funnyman in an attempt to stop him from 'destroying the Academy Awards.' 'The show's a disaster. Your jokes are tasteless and inappropriate and everyone ends up hating you,' Shatner forewarned. He . then showed Seth a copy of a newspaper headline from the day after the . awards that read 'Seth MacFarlane Worst Oscar host ever.' Not amuzed: Charlize Theron looked agitated in the pre-recorded bit when he mentioned her role in Monster . We saw her boobs: Naomi Watts drew looks from the audience in the skit . Horrified: Naomi's face nearly went pale as she played along with the joke . Playing innocent, Seth tries to defend himself and asks what he did wrong. With that, Shatner plays for Seth a pre-taped production number featuring the comedian singing and dancing to a crude tune titled 'We Saw Your Boobs.' The melody showcases Seth's singing prowess as he's backed by an all men's choir. Honourable mention: Jennifer Lawrence was also mentioned in the spoof, and she gave a thumbs up . The song, which oft repeated the titular . phrase, called out actresses in the audience that have exposed their . chest in some of their most famous roles. Playing along with the joke, Naomi Watts looked horrified when he mentioned her name. Next, Charlize Theron bowed her head low and avoided the camera at the mention of her breast-exposing performance in Monster. But the always jubilant Jennifer Lawrence relished at the nod, giving a glad hands up to the cameras. Musical theme: There were many musical breaks during the show, many of which Seth partook in . Though it was clear the women were looped into the pre-recorded piece, the reaction from the internet was mixed. And . in a matter of moments, #WeSawYourBoobs became a popular hashtag on . Twitter and Seth McFarlane was one of the trending topics on the . micro-blogging site. Television host Piers Morgan was quick to show his support for the comedian. 'This is unbelievably, unacceptably, gob-smackingly, hilariously inappropriate. Keep going. @SethMacFarlane #WeSawYourBoobs' People Magazine also threw in some praise: 'If you're hating on Seth, just remember: He's got Channing up there dancing.' Dancing with the stars: Seth sang Frank Sinatra's The Way You Look Tonight as Chaning Tatum and Charlize Theron took the stage . Stunning performance: Dustin Hoffman later told Charlize she was a 'beautiful dancer' On the other side of the fence, celebrity blogger Perez Hilton was one of the most vocal critics of the performance. 'That song @SethMacFarlane did made me wish he just stuck to telling mildly funny jokes! #Oscars,' he wrote. In an effort to change the course of . history, he used the remainder of his 15 minutes to redeem himself, . starting with a sensual dance by Charlize Theron and Channing Tatum to . his rendition of Frank Sinatra's The Way You Look Tonight.' Not good enough, said Shatner, who . then revealed a video clip where MacFarlane, costumed in a Flying Nun . habit, hit on Oscar nominee Sally Field in the green room.

Savita's parents Anadappa Yalgi, 62, and . his wife Akka Mahadevi Yalgi, 54, met with municipal government . officials late on Friday afternoon at the family home in Belgaum, South . West India. The grieving couple asked Belgaum's . Deputy Commissioner, Anbu Kumar, to help ensure every possible . assistance from the Indian government. Mr Kumar said of the encounter: 'I visited the house and offered our government's help where possible.' Seeking justice: Belgaum's deputy commissioner, Anbu Kumar (left) promised Savita's father Anadappa Yalgi all possible help . Paying respects: The deputy commissioner paused for a moment of reflection before Savita's shrine . Savita's mother, left, had asked her daughter to return to Belgaum to give birth, but Savita felt she would be safer in Ireland . A photo of Savita now hangs in the family home covered in a garland, as is traditional in India's Hindu community after the death of a loved one. Echoing comments made by her parents, India's ambassador to Ireland said today that Mrs Halappanavar might still be alive today if she had been treated in India. Debashish Chakravarti told RTÉ radio that he hoped the Irish government would take steps to ensure the circumstances which led to her death never arose again. Abortion is not illegal in India when the mother's life is at risk, the ambassador noted. Meanwhile Ireland's ambassador to India, Feilim McLaughlin, was officially summoned by the Delhi government on Friday to discuss an inquiry into Mrs Halappanavar's death. Madhusudan Ganapathi, secretary (west) in the external affairs ministry, told the Irish envoy he hoped the inquiry into the tragedy would be independent. He also conveyed the sadness felt by people in India as 'a young life had come to an untimely end'. India's External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said of the tragedy: ""Saving the life of the mother is of prime importance, if you can't save the life of the child."" Devastated: Praveen Halappanavar (pictured with his wife Savita at their home in Galway) says he watched helplessly as she died from blood poisoning from a miscarriage after doctors refused to perform an abortion . Savita Halappanavar, 31, died at Galway University Hospital, where doctors refused to perform a medical termination because she was 'in a Catholic country' and the foetus's heartbeat was still present . Mr Halappanavar, Savita's husband, has described how he held her hand as she died. Reliving her final moments, he said: 'In the night, at around one o'clock, the nurse came running, as I was standing outside ICU. 'She just told me to be brave, and she took me near Savita, and she said: “Will you be OK to be there, living her last minutes? 'I said: “Yes, I want to”. I was holding her hand, they were trying to pump her heart, there was a big team around. The doctor just told me they lost her.' Mr Halappanavar, who works as an engineer at Boston Scientific in Galway, came to Ireland from India with his wife four years ago to start a new life together. She had a job in Westport, Co Mayo and the pair lived in Galway city. Public outcry: The tragedy has provoked a huge amount of soul searching in the Republic of Ireland, where campaigners are demanding a change in the law to allow abortions when the mother's life is in danger . Happy couple: Savita and her husband Praveen dancing at 2010 Diwali festival in Galway, video from YouTube . They were so excited about the expected birth of their first child, which was due on March 20, that they had an early baby shower in recent weeks when Mrs Halappanavar’s parents were visiting. Pro-choice activists in Ireland have turned to social media networks to organise a mass protest against the country's abortion laws on Saturday. A rally in central Dublin is expected to attract several thousand demonstrators, and follows similar rallies on Thursday night in Belfast and on Friday in Derry. New Delhi maintained diplomatic . pressure on Dublin on the death of an Indian dentist in Ireland, with . anger mounting in India over the issue. Debashish Chakravarti, the Indian ambassador to Ireland, met the deputy . Prime Minister and foreign minister Eamon Gilmore on Friday to convey . India's concern at the death of Dr Savita Halappanavar, the Galway-based . dentist. India has also demanded that steps be taken so that such an incident doesn't recur. Savita, . 31, died because of blood poisoning after doctors allegedly refused to . terminate her 17- week pregnancy, telling her that abortion wasn't . allowed in Ireland, a Catholic country. The envoy also conveyed India's desire for an independent probe into the matter. Gilmore . indicated that they were sensitive to the impact of the tragedy on . public opinion and civil society and assured that the probe being . conducted by the country's Health Services Executive would be assisted . by an independent medical professional. Ireland has also given an assurance that the probe would be completed at an early date. Meanwhile, . Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said he is awaiting a report by an . expert group on the issue but will not be rushed into an immediate . decision on the right to abortion.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:39 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:08 EST, 1 March 2013 . A police officer who investigated a Zumba instructor's alleged prostitution business has testified that she found an 'assortment of condoms', four bottles of baby oil, cameras, a planner and $1,000 cash at the woman's residence. Audra Presby took to the stand for the second day in the trial of Mark Strong, who is accused of promoting prostitution with business partner and Zumba teacher Alexis Wright in Kennebunk, Maine. Presby testified she had also seized several . computer hard drives, a laptop, checkbooks and personal lubricants from Wright's businesses, home and vehicle during a February 2012 search. Explicit: Testimony is underway in case of Mark Strong who is accused of promoting prostitution with Zumba instructor Alexis Wright, pictured. The jury has seen explicit material of her engaging in sexual activities . The discoveries were made during the prostitution investigation, to which Presby was assigned in October 2011 following complaint of suspicious activity at Wright's Pura Vida Zumba . studio. While Presby initially failed to make any discoveries of suspicious activity, she carried out internet searches and came across a blog that caught her attention, the Portland Press Herald reported. 'When I performed the online search, . not only did I find this site, Sensual Body Works by Lydia, I also found... online sex videos of this individual,' Presby said. Another agent called the number listed on the blog and posed as a client to ask whether an hour massage would get him sex. On the tape, which was played in the court, she responds: 'OK.' Stash: Officers searched . her Pure Vida Zumba exercise studio in downtown Kennebunk, Maine, pictured . Business: Police found lubricants, an assortment of condoms and baby oil in Wright's home and studio . Police continued to gather evidence and obtained and executed a search warrant . at Wright's Zumba studio, her business office, . her home in Wells and her vehicle where they found the items, she said. Wright also had a . badge and state identification as an assistant investigator in her possession, which she . had after studying under Strong to be a private investigator, his attorney said. Presby also testified that she linked Strong to the case after seeing a sex . video of him and Wright and matching his face and voice to the video appearances. Strong . allegedly watched sexual encounters between Wright and her clients through a live computer webcam and . spoke with Wright when the men were out of the . room. 'I remember keeping the logs of the hours [spent watching sexually . explicit evidence],' Presby said. 'I know at one point I was well over 80 hours, and by the . end, I was closer to 120 hours.' Not guilty: Mark Strong (right) admits he had an affair with Wright - but they argue he didn't know she was running an alleged . prostitution business . Seductive: Mark Strong, a married father of two, . allegedly sat at his home computer and watched Alexis Wright have sex . with several men via live-streaming video over Skype . Strong and his attorney have argued that . Presby unfairly unfocused the investigation on him as revenge for research he had carried out into her alleged misconduct. Strong has argued he was investigating Presby's 2009 affair with her married then-supervisor . Nicholas Higgins, and allegations by Higgins' former . wife that Presby had inappropriate sexual contact with the couple's five-year-old son, the Bangor Daily News reported. Kennebunk police Lt. Daniel Jones testified earlier in the trial that a Maine State Police . investigation into the accusations determined there was 'no criminal . action' by Presby. But she was reprimanded for the affair. The defense cross-examination of Presby was expected to last throughout the afternoon on Friday. Strong, 57, of Thomaston, is on trial on 13 counts related to promotion of prostitution. Wright will be tried later. Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, is slated to stand trial in May. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges . The insight from Presby comes after . jurors were shown a video of Wright having sex with a 61-year-old man on . a massage table in exchange for $250, while Strong allegedly watched . from his home computer via Skype. The damning evidence, recorded by . Wright herself on a camera hidden in a nest of lingerie, shows her . negotiating a fee and then collecting a pile of cash after she finishes. Prosecutors . argue that Strong was listening in and watching live via Skype during . the entire encounter and later discussed booking other johns for Wright - . pushing her to sleep with three clients in one day instead of two. In between clients, she discusses her . schedule of clients with a man who is watching through the video . camera. Prosecutors say that man is Strong, according to Seacoast Online. 'I'd like to schedule only two one-hour appointments tomorrow instead of 45,' Wright says, talking to the camera. Battle: Attorney Daniel Lilley, who is representing Strong, speaks in court in Alfred, Maine. He has conceded Strong might have watched her having sex but said he was not involved in prostitution . 'Nice to get three in somehow,” the man's voice says. When Wright says that she has 'school' the next day, the man suggests she 'fit three in today.' Wright says that would be 'pushing it.' The man's voice later asks which clients he should try to book for her. The time stamp on the 36-minute video . shown the jurors, which was seized from Wright's home, corresponds with . the time on 45 Skype video screen shots that were downloaded from Strong's computer, an investigator testified. Seacoast Online reports that in other videos, the pair discuss rates and sexual services that Wright offers. Strong, a married father of two, says he funded Wright's exercise . studio with a loan and acted as her business partner. On trial: Strong has pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of promoting prostitution and one count of invasion of privacy . He . also admits that he had an affair with her and his lawyers concede that . he may have watched her online as she had sex with other men. However, his . lawyers argue Strong, a local real estate broker and private . investigator, had no idea Wright was allegedly receiving money for the . sex or that she was running a prostitution business. Prosecutors say the video shows that . Strong not only knew Wright was having sex for money, he was helping her . book and schedule johns. Jurors also saw a video of the . alleged Zumba prostitute dropping her towel and posing naked in front of . the windows of her Maine exercise studio. Jurors also saw about two dozen pictures Strong . captured on his home computer while he watched live Skype broadcasts of . Wright allegedly having sex with johns in her Zumba exercise studio. Detectives say they recovered 13,000 . still images from Strong's computer, many of them sexually explicit . pictures that he captured from videos of Wright having sex with alleged . johns. Wright's alleged clients include wealthy and well-known figures in southern Maine. So far, 18 men have pleaded guilty to paying Wright for sex . On Wednesday, Justice Nancy Mills ruled . that the prosecution should show only 100 of the photos to the jury - to . illustrate the Wright invited multiple men into her studio for sex on . multiple occasions. Prosecutors initially wanted to show 577 to the jury. Defense lawyers strenuously objected before the material was introduced and continued to object after jurors saw the video and the pictures. They say Strong is just a 'voyeur.' 'It . may be Mr. Strong observed the sexual acts of Ms. Wright with other . people, but I don't think it shows promotion of prostitution,' Daniel . Lilley told the judge. 'These are all very sexual acts and very sexual positions.' Wright has pleaded not guilty to charges of prostitution and invasion of privacy. Her trial is scheduled for May.","Mark Strong, the business partner for 'Zumba prostitute' Alexis Wright, is on trial facing charges of promoting prostitution .

Extreme security measures have been introduced at an airport after thousands of dollars worth of damage was caused to cars by rabbits. Wildlife experts are now building perches around the car park at Denver International Airport for hawks and eagles to rest so they can easily spot and prey on the rabbits. New fences are also being constructed to make it harder for bunnies to burrow under while local car mechanics are spraying wires with coyote or fox urine which repels rabbits. Scroll down to watch the video . Furry nuisance: Numerous cars parked at Denver International Airport have been damage by rabbits chewing through ignition cables . Deterrents: US Airport Parking is now bringing in new extreme measures to deal with the rabbits at Denver International Airport . It comes after hundreds of cars were left damaged while parked at the airport because of rabbits eat through under-car wires. At least 100 rabbits are being removed by the USDA Wildlife Service from the airport car park every month while better defences are put in place. Airport shuttle driver Michelle Anderson told KCNC-TV: 'I see at least dozens every morning. They go hide under the cars and the cars are warm.' US Airport Parking said they are trying to get the situation under control by using the most natural techniques as possible. Local mechanics are spraying the car wires with coyote and fox urine to deter the rabbits from chewing them . This includes encouraging hawks and eagles to hunt the rabbits around the airport as well as introducing better fencing. But local mechanics have suggested another tactic for drivers to try to prevent rabbits damaging their cars - coyote and fox urine. Arapahoe Autotek spokesman Wiley Faris told the TV station: 'They like to chew on the insulator portion of the ignition cables. That’s what we see. 'We have found a good deterrent is predator urine, you can pick up fox urine at any pro hunting shop.' Investment: US Airport Parking is constructing better fencing around the car park that will prevent rabbits from burrowing underneath . Prey: Perches are also being constructed around the car park to encourage hawks and eagles to hunt the rabbits . DIA and City of Denver officials said they have only received a handful of claims over rabbit damage to cars but that repairs needed because of animals are the responsibility of the driver. Since 2009 there have been nine official claims from passengers reporting damage to their cars from rabbits but most insurance companies won't cover the costs of rabbit damage. But Denver isn't the only airport to have a rabbit problem. Laura Coale, a spokeswoman for the Colorado airport, said out of 4.3 million parking transactions last year, three claims were submitted for rodent or rabbit damage.

Idea: Music fan Richard Davies created Twickets over frustration at high ticket prices and empty seats at 'sold out' events . It is a situation which many people have been faced with. Tickets to that all important event you are desperate to see are sold out. The only option left is to pay way over face value through secondary websites or touts. But that could all be about to change thanks to one of the UK's fastest growing businesses. Music fan Richard Davies created Twickets after he saw a fan offering to give away tickets to a show for free on Twitter instead of letting them go to waste. The London-based web designer believed that other people with tickets to events which they were unable to attend would rather sell them to real fans at face value or less instead of through expensive secondary ticket websites. He went on to create @Twickets in 2011 with the rule that all tickets must be sold at face value or less. The business has so far allowed people to sell on 45,000 'spare' tickets to events. It follows anger rising in recent years over the cost of tickets through secondary websites such as Viagogo and Seatwave which mark up the price of tickets immediately after sale at the box office. This has allowed Twickets to surge in popularity. Mr Davies, 45, said: . 'First and foremost it was set up to reduce empty seats at events which . were supposedly sold out. 'I thought one of the reasons for . that was because people cannot exchange tickets at the last minute if . they have a change of plans. 'The . other important thing is to ensure that fans are not being ripped off by overpriced tickets going spare by the expensive secondary ticket . sites. 'It has been phenomenal and everybody has been very supportive and positive.' This morning, tickets being offered for . sale included Southampton v QPR for a face value price of £35 and two . spare tickets for a Justin Bieber concert tonight at the Nottingham Arena . for £50 each. Success: Twickets was created in 2011 with the rule that all tickets must be sold at face value or less . Bargain: Two spare tickets for a Justin Bieber concert this evening at the Nottingham Arena for being offered for £50 each this morning . Girls Aloud tickets at the O2 Arena . which cost £110 on Viagogo cost just £42 on Twickets. While two tickets . to see The Book of Mormon at the Prince of Wales Theatre cost £110 on Twickets compared to £293.15 on Viagogo. Last week a Twickets iPhone app went on sale and topped the iTunes new app chart with 30,000 downloads. Its Twitter page has almost 14,000 followers with fans constantly tweeting ticket offers. Speaking to The Independent, Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, who is campaigning to prevent ticket touts said: 'Fans are being squeezed out of gigs and shows thanks to unscrupulous touts exploiting the talent of others. 'Twickets is what the secondary market should be about: true fans selling to true fans at face value.'","Richard Davies created Twickets after seeing a fan give away free tickets .

A transsexual builder who had a £10,000 sex change is suing health bosses after they refused her a breast enlargement operation on the NHS. Cathy Daniels - born Keith Daniels - wants taxpayers to fund the £5,000 procedure but her GP will not refer her. The 53-year-old father-of-three, who had gender realignment surgery two years ago, wants the surgery to fully complete her sex change. She plans to take legal action because without breasts she feels 'half man, half woman'. Legal action: Transsexual builder Cathy Daniels is suing health bosses after they refused her a breast enlargement operation on the NHS . Miss Daniels, from Burnley, Lancashire, said: 'I have had to face another Christmas half man, half woman, and that is devastating. 'The Primary Care Trust (PCT) has officially reviewed my case and confirmed they will not be funding my breast augmentation.' Miss Daniels, who first realised she was trapped in the wrong body aged eight, intends to instruct solicitors on her behalf after the festive period next week. Miss Daniels has enlisted . the help of transsexual Miranda Lee in her fight for the right to breast augmentation on the NHS. The 40-year-old (pictured) made headlines in 2009 after she won the right to have £8,000 breast implants – following a battle funded by £10,000 of legal aid. Miss Lee, from Southend, . Essex, had gender realignment surgery in 2009, paid for with NHS money. The process was due to be completed with the breast augmentation, but she was then told the money would not be made available. Miss Lee, who also complained that she had been left ‘half man, half woman’, attempted suicide and was placed on anti-depressants. She decided to fight the decision and was granted legal aid in June 2010. Her case was heard by an NHS review panel in November 2010, which a month later ruled in her favour. The charity shop worker said she was delighted at the U-turn but wanted compensation for the stress of her ‘inhumane and insensitive’ treatment. She said: 'Nobody can imagine what it is . like to be trapped in the wrong body and to know that I am only one . step away from being who I want to be is heartbreaking, especially as . breasts are a really important part of being a woman.' Miss Daniels, who blames the failure . of her four marriages on her taste for cross-dressing, underwent the sex . change at Charing Cross Hospital in London in 2009. She added: 'I have undergone half the operation, but now I’m being kept in limbo because apparently there is no funds. 'Breasts are a really important part of being a woman and being like this is making me suicidal. 'It’s horrible. I’m neither one or the other. My lower half is a woman but my top half is a man.' But health bosses said the operation is a cosmetic procedure that is not routinely funded by NHS East Lancashire Primary Care Trust. A . spokesman said: 'Breast . augmentation is not a procedure routinely funded by NHS East Lancashire . as this is considered to be a cosmetic procedure. 'Currently, breast reconstruction is only funded following mastectomy for patients who have had breast cancer.' Burnley MP Gordon Birtwistle backed the health trust’s stance. He said: 'Money should be spent on life-saving and urgent-care treatment rather than on cosmetic surgery. 'With everything that has happened in Burnley, including the closure of the children’s ward and A&E department, cosmetic procedures have to become a second priority.' Ms Daniels, who has HIV, lives with her partner, who she met on the internet. She . said: 'He is the only thing that stops me doing anything silly but he . knows how much I need to have the second part of this operation.'","Cathy Daniels is 'half man, half woman' without breasts .

Kenney admitted to having hypnotized 17-year-old Brittany Palumbo five months . before she killed herself on May 4 last year. He also held hypnosis sessions with . 16-year-old Marcus Freeman six days before he died in a car wreck on . March 15. All three were students at his school. A report was filed by school chiefs last June . who found that Kenney had lied to officials about hypnosis sessions and . defied three separate orders to stop the practice. He first told police he never hypnotized Miss Palumbo but later admitted he had lied. A teacher at the school, Linda Thornton, 68, was also killed in a car wreck while driving to work in November 2010. It is not known whether she was hypnotized by Kenney. Kenney has claimed the students were . happy to be hypnotized as it helped them concentrate in class. Many had . been taking part in competitive sports and he said the hypnosis helped . them focus. In defence: Students including (l-r) Kallie Dremann, Eric Williams and Josh Lang have all been hypnotised by their former principal Dr Kenney . Private sessions: Dr Kenney is said to have hypnotised 75 pupils, teachers and members of their families at North Port High School in Florida . Many pupils at North Port High School have come out to defend Dr Kenney and Facebook groups have been set up called 'Bring Back Dr Kenney' and 'Students in Support of Dr George Kenney'. One former student Eric Williams, 20, was the first person Dr Kenney ever hypnotized. He told Good Morning America that his SAT scores 'went up 500 points after the hypnosis'. When asked about her fellow students' deaths, another former pupil Kallie Dremann added: 'They are just trying to pick someone to blame it on.' He has published a number of audio CDs which are sold on Amazon. One uses hypnosis to help defeat anxiety while others focus on sports - baseball pitching and batting along with improving basketball throws. Kenney became a certified hypnotist after attending the Omni Hypnosis Training Centre in Deland, Florida. On the market: Dr George Kenney sells hypnosis audio CDs on Amazon . An investigation had revealed that Wesley McKinley, who had showed no outward sign of depression, got his mother's signed approval to take part in the session with his high school principal. But his parents later said they had a 'ton of questions' and wondered if the hypnosis had played a part in their son's decision to take his own life. According to ABC, private investigators hired by the school district interviewed Kenney, who has been at the Florida school for a decade, over the allegations. The reported stated that the principal said he felt terrible about 'putting his school and his students through something that they didn't need or deserve to have to endure on top of all the tragedy they already have experienced"" and started to cry.","George Kenney given one-year probation for practicing hypnosis without a license .

The hippopotamuses can be seen locking jaws in battle as blood gushes out from their wounds. Hippos are by nature very aggressive and males will often battle each other to mark their territory and claim to female mates. The striking snaps were taken by Tony Dilger in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Face off: A young male, pictured right, challenges an older bull over his territory at Kruger National Park in South Africa . Tussle: The male hippos - which can weigh up to three tonnes - are the . third largest land mammal in the world and are known for their . aggressiveness. Here, the younger male can be seen pushing forward with an explosion of water towards his target . Mr Dilger, from Yorkshire, said: 'The two pink giant hippos met in a head-on collision. It was a spectacle so sudden and violent, it was painful to watch. 'If we thought this would be a lumbering, slow-motion drama we were in for a shock. It was explosive.' Mr Dilger then went on to describe how the two hippos battled for ten minutes until a winner could be decided. He continued: 'For ten minutes, water was thrown high into the air as they surged at each other, their foot-long tusks jabbing into pink flesh, each trying to turn or out-climb the other to deliver a decisive blow. 'The challenger, with slighter build, was more adept and his strategy of gravity-assisted plunge from above seemed to be winning the battle.

Lloyds chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio (pictured with his wife Ana) was handed a £1.49million bonus . Taxpayers are in line to lose £12.4billion on their emergency bailouts of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, it emerged last night. The hidden costs, incurred because Labour paid too much for shares in the banks in 2008, were written off and buried in Budget documents in 2010. But they were unearthed yesterday by Treasury officials as Lloyds indicated it is likely to start offloading the taxpayer’s 39 per cent stake when the bank’s share price, currently 53p, hits 61p. The 61p target is viewed as the ‘break even’ point at which Lloyds shares can be sold without incurring further loss. The ‘break-even’ figure for RBS is around 400p. However, Gordon Brown’s government pumped in £66billion of public money to bail out the two banks and paid over the market value for them to the tune of £12.4billion. This secret write-off came in 2010 a few weeks before the Coalition came to power. The write-off emerged as a fresh £1.5billion charge for mis-selling payment protection insurance prompted Lloyds to post its fifth straight year of huge losses. The bank also came under fire for dishing out a £1.49million bonus to chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio. Lloyds chairman Sir Win Bischoff insisted it was showing ‘restraint’, an echo of Downing Street’s defence of RBS on Wednesday when that bank announced losses of £5billion – and £600million of bonuses for staff. Mr Horta-Osorio said he was ‘confident’ the state-backed lender could be sold back to the private sector at a profit. The £12.4billion write-off covers the £3.6billion on Lloyds and £8.8billion on RBS incurred in the initial bailout. This means taxpayers will in reality break even only if shares in the two banks are sold at the inflated price at which they were bought by Gordon Brown. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It seems increasingly doubtful taxpayers will get back the billions they pumped into these failing institutions.’ Losses at Lloyds, which received a £20billion bailout in 2008, narrowed to £570million last year, down from £3.5billion in 2011. But despite the bank remaining in the red for a fifth year it awarded the bonus in deferred shares to Mr Horta-Osorio. He will only receive the award if the share price hits 73.6p for a sustained period or the Government had sold at least a third of its stake for the lower price of 61p. Lloyds also paid out £365million in bonuses, a 3 per cent drop from last year. Sir Win said the bank ‘continues to show restraint’ but that ‘employees should be rewarded for their contribution to the further strengthening of the business in 2012’. Labour’s John Mann, of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘This is an amazing waste of taxpayers’ money and sends the message we reward failure. It’s the same story – when will we ever learn.’ Insiders insisted the Treasury had never set a target price at which it would start selling shares in Lloyds and RBS.","Once Lloyds shares hit 61p the bank could sell taxpayers' 39 per cent stake .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:55 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:59 EST, 1 March 2013 . The death of a three-year-old Russian boy adopted by a Texas family has been ruled an accident, it was revealed Friday. Ector County Sheriff Mark Donaldson and District Attorney Bobby Bland announced that the medical examiner determined that Max Shatto's death on January 21 was unintentional. Preliminary autopsy results had indicated Max had bruises on several parts of his body, and Bland said Friday that the bruises appeared to be self-inflicted. He also said no drugs were found in Max's system. Autopsy: The medical examiner ruled that the death of Max Shatto was an accident . Accused: Kremlin accused Laura Shatto, right, of beating little Max, left, to death in January . Keeping mum: The driveway to the Shatto family home, rear left, is seen in Gardendale, Texas, with a sign that reads: 'No Comment' ‘I had four doctors agree that this is the result of an accident,’ he said. ‘We have to take that as fact.’ Alan and Laura Shatto adopted Max, . born Maxim Kuzmin, and his half brother, two-year-old Kristopher, from . an orphanage in western Russia this past fall. Laura Shatto told authorities she . found Max unresponsive outside their Gardendale, Texas, home while he . was playing with his younger brother. The boy was pronounced dead a . short time later. The Shatto's attorney, Michael J. Brown, said he agreed ‘with the conclusion that it was an accidental . death and I've been saying it all along.’ ‘This is not a surprise to me at all,’ he said. The investigation into the boy's death . continues, Bland said. Once investigators complete their work, Bland . will meet with them and decide whether to pursue charges such as . negligent supervision or injury to a child by omission. Russian authorities and state-run . media have blamed the Shattos for Max's death and used the case as . justification for a recently enacted ban on all American adoptions of . Russian children. Russia's Investigative Committee has . said it has opened its own investigation. It's unclear whether the . committee could charge the Shatto family or force their prosecution. Alexander K. Zakharov, the Russian . consul general in Houston, said he wanted to see an official report from . authorities before commenting on Friday's announcement. Tragedy: Max Shatto, 3, died last month after being adopted by a family in Texas. Russian authorities are claiming he was abused . Russian born: Maxim was born the town of Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a family in Gardendale, Texas with his family before his death . U.S. State Department officials and adoption agency advocates have called for caution. The Russian government passed the ban . in December in retaliation for a new U.S. law targeting alleged Russian . human-rights violators. The ban also reflects lingering . resentment over the perceived mistreatment of some of the 60,000 . children Americans have adopted during the last two decades. At least 20 . of those children have died, and reports of abuse have garnered . attention in Russia. Chuck Johnson, CEO of the . Virginia-based National Council for Adoption, said an agreement ratified . last year would have prevented the conditions that led to many deaths . and abuse cases. One change in particular would have required all adoptions to go through agencies licensed in Russia. ‘The deaths were terribly tragic, . horrible,’ Johnson said in a February 19 interview. ‘But the frustrating . thing has been that those cases have become the face of inter-country . adoption, and they shouldn't be.’ The Texas Department of Family and . Protective Services said Friday it found no violations at the Gladney . Center for Adoption in Fort Worth, the agency that processed the . Shattos' adoption. The state's Child Protective Services . division is proceeding with a separate investigation into allegations . that Max was subject to physical abuse and neglect, but has not . determined whether those allegations are true. Parents: The boy's adopted parents, Alan and Laura Shatto, denied knowing about the allegations being made by Russian authorities. No arrests have been made . Sad: The little boy, pictured right, was pronounced dead in hospital on Jan. 21 . Russian state media have featured the . boys' biological mother, 23-year-old Yulia Kuzmina, who lost custody . over negligence and addiction to alcohol. In a tightly choreographed February 21 . interview on state television, Kuzmina insisted Russian child services . officials seized her sons without her knowledge and said she wanted to . be reunited with her other son, born Kirill Kuzmin. She said she had given up drinking, . found a job and pledged to fight to get the boy back for fear that if he . stayed with his adoptive Texas family, he too will die like his . brother. . Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has said it is necessary ‘to temper emotions’ over the case. On his part, U.S. Ambassador to Russia . Michael McFaul has called for ‘sensational exploitations of human . tragedy to end and for professional work between our two countries to . grow, on this issue and many others.’ Max's tragic death has received international attention in the wake of a recent Russian ban on all American adoptions. Russia's Investigative Committee said that it had opened an . investigation into the little boy's death. 'Three-year-old Maxim was beaten, . according to the investigators, by his adoptive mother, who fed him . psychoactive drugs over a long period of time, saying that he had some . psychiatric illness,' said Pavel Astakhov, the Russian Children's Rights . Commissioner alleges, according to The Telegraph. Plea: In a tightly choreographed interview, Max's biological mother, 23-year-old Yulia Kuzmina, tearfully appealed to President Putin to have her surviving son returned to her . Accusations: Pavel Astakho has alleged that Maxim was beaten to death by his American mother. American authorities have not confirmed the allegations are still investigating . He said the toddler had numerous bruises on his body and damage to organs. 'Our consuls must be allowed to see the materials of the case and take part in the formulation of the prosecution,' he added. Texas Child Protective Services spokesman Patrick Crimmins confirmed . the agency had received a report on Jan. 21 of the death of a three-year-old . named Max Shatto, and that the Ector County Sheriff's Office in West . Texas was investigating. Crimmins said CPS had received allegations of physical abuse and . neglect, but had not determined whether those allegations were true. An obituary for Max Shatto published Jan. 26 by the Midland . Reporter-Telegram says he was born on Jan. 9, 2010, in the town of . Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a . family in Gardendale, about 350 miles west of Dallas, before his death . on Jan. 21, according to the obituary. On the funeral home's website, .

"By . Graham Smith and Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 11:49 EST, 23 January 2012 . The chief executives of Blackberry maker Research In Motion have both stepped down as the once-iconic firm struggles to survive in an increasingly competitive market. Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis announced last night that they have quit their roles as co-CEOs and co-chairmen at the Canadian company. The development comes a month after RIM delayed the release of new phones deemed critical to the firm's future until late this year. Stepping down: Research In Motion founders and chief executives Jim Balsillie (left) and Mike Lazaridis last night announced their resignation . Its PlayBook tablet, RIM's answer . to the Apple iPad, failed to gain consumer support, forcing the company . to deeply discount it to move the devices off store shelves. RIM has  has lost tens of billions in market value, from a high of $70billion a few years ago to a current market value of $8.9billion. It has been a rapid turnaround - just . three years ago, the firm landed the number one spot on Fortune . magazine's 100 Fastest-Growing Companies. Research in Motion’s first BlackBerry handsets appeared in 1999, and were only available to business users. Starting as two-way pagers, the handsets rapidly added 'push email' - email which arrived as it was sent. This service was nearly unique - other early smartphones tended to only collect email when users pressed a button to do so. BlackBerry became popular with business IT departments because email was secure and easily manageable remotely. The first handsets had black-and-white screens and offered few extras, but the 'always-on' email became an instant hit with business people and BlackBerrys fast became a cult status symbol. Later BlackBerry handsets were more consumer-focused, with the company’s secure – and free – messenger service BBM becoming a hit with teenagers. Consumer handsets included the slim BlackBerry Pearl and an ill-fated touchscreen, Storm – and included Pay-as-you-Go handsets. In 2009, America’s Fortune magazine named RIM as the fastest-growing company on Earth. But the firm’s handsets failed to keep up with the app-heavy approach of rivals iOS and Android, and market share slumped as more versatile iPhone and Android handsets became consumer favourites. BlackBerry’s attempt to enter the tablet market, the Playbook, was crippled by poor design – the tablet required a BlackBerry phone paired via Bluetooth to access email – and was sold at a discount. New BlackBerry handsets such as the Torch felt dated next to Apple and Google devices and a promised new operating system hit delays, with hi-tech new touchscreens promised, but never delivered. Balsillie and Lazaridis have been replaced by Thorsten Heins, a chief operating officer who joined RIM four years ago from Siemens AG. RIM turned the email smartphone into a ubiquitous device that many could not live without. But users have moved on to flashier . touch-screen phones such as Apple's iPhone and various competing models . that run Google's Android software. Many shareholders and analysts have said a change or sale of the company has been needed, but the sudden departure of the two founders was not expected despite their promises that they would examine the co-CEO and co-chairmen structure. Mr Balsillie and Mr Lazaridis have long been celebrated as Canadian heroes, even appearing in the country's citizenship guide for new immigrants as models of success. They headed the Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM together since its inception in 1984. In a statement, Mr Lazaridis said: 'There comes a time in the growth of every successful company when the founders recognise the need to pass the baton to new leadership. 'Jim and I went to the board and told them that we thought that time was now.' Mr Lazaridis will take on a new role as vice chairman of RIM's board and chairman of the board's new innovation committee, while Mr Balsillie remains a member of the board. Both remain two of RIM's biggest shareholders. Mr Balsillie said: 'I agree this is the right time to pass the baton to new leadership, and I have complete confidence in Thorsten, the management team and the company. 'I remain a significant shareholder and a director and, of course, they will have my full support.' Analysts have said RIM's future depends on its much-delayed new software platform as RIM has tried and failed to reinvigorate the BlackBerry. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said in late 2010 that RIM would have a hard time catching up to Apple because it has been forced to move beyond its area of strength and into unfamiliar territory of trying to become a software platform company. Mr Heins, 54, said his predecessor took RIM in the right direction and that he is committed to the new software. He said: 'We are more confident than ever that was the right path. 'It is Mike and Jim's continued unwillingness to sacrifice long-term value for short-term gain which has made RIM the great company that it is today. 'I share that philosophy and am very excited about the company's future.' Successor: Thorsten Heins will now take over the reins after joining RIM four years ago from Siemens AG . Headquarters: Research In Motion is based in Waterloo, Ontario . Barbara Stymiest, a former chief operating officer of the Royal Bank of Canada who has been a member of RIM's board since 2007, has named chair of the board of directors. RIM also announced that Prem Watsa, the chief executive of Fairfax Financial Holdings, is a new board member. Mr Watsa has become a significant shareholder. Mr Lazaridis said he was so confident in the future direction of the company that he intends to purchase an additional $50million of the company's shares on the open market. RIM was worth more than $70billion a few years ago but now has a market value of $8.9billion. The company still has 75million active subscribers, but many analysts believe RIM will lose market share internationally as it has in the U.S. Market researcher NPD Group said RIM's market share of smartphones in the U.S. declined from 44 per cent in 2009 to 10 per cent in 2011. Mr Balsillie acknowledged in December that the last few quarters have been among the most challenging times in the company's history.","Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis quit as Research In Motion chief executives 28 years after founding the firm .

The . incident was revealed after a probe into UCCs, which are earmarked to . replace A&E units, found they are inadequately staffed, with some . personnel not qualified to prescribe drugs. Health officials are keen to roll out . the clinics in order to free up space in over-crowded casualty units. In many hospitals, a UCC acts as the first port of . call for patients, who are then referred to the A&E next door if . necessary. But there are serious concerns the units are not up to the job - and could actually increase strain on the NHS. In London, five major A&Es have . been downgraded to become UCCs staffed by GPs and nurses but with no . emergency care consultants. The downgraded departments will be . prevented from treating a huge array of life-threatening illnesses, such . as shock, internal bleeding, most broken bones, breathing problems, . heart attacks and strokes. Linzi Bakan and her husband Apo were left furious when the Urgent Care Centre in Darlington wouldn't treat little Apo . There has been huge opposition from . doctors and patients during a public consultation period, and . campaigners argue that residents in some of the most deprived areas of . the capital will be put at risk. The Primary Care Foundation report, written by GPs, NHS managers and consultants, examined 15 undisclosed UCCs across England. It . said: ‘The availability of particular types of service often varied by . time of day. Sometimes, this was planned (so X-ray facilities might be . available for only part of the opening hours, or GPs might be available . for part of the time only). ‘This . variability increases the  risk that a patient may attend for a . condition that cannot be treated by the service, increasing delay and . clinical risk.’ Some UCCs . offered a full range of services and skilled staff that was nearly the . same as a fully functioning A&E. But others were little more than . walk-in centres that could treat only the simplest cases seen in GP . surgeries. Some centres offered ‘nurse only’ services with no doctors on . duty, which meant that the type of patient who could be seen and . treated depended on the qualifications of the nurse on duty. The . report concluded UCCs should be able to treat or refer all patients who . attended and that there should be no unnecessary delay. It . has called on NHS chiefs to ‘make sure that the advertised services are . available consistently over time and not subject to variation depending . on who is on duty’ in order to protect patients.","Apo Bakan, two, suffered injury in clinic while waiting to be seen by doctor .

If so, for one Dartmoor pony grazing 300ft above Rame Head in Cornwall, it was a munch too far. After slithering 230ft, she was left stranded on a ledge for four days before a 40-strong team of professionals saved her from a  lingering death. The alarm was raised by RSPCA inspector Peter Ferris after local residents reported the pony’s plight. What a donkey! Somehow, the pony managed to tumble over a 300ft cliff at Rame Head, East Cornwall . This lasso's never going to work: The Dartmoor pony slithered down 230ft before coming to a stop on a ledge . Easy does it: Amazing, she survived and remained stuck there for four days until a fireman was lowered on ropes to help her . Com back here! The fireman coaxed her safely on to the beach and then had to carefully usher her across the sand towards fellow rescuers . Then in came coastguards, firemen specialising in mineshaft rescues, the RSPCA’s own rescue team, a crew from Plymouth-based 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines and a vet armed with a tranquilliser dart powerful enough to knock out a rhino. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service group manager Martin Wingrove, who led the operation, said: ‘The pony was none the worse afterwards although she quickly downed a bucket of water. ‘The real mystery is how on earth she managed to get down so far and survive. ‘It was as if she had been plucked off the clifftop and placed there.’ Saving Private Pony: As the beach was accessible only by sea, a crew from Plymouth-based 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines, who were on a routine training exercise, stepped in to help . All aboard! The rescue operation ferried in vet Sam Pawson who fired a tranquiliser dart at the animal. The sedated pony was strapped to a raft, which was floated out to a landing craft and dragged aboard . Steady ass she goes: Mission accomplished, the landing craft - accompanied by a Marines sail boat - carefully sets sail from the beach. A Marines spokesman commended rescuers 'deftness and flexibility'. Not surprisingly, he admitted 'there is no standard procedure for this activity'. Hitting the hay: Back on dry land, the pony sleeps off the effects of the tranquiliser. RSPCA inspector Peter Ferris says she has been named Marina in honour of the Marines . Stable condition: Back on her hooves and feeling her old self again, the mare is visited by Mr Ferris. 'Now all I've got do is find her owner,' he said. 'If no one comes forward, I might adopt her myself.'","Rescue operation for pony who slithered 230ft down a cliff in Cornwall .

Tragic: Dr. Victoria Vovchik stabbed her seven-year-old daughter before killing herself at their home . A doctor has killed herself after stabbing her seven-year-old daughter 31 times - leaving the girl's father to find the grisly scene. Victoria Vovchik, 45, was found dead in her master bedroom in New City, New York on Thursday afternoon, with her daughter, Ava Sangavaram, lying nearby. Officials said the young girl had been stabbed 31 times, including across the throat, and was rushed to Westchester Medical Center, where she is listed in critical condition. She has undergone surgery and is expected to survive. The bloody scene was discovered by Ava's father, Dr. Kristappa Sangavaram, when he visited the home. He called 911 and police arrived at the upscale home just after 1 p.m. Dr Sangavaram, 68, did not live with Vovchik and their daughter, but co-owned the home. He had been married to a different woman for several decades until her death last year, his son Preeth Sangavaram, told The Journal News. The elder Sangavaram and Vovchik had never married but remained friends and shared care of Ava. 'It’s a touchy situation because he had a . child with her (Vovchik) but wasn't married to her,' Preeth Sangavaram, . 29, told The Journal News. 'The child was very important to him, so he . always tried to maintain a healthy relationship.' Sangavaram called police on Thursday to report a possible suicide, police said. Scene: Her body was found next to her daughter at their home in New City, New Jersey on Thursday . Tragic: Vovchik's body is carried away by coroners but her daughter survived and is in critical condition . 'I believe he came home and . discovered them,' Clarkstown Sgt. Jo Anne Fratianni said during . a news conference. 'She (Ava) was conscious, I believe.' Sangavaram was brought in for questioning by Clarkstown police, but was later released. They do not believe he played any role in the tragedy, the Journal News reported. Police said Vovchik left behind no note explaining why she attacked her daughter or took her own life. She used a knife or other sharp object to kill herself, officers said. Sangavaram spoke briefly of his daughter when reached by The Journal News on Thursday night. 'She's doing fine,' he said. 'She's OK. I cannot say more.' Ray Florida, executive director of Rockland Paramedic Services, said Ava was able to speak when she was being treated by medics at the scene. Discovery: They were found by the girl's father, who co-owned the house with Vovchik . Investigation: She left no note explaining why she attacked her daughter or took her life, police said . She has now undergone surgery and has been taken to the Intensive Care Unit. Police said it was unlikely she would be able to speak with them about the incident for several days. Vovchik was a podiatrist with practices in Fort Lee and Montvale, New Jersey. Sangavaram, who lives in Englewood Cliffs, is an anesthesiologist educated in India. But he briefly lost his medical license after pleading no contest to charges of charging excessive fees and improperly treating a patient in 2004, records show. He was also ordered to pay $210,000. With Vovchik, he bought the home in August 2010 for $810,000. They put down $300,000 and took out a mortgage. Fratianni added that police had never been called to the home for any type of domestic issue.","Victoria Vovchik found stabbed to death in her home next to her daughter .

Collectors of the popular figurines had snapped up 'Blind Bags' containing two hidden monsters for £2, or four, plus a hidden character for £5, in the hope of collecting each of the Series Five 'Moshlings' after they were released in January. They trawled toyshops, newsagents and the internet for the the jellyfish-like creature with big red googly eyes, described as the 'owner of the Gross-ery Store' - but to no avail. The toys are aimed at children aged between six and 14 and are based on characters from an online game where youngsters can care for and nurture monsters as pets.

A baby who was found dumped in the street in a Walmart plastic bag last week has now been released from hospital, as authorities continue to search for her family. The newborn, named Chloe by hospital staff in Houston, Texas, is now a week old and even has her first tooth - which she showed off to photographers as she smiled for cameras on Monday. She was found outside an apartment complex on Tuesday last week after a woman's dog picked up on a scent and led her to a bag, where she made the startling discovery. Scroll down to watch video . Bundle of joy: Baby Chloe smiles a week after she was found dumped in a plastic bag in Houston . Paramedics took the young girl, who still had about three inches of umbilical court attacked to her stomach, to Texas Children's Hospital, where she was listed as in good condition. 'She was very healthy… didn't have a fever,' Estella Olguin with the Child Protective Services told KHOU. 'Fortunately, she did not suffer from being exposed to the elements . that evening.' Doctors believe the young girl was dumped just hours after she was born. They also think she was born slightly premature at 35 weeks gestation. CPS is now looking for the girl's mother or father; Olguin said they do not have to claim the baby but that a discussion with them would be useful to identify Chloe's family's medical history. Abandoned: Child Protective Services is now looking for her parents so they know her medical history . Content: The newborn has been placed in foster care and a judge will decide her future next week . 'So the person who is adopting this baby can have some more genetic . family medical background on the baby to be able to raise her with more . knowledge or information about her,' Olguin said. Chloe will be cared for in a foster home as CPS continues the search. A hearing will be held on her behalf on March 4, and a judge will decide her fate, the Houston Chronicle reported. Her early tooth is a genetic trait and could be a clue to tracking down the family, doctors said. Sgt Gordon Trott, of the Harris County Sheriff’s Office, said an unnamed woman walking her pet at around 7pm came across a Walmart bag left near the fence surrounding the Stonegate Villas Apartments in the 11000 block of Grant Road in the Cypress section of Houston, according to the Houston Chronicle. Rough start: A newborn baby girl, seen in the circle inside the ambulance, was discovered alive inside a plastic bag left outside a housing complex in Houston . According to Trott, the woman's dog . picked up a scent and led her to the bag. At first, the pet owner . thought that someone had dumped a dead animal, but when she opened the . parcel, she was surprised to find a little girl inside. According to officials, the child was . naked, but her body temperature was normal, suggesting that she had not . been outside for a long time. Her umbilical cord had not been clamped, but someone made sure to clean her up after birth. Officials with the Harris County . Sheriff's Office Crimes Against Children Unit said they have few leads . since there are no surveillance cameras in the area where the newborn . was abandoned. 'If it had not of been for the . resident that came out to walk her dogs, that child may have laid there . all night, possibly would've died,' said Trott. Drop-off spot: The child was wrapped in a Walmart bag that was placed between a tree and a bush on Grant Road . Lucky break: The newborn girl was breathing on her own and listed in good condition after being taken to a hospital for evaluation . Law enforcement officials were taken aback by the mother's decision to dump the newborn on the street since Texas has a Safe Haven law which allows anyone to drop off a child at a hospital or fire station without facing any legal repercussions, Click2Houston reported. Endangering or abandoning a child is a third degree felony in Texas and punishable by two to ten years in prison. If the mother is a juvenile, she could still face repercussions in the juvenile courts. But if the biological parents come forward in this case, investigators from the Harris County Sheriff's Department will try to determine the circumstances leading to the abandonment and then discuss the case with the District Attorney's Office, a sheriff's department spokesperson said.

But new research suggests that nearly half wait just six weeks after giving birth to rekindle the romance. Australian researchers found that 41 per cent tried sex within six weeks of giving birth. By 12 weeks, this had risen to 78 per cent and 94 pent by the six-month mark. Nearly half of first-time mothers wait just six weeks after giving birth to have sex again . Older mothers and those who had undergone Caesarean sections took longer to get their sex lives back on track. Those who had sex within six weeks of birth were less likely to have undergone surgery or a forceps delivery or suffered an injury such as a cut or a tear during birth. Forty five per cent of women who had a Caesarean section, and 32 per cent of women who had a forceps-assisted birth resumed sex within six week, compared with 60 per cent who had a normal vaginal delivery. However, the paper also states that only . about 10 per cent of women having a first baby will achieve a vaginal . birth without intervention, tear or cut. The proportion of women having sex . within six weeks of childbirth is also lower among older mothers; 40 per cent of 30 to 34-year-olds resumed sex . within six weeks, compared to 63 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds. The research, which was carried out . by the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, in Victoria, Australia, . also found that sexual activity was resumed earlier than vaginal sex – . 53 per cent of new mothers resumed some sexual activity within six weeks . of giving birth. Those who had sex within six weeks of birth were less likely to have undergone surgery or a forceps delivery . The study was published in the leading journal BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The NHS does not give a recommended . waiting time after birth – it suggests that new parents take their time . and wait until they feel comfortable resuming penetrative sex. Lead study author, Associate . Professor Stephanie Brown, said: ‘The most important . finding from the study is the wide time interval over which couples . resume sex after childbirth. ‘Most couples do not resume sex until after 6 to 8 weeks postpartum, and many delay much longer than this. ‘This . is useful information for couples to know before their baby is born, . and may help reduce feelings of anxiety and guilt about not resuming . sexual activity sooner.’ John Thorp, BJOG Deputy Editor in Chief said: ‘It is very common for women and their partners to want information about when sexual activity may be safely and comfortably resumed, and what to expect in relation to the impact of childbirth on their relationship. ‘Having reliable information to guide clinical practice can dispel common myths about what is normal during the postnatal period as well as enabling clinicians to tailor information to a woman’s individual circumstances. ‘This study provides important new evidence to guide information given to women and their partners about what to expect after childbirth. However, it is important to remember that these decisions are down to the individual couple and when it feels right for them.' However, the National Childbirth Trust recommends that new mothers do not have sex until their post-birth bleeding stops because they otherwise risk infection.","41 per cent of women try sex within six weeks of birth .

Charles Dickens's classic novel A Christmas Carol is the book that parents want their children to read more than any other. Other selections that would please mothers and fathers were JK Rowling's Harry Potter books and JRR Tolkien's timeless The Lord of the Rings trilogy, a survey by the University of Worcester revealed. One in five parents and guardians would be happiest if their child chose to read Dickens's Victorian tale, with the more modern series following in second and third places. Influential: The famous work by the 19th century English novelist is still considered a valuable read for children . Iconic romance novelist Jane Austen came next with Pride and Prejudice, followed by Lewis Carroll’s fantasy adventure Alice in Wonderland and political satire Animal Farm by George Orwell. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien, which is being released as a Hollywood blockbuster later this year, comes ninth and another political story - To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee - is tenth. Anne Hannaford, Director of Information and Learning Services at the university, said: 'It is interesting to see that most of the popular books to pass down the generations have strong moral messages entwined in them. 'The books that feature in the top 10 all provide thought-provoking content and characters, so it is clear that parents value these books for providing challenging thoughts which can last a lifetime.' Spooked: A vignette from A Christmas Carol, when memorable character Ebenezer Scrooge meets Marley's ghost . The survey took place to mark the opening of The Hive in Worcester - Europe’s first joint university and public library. Ms Hannaford added: 'It . is great to see that parents want to share their love of reading and . their favourite books with their children and we see this every day at . The Hive with parents reading with their children in the library.' Alice in Wonderland is the country's most-read book, with 41 per cent of the 2,000 adults surveyed having read it. 1. A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens 2. The Harry Potter series, JK Rowling 3. The Lord of The Rings trilogy, JRR Tolkien 4. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen 5. Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll 6. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, CS Lewis  7. Animal Farm, George Orwell 8. Oliver Twist, Charles Dickens 9. The Hobbit, JRR Tolkien 10. To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee . More than a third have read CS Lewis’ iconic The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, Kenneth Greene’s much-loved The Wind in The Willows and Roald Dahl’s whimsical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The survey also revealed that one in five 18 - 24 year olds would pretend to have read a book to impress someone and that 35-44-year-olds are the most avid library visitors - nearly half say they visit the library. More than half percent of adults said they missed reading, with a third admitting they have not read a book in ages. One in five adults are unsure of where to look for a good book and believe they would read more if they knew which they would enjoy - 27 per cent of adults therefore choose a book by its cover. Ms Hannaford said: 'Time is so precious nowadays that many people don’t have the luxury to read as much as they used to, therefore making the right decision on what to read is more important than ever.

A Connecticut grandmother who allegedly shot and killed her two young grandchildren before shooting herself also suffered from mental health problems, it was revealed today. The body of 47-year-old Debra Denison was discovered alongside her grandchildren, brothers Ashton, six months, and two-year-old Alton Perry late last night. She was supposed to be taking them to their mother's for Alton's birthday party. Denison's daughter, Brenda Perry, wrote on her Facebook page early today: 'Thank you for your prayers... My boys are in an amazing place, we've got a few great angels watching over us,' adding that 'my mom was sick.' Earlier Tuesday, Denison had picked up the brothers from their daycare in Danielson and was supposed to take them to Alton's birthday party, where family members were waiting to celebrate. Debra Denison is believed to have shot to death her two-year-old and six-month-old grandchildren before turning the gun on herself. Here she is pictured with Alton, who was found dead in the car alongside his little brother Ashton and his grandmother . Victims: Ashton (left) and Alton (right) Perry were found dead in a minivan at Lake of Isle in Preston, Connecticut yesterday. It was Alton's second birthday . Family members said that the boys’ maternal grandmother suffered from several mental health issues including depression, while other family members said she had bipolar disorder and split personalities. Those who saw the grandmother at the daycare said she was friendly and talkative when she picked up her grandchildren, and added that she didn’t give any indication of something wrong, according to Nikki Salaun, director of the Kidds & Co. daycare center in North Stonington. Ms Salaun and daycare center co-owner Christine Hare said the boys' mother worked at the daycare center herself a couple years and had mentioned that the grandmother had a history of mental health troubles. Scene: A picture from today shows the state boat launch at the end of Lake of Isles Road in Preston, Connecticut where state police say the three bodies were found . Brothers: Alton Perry, left, and Ashton Perry, 6 months old, right, were taken from their daycare by their grandmother Tuesday afternoon; today was Alton's second birthday . They said they keep going over the pickup in their minds but there is nothing they could have done differently. 'Brenda obviously put her on the list thinking she would be okay,' Ms Hare told the Associated Press. 'We go with the parents. We can't override their wishes. Obviously if she had come here obviously distraught, we would have intervened.' Police are officially calling this a murder-suicide after finding a suicide note left by Denison. In her note, she said in part that God was watching over her own 13-year-old son, who was not hurt in Tuesday’s tragic events. However, the motive for the murder-suicide remains under investigation. The family knew something was wrong yesterday afternoon, and called state police at around 4pm after Denison and the boys failed to show up for the party. An Amber Alert was issued for Ashton and Alton. In the Amber Alert, state police said Denison is 'bipolar and has medical conditions'. Bipolar disorder (formerly known as manic depression) is a mental condition that causes mood swings between overactive, excited behaviour known as mania to deep depression. There are often periods of stability between these highs and lows. However, some people also hallucinate or have delusions. It can also cause suicidal thoughts. State police troopers and detectives were called in to aid in the investigation, and area police agencies were notified and given the descriptions of Denison and the children. Brenda, the mother of the pair, posted: ''God has two beautiful angels helping him now' Facebook pictures of the boys' parents Jeremy and Brenda Perry with Alton when he was much younger . At about 9.30pm, police received a . report of a suspicious vehicle parked near the Lake of Isles golf course . with three injured people inside, two of whom appeared to be children. The two boys and their grandmother were pronounced dead at the scene. Mother Brenda Perry, married to father Jeremy since October 2010, posted  'God has two beautiful angels helping him now', after the Amber Alert was called off. She today posted on Facebook: 'Thank you for the prayers. I ask for you to also pray for my brother and sister. They lost three people last night.

Officers also confirmed that Denison, picked up the baby and toddler and drove off with the children and the gun in a 2002 White Chrysler Town & Country minivan with a CT registration of 445-ZAZ. State police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance told the New Haven Register: 'The car was found about 9.30pm. 'The woman and the two kids are both dead.' Denison suffered from bipolar disorder and has a history of mental issues, according to family members gathered at the boys' parents home. Denison left the family a note, but they did not reveal the contents. It is now in the hands of officers. Connecticut State Police issued an Amber Alert when the family grew concerned. Officers were alerted to their bodies later in the evening . Investigation: Police cars blocked off Lake of Isles Road, where the car and bodies were found . According to the Connecticut Judiciary website, Denison has a criminal . conviction for reckless driving from 2003, but no other convictions. Last night, state police blocked the entrance to Lake of Isles Road, and the Eastern District Major Crime Squad responded to the scene to investigate. An autopsy will be performed by the Chief States medical examiner to determine the manner and cause of death today. Denison is believed to have shot her two grandchildren with a .38 pistol.

Being less sedentary all the time could be more beneficial than going to the gym, claim scientists . Forget the gym – getting up from your desk to chat to a colleague a few times a day may be all that is required to prevent Type 2 diabetes. New research suggests people at high risk of developing diabetes may be able to escape the condition by cutting the time they spending sitting down by 90 minutes every day. Consequently, official advice recommending 150 minutes of physical activity each week should be amended to encourage people to be less sedentary all the time, say studies from Leicester University. They found important risk factors for Type 2 diabetes, such as blood glucose and cholesterol levels, improved far more in people told to sit less, compared with those doing required amounts of exercise. Research leader Joseph Henson said: ‘These studies provide preliminary evidence that sedentary behaviour may be a more effective way to target the prevention of Type 2 diabetes, rather than just solely focusing on physical activity. ‘Moreover, sedentary time occupies large portions of the day, unlike moderate to vigorous physical activity.’ Type 2 diabetes mostly affects middle-aged people and occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar, leading to high levels which can damage body organs and years of ill-health. It is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet. Patients from two studies on activity levels and diabetes were investigated by a team from the Diabetes Research Unit at Leicester University. The patients, who were at high risk of developing diabetes, ranged in age from early 30s to late 60s. The team examined the extent to which sedentary time, breaks in sedentary time, vigorous exercise and total physical activity were linked with cardiometabolic risk factors in a population with known risk factors for Type 2 diabetes. These include blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Those who spent longer sitting down had risk factors that were 'detrimentally' linked to diabetes . They found those who spent longer periods of time sitting had risk factors that were ‘detrimentally’ linked to diabetes whatever their age. Sedentary time had stronger links with negative scores than improvements brought about by vigorous exercise, says a report in Diabetologia (The journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes). Mr Henson said the research suggested that cutting sitting time by 90 minutes a day would significantly help people at risk. ‘Along with messages related to accumulating at least 150 min per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity, which form the cornerstone of diabetes prevention programmes, such interventions may be more effective still if individuals are further encouraged to simply sit less and move more, regardless of the intensity level,’ he added. There is growing evidence which suggests too much sitting - as opposed to insufficient activity - may be a new risk factor for premature death and illness. The study comes after US research showing office workers who sit for more than four hours a day are at greater risk of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. It found those sitting for at least six hours were significantly more likely to have diabetes. Dr Matthew Hobbs, Head of Research at Diabetes UK, said: ‘This study adds to the extensive evidence that spending a lot of time sitting or lying down is linked to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and that being more physically active can help to reduce this risk. ‘The suggestion that time spent sitting or lying down may be a more important indicator of poor health than a lack of moderate or vigorous exercise is interesting. However, this is not yet confirmed and must be proven with further research. ‘What is clear is that anyone who spends a lot of time sitting or lying down could benefit from spending more time being physically active, regardless of the type of activity involved. ‘Finding activities that you enjoy and can incorporate into your daily life, such as walking, gardening, DIY or housework, is the best way to achieve this.’","Cutting the time people spend sitting down by 90 minutes a day could reduce Type 2 diabetes risk .

So spare a thought for Sarah Chiad, who carried two of them. Her daughter and son, Hannah and Thomas, had a combined weight of 17lb 8oz, almost double the average for twins. Twintastic: Hannah, left, and Thomas, right, are the new siblings of Christopher, nine and five-year-old Rebekah . Double troube: Sara Chiad with her healthy babies, Hannah and Thomas, whose combined weight at birth was 18lbs . Hannah weighed 8lb 13oz and Thomas 8lb 11oz when they were born by caesarean section on January 11. It means they are among the largest pairs of mixed-sex twins ever born in the UK. Mrs Chiad had watched her waist grow to 57 inches during her pregnancy so she knew her babies would be big – just not that big. But for the 38-year-old, all that . matters is that the twins are healthy. She and her husband, Thomas, had . endured three miscarriages in the past, including the loss of another . set of twins. She suffers from a rare blood-clotting . disorder called Hughes syndrome or ‘sticky blood,’ which is one of the . biggest causes of recurrent miscarriage. Clots form in the placenta, . causing the pregnancy to fail. Sibling love: Sarah, 38, had an inkling the twins she was expecting might be bigger than normal when her bump measured a whopping 57 inches . When Mrs Chiad became pregnant for the . first time she was expecting twins, but that pregnancy ended in a . heartbreaking miscarriage. She was still oblivious to the blood . problem when she later gave birth to 6lb 12oz Christopher, who is now . nine. She said: ‘When he was delivered the placenta was full of clots . and it was a miracle he survived.’ Mrs Chiad and her husband, a . 41-year-old electronics engineer, tried for more children and two more . miscarriages followed. She was not given any tests in the UK, . but when the family spent a period living in Austria she told a local . doctor about her history and Hughes syndrome was ‘diagnosed straight . away’. The miscarriage risk is easily treated . with blood-thinning drugs and as a result Rebekah was born, weighing . 9lb 3oz. She is now five. The world's heaviest pair of twins weighed a total of 27lbs 12oz and were born to Mary Ann Ward Haskin on 20 February 1924 in Arkansas, USA - Patricia Jane weighed 14lbs and John Prosser weighed 13lbs 2oz. Patricia Jane is the heaviest twin ever born. The world's lightest surviving twins, weighing a total of 1lb 8.5oz, were Courtney (12oz) and Chloe (12.5oz) Smith, born in Louisiana, USA, on 1 March 2000 . The twins born furthest apart were Timothy and Celeste Keys, born 95 days apart on 15 October 1993 and 18 January 199, in Louisiana, USA . Mixed set: Sarah's two older children said they were hoping for a brother and a sister, so they were happy with Hannah and Thomas . After slimming down to 15 stone from . 21 stone, Mrs Chiad then decided to try for a third baby. She said: ‘We . ended up with two instead of one. It was a shock but a nice surprise.’ She found out she was expecting twins at a seven-week scan, and was . again given medication to prevent her blood clotting. The pregnancy went without a hitch and the twins were born at 37 weeks. ‘When I saw them for the first time they were big but normal babies. I didn’t realise they were anything unusual,’ she said. The average twin is around 5lb so staff at Chesterfield Royal Hospital were stunned when they weighed Hannah and Thomas. The UK record for mixed-sex twins is a . combined 18lb 12oz and Mrs Chiad believes she would have broken it had . she gone to full term. ‘I knew they were going to be big but didn’t . expect this,’ she said. ‘My health visitor said in 20 years she has . never known such big twins.’ The babies, now five weeks old, are . flourishing at home in Hasland, Derbyshire under the careful eye of . their parents and older siblings. Mrs Chiad said: ‘Rebekah and Christopher wanted one of each so they were delighted when they found out.’ Sarah said: 'They are getting on very well and are good babies.

'Which is probably another reason why I'd love to be out in the PBs [patrol bases], away from it all. 'But yeah, it's completely normal. It's as normal as it's going to get. I'm one of the guys. I don't get treated any differently.' Day job: Harry, pictured on December 12, was flying Apache helicopters in Helmand province . In the cockpit: The prince pictured relaxing while at the controls of his helicopter on October 31 . Harry was accompanied by officers from SO14, the Metropolitan Police Royal Protection Branch, at all times when he was at the base. However, in Afghanistan his security detail was smaller than usual, and they did not accompany him when he flew on missions 'outside the wire'. After leaving the country on a regular personnel aircraft last night, the prince was taken to an undisclosed location for a 24-hour 'decompression' period alongside other troops. The decompression usually takes place in Cyprus. Soldiers are said to be given four cans of lager each and are allowed to relax on the beaches as they prepare to return to the UK. It was revealed yesterday that Harry had killed Taliban militants during his deployment in Afghanistan, as he opened up about topics such as the naked pictures of him in a Las Vegas hotel room and the news that he is to become an uncle. The prince's closest friends at the camp were the other crew members on the two aircraft he flew. While on duty waiting for call-outs they played the military board-game Uckers, watched films, played computer games and chatted. 'One of the guys': Harry, pictured on November 1, paid tribute to his comrades for treating him normally . Concentration: Harry attending a mission briefing at Camp Bastion on October 31 . Captain Simon Beattie, the commander of Harry’s flight of four men, is also a co-pilot gunner and has known the prince for over a year. 'It's easy to put aside the fact he's the third in line to the throne,' the 30-year-old from Bath said. 'He's a normal guy. 'He's someone I consider a friend and someone I enjoy working with, so it's not something you notice.' He added that soldiers were not shy about joking around with the prince, saying that 'he's pretty forward on the banter as well'. Mr Beattie added: 'It's just part of us all being together. If you put a group of guys together anywhere, take the beers out of the equation, you still get the fun and the messing around that happens.' Sergeant James John, another pilot in 662 Sqn, said: 'Captain Wales is just another member of the squadron and another member of our flight, and we all work together, the same as we would with anyone else that comes in and out of the crews, so it's a situation-no-change.' The 27-year-old from Bridgend in south Wales revealed Harry's closest colleagues are protective of him and try to help him lead an ordinary life. 'It's important to have a normal job, I imagine, in such a high-profile place,' he said. 'It's nice to be able to just get on and do your job, which is what everyone tries to give him while he's here, and he's finding it great.' Chain of command: Despite his royal status, Harry was subordinate to a number of other officers . Comrade: Corporal Graham Carr was responsible for re-arming Harry's helicopter in the middle of missions . Harry's squadron commander, Major Ali Mack, likened his unit to a 'family', and said the royal settled in quickly when he arrived in September last year. 'He is, as far as I’m concerned, given no special treatment,' the 37-year-old from Glasgow said. 'I treat him very much as I do the rest of my officers within the squadron.' Corporal Graham Carr, who was responsible for re-arming the prince's helicopter, spoke about the strange experience of finding himself in charge of a Royal. 'He might be third in line to the throne, but that’s how it works out here,' the 28-year-old said. 'Harry comes through the gates - all the aircrew’s kit is stored in our shack, so they come in there. We see them every day. He’s a good laugh, good banter. 'Sometimes after they’ve got down, they’ve got time to sit and chat and have a brew. To be honest, it’s just normal stuff. Football, the UK, what you’re missing and that sort of stuff.' However, Mr Carr admitted he would never forget his time in close quarters with Prince Harry. 'It’s certainly an honour, and it’s something that I’ll tell the kids about, and the grandkids, in the future,' he said. After it was announced yesterday that Harry was heading home from Afghanistan, Twitter lit up with messages about the prince within minutes. @SPWhittaker73 wrote: 'Go Prince Harry! Knows how to party hard in Vegas... and what to do when faced against the Taliban. Harry 1 - Taliban 0 #shoots&scores.' That sentiment was echoed by @JLock4820, who wrote: 'So I guess Prince Harry is the real life 007.'","Royal pictured wiping tabletops at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan .

Possessive: John Yates has been found guilty of killing his wife and driving her body to a police base where he handed himself in . A violent and jealous man who killed his estranged wife before driving her body in the boot of his car to a police traffic base has been found guilty of her murder. Barbara Yates, a 49-year-old mother-of-two, was looking forward to her 50th birthday when she was killed by John Yates, 58, of Padgate, Warrington. The violence and abuse Mr Yates showed towards his wife went back 30 years, Caernarfon Crown Court in North Wales heard. According to prosecuting barrister Wyn Lloyd Jones, Mrs Yates had told her sister that her husband had once locked her in a cupboard. In 1987, she was admitted to hospital after he allegedly punched her repeatedly, tried to strangle her and banged her head on a car dashboard. But in 2009, Mrs Yates decided she couldn't take anymore and finally left her abusive husband. But he was jealous of her new life. In 2011 she was taken to hospital after a 'prolonged assault' by him. At one stage he allegedly got a hammer and hit her over the head. Mrs Yates, a taxi escort for disabled children, had also described how her husband went berserk after being refused sex. But she withdrew a complaint against him. Seven months later, on July 18, she was killed. Controlling and possessive Yates told the jury how he headbutted, strangled, punched and stamped on Mrs Yates in the Warrington area. It is still not known exactly where she died. 'I don't know the sequence of events, I lost my head.' he said. He disputed touching her in an intimate area during the attack and insisted he didn't kill his wife, who was a parent governor at a special school, because she wanted a divorce. Torture: Barbara Yates was tormented for 30 years by her violent husband . Following the killing he drove her body in the boot of his Peugeot 306 estate to a police traffic base 45 miles away at St Asaph where he handed himself in. The cause of death was severe blunt force head, face and neck injuries. A hand may have been put over her mouth during the attack. Yates had been on police bail following an incident 13 days earlier when he stole 35 pairs of shoes and a new dress from her home. Grim: John Yates drove his wife's body to a police traffic base 45 miles away in St Asaph . Guilty: Yates had admitted the manslaughter of his wife but a jury took just two hours to find him guilty of her murder before he drove her body to a police base . Judge Merfyn Hughes QC told Yates: 'You have been convicted on overwhelming evidence of the murder of Barbara Yates your wife and partner of over 30 years. 'You have denied her murder but admitted her killing. There is only one sentence that I can pass which will be of life imprisonment.' The minimum term will be determined at a sentencing hearing next month. Yates had admitted the manslaughter of his wife but a jury took just two hours to find him guilty of her murder which he denied. Speaking outside court Cathryn Huddlestone, who had the grim task of identifying her sister's body, said: 'He is a brutal, brutal animal. He shouldn't be free to roam after what he did to my sister. 'I can't believe he could have that much anger and jealousy. If he loved her he should have let her get along with her life.' Another sister, Angela Hyland, said : 'He controlled her and abused her mentally and physically and tried to get rid of her body like garbage. 'Barbara wanted a life of her own but he wouldn't allow it. He was a controlling monster.'","Barbara Yates was looking forward to her 50th birthday when she was killed .

Oscar Pistorius' representatives have said the substance found in his bedroom after his girlfriend was shot dead was Testis compositum - a herbal remedy used to aid muscle recovery. South African police said during the athlete's bail hearing that they found needles in his bedroom along with the substance which they initially named as testosterone. Prosecutors later withdrew their statement saying the substance had been sent for laboratory tests and that they would not be able to name it until tests had been completed. Lawyers for Oscar Pistorius have said the substance found in his bedroom was a herbal remedy to aid muscle recovery . According to Pistorius' family spokesman, Lunice Johnston, the athlete's lawyers have confirmed that the substance is Testis compositum. The product is also marketed as a sexual enhancer which can improve stamina. Some online retailers advertise oral and injectable forms as testosterone boosters and say it can aid sexual performance. In court last week, Pistorius' defence lawyer Barry Roux said the substance was not banned by sports authorities, but it had been unclear what it was and what the exact name was. The product called Testis compositum is made by Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH, based in Baden-Baden, Germany. Vigil: Oscar Pistorius (right) and his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp (left) together in Johannesburg, South Africa, on February 7. The athlete was due to hold a private memorial service to her . The company website says it is one of the world's leading makers of homeopathic combination medications. A U.S. subsidiary, Heel USA Inc., markets the product in tablet form only and spokeswoman Joan Sullivan said she didn't know if injectable versions are sold in other countries. The product is also marketed as a sexual enhancer which can improve stamina . Heel U.S. website says the product provides temporary relief for men's 'sexual weakness' and lack of stamina. The tablets sold in the U.S. contain 23 ingredients, including pig testicles, pig heart, pig embryo and pig adrenal gland, cortisone, ginseng and other botanicals. It also contains several minerals, according to a list Ms Sullivan provided. Charles Yesalis, a professor and expert on steroid use in sports, said animal steroids wouldn't likely have an athletic performance-enhancing effect unless taken in huge quantities. Even so, he said many elite athletes would be wary of using such supplements because they can be laced with banned substances and few would want to risk it. Pistorius was charged with premeditated murder on February 14 after shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. He says he shot her by accident after mistaking her for an intruder in his home. Prosecutors allege he intended to kill her. Meanwhile Pistorius was last night due to hold a private memorial service for his girlfriend. Confirmation . of the service to be held at the house of Pistorius’s uncle Arnold in . Pretoria, where he has been staying since his release on bail, came . after a leak in the media, reported Sky News. A . family statement said: ‘Since it is such a sensitive issue, Oscar has . asked for a private service with people who share his loss, including . his family members who knew and loved Reeva.’ Pistorius says he killed Miss Steenkamp accidentally, opening fire after mistaking her for an intruder in his home. Prosecutors alleged he intentionally shot her after the couple had an argument. Last week, the chief investigator in the case against Pistorius, Hilton Botha, was removed from the inquiry after it was revealed that attempted murder charges against him had been reinstated in early February. Charged: Carl Pistorius, with sister Aimee, in court to see their brother Oscar granted bail after being charged with murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . The charges relate to a 2011 incident in which Botha and two other police officers allegedly fired on a minibus. In another twist, a lawyer for the Pistorius family said on Sunday that Oscar's brother, Carl, faces a charge of unlawful, negligent killing for a 2008 road death. That charge had also been dropped and later reinstated.","South African police initially named substance as testosterone .

His bizarre four-minute outburst took place in front of thousands of lunchtime shoppers in the city centre today. He told them: 'I'm really sorry, I'm not here to hurt you, you better take cover though - as I just need to smash up your shop.' Six officers, including a police dog handler, were called to the scene where they restrained and disarmed the man just outside the shop's Lower Mall entrance.

Jailed: Lewis Robert McDonald veered across carriageways and went the wrong way round a roundabout while drunk . A coach driver who took passengers on a terrifying 70-mile journey while drunk has been jailed for nine months. Lewis Robert McDonald, 68, of St Helen's, Merseyside, veered across carriageways and drove the wrong way round a roundabout forcing other drivers off the road during the journey from Liverpool to Penley in November last year. The horrified passengers, members of a primary school PTA who had been on a shopping trip, screamed at McDonald to get on the right side of the road while drivers hooted their horns. As the coach went over The River Dee, the passengers feared they were going to end up in the river. When the coach eventually stopped, a motorist who had followed for 15 miles jumped on board and seized the coach ignition keys to stop McDonald driving any further. According to police, when they arrived to arrest him, McDonald said: 'That's me finished.' A breath test three hours after he set off from Liverpool showed McDonald, a coach driver for 40 years, had 58 microgrammes of alcohol in his breath compared to the legal limit of 35. Mold Crown Court heard how the 49-seater coach had been booked by the PTA of Madras Primary School in Penley to take 30 adults and four teenagers on a shopping trip to Liverpool One. McDonald was an hour late picking them up in the morning because he could not find the village but at this point no-one was concerned about his driving to Liverpool. However, prosecuting barrister Caroline Harris said he was 15 minutes late collecting them in the evening. Headmistress Lynda Houston later described how on the M53 McDonald drove in the middle lane at about 20mph.

A drug addict who beheaded a British grandmother in a frenzied knife attack on the holiday island of Tenerife has been sentenced to 20 years in a secure psychiatric unit. Homeless Bulgarian Deyan Deyanov, 29, was convicted of murder by a jury of nine at the Provincial Court in Santa Cruz de Tenerife on Friday. He repeatedly stabbed and beheaded Jennifer Mills-Westley, 60, while she was shopping in the popular resort of Los Cristianos in the Canary Islands, Spain, on May 13 2011. Guilty: Deyan Deyanov (right) was convicted of the . murder of British grandmother Jennifer Mills-Westley (left) Deyan Deyanov repeatedly stabbed and beheaded Jennifer Mills-Westley while she was shopping in the popular resort of Los Cristianos . In a written sentence, magistrate Maria Jesus Garcia Sanchez imposed the toughest tariff available for the schizophrenic, who the jury found had diminished responsibility for his crime. She also ordered that Deyanov, who was living rough when he randomly murdered Ms Mills-Westley, should pay her daughters, Sarah and Samantha Mills-Westley, 100,000 euros. During a four-day trial, Deyanov denied murder and said he did not recognise himself in CCTV footage of the attack shown to the jury. He also claimed to hear voices which tell him he is an 'angel of Jesus Christ', sent to create a new Jerusalem. Paranoid: Deyanov is a paranoid schizophrenic who said he was an angel of Jesus Christ . Devastated: Mrs Mills-Westley daughters arrive in court to hear the result of the case . In her written sentence Ms Garcia Sanchez said she took into account the 'criminal danger' Deyanov represented. She said Ms Mills-Westley had no chance given the 'forceful and unexpected' nature of the attack she suffered. 'Frequently, homicidal intent is something which must be inferred,' she added. 'In this case, homicidal intent exists without a doubt and inferences are unnecessary.' The paranoid schizophrenic had been allowed to leave a specialist unit in Wales seven months earlier. The victim’s daughter Sarah, 43, read . a statement on behalf of her and sister Samantha, 39, outside the . Spanish court, after he was found guilty which read: ‘It’s hard to put into words the devastating . impact that this preventable and needless act has had on us as a family, . sadly Mum was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Footage: CCTV footage of the fatal attack on Ms Mills-Westley (right) was shown in court (left). After being shown the video Deyanov said it . was 'a montage, a film' and claimed that he did not recognise himself . ‘Lessons must be learnt from this . tragic event to ensure justice is done for our mum and to ensure that no . other family has to be subjected to this ordeal. 'It is clear to us that . there has been a catalogue of failings. ‘We will be asking the Welsh health authority to carry out a full inquiry.’ Drug-user Deyanov was sectioned under . the Mental Health Act and admitted to Glan Clwyd Hospital’s Ablett . Psychiatric Unit in North Wales in summer 2010. But he left the unit in October that year and moved to Tenerife, where his drug use and mental health problems worsened. There was a warrant out for his arrest three days before the murder but police failed to locate him. Asked if there was anything he wanted to say after the verdict was read out, Deyanov then declared to a hushed courtroom: 'I am the second reincarnation of Jesus Christ and I . will bring the fire of the Holy Spirit to bear against this court.' Business as usual: The shop where Mrs Mills-Westley was attacked was trading again less than 24 hours after the killing . Amateur footage: After watching the CCTV footage, Deyanov . said it was 'a montage, a film' and claimed that he did not recognise . himself in the images . Tackled to the ground: He also denied that he . had lived in Wales, where he was sectioned in the summer of 2010 under . the Mental Health Act at Glan Clwyd Hospital . He carried out the attack  in . the popular resort of Los Cristianos on May 13, 2011 in a shopping . centre that was already bustling with tourists of all nationalities. The mother of two who split her time . between homes in Tenerife and Norwich, Norfolk, was picked at random . after voices in Deyanov's head ordered him to kill, the court heard. But despite his schizophrenia, the jury . found that Deyanov was guilty of murder under Spanish law because he . took his victim by surprise and she could not defend herself. Wearing . an olive green hoodie, black tracksuit trousers and running shoes, . Deyanov remained quiet and still as the verdict was read out. The . victim's daughters Samantha, 39, and Sarah, 43, have attended the . entire trial of their mother's killer since it began. They . were accompanied by Sarah’s partner Brian Moore, 41, the victim’s . brother John Smith, 63, and sister-in-law, Julie Smith, 62. Reading the statement outside court, . Sarah Mills-Westley, who lives in the Midi-Pyrenees region of France . said: 'Despite our expectations, we have been disappointed by the lack . of any other support - notably the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and . our mum's MP in her hometown of Norwich. 'Whilst today closes one chapter, we will have to live with the painful consequences for the rest of our lives. 'We ask that we are now granted privacy after an extremely difficult and emotional week.' Asked if the family would talk to . authorities in the UK to find out why Deyanov was released from hospital . in Wales, she said: 'We will be asking the Welsh Health Authority to . conduct a full inquiry into what happened in particular around his . treatment in the UK.' The defendant said he had been using crack cocaine and LSD before his arrest, but had no memory of living in Tenerife . Drug-addled drifter: Deyanov was a drifter who . had lived in Tenerife and Wales where in 2010 he was sectioned under the . mental health act . Ms Mills-Westley said the care of people like Deyanov should be taken more seriously. She said: 'Since the May 13 2011, Jennifer Mills-Westley has become known as the lady who was beheaded in Tenerife. 'The truth is she was our mum, our mentor and our best friend. 'She was a highly gifted, selfless person with so much love in her heart and who has been taken away from us in her prime. 'It’s . hard to put into words the devastating impact that this preventable and . needless act has had on us as a family - sadly mum was in the wrong . place at the wrong time.' Deyanov, who earlier claimed in court to be 'an angel of Jesus Christ', had denied murder, claiming security camera . footage of him carrying out the gruesome murder was 'a montage'. Answering questions in Bulgarian with . the help of an interpreter, Deyanov also told the court he is haunted by . voices which tell him how to act. He claimed they were telling him he was 'an angel of Jesus Christ who is going to create a new Jerusalem', adding: 'They direct how I act, sometimes they say kill, fight, hit, pray.' Prosecutor Angel Garcia Rodriguez asked for the maximum sentence of 20 years in a secure psychiatric ward to be imposed. Defence lawyer Francisco Beltran said . the former timeshare dealer should get the minimum sentence of 15 . years, saying Deyanov was 'a sick man who requires help'. He . has blamed Spanish authorities for the murder, telling the court: 'He . might as well have been carrying a sign saying ""I'm a bomb and I could . explode at any moment"",' defence lawyer Francisco Beltran said. 'Responsibility must fall to some extent with the health authorities in the Canary Islands,' he added. 'My client is a sick man, not a criminal, and he should have been diagnosed and treated. 'Why was he not diagnosed and treated properly? He was suffering from acute paranoid schizophrenia. Why was he released?'","Deyan Deyanov killed Jennifer Mills-Westley, 60, in Los Cristianos in 2011 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:48 EST, 28 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:31 EST, 28 February 2013 . While most children enjoy nothing more than playing outside on a warm summer's day, seven-year-old Sarah Larimore dreads it - because she cannot sweat. After just minutes in the sun in her native South Carolina, the young girl becomes over-heated and dizzy, and must instead be confined indoors, where she takes 33 daily medications for her condition. Her parents have spoken about the everyday struggles of her illness as Thursday marks Rare Disease Day, which was established by the National Organization for Rare Disorders in 2009. Sarah suffers from a rare genetic disorder called cystinosis, which prevents her from sweating and causes other problems, such as kidney failure, rickets, muscle wasting and stunted growth. Scroll down for video . Rare condition: Sarah Larimore, seven, suffers from a disease that means her body is unable to sweat . As her parents battle to make her life easier, they have come up with one remedy for the summer's sun, and built a swimming pool in their backyard last summer. 'It was her first real, live outside summer,' her mother, Katie Larimore, told ABC News. 'She just stayed in the water for three months.' But many other parts of her day are not so easy; she takes 33 pills, one injection of growth hormone, 14 eye drops to prevent blindness and seven meals through a feeding tube in her stomach. Cystagon, a medication she takes six times a day, including in the middle of the night, makes her breath stink, and the smell even seeps through her pores, her mother said. By the time she is a teenager, she will . need 80 pills every day, and she will also require a kidney transplant . by the time she is 15. Struggle: Every day as she battles cystinosis, Sarah must take 33 pills, one injection of growth hormone and eye drops and she eats seven meals through a feeding tube in her stomach . Support: Her father, Jeff Larimore, is the president of Cystinosis Research Network, which helps families with children with the condition . Her illness also means she rarely manages a whole week at school, but her parents told the Columbia Star that the support of Sarah's teachers has been phenomenal. Her teacher even suggested they speak to the class about Sarah's condition, Mrs Larimore said. Sarah suffers from Cystinosis, a rare genetic metabolic disorder. It causes an amino acid, cystine, to accumulate in every cell of the body, . damaging organs and blood cells. Because of this defect in transportation . of the amino acid, the cell crystallizes and causes early cell death. Cystinosis slowly destroys the organs in the body including the kidneys, . liver, eyes, muscles and the brain. Common symptoms include kidney failure, mineral depletion, small . stature, rickets, malnourishment, frequent urination, muscle wasting, and . cysteine crystals in the corneas. It is an autosomal recessive genetic disease, which means that both parents are carriers of the gene that leads to this condition. The parents do not exhibit any of the symptoms and the odds are that one-in-four of their children will have cystinosis. Sarah is the only one out of four siblings with the condition. She is one of 500 Americans with the condition, according to the . Cystinosis Research Network. An estimated 2,000 people suffer from . the illness worldwide. She is also one of at least 25 million Americans who suffer from rare conditions, according to the National Institutes of Health. '[The children] thought Sarah was a hero . to be able to swallow 33 pills a day,' she said. 'And now, they look . out for her, they baby her, and they have embraced her because of the . difference. 'It was an excellent . call from an excellent teacher.' Sarah also catches up with school work during summer recesses, as she is unable to go outside in the South Carolina sun without becoming ill. The reason she is unable to sweat is just 'one of those mysteries of cystinosis', her mother said. She was diagnosed with the condition at 15 months old. Her parents, who have three older children, knew something was wrong when she stopped growing and needed to drink two gallons of water every day, and they sought out professional help. 'Being she was my fourth, I knew . something was wrong,' Mrs Larimore told ABC. 'Sarah was very, very tiny at . this point because she had stopped growing. I went from doctor to . doctor until I found one that believed me.' They came across one doctor who was treating another patient with the same condition, and Sarah was diagnosed with infantile nephropathic cystinosis, the most severe . form. 'Her prognosis is unknown,' Mrs Larimore told the Columbia Star. 'Technically, . cystinosis is considered terminal because there is no cure. Jeff and I . don't like to think that way. So, we just go with the idea that there’s . no expiration date stamped on her anywhere.' Each month the family spends around . $5,000 on medication, doctors' visits and supplies, most of which is . currently covered by insurance. Taking it in her stride: Sarah told her classmates about her condition during a presentation at school and now they all rally around her to help, her parents said . But they are also battling for new medication for their daughter which will make her life easier. A company is expected to get FDA . approval for a new drug over the next few months that could replace Cystagon, and which would last for 12 hours instead of six, her parents said. The family also went to Washington D.C. last month to speak with their representatives in Congress and ask them not to cut funding to research programs as sequester budget cuts loom. Among their requests, they argued to keep funding for the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, which gives pharmaceutical companies tax incentives and other help so that they research rare illnesses. They also argued for a Medicare policy known as TEFRA, in which middle-class families in 26 states get federal dollars to help pay for the costs of caring for a child with serious illnesses.","Sarah Larimore must take 33 pills every day for her condition .

The Connecticut priest charged last month with dealing crystal meth was feared to be on the brink of a nervous breakdown, it has been revealed, as the cracks began to appear at the start of his astonishing fall from grace. Former colleagues of Monsignor Kevin Wallin have said he had been struggling with his faith for years as he was affected by the stress of running a financially crippled church. Friends of the former priest, who have suggested his alleged drug use may have been a more recent development of his fall, grew increasingly concerned for his welfare before he left his post, including one who said he looked like 'a refugee from a concentration camp'. Concerns: Former colleagues of Monsignor Kevin Wallin have said he was struggling with his faith before his fall from grace . According to the New York Times, Wallin would miss appointments and was once three hours late for a wedding, as concerns for his welfare grew. The suspended Roman Catholic priest was arrested on federal drug charges last month for allegedly having methamphetamine mailed to him from co-conspirators in California and making more than $300,000 in drugs sales out of his apartment in Waterbury in the second half of last year. Along the way, authorities said, he . bought a small adult video and sex toy shop in the nearby town of North . Haven named 'Land of Oz & Dorothy's Place,' apparently to launder . all the money he was making. Wallin, 61, was the pastor of St. Augustine Parish in Bridgeport for nine years until he resigned in June . 2011, citing health and personal problems. He previously served six . years as pastor of St. Peter's Church in Danbury until 2002. According to the New York Times report, the priest was expected by many to become a bishop. But the report states he began wrestling with his faith, with one church worker saying: 'He had become disillusioned with the bureaucracy of the church.' The worker and others said the priest had long had sex with men. The report says friends became concerned about the state of his mind as he was found to be 'very off-kilter' by early 2011, and one close friend said he sometimes spoke incessantly. Arrested: Wallin was last month charged with dealing crystal meth . In June of that year he was told to resign by Bishop William E. Lori following allegations 'of sexual activity in the rectory', according to the New York Times report. He was ordered to get a medical evaluation, which found he needed treatment, which he resisted, leading Bishop Lori to suspend his faculties, meaning he was not allowed to act publicly as a priest. Later that month he checked into St Luke Institute, a psychiatric hospital which treats Catholic clergymen, where, according to some who know him, his amphetamine use was found out. Against staff wishes, he left the hospital on November 4. Authorities believe by the following year he had become a drug dealer, living in an apartment in Waterbury. Federal agents arrested Wallin on January 3, and a grand jury indicted him and four other people on drug charges on January 15. All are charged with one count of . conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of a substance containing . methamphetamine and 50 grams of actual methamphetamine, a crime that . carries 10 years to life in prison upon conviction. Wallin is also charged with six counts of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Last July, Drug Enforcement . Administration agents in New York told agents in the New Haven office . that there was an unidentified Connecticut-based drug trafficker . distributing methamphetamine in the region. Two months later, an informant told . the DEA that the trafficker was Wallin, according to an affidavit by . agent Jay Salvatore in New Haven. Trusted: Msgr Wallin served as the pastor at St. Augustine's in Bridgeport for nine years before taking a sabbatical in 2011 for health and personal reasons . The Connecticut Statewide Narcotics Task Force was also investigating Wallin. Authorities said an undercover . officer with the state task force bought methamphetamine from Wallin six . times from September 20 to January 2, paying more than $3,400 in total for 23 . grammes of the drug. Federal agents also say they learned through wiretaps and informants about other sales Wallin was making. The priest and four others were arrested for allegedly conspiring to distribute crystal meth . Connecticut U.S. Attorney David Fein . said federal and state authorities worked together in 'the dismantling . of what we allege was a significant methamphetamine distribution . organisation that spanned from California to Connecticut.' Also charged in the case were Kenneth . Devries, 52, of Waterbury; Michael Nelson, 40, of Manchester; Chad . McCluskey, 43, of San Clemente, California; and Kristen Laschober, 47, of . Laguna Niguel, California. Authorities say McCluskey and Laschober were . involved in the shipping of methamphetamine to Wallin. Wallin faces up to 20 years behind bars and a $2million fine if convicted. Wallin allegedly bought the Land of OZ sex shop to launder his drug money .

Guerra was a freelance photographer who submitted pictures to AKI images/GSI Media for syndication, the company confirmed today. Los Angeles police officer Sergeant Rudy Lopez said the highway patrol men had noticed the photographer taking pictures close to the scene. He said one of the officers asked him to return to his vehicle.

The . sports car - which contained two of Bieber's friends, with rapper Lil Twist believed to be behind the wheel - was parked on the side of Sepulveda Boulevard near Getty . Center Drive after the traffic stop. According to sources, Lil Twist - real name Christopher Moore - was with Bieber at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills on Tuesday afternoon when he left in the white Ferrari without Justin.

A representative for the department did not immediately return MailOnline's request for comment. According to TMZ, Guerra claimed to friends earlier in the day that he had spotted Bieber smoking what he believed to be marijuana from a pipe while driving the Ferrari. A source said the photographer told him he was following the singer back to the Four . Seasons and was continuing to pursue what he believed was a big story. The . source says after 20 minutes, Guerra hung up as he said the Ferrari was . pulling out of the hotel parking lot and he needed to hang up and follow . it.  Apparently he had no idea Bieber in the car. The longtime friend, who spoke with Chris at 5:16 PM - less than an hour before he was killed - was one of his closest friends told TMZ he belived Bieber is partly to blame for Guerra's death because of the singer's reckless driving history and alleged pot smoking which made it a big story to follow. Bieber had already been pulled over by police in his Ferrari while driving through West Hollywood in November. He was initially pulled over for making an unsafe left turn.

But this young girl nearly died after her spine started to curve like a snake. Emily Crosby, 13, looked like she had a fin between her shoulders where her backbone stuck out. The teenager’s vertebrae were curved at a 90 degree angle and twisted 50 degrees in the opposite direction further down – creating a giant ‘s’ shape. Emily trains with her local dance academy . Before her operation, Emily's spine had a double curve (left). She . underwent an 11 hour operation to fit a titanium rod to her spine . (right) Doctors were unsure what caused her scoliosis – or curvature of the spine – but said it was the worst case they had ever seen. The condition developed in just half a year. Her parents originally thought it was being caused by an ill-fitting bra. It was only when doctors examined her . that they realised her life was at risk. They told Emily that if her . spine curved any more it could puncture her lung. Emily was saved by an 11-hour operation in which surgeons inserted a rod into her back to straighten it out. Before the operation (left) Emily's ribs were crushing her lungs. Now . (right) she has recovered sufficiently to take part in a netball . tournament in Italy . Her mother Jackie, 45, said: ‘They had to pick me off the floor when they told me. It was awful. ‘We thought the doctor was showing us . an X-ray of the worst-case scenario but it was actually my daughter’s . spine on the screen. ‘I cried a lot. Emily is very fit and active so we never knew anything was wrong.  She never felt any pain. Emily Crosby (right, pictured with her mother, left) underwent an 11 hour operation to straighten her spine . ‘When we got to the hospital and the . doctor asked her to bend forward I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Her spine was sticking out like a shark’s fin.’ Mrs Crosby and her husband Glen, 45, a . project manager, said Emily’s spine had been perfectly straight when . they had gone on holiday together just six months earlier. It was Emily’s dance teacher who realised her back was misaligned, as she had studied the condition on a physiotherapy course. In June last year the schoolgirl, from . Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, underwent a day of surgery at nearby . James Cook University Hospital. She had a titanium rod inserted and . fixed on to her spine with 18 screws. At one point during the operation, . surgeons were forced to stop when a machine monitoring Emily’s progress . delivered a reading of paralysis. Thankfully it was a false alarm. Her mother said: ‘I was so nervous . when she went into theatre. It sounds awful to say, but one slip of the . knife and she’s paralysed. That’s all it takes.’ Emily recovered rapidly from the . surgery. Doctors were amazed to find she could do the splits just two . weeks after the operation. The teenager is now back to full fitness and enjoys dancing and playing sport. She has finished a stint performing in . a pantomime, trains with her local dance school and is even competing . in a netball tournament in Italy at the end of the month. She also took . part in a Boxing Day dip, raising £450 for the spinal unit to thank it . for saving her life. Mrs Crosby added: ‘We are so proud of . her. Even though her operation was so serious, she was determined to . show other children with the same condition that you can still be active . and enjoy your life.’ Doctors are unable to explain why . eight out of ten children develop scoliosis. It is not thought to be . caused by posture, exercise or diet.","Emily Crosby, 13, had one of the worst cases of scoliosis doctors had seen .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:44 EST, 3 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:41 EST, 3 October 2012 . Ed Miliband today said he wants builders, plumbers and mechanics to stand as Labour MPs in a further escalation of his attempt to draw a class divide with David Cameron’s Tories. The Labour leader said he wanted fewer ‘middle class’ candidates standing for his party in 2015. And he renewed his attacks on the competence of the government, branding ministers ‘useless’. Labour leader Ed Miliband took questions from party members on the fourth day of his conference in Manchester . Party members were so keen to ask a question they went to great lengths to attract his attention. Delegates were seen waving umbrellas, crutches, flags and even cuddly toys to catch his eye. One construction worker, wielding a hard hat, called for more builders, plumbers, mechanics and shop workers to be selected as Labour candidates in winnable seats. Mr Miliband backed the idea and said it was ‘something that I have made a bigger feature of my leadership’. He added: ‘I am not going to start saying we are going to decide who the candidates are but we do have a responsibility to make sure it is not just people from middle class backgrounds to into the contest. You have more absolute commitment. ‘We are right to say we need more women and we need 50 per cent of our MPs being women in my view, that is the only way we can be a truly representative country. We need to be more diverse in terms of ethnic diversity. ‘But it is also got to be more diverse in terms of class background.’ John Trickett, the shadow cabinet office minister, is reviewing how the party chooses candidates. Queuing app: Delegates at the conference try to catch the eye of Labour leader using old methods and new . Ed Miliband's conference speech drew heavily on the One Nation theme of Tory Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. But today Lord Prescott admitted he did no know who the Conservative was. He told BBC2's Politics Show: 'You know me, I'm not an intellectual. Who the hell's Disraeli? 'The Labour Party changes. Ed did a brilliant speech there.' Mr Miliband unveiled what was described as One Nation Labour, noting that Disraeli gave a famous three-hour speech on the subject in 1842 at the Free Trade Hall, just yards from where the Labour conference is being held. Lord Prescott added: 'We've had New Labour, Old Labour, all sorts of Labour. I'm just Labour - traditional values in a modern setting. 'I'm the old man in this, but I still think when he talks about the health service, about getting our people back to work and making the changes, having a go at the banks - it sounds like traditional values to me.' Speaking at a fringe meeting today, . Mr Trickett, a former plumber, said: ‘We need to rebuild our party in . the image of the rest of the nation. 'This means redressing the problem of . working class representation. Let me just say this, 7 per cent of the . population went to a public school but 35 per cent of MPs went to a . public school – five times as many as in the wider population. We have . to make sure we reverse the trend we have seen.’ Mr Miliband has been accused of using . class attacks on Mr Cameron, using a party political broadcast and his . main conference speech to highlight his education at a comprehensive . school while the Prime Minister went to Eton. In interviews today he seemed to be rowing back, insisting: ‘I am not making an issue of David Cameron’s background.’ However, his announcement that he . wants class background to be a consideration when select candidates will . fuel speculation that he will target the upbringing and wealth of the . Tory Cabinet at the next election. He was challenged over his support for public sector freezes and tuition fees, and Labour environment policy. And he revealed he would attend a . union march against spending cuts on October 20, accusing the Government . of an 'arrogant' approach to public services. 'There has got to be an end to a style of government which is just arrogant and high-handed,' he said. 'It doesn't mean that there won't be . disagreements between public servants and a Labour government but it . does mean that you have got to be able to listen. 'And this Government is just totally unable to listen and just behaves in an incredibly high-handed way.' Mr Miliband's new slogan appears to . have caught on. He revealed his two-year-old son Sam was watching the . speech, and after 15 minutes he suddenly said 'One Nation'. But he admitted he thought his wife was 'trying to make me feel good, but anyway'. Mr . Miliband renewed his attack on government competence, citing today's . revelation that the West Coast Mainline franchise process was flawed. He . said: 'I had the list yesterday of the incompetence of this government, . little did I know that the lost would be out of date in less than 24 . hours. ‘What can you say about the West Coast Mainline fiasco. ‘It is a disgrace that it is going to cost £40m of taxpayers money because they have so bungled this franchise. ‘The Prime Minister needs to get a grip on this useless incompetent government. ‘There is a pattern  with this government. Already we see them scurrying for cover. It is not their fault. ‘They always find somebody else to blame, this time it’s the civil service. ‘It’s . David Cameron’s ABC. When it comes to who is to blame, it is ""Anybody . But Cameron"". That is the reality of this government.’ Mr Miliband's schooldays at a comprehensive school are being contrasted with David Cameron's time at Eton . Tonight a . Labour party political broadcast will again emphasise Mr Miliband's . upbringing and experience at Haverstock school, a comprehensive in north . London. In the broadcast, Mr  Miliband says: . 'Every young person should feel they can have a career, a future like I . had, you shouldn’t be the lucky few. 'I think the education that I got at this comprehensive was so much more than how to pass exams. 'It . was about how do you look after yourself, it was about the world is a . complex place with people of all kinds and all nationalities, all . classes, all races and you know, that is a really important lesson in . life.' Earlier, the Liberal Democrats launched a poster campaign in Manchester attacking Mr Miliband. A . van circulated the city with an advert depicting the Labour leader as a . poodle on a lead held by a pin-striped banker, under the slogan: . 'Labour: 13 years as the bankers' lapdog. Two years trying to hide it.' A . Lib Dem spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband's political education didn't take . place at school in Primrose Hill but in the Treasury under Gordon Brown. 'He and Ed Balls were special advisers to Brown when they let the banks run amok and claimed to have abolished boom and bust.' But Labour was disimissive of the criticism. A . Labour source said: 'This is ridiculous, desperate stuff from a party . that voted to help David Cameron give a £40,000 tax cut to 8,000 . millionaires.'","Labour leader says he wants social background to be considered when selecting Labour election candidates .

'It makes me feel better to know that when I can't look after him anymore I will be able to put something else in place. 'I felt angry against the hospital. If they had done their job properly we would have normal and healthy child. 'I was mortified to think that through no fault of my own that my son had cerebral palsy. 'Medical experts have spent the last 14 years trying to establish what happened and what went wrong. 'In the end the hospital trust admitted liability but only because I refused to back down. 'They should have admitted it a lot sooner because they had been in the wrong and not have me battling this for most of my adult life.' Mrs Scott had a normal and healthy pregnancy until she went to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital in 1998 after going into labour. Charlie's mother said of the money awarded: 'No amount of compensation makes up for the disability, but it's security' She said: 'When Charlie was born I knew something was wrong. He was white, the colour of a piece of paper and all his extremities were blue; his lips, fingernails, everything. 'It was 55 minutes before he breathed on his own, it all kind of happened in slow motion. 'If they had transferred to Poole hospital for specialist treatment the odds are it never would have happened. Charlie pictured in a motorised wheel chair. His mother said it felt strange to finally have closure . 'They had procedures in place for emergencies but basically none of it ever happened. 'We decided to take action against the hospital when Charlie was nine-months-old because I knew that something had happened to make him disabled. 'I adore Charlie but life is very hard, he needs constant care and attention, so I did it because I want him to be looked after in the future. 'Social services have been brilliant, however every time we need something we have to be assessed and it's so drawn out. 'We never really discussed how much we might get because nobody really knew, but I wanted to be able to say 'Charlie needs a new wheelchair, let's go and get him one'. 'It was a really weird feeling, it was just so strange to know that after all that time and all the fighting and the appointments with medics, experts, and consultants, that that was it. 'My message to others would be don't give up, no matter how hard it gets.' Mrs Scott has four other sons; Spencer, 12, Harrison, seven, and Austin and Willis, both six, who Charlie enjoys playing with.

A leading paparazzo who has photographed many of the world's biggest celebrities has been shot dead in Rome. Daniele Lo Presti was found with a single bullet in his head, prompting fears he had fallen victim to a Mafia-style execution. The 42-year-old photographer was discovered lying face down in a pool of blood in the Testaccio district in the southwest of Rome on a cycling track where he regularly went jogging. His body was apparently found by friends with whom he had previously arranged to go running. Killed: Daniele Lo Presti was found dead in Rome, Italy, on Thursday with a gunshot to the head . Killed: Paparazzo Daniele Lo Presti was found with a bullet in his head in a busy street in Rome . Stars who have been photographed by Lo Presti include Rihanna, Beyoncé and Scarlett Johansson. He also snapped designers Stefano Dolce and Domenico Gabbana on their yacht. But perhaps his biggest hit came when he snapped pictures in Malta of Brad Pitt with a female assistant, which were said to have angered the actor's fiancée Angelina Jolie. An officer attached to the investigation said: 'He was killed with a single shot from a small calibre weapon. 'It could be he fell foul of a Mafia crime family or someone else who really didn't want their picture taken.' At work: Daniele Lo Presti travelled the world taking photots and was best known for his shots of Brad Pitt with another woman . Targets: Stars who were photographed by Lo Presti included Brad Pitt and Beyoncé . A police spokesman added: 'Lo Presti was a well-known paparazzo photographer and his scoops embarrassed many people. 'We are not ruling out a connection between his work and his death, and we are looking through all his most recent assignments as well as phone and computer records.' There is no suggestion that any of his celebrity subjects is in any way linked to his death. Five years ago, Lo Presti was apparently attacked by arsonists who burned his car and threatened his family. And just last month a colleague of his at photo agency LaPresse, Danilo Ceretti, died in a mysterious motorcycle crash. The word 'paparazzi' originates from the 1960 film La Dolce Vita, directed by Federico Fellini. The film, starring Marcello Mastroianni, Anita Ekberg and Anouk Aimée, is set in Rome during a period when obsession with celebrity was at a new all-time high in Italy. All the famous actresses of the day, from Brigitte Bardot to Joan Crawford, would be spotted out and about in the city and pictured by a waiting mass of photographers. La Dolce Vita follows a struggling journalist's week in the glamorous Roman city and features a news photographer named Paparazzo, played by Walter Santesso. It is this character that helped coin the term 'paparazzi' for freelance photographers. Director Fellini is believed to have come up with the name for the character from an Italian dialect word 'papataceo' that describes the buzzing of a mosquito. In an interview with Time magazine, Fellini said: 'Paparazzo… suggests to me a buzzing insect, hovering, darting, stinging.' But other accounts claim Fellini took the name from a character in the 1901 novel, By The Ionian Sea. The film La Dolce Vita - which . translates as 'the sweet life' - also left another legacy, making the phrase . synonymous around the world for 'living the good life' or 'high life'. A character in the hit film La Dolce Vita - a photographer called Paparazzo who was played by Walter Santesso - is responsible for helping to coin the term paparazzi . This . phrase would have been commonplace in Italian-speaking countries prior . to 1960 but only became part of the English language after the release of the popular . film. The film received 20 minutes of applause when a rough edit was shown and won the Palme d'Or at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. But La Dolce Vita is still mostly remembered for creating Paparazzo, which by the late 1960s had entered English as a generic term for intrusive photographers. The Oxford dictionary describes a paparazzo as: 'A freelance photographer who pursues celebrities to get photographs of them'. And a person who has been photographed by the Paparazzi is said to have been 'Papped'. When La Dolce Vita was made, photographers were paid around $500 per photo. Today, the figure for an exclusive picture of a high-profile celebrity can be limitless.","Daniele Lo Presti discovered lying face down in pool of blood on the street .

Police, health and ambulance services are being secretly privatised by the coalition government, Labour claimed today. Seeking to capitalise on Ed Miliband’s speech which aggressively attacked the Conservative’s stewardship of public services, the party today stepped up its criticism of private firms being handed multi-million contracts to replace state workers. They claim ministers have failed to learn the lessons of bungled contracts and broken promises, seen most recently when private security firm G4S failed to deliver thousands of security staff for the London Olympics. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper attacked plans to allow private firms to police the streets . Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, warned that contracts were being signed this week to take more than 300 community services out of the NHS altogether. And shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Labour would limit the privatisation of the police as she seeks to assume the mantle of former Conservative Home Secretary Robert Peel. It comes a day after Mr Miliband attempted to steal the ‘One Nation’ slogan from Benjamin Disraeli, another Tory figure from the nineteenth-century. Ms Cooper claims the Tories are no longer the party of Peel, the man who, as Home Secretary, established the Metropolitan Police. Police failings in investigating phone hacking, the Hillsborough tragedy and the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protest demoanstrate the need for a new, more powerful watchdog, Yvette Cooper said today. The shadow home secretary said a Labour government would abolish the Independent Police Complaints Commission and create a stronger Police Standards Authority ‘to raise standards, pursue powerful investigations and ensure there are proper safeguards in place’. Ms Cooper told the Labour conference in Manchester: ‘It took too long to get a new hacking investigation underway. ‘It took too long for the truth to come out about what happened to Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protest. ‘And it took far, far, far too long for the truth to come out about the tragedy and senior police cover up at Hillsborough. ‘Liverpool needs justice. But we also need to make sure no one ever, ever again has to fight for the truth for 23 years after losing a loved one or child.’ She says Labour in power would reverse Conservative reforms which have made it easier for private companies to bid for neighbourhood patrols and even detective work, adding: ‘We don’t want private companies patrolling the public streets of Britain.’ This is at odds with the ‘British policing model’, under which the police force is publicly run and takes place with the consent of the public – not imposed from above in a militaristic fashion. ‘Labour police and crime commissioners will halt this Tory rush to the privatisation of our police,’ she said. ‘Tory ministers want huge swathes of policing handed over to private companies. 'Nothing ruled out. Contract tenders which include neighbourhood patrols, detective investigations and more. Pushing forces to sign up to massive contracts with a single organisation where value for money is at risk. ‘Have they learned nothing from the Olympics?’ Miss Cooper admitted that public-private partnerships can be acceptable in areas such as new technology. But she warned: ‘Policing by consent means the police need the confidence of the public. And the public need to know that policing is in the interests of the community not just the terms of the contract. ‘Policing in the interests of justice, not just the corporate balance sheet. ‘We don’t want private companies patrolling the public streets of Britain. 'We want police officers and PCSOs policing our communities – not private companies putting them under guard.’ Ms Cooper also paid tribute to Manchester police officers PC Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone who were killed on duty last month. 'They answered a 999 call as police officers do every single day of the week, not knowing what they will find. 'They were shot down in a brutal act. They showed bravery they and other emergency services take for granted, but that we never must.' PC Hughes' funeral was being held in Manchester Cathedral today and PC Bone's is being held tomorrow. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham claimed the NHS is facing its 'biggest act of privatisation ever seen' Labour today also sought to exploit Tory trust on the NHS, accusing Mr Cameron of a ‘great NHS carve-up’. Data released under Freedom of Information laws show contracts worth £250million for 396 health services across England, including diagnostic testing, podiatry and adult hearing, are being handed to private firms. Mr Burnham branded it the ‘biggest act of privatisation ever seen in the NHS’. He received a standing ovation for warning of the threat to the health service. 'The N in NHS under sustained attack,' he told delegates. 'A postcode lottery running riot - older people denied cataract and hip operations.  NHS privatisation at a pace and scale never seen before. 'Be warned – Cameron’s Great NHS Carve-Up is coming to your community. 'As we speak, contracts are being signed in the single biggest act of privatisation the NHS has ever seen.' A third of health trusts said they would not have looked to privatise the services without a new ruling from ministers that they must offer three services from a list of eight to tender. Mr Burnham also published details of a bus company taking over non-emergency ambulance services in Greater Manchester and a HealthWatch patient advocacy service being outsourced in Lancashire.He called for an end to health trusts having to put services out to tender under the Any Qualified Provider rules. But he was unable to give a clear list of services Labour would prevent from being privatised in future and admitted the last government 'let the market in too far'. ‘Since we were in government the debate has changed about the private sector and it’s reliability,’ Mr Burnham said, pointing to G4S, the banking crisis and the PIP breast implant scandal. ‘While you can take some risks in other areas you cannot take risks in healthcare. ‘I have always felt there are limits to the market in healthcare. It is different because people’s lives depend on it.’","Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper warns against private firms policing the streets .

A consortium from the Middle East has launched the biggest ever takeover bid for a football club with an offer of £1.5bn for Premier League side Arsenal. The group, made up of investors from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, hope to tempt American owner Stan Kroenke with the world record sum, reports the Sunday Telegraph. The mystery consortium members, who are apparently being backed by funds from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, are to bid for every share in the club and have promised the money will be invested in the faltering team, who face a battle to qualify for next season's lucrative Champions League competition. Money men: Arsenal majority owner Stan Kroenke (left) and major shareholder Alisher Usmanov . It blows out of the water the world's previous highest bid for a football team the £800m was made by the American Glazer family for Manchester United and reinforces the growing power wielded by the Middle East in the European game. Qataris already own another leading Premier League side, Manchester City, who are bankrolled by billionaire Sheik Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, while French club Paris St Germain, who recently signed David Beckham, are backed by the Qatar Investment Authority. American Kroenke is the club's majority shareholder, while Uzbek Alisher Usmanov also holds a significant stake. The cash offer for Arsenal would reportedly see the potential investors bid around £20,000 per share, making Kroenke's holding worth £830m, and wipe out the club's £250m debts. A meeting has already been reportedly been requested with the American to discuss the proposed . offer. Another Qatari, Sheik Mansour (middle), is in charge at Arsenal's rivals, Manchester City . David Beckham's new club, Paris St Germain, are also bankrolled by Qataris . It is unlikely Usmanov will want to sell his shareholding, given his . 'dream' of taking control of Arsenal himself, but the Middle East . consortium . believes it will be able to work with the billionaire, who does not . currently have a seat on the board. Any takeover would inevitably raise questions over the future of manager . Arsene Wenger but the Frenchman is understood to be highly-regarded by . the consortium.

For squeamish people and picky eaters the appearance of a rainbow-like sheen on roast beef and processed ham has long been taken as confirmation that the meat is spoiled or tainted. But this commonly held food myth is in fact false. Over the years there has been enough speculation about the safety of rainbow beef that the Department of Agriculture has sought to set the record straight once and for all. Beef Rainbow: The USDA has explained that when light hits a slice of meat it splits into colors like a rainbow it is called 'diffraction grating' and is due to the elements present in the meat . On the USDA website under the heading ‘Iridescent Color of Roast Beef’, this strange phenomenon is explained to be in fact perfectly natural and caused by iron and fat that exists in meats such as roast beef and processed ham. According to the USDA, when light hits a slice of meat it splits into colors like a rainbow due to the elements present in the meat and this is called a ‘diffraction grating’. There are also various pigments in meat . compounds which give it an iridescent or greenish cast when exposed . to heat and processing. The same thing essentially occurs when light waves bend or spread around a surface and create a pattern, such as when the light hits the surface of a DVD. Since the main color created by meat . diffraction gratings is green, perhaps it isn't surprising that many . people have traditionally viewed the color as a sign of spoilage. In . Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham, the character 'Sam I Am' pesters an . unnamed character to taste a dish of green eggs and ham. The unnamed . character declines, claiming to dislike the dish until eventually he . gives in and tries it and discovers he likes it after all. Light waves scattered by the regularly spaced protrusions and microfibrils in the meat send colored light in particular directions . The rainbow on beef is similar to that found on a CD or DVD, while green has traditional been associated as a color of food gone bad through children's book like Green Eggs and Ham . The rainbow effect is most commonly . seen in cooked beef because this is typically sharply sliced against the . grain of the muscle fiber, which, coupled with the moisture in it, . creates an excellent surface for producing rainbows. ‘The . reason it shows up in roast beef is because the cuts of meat that are . used in most roast beef are more prone to iridescence, particularly in . the round,’ Dr. Thomas Powell, Executive Director of the American Meat . Science Association, told The Atlantic. So . the next time you turn your nose up at a cut of beef in your local deli . or that's been in your fridge for a couple of days remember it's . probably fine. The real signs that meat has gone off are if it was slimy . or sticky and have a bad odor. Next time you turn your nose up at a cut of beef in your local deli because you can see a rainbow on it don't worry it's probably fine for you to eat .","USDA sought to set the record straight about the integrity of rainbow beef .

Delight: Prime Minister David Cameron pictured with his wife Samantha and their newborn daughter Florence shortly after her birth at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in 2010 . The surgeon who delivered Prime Minister David Cameron's fourth child, has been allowed to continue working for more than 20 years despite concerns being raised over his performance on more than 20 occasions. Obstetrician and gynaecologist Rob Jones was allowed to continue working despite a series of blunders including the death of a baby in 2010 for which he was attributed blame. The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust is now facing legal action from 60 female patients following a series of serious errors. Mr Jones delivered Samantha Cameron's baby Florence by Caesarian section in 2010 despite an NHS investigation having highlighted his 'significant surgical incompetence' He delivered Mrs Cameron's child at the Royal Cornwall Hospital just seven months after the death of a baby in January 2010 for which he was attributed blame. Colleagues even attempted to prevent him from working alone and warned that patients were being put at risk. Medical director of the NHS, Sir Bruce Keogh, called for public auditing of doctors' performance last night and for them to be properly bound to professional standards. Mr Jones worked for the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust between 1992 and May last year when he was suspended after concerns had been raised about his care on 23 occasions. The 64-year-olds performance was first investigated by the trust in 1997 when hospital chiefs became aware that they had received more complaints against Mr Jones than any of his colleagues. After he was finally suspended when NHS chiefs decided it was unrealistic to retrain him after so many mistakes over such a long period of time, he took himself off the medical register which meant that the General Medical Council could not begin disciplinary measures. Cases against Mr Jones include a hysterectomy that went wrong leaving a patient in pain and needing four more operations to correct the blunder, a baby who died at just two days old from severe brain damage, and a grandmother whose routine surgery went wrong leaving her in agony for ten years. The potential 60 cases of legal action come after the NHS Trust already paid out £9million after a baby was born brain damaged back in 1993 after Mr Jones missed warning signs in the mother's condition. Following an initial investigation into his performance in 1997, he was investigated again in 1998, but Trust bosses decided it was too big a task to examine records after a nurse highlighted 15 cases of concern in 2001. Employer: Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro where obstetrician and gynaecologist Rob jones worked for two decades . He was investigated once more in 2007 and kept his job after persuading the Trust's then medical director to take no action when a review of 45 cases found 'significant surgical incompetence'. College lecturer Carole Gill is planning to take legal action against the trust after her baby daughter Maggie died two days after being born brain damaged in January 2010. Mr Jones and colleagues had failed to spot acute pancreatitis while Miss Gill was pregnant. Visit: Samantha Cameron and daughter Florence pictured on a return visit to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro a year on from her birth in 2011 . He was suspended following that case, but returned to work just a month later. An inquiry of cases involving Mr Jones between 2010 and last year was finally launched after an anonymous letter was sent to Downing Street raising concerns and was passed onto the Trust. That review found that 57 women needed further examination after having been treated by Mr Jones and an extra 52 suffered complications. Of the 57 needing further examination, 50 have since been seen and some are said to be awaiting test results. Almost 70 women were felt to be 'at risk' according to the investigation. A total of 55 complaints have been received since November 2012. He was finally declared unfit to return to work in April last year by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Sir Bruce Keogh said: 'If a doctor doesn't know what the hell he is doing, how can anyone help them or the patients they are treating? 'There is no excuse for any doctor or hospital not to examine performance properly.' Royal Cornwall Hosptials Trust issued an apology to the women and their families for the distress caused and conceded that the concerns over Mr Jones' performance should have been addressed more urgently. Martin Watts, Chairman at RCHT said:' On behalf of the Trust I wish to unreservedly apologise to those women and their families for the pain, distress and anxiety caused by the practice of former Obstetric and Gynaecology Consultant Mr Rob Jones. 'The Independent Organisational Learning Review commissioned by the current Trust Board confirms that concerns identified about some of Mr Jones’ practice should have been addressed with more vigour and urgency. 'We must fully acknowledge the mistakes made – apologise and learn from them – whilst also recognising the significant progress continuing to be made by our dedicated staff to secure better and safer care for the people of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.' The report showed that almost 95 per cent of 2,400 women who Mr Jones cared for since 2010 had no cause for concern. The Medical Defence Union apologised on behalf of Mr Jones to patients who suffered complications. It added that he was only ever made aware of two cases where concerns had been raised about him and that he had co-operated fully with those inquiries. A final Independent Case Note Review Report is expected to be released by the end of the month.","Obstetrician and gynaecologist Rob Jones faces legal action from 60 women .

Retail guru Mary Portas has been branded as a 'Queen of Flops' by critics who say her plans to help struggling high streets are nothing more than 'gimmicks' that have failed. Traders in the seaside resort of Margate in Kent, which won a £100,000 government grant, claim the town's high street is now in a worse state than when she arrived to help, as the Government-appointed 'retail tzar', six months ago. Her plans for the town have included displaying art in abandoned shop fronts. But supporters say Portas has done much to help promote the coastal town, as a bitter war of words casts a cloud over the Queen of Shop's efforts. The row erupted as new figures reveal little of the £1.1million set aside by the Government to reinvigorate high streets across Britain has actually been spent - with Margate using just over £100 of its £100,000 pot. The high street campaigner came under recent fire after it was revealed Dartford Council spent more than £1,000 of its grant money hiring a person in a Peppa Pig costume, as well as nearly £6,000 on newspaper surveys. Scroll down for video . Just 'gimmicks'? Critics claims retail guru Mary Portas has failed to help their high streets . Ghost town: Margate's high street now has a 36.1% vacancy rate . Last May, Margate was one of 12 towns to win a Government grant to help breathe new life into its depressed high street. It was hoped £100,000 would help reclaim the heyday of the mid-1800s, when throngs of Victorian visitors would flock to the seaside town. Today Margate's high street is a much different picture and with a 35.1% vacancy rate, there are few shops left to attract potential customers. So when the Government enlisted Mary Portas to help boost struggling high streets, retailers were no doubt thinking their shop tills would be ringing again in no time. But figures published today in The Sunday Times, under a Freedom of Information Act request by retail expert Paul Turner-Mitchell, show just £111.47 of the £100,000 had been spent on Margate's retailers by December 2012, using a combination of stationery and Land registry searches. The four people who led the original Town Team grant application have all resigned and claim Portas' plans had 'no substance' and she focused her energies on helping the old town and seafront, which have not been as badly effected in the economic downturn. Robin Vaughan-Lyons, who led the bid last year, said: 'It has all been a huge waste of time. It is all gimmicks and no substance, there is nothing real that has been done, not for local people who want to shop in their local shops.' High street spending: The percentage of grants used by 12 winning towns between May and December 2012 . On the beach: Portas has come under fire for focusing on Margate's Old Town, but the retail expert claims she was merely showing what the high street could become . Another trader, Terry Silk, who owns Yama's restaurant, also claims neither the money or the arrival of Portas have done much to change the situation. But the council and the new Town Team say much is being done to help the high street, including plans for community dance studios and steak houses. Richard Ash, who took as chairman of the new Town Team in October, said not spending the money means they still have it for spending on planned projects. He added: 'She [Portas] hasn't done it 100% right, I agree, but she has tried to promote Margate and has brought a lot of publicity.' High hopes: Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Mary Portas as his high street tsar in May 2011 . Margate is not the only town clutching onto its grant. The figures reveal that overall just £161,773, or 14.5% of the £1.11m has been spent. While Margate has only spent 0.1% of the money, both Bedford (4.6%) and Croydon (4.9%) have also spent under 5%. Bedminster spent the most, with 37.7% of the grant allocated to helping its high street. Portas dismissed the claims as 'ridiculous', adding that she filmed Margate's old town as part of her programme series to show what the high street could become. She added: 'There are people who comment, there are people who point and there are people who roll their sleeves up. In rolling my sleeves up, I come [in] for a knocking and I just have to take it but I can sleep at night.'","Government 'retail tzar' Mary Portas comes under fire as traders claim she has failed to reinvigorate Britain's high streets .

An heir to a sprawling country estate has spoken of the moment voices told him to quit his life as a wealthy landowner, shave his head and go to Australia on a spiritual odyssey. Napier Marten gave up the Crichel Estate in Dorset and the £115million family fortune because of a voice 'inside of me saying daily and sometimes many times daily to shave my head and go to Australia.' The 54-year-old spoke of how in 1996 he dropped his former life and travelled to Australia - stopping in Maui to shave his head - because his life of privilege had brought him to a point 'where everything in my life materially was a completely empty shell', reports The Sunday Times. Marten made the revelation in an interview that appeared on Youtube last month. He was talking to equine-assisted psychotherapist Josephine Sellers, a woman he believes he knew in a previous life 400 years ago when he was a priest tutoring her when she was the daughter of a noble Dorset house. He told her: 'Even with small children, I had to leave the house and go pretty much overnight. 'I do recall having a recognition of myself that I was exhibiting some sort of courage, but of course in many other people's minds I was exhibiting some sort of cowardice.' Beauty: The garden at Crichel House. The house itself was featured in the 1996 film Emma, starring Gwyneth Paltrow . Crichel House, part of the Crichel estate, which has been in the same family for 300 years and is worth £100million . While on the trip he shaved his head, a gesture intended as a 'two finger' renunciation of his previous life as a wealthy scion, and went whale watching, an event he found so emotional it left him crying 'almost non-stop' for a week. In Australia he joined a group of Aborigines on top of a cliff and claims to have had an out-of-body experience, where his consciousness was able to observe his own sleeping body. Heritage: Crichel House. The estate also includes four villages, a cricket ground and an ornamental lake . He said: 'I found myself looking down at my sleeping body... the next thing I know, I'm flying out into the ocean into the dark waters and swimming with the whales. It was a complete clearing out, a transmission of energy. 'These days of expansion unfortunately can't be repeated, but when one's in it, it is the most exciting part of your life.' At one point he lived in a lorry and supported himself by working as a chef and later trained in head massage. The 5,000 acre estate, which includes four villages, a cricket club and a lake, will now pass to his elder son Maximilian when he turns 25 in October. The picturesque 18th century manor house was featured in the 1996 film Emma, starring Gwyneth Paltrow. Mr Marten now lives a few miles from the estate and runs a tree surgery firm called Dryad, a name referencing tree spirits from Greek mythology, with his younger son Tobias. He told the paper he had the 'agreement of his family' for his life choices but did not comment further. The Crichel estate was put up for sale after the 2010 death of his mother Mary Marten OBE, goddaughter of the Queen Mother and child playmate of Princess Margaret. It is reportedly worth £100million and comes with 100 workers tied to it and more than 150 other properties.

More than a quarter of a million Bulgarians and Romanians have come to Britain over the past five years – even before the jobs  market is fully opened to them. About half that number were allowed in as farm workers on short-term contracts and thousands more got permanent posts. In total, more than 175,000 National Insurance numbers were handed out to workers from the two countries. The remaining 75,000 people settled here with their families. Scroll down for video . The UK borders will be flung open this year as Romanians and Bulgarians will have access to the job market . Campaigners fear that when work restrictions are lifted next year, further pressure will be placed on the jobs market, housing and public services. Philip Hollobone, Tory MP for Kettering, said: ‘The alarming thing is that even before the borders are flung open, we’re already above a quarter of a million. ‘We’re heading ever closer to my estimate of 425,000 Romanians and Bulgarians, which is a number I simply don’t believe this country can cope with.’ Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union only in 2007 and were not given immediate access to all jobs and services in Britain. But updated statistics published by the Home Office last week show that between 2007 and 2012, a total of 262,929 applications to work or remain in  Britain were approved for Bulgarians and Romanians. MP Philip Hollobone believes the country cannot cope with the number of immigrants expected . In the past year alone, 14,583 permits for the self-employed and 20,842 for fruit-pickers were granted. Some of those permits over the past five years may have gone to the same migrants who return  to work in fields and factories. Separate figures published by the Department for Work and Pensions show the volume of National Insurance numbers handed out to Bulgarians and Romanians is also on the rise. Between 2007 and 2011, there were 176,040 given to workers from the two countries, including a record 40,260 in 2011. Over the same four-year period, 945 Bulgarians and Romanians were forcibly removed from Britain, 139 were refused entry at the border and 64 left voluntarily. Last week it was revealed that 27,725 Romanians had been arrested in London since 2007, even though only 87,000 people from that country live in Britain. A Home Office spokesman said last night: ‘Rather than producing speculative projections, we are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement and addressing the factors that drive European immigration to Britain.’ Meanwhile, the pressure of immigration on public services has been highlighted by new  figures showing that more than 100,000 more primary school places will be needed in England by the next General Election. The total number of places in England stands at just over 4.3 million, but by 2014-15 it is forecast there will be a deficit of 106,807. Some of the biggest gaps are in areas where foreign-born  mothers are driving increases  in the birth rate. In Newham, East London, 4,551 places are needed within three years. In Peterborough – home to the country’s first school where no pupil speaks English as their main language – 2,216 more places are required.","More than 250,000 Romanians and Bulgarians have come to Britain .

Adopted: The millionaire had twice adopted from China - first her daughter, Emily, and then her son, Eric, who she later put up for adoption (stock photo) In December 2004, seven years after her husband died from cancer, Mrs Svenningsen put Emily up for adoption and surrendered her to Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children, an adoption agency in New York. She said that Emily was a difficult child and was unable to bond with the family. But the adoptive family suggest that Christine . may have wanted to terminate Emily's interest in her husband's estate. On May 18, 2006, Maryann Campbell and her husband Fred Cass formally adopted Emily after first expressing interest when Mrs Svenningsen brought Emily to their boarding school catered for children with special needs. Christine placed Emily at the Devereux Glenholme School . based upon a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, though the staff at . Devereux did not concur with that diagnosis, according to court documents, which also noted that Emily thrived with her new family. Land: Christine Svenningsen, who was married to a party-goods magnate, sold Belden Island for $3.95million and Jepson Island for nearly $2million . Private: The islands are part of the Thimble Islands off Branford, which have attracted celebrities and the wealthy for generations . MaryAnn Campbell, left, adopted Emily in 2006. Christine Svenningsen married John G. Chiarella Jr, right, in 2010 . The couple had no idea about the money legally owed to their newly adopted daughter from the trust, but eventually learned that John Svenningsen had arranged to provide for Emily’s educational and medical needs. They were sent a letter by Christine’s lawyers stating that Emily’s trusts totaled $842,397. When they later learned the estate was worth more than $250million, the couple sued on behalf of the Chinese girl. Westchester County Surrogate’s Court said that John Svenningsen meant to provide for all of his children, both biological and adopted. Mrs Svenningsen and her five biological children appealed, but last week the court ruled in Emily's favor. 'It cannot be overly emphasized that Christine’s unilateral surrender of Emily for adoption more than eight years after the decedent and Christine adopted her was not foreseeable at the time the will, and the trust documents were drafted and executed by the decedent,' Judge Leonard Austin wrote. 'John Svenningsen expressed an intention to include his adopted child in the absence of any reason to believe that his status as the parent of Emily would be terminated by her subsequent adoption many years after his death.' Christine Svenningsen, who has since remarried and has spent about $33 million buying ten of the so-called Thimble Islands in the Long Island Sound, could not be reached for comment. She married John G Chiarella, Jr, a landscaping entrepreneur who manages her islands, in July 2010.","Christine Svenningsen had five biological children with late husband .

Britain’s smallest man has been fitted with the world’s smallest hearing aid, it has been claimed. Michael Henbury, the 2ft 11in actor best known as a Harry Potter goblin, has a pair of invisible devices that fit inside the ear canal. He apparently needed a small device because he has tiny eardrums. Mr Henbury, 51, who played an Ewok in Return of the Jedi, as well as his role in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, said he is delighted with the results. He said: 'I suddenly noticed I couldn’t hear very well and in busy rooms I was unable to join in on conversations. Until this point my hearing was fine.' He has been using the Starkey hearing aids, which claim to be the world’s first invisible-in-the-canal instruments, for about a year. 'Nobody even knows I have them in,' said Mr Henbury. 'Once I tell people they are amazed as they can’t even tell. 'I even have to remind myself to take them out at night, they are just fantastic and have made such a difference to my life. 'I couldn’t have anything too complex or big and bulky and I had already been told to rule out any surgery as it would be too risky and difficult. “My height has never really been a huge issue but when I started to experience hearing loss it really began to affect my life and I needed to do something about it. 'It’s ironic as I’m the smallest man in Britain and I’m now wearing the smallest hearing aids available - it’s like they have been designed especially for me!' said Michael. Mr Henbury, who also played an Ewok in Return of the Jedi, said hearing loss had really affected his life . Neil Pottinger from Starkey said: 'Invisible hearing aids have revolutionised the way hearing loss is perceived by millions of people. Hearing aid technology has advanced so much, even if you have a hearing defect nobody even know. For many people these discreet hearing devices are the perfect solution.' Mr Henbury added: 'Without the hearing aids my life would be so different, I would almost definitely have a reduced quality of life and would be unable to hear anything.' Around 2 million people own a hearing aid in the UK, but only 1.4 million people actually use one on a regular basis. Embarrassment of wearing hearing aids is thought to deter some from wearing them.","Harry Potter star Michael Henbury, 51, has a pair of invisible devices that fit inside the ear canal .

Racing driver: Jamie will be competing in a rear-wheel drive Ginetta G40 in the 2013 Ginetta Junior Championship . Jamie, who lives near Tetbury, Gloucestershire, began her motor racing career when she was just 11, in go-karts, but last year beat dozens of 14 to 16-year-olds to win full funding, worth £40,000, for her to race in the 2013 Ginetta Junior Championship.

"Ed Winddancer, 55, changed his name in 1992 . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:39 EST, 29 January 2012 . With his majestic headdress and fearsome warpaint, Ed Winddancer appears to be carrying on the proud traditions of his Native American ancestors - but according to a long-standing enemy, he is nothing but a fraud in feathers. Winddancer, 55, traces his roots to the Nanticoke and Cherokee tribes, and often appears in full  dress at heritage festivals to play the flute, regaling crowds with ancient stories. He sells CDs of his music through his MySpace page. However his performances are now often accompanied by the  presence of Sal Serbin, 48, who has taken to appearing at Winddancer's gigs holding up signs reading 'Liar' and 'Cultural Thief'. Scroll down for video . Tribal calling: Ed Winddancer, 55, from Florida, has caused outrage among the Native American community who declared him a fraud and his practices 'dangerous' Mr Serbin, from Sarasota, Florida, claims that not only is Winddancer a fraud - but his practices are downright dangerous. He told the Herald-Tribune: 'Our ancestors fought and died to . preserve and protect our culture, not for these people to wake up one . day, put some feathers in their hair and decide to be Indian. 'It would dishonor my ancestors if I didn't get out there and do . something.' Mr Serbin, has Sioux lineage and says his grandfather fought in the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876. He said that Winddancer is not alone in his allegedly false claims to be Native American - which is against federal law. Full regalia: Mr Winddancer, 55, performs at the Sarasota Native American Indian Festival in Florida . Mr Serbin had planned to attend the fourth annual Sarasota Indian Festival this weekend in Florida, which he believes is one of the true Native American gatherings. The festival features Rick Bird and the Bird Choppers from Cherokee, North Carolina performing traditional drumming and dance along with craftsmen making authentic bead work, jewellery and sculptures. It is hosted by Rex Begaye, a full-blooded Navajo and Sarasota resident. Protest: Sal Serbin travels up and down Florida outing those who he believes to be fake Native Americans . Mr Winddancer, who also lives in Florida, has not been invited to attend. Mr Serbin, who is a fully fledged member of the Assiniboine Tribe was born on a reservation in Montana. He is married with three children and has lived in Florida for the past 13 years. He is not only angered by Winddancer's . allegedly false practices but worried that they may be placing people in . danger. One ceremony called the Sun Dance, involves a bone being . pierced through a person's chest and tied to a tree, with the individual . moving around until the skin breaks from the bone. He told the Herald-Tribune: 'People are dying from those. It just hasn't gotten a lot of publicity. There's some in Florida.' Mr Serbin travels the state to try to prevent people who he believes to be fraudulent Native Americans from performing rituals. The legitimacy of Ed Winddancer's . heritage is debatable. He was born  Edward Arthur Pielert III in Maryland in 1956 and claims that his mother was of Nanticoke descent, his father of Cherokee. He legally changed his name in 1992 and tours the . country, performing his music and dancing at schools and festivals. Mr Winddancer believes that Mr Serbin's vendetta against him is 'racist'. He said: 'It's racism. What else would you call it? I'm not Indian enough for Sal? Then it's an issue of race.'

Police still searching for the parents of a Texas baby found abandoned in a Walmart bag are exploring whether her rare newborn tooth could help them track down her parents, they said today. Chloe, who was named by hospital staff, was discovered by a dog walker abandoned outside an apartment block in Cypress on February 19. Police have since tried to find the infant's parents and hope the tooth may prove a link to her family history according to ABC News. Smiley: Baby Chloe smiles for the cameras despite coming close to death. She was found dumped in a plastic bag in Texas on February 19 . Abandoned: Child Protective Services are looking for her parents so they know her medical history . An early or natal tooth is seen in . just one in 2000 births and is an extra tooth which is either removed or . goes away before normal baby teeth arrive. Police believe Chloe's mother did not . receive pre-natal care which is why it is proving so difficult to track . her down but say they hope other relatives realize the tooth link and . come forward. Houston police previously released composite sketches of what Chloe's parents could look like in a bid to try and find them. The . pastel renderings created by a forensic sketch artist depict a man and a . woman with facial features combining Chloe's traits, like her grey eyes . and thick dark hair. The . Harris County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that the portraits . are based solely on Chloe's photo and not on the description of any . possible witnesses. Artist Lois Gibson did an age . progression of what Chloe would look like as a young woman to deduce . what her mother and father could look like. ‘It might just look half like one and half like the other,’ Gibson told the Houston Chronicle. 'I think I have a 50 per cent chance of the sketches looking more like one than the other.’ The artist conceded that such factors as weight gain, dyed hair and acne make the process less precise. Gibson, who made it into the 2008 . Guinness Book of World Records as the World's Most Successful Forensic . Artist, has created age progressions in other cases involving children, . but never as young as Chloe. It is believed Chloe, who weighed just four pounds and still had about three inches of umblical cord attached, was premature. She was . naked, but her body temperature was normal, suggesting that she had not . been outside for a long time and someone had cleaned her up after the birth. Content: The newborn has been placed in foster care and a judge will decide her future tomorrow . Mom and dad: An artist created these pastel portraits of what baby Chloe's mother, left, and father, right, might look like using age progression and combining the child's facial features . She was treated and named at Texas Children's Hospital before being released into foster care. 'She was very healthy… didn't have a fever,' Estella Olguin with the Child Protective Services told KHOU. 'Fortunately, she did not suffer from being exposed to the elements . that evening.' Olguin said the parents do not have to claim the baby but that a discussion with them would be useful to identify Chloe's family's medical history. 'So the person who is adopting this baby can have some more genetic . family medical background on the baby to be able to raise her with more . knowledge or information about her,' Olguin said. Tomorrow a hearing will be held to decide whether Chloe should continue in temporary care or the adoption process should begin. Harris County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Christina Garza said . once custody issues are resolved they had no doubt they could settle her into a new home. '[Chloe] will be placed in a loving . home,' she said. 'There is no shortage of people who want her'. Officials with the Harris County . Sheriff's Office Crimes Against Children Unit said they have few leads on the parents as there were no surveillance cameras in the area where she . was abandoned. 'If it had not been for the . resident that came out to walk her dogs, that child may have laid there . all night, possibly would've died,' an officer said. The case was particularly bizarre as Texas has a Safe Haven law which allows anyone to drop off a child with the authoritioes without facing any legal repercussions.","Chloe was found by a dog walker when she was just a few hours old on February 19 .

"By . Jessica Satherley . UPDATED: . 18:28 EST, 7 November 2011 . The mother of the son who vanished after being left in an unlocked car while she went to get gas had previously been cited for leaving a child unattended in a vehicle, according to police. Authorities in Washington state spent a second day today searching for two-year-old Sky Metawala, as court documents emerged revealing his parents had . previously been arrested for leaving their child. Mother Julia Biryukova had also obtained a restraining order against his father last year. She told investigators she left the two-year-old alone on Sunday as she and her four-year-old daughter walked a . mile to a gas station, Bellevue police said. Pictured: Sky Metalwala's mother, Julia Biryukova, told police that she had run out of gas and left the boy buckled into his car seat . Family: Sky Metalwala with his four-year-old sister who went with their mother to look for gas on Sunday morning . When she came back an hour . later, the boy was gone, she said. Investigators searched a 20-block area and even went door to door but found no sign of him. In December 2009, officers in nearby Redmond cited Biryukova and her . husband, Solomon Metalwala, for reckless endangerment for leaving a . child unattended in a vehicle. Details were not immediately available; . police said they were working to redact an incident report for release . under the state's public records act. The case was dismissed early this year after the pair agreed to a year . of probation, 40 hours of community service and a ten-week parenting . class, said Ian Goodhew, a spokesman for the King County Prosecutor's . Office. The couple had been together for 14 years, married since 2003 and . separated in March 2010, court records show. Statement: Julia Biryukova told police that she had run out of gas and left the boy buckled into his car seat only to return an hour later and find him missing . In June 2010, Biryukova, . 30, filed for a protection order on behalf of herself and their two . children, saying Solomon had a severe anger problem, was verbally . abusive and that he had beat her for the first time the previous . Christmas. The reason was that she had allowed Sky – just four months old . at the time – to sleep later than expected, she said. 'He became furious like I have never seen him before, he grabbed me by . my hair in front of our daughter, dragged me into our . hallway, threw me down on the floor and then threw me against a . decorative column we have in the entrance of our home,' Biryukova wrote. 'He continued to assault me with his feet – by kicking me and then he . took out his car keys and contrived to scratch me in any area he could. Missing: Authorities are searching for two-year-old Sky Metalwala, who went missing when his mother left him in the car to search for gas . The abuse escalated after that, with Solomon telling her to go live on the street and work as a prostitute, she said. 'The most, most recent have been his threats to kill me if I say . anything against him or if in any way I proceed with action of seeking . custody of our two small children,' Biryukova added. 'I live in constant . fear for my life and my children's life. Please investigate and help . me!' A man who answered the phone at King Street Kafe and Market, a shop . Metalwala owns in Seattle's Pioneer Square neighborhood, referred calls . to a Leslie Clay Terry III, a lawyer who represented the couple in the . reckless endangerment case. Terry did not immediately return a call . seeking comment. Spokesperson for the Bellevue Police Department, Officer Carla Lafrate, told The Seattle Times: ‘King County felt like they had done a very thorough search of a pretty wide area for the boy and were confident that he wasn’t there.’ The mother told police that as she was walking back to her silver Acura from Chevron gas station a friend picked her up and drove them back to the car. Search team: Police and search dogs were scanning a wooded area in Bellevue, Washington, for the boy . But when they returned, Sky was missing. The door had been left unlocked and there was no sign of forced entry, police said. Officer Lafrate added: ‘We don’t know much, other than the child is still missing. I don’t know if the child got out on his own.’ Sky has been described as having brown eyes and dark buzz-cut hair. He was dressed in a dark-green hooded sweatshirt and blue and grey striped trousers. The case is being treated as a missing child, as they do not know if he was taken or left on his own accord.",Mother Julia Biryukova also obtained restraining order against her husband last year .

In a move designed to make crew 'more responsive', staff are having their bonuses cut unless their work matches pre-agreed customer feedback ratings, some of which are more than 96 per cent. The extreme end of the scale sees junior waiters on a cruise from Southampton earning just £250 a month, with a possible £150 in bonuses, according to the Guardian. Pay package: Crewmembers on P&O ships will have their bonuses withheld unless they meet certain performance targets . Documents seen by the newspaper claim this pay, for 11-hour shifts, seven days a week, represents a 'significantly increased basic salary'. David Dingle, CEO of Carnival UK, the firm in charge of P&O cruises, told the Guardian that customers were 'reluctant to pay the recommended level of tipping', claiming the move had made crew 'much happier.' He said: 'You've got staff from eastern Europe in restaurants in Britain – why? Because it's great money. 'Yes, the minimum wage is more than we pay, but this is a global industry, Our businesses have to remain competitive. P&O boss DAvid Dingle defended the pay move, saying it has made crew 'much happier' 'Let's not forget the level of take-home pay for our staff, the vast majority of whom come from India. Look at hotels in Goa. The earning ability is greater on our ships.' Many restaurants have already phased out cash tipping in favour of electronic tips which are automatically added to customers' bills. However, P&O bosses have opted to remove the risk of tips not being paid by paying bonuses if targets are met. Mr Dingle said the new measures have . been handled 'fairly and decently' to make sure staff pay is protected, . but the move is likely to attract criticism for the treatment of already . low-earning crewmembers. The new system will see bonus payments withheld if performances do not match certain customer feedback ratings.

The Queen’s visit to Italy planned for later this week is in doubt after she cancelled a public engagement yesterday because of illness. She had been due to attend  St David’s Day celebrations in Wales, but pulled out after being diagnosed with gastroenteritis. The Queen, who is 86, and the Duke of Edinburgh are scheduled  to visit Rome from Wednesday  to Thursday. Strong: Her Majesty has always refused to fuss over a string of ailments over recent years . A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the trip was still due to take place, but a final decision would be made after the Queen was assessed by doctors. A spokeswoman earlier confirmed that the Queen was spending the weekend resting at Windsor after being laid low with the stomach bug. The monarch was due to attend a military celebration in Swansea on Friday as part  of the city’s St David’s Day celebrations. The Queen, 86, was due to spend three hours a meeting soldiers and their families before a lunch at the George Hall. She had also planned to present St David’s Day leeks to members of 3rd Battalion The Royal Welsh Regiment. The ceremony continued in her absence, but was carried out by the Lord Lieutenant of West Glamorgan, Byron Lewis. The Queen has rarely taken time off due to illness during her six decades as monarch. She is normally in robust health and is known not to make a fuss in times of sickness or discomfort. She has, however, suffered occasional problems with her back. In October, she was forced to cancel an appearance at a Windsor Castle investiture ceremony, and also had to miss a church service in Scotland a few days earlier. Host: The Queen was well enough to award Jessica Ennis a CBE and Nicola Adams an MBE at the Investiture ceremony on Thursday, but has since taken a turn for the worse . In 2006, she suffered a strain to her . back during her annual summer break at Balmoral which led to her . cancelling a tour of Arsenal’s new stadium. She also missed a visit to the British Museum in October 2011 because of a bad cold. Disappointed locals took to Twitter to voice their upset at the change of plans for Swansea. Becca . Masters commented ‘poor Queenie’ while Peter Grant added ‘Get well soon . your Majesty!’ June Marcroft added: ‘Jeez, she’s human after all, I thought she was bionic.’ Honoured: Olympic cycling coach David Brailsford received a Knighthood at The Queen's Investiture ceremony . Leaders: Although the Queen has suffered various illness and injury in recent years, it is the health of Prince Philip that is more often in the spotlight . The Queen’s most recent appearance was . to present a host of Olympic stars with honours during an investiture . ceremony at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. Gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and bowel, with common symptoms including vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration. In England, the two most common causes . of gastroenteritis in adults are the norovirus and food poisoning, . according to NHS Choices. In June, the Duke of Edinburgh . succumbed to a bladder infection thought to be brought on after being . forced to stand for several hours in cold, wet and windy conditions on a . barge sailing down the Thames during the Jubilee River Pageant. The 91-year-old was taken into . hospital just hours  before the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee’s closing . celebrations at Buckingham Palace,  where she was joined by some 12,000 . people. The illness forced him to miss several other key events, including a service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral. Gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and bowel and is very common in England, with about one in five people affected every year. The two most common causes in adults are a virus, such as the norovirus, or food poisoning, according to NHS Choices. The infection interferes with one of the main functions of the intestines, the absorption of water from the contents of the intestines into the body. Common symptoms of gastroenteritis include vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration. Most types of gastroenteritis are highly infectious, and bacteria can be transferred through poor hygiene, such as not washing your hands after going to the toilet. Viruses and bacteria on hands can be transferred to whatever they touch, such as a glass, kitchen utensil or food. Most people with gastroenteritis only have mild symptoms and the infection passes after a few days without the need for treatment. But sufferers may need treatment in hospital if symptoms are severe or if they are vulnerable because of their age or another illness. This is because diarrhoea can quickly cause dehydration which, if severe, can be fatal. Each year in England and Wales, an average 190 deaths occur because of gastroenteritis. Most deaths are in people over 65.

Big names from the Royal Academy have teamed up with celebrity mothers to create art that will be sold in aid of the children’s cancer charity Joss Searchlight. Lord Foster, Sir Ian Ritchie, Sonia Lawson and Brendan Neiland have joined Sophie Conran, Patsy Palmer and Kim Wilde - as well as over 100 contemporary artists - to make a series of paintings, sculptures and prints. The artworks will be auctioned on the March 14th at a free public event in Blackall Studios, London, with every penny raised funding support, specialist equipment and money-can’t-buy gifts and experiences for families living with children diagnosed with cancer. Sophie Conran felt particularly compelled to support this charity as she nearly lost her daughter when she was a week old to meningitis so created this 'tree of life', she was joined by many celebrities in creating artwork . Joss Searchlight is named after Joss Parkes, who died in 2011 after battling brain cancer for six years. Joss was only four years old when he was diagnosed. Joss’s mother Dianne founded the charity after her son’s death in an attempt to help other families suffering from the disease. Kim Wilde's painting is of her niece, Willow and she says she is personally very moved by the charity . 'Joss painted everything: paper, shells, stones, bottles and he used lots of glue and glitter too,' she said. 'Before his diagnosis all the mess may have been mildly irritating, but after, his every creation was magical. Towards the end of his life, art gave voice to his feelings and to his ambitions.' Pop singer turned TV presenter Kim Wilde said: 'What mother couldn’t be moved to help in some way. 'My painting is of my niece, Willow. I have hidden her name in the painting. Willow was concentrating on a book at the time which explains her serious expression.' Speaking about the bronze sculpture Sophie Conran made, she said: 'I wanted to create something beautiful and delicate to illustrate the tiny and fragile nature of a child’s brain. Patsy Palmer also designed some artwork for Joss Searchlight, which is named after Joss Parkes, who died in 2011 after battling brain cancer for six years . 'I felt particularly compelled to support this wonderful charity as I nearly lost my daughter when she was a week old to meningitis, an illness also affecting the brain.' Dianne explained: 'By creating Joss Searchlight, we aim to show random acts of kindness with toy hampers, entertainment equipment and family breaks to show families living with childhood cancer that they have our on-going support and friendship. 'We want them to know that good times can still be accomplished and we want to give the whole family some amazing memories to cling to. 'We also created the Joss Searchlight website as a source of information where parents can search for practical and financial help. Children's book illustrator Korky Paul also sketched something for the sale, which is called Something Special and will be conducted by Tom Best of Christie's . 'Many parents are already hugely appreciative of our work and say that it is a comfort to know that there are people here who will listen and who will understand. 'Most children with a brain tumour are not fortunate to live six years, so when a family gets in contact we make sure we act quickly and respond to their needs.'

When Te'o hugged Ronaiah, he reportedly thought he was meeting the 'favorite cousin' of his online girlfriend Lennay Kekua. Ronaiah was later revealed as the man who allegedly posed as Lennay on Facebook and Twitter and lured Te'o into a long-distance relationship. It was claimed on Thursday that Ronaiah developed 'intense feelings' for Te'o during the fake encounter. Te'o says he never knew his girlfriend was actually a man - even though they talked on the phone. Scroll down for video . Face-to-face: This is the only time Notre Dame star Manti Te'o met his 'girlfriend.' He was in fact hugging Ronaiah Tuiasos, who allegedly posed as Lennay Kekua online . Unawares: Te'o, right, reportedly believed that Ronaiah was his girlfriend's 'favorite cousin.' Ronaiah is claimed to have developed intense feelings for Te'o as a result of the hoax relationship . TMZ reports that as a result of the the long-distance relationship that Ronaiah developed with Te'o while he was pretending to be Lennay, he channeled most of his emotions through the online female alter-ego. The video was shot on November 24 as Te'o was leaving the Los Angeles Coliseum after his team's victory against the University of Southern California. Te'o admitted to Katie Couric during his first televised interview today that he only learned the Lennay Kekua was not real on December 6. He admitted he lied about his girlfriend, who he was told died of cancer following a car crash, in two December interviews. The revelation earlier this month that Te'o's relationship with Lennay was a hoax rocked the college football world. The pictures that Ronaiah allegedly used for Kekua's online persona are actually photos of Diane O'Meara, a 23-year-old marketing manager in Los Angeles. She says she had no connection with Te'o or Ronaiah. Hoax: Manti Te'o (left), who was a runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, says he was duped by Ronaiah Tuiasosopo (right) - who played the online persona of Lennay Kekua until revealing the hoax on December 6 . Grilling: Katie Couric questioned why Te'o didn't come clean about the hoax after he learned of it on December 6. She also asked if he was covering up for being gay . Te'o's story of perseverance in the face of tragedy came the stuff of legend for the University of Notre Dame - whose football program is built on seemingly mythical characters. During his interview with Couric on Thursday, the talk show house brought up the possibility that Te'o may have been involved in a sexual affair and made up girlfriend 'Lennay Kekua' as a cover. She then asked the football star point blank: 'Are you gay?' Cracking a smile, Te'o responded: 'No. Far from it. Far from it.' Pretty face: Photos of Diane O'Meara, 23, were stolen to play the face of Lennay Kekua. She says she never met Te'o or the alleged hoaxer Ronaiah . Te'o also vehemently denied any involvement in the hoax, saying that he believed Kekua was dead until he received a mysterious phone call on December 6 saying that she had not died of leukemia as he had believed. Pressed by Couric to admit that he was in on the deception, Te'o said he believed Kekua had died from the cancer. 'You stuck to the script. And you knew that something was amiss, Manti,' the talk show host said. He replied: 'Katie, put yourself in my situation. I, my whole world told me that she died on September 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I committed myself to, died on September 12.' The Heisman Trophy runner-up said he only learned of the hoax when he received a phone call in early December from a woman saying she was Kekua. Te'o told Couric: 'From December 6 to January 16, my whole reality is that she was dead and she was suddenly alive.' It wasn't until Deadspin.com reported the hoax that he finally learned the truth. He said he had 'known' Kekua though Twitter and Facebook and he was drawn to her by the fact that she was Polynesian, loved her faith and 'knew a lot' about his Mormon beliefs. The interview took an emotional turn as he was joined by his parents Brian and Ottilia. Speaking of the day they learned of the ruse - Christmas - his mother told Couric: 'It took (Manti) a while to say it. He said ""Lennay's alive. It came as a complete and utter shock.""' She added: 'The deception wasn’t only with Manti. It was our family.'","Manti Te'o believed he was meeting his girlfriend Lennay Kekua's 'favorite cousin' when he hugged Ronaiah Tuisospo .

Terry Fearns was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison but is allowed out on day-release each week to play football for Skelmersdale United . A non-league footballer jailed for his role in a cross-border drugs operation is being freed from prison on day-release to play football. Police found £30,000 of heroin destined for the streets of Merseyside and Scotland when they raided Terry Fearns' Maghull home in 2009. Sentenced last year to four years and eight months in HMP Kirkham, an open prison near Preston, the former Southport FC striker is being let out each week to turn out for Skelmersdale United. The 33-year-old, who pleaded guilty to supplying Class A drugs, cut and packaged the heroin for sale as part of a 12-strong drugs gang. Yet despite serving less than half of his sentence Fearns, who was also a builder before he was jailed, has taken advantage of a scheme to re-integrate offenders into society. Fearns, who also played for Wigan Athletic's youth team, is due to be freed next September. Paul Griffiths, chairman of Skelmersdale United FC, defended the decision to sign Fearns, who scored on his Skelmersdale debut. He said: 'He [Fearns] is a guy who deserves a second chance and if the Home Office and Prison Service are happy to give him a second chance then we are OK to give the lad a second chance.' Fearns is set to be released from HMP Kirkham next September . Skelmersdale United manager Tommy Lawson refused to comment.

Instead, the criminals will be . offered electronic cigarettes or nicotine patches to satisfy their . cravings but there are concerns this might not . be enough and that some will react angrily to the ban. With more than eight out of ten prisoners smoking there is also a belief . contraband cigarettes could become valuable currency behind bars.

'That . has always been the aim since the Government's smoke-free legislation . came into effect in 2007. Smoking has been a huge concern among staff, . who feel they are unfairly exposed to it. 'But you have to fear for them when this does come in because it is unlikely to go down very well with the inmates.'

Prisoners . escaped the smoking ban due to a legal loophole which allowed cells to . be designated 'permanent or temporary homes', but this is now set to be . scrapped.

He argues that the pressure they feel put under when young could cause 'long term damage'. The £30,000 a year Uppingham school prides itself on producing students that excel at university . In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph he said that the current approach 'may get short-term results but risk long-term damage.' He added: 'Good exam scores are important but the hothouse atmosphere and the paranoia that can create can be damaging. Richard Harman has said that he believes children must be prepared for the failures and disappointments of life, not just to pass exams . 'Instead of focusing on results, schools and parents must help children handle failure, develop different strengths and become resilient people who can make relationships with others because that is what brings proper happiness in life-long terms.' Harman also argued that outside worries, such as the economic climate and shrinking job market were causing pupils to panic and that they needed help to cope with it. Harman, who is taking over as leader of the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference next year, added that: 'the entire social life of some London parents is consumed by whether or not their children is going to get into the school of their choice. 'They put their children through seven, eight or nine entrance tests. There is paranoia and a pressure that is just unhealthy for parents as well as their children.' Uppingham school was founded in 1584, and boasts that its first pupil, Henry Ferne became chaplain to Charles I. Other famous pupils include world water speed record holder Donald Campbell, Carphone Warehouse multi-millionaires Charles Dunstone and David Ross, TV personality Stephen Fry, Charlie Simpson of pop band Busted, and Harry Judd of pop band McFly.","Headmaster Richard Harman thinks students are under too much pressure .

It's just nowhere near as good as it should have been. Set after the events of Aliens, you play Corporal Winter, part of a U.S.S. Marine Corp battalion sent to investigate the goings-on at the USS Sulaco and LV-426. On venturing inside the iconic ship, you’ll see the severed remains of the Bishop android on the flight deck and walk through the changing rooms used by the original marines, complete with their personal lockers. If there is something Colonial Marines excels at, it’s fan service. Stand and deliver: There is some attempt to capture the aliens' behaviour, however, their movement is so clunky that it just doesn't look convincing . Sadly, it’s impossible to ignore just how dated the game looks. There's a blue foggy haze that swamps any larger expanses and textures range from the muddy to the non-existent. Look past the visuals, and the gameplay holds up slightly better, albeit still flawed. The main drawback comes in the bizarre decision to include a motion-tracker prompt at the bottom of the screen. This emits the iconic ‘beep’ when an enemy is near, reminding you to check the device for its distance from you. This cancels out any kind of tension and reduces the repetitive and linear levels into nothing more than glorified shooting galleries. The decision, too, to pit the marines against human foes (Weyland Industries' mercs), just ‘feels’ wrong and jars with the entire universe. However, things do improve as the game goes on. There’s a genuine thrill of setting up a perimeter around the control room in Hadley's Hope and a tense (if slightly scripted) part where you have to sneak past blind aliens who are drawn to noise. Indeed, the different species of Xeno, bravely introduced by Gearbox, are themselves very well designed and respect the source material - ranging from agile Lurkers to boil-ravaged monstrosities and smaller beasts that spit acid at you. It's a shame, then, that their movement and AI is not quite there. Xenos will clumsily stroll past other marines and make a beeline for you, which is of particular annoyance given how unhelpful your teammates can be. They'll often unload whole clips at walls and tables, or comically run away, leaving you to fend for yourself. Watch my back: Colonial Marines is best played with friends, with many levels requiring you to provide cover while your teammate hacks or cuts through a door . It's for this reason that Colonial Marines is best played with friends - and thankfully, multiplayer is where the game shines. Cooperative can be played via system link, locally via split screen or over the internet. It completely changes the experience, and while you won't have any shocks or scares, shooting is done well enough to instill a real sense of comradery  - much to Gearbox's credit. The repetitive dark surroundings and monster closets are much easier to ignore, making the whole thing feel like a sci-fi Left 4 Dead. There are also plenty of competitive modes - which see marines take on a team of aliens. Both sides have their own strengths and weaknesses, meaning battles are often a tactical game of cat and mouse. Survivor mode, where a team of marines has to stay alive while Xenos hunt them down, is a particular highlight. Given the six year wait, many would have expected more from Colonial Marines. But while it's not the classic it could have been, it's a respectable stop-gap until that day finally arrives. WATCH THE VIDEO REVIEW HERE: .

The Duchess of Cambridge has proved that her pregnancy is not slowing her down as she enjoys a winter break in the Swiss Alps. But rather than get her skis on, Kate seemed to opt for a bit of sledging instead. Kate was pictured chatting to friends, including one carrying a baby, as she pulled a wooden sledge along the slopes of the luxury Arosa resort. Dressed in black trousers and boots, a brown jacket and wearing shades in the bright winter sunshine, the royal could later be seen mingling as skiers got kitted out for the day. On the go: The Duchess looked relaxed as she pulled a sledge during a walk with friends at the Arosa resort in Switzerland . Active: The Duchess of Cambridge showed her pregnancy is not slowing her down as she mingles with skiers in the snow . Despite being an ardent fan of the sport, the Duchess appeared to opt for a gentle walk rather than getting her skis on. Skiing is listed by the NHS as one of the sports to avoid when pregnant because of the risk of falling. Kate, who is about four months pregnant, was first seen skiing with William in Switzerland in 2004, and they had they also had their first photographed kiss there two years later. Kate and Prince William are in Switzerland to attend the wedding of their friends polo player Mark Tomlinson to Olympic dressage gold medallist Laura Bechtolsheimer. Prince Harry was also a guest at the society wedding. While all eyes were focussed on the happy couple, the young royals acted as any other guest and chatted happily in the background.

On the slopes: Kate kept warm in black trousers and comfy boots and wore a snug looking brown jacket. She also wore shades in the bright winter sun . Relaxing: Kate enjoyed some food during the mini-break for the wedding of her English polo professional Mark Tomlinson and Olympian Laura Bechtolsheimer . With the world eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Royal baby, Kate has been getting plenty of opportunity to relax recently. Last . month, Prince William and Kate enjoyed a break in a sumptuous villa on . one of the most exclusive paradise islands in the world. The happy couple took a ‘babymoon’ break in a luxury £5 million house on Mustique. Nestled amid lush tropical gardens, . with dramatic views of the aquamarine Caribbean waters lapping a . tranquil white-sand beach, the five-bedroom house would normally have . cost about £19,000 a week to rent. Happy: Prince William, his pregnant wife Kate and Prince Harry attended the wedding of Mark Tomlinson and Laura Bechtolsheimer during a break at an upmarket ski resort in Switzerland . It was not known whether the . multi-millionaire owners, who are close friends of both the Royal couple . and the wider Middleton family, charged them for the stay. The . dream home was furnished with Oriental antiques and came with a staff . of six servants, who oversee such amenities as a private cinema, gazebo . and 64 ft infinity pool. During the lavish trip, the Duchess was seen every day at the tennis courts on the privately owned island. Snow white wedding: The royals' delight was evident as they sat in the congregation alongside other guests at the society wedding . Married: The bride, Laura Bechtolsheimer and her husband Polo player Mark Tomlinson leave the church in a horse-drawn carriage . Fun: Kate flung a handful of confetti into the air as the newlyweds walked past following the ceremony in a bright and sunny Switzerland on Saturday . However, she was cheering from the sidelines rather than playing, as she has done on previous trips. ‘They’re having a very quiet, peaceful holiday, which is just what Kate needed,’ a long-time island resident said. ‘I’d heard they were planning to . leave on Thursday but that they are enjoying themselves so much, they . may stay until after Valentine’s Day.’ The . couple were joined by the Duchess’s sister Pippa, brother James and . parents, Carole and Michael. The Middletons rented accommodation nearby . to give the couple some privacy. Royal . links to Mustique go back to 1960, when Princess Margaret was given a . ten-acre estate there. The Queen and Prince Philip have also made . several visits to the island. With Kate snug in a cream woollen coat and a smart chocolate brown hat, and husband William decked out in tails, the pair looked more than happy to be in attendance at their friends' nuptials, in spite of the brisk temperatures.

Drop: Private sector wages in Europe have fallen faster than almost everywhere else in Europe . Wages in Britain have fallen faster than almost everywhere else in Europe, analysis shows. Private sector pay dropped 3.2 per cent between autumn 2010 and autumn last year after taking account of inflation, it found. Only the Netherlands, Cyprus and Greece fared worse. The analysis by the House of Commons Library for the Labour Party used UK figures and those of EU statistics arm Eurostat. It bears out recent Eurostat findings that UK living standards are falling. The figures show German private sector wages have gone up by 2.4 per cent since 2010 and those in Austria by 2.3 per cent. Sweden and the Czech Republic saw gains of 3.4 and 3.3 per cent respectively. The biggest improvements were in Bulgaria and Romania, up by 12.2 per cent and 5.8 per cent. However the two newest European countries continue to have the lowest pay levels in the EU, and the increased standards do nothing to change the 'pull factor' of wealth western economies like that of Britain to their workers when their citizens acquire freedom to work in Britain next year. These figures show just how far Britain is falling behind the rest of Europe under this government. Late last year an official analysis found that the amount a typical household is able to pay to cover all its necessities and luxuries has dropped by nearly 10 per cent since the onset of the recession. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: 'We are losing in the global race. Families, pensioners and businesses cannot afford another two years of falling living standards. 'A flatlining economy under David Cameron . and George Osborne over the last two years has made British people . worse off, but families, pensioners and businesses cannot afford another . two years of falling living standards.' 'Flatlining': Chancellor George Osborne is coming under increasing pressure over the economy . He added: 'Urgent action is needed in the Budget to kick-start our stagnant economy and help people on middle and low incomes struggling with the rising cost of living. 'Stagnant': Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said 'urgent action is needed' 'David Cameron and his downgraded . Chancellor must heed the warnings and act or Britain will face more . years of falling living standards and more long-term damage to its . economy.' Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to take measures to improve growth in his Budget later this month, and there is a growing backbench demand for tax cuts. However, ministers are now squabbling publicly over whether the spending of their departments should be cut. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond called this weekend for cuts to . benefits and welfare spending to protect defence from further . sacrifices. The figures underline the deepening pressure on ordinary families brought by the recession and the Coalition's inability to improve living standards. They will deepen David Cameron's troubles in the aftermath of the disastrous Tory performance in the Eastleigh by-election and the fractured response to it of Tory figureheads. Late last year an official analysis found that the amount a typical household is able to pay to cover all its necessities and luxuries has dropped by nearly 10 per cent since the onset of the recession. An average home in Britain had almost £50 a week less to spend last year than it did in 2006, once inflation has been taken into account, according to that breakdown from the Office for National Statistics.","Only the Netherlands, Cyprus and Greece fared worse in 2010-11 .

But the master of reinvention enjoyed instant success yesterday after releasing a new single on the internet. Where Are They Now? appeared for sale on iTunes at 5am and by the end of the day had topped its chart. The song’s video had also been viewed 200,000 times on YouTube. David Bowie, the original Young Dude, . dispelled rumours yesterday that his career was over with an . out-of-the-blue release on his 66th birthday of his first new single in a . decade. But for many fans, the relief that . the iconic singer-songwriter still has all his creative faculties gave . way, after the first couple of bars, to sadness. For millions – me included – Bowie had . once been the most exciting pop star of his generation; now, judging by . his new single, he has dwindled to little more than a pale echo of his . Seventies glory days. Scroll down to watch . Back on the scene: David Bowie celebrated his 66th birthday on Tuesday by releasing new track Where Are We Now? on iTunes, while new album The Next Day will be available from March . New video: The release of single Where Are We Now coincided with a video by David Oursler, which shows the musician's face projected onto the body of a puppet . The four-and-a-half minute song, Where Are We Now?, appeared on his website without forewarning or fanfare early yesterday morning. The only publicity was a single message on Twitter, inviting his followers to ‘stumble upon ... a well-kept secret’. Within minutes, the news had travelled . across the world, spread by the chattering of social media websites. It . seems the man who once, as an unknown rocker in 1972, hired a platoon . of bodyguards to make himself look like a megastar on tour in America, . has learned to appreciate the effectiveness of understatement. The surprise of fans and critics was . all the greater because many thought the singer, still most famous for . his Ziggy Stardust incarnation 40 years ago, had been brought low by . illness and advancing years. Legend: The video pays homage to the time Bowie spent in Berlin . Following a heart attack on stage in . 2004, Bowie has turned down all invitations to play live, even refusing . to attend the Olympics opening ceremony last August, where his 1977 song . Heroes practically became the anthem to a summer of sporting success. A photograph taken on a New York . street in October, close to his apartment, showed a frail man, shuffling . along in a flat cap and sweatshirt, clutching a paper bag that appeared . to contain his lunch. It sparked fears the former drug addict and chain . smoker was suffering from cancer or perhaps dementia. The new single at least reassures us . he retains his poetic gift. In one poignant line he calls himself, ‘a . man lost in time, just walking the dead’. With its stark piano chords and . echoing drums, the single sounds like an out-take from his . late-Seventies albums, which were recorded in Berlin, where he escaped . in an attempt to recover from his cocaine addiction. He's back: The new track is produced by long-term collaborator Tony Visconti and written by Bowie . Breaking the silence: The unusual video pays reference to the time Bowie spent in Berlin, Germany, in the late 70s . The video which accompanies the single . emphasises the Berlin connection, with grainy footage of the German . capital projected on to a screen in a cluttered basement. In front of . the flickering pictures of deserted streets and grimy statues, Bowie’s . heavily-lined face materialises on a teddy bear, alongside the face of a . woman set on another bear. Yesterday internet chatter suggested . that the woman may be the Icelandic singer Bjork, who performed at . Bowie’s 50th birthday party in 1997. Others have intimated that she may . be Coco Schwab, Bowie’s longtime personal assistant, or even the painter . Jacqueline Humphries, wife of the video’s director Tony Oursler. If there’s a message hidden in the . eerie video, we probably won’t be able to decipher it until the album – . The Next Day – goes on sale in March. Although little is known about the . album, the titles of the songs have been released to whet the appetites . of fans: You Will Set The World On Fire, Dirty Boys, Dancing Out In . Space. Comeback: David Bowie is releasing his first single and album in a decade . Boy George: 'Bowie's new song has made me cry! Happy tears of course!' Graham Coxon: 'So is Bowie goin back to blonde hair and pegs or that bugs bunny thing he's been vockink for a while #bugsbowie.' Nikki Sixx: 'Happy 66th birthday to one of my all time musical hero's David Bowie.' Jo Whiley: 'BOWIE IS BACK . THIS IS VERY VERY EXCITING NEWS!!!' Piers Morgan: 'Love this new David Bowie song...  still the classiest guy in world music. Great to have him back.' Jonathan Ross: 'He'll yeah! Welcome back David! DavidBowie!!!!!' Alastair Campbell: 'David Bowie showing it's possible to be 66 and young. Great song.' Legend: The star achieved success in the US in the mid 70s and scored a string of number one singles in the UK throughout the 80s, before experimenting with a series of musical styles in the 90s . Glam rocker: Bowie hasn't released an album since Reality in 2003, while his last single to grace the charts was a cover of Pink Floyd track Arnold Lane David Gilmour in 2006 . Bowie’s son, the film director Duncan . Jones (christened Zowie Bowie) tweeted yesterday, ‘First in ten years, . and its a good ‘un!’ But his enthusiasm may not be matched by all of his . father’s many fans. Those titles appear to have been . chosen by a random Bowie song generator: an all too recognisable . combination of his most hackneyed phrases borrowed from hits like: Boys . Keep Swinging, Space Oddity, Let’s Dance and The Man Who Sold the World. Bingo! Instant Bowie. There will, of course, be a round of . forced smiles and hearty reviews from middle-aged critics who grew up . with the classic vinyl LPs: in other words, lifelong fans like me. It’ll . be the same respectful applause and worn-out praise that greeted new . albums last year from Paul Simon and Bob Dylan, and concerts given by . Bruce Springsteen and the Rolling Stones. ‘They’ve still got it!’ we . cry, willing ourselves to believe it. But the truth is the new music of . these rock dinosaurs isn’t a patch on the life-changing sounds that . re-mapped popular culture the first time around. How could it be? Famous fan: Comedian David Walliams joked around about Bowie's return . Catch up: Actor Stephen Fry didn't hear the news until Tuesday afternoon . Fan: TV presenter Piers Morgan is clearly a fan of the veteran pop star . Model behaviour: Bowie married second wife, supermodel Iman, in 1992 . When Ziggy Stardust strutted on to Top . Of The Pops in 1972, pouting into the camera and slinging an arm around . his lead guitarist like they were lovers, the country was torn in two – . one generation was disgusted, another inspired. Bowie’s sexuality was so incendiary . that the video for Life On Mars, a sustained shot (innocuous by today’s . standard’s) panning across his heavily made-up face, was banned by the . BBC that same year. The extreme, sexualised androgyny of Bowie’s make-up . was deemed too shocking for television. What is the most extreme reaction that . his latest release could provoke? Mild interest, melancholy for lost . youth, nostalgia for the faded thrill of old songs. First wife: Bowie married Mary Angela Barnett in March 1970, pictured in 1974 with their son Duncan, before divorcing 10 years later in 1980 . 'A wonderful father': Bowie and his son, film director Duncan . It would have been far better if he’d . done something else – anything, apart from revisiting the Seventies. A . novel, a collection of poems, a movie role, a website, just something . that didn’t sully his musical legacy. This new song seems a sad . admission that his imagination has finally run out. Could Beatle John Lennon ever have . matched his greatest work – Imagine, or Help!, or Strawberry Fields – . had he lived? By 1980 he was already making the most lacklustre music of . his life, with songs like Double Fantasy. Sir Paul McCartney meanwhile, has . tried endlessly to recreate the glory of earlier days, without ever . coming close. The same goes for all the ageing giants. Glory days: David Bowie, seen performing as Ziggy Stardust in the 1970s, shocked fans with the release of a new single ahead of his first album in a decade . Still the old acts drag on. Hoary . warhorses like Dylan and Springsteen continue their overpriced, . never-ending tours playing old songs in new ways that no one much likes, . or making hearts sink with that ghastly phrase: ‘Here’s one from our . new album ...’ But no one ever sings the new songs in the shower, and no cover band plays them in the pub on a Friday night.

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 09:29 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:51 EST, 1 March 2013 . New research using brain scans sheds light on the way that the Rain Man's remarkable brain worked. Scientists at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley combined hospital MRIs with a mathematical tool called network analysis to make 3D maps of the brains of seven adults who have the same condition. These 'structural connectome' maps, described in the upcoming April 15 issue of the journal Neuroimage, reveal new details about the condition known as agenesis of the corpus callosum. Immortalised on the silver screen: Tom Cruise, left, and Dustin . Hoffman, right, in a frame from the Hollywood film Rain Man, which was . based on Kim Peek, a famous sufferer of agenesis of the corpus callosum . This is where genetic malformations leave patients without a corpus callosum, the neurological structure that connects the left and right sides of the brain. That condition is one of the top genetic causes of autism and was part of the mysterious brain physiology of Laurence Kim Peek, the remarkable savant portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the 1987 movie Rain Man. Mr Peek, from Utah, who died in 2009 aged 58, was known as a 'megasavant' for his exceptional memory, but he also experienced significant social difficulties. He could speed through a book in about an hour and remember almost everything he had read, memorising vast amounts of information in subjects ranging from history and literature, geography and numbers to sports, music and dates. But while his amazing memory emerged as early as 16 months, he could not walk until the age of four, could not button up his own shirts and scored a below-average 87 on general IQ tests. While some people born with agenesis of the corpus callosum are of normal intelligence and do not have any obvious signs of neurologic disease, approximately 40 per cent of people with the condition are at high risk for autism. Megasavant: Kim Peek, who in 2009, could speed through a book in about an hour and remember almost everything he had read but could not button up his own shirts and scored a below-average 87 on general IQ tests . Given this, the work is a step toward finding better ways to image the brains of people with the condition, said Dr Pratik Mukherjee, a professor of radiology and biomedical imaging at UCSF. Understanding how brain connectivity varies from person to person may help researchers identify imaging biomarkers for autism to help diagnose it and manage care for individuals. Currently autism is diagnosed and assessed based on cognitive tests, such as those involving stacking blocks and looking at pictures on flip cards. While the new work falls short of a quantitative measure doctors could use instead of cognitive testing, it does offer a proof-of-principle that this novel technique may shed light on neurodevelopment disorders. 'Because you are looking at the whole brain at the network level, you can do new types of analysis to find what's abnormal,' Dr Mukherjee said. Different brain structures: Example midline sagittal and coronal colour fractional anisotropy (FA) images for a control subject with a normal brain and a patient suffering from agenesis of the corpus callosum . Agenesis of the corpus callosum can arise if individuals are born missing DNA from chromosome 16 and often leads to autism. Scientists have long puzzled over what the link is between this disorder and the autistic brain,  especially since not all people with this malformation develop autism, said Dr Elliott Sherr, professor of neurology and genetics. Doctors believe this is because the brain has a rich capacity for rewiring in alternative ways. Pursuing this question, Dr Mukherjee and Dr Sherr turned to MRI and the mathematical technique of network analysis, which has previously been used by urban planners to optimise the timing of traffic lights to speed traffic. The researchers believe their study is the first to apply network analysis to brain mapping for a genetic cause of autism. Network analysis: These structural connectome maps show the differences in brain wiring between three subjects with agenesis of the corpus callosum and three subjects with normal brains . The brain offers a significantly complicated challenge for analysis because, unlike the streets of a given city, the brain has hundreds of billions of neurons. Many of these make tens of thousands of connections to each other, making its level of connectivity highly complex. By comparing the seven rain man-like brains to those of 11 people without this malformation, the scientists determined how particular structures called the cingulate bundles were smaller and the neurons within these bundles were less connected to others in the brain. They also found that the network topology of the brain was more variable in people with agenesis of the corpus callosum than in people without the malformation. Dr Mukherjee and Dr Sherr are senior authors on the study, which is already available online.","Researchers use brain scans and network analysis to map the brains of patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum .
People with this condition, which affected real-life Rain Man Kim Peek, are lacking the neurological structure which connects the left and right brains .
Scientists hope their findings will shed light on why some people with the condition develop autism and others do not ."

A criminal investigation is under way after a hacker apparently accessed private photos and emails sent between members of the Bush family, including both former presidents . NBC News correspondent Janet Shamlian tweeted this photo of former president George H.W. Bush on February 4, 2013 with the text, 'President George H.W.

The website quotes 'Guccifer' as describing himself as a veteran hacker who has long been in the government's sights. A spokesman for former President George H. W. Bush declined to comment on The Smoking Gun report detailing the alleged security breach. Bush spokesman Jim McGrath told the Houston Chronicle the matter is 'under criminal investigation.' Included in the hacked material is a list of home addresses cell phone numbers and e-mails for dozens of Bush family members. The hacker also apparently accessed at least half a dozen e-mail accounts, including the account of Dorothy Bush Koch, George W.

In a December 27 e-mail to his four siblings, Jeb Bush saluted his father’s 'kindness and good nature' and discussed 'how kind he was with President Clinton and he helped restore his sordid reputation.

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 06:20 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:20 EST, 1 March 2013 . The iPhone 5: New details have emerged of the budget version of Apple's iconic smartphone that the firm is rumoured to be working on . Apple will launch a new, plastic bodied version of the iPhone at a budget price as early as this year, it has been claimed. The long-awaited budget iPhone will just £220 ($330), according to reports - roughly half the cost of a full-blown version of the iconic smartphone. It is understood that it will be enclosed in a glossy polycarbonate plastic case, much like the one found on the now-discontinued entry-level MacBook. It has long been rumoured that Apple is preparing a cheaper version of its flagship mobile product, in an attempt to increase the company's penetration into emerging markets. Details of the budget iPhone were published yesterday by Japanese blog Macotakara, which claimed Apple was to defer the release of a larger-screened successor to the iPhone 5, but may soon launch a less expensive handset. It suggests that the budget iPhone will be be given a launch price of just $330 - similar to the iPad mini -  in order to appeal to young, middle class consumers in countries like China and India. The entry-level phone will also be thicker than the iPhone 5, Macotakara reports, to make its polycarbonate body more durable, and could come in a variety of colours. However, the design of the cheaper iPhone is said to be similar to its costlier siblings, including a home button beneath its LCD display. That means a patent granted the company in January which showed a phone with no home button is likely not the design for the scaled-down smart phone, as was previously speculated. Earlier this month Apple CEO Tim Cook let slip during a rare interview that an affordable iPhone might be in development. 'We are making moves to make things more affordable': Comments made by Apple CEO Tim Cook last month seemed to suggest that the company was working on a cheaper equivalent to the iPhone for emerging markets . iPhone covers shaped like knuckledusters that sold in their thousands after Rihanna was seen using one have been banned from eBay in case they are used to attack people. The £25 aluminium case became a celebrity must-have after the singer, pictured right, was pictured with hers last year. But eBay has removed the web pages of sellers, saying the cases are legally classed as weapons and breach its guidelines. However, flimsier plastic versions are still for sale. 'We are making moves to make things more affordable,' he said at the Goldman Sachs technology and internet conference in San Francisco. The revelation came after Mr Cook said that he saw a 'wide open field' because Apple's iPhone was currently 'only available to 50 per cent of [mobile phone] subscribers in the world'. Asked whether the problem might be that only 50 per cent could afford an iPhone, Mr Cook said: 'Good question.  Our North Star is ""great products"" - we would never do something that isn't a great product, that's not why we're on this earth. 'That said, if you look at what we've done to appeal to people that are price sensitive — lower price of iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, in most recent quarter, not enough supply of iPhone 4 - surprised us.' Apple has not unveiled another trailblazing product since Mr Cook took over, raising concerns about whether the company is losing the ingenuity that has set it apart from the rest of the technology pack. Analysts have said that the Californian firm should make a cheaper smartphone to gain more of a foothold in the important Chinese market.","Long-awaited budget iPhone will cost just £220 ($330) report on Japanese site claims .
