Global footwear brand Nine West has been slammed on social media, alongside threats from customers promising to boycott the brand, for their newly launched advertising campaign which has been dubbed misogynistic. The retailer, which has had a large number of stores across Australia since 1995, launched its Starter Husband Hunting campaign on social media last Friday, directed at women between the ages of 25 and 49. The images, posted on Nine West's Facebook and Twitter accounts, shows a leopard print high-heel on a target with an arrow struck through it, alongside the words: 'It's hunting season. Whether you're looking for Mr. Right or Mr. Right Now, we have a shoe for that'. Facebook and Twitter both exploded upon the company sharing the images, with many claiming that the advertisement belonged back in the 1950s. 'Stupid campaign 9W. Love your shoes but don't patronize your customers by an outdated ideal. Women are hunting success and goals, dreams and visions. Not husbands,' Julie Bohacek wrote on Facebook.

Women are hunting success and goals, dreams and visions. Not husbands' Carey Shoufler responded on Twitter with the following post: 'Cannot believe this campaign. What if I'm a lesbian or don't want a man? Can I wear your shoes? Come on over to the 21st century.' 'I definitely don't need or want 'husband-hunting' shoes. In fact, after this ad I don't need ANY Nine West shoes,' Hillary Kelly wrote on Twitter. Nine West also revealed their further marketing plans for a range of other 'occasions' to the New York Times. One such 'event' was the 'anticipatory walk of shame', which the brand designed a leopard print bag for.

The accompanying text reads: 'The bus arrives and so do the waterworks. Then it hits you: mommy now has the weeks off. Wipe those happy-sad tears... We got a shoe for that.' The campaign hasn't proven to be a failure with everyone however, with one woman commenting on Nine West's social media post with:' Nailed it!

"By . Lillian Radulova . Ruslan Kogan, founder and CEO of international electronics manufacturer Kogan, washed an employees car after losing a bet . He's been named one of the top 50 most influential people in tech and has a reported wealth of about $315 million. But come Tuesday, Ruslan Kogan got out the suds and a vacuum cleaner to personally hand clean one of his employee's cars after losing a bet. Mr Kogan, the founder and CEO of international electronics manufacturer and online retail business Kogan, promised to wash the car of anyone who beat him in the 10 kilometre Melbourne Marathon charity run almost a year ago. The Melbourne raised millionaire, who sponsored 25 people to participate in the race, was eventually beaten by one of his own employees. Fulfilling his promise, the serial entrepreneur not only spent half an hour of his day scrubbing away at the jeep, but he even let the winner stream it live for the world to see. 'There was a 10 kilometre charity run almost a year ago and I was trying to motivate as many of my team as possible to enter because we are a tech based business and spend all our time in front of a computer screen,' Mr Kogan told Daily Mail Australia. 'The run was at 7am on Sunday morning, so we sent an email around for the whole team and four or five said ""I'm in"", but I thought ""Nah, we need more people"". Scroll down for video . The millionaire, who is believed to be worth $315 million, promised to wash the car of any employee who beat him in a 10 kilometre charity run in an effort to encourage his employees to be active . 'So I sent another email around saying that whoever enters, if they beat me at this run, I'll wash their car. 'It basically meant I trained pretty hard core - I have a business to run so I didn't want to spend the rest of my life washing cars.' The award-winning businessman recalled the moment that his employee, a man named Ross Metherell who he said was fairly modest, overtook him on the track. 'I remember I had kilometer to go and I was just ahead of him and then I saw him overtake me and sprint towards the finish line – he beat me by like a 100 metres,' Mr Kogan said. It took almost a year for him to fulfill his promise due to Ross savoring the moment and waiting for 'the perfect moment' for his boss to wash his car - which finally arrived after a weekend of off-road driving. The video was recorded by the winner and streamed live to the Kogan company office as well as across the internet . Despite the bet-winning employee saving the moment until his car was dirty from an off-road driving trip, Mr Kogan said he would use similar tactics to encourage his employees to be active in the future . Despite the labour, Mr Kogan said he would definitely use similar tactics again to encourage his team to participate in active events in the future, even laughing that the job took him back to his youth. 'It was all a bit of fun and everyone was a winner – a charity was helped out, we got fitter and one of the staff has one of the cleanest cars in Melbourne,' Mr Kogan said. 'I ran a car wash business when I was 10-years-old, so it was a bit of nostalgia to be honest. 'When I was 10, I was living in housing commission flats in Elsternwick, Melbourne and I used to wash my parents car for $5 once a month, and then we were driving past a billboard one month which was advertising a car wash and it said it would cost only half price of $40 for them to wash your car. 'I saw it and thought ""I'm being ripped off here!"" So I went door knocking in the area asking people if they wanted their car washed for $15. 'Before I knew it I was booked out every weekend and had to have a couple of mates with me and we'd go around with our backpacks washing these cars.'","Ruslan Kogan, founder and CEO of international electronics manufacturer Kogan, washed an employees car after losing a bet .

"By . Lillian Radulova . He was only one when his father took him out on a wide board on the Hawaiian swells, and it was instantly clear that Kobi Clements loved to surf. Now nine-years-old, the rising star from Narrabeen in Northern Sydney, is making a name for himself internationally as the next big thing in the surfing world. With four sponsors already under his belt, including Volcom, Nixon, Creatures of Leisure and Chilli Surfboards, the charismatic surfer is wowing professionals everywhere. After winning a number of local junior competitions, including Hurley BL's Blast, Kobi's raw skill has been compared to that of American professional surfer Kelly Slater . The nine-year-old first got on a board with the help of his pro-surfer dad, Steve Clements, in Hawaii when he was only one . Kobi told the Daily Mail Australia that he loves surfing and drawing and hopes to be a professional surfer when he grows up, while his dad laughed in the background describing the big smile on his son's face as he spoke. 'My favourite trick is doing cut backs – It's when you bend your knees and you lean towards the white wash. I like it because I know it the most and it's kind of easy,' Kobi said. After competing in a number of local junior competitions, including Hurley BL's Blast, Kobi's skill has been compared to that of a young Kelly Slater, an American professional surfer who has won the title of ASP World Tour Champion 11 times. But Kobi and his father, former professional surfer Steve Clements, prefer to take a more humble approach to all the positive attention. 'How I look at it is they're comparing him to when those guys were young, they had the same raw talent that Kobi does now, and if they progress that way then there's a good chance they'll be very similar,' Mr Clements said. 'Kobi is very humble. He still loves school and whenever all his teachers and friends say ""wow, what you did was amazing"" he just doesn't care too much for it. He just goes ""yeh, lets go for some handball"".' [caption . Kobi's older brother Ethan, 15, and his younger sister Thais, five, were also taught how to surf by their father, who said a regular family day out is spent down at the beach . But despite their humility, Kobi's abilities continue to be showcased around the world. The talented young man is 'making his own tracks' according to his dad, who revealed that his son performed so well in a recent competition in Hawaii that he was invited to an event in the United States. 'We were just there to enjoy the surf and then Volcom told us that he could go into the contest there that had the best surfer kids over there - from nine to 12 years old -  the best of Hawaii,' Mr Clements said. 'It was good solid swell and he got second! He got a barrel and did some nice big manoeuvres -  it's a great start for him.' At the competition in the United States he finished in the quarter finals. But for his father, the whole process is about growing up and getting world experiences - not just competing. His father, former professional surfer Steve Clements (left) revealed Kobi recently came second in a competition in Hawaii . Steve also said that before he was sponsored, Kobi would just draw on Volcom's logo onto his board . 'He's done a few competitions, but we're not too fussed about all that,' Mr Clements told the Daily Mail Australia. 'It's more about him surfing and getting more experience with what all the conditions are like and learning new things.' 'The opportunity he has to just go surfing and experience life this way - it's only going to make him lead a better life by giving him all these opportunities to travel and see and experience.' The primary school student is incredibly humble, according to his father who said 'he's outside all the time and just a massive adventurer' The father-of-three is determined to help his son focus less on competitive attitudes and more on the 'opportunities to just go surfing and lead a better life by traveling and seeing and experiencing things' From his own experiences, Mr Clements knows all too well what kind of bonuses such experiences can bring. It was at a contest he was participating in himself many years ago that the now recreational surfer, who only just missed out on the World Tour for three years, met his French wife. It was during another competition, in Hawaii eight years ago, that Mr Clements first noticed Kobi's love for riding waves. 'I was in Hawaii doing some competitive surfing for contests and Kobi was just one-years-old and I borrowed a big flat board and took him out – It was his first time on a board catching a wave, and I just held him and he just enjoyed every moment of it,' the proud father-of-three said.","Kobi already has four sponsors under his belt including Volcom, Nixon, Creatures of Leisure and Chilli Surfboards .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Brisbane mother Kellie van Meurs has died after suffering a heart attack while receiving a stem cell treatment in Moscow . A Brisbane mother-of-two has passed away from an apparent heart attack while receiving controversial stem cell therapy in Russia which remains unapproved in Australia. Kellie van Meurs traveled to Moscow in June to receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for her neurological disorder, Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), a rare disease which causes muscle spasms. Family and friends of the mother have said it was not the controversial treatment that killed her on July 19, but rather that the treatment was her last hope to live a pain free life. Mrs van Meurs was inspired to undertake HSCT after hearing of the success story of Multiple Sclerosis sufferer Kristy Cruise, who she soon became very close friends with. Ms Cruise underwent the same procedure last year to treat her own condition. The treatment involves intense chemotherapy and the patient's own stem cells being drawn out of the blood stream before being transplanted back, in an effort to 're-grow' their immune system from scratch. While the exact reason for her death remains unclear, Ms van Meurs' family remains satisfied that the hospital in Moscow gave Mrs van Meurs the best care possible. 'Kellie was in great pain. Her treatments here gave her limited quality of life. She wanted the chance to be free of the shackles of SPS and enjoy a normal life as a Mum and wife,' Kristy Cruise told Daily Mail Australia. Mrs van Meurs's family do not believe she died from the hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), which she was receiving in an attempt to treat her neurological disorder, Stiff Person Syndrome . 'It is my belief the result may well have been the same if she had been treated with HSCT in Australia.' Ms Cruise said that Mrs van Meurs had applied for HSCT in Australia, but that she grew desperate for treatment as the wait for approval continued and her health deteriorated. 'The key thing is that her doctors here said that they would try and do a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, but it was all held up in red tape and she just couldn't wait, so we need to get a move on and get this happening in Australia,' Ms Cruise said. 'It is currently in extremely limited trials in Sydney, with very few patients who meet strict criteria being accepted. HSCT is currently performed for MS in over a dozen first-world countries. The Australian healthcare system is too conservative and the funding for clinical trials is too limited. Kristy Cruise, a close friend of Mrs van Meurs who received the same treatment to treat her Multiple Sclerosis, said Kellie's health was deteriorating as she waited for the procedure to be approved for her in Australia . 'The FDA has been trialling this treatment for over a decade and FDA approval is expected in 2022.  When will Australia catch up with the rest of the world?' Both Ms Cruise and Mrs van Meurs received HSCT in the Pirogov National Medical Surgical Centre in Moscow, which currently has a waiting list of over two thousand people from around the world, according to Dr Denis Fedorenko. Nine Australians are currently being treated by the hospital as 300 more await their turn. The Moscow hospital where Ms van Meurs (pictured) was being treated, currently had a waiting list of 300 other Australians hoping to undergo the treatment which is not approved in Australia . 'The demand for pro-active, clinically-researched treatments for MS is massive. Current successful applicants are being given dates in 2016,' Ms Cruise, who is currently assisting 80 Australians seeking HSCT from the Pirogov hospital, said. 'Patients are sick of being told that this is a ""liveable"" disease. Those who seek HSCT feel their current quality of life and the negative outlook for their health outweighs the small risk associated with this treatment.' The demand is so high however, that the hospital was recently forced to delayed a number of treatment dates for approved Australian patients. Ms Cruise has set up a fundraising page to help Mrs van Meurs' family pay for her funeral costs.","Kellie van Meurs was receiving a hematopoietic stem cell transplant in Moscow when she is believed to have suffered a heart attack .

"By . Lillian Radulova . A new survey investigating the toll of a big weekend on workplace productivity, has found that almost one in ten people have gone to work while still under the influence of illegal drugs. The survey of 1000 Victorians by the Australian Drug Foundation also found that one in five people have come to work while tipsy or drunk. One in five also admitted to taking a sickie from work due to the effects of alcohol while 40 per cent of respondents said they had gone to work while still feeling the general effects of drinking. A survey of 1000 Victorians by the Australian Drug Foundation, found that one in five people have come to work while tipsy or drunk and nearly one in 10 have turned up still feeling the effects of illegal drugs . The ADF's head of workplace services, Phillip Collins, said the effects of drinking on the weekend can greatly impact a person's performance at work. 'From an individual perspective, most people don't fully understand the effect alcohol has on them - particularly when it comes to drinks one night having an impact well into the next day,' Mr Collins said. 'Alcohol affects a person's concentration, coordination, decision making ability and slows reaction times. These can have implications for workplace safety and productivity.' Mr Collins also clarified that drug use over the weekend is as equally problematic in the workplace the following day. 'Feeling the after effects of weekend drug use can be just as problematic as being intoxicated on the job. Headaches, blurred vision, irritability, difficulty concentrating and extreme tiredness can all create organisational problems,' he said. Phillip Collins from the ADF said alcohol and drugs effect a person's concentration, coordination and decision making ability at work, as well as causing headaches, blurred vision, irritability and extreme tiredness . 'Drugs and alcohol cost Australian businesses $6 billion a year in lost productivity and absenteeism alone. 'Then there's the serious health and safety risks in the workplace, particularly where employees operate machinery or drive vehicles.' However Mr Collins warned that measures such as drug testing employees, other than those in transport or heavy machinery, should not be adopted without caution. 'Drug testing isn't the only solution, and simply will not work when delivered in isolation. All businesses need a formal workplace policy in conjunction with education, training and support programs.'","The Australian Drug Foundation survey involved 1000 Victorians .

"By . Associated Press . and Lillian Radulova . Singapore Airlines has issued an apology for their social media posts, made in the wake of Malaysian jetliner MH17 being shot down, which received intense scrutiny for being insensitive. After the Malaysia Airlines plane went down over Ukraine with 298 people on board on Thursday, postings on Facebook and Twitter from Singapore Airlines claimed that its flights do not fly across Ukrainian airspace. The remarks received hundreds of scathing comments across the social media platforms, from people both offended by the airliners lack of 'ethics' and others who claimed their post's claims were false. Singapore Airlines posted this message on their social media pages following the announcement that Malaysian airline MH17 had been shot down . Other social media users responded to the airliners posts with outrage, claiming the company was being 'insensitive' and 'unethical' 'A post starting with condolence (and) then, stating your planes are diverted and not using this airspace anymore would have made (you) sound less heartless!' Joannica Dass wrote on Facebook. 'This statement is totally unethical. Have some respect for the one's who lost their lives,' Jose Zahirsha wrote on Twitter. Others drew attention to tracking reports that recorded a Singapore Airlines plane traveling within 25 kilometres of MH17 just before it was shot down above Ukraine. However, some social media users felt many were overreacting to Singapore Airlines' remarks, and said the carrier was merely trying to get a message across to its customers. Messages of condolences were posted by Singapore Airlines after the initial posts, however the company still sent an email apology afterwards . 'I don't think their comment was to advertise or boast their flight routes as much as it was to ease the tension of the hundreds of passengers that are scheduled to fly out to other countries over the next few days,' Karishma Sharma wrote on Facebook. On Saturday, Singapore Airlines apologized and tried to clarify its remarks. 'We are aware of that our Facebook and Twitter update on Friday morning may have come across as insensitive to some. The post was in response to many requests from our customers who had asked for information about our flight routes for their upcoming flights with us,' Singapore Airlines said in an email to The Associated Press. 'We recognize that the information could have been better communicated and we sincerely apologize if it had offended our customers and anyone else in the online community,' it said. Others were critical of news that emerged of two planes, including one Singapore Airlines plane, that had been flying over Ukraine only 25 kilometres from MH17 when it was shot down . Two other planes were revealed to be flying within 25 kilometres of MH17 over Ukrainian airspace, as the Malaysian Airlines plane was shot out of the sky. The news comes alongside criticism and questions as to why commercial plane's were flying over the airspace at all after the airspace was declared a war zone. According to Crikey, two other aircraft had been shot down above Ukraine in the week before the MH17 tragedy, a Ukrainian military cargo plane and a Ukrainian jet fighter.

"By . Lillian Radulova . A Chinese restaurant in the heart of Sydney's Chinatown has received a barrage of racist abuse after an article was published claiming they charged higher prices for non-Chinese customers. A story in Sydney's Daily Telegraph newspaper claimed the Yin Li SIchuan Chinese Restaurant charged English-speaking customers 'more than 10 per cent extra per dish' than on the Chinese language menu. Since the story appeared, the restaurant has been the subject of at least ten racist telephone threats, Ms Zhang said, as well as a torrent of abuse directed to the restaurant online. Diana Xu says she was falsely accused of charging English speaking customers more than Chinese customers at her Sydney restaurant, Yin Li Sichuan . The restaurant has received at least 10 threatening phone calls as well as abusive comments on a review page for their business on Facebook . Ren Zhou Lawyers representing the Yin Li Sichuan told the Daily Mail Australia the owners were considering legal action. Lawyer Ying Zhang said the owner flatly denied ever telling the reporter there was a 'secret price' for Chinese customers. This is despite the article stating: 'Yin Li Sichuan restaurant owner Diana suggested [the price difference] was meant to be a secret among Asian customers.' Ms Zhang said the Yin Li Sichuan Restaurant would wait and see if there is further racist abuse from members of the public and if their business began to suffer before proceeding with legal action. 'The difference between the prices is only for three items on the menu, and it is because of a printing error. The Chinese menu had not been updated,' she said. Mapo Tofu (above) was one of three items in which the price on the Chinese menu had not been updated. Ms Xu said the restaurant has since updated their Chinese menu to be exactly the same as the English menu (right) The boiled fish with pickled cabbage and chili is the same price in both English and Chinese menus (above) The Chinese version of the boiled fish with pickled cabbage and chili is the same price in the Chinese and English menus (above) The Daily Telegraph reported that the restaurant's two menus - one written in English and one in Chinese - had different prices despite listing the same dishes. But Ms Xu told the Mail Online that this was only the case for three dishes the fried rice with lettuce and beef, the Mapo tofu and the dried spicy beans. Those three dishes were 'different by $1 or $2'. She said that some of the older Chinese menus still had to be updated with recent price increases. The boiled beef in hot chili oil is another dish which has the same price in both Chinese (left) and English (right). Yin Li Sichuan has 80 dishes on the menu . 'This year we have an increase in rent and staff [numbers] have increased,' Ms Xu said. 'The English menu is a new menu. This Chinese menu we actually need to fix.' Ms Xu said that she was shocked to read the article and very upset at being accused of discrimination. 'I think many things are not true because we don't have different [prices] for Chinese people and Australian people,' she said. Ms Xu  said she was distraught at the claims her restaurant was 'racist', saying she had been open for 13 years and had a number of regulars both Chinese and non-Chinese backgrounds . 'We have been open for 13 years, we can promise everything is the same. All customers, if they come in my restaurant, are welcome.' She said that she only offered discounts to a small number of regulars, both Chinese and non-Chinese, who she said visit the restaurant for a meal at least two or three times a week, adding that they received the same discount regardless of their background, race or the language they speak. The only difference in the menus is the variation of spiciness, particularly in sauces, which she said they decided to change after local customers complained.","Yin Li Sichuan restaurant says the article claiming they charge more than 10 per extra for non-Chinese patrons is unfair and incorrect .
Racist abuse has been directed towards the restaurant after it was revealed three items on the English menu were $1 or $2 higher .

"By . Lillian Radulova . An Australian Insurance company has been accused of practicing 'predatory advertising' after they attempted to use the MH17 disaster to cash-in through their life insurance offers. The Lisa Group, which deals with loans, insurance and superannuation and is based in Victoria, allegedly bought  the Google key words 'Malaysia Airlines' on the morning that news came in of the aviation tragedy. The company then ran an advertisement for their life insurance offers that would appear at the top of search results when someone would Google the words. The Lisa Group, a Victoria based insurance company, allegedly bought the Google key words 'Malaysia Airlines' on Friday morning before using the tragedy to advertise their life insurance offers . The words 'What a tragedy!' began the introduction to the 'special offer'. 'Up to 27 Australians were among 298 people on board a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet which was shot down over Ukraine with the loss of all on board,' the add read. 'Is it another sign to consider life insurance? #PrayForMH17.' The company has since removed their advertisements but continues to receive wide criticism for the insensitive move. When questioned about their marketing decision, the company's director, Warren Lazarus, told Mumbrella that their overseas partners were to blame for the poor decision. The company received backlash from social media users for the insensitive advertising . The company has since removed their advertisements and apologized for the insensitive move, claiming it was their overseas partners were to blame . 'We were made aware of the ads and immediately contacted our overseas partner and ordered it to be taken down,' Mr Lazarus said. 'I apologise for any distress this has caused, we have removed the add,' he added before allegedly hanging up. When the Daily Mail Australia approached the Lisa Group they were also told by Mr Lazarus that the company wanted to appologise for any distress caused.

"By . Lillian Radulova . Abdullah Elmir's whereabouts remain unknown despite 16-year-old Feiz, who disappeared with him, being found safe and preparing to fly back home with his father . A 16-year-old Sydney teenager has been found safe and is preparing to come home alongside his father, after he ran away to fight in Iraq and Syria in June. Known as Feiz, the boy from Bankstown in Sydney's west, secretly left the country with Abdullah Elmir, 17, who told his parents he was going fishing. While Abdullah's whereabouts are still unknown, The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Feiz and his father are currently in Lebanon from where they will travel back to Sydney with assistance from the Australian Federal Police. Abdullah and Feiz are believed to have made their way to Turkey, from where they were last known to have contacted family members, via Perth, with stops in Malaysia and Thailand. Reports stated that Abdullah's family suspected he was planning to cross the border into Iraq. It remains unknown who is responsible for paying and organising the two boys' trips. On Friday, a man named Abu Bakr Al Australi, allegedly became the first Australian responsible for a suicide bombing in Iraq which killed at least five people. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that community members do not believe Abdullah was the Australian behind the attack. Feiz and Abdullah secretly left their homes in June and flew to Turkey from where they are last known to have contacted family members. They are believed to have been trying to cross the border to Iraq to join the war . Amidst news that the federal government has listed support of an extremist group by an Australia an offence punishable by up to 25 years in jail, Attorney General George Brandis revealed the number of Australians believed to be supporting extremist groups at a press conference earlier this week. 'There are probably about 60 Australians in Syria fighting for one side or the other but predominantly the anti- government side, and an alarming number of those people are gravitating towards the Al-Qaeda off-shoot,' Mr Brandis said. 'We have some 10s of people who have already returned and we have probably another 150 who we are looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements.' It is believed that Abdullah was most likely recruited to join an Islamic terror group to fight in the troubled war zone after he was brainwashed by Jihadist recruitment videos online. Abdullah is believed to have been brainwashed by recruitment videos such as this one by the ISIS, titled There Is No Life Without Jihad, which urges people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort' His family said they do no know why he would abandon his family and the promise of a university education and that he had not shown signs of radical behaviour before leaving . The family, who hold grave concerns for his safety, only learnt of his travel arrangements to Iraq via a text message he left with a friend which simply said to tell his mother he was 'gone'. Australia does not have an embassy or consulate in either Syria or Iraq so the Government's ability to deliver assistance in the Middle East is limited.","16-year-old Feiz, has been found safe and is planning a trip back to Sydney .

"By . Lillian Radulova . A prestigious beachfront property on Australia's famous Gold Coast strip in Queensland sold for a loss of $4.7 million dollars on Sunday. The Mediterranean style house on Hedges Ave at Mermaid Beach, set on a 405m sq block, was last bought in 2008 by cotton farmer Alan Frost for a whopping $8.7 million. But despite over 50 inspections and four bidders on the day, the four bedroom house failed to secure much more than the opening bid of $3.8 million. 241 Hedges Ave at Mermaid Beach, a beachfront property on the Gold Coast was sold at a $4.7 million loss on Sunday . The prestigious four bedroom house was last bought for $8.7 million in 2008, but only sold for $4 million recently . The home features an open fireplace, an indoor spa, five bathrooms and a deck in the backyard that leads straight to the ocean. Real estate agent Tony Velissariou from Prestige Property Sales in Surfers Paradise said the sale price was not much of a surprise, linking it's greatly decreased value to the GFC. 'Properties are only just slowly making a move back and increasing in that beach front sector after prestige property's of that sort declined back a certain degree from the GFC,' Mr Velissariou said. 'The market is increasing every month here at the moment and we will see pieces keep continuing to grow as our real estate sector has stabilised.' The home features an open fireplace, an indoor spa, five bathrooms and a deck in the backyard that leads straight to the ocean . Real estate agent Tony Velissariou from Prestige Property Sales in Surfers Paradise said the sale price was not much of a surprise, with the opening bid starting at only $3.8 million . He said the GFC was to primarily to blame for the decrease in value, and said the market is only just slowly catching up to the prices common in 2008-2009 . Mr Velissariou also added, in relation to growing property values: 'We run approximately eight to 12 months behind the markets in Sydney and Melbourne'. Despite the massive loss, the Mail Online was told that the former owner of the majestic house was happy with the price he got. 'The seller was quite happy. At the same time he's buying and selling in the same market, so he's really just swapping the deck chairs around in that sense,' Mr Velissariou said. The new owner is believed to have bought the house as a holiday home. Paul Pfeiffer, an Estate Agent for RT Edgar in Toorak Victoria, said that estates in Sydney and Melbourne are also struggling to return to the higher figures reached in 2008. 'I think it is common knowledge that the QLD market has been overpriced for a decade, fueled predominantly by offshore investment,' Mr Pfeiffer said.

"By . Lillian Radulova . The 2014 Archibald Prize was awarded to Sydney artist Fiona Lowry on Friday for her mesmerising painting of architect Penelope Seidler. Ms Lowry was one of 54 finalists in the portrait competition who was finally chosen for the $75,000 prize at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. She said she was inspired by the very subject of her winning portrait upon first seeing Ms Seidler at a gallery opening six years ago. Sydney artist Fiona Lowry wont the $75,000 Archibald Prize for her moving portrait of Killara architect Penelope Seidler . 'I was really struck by her beauty and her presence and asked someone who she was. I decided then that I would like to paint her,' Lowry said. 'It is important to me when I am making a work that I take the subject to a place that has memory and history attached to it because I am interested in exploring the subject's interaction with that landscape.' The portrait, painted with an airbrush and using only a limited palette of soft, pastel colours, is set at the back of Ms Seidler's iconic Killara house, which she designed along with her late husband Harry Seidler in the 1960s. 'It's an incredible space architecturally but it is also loaded with history and memories of life very well lived. Both Ms Lowry and Ms Seidler attended the event at the Gallery of New South Wales where the winner was announced on Friday . The painting was set in Ms Seidler's backyard and captures the moment that Ms Seidler reflects on a certain view of her home from her backyard . 'We spent some time in the bush at the back of the property looking at the waterfall. 'At one point, Penelope looked back at the house towering over us and reflected that it had been some time since she had seen it from this angle. It was that reflection that I wanted to explore with this portrait.' The president of the board of trustees, Guido Belgiorno-Nettis, who lead the judging process, told the Daily Mail Australia that Ms Lowry was a clear winner from both a technical and and emotional point of view. Guido Belgiorno-Nettis, who lead the judging process, told the Daily Mail Australia that Ms Lowry was a clear winner from both a technical and and emotional point of view . 'Firstly it's an extraordinary interpretation of Penelope Seidler. Quite a few of us know her as trustees, so we were able to see that quality that she was able to capture,' Mr Belgiorno-Nettis said. 'It is a very penetrating look – a reflective, deep, intense look on her face that I think Fiona was just brilliantly able to capture with her technique of using an airbrush. 'We thought this was an absolutely stand outstanding portrait.' This is the third time Ms Lowry has been a finalist in the Archibald Prize, coming a close second in last year's competition. This year she was also a finalist for the Sulman Prize.","Fiona Lowry won the $75,000 prize for her portrait of Penelope Seidler .

"By . Lillian Radulova . An Australian man is believed to be responsible for a suicide bombing that killed at least five people and injured 90 in Baghdad on Thursday, marking the incident as the first committed by an Australian in Iraq. The Islamic State of Iraq, dubbed a terrorist group by the Australian government, reported via Twitter that a man called Abu Bakr al-Australi detonated explosives in a market place in the heart of the Iraq city. 'Abu Bakr Al Australi may Allah accept him targets a Shiite temple the Militias use as HQ & Kills and injures 90 militiamen,' the original tweet read. Scroll down for video . An Australian man is believed to be responsible for a suicide bombing that killed at least five people and injured 90 in Baghdad on Thursday . A statement released by the terrorist group, refereed to the man as a 'hero' and a 'martyr'. A man naming himself AbuHafs D Australian on Twitter, confirmed the report saying: 'Abu Bakr al-Australi (the Australian) had detonated explosives in a vest he was wearing near the mosque.' Subsequent reports by Al-Jazeera, issued a different account of the events in which the news-agency quoted a local police officer who claimed that the explosives had been hidden on a wooden cart. According to medical officials in Baghdad four people were killed but only 12 wounded, downscaling the casualty figures reported by the Islamic State. The Islamic State of Iraq, dubbed a terrorist group by the Australian government, reported that the man was named Abu Bakr al-Australi via Twitter . A ministry spokesman, Brigadier Saad Maan, meanwhile told the National Iraqui News Agency that 'A terrorist attack targeted Hussein bin Roh shrine near killing 5 people and injuring 37 others'. Al-Australi is often used at the end of jihadist names to identify the person as coming from Australia. The incident comes only a week after the Australian government officially named the Islamic State group as a terrorist organisation, and clarifying that  citizens intending to join, fight with or fund a listed terrorist groups in Iraq or Syria could face up to 25 years in jail. Attorney General, George Brandis, also revealed details about the number of Australians believed to be supporting extremist groups at a press conference earlier this week. 'There are probably about 60 Australians in Syria fighting for one side or the other but predominantly the anti- government side, and an alarming number of those people are gravitating towards the Al-Qaeda off-shoot,' Mr Brandis said. 'We have some 10s of people who have already returned and we have probably another 150 who we are looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements.' In a statement on Friday, Mr Brandis commented on the alleged suicide bombing in Iraq. 'If correct, this is a disturbing development and is a further example of the dangerous and volatile situation in Iraq at present. This would be the second Australian suicide bomber in the Iraq and Syria conflicts,' he said. 'The Government deplores the violent actions being undertaken by ISIL and other extremist groups in Iraq and Syria, and is deeply concerned about the involvement of Australians in these activities. 'As I have said many times, it is illegal for Australians to engage in the conflicts in Iraq and Syria and the Government urges Australians not to travel to the region. 'The participation by Australians in the conflict in Iraq and Syria poses a significant domestic security threat to Australia when those involved return home and seek to pursue violence here. 'The Government will continue to take all necessary measures to keep Australia and Australian interests safe.' Late last year, a Queensland man was reportedly behind another suicide bombing in Syria while fighting for the terrorist group the al-Nusrah Front.","Terrorist group, the Islamic State, tweeted that 'Abu Bakr al-Australi' was responsible for bombing in Baghdad .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Kristy Cruise is one of a growing number of Australians traveling overseas to receive controversial stem cell transplant treatments . In a desperate attempt to stop the disease that was ravaging her body, Kristy Cruise booked a flight to Moscow and forked out $40,000 to receive risky stem cell transplant treatment. The 36-year-old mother-of-two, who was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis early last year, is now leading the way for a growing number of Aussies who aren't prepared to wait for medical trials to be approved in Australia. After suffering from constant bone pain, pins and needles and cognitive dysfunction before finally being hospitalized and unable to walk for four days, Kristy says she is now completely cured and is in the process of directing 80 other Australians with MS through the same treatment. 'It just hit me when I was in hospital. I was in there for four days because I wasn't able to walk properly and I was just feeling so miserable and I realised that this is going to be the rest of my life - not working, not being able to be a mum,' Kristy told the Daily Mail Australia. 'Before I went to Russia, I really couldn't be a mum. I couldn't take them anywhere alone, I couldn't pick them up and drop them off at school most of the time', the heartbroken mum revealed. 'The dialogue they constantly heard was ""mummy is too tired, mummy doesn't feel very well"", so I wasn't present, I just wasn't an active mother in their lives.' Scroll down for video . The mother-of-two flew to Moscow in 2013 where she payed $40,000 for her treatment after her suffering from Multiple Sclerosis escalated . Kristy (pictured here with her two sons Bodhi and Shannon) is one of 23,000 Australians living with Multiple Sclerosis, a disease of the central nervous system . Kristy is one of 23,000 Australians living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a disease of the central nervous system which affects the way electrical pulse messages are sent from the brain and spinal chord to the rest of the body.  The disease exhibits itself in random episodes or attacks, where patients may lose function of parts of their body for certain periods of time. However in the majority of MS sufferers, the disease continues to progress over time, deteriorating their body slowly. According to Dr John Moore, a senior staff specialist in hematology at St Vincent's hospital in Sydney, there is no cure for MS, but various treatments are available to suppress the frequency of such attacks. Dr Moore is also the principle investigator of a phase two study into Stem cell transplantation in auto immune diseases at St Vincent's, where only nine patients have been given the treatment - all with positive results. There is no cure for MS, and although studies into the benefits of stem cell therapy for the disease continue around the world, it has not yet been approved in Australia . Kristy spent five weeks in Moscow undergoing the treatment which involved intensive chemo therapy and her stem cells being drawn out of her body and filtered before being replaced . Similar research has been conducted around the world since 1996, with many country's offering the procedure for high fees.  But the treatments have not yet been approved in Australia due to ethical reasons. 'We could do it here – we could set it up in a private hospital but we don't think that it's ethical,' Dr Moore said. 'It definitely works, but we don't know which patients it works best with and we don't know if it's better than the current standard treatment. Dr John Moore, the principle investigator of a study into the treatment in auto immune diseases at St Vincent's, said the procedure is incredibly risky . 'This is not a simple procedure. It is a risky procedure and there is a risk of dying from complications.' Despite begging Dr Moore over the phone for hours, Kristy was told she would not be accepted for treatment under the Australian study. 'It's very hard to qualify and I knew I might have to spend years and year jumping through hoops trying to qualify while I grew more disabled,' she said. 'The hardest part for me is financial. I wasn't too concerned about going overseas generally speaking, but financial it is difficult because by going overseas I've saved the Australian government about $100,000 a year – drugs for my MS would have costed $60,000 a year, plus neurologist appointments and not to mention the disability support pension. 'I've saved the Australian government over a million dollars throughout my lifetime easily, and I'm being denied access to my own super to pay for it, so from a financial point of view it’s a real travesty.' But it has all been worth it, according to the former emergency nurse, with the symptoms being completely cleared after just five weeks in Moscow. Before leaving to Moscow constantly  felt debilitating fatigue and vertigo, had cognitive issues and memory loss, the left side of her body was often numb and random attacks left her unable to walk for days . Pictured here with her husband Keith, Kristy says she has had a complete recovery and no longer suffers from the same symptoms . She is now completely mobile, her cognitive fog has lifted and she runs up to five kilometres a day . 'Before I left, I was feeling debilitating fatigue, I had constant vertigo, I was having cognitive issues memory loss, confusion, I had a numb left side of my body, the sensation of bugs crawling around my head and shoulders,' Kristy said. 'When I left home, depending on the day, I had to use a wheelchair or a walking aid just because I would get out of my car at the supermarket and be so fatigued that I'd have to go straight back home. 'Now, I've had 100 per cent improvement. The cognitive fog has lifted, I'm 100 percent mobile -I regularly do five kilometre runs - It felt like I was back in the body I had 10 years ago.' The process involved four days of injections that would draw the stem cells which normally sit inside the bone marrow, into the blood stream. Then, Kristy spent eight hours lying flat while the stem cells were drawn out of her blood stream. After four days of high intensity chemo therapy, the stem cells were transplanted back into her body. After her stem cells (pictured) were placed back in her body, Kristy spent 10 days in isolation while her immune system rebuilt itself: 'My immune system was down to zero which means that a simple cold could kill you,' she said . Mr Moore described the process as  'growing a new immune system' and said it is the most risky process of the procedure as the patient's immune system has been suppressed. 'My immune system was down to zero which means that a simple cold could kill you,' Kristy said. She thus spent 10 days in isolation while her immune system rebuilt itself, however it will take at least six months in total. Now, the active mother spends her days inspiring others through her success story. She works about 50 hours a week, not for profit, traveling around the country and giving talks about her experience. She has also been supporting 80 other Australians with MS to undertake the same HSTC procedure overseas, and is currently working as an interpreter for her former Russian doctor. 'I am now on a mission to raise awareness of the treatment option for all the Australians suffering from MS,' she said. Now, Kristy (pictured beside a Russian doctor) travels around the country talking about her experience . She has been supporting 80 other Australians with MS to undertake the same HSTC procedure overseas and is seen here giving a talk to them at the Gold Coast in April . 'Dozens of MS patients are being effectively cured of their disease each month around the world, we just need to fight for the right to received HSCT in Australia.' In the meantime, the studies and trials may be some time away from releasing definitive results for the treatment in other types of diseases. 'We are going to join a trial, that has started in the US, comparing stem cell transplants to the best available MS treatments and that trial will take about three years to complete and then another year to follow up,' Dr Moore said. 'But by then we will have a better idea of where MS stem cell transplants could fit into peoples treatments and which patients will best benefit.'

"By . Lillian Radulova . and Sarah Dean . A New Zealand bride set up the perfect wedding day surprise for her groom when she ordered a helicopter to fly them up to one of the world's most scenic peaks, only moments after they were pronounced husband and wife. Belinda, 27, and Campbell Stuart, 31, shared a once in a lifetime romantic experience as they spent their first moments as a married couple standing alone atop a mountain and looking down upon the lake of their hometown, Wanaka. Meanwhile, Melbourne based destination wedding photographer Eric Ronald, snapped the beautiful moments from the chopper. 'It was amazing. It was pretty surreal really, we ended up there after getting married and I was pretty surprised I managed to pull it off,' Belinda told the Daily Mail Australia. New Zealand bride, Belinda Stuart, set up the perfect wedding day surprise for her groom Campbell, when she ordered a helicopter to fly them up to a mountain peak above their home town, Wanaka . The newlyweds shared a once in a lifetime romantic experience as they spent their first moments as a married couple standing alone atop the mountain . Melbourne based destination wedding photographer Eric Ronald, snapped the beautiful moments after joining the couple in the chopper along with their bridal party . 'It was an awesome experience to have our alone time up there, words can't really describe it. It was like out of a movie.' The newlyweds had been together for eight and half years before they got married in February of this year, after Campbell proposed on a rainy day during a romantic weekend away. Even when the helicopter arrived to the couple's wool shed wedding venue, where 125 guests were celebrating the big day, Campbell said he still had no idea what was in store for him. 'I thought someone had broken their leg and was being airlifted,' he said. Campbell remained clueless until the last minute. He told the Daily Mail Australia that even when the helicopter arrived after they had been wed, he assumed someone had been injured and needed to be airlifted to safety . The duo admitted they had always dreamed of taking a helicopter ride on their wedding day, but as the costs of the wedding climbed they decided between them just to let the idea go . But Belinda changed her mind and booked the helicopter only six months away from the big date after she said she: 'woke up one day and thought ""I will deffinetly regret it if I don't do it""' 'I was pretty stoked to be honest, I was pretty happy. It was incredible. It was the first time I'd been in one without injury. The last time I was in a helicopter, I was getting airlifted after a skiing accident when I fractured my tibiae.' The duo, who currently live in Melbourne but plan to move back to Wanaka, admitted they had always dreamed of taking a helicopter ride on their wedding day, but as the costs of the wedding climbed they decided between them just to let the idea go. 'But I woke up one day and thought I will definitely regret it if I don't do it,' Belinda said. 'I kept it a secret, as I thought Campbell would talk me out of it, and I only organised it about six months before the actual wedding. It was worth every cent. It was a pretty magical experience. The newlyweds had been together for eight and half years before they got married in February of this year, after Campbell proposed on a rainy day during a romantic weekend away . Belinda and Campbell's wedding took place in a wool barn in New Zealand which 125 guests attended. The duo met through a mutual friend and moved to Melbourne, but plan to relocate back to their hometown . The big surprise came close to being ruined on a number of occasions, according to Belinda, who said she phoned the helicopter company four times on the day of the wedding due to being worried about the windy weather . 'Campbell doesn't know how much it costs, I think it was about $12,000 or so, because we took the whole bridal party up there which was about 10 of us in total.' The big surprise also came close to being ruined on a number of occasions, according to Belinda, who said there were some close calls. 'It was really windy, so didn't think it would go ahead and I phoned them about four times on the wedding day,' she said. 'They were late, but we waited and they turned up about 5pm.' 'I tried to keep it a secret from everyone, only one of my brothers knew.' 'It was an awesome experience to have our alone time up there, words can't really describe it.

"By . Lillian Radulova . A new app, put together by the State Library of Victoria, allows users to virtually step back onto the city streets of Melbourne in the 1800s to experience the city's rich history and the majesty behind some of its old architecture. The mobile phone program was developed in a bid to engage the Library's audience in a new way while making a fraction of their collection of 300,000 photographs more accessible. Using up to 300 photographs, Street History: Hoddle's Grid uses your location to show nearby buildings, street views and aerial photographs -  as well as the stories of each location- from as early as 1840. 'There's kind of a perception that the old city of Melbourne has been progressively demolished over the years, but one of the fascinating things is once you're aware of what lies beneath the surface, you realise that old Melbourne is still there - it's just hidden,' Peter McMahon, the State Library of Victoria's director of digital strategy said. Flinders Street Station (left) was completed in 1910. It is now Melbourne's busiest station (right), used by over 100,000 people every day. In 2013 the State Government announced a billion dollar refurbishment, to include a water-front amphitheatre and a market whilst still retaining the iconic dome and arched entrance . The Cromwell Buildings (pictured left in 1954) were a six storied brick building on the corner of Elizabeth and Bourke Streets, built in the early 1890s, and was home to the Melbourne School of Art and Nettleberg's Furriers. The building was sold to the Bank of Australasia in 1946 and demolished in the 1970s. It was replaced with an office block, which then gave way to a busy shopping mall . The New Colonial Bank of Australasia was a three storey building on the corner of Elizabeth and Little Collins Streets, constructed in 1880. After demolition, the doorway was placed on the facade of the Chemistry School in the grounds of the University of Melbourne. Following the demolition of the school, the doorway was placed at an exit from the university's underground car park. It is now a set of shops . 'For instance, I noticed the other day that if you look at the Princess Theatre and look at earlier photos, part of the facade is missing – the front of the building as it's currently presented is very different. 'It’s an old building so you'd expect it to look the way it used to look. But you can see how things have changed. A lot of things have evolved with the times, but buildings are still there. 'Another obvious interesting point is where buildings have just disappeared. One of the sad loses of the city was the old Melbourne fish markets. They were an extraordinary set of old Gothic buildings down at the far end of Flinders Street - they were demolished in 1956 and replaced with a car park.' Built in 1888, the Federal Coffee Palace stood at the corner of Collins and King Streets - once the largest hotel in Australia. It went broke, along with many other Melbourne businesses and re-opened in 1923 with an alcohol licence, as the Federal Hotel.  It contained over 400 bedrooms, billiards rooms and dining room, with a sign over the entrance which read 'Stay here. You'll be welcome'. Sadly, it was demolished in 1973 for office accommodation . Melbourne Fish Market stood to the east of Flinders Street Station ( left) , built in 1890. It was an ornate building, featuring spires and a clock tower, and covering 23,000 square metres. It was demolished in 1956 for a car park and Flinders Street flyover when Melbourne wanted to modernise its appearance for the 1956 Olympic Games . The competition to design the State Library of Victoria was won by Joseph Reed, the architect of many of Melbourne's notable buildings. The first Library building (left) opened in February 1856, during the Victorian gold rush. The current building (right), which is in fact made up of 23 buildings, takes up an entire city block . The app began being designed when the Library noticed the sheer interest in their images as well as urban history amongst the general public. 'The proportion of files being accessed via our catalogue were images, and this had gone up 300 per cent in a two year period,' Mr McMahon said. 'We also noticed an emergence in interest in urban history and a lot of our images are appearing on the web in context of people really getting into what the city used to look like.' The bluestone Melbourne Gaol (left) on Russell Street was built in the mid 1800s and housed both male and female criminals. During its operation it housed many hardened criminals, as well as petty offenders, the mentally ill and the homeless. It was the site of over 130 hangings, including bushranger Ned Kelly in 1880. The last hanging occurred in 1924. The doors were finally closed in 1929. Today (right) it is a tourist attraction and is managed by the National Trust of Australiaac . The Royal Arcade was opened in 1870 (left) and is Melbourne's oldest arcade. It features statues of the mythical characters Gog and Magog on either side of Gaunt's Clock. Royal Arcade now (right) offers boutique shopping beneath an elegant glass ceiling. The high, graceful arches reflect the European influence in the building . The former Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company Building (left) was constructed in 1891. It developed Melbourne's first horse tramway system, and Melbourne's extensive cable tram system from 1885 . But it wont just be the CBD that app users get to explore. The State Library also has plans to digitise at least 75,000 more photographs in the next year alone, revealing the historical streetscapes of the suburbs between Collingwood and Fitzroy, as well as some suburbs right up to the south of Melbourne. 'The reason it's called Street History is because we started with intentions of extending it into a series,' Mr McMahon said. 'The feedback we've received from our social media communities is people love the app and they're saying ""when are you going to do my suburb?"" 'It can certainly extend out to even regional areas; the gold fields are a perfect opportunity and point in history. We have a very rich collection for the early gold days and virtually every area has a rich history.' The original Melbourne Hospital opened in 1848 and initially only had 10 beds, increasing to 20 beds within the first year. The hospital continued to grow, with further building additions, until 1867. It became known as the Royal Melbourne Hospital and moved to Parkville in 1940s. The site was used as the Central Hospital from 1944-46, and then re-opened as the Queen Victoria Hospital, which was one of the few hospitals for women and run by women . The Rialto is a Venetian style building (left) which opened in 1891. Originally a commercial building, it had space for 300 offices and 14 warehouses. The gothic towers, balconettes and arched windows were inspired by the palazzos of Venice. Early occupants were the Melbourne wool exchange and Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works . Cole's Book Arcade opened in 1883 (left) in what is now the Bourke Street Mall (right).  It boasted over two million new and second hand books and was famous around the world. The store offered a jovial atmosphere for its customers with a pianist, a fernery and menagerie, along with toys and a confectionery department. Cole encouraged customers to read without buying . The Scots' Church, made of sandstone and limestone (left) , is a Presbyterian Church which opened in 1873.  The Church features magnificent stained glass windows depicting the Last Supper. The 120 feet high spire, the tallest structure in Melbourne in the 1880s and 1890s, was damaged by lightning in 1963 and lowered in height. However, in 1989 the spire was rebuilt to its original height (right) St Francis Church is the oldest Catholic Church in Melbourne, built originally as a wooden church in 1841 (left). It was rebuilt and reopened in 1845 and subsequently had various features added. It is still very popular today (right) - with more than 10,000 weekly attendees . 400 Flinders St: Customs House was completed in 1858 (left). Its construction reflected Melbourne's burgeoning economy following the goldrush and the influx of imports. A typical example of Melbourne's public buildings of the time, its four columns reflect the Italian Renaissance style. On the first floor is the majestic Long Room, which now acts as the main exhibition space for the Immigration Museum (right) 405 Flinders Lane: The Port Authority Building was finished in 1931 (left) during the Depression. It sits opposite Customs house and is a reminder of Melbourne's early burgeoning harbour activity. The flat roof, solid base, the four columns and classic detailing reflects the influence of the Beaux-Arts style. In 1933, the building won the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects' Street Architecture Medal. The Port Authority relocated in 1982. It is now a residential site (right)","The State Library of Victoria has begun digitising their collection of 300,000 images to make them more accessible .

Hand crafted out of ferro-cement and designed to look like a rock which follows the natural formation of the land, the Hollander House is on the market and looking for a new owner. Built between 1969 and 1971, the quirky home on Newport Beach in New South Wales, is expected to fetch well into the million dollar range if property seekers can embrace the home's psychedelic vibe. 'We haven't actually created a house price, there has been a couple of projections in the press which have been... interesting. At this point we just have to see what the market dictates,' Director of Modern House estate agents, Marcus Lloyd-Jones told the Daily Mail Australia. Built between 1969 and 1971, the quirky Hollander House at Newport Beach in New South Wales is on sale with its first viewing scheduled for July 19 . Despite there being no set house price and the estate agents waiting to see 'what the market dictates', the press has estimated it will go for aroun $1.5 million . He then added: 'It is worth a lot of money though. If you were to try and build that today, it would certainly be well over one and a half million. So then when you add in the land area, 904 square metres - well, you do the sum.' Likening it to architectural designs by Barcelona's Antonio Gaudi, Modern House describes the property as being made up entirely of curves, columns and dome-shaped ceilings. Designed by David Hollander as an 'organic' structure, each room is said to flow into the next in a natural way. 'The elliptical walls are not governed by mathematics but as the architect told a journalist in an interview as the house was nearing completion, ""I chose curves which I thought were correct aesthetically"",' the Modern House website states. The director of Modern House estate agents, Marcus Lloyd-Jones hinted to the Daily Mail Australia that he expects selling price to far exceed $1.5 million . Likening it to architectural designs by Barcelona's Antonio Gaudi's, the property has been described as being made up entirely of curves, columns and dome-shaped ceilings . The house was designed by David Hollander and hand crafted out of ferro-cement reinforced with steel . 'You can add a bit on a normally straight wall or take a bit off, and it won't really make that much difference to the rest of the plan. But with a house like this, altering one curve means everything is out!' David Hollander said of his design according to the property agent. The current owner of the home, interior designer Nancy Renzi, has put a great amount of effort into bringing the home back to its originally intended design conditions. She is the third owner of the home, buying it in 2011 for about $875,000 before stripping down everything and completely renovating it, from the floors and lighting to the gardens and even painting every one of the textured walls. 'I bought it as a project  - that was the intention all along, to restore it and reinvent it to its original design and when I finish I’d sell it and move along,' Ms Renzi said. It's design is considered 'organic' in that it follows the natural formation of the land and looks as if it is 'growing out of the site', according to Modern House . The current owner of the home, interior designer Nancy Renzi, has put a great amount of effort in maintaining the 70s style of the home . Ms Renzi's additions to the home included an outdoor bath on the large private deck attached to the main bedroom as well as an entertaining deck attached to the kitchen which features an outdoor fireplace . Her additions to the home also included an outdoor bath on the large private deck attached to the main bedroom as well as an entertaining deck attached to the kitchen which features an outdoor fireplace. 'Shes actually added to that house in a very respectful fashion and I would say its added to its appeal,' Mr Lloyd-Jones said. 'She has brought it back and made it sing again and that's a special thing to have done.' It's also not the first time that the property has made headlines, featuring in Australian House and Garden magazine in 1971, Vogue Australia in 1975 and even recently, the Sydney Morning Herald's Sunday Life this year. It was also voted one of the top five houses of the year in 1973 in the Australian House and Garden magazine. Mr Lloyd-Jones said that Ms Renzi's additions have 'added to that house in a very respectful fashion and I would say its added to its appeal' The home was voted one of the top five houses of the year in 1973 in the Australian House and Garden magazine . Mr Lloyd-Jones described the house as timeless, 'It feels as though it could have been built today and it will still feel modern in 30 years time' 'It's difficult to write about a house like this unless you've been inside, the recently published articles just don’t do it justice,' Mr Lloyd-Jones said. 'It's one of the most sublime spaces I've ever been in. It's beautiful, relaxing and invigorating - it's an extraordinary space. 'It feels as though it could have been built today and it will still feel modern in 30 years time, it's one of these unique pieces of architecture that truly is timeless.'","The Hollander House was designed to look like a rock and follows the natural formation of the land .

"By . Lillian Radulova . A humpback whale that had been tangled in rope was spotted while swimming just off the coast of Sydney's Bondi Beach on Saturday. The mighty animal appeared to have the right side of his tail caught in an orange rope when it was sighted by Whale Watching Sydney at around 3pm. 'The rope is most likely from some fishing gear. Generally they get trapped in fish traps or crab traps that are dropped along the coast and are usually around 30 metres long with a cage at the end, but sometimes they may have picked up a drift net,' Whale Watching Sydney's manager Will Ford told the Daily Mail Australia. A humpback whale was spotted tangled in an orange rope while swimming just off the coast of Sydney's Bondi Beach on Saturday . It was sighted by Whale Watching Sydney at around 3pm but the group reported that it was 'swimming along fine and didn't seem to be in any stress' 'You can see that the rope is sort of going straight down and its taught, which means it has got a fair bit of gear underneath that it's towing along. If it was just a rope, it would be trailing along, not dragging down.' The tour group reported however, that the animal was 'swimming along fine and didn't seem to be in any stress' when it was first seen. Nevertheless, two of the group's boats stayed alongside the whale while they waited for NSW National Parks and Wildlife to arrive with disentanglement gear and assess the situation. A spokeswoman for Whale Watching Sydney told the Daily Mail Australia that by the time NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service arrived it was already too dark for them to assess and free the whale. A spokeswoman for Whale Watching Sydney told the Daily Mail Australia that by the time NSW National Parks and Wildlife arrived it was already too dark for them to assess and free the whale . An ORRCA spokesperson assured that spotters had been placed from the Central Coast to Port Stephans as of Sunday morning in an attempt to relocate the tangled mammal . An ORRCA spokesperson confirmed that the rescue teams lost sight of the whale, but assured that spotters had been placed from the Central Coast to Port Stephans as of Sunday morning in an attempt to relocate the tangled mammal. It's been a sad migration season for whales across Australia with at least three entanglements off the coast of Sydney as well as one in the north coast where a beaching also occurred. Mr Ford said that the increase in entanglements is not necessarily due to an increase in debree, but could instead be due to the rise in whale populations, leading to a rise in the number of the animals who head to warmer waters along the eastern coast fromm May to mid August each year. 'This year there are over 20,00 humpbacks traveling along the coast and in the past there were only 8,000,' Mr Ford said. 'The numbers have increased, so now you're seeing more incidents of them being beached and entangled, not particularly because there's more fishing gear but because there's more whales coming so close to the coast -but it is a problem.' Another humpback whale was stranded on a sand bank at the Gold Coast earlier in the week, but finally managed to swim its way to freedom two days later . Despite freezing temperatures and the potential danger, the spectators decided to take matters into their own hands by using their combined weight to move the eight-metre mammal as light was fading . Mr Ford said that Maquarie University had begun researching the effectiveness of using 'pingers' on shark nets to ward off sea creatures including whales and thus prevent them from becoming entangled in the rope. However funding for the project, under the Marine Mammal Conservation Initiative, was cut by the Abbott government this year. A humpback whale was stranded on a sand bank at the Gold Coast earlier in the week on Thursday. After a number of devastating failed rescue attempts, the young whale finally managed to swim its way to freedom two days later. Not long before the rescue, another humpback whale had to be freed off the coast of Byron Bay in NSW, after it became entangled in 30 metres of nylon rope.","The whale appeared to be tangled in an orange rope on Saturday afternoon .

The new leaseholders of paradise will be the sole occupants of St Bees Island, which is just off the coast of Mackay, north Queensland.

The new leaseholders will be the sole occupants of St Bees Island which is just off Mackay - north of Brisbane . A Gold Coast family signed a 20-year lease for less than $1 million this week . 'There's not a lot to it, it's quite simple,' Mackay and Marina Real Estate licensee Kim Griffiths told Daily Mail Australia. A Gold Coast woman, her son and partner will be moving to the 1,100-hectare island. However the residential lease covers about 4 hectares as the rest of the land is a national park. Mr Griffiths described the couple, in their 60s, as 'quite eccentrically private'. 'They just had the normal reservations in terms of isolation – when living a metropolitan style life you attach yourself to lifestyle habits but I think they're just looking forward to living a simple island life that most fanaticise of us only fantasise about,' he said. 'They're heading towards the island now and they're bringing up a convoy of boats to potter around on and she's going to grow veggies.'

'The bays the only part of island that’s ever been lived on – just the little beach there,' Mr Griffiths said. 'It just the typical idyllic screen saver with palm trees and all.' The island was originally owned by the Bourke family but the surviving holder of the lease took on some partners and formed a local syndicate of businessmen. 'They used it for family holidays for about 5 or 10 years and then they wanted to go their separate ways and so they put it on the market,' Mr Griffiths said. The Gold Coast family were among hundreds of inquiries which were mostly from Australia and New Zealand but also generated interests from Europe and Asia. 'People inquire because the dreams always there: it reads pretty well, peoples see the photos and think 'wow' – it doesn't get much better cause it's still one of the most beautiful coastal regions of the world,' Mr Griffiths said. The island was originally marketed for a 12 month lease and about three people inspected the island.","A Gold Coast family signed a 20-year lease for St Bees Island which is just off Mackay, north of Brisbane .

"By . Lillian Radulova . and Daniel Mills . Wicked Campervans have continued to fuel the fire surrounding criticism of their controversial slogans and explicit artwork, after they responded with a tongue in cheek interview saying: 'things are much more fun once they've been banned'. The company came into the limelight earlier this week when Sydney mum Paula Orbea launched an online petition with change.org, asking the founder John Webb to 'eliminate misogynistic and degrading slogans and imagery' from their vehicles after her daughter sighted a Wicked Campervan with the phrase 'In every princess, there's a little slut who wants to try it just once'. In an interview with SBS, Leanne Webb from Wicked Campers, formerly known as Liam, feigned surprise when asked about the company's slogans. Scroll down for video . Leanne Webb from Wicked Campers, said the company was not concerned with the criticism it has received over the last few days regarding its controversial slogans and artwork . 'Controversial? Really? I mean, I don't know - we don't try to be controversial. We never try to be controversial, it's not our goal. We just do what we love and we try to have fun,' Leanne said. 'We poke fun at everything more broadly, it's never specifically targeted at anyone in particular at all.' The budget hire company, which has depots around the world, said they were not phased at the bad publicity, despite the online petition currently having over 100,000 signatures. 'We're not worried at all that it will affect business in any way,' Ms Webb told SBS. 'We think it's fantastic, things are much more fun once they've been banned.' The slogan that the 11-year-old daughter of Paula Orbea told her about which led her to start a petition calling for the elimination of 'misogynistic and degrading slogans and imagery' from the vehicles . A litany of complaints have been leveled with the Advertising Standards Bureau against Wicked Campervans for its use of advertising slogans . When describing how the slogans were thought up, Leanne continue to joke around. 'We come up with all of the designs - everyone in the company after many many hours... of drinking water,' she said. SBS also reported that Mr Webb said he was not concerned about the petition, saying it was providing his company with global marketing. Despite taking the bad press in good humour, the fate of the company and their slogans is up in the air, with the Queensland Parliament discussing banning the vans altogether. Promoted as 'budget' travel for tourists looking to road trip through parts of Australia, the hire vans offer travellers fully-functional eat, sleep and drive capabilities. This is perhaps one of the less controversial slogans posted on the rear of a the Wicked Campervan .

There are packages, specials and different sizes and varieties of vans available. Some have slogans while some come without. The company was approached for comment about a litany of complaints leveled against it via the Advertising Standards Bureau, but so far has not returned calls. A foreigner working for the company said Mr Webb was not available on Sunday. Daily Mail Australia counted some 60 complaints - either dismissed or upheld - against the company's use of slogans - including one which was dismissed that read: 'To all virgins: Thanks for nothing.'

"By . Lillian Radulova . Candice Clark was denied financial assistance from the government despite having terminal cancer . A Darwin mother-of-two who was told by doctors she has less than one year to live, has been refused financial assistance from the government. Candice Clark was left in a wheelchair in April this year after a tumour on her spine paralysed her from the waist down. The 22-year-old was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, a bone cancer, four years ago but continued to work as a car detailer in Palmerston until earlier this year. In October, doctors told the young mother that she had less than a year to live and Ms Clark was forced to leave her job as her health continued to deteriorate. She then approached the government and attempted to apply for the Disability Support Pension, but was ultimately told she was not eligible. 'Bloody unbelievable, I have worked most of [daughter] Enjay's life when I could just stay at home on [Centrelink], have worked the last four years, three years full time while I've had cancer when I could have been on disability,' Ms Clark wrote on her Facebook page. The mother-of-two (centre) pictured with family members, was paralysed from the waist down in April from a tumour on her spine . 'Now that I'm paralysed waist down and a cripple I'm not eligible for anything because of Steven, are you serious mate? Have to wait for my super.' 'Should have just lied like everyone else...' Instead, Ms Clark was told she would have to rely on her Superannuation to pay for her medical costs, including her pain killers and a catheter, as her husband Steven's income was considered too high to meet the criteria. She was also denied access to a Health Care Card or a Pension Card. The 22-year-old was told to use her superannuation for her medical costs, but she argues she would prefer to leave the money for her two young daughters (pictured) However Ms Clark told NT News that her family's financial circumstances had changed since the last financial year and she now thinks she is eligible for government support, preferring to leave her superannuation money for her daughters once she's gone. 'Enjay heard me talking to Steven crying and came in and said ""it's OK mum, I'll quit after school care"",' Ms Clark wrote on Facebook. 'My pain killers are like $70-$80 a fortnight and all the [things] I need for my catheter is like $70-$80  a fortnight. I get $600 a year to help with the catheter.' Ms Clark is currently working through her Bucket List which included marrying her partner of seven years and an extended family trip to the Gold Coast.","Candice Clark, 22, was diagnosed with bone cancer four years ago .

"By . Lillian Radulova . The Australian property market is in danger of 'overheating' and rising housing prices could jeopardise the country's economic and financial stability, top ratings agency Moody's has warned. The New York-based ratings agency blamed low interest rates for fuelling rising house prices but said in a regular report on the Australian economy that the trend could not continue indefinitely. '(This) trend poses some medium-term risks as Australia's real estate market appears to be overheating, with both price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios reaching levels well above the historical averages,' wrote Moody's analysts, Steven Hess and Bart Oosterveld. The Australian property market is in danger of 'overheating' and rising housing prices could jeopardise the country's economic and financial stability, according to a report by ratings agency Moody's . 'Considering supply-side constraints, the influx of foreign capital and the fact that monetary policy is set to remain accommodative for the foreseeable future, the housing market appears to be increasingly likely to get caught up in a positive price-feedback loop and eventually could face a correction.' Housing prices continued to rise in the first quarter of 2014 as average year-over-year growth in Australia's eight largest cities inched up to 8.3 percent, marking the highest growth rate in nearly four years. House prices in Sydney rose 16 per cent over the past year, while the Melbourne property market increased to 9.9 per cent, according to RP Data figures released last week. This property in Penrith, in suburban Sydney, sold for $1.2 million. The four-bedroom home was sold late last month . The data revealed average prices for a property in Sydney was now $679,000 and Melbourne house prices are currently estimated to cost $555,000. Moody's report acknowledged that any price fall in the property market would be contained by a lack of supply. 'In terms of volumes, however, rising housing prices have not so far resulted in a construction boom: residential construction activity remains largely in line with demand trends,' the report stated. 'This, along with still historically low leverage levels, strong mortgage buffers, and well-capitalised banking system, limits the impact of a potential real estate market contraction on the broader economy.' This four bedroom Glenmore Park home in western Sydney sold for $675,000 on June 17 . Low interest rates and rising house prices have also led to a resurgence in Australia's renovation market. The Housing Industry Association is expecting $28.6 billion to be spent on renovations after dropping to a decade low last year, leading to financial benefits for retailers and manufactures in the home renovation market. 'After a slow start to the 2013/14 fiscal year, renovations investment has now posted two consecutive quarters of growth through to the March 2014 quarter,' the report stated. 'This provides some confidence for our forecast of 1.0 per cent growth in the total value of renovations investment in 2013/14 to around $28.6 billion.' Growth predictions continue to rise after 2014 with 1.2 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent increases expected over the following consecutive years. If fulfilled, this trend would see a resurgence of the renovation boom experienced in 2013, around the $30 billion figure.","New York-based ratings agency Moody's has blamed low interest rates for rising house prices .

This means no references are allowed in: 'words or letters in English, and/or references to the broader geographic area in which the club is located; and/or colours; and/or references to flora; and/or references to fauna'.

The Football Federation Australia's National Club Identity Policy, released on Thursday, said club's names and logos can't 'carry any ethnic, national, political, racial or religious connotations' FFA boss David Gallop said the new policy was would ensure soccer remained an inclusive but successfully multicultural sport. 'Football is now a part of the mainstream of Australian society and has achieved that status while also retaining its rich diversity,' Mr Gallop said. 'The intent of the National Club Identity Policy is to ensure the game remains inclusive and accessible, not just in the way we organise ourselves, but in how we engage with the community. Sydney's Fairfield-based Marconi Stallions (left) and Sydney United, formally known as Croatia Sydney (right) are two teams which have a strong history of migration amongst their players . 'The very name and logo of a club sends a message about what that club stands for. We want clubs that stand for uniting people through the joy of football.' However the policy was greeted with criticism across social media, with Tweeters suggesting that the new rule is ironically avoiding multiculturalism by banning national association. 'FFA want to be ""inclusive"" by banning anything with ethnic connotations? That's not inclusivity, that's xenophobia,' Andy Cussen Tweeted. 'Unbelievable stuff from FFA. Ethnic clubs in this country represent so much more than just a football team,' another tweeter, Lucas Pavlidis, wrote. Concerns have been raised for teams with strong histories of migration, such as Sydney's Fairfield-based Marconi Stallions who mostly have Italian heritage, as well as Sydney United who were formally known as Croatia Sydney.

Almost 20 years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's, Christine Bryden has defied all odds and stumped medical professionals by defying the disease and living a normal successful life. After being diagnosed with early onset dementia at the age of 46 in 1995, the mother-of-three was devastated by her terminal prognosis. She was told she would need full-time care within five years and would be dead before she turned 60. And yet two decades later, Ms Bryden has reshaped medical thinking about the disease, writing two books, completing a post-graduate diploma and even entering into a new relationship with her partner - all while her brain continues to deteriorate. Christine Bryden was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at only 46 years of age. She has since then astounded medical professionals and beat all the predictions regarding her health . In 1995, she visited a doctor for brain scans after experiencing a great deal of stress and extreme migraines. The then Australian government scientist was told by two separate doctors to leave her career behind as her scans showed that damage to her brain was well underway and would continue at a creeping rate, as is common with dementia. Source: Alzheimer's Australia . They gave her the bleak diagnosis that she would be completely incapacitated and be required to move into a nursing home within five years - and then die three years later. 'It was mind blogging. I was totally horrified, I couldn't believe it could happen to anybody so young,' Ms Bryden told the Daily Mail Australia. 'And then I just felt total horror as to what would face my girls and me in the future - my youngest was only nine and still in primary school. 'What was terrifying was the way I would; die without knowing anything - and that's a really terrible fear to have. 'Somehow its difficult to be brave when you face losing the ability to be brave. But slowly im trying to adapt and its hard work trying to keep going, keep talking and keep thinking.' Despite her emotional turmoil, Ms Bryden refused to simply let the disease take over her mind. She released a book, 'Who Will I Be When I Die', which explores the isolation and the feeling of identity loss experienced by dementia sufferers. Three years after her diagnosis, she even fell in love and married Paul Bryden, who continues to support and encourage her to this day. It was on their first date that Ms Bryden said she told Paul of her diagnosis, but since then 'he hasn't looked back, so we're on this journey together,' she said. 'I call him my enabler, he enables me to keep functioning, rather than a carer which implies doing things for me.' Three years after her diagnosis, she fell in love and married Paul Bryden (right), who continues to support and encourage her to this day . She has also released two books, including Who Will I Be When I Die, which explores the isolation and the feeling of identity loss experienced by dementia sufferers . Ms Bryden has astonished medical professionals across the world, defying even the most positive odds, and has become an active advocate for people suffering from dementia by speaking about her personal experience within the wider social issue. 'There was no support back then. When I rang up association they asked me ""who are you looking after?"" and when I said it was me they said ""we don't have support for you, only for the carer"",' Ms Bryden said. 'I had a nine-year-old girl - how do you explain what you have and what's going to happen? 'She went to show and tell the next day and said ""my mum has a hole in her head"" because that's what it looks like in the brain scan. 'All of that has changed now! I was so upset and passionate to change [the lack of support] at the time.' Despite noting that positive changes since her own diagnosis, Ms Bryden believes there is still more to be done in order to help dementia sufferers lead a normal life in society. 'I'm really passionate about trying to make it better for other people being diagnosed today,' she said. 'I want people to feel brave and I want society to accept us as disabled people amongst us who deserve dignity and respect, not to be shunned and laughed at. 'There are so many jokes out there about old timers disease and ""I'm losing my marbles"". It's so hurtful. people don't realise that it's like saying ""I've got a touch of cancer today"". It's a terminal illness that people joke about.' Ms Bryden has  become an active advocate for people suffering from dementia across the world by speaking about her personal experience with the wider social issue . Christine was appointed Queensland Alzheimers Australia ambassador by Ita Buttrose (left). She was also the first person with dementia to address the international conference of Alzheimer's Disease International . The dementia advocate attributes survival to the immense support she receives from her family, as well as her consistent effort to stimulate her brain and use it in new ways. However, despite Ms Bryden's remarkable journey, the effects of the disease continue to creep in and make their impact. 'I have no idea why I've lasted this long except that I've been trying very hard. But it doesn't matter how hard some people try, it might not necessarily help them because their brain is disappearing too fast. 'My brain is disappearing slowly and therefore giving me a chance to keep going. 'As my brains disappears - and it's definitely disappearing, bit and bits disappear everyday - I have to use different parts and I have to keep trying. I'm rewiring my brain all the time. 'I was functioning at high level to begin with – I am a very determined individual and I do get very exhausted. It would be very easy to just have a quieter life, but I think by putting all this effort in, it's been worth it. Not everyone is as lucky.' Famous in Japan: Ms Bryden's second book, Dancing With Dementia, was written in response to requests for updates on her life and was commissioned by a Japanese publisher . She has done many interviews and documentarys in the last 20 years, and has given talks all over the world including in UK, France, Israel, South Africa, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Taiwan, South Korea and Turkey . Ms Bryden wants to continue inspiring hope within people who are suffering because of the disease, whether patient or carer. Dementia affects over 44 million people worldwide and more than 300,000 people across Australia, with numbers only set to grow as the population ages, according to Alzheimer's Australia. There is still much to be learned about the disease which presents itself in a range of symptoms that affect a person's thinking, behaviour and the ability to perform everyday tasks. 'I just want people to have hope for a future living a new life with dementia – and not to give up and fall into despair,' she said. 'I hope that as a result of all this effort, that people with dementia and their family are encouraged and can overcome that terrible fear and the stigma.'

"By . Lillian Radulova . A $6 million kitchen facility, complete with the latest technology, is to be built at the John Morony Correctional Complex, north of Sydney to feed prisoners across New South Wales and advance their prospects of rehabilitation. The project comes as part of an improved long-term imitative, started in 2001, which has seen prisoners grow their own produce and gain food-handling qualifications. More than 338,000kg of vegetables, 1.5 million loaves of bread, 1.4 million litres of fresh milk and 130,000 kilograms of fresh beef were processed through the state's prisons in the last financial year. A $6 million kitchen facility, complete with the latest technology, is to be built at the John Morony Correctional Complex, north of Sydney . The green-thumbed prisoners, who also grew more than a million apples, have so far saved NSW tax payers over $4.16 million over the 2012/13 financial year, according to the Commissioner for Corrective Services in NSW, Peter Severin. This is a significant saving for NSW correctional centres, where inmate food costs amount to about $17.8 million a year. 'We have whole range of minimum security areas across the state where we grow veges and products and have beef cattle herds,' Commissioner Severin told the Daily Mail Australia. 'We've got a bakery at Long Bay [Correctional Facility] which makes sandwiches and things every day, part of our kitchen operation is at Goulburn Correctional Centre and our main kitchen is at Silverwater [Correctional Complex] – we currently have a whole range of facilities that are part of the decentralised operation. The project comes as part of an improved long-term imitative, in which prisoners, such as the ones pictured at the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre, grow their own produce and gain food-handling qualifications . 'The inmates there are very much involved in training activities from operating machinery to general farming activities, and next part of it this process is that we process that produce for every single inmate we have in the state.' More than 30,000 meals are produced each day across the facilities by up to 600 prisoners, who work in a professional manner while adhering to all safety standards including food control standards. In the 2013/14 financial year, the program is projected to achieve even greater savings of between $5 million and $6 million. The next step of the initiate, involves consolidating the majority of the prison system's inmate-run kitchen operations into the one facility to be built at the John Morony Correctional Complex. Bakery at Wellington Correctional Centre: More than 338,000kg of vegetables, 1.5 million loaves of bread and 130,000 kilograms of fresh beef were processed through the state's prisons in the last financial year . 'This kitchen will employ around about 85 inmates and include a ""cook-freeze"" cutting edge technology and it's a six million dollar project which will occur in about the middle of next year,' Commissioner Severin said. The current produce is cooked and then chilled in facilities before being sent out across the state to be reconstituted by each facility. This method allows food to be preserved for only 2-3 days, while the new 'cook-freeze' facilities will allow for a longer shelf life. 'Spending this money on that kitchen will pay of – it will pay off because the amount it will save is quite considerably large in terms of food processing costs. After that we'll actually have savings,' Commissioner Severin said. A dairy and milk processing unit at Emu Plains Correctional Centre: In the 2013/14 financial year, the program is projected to achieve even greater savings of between $5 million and $6 million . 'Yes, we do spent up front capital, but we do it quite smartly – it improves the outcome for offenders too. We can spend that money that were saving on other on programs and initiatives.' Part of the project's aim is to teach the inmates skills that will assist them in their rehabilitation and provide an opportunity for employment once they leave the prison system. 'Last year almost 600 inmates completed food relates short courses. This is a solid foundation for taking steps in improving the chances of them not re offending,' Commissioner Severin said. 'What we do know through research is that if you do provide a person with ability to gain employment and do that in a way that’s interesting and engaging, it’s a very strong factor to help prevent them from re-offending.' An inmate working in the food services unit at the Silverwater Correctional Complex: Part of the project's aim is to teach inmates skills to assist them in their rehabilitation and provide an opportunity for future employment . Despite strict criteria applying to prisoners who can be selected to participate, maximum security prisoners also have opportunities in the scheme. 'Only inmates who are minimum security are involved in the production and running of beef cattle herds - they work outside secure perimeters. They would be inmates at the end of their sentence, who have proven to be reliable and self responsible and have made significant progress to prove they can live a crime free life,'  Commissioner Severin said. 'In certain locations – in very remote locations – we can have anyone suitable for the task participate. So, further up the line it goes right through to medium and maximum security prisoners participating in some aspects of food production – but this involves risk management. 'We wont have inmates who we don’t trust dealing with food products or knives etc, but given that the cooking arrangements are all undertaken in secure prisons, they have opportunities there.'","Prisoners in NSW correctional centres are currently producing 30,000 meals a day for inmates across the state as part of a new imitative .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Festivalgoers at a bush dance party where a teenager fell from an 80-metre cliff in NSW's Hunter Valley have spoken of the 'terrible feeling' when they found out what had happened. The 17-year-old miraculously survived the terrifying plunge, which police described as 'mind-boggling', in Watagan State Forest, 20 kilometres west of Lake Macquarie, on Saturday night. He fell down the sheer rock face at about 10.30pm on Saturday. He and a group of friends were trying to get into the dance party, which was held to celebrate this year's Winter Solstice. One reveller, who calls herself Bonnie Patzeyclairvoyant Mcmillan, told MailOnline partygoers had 'no idea who he was or his friends'. 'In pitch black conditions all of us were powerless to do anything until daylight but wait together,' she said. Scroll down for video . A 17-year-old was found 'conscious and breathing' by emergency services after falling approximately 80 metres down an escarpment at Freemans Waterhole in Watagan State Forest (pictured) on Saturday . Emergency services and local volunteers abseiled down the cliff about 4am and spent the rest of the night with the injured teenager. 'Everytime there was an update or the rescue team needed something moved EVERY respect was given,' she added. Ms Mcmillan explained that festivalgoers at the Solstium Shadows - A Winter Solstice Bush Gathering tried 'not to cause panic' despite having limited information about what was happenning. She said 'the party remained as normal' until search and rescue teams told them differently. Speakers and DJ decks setup at the 'Solstium Shadows - A Winter Solstice Bush Gathering' party . The teenager was winched to safety about 10.30am and flown to Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital with broken bones and suspected internal injuries and is in a serious but stable condition. 'I don't know how he has survived, and the doctors and the paramedics are saying the same thing,' said a spokesman for the Westpac Rescue Helicopter. Acting Superintendent Murray Lundberg said the teenager's survival was 'mind boggling'. 'I haven't got words to describe his fortunate luck,' he said. The teen was moved to a safe position at the bottom of the cliff where the rescue team awaited a helicopter which winched the youth to the John Hunter Hospital . He said the teenager and his mates were camping in the forest when they came across the dance party and were denied entry. The youth apparently thought he could get into the function from around the back, through the bush, with no lights and no knowledge of the terrain, 'and he's just fallen off the side of a cliff'. A number of trees had to be chopped down before the teen could be winched aboard the helicopter. Ms Mcmillan added: 'I know I speak for anybody who attended that it's a terrible feeling that somebody would be hurt en route to attend anybody's celebration and to be completely unable to help is equally an unpleasant thing. 'To the boy involved, hope you're OK mate and to his fam and friends please don't think your son was not worried about by everyone.' The two-day rave was being held at a site off Rope Road, in the heart of the forest. Ms Mcmillan described how she did not pay any money to attend the party, which she described as an 'annual celebration for music lovers and the chance for non professional entertainers to have their music heard'. The event's online description reads: 'Come play and be jolly like a kid on Christmas at this years WINTER SOLSTICE GATHERING NSW. 'To celebrate this years Winter Solstice, the shortest day and to welcome the start of warmer days for 2014 we welcome you to join us in a gathering of good dudes, good tunes, good vibes and a weekend of Winter.'","Police said the 17-year-old became disorientated at 10.30pm before the fall .

"By . Leesa Smith . A 'professional mistress' who flaunted her glamorous lifestyle on social media, claiming to have been showered by expensive gifts in her role as a charity worker, has issued a tearful TV apology in China after being arrested in a World Cup betting scandal. Guo Meimei had a huge following on Weibo, China's answer to Facebook, as she posted pictures of expensive cars and from exotic locations, claiming the gifts were given to her as part of her job as a  Red Cross senior manager. Scroll down for video . A remorseful Guo Meimei (pictured) concedes it was her vanity that led her to concoct a story that she was a senior manager in a subsidiary of the Red Cross where she was given outlandish 'gifts' as part of the role . In Guo's tearful apology while bowing in orange prison clothes live on TV, she blamed her illicit behaviour on her huge ego . Guo' s lavish lifestyle was being supported by an illegal gambling operation and also working as a professional mistress for Beijing’s rich and famous . Guo confessed to the gambling-related charges which she had been detained for live on television last month which ended the month-long investigation . However, after she was arrested under the country's strict gambling laws, she was forced to confess she was a £30,000-a-night prostitute who had sex with China's rich elite for money and had no connection with the charity. The Red Cross has since struggled for donations since being dragged into the scandal, prompting her to issue an apology on state television, dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit. 'I like to show off,' she said. 'I have the vain mindset of a little girl.' ‘I would like to tell the Red Cross that I’m sorry. I want to apologise even more to those people who are unable to get help.' 'I like to show off. I have the vain mindset of a little girl,' Guo (pictured left and right) admits . Guo (pictured left with a fan) documented her lavish lifestyle on Weibo where she had almost 1.9 million followers . Partial to public apologies, the 23-year-old confessed to the gambling-related charges last month after being arrested after a month-long investigation by a special cross-provincial police unit, the South China Morning Post reported. Guo admitted to operating an illegal gambling venue in Beijing, as well as having sex with men for money. She also confessed to fabricating that she had a 260 million yuan (HK$327 million) gambling debt in Macau in an attempt to get back into the limelight. At the height of her fame - or infamy - Guo had almost 1.9 million followers on Weibo who seemed gripped by her love of luxury resorts, fast cars, upmarket restaurants and Macau’s casino tables. The cyber fame even led her to shoot a self-funded film of her life story last year which detailed how she went from a troubled childhood in Hunan to study at the Beijing Film Academy before becoming entangled in the Red Cross scandal in 2011. The charity, which unlike its counterparts in other countries is linked with the government, has urged donors on its Weibo page ‘to please forget Guo Meimei’.

"By . Lillian Radulova . A nationwide crash of two of the country's largest mobile phone networks has been dismissed as 'less than perfect' by one of the telco's technology experts - and the reason for the meltdown remains unknown. Vodafone and Optus Mobile customers were unable to call or text for several hours on Thursday, with coverage only returning at about 6.30pm. The companies are also yet to confirm how many people were effected. In a statement issued on Friday, Vodafone's Chief Technology Officer, Benoit Hanssen, played down the meltdown - before announcing the company will be providing free data to all of its customers this weekend. 'We know our customers had a less than perfect network experience today and we want them to know we're sorry. We want to make good by offering them unlimited data access all weekend,' Mr Hanssen said. Both Vodafone (left) and Optus (right) have resolved network problems after customers experienced outages on Thursday . In an effort to appease its customers, Vodafone is offering unlimited free data over the weekend . Customers will have access to the unlimited data from midnight on Friday until 3am on Monday, June 23. The statement explained that Western Australia was the first to be hit by the transmission network failure at 11am on Thiursday, before it spread nationally at around 1pm. By 4.10pm, the company guaranteed services were restored across the country, while coverage problems dragged on in WA before being restored at 6.30pm. However, despite Optus customers also experiencing network outages, the telco company is yet to release an official statement. A spokeswoman for Optus told the MailOnline that 'the issue has been resolved for all customers', however the cause of the network failure is yet to be determined and is 'still being investigated'. Optus is yet to release an official media statement about the network outage and is still unsure about the cause of the problem .

The woman was found by a member of the public  at Middle Cove in Sydney's north in February with a pillow, blanket and three plastic containers scattered around her. Police said residents of the affluent suburb had seen the woman, believed to be homeless, walking the streets, but no one knew her name and she had not been reported missing. This woman was found dead by a member of the public at Middle Cove in Sydney's north in February . A post mortem found her death was not suspicious but extensive police inquires and forensic details have so far been unable to determine her identity. Residents who saw frequently saw the woman told police she had been living in the cave for six to seven years, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 'We've checked out most homeless refuges, she's not known to them - which to us is very odd,' Constable Andrew Schepis said. 'She's obviously the daughter of someone. Perhaps there were some family issues that caused them to become disconnected - we're unsure.' The woman had used the name of Jemima Ann King in Queensland in 2002 but they don't believe that was her real identity. Police have released a photo of the woman taken in 2002 in a bid to track down someone who knows her identity. They believe she lived in both NSW and Queensland.

"By . Emily Crane . A young man has admitted to setting a teenager alight in a garage and causing him such horrific burns he had to be placed in a coma. Joshua William Lomas, 21, pleaded guilty in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Wednesday to causing serious harm to Luke Coburn, now 18,  in the garage of the teenager's home, north of Adelaide, in January 2013. Luke's mother, Cheryl Coburn, said outside court that Lomas had chosen to target Luke because he was jealous her son had started dating a girl he liked. Luke Coburn suffered third degree burns to his face, ear and arms when two attackers doused him in a flammable liquid and set him alight . 'I’m really happy that he has decided to plead guilty, he has owned what he did and it’s in his best interests to do that,' Ms Coburn told the Advertiser. She said her son had suffered both emotionally and physically from the attack and wouldn't regain full use of his arm. Luke suffered third degree burns to his face, ear and arms when two attackers, one of which was Lomas, doused him in a flammable liquid and set him alight. He had been in the garage of his home with a friend when the attack occurred and had to be placed in an induced coma. Joshua William Lomas, 21, pleaded guilty in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Wednesday to causing serious harm to Luke in January 2013 . 'We need to know who the other guy is and the sooner we find that out then the better off we will all be,' Ms Coburn said. 'The fact that he hasn’t said who the other fella is yet and everything is just adding on; he needs to own up who the other fellow is and get it over and done with.' Lomas, the only person charged to date, will be arraigned in the District Court on September 1.","Luke Coburn suffered third degree burns to his face and arms after he was doused in flammable liquid in January last year .

"By . Emily Crane . A man whose wife plotted to have him killed on his birthday has revealed the deep scars he was left with after being nearly stabbed to death. Chris Soteriou was in a coma for 10 days following the attack in Melbourne on January 2, 2010, which was orchestrated by his wife of 18 years, Vicky Soterious. Soterious, who is currently serving nine years in jail, had organised for her lover, Ari Dimitrakis, to stab Chris as they walked from a Greek restaurant in Fitzroy to their car 500m away after his 44th birthday party. Scroll down for video . Chris Soteriou was in a coma for 10 days following the attack in Melbourne on January 2, 2010, which was orchestrated by his wife of 18 years, Vicky Soterious . Chris still bares the horrific scars after his wife had organised for her lover, Ari Dimitrakis, to stab him as they walked from a Greek restaurant in Fitzroy to their car 500m away after his 44th birthday party . 'It sends shivers down my spine that the person you loved and treasured organised to kill you,' Chris told Channel 7's Sunday Night. Soterious had preemptively parked the couple's car in a dimly lit street and had organised for her lover to attack when they returned from the restaurant late that night. Despite going missing for 30 minutes during dinner so she could show Dimitrakis where the car was parked, Chris had no reason to suspect what the mother of their three children had planned. As the couple approached the car, Chris said he saw a man crouching down and his wife broke away and went to stand in the middle of the street. It was then Dimitrakis 'slit my throat'. 'There was no feeling. I didn’t feel any pain, I just it was more shock. I just felt the blood run down my chest and felt this warm, warm fluid running down my body,' he said. CCTV cameras captured the couple walking back to their car just minutes before Chris was attacked . ‘I remember saying if I don’t make it just look after the kids. She must have been watching me getting killed in the middle of the street.' Chris only managed to survive the deep stab wounds because two off-duty doctors were nearby and helped to try and stabilise the bleeding as paramedics arrived. ‘I didn’t feel any pain. I went to sleep peacefully. Bright light… it’s all I could see,' Chris said. Ten days later he woke from his coma and was met by his crying wife. On January 15 she went to police and confessed to plotting to kill Chris with her lover after hearing authorities were closing in on the attacker. 'I’ve just come to confess that Ari and I organised it. I know, it was stupid. It was absolutely silly,' she said in a recorded police interview. It was later revealed Soterious had unsuccessfully tried to convince another lover to kill her husband five years before Chris was stabbed . Soterious later changed her mind and pleaded not guilty in court. She was sentenced to a maximum of 12 years. Chris said his wife had given him a birthday card the morning he was stabbed and it was signed 'thank you for loving me so much, the wife that adores you'. In sentencing, the judge said: 'Your husband had provided you with an affluent lifestyle and it appears in the sentiments expressed in the birthday card that you were prepared to have him believe he was loved and appreciated in return. In truth you wanted him dead.' It was later revealed Soterious had unsuccessfully tried to convince another lover to kill her husband five years before Chris was stabbed. After she was sentenced, former lover Tony Aleksovsky said Soterious had offered him $50,000 to murder Chris during their 2005 affair. 'I thought it was a bad joke you know if I thought she was serious I was going to go to the police,' he told the program. 'I said ""If you don't love him, why don't you divorce him?"".' Vicky went to police and confessed to plotting to kill Chris with her lover after hearing authorities were closing in on the attacker. She later changed her mind and pleaded not guilty when she was charged . As a wealthy engineer, Chris had regularly 'spoilt' his wife with lavish and expensive gifts. 'As a divorced husband I was probably worth $3 million, as a dead husband I was probably worth $7 million,' he said. Chris said he has tried to put Soterious' betrayal behind him as he focuses on raising their two young twins. Their teenage daughter cut ties with Chris after her mother told her Chris had plotted his own murder. '(The twins) have asked me where their mother is and that was a result of my little girl seeing my scars,' Chris said. 'She asked who did that and I said ""mummy did it"". They asked where their mum is and I told them ""she’s in jail"". That’s one of the questions I’m challenged with. How do I tell them?' Chris has written a book about his experience. Love You to Death: A Story of Sex, Betrayal and Murder Gone Wrong by Megan Norris (Five Mile Press) is out this week.","Chris Soteriou was in a coma for 10 days after being stabbed multiple times in Melbourne on January 2, 2010 .

"By . Emily Crane . It's the $13,000 bike lane that runs for just 30 metres but the Melbourne council that introduced it says it's a raging success. The European-style bike lane in Hampton, south-east of Melbourne, was introduced last month and allows cyclists to travel in the opposite direction to vehicles. The painted path, known as a contraflow lane, on Thomas Street enables cyclists to travel in both directions for the 30 metres on the one-way stretch of road. Scroll down for video . A European-style bike lane in Hampton, south-east of Melbourne, was introduced last month - it cost $13,000 and stretches just 30 metres . Bayside Council said it hasn't received any reports of confusion by road users, from either cyclists or motorists since the bike lane was introduced. 'A painted bike lane physically separates motorists from cyclists. Signage is also installed to direct cyclists and other roads users of the changed conditions,' the council's director of infrastructure, Steven White, said. 'On-site observations have found that the treatment has also reduced the speed of vehicles turning into Thomas Street from Hampton Street. 'This observation aligns with research from Europe, where contraflow lanes are used extensively in towns with one way streets, that has found contraflow cycling reduces the risks of accidents.' The painted path, known as a contraflow lane, on Thomas Street enables cyclists to travel in both directions for the 30 metres on the one-way stretch of road . Bayside Council says it hasn't received any reports of confusion by road users, from either cyclists or motorists since the bike lane was introduced . City of Sydney Council has four contraflow lanes bike lanes across the city. 'Contra-flow lanes can improve safety for bicycle riders by allowing them choose a route that avoids a busy road or intersection, for example,' a spokeswoman said. 'All run for the full length of the street or for the full length of the one-way section of the street. 'International studies have also shown a reduction in crashes from contra-flow bike lanes. In northern Europe, all one way streets allow contraflow travel by bike unless signed otherwise.' The NSW Roads and Maritime Services department issued a technical direction earlier this year on contraflow provision for bikes, including the recommendation that 'councils assess existing one-way streets for suitability for contra-flow bicycle facilities'. 'Bike lanes keep riders safe – research by Transport for NSW shows that separated bike lanes have doubled the number of cyclists on the road but led to fewer total injuries among them,' Sydney's Lord Mayor Clove Moore said. The number of daily bike trips in the City of Sydney local government area has increased from 25,868 in March 2010 to 60,098 in March 2014, according to the council's independent research. 'Even a completed network of separated cycleways could not cover every street and road. Bike riders have the right to use our streets and roads, and as more people choose to ride other road users need to be aware of how vulnerable bike riders and pedestrians are,' Ms Moore said. Signage has been installed to direct cyclists and other roads users of the changed conditions, the council says . It comes as Bicycling WA, a cyclist activist group in Perth, has called on its government to reduce speed limits on suburban roads from 50 to 30km/h as part of its strategy to double the number of cyclists by 2020, the West Australian reports. Jeremy Murray, Bicycling WA's chief executive, said with more riders on the road, bike lane infrastructure was necessary to avoid accidents. In the past 12 months, the number of cyclists being treated at Perth's trauma unit has risen 45 percent, with doctors saying the severity of injuries increasing. 'The worst injuries we've had are people getting run over by trucks, dragged under them... some are losing limbs, having muscles ripped off bones,' the State Major Trauma unit director, Sudhakar Rao said. Mr Murrary said the figures were concerning and there was often a misconception in terms of a rider's rights. 'They are legally allowed to ride two abreast, they are allowed to be on the road,' he said. 'But there are also behaviours that cyclists are involved in... you get them doing stupid things on the roads, not indicating, riding without helmets.' But not everyone is as thrilled as the council about the new bike lane with some taking to social media to vent their concerns .","A $13,000 bike lane just 30m in length has been built in Melbourne .

Unemployed Australians under 30 years of age will need to send a number of job applications to potential employers every month to avoid their Newstart payments being cut off under the government's proposed employment and welfare changes.

Players from the winning Waratah's side were out in force at Bondi Beach on Sunday as they lapped up their 33-32 win from the night before. The all-day drinking session saw a number of teammates crowd the Bucket List bar as they kicked back and toasted their long-awaited win. Scroll down for video .

Bernard Foley scored the long-range three-point penalty to win the match 33-32 for the Waratahs to take out the Super Rugby Championships for the first time in 19 years. It was a case of third time lucky for the Blues, who have been losing finalists twice before. Just minutes after the final whistle, the thrilling win prompted fireworks to erupt over the Opera House. The final was an awesome treat for the almost 62,000 fans - a Super Rugby all-time record - and the biggest crowd for a NSW home game in more than a century.

Blues fans were holding their breath as the Waratahs were on the brink of a third painful finals defeat when the team squandered an early 14-point lead. But Foley’s 23-point contribution from a conversion and seven penalties and a two-try effort from veteran centre and man of the match Adam Ashley-Cooper proved just enough to deny the seven-time champions from Christchurch. The Crusaders paid the ultimate price for flanker Richie McCaw's ruck infringement which paved the way for Foley to  kick the winning goal with just seconds left on the clock. The man of the moment - Foley - said he had been working on his long kicks and gave it everything to get the ball between the posts from near the halfway line.

Bill Shorten lashed out at Joe Hockey during a fiery speech to 1,000 Labor party supporters at its NSW conference at Sydney's Town Hall on Sunday . Their critics seized on the footage saying it showed the government was out of touch with everyday Australians facing deep budget cuts. 'This arrogant, cigar-chomping treasurer, his hopeless story, reveals that it took Tony Abbott to block him from deeper, harder cuts,' Mr Shorten said. 'Seriously. If it's up to Tony Abbott to tell you that you've gone too far, you've well and truly gone too far.' The Labor leader said the government was 'unravelling from the centre and rotting from the top'. Shorten called Joe Hockey an 'arrogant, cigar-chomping' federal treasurer in reference to when he was filmed smoking cigars outside Parliament House before the budget . 'This is a budget brought to you by a conservative Prime Minister who doesn't see it as his duty to care for everyone,' he said. 'By a conservative treasurer whose personal comfort in life has robbed him of charity, and, I might say, judgment.' Much of Mr Shorten's speech focused on Labor's support for Medicare amid Mr Abbott's plan to impose a $7 Medicare co-payment. He said it was 'madness' for Australia to adopt a United States-style health system, just when Americans were 'finally making a long and exhausting U-turn'. The Treasurer's critics seized on the footage saying it showed the government was out of touch with everyday Australians facing deep budget cuts . On party reform, Mr Shorten urged Labor to 'rebuild as a party of members, not factions'. Mr Shorten has been calling on the ALP to change its rules so that party members no longer be required also to be union members. On Saturday, the conference supported a plan to give ordinary members a 50 percent say on who becomes state Labor leader.

He's the determined young koala who survived an 80km ride clinging to the front grille of a car in Queensland - and remarkably escaped with just a bruised nose and scratch toe nail. The four-year-old koala was hit on Thursday around Marborough, north of the Sunshine Coast, and was spotted still hanging onto the car when it pulled into a service station at Gypmie 88km away. A taxi driver took the 5.75kg koala from the driver of the car and drove him to a nearby vet clinic, before he was taken to Australia Zoo on Friday to be treated. The four-year-old koala (above) nicknamed Timber Wolf, was hit on Thursday at Marborough, north of the Sunshine Coast, and was spotted still hanging onto the car when it pulled into a service station at Gypmie 88km away . The zoo's vet, Dr Rebecca Millers, said she's never seen such a tale of koala survival in her three years at Australia Zoo. 'He's clung on to the front of the car for about 80km. It's incredible that he's survived,' Dr Millers told Daily Mail Australia. 'The driver felt a thump on the front of the car but kept going until they reached Gympie when they needed to fill up with petrol. They've got out of the car and a koala has crawled out.' A taxi driver took the 5.75kg koala (above) from the driver of the car and drove him to a nearby vet clinic, before he was taken to Australia Zoo on Friday to be treated by vets such as Rebecca Millers . Dr Millers said the koala had been named 'Timber Wolf' because he was brought to the zoo by the men who collect leaves for the animals. She said the furry marsupial would have been hit while he was searching for a mate. The zoo treats about 900 koalas each year and most of them injure themselves between July and December when they're on the move searching for a mate during the breeding season. The furry marsupial would have been hit while he was searching for a mate but remarkably only suffered minor injuries . 'He’s recovering well but we need to know where to return him.

"By . Jill Reilly . Richard Campagna, 36, was chased through Legoland water park when he was drunk . Police used a Taser on a drunk man who led them on a 30-minute chase around a Legoland water park before telling them his name was Pterodactyl when he was eventually arrested. Richard Campagna was chased through the Florida amusement attraction on Wednesday. Police were called after the 36-year-old, who had arrived at the park alone and appeared to be drunk, refused to leave Legoland. Ignoring staff's instructions he instead ran into the park's lazy river which was 'occupied by a large number of children,' the Sheriff's Office said. During the course of the subsequent chase he splashed water on an officer. Police decided to try and stop Campagna using a stun gun, but their attempt was unsuccessful because only one of the probes stuck into Campagna. He pulled it off and continued to run, but was eventually arrested by several officers, reports The Ledger. When detectives asked him his name, he told them, 'Pterodactyl,' according to The Ledger . Campagna was booked into the Polk County Jail in lieu of $1,750 bail. He now faces charges of battery on a law enforcement officer, splashing water on a deputy, disorderly conduct and resisting officers without violence. No-one in the park was injured and Campagna did not need medical attention after being corralled.

"By . Leesa Smith . An openly gay African man planned to attend the AIDS 2014 conference in Melbourne with the aim to seek asylum in Australia because he fears for his life back in his homeland. The successful retail business owner decided to pay about $3220 to a man who organised his trip to Melbourne after his shop was looted three times with the final incident being done by the police themselves - where he was also beaten. The man, who is married to a woman who knew about his sexuality and who he recently had a child with, said he was left with no choice but to leave his family behind. Scroll down for video . About 25 African International AIDS Conference delegates are seeking asylum in Australia . ‘I said I did not want to leave without my family, but I could do nothing,’ he told The Age. ‘Even if you go to the police, they say, ‘In this country you cannot [be gay]'.' The man, who wished to remain anonymous due to concerns for his safety, is anxiously staying at a city backpacker hostel, with up to 25 other anxious African conference delegates seeking protection from persecution in their homelands. The five-day conference finished on July 25 and delegates from countries including Tanzania are are in crisis accommodation after refusing to leave Australia, while their visas have reportedly expired or are due to imminently. One of the delegates, who preferred to remain anonymous, said his work with people with HIV and albinos in his native Tanzania had put his life at risk after, reported the ABC. Tanzania has one of the highest rates of albino murders in the world, often a result of witchcraft killings. Receiving death threats, the delegate said he was nearly killed by a group of people who chased him as he drove home from watching soccer game. 'So I got a very bad accident ... almost like dying. They wanted to kill me. After that crash, they disappeared completely because so many people came to give me help,' he said. Believing the Tanzanian Government will not be able to protect his safety or similar incidents from happening, the delegate plans to lodge his asylum application later this month. Pamela Curr of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre confirmed the group of delegates was seeking advice about gaining refugee protection in Australia . He said he decided to seek asylum in Australia due to its human rights 'reputation'. A spokesperson of Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the government would assess each claim for protection based on individual merit and in compliance with the law. Pamela Curr of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said the group of delegates was getting advice about gaining refugee protection in Australia, because they come from countries where AIDS-related work had put their lives at risk. 'It seems that some of them have been considering whether they think they can survive in their countries of origin, or whether they should try to survive by getting refugee protection in Australia,' she said. She said the delegates' visas had either already expired or were due to and that it was not the first time conference delegates have tried to gain refugee status in Australia. 'When people have come from countries where their daily lives are threatened by violence and politics, and they come to Australia and take a deep breath, walk down the street, and know that no one is going to kill them. It's a very intoxicating freedom,' she said. Ms Curr said this is not the first time conference delegates had tried to get asylum in Australia . Ms Curr said this is not the first time conference delegates had tried to get asylum in Australia and that in the past, delegates had been granted asylum because their claims were considered strong under refugee protection. Calling a refugee visa one of the 'hardest' to get in Australia, she said the current delegate's claims would be assessed as per the refugee convention. If found to have a claim, Ms Carr said she wants to see protection offered to the delegates by the government. Crisis accommodation service HomeGround CEO Heather Holst said the organisation had helped find shelter for 14 of the delegates after they sought help. She said while the organisation was not involved in the asylum seeking process, they could provide support with finding a place to stay.","An openly gay African man refuses to leave Australia because he fears for his life back in Africa .

"By . Jill Reilly . A Malaysian MP has been slammed for tweeting 'Long live Hitler' after Germany's victory last night against Brazil. Kinabatangan MP Datuk Bung Mokhtar Radin posted on the microblogging site via the Twitter handle @MyKinabatangan: 'WELL DONE..BRAVO...LONG LIVE HITLER.' The tweet in the early hours of this morning went viral and internet users have condemned Bung for his reference to the Nazi dictator and demanded he issue an apology. A Malaysian MP tweeted 'Long live Hitler' in a bizarre tweet after Germany's victory last night against Brazil . 'I don't know what's wrong with people sometimes. Hitler is part of history and the German team fought like how he did,' said Kinabatangan MP Datuk Bung Mokhtar Radin . But in his subsequent tweets to his 21,000 followers, Bung, a self-professed fan of the team, seemed unrepentant. He re-tweeted the abuse he received - when one user asked how he manged to get elected he replied 'coz I'm better than u', while he told another user to 'get lost.' Today he insisited he was commending the German football national team for 'fighting like' Hitler in their 7-1 win against Brazil in the semi-finals of the World Cup. 'I don’t know what’s wrong with people sometimes. Hitler is part of history and the German team fought like how he did,' Bung told English news portal The Star Online. The Sabah MP also insisted that his tweet was 'just for fun'.

'I think people nowadays should transform their mentality. Whatever I tweet, people hit me. 'They are not hitting me because of Hitler, but because I am Bung Moktar,' added the Umno supreme council member. German laws forbid Nazi symbols, denial of the Holocaust and public expressions of support for Hitler. And today Germany’s Ambassador to Malaysia said the comparison was 'unacceptable'. In a statement emailed to The Malay Mail Online, . Holger Michael said the embassy 'strongly rejects' the reference. 'While . we appreciate the admiration for the German football team, we strongly . reject the unacceptable allusion to the fascist regime of Adolf Hitler,' Michael said. In his subsequent tweets to his 21,000 followers, Bung, a self-professed fan of the German team, seemed unrepentant . The Sabah MP also insisted that his tweet was 'just for fun' In one tweet the MP told a user he as elected 'coz I'm better then u' Today DAP . chief Lim Guan Eng said Bung's comment was a slur to Germany rather . than a compliment, and falls foul of the country’s denazification laws. 'Bung Moktar should know that if he was to say this in Germany, he could go to prison for supporting Nazism,' Lim said at a press conference. The embassy declined to comment on the severity of the salute for Hitler, which can constitute a crime in Germany reported The Malay Mail Online. But his comments continue to anger netiziens. One user posted: 'I cannot brain how an MP can actually say ""long live Hitler"" in 2014. And in support of a German team so far off from Hitler's ideals.' While another tweeted 'Stop with the hitler jokes and comments. it's not a thing to take lightly. it's a football game, nothing to do with Germany's past.' Germany has laws to restrict neo-Nazi propaganda and Nazi symbols are banned. Bung Mokhtar became an MP since 1999 and is no stranger to controversy - he has previously been  criticised for his insensitive statement on women, race and other issues.","Kinabatangan MP Datuk Bung Mokhtar Radin has been slammed for tweet .

"By . Jill Reilly . US advisers in Iraq risk assassination by troops they are trying to train, according to a classified report. Americans who are assigned to advise Baghdad’s forces could be at risk because so many units are  deeply infiltrated by . either Sunni extremist informants or Shiite personnel backed by Iran, the report by United States detailed. If the US does decide to assist in moving back the the advances made by Sunni militants in northern and western Iraq over the past month, the assessment concludes that only about half of Iraq’s operational units are able to carry out the push. Shi'ite volunteers, who have joined the Iraqi army to fight against militants. US advisers in Iraq risk assassination by troops they are trying to train, according to a classified report . The report says Iraqi troops are dependent on Shiite militias -  US troops battled agasint Shiite militia after it invaded Iraq and this could also be a danger, reports The New York Times. Last month the U.S. and Iraq on reached a key agreement on legal protections that will enable up to 300 special operations forces to deploy in the country. 'They will be very good at improving the immediate tactical proficiency of some of the Iraqi military, but they will be less prepared to address the long-term health of the Iraqi army,' said retired Lt. Gen. James Dubik, who was in charge of training Iraqi forces in 2007 and 2008. With the army's northern divisions hard hit by desertions as key Sunni cities fell in June, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shi'ite-led government has leaned heavily on Shi'ite militias and volunteers motivated by a sense of religious duty . In essence, he said, the U.S. teams will be 'sharpening the tip of the spear, but not replacing the rotted staff with a new one.' In a string of battlefield victories, the Sunni militants have captured several key towns in the north and on the border with Syria, sending Iraqi troops fleeing. Abandoned by military leaders who may have felt alienated by the Shiite-led government, troops ran, leaving their weapons and equipment. 'It's a rapidly deteriorating situation,' said Rick Nelson, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies/ . 'It's a hot war. They have to get in and help stop the bleeding to get the Iraqi forces to be able to maintain stability and security in the country.' Brig. Gen. Darsie Rogers, head of Army Special Forces Command, said Green Berets currently are conducting training missions in 30 countries and do so in more than 150 nations each year. Highly trained in special warfare and counterinsurgency, the teams routinely are used to help other countries build and improve their militaries. Rebel fighters from the Islamic Front, Syria's largest rebel coalition, hold a position during clashes with militants of the Islamic State (IS), formerly known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), for the control a village on the outskirts of Aleppo . The latest Iraq mission, Rogers said, is more akin to what special forces have been doing in Afghanistan and the Philippines and what they did in Iraq during the war years. But it's a bit larger than similar missions going on around the world, including a number of countries in Africa. Rogers, who served in Iraq, said the assessment phase will be important in determining how to go forward but, 'having some experience with that, I think that we will rather quickly understand where we need to apply our assistance.' The teams will determine how the U.S. can best help the Iraqi forces, then the additional teams will deploy. They are expected to help the Iraqis improve their military systems and commands, but not embed with the fighting units or engage in direct combat. Iraqis stand over the debris of a house after an air raid by Iraqi Air forces in Fallujah city . Rogers also noted that a number of U.S. special forces have served in Iraq. 'The relationships that we have with the Iraqis, at least those that I had while I was there, were very strong, and I'm sure that we'll be able to capitalize on this as we go back in,' Rogers said. Still, Dubik said that while the commandos will provide important short-term help for the Iraq forces, they will not be sufficient to solve the problem. Instead, he said Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki needs to make several critical political moves, including disbanding the office of the commander in chief, which has been blamed for roiling sectarian divisions and pushing a Shiite agenda. U.S. officials are also pressing for a government transition that will better empower the minorities and bring the country together, thus conceivably avoiding a civil war. The legal agreement was needed to get the special forces into Iraq. Iraq Shiite fighters with the 'Peace Brigades' patrol during a sand storm on the outskirts of Samarra . Iraq Shiite fighters patrol on the outskirts of Samarra, 60 miles (95 kilometers) north of Baghdad, Iraq. Fighters of the voluntary armed group formed after the radical Shiite cleric Muqtatda al-Sadr called to protect holy shrines against possible attacks by Sunni militants . Islamic extremists have destroyed at least 10 ancient shrines and Shiite mosques in territory - the city of Mosul and the town of Tal Afar - they have seized in northern Iraq in recent weeks . The Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said Iraq had outlined acceptable legal assurances for the short-term mission in a diplomatic note ensuring that troops will not be subject to Iraq's judicial process. Instead, if there are any problems, troops would be subject to the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice. The legal protections are similar to those provided to U.S. diplomats and troops working out of the embassy, officials said, . White House spokesman Josh Earnest drew a distinction between the current situation and the administration's desire to have the Iraqi parliament approve immunity for American troops when the U.S. was looking to leave a residual force behind in 2011. Iraq refused to sign that agreement and the U.S. pulled all but a small number of forces out of the country in December 2011. Fewer than 200 troops, largely providing security, have remained at the U.S. Embassy as part of the Office of Security Cooperation. 'We're dealing with an emergency situation — that's the first part — and there is an urgent need for these advisers to be able to do their work on the ground in Iraq,' Earnest said, adding that they are going in at the request of the Iraq government. Officials also noted that the force being sent in now is much smaller than the several thousand that the military planned to leave there after 2011.","Many units are deeply infiltrated by Sunni informants or Shiite personnel .

"By . Jill Reilly . A van belonging to a Michigan-based physician who bore the notorious nickname 'Dr. Death' has been found at a pawn shop. Dr. Jack Kevorkian used the 'Deathmobile', a 1970s VW Minibus while assisting in several deaths, including the poisoning of an Alzheimer's patient that launched his public effort in 1990. It is being stored at a pawn ship in Southfield, Detroit, where Les Gold of American Jewelry & Loan bought it for $20,000. A van belonging to a Michigan-based physician who bore the notorious nickname 'Dr. Death' has been found at a pawn shop . Kevorkian served eight years in prison for second-degree murder after administering a lethal injection rather than helping the patient do it himself . The bus is currently sitting at the shop on layaway - the new owner, a local businessman, is paying $25,000 for the bus, reported CBS Detroit. 'There’s the registration’ we have his driver’s license, we have the pictures,' said Mr Gold. 'We have every document to show that this was actually the van that he used for assisted suicide.' Dr Kevorkian was released from prison in 2007 after serving eight years for a second-degree murder conviction after assisting in the 1998 death of a 52-year-old Michigan man with Lou Gehrig's disease. His parole came under the condition that he would not offer suicide advice to any other person. He said his ultimate goal was to create 'obitoriums', where people would go to die - and doctors could harvest their organs. The van is being stored at a pawn ship in Southfield, Detroit, where Les Gold (pictured) of American Jewelry & Loan bought it for $20,000 . The bus is currently sitting at the shop on layaway - the new owner, a local businessman, is paying $25,000 for the bus . He rose to infamy in the 1990s with his homemade 'suicide machines', which he drove to patients in a rusting VW van. He inserted a needle into the patient's arm, then they pressed a lever to release the fatal chemicals. The first assisted suicide he made public was in 1990, when Janet Adkins, 54, became the first person to use the machine at her home in Portland. But his luck ran out in 1998, when he taped himself injecting Thomas Youk, who had Lou Gehrig's disease, with lethal chemicals. The tape was then broadcast on CBS's 60 Minutes, and led to his conviction. Speaking on the programme, he said: 'The issue's got to be raised to the level where it is finally decided.' He was charged four times with murder, but three juries acquitted him and then a third case collapsed in a mistrial. As the state tried desperately to stop him, Dr Kevorkian likened himself to Martin Luther King and Gandhi and called prosecutors Nazis, his critics religious fanatics. He burned state orders against him, showed up at court in costume, called doctors who didn't support him 'hypocritical oafs' and challenged authorities to stop him or make his actions legal. He once said: 'Somebody has to do something for suffering humanity. I put myself in my patients' place. This is something I would want.' Dr. Jack Kevorkian in Jackson State Prison in Michigan in 1999. He was charged four times with murder, but three juries acquitted him and then a third case collapsed in a mistrial . In 2010 online auction site eBay removed a listing for the van saying the sale would violate the company's policy against the sale of murder-related collectables . In an interview recorded from prison, he later admitted he regretted his actions 'a little'. He said: 'It was disappointing because what I did turned out to be in vain. 'And my only regret was not having done it through the legal system, through legislation, possibly.' After his release from jail, he revelled in his newfound celebrity. In 2010, his life was chronicled in 2010 telefilm You Don't Know Jack, starring Al Pacino as Dr Kevorkian. The film, which also stars Susan Sarandon and John Goodman, follows Dr Kevorkian as he builds the second of his suicide devices, the 'Mercy Machine', which employed a gas mask fed by a container of carbon monoxide. Pacino won Emmy and Golden Globe awards for his portrayal of the doctor, who sat smiling in the audience as the actor paid tribute to him in his acceptance speech, saying it was a pleasure 'to try to portray someone as brilliant and interesting and unique.' But although he liked the film, Dr Kevorkian had little hope it would help inspire a new generation of assisted-suicide campaigners. Dr Kevorkian demonstrates his euthanasia kit . He said: 'You'll hear people say, ""well, it's in the news again, it's time for discussing this further."" No it isn't. It's been discussed to death. 'There's nothing new to say about it. It's a legitimate ethical medical practice as it was in ancient Rome and Greece.' In 2008, he ran for Congress as an independent, receiving just 2.7 per cent of the vote in the suburban Detroit district. He said his experience showed the party system was 'corrupt and has to be completely overhauled from the bottom up'. In 2011, he died peacefully and pain-free from ongoing kidney disease, aged 83. In 2010 online auction site eBay removed a listing for the van saying the sale would violate the company's policy against the sale of murder-related collectables. Mayer Morganroth, Kevorkian's friend and lawyer at the time said Kevorkian turned the van in to his own auto shop for scrap in 1997 and that he was upset it had been put up for auction. 'Jack never sold it, never got a dime for it,' Morganroth said. 'Jack believed it was destroyed.'

"By . Jill Reilly . Nong Kaem, 13, was raped and murdered on an overnight train in Thailand . A 13-year-old girl was raped and murdered on an overnight train in Thailand before her body was shoved on to the tracks. Nong Kaem went missing on Saturday night as she slept during a return journey with her sisters from the southern province of Surat . Thani to the capital, Bangkok. Her body was discovered three days later near the train tracks in Prachuap Khirikhan . province's Pranburi district according to police. The route is popular among backpackers traveling back from Thailand's island and beach resort destinations. 'She wanted to be an angel, she wanted to be an air hostess,' Nong's mother said today. 'If she was still here I would do everything to support her, but now I have nothing left.' Her sister wrote on Facebook: 'Kaem, I am so sorry that I failed to look after you. I am a terrible sister. Please forgive me,' she wrote, according to the Bangkok Post. Police have charged a 22-year-old train cleaner with rape and murder. A police spokesman said in a televised statement Wanchai Saengkhao had confessed to taking drugs before committing the crimes and throwing the girl's body out of the train. Today he was taken back to Wangpong train station where the same train Nong Kaem travelled on was stopped for a re-enactment. He told police he had been drinking with other employees when he left them and switched off the light in the car before he climbed into the girl's bed. Saengkhao said he strangled her until she passed out and raped her. He said that she regained consciousness during the horrific attack, but he strangled her again. He took her iPhone and iPad before pushing her body out of the train window. Her body was discovered three days later near the train tracks in Prachuap Khirikhan province's Pranburi district according to police (file photo) He told police he then took her her bag and sat in the train until it arrived in Bangkok. Saengkhao confessed to the crime after he was tracked down via his victim's mobile phone. Wanchai sold the girl's phone to a shop owner in Bangkok, who took a copy of his I.D. which was later passed to police. He faces charges of rape, concealing a body and murder, which carries the death penalty. He also allegedly confessed to raping two other women reported the website. On Instagram, Thai entertainment stars and celebrities joined the chorus of calls for the law to be changed to make rape punishable only by death. Convicted rapists now face a sentence of four to 20 years in prison and a fine. Nonthawan 'Maeya' Thongleng, the recently-crowned Miss Thailand World 2014, displayed a poster on Instagram calling for a change in the law and commented: 'I've always thought of this. I want it changed already. Be more strict, please.' A petition on the online social movement website Change.org that called on Thailand's military leader to make such a legal change attracted nearly 15,000 signatures within one day. Thailand's army ousted an elected civilian government in May. 'The offenders, once arrested and sentenced, usually get pardoned and released from jail. And when they get out, they commit the crime again and again to the point that judicial power in Thailand is no longer sacred,' the petition read. Col. Winthai Suvaree, a spokesman for the ruling junta, said its leader, Army Commander Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, urged the authorities to quickly prosecute the perpetrator and called on the relevant agencies to seek extra safety measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring. 'We must call a meeting with every side involved and will have to revise our recruitment process,' State Railway of Thailand governor Prapas Chongsa-nguan told The Associated Press.","The body of the girl was discovered early Tuesday morning in grass .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Jill Reilly . Dramatic video has emerged of the moment the owner of a dog shot dead by a policeman searching for a missing boy confronted cops over the killing. Sean Kendall, 27, berated the officers only minutes after his dog was shot in the head last week by a Salt Lake City police officer. The one responsible for the shooting wasn't there, but that did not lessen Kendall's anger. 'You guys killed my dog. I’ve had this dog for three years – he was my best friend, and he was shot because an officer couldn’t back the f**k up out of my house,' Kendall shouted at the cops. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Confrontation: Sean Kendall angrily shouted at the police officers standing in his front yard after his dog Geist was killed . The video starts with Kendall driving home after finding out his dog had been shot dead. It was created less than 20 minutes after the dog died. His hands tremble with emotion as he confronts the cops and goes on a profanity-laced tirade. 'Which officer shot my dog? Please,' Kendall asks the officers standing in his front yard in the footage first made public on his Facebook page. 'We were looking for a lost child,' said one of the cops. 'And that gives you probable cause to enter a private residence without permission from the owner?' Kendall fired back. The distraught man then asked for their names and badge numbers, as well as that of the one who killed his dog. The officers on the scene identified an Officer Olson as the man responsible for killing the Wimaraner. Killed: Sean Kendall's two-year-old Weimaraner, Geist, pictured here, was shot dead last week by a Salt Lake police officer . The gate: This is where Kandall believes the police walked uninvited into his backyard . 'He was threatened by the dog, so backing up slowly and leaving the residence is not an option?' Kendall asked, later adding 'is that against policy? Is that against training? 'Did the officer at least have the decency to kill him in the first shot so he didn’t suffer? Or do I have multiple gun wounds in what I consider my child?' Kendall continued. The officer apologized and explained that the dog threatened the officer - while on its own property. 'So I gotta bury my dog because an officer couldn’t back up and close the f*****g gate… what happened was wrong.' Kendall reportedly met with Salt Lake City police officials earlier this week to discuss the fatal shooting of his two-year-old Weimaraner, Geist. Police were searching for a three-year-old boy named Kelby who had been reported missing - he was eventually found asleep in his own basement. Furious: Kendall only becomes more angry as he talks about the officers killing his dog while walking into his backyard . The yard: Kendall insists the officers had plenty of time to slowly back out of the yard instead of shooting the dog dead . Police said . the officer who was searching in Kendall's yard felt the dog was . aggressive and going to attack him, and that's why he shot the animal. Now . Kendall is calling for the officer to be fired from the force, saying . he is 'extremely frustrated and upset' at the apparent reluctance of the . police to take action against the officer who shot his dog. 'The only thing that I would be satisfied with is having this officer terminated,' Kendall told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'I feel that his judgment was completely inappropriate.' Kendall told KSL that Geist had never been aggressive or lunged at anybody. 'The idea that he attacked an officer — it just doesn't make sense,' he added. Angry: Sean Kendall, 27, (right)  met with Salt Lake . City police officials this week to discuss the fatal shooting of his . two-year-old Weimaraner, Geist, seen left here playing . Response: Kendall is calling for the officer who shot his dog to be fired from the force, saying he is 'extremely frustrated and upset' at the reluctance of the police to take action . Another case: A Baltimore police officer was suspended in a case in which he and another cop allegedly slit a dog's throat. Owner Sarah Gossard said her dog Nala, pictured, went missing and she had been trying to track the Shar-Pei down . 'I . believe my dog came out of the dog kennel to see what was going on, who . was here, stopped right here, and those were his last moments.' Kendall said Geist had a single gunshot wound to the head. 'Just the sheer sight of seeing my dog there — it was traumatizing,' said Kendall. 'Now he's dead. I have him wrapped up in a blanket in the back of my truck, and now I have to go bury him.' Kendall’s attorney, Brett Boulton, said he believes his client should be compensated. 'Dog killer': Baltimore police officer Jeffrey Bulger, 49, was booked Wednesday on charges after slitting the throat of a dog in police custody . But Sgt. Greg Wilking said the officer did not break the law when he entered Kendall’s backyard. 'There are extenuating circumstances,' said Wilking reported The Salt Lake Tribune. 'A child is missing, and if you’re a parent, you would want us to look everywhere for your child. We wouldn’t want to leave any stone unturned.' Earlier this week a second Baltimore police officer was suspended in a shocking case in which he and another cop allegedly slit a dog's throat. The Baltimore Sun reported that officer Thomas Schmidt has been placed on a paid administrative leave along with fellow officer Jeffrey Bolger who has been charged with animal cruelty. The pair allegedly held down and cut the throat of a Shar-Pei, with officials saying there was no reason to kill the dog if it was already restrained. Schmidt is a 24-year veteran of the Special Operations Section, serving alongside Bolger who was hired in 1992. The union did not provide information regarding the terms of Schmidt's suspension. The alleged attack happened on Saturday morning in Brewers Hill, a south-eastern district of the city, after police responded to a report of a woman being bitten. Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said officers gained control of the animal, a seven-year-old Chinese Shar-Pei, with a dog pole and an officer used a knife to cut the dog's throat. Late last night, Detective Jeremy Silbert issued a statement identifying that policeman as Bolger. Announcing that internal affairs were investigating the killing, Mr Palmere called the incident 'outrageous and unacceptable'. Witnesses told police that as Bolger got out of his vehicle, he said: 'I'm going to f*****g gut this thing.' He waited until colleagues got control of the dog before bending down and slashing its throat with a knife, witnesses said. It bled to death before animal control arrived, police told the Baltimore Sun.","Sean Kendall's two-year-old Weimaraner, Geist was shot dead last week by a Salt Lake police officer .

The father-of-three said: 'It has been fantastic since we rolled out the skateboard' 'It is an idea I had two years ago. Initially the idea got some laughs for years, but this year it seemed like a good idea as the chief wanted us to get out of our cars and engage with the public more. 'I told him about this idea I had and the chief said just go out there, don't get hurt and we will see what happens.' And in a first of its kind anywhere in the world, Officer Zwicky now hopes to introduce a full unit consisting just skateboard cops. He added: 'The long board has opened up a niche for law enforcement that hasn't been explored before.

Green Bay Police Captain Bill Galvin said: 'We have one-man cars. He's a one-man skateboard. 'Just like officers walking a beat, this is an extension of that.' And Officer Zwicky's colleagues say they couldn't believe him when he first mentioned the idea. Capt. Galvin added: 'At first, I've got to admit, I was like, seriously?' 'But when he explained more how he wanted to get into the parks and spend time with kids, it made sense.'","Officer Joel Zwicky, 40, rides around on a Green Bay police board .

Healthcare assistant Sophie McGarry, 21, faces claims she took items including a gold Krugerrand coin, a chain and bracelet from patients at the hospital over a seven-month period. She was flanked by her parents at the hearing in Scarborough, North Yorkshire in which the prosecution claimed she stole several thousand pounds worth of goods from patients at Scarborough Hospital. The nurse will now appear at York Crown Court next month over the accusations. The charges relate to allegations of theft across the Graham, Chestnut and the Ann Wright wards, as well as the Stroke Unit. In total, she faces 13 counts of theft by finding, along with a further charge of theft. McGarry, of Scarborough, who entered no plea ,appeared alongside Liam Andrews, of Burnley, Lancashire who is alleged to have handled the £1,100 bracelet the Crown Prosecution Service claim the nurse stole. Andrews, 24, entered a not guilty plea to his sole charge of handling stolen goods. The nurse was first arrested in November 2013 then bailed, before she was arrested again as subsequent charges came to light. She is currently suspended from her role at Scarborough Hospital pending both the outcome of the court case, and an internal NHS probe.

"By . Jill Reilly . Uriah Gardner, 16, as jailed for 14 years for stabbing a teenager to death . A teenager who murdered a student because 'gangster rap made him want to kill' was jailed for at least 14 years today. Uriah Gardner, 16, plunged a knife into the chest of 17-year-old Fico Dougan with such force that it emerged from his back. Gardner launched the unprovoked attack at a house in Croydon, south London, in the presence of a two-year-old girl. The teenage killer had been listening to rap music in the hours before the attack, and admitted the violent lyrics made him want to ‘stab up someone’s face’. Without warning, Gardner grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Fico as he sat on the sofa watching TV. He dumped the knife in a drain and fled the scene on a bus before trying to burn his jeans in his back garden. Psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph, who has examined some of Britain’s most dangerous killers, described Gardner as a ‘budding psychopath with a potential for violence’ during his trial. Gardner was today sentenced at the Old Bailey and ordered to serve at least 14 years in custody before being considered for release. The court heard he has a previous conviction for sexually assaulting a girl when aged just 12, and has a string of convictions for robbery, theft, assault, and criminal damage. Judge Stephen Kramer said: ‘You deliberately picked up the knife, you went to the lounge with it and deliberately used it in anger to kill Fico. ‘It was a senseless killing of someone you had only met and been with for a few minutes. ‘You have deprived a family of a much loved son, grandson, and brother.’ The judge said an independent psychiatric assessment had found Gardner was not mentally ill, but had some of the traits of an emerging personality disorder. Victim: Fico Dougan, pictured right with his sister, was stabbed through the chest . Murdered: The court heard how Mr Dougan, pictured above, had done nothing to provoke his attacker . Fico died from a stab wound to the heart soon after the attack on September 25 last year . Gardner, wearing a black Brooklyn logo t-shirt, showed no emotion as the sentence was passed, with the victim’s family watching on from the well of the court. Mother Sandra Opoku said in a victim impact statement: ‘Trying to deal with the shock of losing our wonderful, beautiful son has been heartbreaking and very, very distressful for all of us. ‘We struggled to find the meaning for the senseless manner for which our Fico was taken away from us. ‘The initial shock of it all has now given way to the reality that Fico has been killed by someone he did not offend and had no chance to defend himself. ‘We are living with numbed emotions because we are struggling to be strong for each other and suppress the pain and sense of injustice. ‘How can we ever forget what happened when we are surrounded by memories of Fico day in and day out. ‘Fico was very unique in his own way.’ Fico died from a stab wound to the heart soon after the attack on September 25 last year. On the day of the attack Gardner visited his 19-year-old sister and her friend Montana Riley at a house in Ockley Road, Croydon. Scene: Tributes were left outside the location of the murder in Croydon, South London . He was listening to music on his headphones and said: ‘When I listen to rap music I want to stab somebody’. Fico, who was going out with Miss Riley, arrived at the house and was watching TV with them. The killer suddenly left the room with a ‘vague stare’ on his face and went into the kitchen. Shortly afterwards he burst into the living room holding a large kitchen knife and without warning attacked Fico who was sat on the sofa. Fico’s girlfriend desperately tried to stop the stabbing as Gardner attempted to lash out another five or six times with the knife. She was screaming for him to stop but he paid no attention. Heartbroken: Mr Dougan's parents, Sandra Opoku and Ernest Dougan. Mrs Opoku said: 'Trying to deal with the shock of losing our wonderful, beautiful son has been heartbreaking and very, very distressful for all of us' Miss Riley said: ‘He came out of nowhere and leapt over his sister to get to Fico. 'He was just stabbing Fico constantly. I tried to get between them and stop him. ‘He looked like he was trying to stab his face so I had my hands over his face and his heart. ‘I was trying to talk to Fico and to see if he was breathing but he wasn’t responding. His eyes had rolled back.’ Miss Riley told detectives the teenager had been listening to music on his mobile phone in the hours before the attack. She told them: ‘He said, “When I listen to depressing songs I feel depressed, when I listen to love songs I feel sexually frustrated, and when I listen to rap music I want to stab up someone’s face”. ‘He started clenching his fist. I thought it was weird but you don’t think he actually would. He did not look serious.’ Fico, who had been studying for a BTEC in Business Management at John Ruskin College, suffered a 14cm deep wound to the chest which passed all the way through his body, penetrating his heart. He also suffered a stab wound to his left armpit and a cut on his left arm and was pronounced dead at hospital at 3.15pm. Gardner fled the house after the attack and dropped the knife down a drain before getting a bus home. Neighbours spotted him trying to burn clothing in the back garden and he told them it was ‘stuff that was not good enough to take to the charity shop’. Gardner denied murder, but was convicted after a one-week trial.","Uriah Gardner, 16, plunged a knife into the chest of 17-year-old Fico Dougan .

The children turned up at school looking forward to sports day today and it has been postponed. 'Everyone understands these travellers need to go somewhere but for god's sake leave school playing fields alone.

"By . Jill Reilly . A Polish thug told a judge to ‘f***’ off through an interpreter as he was jailed for Tasering a robbery victim in her home. Marcin Stecki swore from the dock at Judge John Lodge as he sentenced him to 13 years and eight months for a 'illogical, motiveless and disturbing' attack. Earlier he shouted: 'Hurry up. Have you finished yet? You better finish off real quick,' - translated by a taxpayer funded interpreter at Basildon Crown Court, Essex. Marcin Stecki, left, swore from the dock at Judge John Lodge, right,  as he sentenced him to 13 years and eight months for an 'illogical, motiveless and disturbing' attack . He and accomplice Jacek Cupial - both wanted for violent crimes in their native Poland - bound and gagged their victim, Kim Hyde, aged in her 50s, and zapped her in the head, chest and body with a Taser gun while demanding cash. She told police officers she thought she was going to die during the horrific incident at her home in Woodside, Leigh, Essex. She managed to wrestle the gun off her two attackers and attempted to stun them with it, but they overpowered her during the terrifying incident. A CCTV pic shows Marcin Stecki   and Jacek Cupial. Pretending to be gardeners the pair barged into the house and attacked Mrs Hyde with Stecki putting her in a headlock and forcing her to the floor to keep her still . Stecki, was jailed for 13 years and eight months for aggravated burglary, possession of an offensive weapon and assault yesterday. His accomplice, Jacek Cupial, received 13 years and one month for his part in the incident, at an earlier hearing. Both are wanted on international arrest warrants for violent crimes in their native Poland and will return there after serving their sentences. The officer that investigated the horrific incident, Det Con Mark Sawyer, from Southend CID, described it as one of the most 'illogical, motiveless and disturbing' cases he has investigated during his 12 years as a police officer. Kim Hyde, aged in her 50s told police officers she thought she was going to die during the horrific incident at her home in Woodside, Leigh, Essex (general view pictured) A detective has praised the bravery of Mrs Hyde claiming her resiliance probably saved her life. Det Con Mark Sawyer, from Southend CID, said the fact she fought back against the men may have saved her. He said: 'It has been a long process to get this case to this point. 'The attack itself was horrific. 'I have been a police officer for 12 years and a detective for CID for five years and I have never heard of or investigated an incident so serious, so motiveless and with so little logic behind it. 'It is important for me to pay tribute to the bravery of the victim in this case. 'Her resilience and the strength she found on that day to fight back against her attackers saved her life.' Mr Sawyer said the pair were intent on committing crime. He added: 'The most disturbing part of this incident is that Stecki and Cupial travelled to Essex prepared. 'They brought the tape and the stun gun. They were not just opportunists..' He added: 'I am extremely pleased with the sentence given to Stecki and Cupial. 'Not just because it shows how serious this case was, but because it will hopefully give the victim some peace of mind that these two criminals are off the streets and that justice has been done.' Catherine Bradshaw, prosecuting, told the court that Ms Hyde had been at home when Stecki and Cupial knocked at her door, and speaking in broken English offered to do garden work on July 24 last year. Mrs Hyde told them she had a gardener, but struggling to understand the pair, went to close the door so she could telephone her husband and check if he had employed them. But the pair barged into the house and attacked Mrs Hyde with Stecki putting her in a headlock and forcing her to the floor to keep her still. They then bundled her into a bedroom where Stecki put his hand over her mouth, told her to be quiet and shoved her face into the carpet. He then took out a taser gun and zapped her head, chest and body. Ms . Bradshaw said: 'She was extremely scared, she was screaming and . struggling for her life. Mrs Hyde thought she was going to be killed. 'When she saw them take the throw she thought she would be suffocated.' The pair then began shouting 'money' at Mrs Hyde while striking her on her head and body. Mrs . Hyde managed to wrestle the Taser gun off the pair and attempted to . stun them with it, but they over-powered her, took out a roll of gaffer . tape and wrapped it around her head to cover her mouth. The court heard the pair then began opening drawers in the bedroom before making off. At a previous hearing it was heard that Stecki only took £50 during the incident.

Player of the tournament: Arjen Robben (5 games, 3 goals) The Flying Dutchman has been his side’s stand-out player, terrorising defenders in each of their five games. He scored two fine goals against Spain in their first match and was also on the scoresheet in the 3-2 win against Australia. At 30, it seems Robben has got quicker with age, and his pace, particularly on the counter, has been pivotal to Holland’s progress thus far. VIDEO Scroll down for Netherland's team profile and qualifying highlights . Wing wizard: Arjen Robben celebrates reaching the semi-finals after scoring three goals during Holland's campaign . Tournament highlight: Demolishing Spain . Four years ago the only thing that stood between Holland and the World Cup trophy was Spain. A goal from Andres Iniesta in extra-time won La Roja the trophy in South Africa. There was redemption for Arjen Robben and Holland in their match against Vicente Del Bosque’s side this time round, as the Bayern Munich winger and Robin van Persie tormented Iker Casillas and his defence. Both scored twice. Spain never recovered from that emphatic 5-1 defeat in Salvador, exiting the tournament at the earliest opportunity having failed to win any of their group games. Deadly: Robben puts Holland 2-1 up against Spain during their spectacular 5-1 victory in Salvador . Lowlight: Nigel de Jong’s injury against Mexico . The holding midfielder was forced off nine minutes into the Oranje’s last-16 clash with Mexico after suffering a groin injury, ruling him out of the rest of the tournament. A mainstay in the Dutch starting XI for years, De Jong’s absence has been felt in midfield, with no like-for-like replacement capable of replicating his tenacious style. Ruled out: Nigel de Jong was unavailable against Costa Rica after being forced off with a groin injury against Mexico . Best goal: Robin van Persie v Spain, 5-1 group stage, Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador . On the brink of half-time - with Spain 1-0 up - Daley Blind played a stunning crossfield ball from the left to van Persie. The Manchester United forward repositioned himself brilliantly to throw himself at the pass and connect with a diving header rather than attempting a volley. His improvised effort lobbed the stranded Casillas as prompted chaotic celebrations in the Dutch dugout. The comeback had begun. Up and over: Robin van Persie loops a header of Iker Casillas to equalise against Spain at the Arena Fonte Nova . VIDEO Van Gaal hopeful on Van Persie fitness . How has the boss performed? Brilliantly. Van Gaal has never had a problem telling people how great he is and now . he has proved himself on the biggest stage of all.

"By . Charlie Scott . Follow @@charliefscott . Arguably the player of the tournament before kick-off, Arjen Robben's World Cup ended with a poor display in Sao Paulo, as he was thwarted at every turn by Javier Mascherano. The Bayern Munich winger was Holland's standout performer in the group stage, scoring three times in three games to send Louis Van Gaal's side through as group winners - but he failed to have an impact on proceedings at the Corinthians Arena, with Argentina going through to the final on penalties. Below, Sportsmail takes a look at how Robben fared against a steely Argentine defence... VIDEO Scroll down to watch animation of flying Dutchman Arjen Robben .

Seconds later he controls a great lofted ball by Dirk Kuyt but the flag is up and play is brought back. 12mins – Mascherano dispossesses Robben with a smart sliding tackle on the right, but the ball falls straight to the feet of Wesley Sneijder, who smashes a shot wide from 25 yards. Block: The Dutchman creates a yard for himself but Pablo Zabaleta recovers well to stop his cross . Swamped: Argentina's defenders crowded Robben out whenever the ball went near him . Not happy: Van Gaal had a couple of angry exchanges with his star player during the match . A rare touch: Robben touched the ball just six times in the opening 45 minutes, two of which were throw-ins . HALF-TIME: HOLLAND 0-0 ARGENTINA . Robben touched the ball just six times in the first half - the Holland goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen had 20 touches - and also made just one successful pass. If that wasn’t bad enough, two of his touches were to take throw-ins on the right-hand side and another was after receiving the ball back from a team-mate from one of those throws. Needless to say, his impact in the opening 45 minutes was minimal, as the likes of Javier Mascherano and Pablo Zabaleta stuck close to him and nipped in front to steal the ball before it ever reached him. 49mins– .

Robben cuts inside and holds the ball up so his team-mates can catch up with him, before sweeping a pass out to Wesley Sneijder on the left. 74mins - The Bayern winger is resorting to drifting from one side of the pitch to the other in search of the ball. Unfortunately for him, a number of passes towards him have been wildly overhit. 75mins - Flicks a pass into the path of the overlapping Daley Blind, who whips a cross into the box that Robin van Persie is unable to acrobatically direct towards goal. Help me: Robben made some decent runs in the second half but his team-mates failed to find him . 83mins - Whips his first cross of the evening straight down Sergio Romero's throat. 86mins - Demichelis prods the ball off Robben's toes as the Dutch attacker tries to cause some damage on the left with minutes left on the clock. 90mins - The best chance of the game falls to Robben as the clock ticks into added time. Sneijder flicks the ball to his side on the edge of the Argentina box and Robben steams past and takes it with him. His next touch takes him wide of Romero's goal but he is still able to get a shot away - only for Mascherano to throw himself in front of the strike and put the ball behind. Through on goal: Robben bursts into the box and sends a shot goalwards with his left foot . Brilliant block: Mascherano thwarts Robben by diving in front of the Dutchman's shot . Big chance: Robben puts his hands to his head after his shot is blocked by Mascherano in the 90th minute . END OF NORMAL TIME: HOLLAND 0-0 ARGENTINA - After an unusually quiet 89 minutes from Robben he had a glorious opportunity to win the game. What stood in his way was Javier Mascherano, just as he had done all night. The Argentina midfielder threw his body in front of Robben's shot, which ensured normal time ended goalless. 96mins - Takes the captain's armband from the departying van Persie and immediately produces a flash of brilliance, dinking the ball between Demichelis and Zabaleta, somehow following it through the gap and then winning a corner off the legs of Mascherano. Argentine sandwich: Robben retrieves the ball after slipping it between Zabaleta and Demichelis . 99mins - Thumps a fizzing shot at goal that Romero gratefully gathers in his arms.

James Ward-Prowse of Southampton, Chelsea midfielder Nat Chalobah and Norwich winger Nathan Redmond will be given a break and head coach Southgate is happy to take responsibility if eliminated. ‘We don’t want to pick up any unnecessary injuries, so we’ve got to respect the clubs and the welfare of our players,’ he said. ‘The only difficulty of the tournament is that there’s just one day between games. It is impossible for the lads who have played three games to play again. If I was a club manager and saw my player playing three games in five days, I could understandably say we were negligent if they suffered an injury. ‘We will have to make seven changes. If we get through, we’d do the same again. But we couldn’t ask James and Nat to play (against Colombia). To do that would be asking for trouble. We’ve got to trust the rest of the group to get the result we need.’ A game against either France or Portugal in Avignon on Sunday would be beneficial with Euro 2015 in mind, and Southgate added: ‘The chance to play better sides is even more important.

Robert Palmer, 37, was sentenced by Hamilton County Municipal Judge Cheryl D. Grant, who last month convicted him on two misdemeanor counts after a nonjury trial. Palmer, 37, and his girlfriend Tamica Lynn Jeffers, 33, of Dillsboro, Indiana were arrested after the fire department in Green Township responded to a call about two unresponsive adults March 9. Robert Paul Palmer, 37, and Tamica Lynn Jeffers, 33, of Dillsboro, Indiana were jailed on child endangerment charges after shooting up at an Ohio McDonald's. Palmer has been sentenced to 6 months in jail . Authorities say one Jeffers was unconscious and not breathing, and Palmer was conscious but unresponsive. They recovered from what police say were 'life-threatening overdoses' of heroin. Jeffers was taken to Mercy West Hospital and later released. Authorities say the couple admitted taking the drugs while with a five-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy. Attorney Michael J. Trapp said Palmer hopes to serve his time and then begin picking up the pieces of his life. 'My client is very sorry that this happened,' Trapp said after the sentencing. However, prosecutors said he showed little appreciation for the seriousness of his actions. Palmer will get credit for time served since his arrest, meaning he has a little less than five months left in jail. His girlfriend, Tamica Jeffers, 33, is scheduled for a nonjury trial April 21 before a different judge.

"By . Dominic King . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Tim Howard remembers the moment he peered out into a filthy grey Mancunian day and saw a gifted young novice blossoming into a superstar. It was in the autumn of 2003 and training had finished at Manchester United’s Carrington base. Most of Sir Alex Ferguson’s squad had headed for sanctuary but Cristiano Ronaldo remained out in the elements, running with a ball at his feet, practicing and refining his repertoire of tricks. Ronaldo may divide opinion for such things as appearing on the front of Vanity Fair, the manicured good looks, the rippling torso and a perceived desire to be the centre of attention but one thing beyond question is his current standing as the best footballer in the world. VIDEO Scroll down to see Tim Howard and Cristiano Ronaldo 'Risk Everything' Friends reunited: Tim Howard will come up against former Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo when Portugal take on the United States at the World Cup on Sunday night . Must win: Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal need to beat the US after their humiliation by Germany in the opening game . As Everton goalkeeper Howard explains, that tag is only possible because of the relentless work he used to put in a decade ago when the pair – who will look horns on Sunday night when the United States and Portugal square up in Manaus – had made their respective moves to Old Trafford. ‘From day one he had the flash and the flare but there was always something there and his work ethic was second to none, it really was,’ Howard explains. ‘That is the one thing I tell everyone who is around him. 'Everyone sees the underwear commercials, the girlfriends and the cars but, trust me, his work ethic is incredible. On the ball, in the gym, eating the right food. You know, I just remember every day after training it was always the same. Devotion: Ronaldo on the training ground with Portugal, fine-tuning aspects of his game . Trademark technique: Ronaldo has always put in the extra hours on the training ground in his pursuit of perfection . ‘Carrington is so big, there are acres and acres, so the perimeter is massive. But he would just go out after training and dribble the ball in the rain – doing his step-overs, the ‘Cruyff’ turns, all the things you see on television. He hadn’t honed his free-kick (style) back then, that came later. ‘But he’d run with the ball at his feet around whole the perimeter, working on his own. It is no secret then. It is no surprise that this is how he has ended up. Not everyone does that. He is incredible.’ Yet he is also on the brink of elimination. This maybe an outstanding World Cup but another of its headline acts is in grave danger of leaving the party early and Ronaldo will be eliminated if Portugal lose to the USA and Germany beat Ghana.

Ronaldo looked helpless as Portugal were pummelled 4-0 by Germany in their opening game and there no doubt the feisty Americans, who are thriving under the guidance of one-time World Cup winner Jurgen Klinsmann, have the capabilities to take advantage of any lingering hangover.

The 24-year-old put the finishing touches to his move at the Magpies’ North Tyneside training base on Wednesday. But despite being Monaco's top marksman last term, very little is known of Riviere. Here, Sportsmail tells you more... VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Riviere joins Newcastle United . Another one! Newcastle have added to their French contingent with the signing of Emmanuel Riviere . Well then, who is he? Riviere is a 24-year-old striker – born on the French-ruled Caribbean island of Martinique - who has played for France at every level up to and including under-21, where he scored six times from 15 appearances. What is his club record like? Since moving to Monaco in January of last year for a fee of around £3.5m, he has proved a one-in-three striker, returning 17 goals from 50 outings. He helped the cash-rich club to promotion in his first season but was in and out of the side last time around. His record before moving to the principality wasn’t quite as impressive goals wise; 19 from 85 for first club Saint-Etienne and 10 from 47 for Toulouse. How did he do last season? Well, he was Monaco’s top scorer in Ligue 1 with 10 goals – he bagged six in six at the start of the campaign - as they finished second to PSG. To take that prize he beat off competition from World Cup Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez and his Colombian compatriot Radamel Falcao, both of whom scored nine. Falcao, in fairness, missed the second half of the season with a knee-ligament injury but Riviere still netted his 10 from just 19 starts. VIDEO Riviere joins Newcastle United . Competition: World Cup Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez is Monaco's star player . Price tag: The striker cost United in the region of £6m . What sort of player are Newcastle getting? The first thing to mention is his blistering pace and a lot of Riviere’s goals have seen him spring clear of the last defender. He is a physical type and can mix it with his minders as well as leaving them in his wake. He has likened himself to Thierry Henry, so clearly doesn’t want for confidence and self-belief. Any weaknesses? It is said his finishing could be improved but, on the evidence of last season, he has started to sharpen that side of his game and nine of his goals were sniffed out inside the penalty area. There was one effort against Stade Rennais, in particular, where he rolled his marker before hooking into the far corner, leaving the goalkeeper with no chance. Strength: Riviere has a blistering turn of foot and enjoys a physical battle . Where will he fit in at Newcastle? United’s lack of striking options – they have the out-of-favour and out-of-form Papiss Cisse and Spanish youngster Ayoze Perez – means they’re likely to start with one up front next season and that man should be Riviere. At 24 his best years are ahead of him and Newcastle scout Graham Carr has a proven track record of unearthing gems from Ligue 1. How did he end up in the North-East? Riviere has never hidden his desire to play in the Premier League but, having talked of a ‘dream’ move to Arsenal, it was Newcastle, Stoke and West Brom chasing his signature this summer. Monaco, with the fit-again Falcao, World Cup star Rodriguez and Dimitar Berbatov ahead of him in the pecking order were willing to sell and United matched their £6m asking price.","French striker is Alan Pardew's sixth signing of the summer .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap  Reporter . San Francisco General Hospital nurses failed to act on a doctor's order to maintain a constant watch on Lynne Spalding, the British patient who was found dead in a stairwell 17 days after going missing from her hospital bed. Citing the results of a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services investigation, The San Francisco Chronicle claims a doctor instructed staff in writing that the 57-year-old was never to be left unattended. The report contradicts the account hospital officials gave after Spalding's body was discovered. They said nurses were instructed to check on Spalding every 15 minutes. Both the hospital and the Sheriff's Department share in the blame for the death of Spalding, whose body was found in a stairwell more than two weeks after she vanished from her room September 21. Lynne Spalding, 57, was missing over two weeks before a worker stumbled across her decomposed body in the stairwell of San Francisco General Hospital . The hospital, along with the Sheriff's Department, have been found to share in the blame of Lynne Spalding's death, with nurses failing to keep proper watch of her . Family and friends spent days distributing these flyers all over San Francisco, believing the hospital had properly checked the premises and that Lynne Spalding had wandered off into the streets . She was admitted to the hospital on September 19 for a bladder infection and disorientation. A day later she wandered into a nursing station saying she worked at an airport, with a doctor reminding a nurse that Spalding required around-the-clock observation. On September 21 she vanished. The hospital said both they and police conducted a thorough search of the premises looking for Spalding. Her body was eventually found by a maintenance worker on October 8, more than two weeks after she went missing. The stairwell where she was found was never searched. The probe was conducted by state health inspectors on behalf of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services - the federal agency that decides whether hospitals meet minimum standards to be eligible for Medicare payments - and involved interviews of dozens of hospital staffers and sheriff's deputies. The report has not been publicly released but was obtained by The Chronicle. It found 'systemic' failures at the hospital and said officials there never worked out an emergency plan with the Sheriff's Department. Lynne Spalding officially died of dehydration and liver problems associated with alcoholism. Medical examiners were unable to determine exactly when she died after being missing for 17 days . That created the risk of a 'chaotic and poorly coordinated' response that led to Spalding's death, the report said. The hospital and Sheriff's Department have both said they are making changes to avoid a repeat of what happened. 'Many of the changes outlined in the (report's corrective plan) already have been implemented, and we can assure Ms. Spalding's family, and all our patients, visitors and staff, that we are a safer organization today,' hospital officials said in a statement to The Chronicle. Haig Harris, the Spalding family's attorney, said the report revealed a startling number of breakdowns. 'This defies logic that the sheriff blames the hospital and hospital blames the sheriff and nobody did anything to find Lynne Spalding,' he said. Hospital officials told the investigators that they have long wanted to replace the Sheriff's Department and contract out for better security, but have been barred from doing so by the Board of Supervisors every year since 2009. The probe concluded that the hospital's inability to upgrade security alone resulted in the death of Spalding, 57, who had been admitted for treatment of a bladder infection and for being disoriented. But the hospital itself bears plenty of blame for what happened to Spalding, the report said, starting with nurses' failure to carry out written orders two days before she vanished: ""NEVER leave patient unattended."" An autopsy found Spalding died of dehydration. She also had liver problems related to alcoholism. The autopsy was unable to determine her time of the death, but found it was several days before she was found. Her family and friends spent days distributing flyers around the city, believing she had wandered off from the hospital and that the hospital had been properly searched.","Lynne Spalding, 57, a British expat living in the US, was admitted to San Francisco General Hospital on September 19, 2013 .

Lincoln Hoshino says he wasn't aware of the lawsuit but that he considers similar claims Weir made earlier to be baseless. Houston died on February 11, 2012. The Los Angeles County Coroner determined that she died of accidental drowning, with cocaine use and heart disease as contributing factors. Weir’s lawsuit alleges that as the senior patrol sergeant on duty, he 'attempted to secure and preserve the scene of the death' and had placed a sheet over Houston's body to 'prevent contamination' before Nutall arrived and removed it 'to an area below the pubic region', NBC reported. Police cars and security personel gather at the back entrance of the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills where singer Whitney Huston was found dead earlier on February 11, 2012 .

Loic Remy was poised to join until he failed a medical at the weekend and another striker is top of the agenda. But their recruitment thus far has been impressive. Forget any argument over value for money – fees are almost an irrelevance for the top clubs – the players they have brought in have undoubtedly strengthened Rodgers' squad. Adam Lallana is proven Premier League quality and will add craft as well as graft to the starting XI. Former Southampton comrade Rickie Lambert is a shrewd acquisition who, if used sparingly as expected, will be desperate to impact when called upon. Another Saint who marched out of St Mary's in the direction of Anfield is Dejan Lovren, and his influence at the back could yet prove the most telling. New recruit: Liverpool signed Southampton captain Adam Lallana for £25million in July . Emre Can amplifies options in the middle of the park but it is the signing of Lazar Markovic which excites more than the others. Fans love something of the unknown and the 20-year-old Serb – blessed with a turn of foot and locker full of tricks - could well be the surprise package of the Premier League season. But with that, of course, comes the risk of a settling-in period, given his tender years he would be forgiven as much. At Everton, however, the re-signing of Gareth Barry and Lukaku – last season's loanees – comes with no such danger. Lukaku scored 16 times last year, plundering 17 the season before at West Brom. Many have baulked at a fee which will rise to £28m, but don't forget this boy only turned 21 in May. Completing Everton's new arrivals is Muhamed Besic, the 21-year-old Bosnia midfielder who signed for £4m from Ferencvaros. Tidy, tireless and tenacious – as he showed at the World Cup – the prospect of him, Barry and James McCarthy forming a midfield triumvirate is an exciting one. Back to stay: Gareth Barry (centre) has also made his move to Everton permanent after a loan spell . The Old Boys . As much as we may celebrate Liverpool's new signings, they have, of course, arrived to the backdrop of Suarez's departure. And, putting aside bites and bans, to take away 31 goals leaves a huge void – just look at Spurs and the effect Gareth Bale's absence had on their subsequent campaign. For no matter the fee received or the manner of its reinvestment, you simply cannot replace Suarez. You can try to compensate for his loss and that is what Rodgers will do, but there will be points lost this season from matches in which Suarez would have salvaged at least one and often three. Everton, meanwhile, have lost none of their key players. Moreover, they have secured the long-term future of Ross Barkley and kept Leighton Baines at Goodison. Huge blow: Liverpool will be without Luis Suarez next season following his £75million move to Barcelona . Young gun: Everton's talented midfielder Ross Barkley (right) recently signed a new four-year-deal . The Mainstays . New signings, naturally, will take centre stage when the action gets underway. But, invariably, it is those already in residence who make the difference. Everton have a stellar blue-chip brigade; Tim Howard, Seamus Coleman, Phil Jagielka, Sylvain Distin, Baines, McCarthy and Kevin Mirallas. Likewise, however, Liverpool; Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge the England quintet who were central to their title tilt last term. In fact, it is hard to pick weakness when assessing their respective squads. A composite XI, you feel, would make for one helluva good side. Repeat performance? Daniel Sturridge (left) scored 21 league goals for runners-up Liverpool last season . The Managers . There is no need to separate analysis of this pair; young, bright, innovative, fearless, shrewd and respected. There you have it, both clubs should have no worries over the men at the helm. Thumbs up: Roberto Martinez has proven a success as Everton boss following his debut campaign . The Commitments . Both enter European competition at the group stage – Liverpool the Champions League, Everton the Europa League. That means the guarantee of six midweek fixtures and – were they to make it all the way to the final – a further seven matches for Liverpool and nine for Everton. It is thought that Liverpool's unlikely title shot last season was aided by their absence from Europe. The addition of such strain this time around is the reason why many observers have already written off their Premier League aspirations. Everton, of course, did not have to worry about continental distraction last year either and the Europa League – with its Thursday-Sunday pattern – has historically had a worse effect on a team's domestic season than the Champions League. Food for thought? Brendan Rodgers will have to balance Liverpool's domestic and European ambitions . The Fixtures . The first two visitors to Goodison are Arsenal and Chelsea. Daunting or a chance to put down an early marker? They did, do not forget, beat Chelsea early last season and kicked off with a home victory over Manchester United 12 months previous. The first Merseyside derby arrives as early as September 27 at Anfield, and Everton travel to Old Trafford on the back of it. Liverpool, meanwhile, open at home to Southampton but are then handed away days at champions Manchester City and Spurs. A title cannot be won in August, but a few bruising defeats can leave you licking your wounds and off the pace. Tough start: Everton face Arsenal (both pictured) and Chelsea in their opening Premier League fixtures . The Verdict . Twelve points was the difference between the rivals last season. Liverpool, minus Suarez and with the added exertion of Europe, will not, you suspect, better their tally. Everton, with a settled squad and the permanent addition of Lukaku, should improve. Still, however, you would back the Reds to shade it and finish on top in the battle of Stanley Park. Either way, it promises to make for an intriguing season once more.

"By . Ap  Reporter . A thunderstorm that brought sorely-needed rain to drought-plagued California is winding down after sending mudslides down foothill communities, flooding roadways and opening up sinkholes. Evacuation orders remained in effect for hundreds of homes in Los Angeles County foothill communities where recent wildfires have burned away vegetation that holds soil in place, and bursts of rain caused occasional debris flows. The storm marked a sharp departure from many months of drought that has grown to crisis proportions for the state's vast farming industry. However, such storms would have to be much more frequent to make major headway against the drought, weather forecasters say. The heavy band of rain drenched parts of the state throughout Saturday before tapering off by nighttime. While the danger of mudslides was subsiding, officials urged residents who left their homes as much as three days earlier to stay away until Sunday morning. 'The good news is that it looks like the storm will pass,' Assistant Chief Steve Martin of the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.

The skies are clearing: Oscars organizers say they are expecting sun for tonight's Academy Awards, however remain 'prepared for anything' 'But we still need to evaluate the safety of the area before people can return home.' The National Weather Service said the storm is forecast to move east over the Rockies and into the Plains and Mississippi Valley through Sunday, bringing a hodgepodge of precipitation. Colorado's ski resorts could see up to 6 inches of fresh snow. A mixture of sleet and snow in Kansas, Missouri and Illinois will eventually change over to all snow - with up to 8 inches forecast for Kansas City and the St. Louis area - while northern Arkansas will see freezing rain. The system also has its sights set on the Appalachians and the East Coast into Monday. The storm's eastward move on Saturday finally broke a 70-day streak without precipitation in the Phoenix area. An 85-day spell of no measureable rainfall in Las Vegas ended Friday. Rain and snow also finally came to drought-stricken New Mexico. In Denver, a highway pileup involving more than 100 vehicles killed one person and injured 30 others as heavy snow fell Saturday, authorities said. In California, about 1,200 houses in the adjacent cities of Azusa and Glendora as well as nearby Monrovia were under evacuation orders because of the possibility of destructive flows from the San Gabriel Mountains, a rugged range largely covered by the Angeles National Forest.

'We've got to find a way to get the 100 tons of mud out of my backyard,' Heinlein told the Los Angeles Times. 'We're probably looking at tens of thousands of dollars in damage.' Forecasters predicted only showers in California on Sunday as the storm heads east - a lucky break for the evening's Oscar red carpet festivities in Hollywood. The storm was the much more powerful second act of two systems that hit California during the week. Downtown San Francisco received 8.01 inches of rain by Saturday evening, bringing the city to 44 percent of its normal rainfall but avoiding the city's driest-ever 'rain year' record by roughly half an inch, NWS meteorologist Matt Mehle said. The driest year was in 1851, with just 7.42 inches. The rain year begins July 1. 'All this rain has been really helpful but we are still behind the curve in terms of the drought,' Mehle said. Downtown Los Angeles tallied 4.34 inches from the second storm by 5 p.m. Saturday, said NWS meteorologist Joe Sirard in Oxnard. That raised the rainfall total to 5.54 inches since July 1, still 6.19 inches below normal. In the Hollywood hills, a mudslide took down a tree which knocked down a power pole, leaving homes in the neighborhood in the dark late Saturday.

Other trouble spots included about 13 homes that were evacuated Friday night in the Lake Hughes area in northern Los Angeles County after a mudslide closed a major road. To the east in San Bernardino County, a levee failed and put eight houses in danger of serious flooding, but county fire crews were working to protect them and no evacuations were ordered. The storm also created problems from the sea. Heavy surf in the Long Beach area caused mild to moderate damage to 20 homes on Ocean Boulevard, though no evacuations were required, the fire department said. In Santa Barbara County, strong waves sent water crashing into a beachside restaurant in Goleta and three boats onto the sand and a pier, county fire Capt. Martin Johnson said. The restaurant's manager told KEYT-TV that one of his employees was swept out into the ocean and underneath the pier, where he was able to get out of the water.

Also, a stretch of the oceanfront drive in Santa Cruz was shut down Saturday after a large sinkhole appeared in a cliff, opening the roof of a cave where homeless people have lived. Authorities said public works was investigating. The storm was so volatile that a tornado warning was issued early Saturday for suburbs east of Los Angeles. Numerous traffic accidents occurred on slick or flooded roads across California, including one about 60 miles east of Los Angeles involving a big rig whose driver died after falling from a freeway overpass. The Fresno County sheriff's office also reported a man was injured by lightning Friday. Utilities repaired numerous scattered power outages.

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . Newcastle United’s signing of Remy Cabella was confirmed during Sunday’s World Cup final. His £12m arrival from Montpellier slipped under the radar somewhat given the timing. But worry not, Sportsmail is here to tell you everything you need to know about the highly-rated newcomer to the Premier League… . New boy: Remy Cabella poses with his Newcastle shirt inside St James' Park after sealing his £12million move . In a nutshell, who is he? In short, he’s a 24-year-old French international who plays as an attacking midfielder. He came through the ranks at Montpellier and left having scored 28 times from 115 outings. France international? Sounds like a bit of coup for the Magpies? It certainly is and it’s surprising there wasn’t more of a scramble for his signature. He was included in the France World Cup squad as a late replacement for the injured Clement Grenier and we suspect Newcastle were praying he didn’t get on, for he might just have alerted others to his talents. Thankfully for Alan Pardew – who had been tracking the schemer for some time - Cabella remained on the bench in Brazil and France eventually exited at the quarter-final stage against Germany. Big stage: Cabella (right) was part of France's World Cup squad but failed to make an appearance for Les Bleus . So he isn’t established in the France squad yet? He made his debut in a World Cup warm-up fixture against Norway as a second-half replacement for former Newcastle midfielder Yohan Cabaye – who persuaded him to move to St James’ Park - but he missed out on the initial squad for Brazil. He still just has the one cap to his name but time is on his side and he will be more involved when France begin preparations for the European Championships in September. Don’t forget, 26-year-old Adam Lallana wasn’t an established England international until earlier this year and he’s just joined Liverpool for £25m. You mention Lallana, is he similar in style? Well, they’re about the same size (Cabella is 5ft7in, Lallana 5ft 8in), both boast no shortage of skill and operate in the same areas. Only one cost more than twice as much as the other. Fresh start: Cabella (left), pictured in action against Bastia last season, is Newcastle's fourth summer signing . But I hear he models his game on Cristiano Ronaldo? True, his idol is the Real Madrid and Portugal forward. He even styles his hair in a similar fashion. And Cabella himself told nufcTV: 'I loved to learn how to dribble like him and do the tricks, but now I am on the professional stage, I have my own way. 'I am looking to improve all the time and Newcastle is a well-known, very good club. I just love to improve and that's what I'm here to do.' The Toon Army will be hoping the comparisons with Ronaldo extend beyond his haircut. Break: Cabella will go on holiday to Corsica before returning to pre-season training with his new club . VIDEO Newcastle splash out on Cabella . So what is his game all about? Like a younger Ronaldo, Cabella has, at times, been criticised for too many step-overs, flicks and tricks. Last season, however, he honed his abilities and the upshot was a 14-goal return in Ligue 1, no mean feat for a midfielder. He can create as well as score and there have been comparisons drawn with former Magpie favourite David Ginola. He has a turn of foot to compliment his craft and was Montpellier’s star player last season. Excited: Cabella says he is hoping to become 'one of the best' at Newcastle after leaving Montpellier . Sounds exciting? He is and that’s exactly the word which has been used to describe him. French journalist Julien Laurens told the Chronicle: ‘The most common thing that is said about him is that he’s very much like Ginola. This is because it’s true and because he gets the fans excited. ‘He is very similar to what Ginola was when he was 24. He is a wonderful player and he is someone that the supporters will certainly enjoy watching.’ So where will he fit into Newcastle’s side? With French compatriot Hatem Ben Arfa currently out of favour on Tyneside, Cabella could well operate in the attacking domain he once populated. Ben Arfa was used in an advanced role on either flank or, on occasion, through the middle, and that is where Pardew is likely to deploy his new signing. Sounds too good to be true, so when will he be following Cabaye to PSG?! Let him get his debut out of the way first… .","Cabella signed for a fee in region of £12m from Montpellier .

"By . Natalie Clarke . The Vizconde von Hoehen de Bessarabia once enjoyed the hospitality of the finest hotels in  the world. Among his favourites was the SLS boutique hotel in Beverly Hills. On his blog, The Viscount’s Table, he advised readers: ‘Always insist on Ace of Spades champagne. Two bottles by the rooftop pool at the SLS in Beverly Hills is highly recommended for good living.’ The Vizconde also enjoyed some agreeable stays at the Roxburghe Crowne Plaza and Sheraton Hotel in Edinburgh, where he noted that staff ‘served the most beautiful spring tea to the Viscountess and I in the room’. Kirk Brown aka Vizconde von Hoehen de Bessarabia, lived a life of luxury at the expense of his in-laws after convincing them he was a Moldovan Viscount deprived of his birthright . Indeed, wherever he went, von Hoehen was treated with the reverence due a member of an obscure but noble family in Moldova in Eastern Europe. He was, to borrow a description of him by his admiring father-in-law, a ‘most noble fellow’. Except he wasn’t a nobleman at all, but a conman previously known rather less exotically as Kirk Brown. He persuaded his mother-in-law and his wife’s uncle to invest hundreds of thousands of pounds in a number of phoney business ventures. In a blog post the Viscount claimed that Ace of Spades champagne, which sells for £300 a bottle, was his favourite . Their money was placed in an offshore account called Bessarabia Sovereign Holdings. Von Hoehen’s breaks at luxury hotels in the UK, America and Europe — and his favourite Ace of Spades champagne, which retails at £299.95 a bottle — were paid for with this money. This month, 46-year-old Brown began a 40-month jail sentence for his fraud. His crimes have been uncovered but one mystery remains: how on earth did he get away with it? Let us consider for a moment what image is conjured up when one thinks of a Moldovan viscount. A tall, dashing figure with a dangerous glint in his eye and an air of the rake about him? Yet in the dock at Blackfriars Crown Court stood an overweight, balding bloke with a goatee beard and a tie as dodgy as his title. Presumably he must have been a very convincing storyteller. The Vizconde’s tale was that he was a member of a Moldovan dynasty whose lands in Bessarabia along the Black Sea coast had been confiscated during the communist era. The family had fled to Canada and, when he was old enough, he claimed he left home and moved to Spain, where he studied at the Instituto De La Empresa Barcelona. From there, he travelled to London. At some point, he changed his name by deed poll, using the Spanish Vizconde instead of Viscount as a nod to his sojourn in Spain. No one seemed to consider how odd it was for a Moldovan nobleman to have a Spanish title, a German name and speak with a Canadian accent. In London, the Vizconde met his wife-to-be, a pretty Australian-born blonde called Jodi Young, then 27 and working as a personal assistant. Deprived of his birthright, the Vizconde had to settle on marrying his bride at Lambeth register office and moving into a flat in Streathham, South London, and later to another flat in Peckham, an equally incongruous location for a Moldovan nobleman. In 2009, the couple moved to Shoreditch. On his marriage certificate, the Vizconde was named as one Perran Kasp. He gave his occupation as restaurant consultant (he was later to tell friends he had once been a Michelin-starred chef). His father was named on the document as Neil Brown, a chief executive officer. How he managed to explain to his university-educated wife that his late father was not also a Kasp or a von Hoehen, or whatever, is a mystery. Brown recommended ordering a bottle or two of the bubbly while on the terrace of the SLS hotel in Beverly Hills (pictured) The Vizconde told Jodi that the von Hoehens had managed to keep much of their fortune out of the communists’ hands — and one day, he promised, it would all be theirs. For the first few years of the marriage, it is not clear what the Vizconde did for work. Perhaps he did nothing. After all, that is the prerogative of the highly born, is it not? Presumably, the Viscountess had to go out to work. Jodi’s family were rather in awe of the nobleman their daughter had married. In a note to him written in January 2010, his father-in-law, Bruce Young, began with the words: ‘Most noble fellow, Perran.’ It was around this time that the Vizconde told his wife’s family that a £400  million inheritance would be coming his way soon. In anticipation of this happy event, the Vizconde instructed Phil Spencer, the property expert on Channel 4’s programme Location, Location, Location and Kirstie Allsopp’s sidekick, to find him a nice London house. ‘I wasted a lot of time on him,’ recalls Mr Spencer. ‘We went to view a £14 million house in Russell Square and he was talking about where the servants would live and where the Bentley would go. 'There were lots of discussions, but it came to nothing. I refused to put an offer in on the property until I was reassured all the finances were in place, but that didn’t happen. ‘He was very plausible — a very pleasant man — and a terrible name dropper. He said he knew Tom Cruise and Barack Obama . . . The Vizconde also boasted to friends of his plans to buy a private jet to make travelling less onerous. Brown even went so far as to contact TV estate agent Phil Spencer to buy a £14million house in Russel Square which he claimed could be bought with a £400million inheritance windfall . Then he began discussing a number of business ventures with his in-laws. He spoke to his wife’s uncle, Richard Birch, a high-profile Australian who helped coordinate the opening ceremonies for the Beijing and Sydney Olympics. The Vizconde offered to invest some of the money from his ‘inheritance’ in a new company to be set up between himself and Mr Birch. First, though, he asked for £50,000 from Mr Birch to give him preference shares in the company. The Vizconde also told Mr Birch he had control of a shipping container company based in the Seychelles and asked him for £56,000 to buy new containers. Then he asked Mr Birch to hand over a further £10,000 to be used in a venture with a fictitious Bulgarian stockbroker. The Vizconde also persuaded his wife’s mother, Nicki Young, to part with £150,000 to invest in the same shipping container business. As we know, much of this money funded the Vizconde’s holidays and meals at expensive restaurants. As well as fine dining, von Hoehen said he also had ambitions to become a novelist, and needed cash to set up a company to publish a book. In June 2010, Black Mary Press Ltd was born and in 2011 his debut novel, The Black Sea, came out under the name VP von Hoehen. In an interview on a book review blog, he said the inspiration for The Black Sea was ‘based on my own family’s struggle to get back what was rightfully ours prior to the communist takeover of Moldova’. But by now this elaborate web of deceit was beginning to unravel. Mr Birch and Mrs Young, concerned that the schemes they had invested in were not making any returns, had begun asking questions. Despite their expensive lifestyle Brown and his wife Jodi Young lived in a flat in Peckham before moving to Shoreditch (file picture) To allay their fears, von Hoehen sent them faked bank statements. He then told Mr Birch that one of his employees had emptied the contents of his bank account and donated them to the Taliban. This was an absurdity too far. It is believed that at this point Mr Birch alerted the police. Von Hoehen was arrested. After the arrest, he moved to a flat in Farnham, Surrey. In the past month or so he has been seen out and about in the town sporting a floppy leather hat with a feather in it. On his arm at a local restaurant recently was a woman with dark hair with purple streaks in it. She told staff it was ‘one of her first dates’ with him. Unsurprisingly, it seems the Vizconde’s marriage to Jodie, the ‘Viscountess’ has collapsed and this week she could not be traced. Last month, von Hoehen’s case was heard at Highbury Magistrates Court and moved to Blackfriars Crown Court for sentencing. The court heard that his  mother-in-law, Nicki Young, a 68-year-old grandmother who lives in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, has been forced to return to work as a primary school supply teacher to pay off her debts. Giving evidence, she said: ‘I treated him as a son. It was not just that he was a friend to me, he was family, and that’s why I didn’t question his investing my money for me. ‘I probably came close to a nervous breakdown. I was very foolish and trusting. These were my life savings. He seemed very calm and said, “I’m sorry, I’m a congenital liar, it’s like a gambling addiction.”’ Von Hoehen, wearing black jeans and a tatty black coat, pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud by false representation. He listened intently to the proceedings, but remained impassive throughout. Just a few days earlier, he had eaten out at a restaurant in Farnham. Instead of his ‘Vizconde’ title, he made the reservation under the name of Brown — the game, he knew, was up.","Kirk Brown, 46, has started a 40 month jail sentence for fraud .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Quadruple amputee Philippe Croizon has successfully swam from Alaska to Russia, braving freezing waters and relying on paddle-like prosthetics to cut through the currents of the Bering Strait. The Frenchman, whose limbs were amputated after he suffered a freak 20,000 volt accident in 1994, has now completed his quest to cross the waterways connecting the continents of Oceania, Asia, Europe, Africa, and America in his  Intercontinental Straits Swimming Challenge. Croizon donned multiple body suits on Saturday to combat the icy waters, about . 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius), along with wild waters, with swells . of 6 to 8 feet (1.8-2.4 m). Heavy fog made navigating difficult as well. Scroll down for video . La Victoire: Quadruple amputee Philippe Croizon (right) celebrated alongside his swimming partner Arnaud Chassery, their successful swim from Alaska to Russia . The journey, from Alaska's Little Diomede Island to the Russian maritime border near Big Diomede Island, measured about 2.5 miles (4 km) and took the swimmer about an hour and 15 minutes to complete. ‘Philippe said it was the hardest thing . he ever did, even harder than crossing the English Channel,’ Marc . Gaviard, coordinator for the expedition, told Reuters. When he had . finished, ‘He was totally out of energy.’ Long distance swimmer, Arnaud Chassery, accompanied Croizon for the swim. The 44-year-old Croizon is the second person to swim the Bering Strait from Alaska to Russia. American long-distance swimmer Lynne Cox was the first to swim the route in 1987. From America to Asia: The journey from Alaska's Little Diomede Island to the Russian maritime border near Big Diomede Island, measured about two miles and took the swimmer about an hour and 15 minutes . Croizon took on the swimming challenge to raise awareness of the abilities of handicapped people. In May, the father-of-two completed . the first part of the challenge swimming from Australia to Asia in a 12 . mi (20 km) journey from Papua New Guinea to Indonesia in . seven-and-a-half hours. Then . a month later, he crossed the Red Sea from Egypt to Jordan, for the . Asia to Africa portion, over a distance of 12 mi (19 km) in about 5 . hours.

"By . Joel Christie . Her name, Pu'iwa, means surprise in Hawaiian. And this 15-year-old female chimpanzee managed to do exactly that to zookeepers in Honolulu this week. Pu'iwa (pronounced pooh-eeva) escaped his enclosure at Honolulu Zoo in Waikiki, moving a barrel into position and using it to scale a wall. Measuring about 4 feet tall, the determined little creature somehow got over the 15 foot fence. 'She's out!': Pu'iwa, the youngest of the chimpanzees at Honolulu Zoo in Waikiki, managed to escape her enclosure on Tuesday . The escape prompted a code red emergency to be announced, with visitors ushered into one area as a precaution . Zookeepers say Pu'iwa used a barrel to scale the 15 foot wall of the enclosure . A visitor saw the escape and alerted staff. The zoo issued a code red and visitors were ushered into one area as a precaution. A worker found Pu'iwa sitting on a high wall and shot her with a tranquilizer dart. 'Chimpanzees are not only incredibly athletic but very, very clever,' zoo director Jim Wilkinson told Hawaii News Now. 'Zoos all over the world are always trying to evolve and create better exhibits that really minimize the risk of escape.' Wilkinson said that was no serious sense of danger, but that they still took serious precaution. 'Anytime you have an incident with the escape of any animal there is a certain element of risk,' he said. Director of Honolulu Zoo, Jim Wilkinson, tells media how the zoo handled the escape . The zoo, which sits across from Waikiki beach, issued a code red emergency after a visitor noticed the chimp get out of her enclosure . Pu'iwa was out of her enclosure for about one hour . Public safety is our number one priority here so we want to make absolutely sure that this isn't going to happen again. Pu'iwa has since recovered from the sedation. She is the youngest of the chimpanzees at the zoo was born at the enclosure. In 1997, two years before Pu'iwa was born, chimps escaped from the same exhibit by climbing overhanging trees.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Updated: . 19:42 EST, 10 December 2011 . Britain has spent more than £100 million in the past year on consultants to combat cyber espionage and the growing use of the internet by terrorists. Now, MPs are investigating the soaring costs of employing private contractors, some paid the equivalent of £150,000 a year, three times the average wage at GCHQ, the Government’s signal and intelligence agency. The specialists are mostly IT experts recruited to ensure the security agencies have state-of-the-art systems to run complex surveillance operations, thwart cyber attacks and provide digital back-up. Soaring costs: MPs on the Intelligence and Security Committee are have appointed an independent investigator to review bills being paid by MI5, MI6 (pictured) and GCHQ . But MPs on the Intelligence and Security Committee are so concerned about the size of the consultancy fees, they have appointed an independent investigator to review bills being paid by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. Last year, MI5 spent £56.8 million on consultants, 73 per cent up on the previous year. This year, the bill is predicted to rise by 52 per cent to more than £80 million. And GCHQ last year spent £43 million on 297 part-time contractors at its Cheltenham headquarters. Under last year’s spending review, all three agencies are facing an 11 per cent cut. But the cutbacks have left gaps which are being plugged by outside contractors. The huge fees paid are understood to have angered serving staff, some of whom are on salaries of less than £25,000. Earlier this year, GCHQ directors complained they couldn’t keep staff because  of poaching by Google and Microsoft which could afford to offer generous pay deals. Whitehall sources argue that private consultant costs are high because of ‘public sector pay constraints’. A GCHQ spokesman said: ‘GCHQ takes controlling the cost of consultants very seriously.’","Last year, MI5 spent £56.8 million on consultants - 73 per cent up on previous year .

"By . Tim Shipman In Lashkar Gah . David Cameron had admitted that Britain will have to continue to support the Afghan army 'long after 2014', when UK forces are officially due to withdraw. Speaking at a press conference in the presidential palace, where Taliban forces attacked last week, the Prime Minister admitted that Britain has paid 'a high price' after 12 years of war. He said: 'While our combat troops will return home, we have already committed to support and sustain the Afghan security forces with financial support long after 2014.' Mr Cameron said Britain 'has not made any commitments' beyond the military academy but he did not rule out doing more and explicitly said Nato may well need to do more 'to assist Afghan forces'. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron made an unannounced visit to Afghanistan today to frontline troops in Helmand province as a senior military official admitted that British soldiers will need to stay in the country beyond the end of 2014 . Cameron was greeted at Camp Bastion in the southern Helmand province during a visit to mark Armed Forces day . He added: 'I want to pay particular tribute to the 444 British men and women who have died serving our country here. 'I think of their families and . friends. We have paid a high price but since British troops arrived here . over a decade we have dramatically reduced the terror threat emanating . from this region. 'We came here to make Afghanistan safer. To make Britain safer. And together we are achieving that.' Earlier a senior military figure suggested that British troops will be in Afghanistan until the end of the decade. Despite the start of . political reconciliation, a senior commander has conceded that British . troops will have to stay for 'three to five years' after the UK ends . combat operations in December 2014. That means British forces could still be in the war zone in December 2019. Mr Cameron visited the frontline to mark Armed Forces Day and announce plans for a permanent Afghan war memorial in the UK. Mr Cameron later flew on to Islamabad, where he will hold talks with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. Today, a senior diplomat revealed that troops will have to work alongside their Taliban enemies. Prisoners from the militant group will be released as part of peace negotiations and senior sources say they will be 'put in uniform' in the Afghan military. That will dismay the families of the 444 British servicemen who have died in Afghanistan since 2001. Mr Cameron was shown a remote-controlled surveillance aircraft during his Camp Bastion visit today . Cameron was shown a map of the area by Major Jim Skelton during his Armed Forces day visit to Camp Bastion . It had already been announced that . 170 British troops will remain after the end of 2014 to run the Afghan . officer academy at Qarga, known as 'Sandhurst in the sand'. But senior commanders have now admitted that Afghan forces will need far more help than just training. Nato's . follow-on mission will also have to help with medical evacuation, . logistics, planning helicopter operations and integrating ground combat . with close air support. Army . chiefs say the Afghan military are now a match for the Taliban on the . battlefield, but lack the ability to run support operations properly. An Afghan operation in Sangin was abandoned recently because the brigade ran out of fuel. It is also likely that some British special forces will remain to conduct counter terrorist operations. The UK currently has 7,900 troops in Afghanistan and will fall to 5,200 by the end of 2013. The number of bases will fall from 11 to four or five by the end of the year. Mr Cameron's trip was designed to hail progress over the last 13 years. But . a senior diplomat admitted that political gains - including six million . children now attending school - are 'not irreversible', though . politicians hope that the younger generation of Afghans will resist a . slide back to the old warlord culture. Soldiers showed Mr Cameron a remote-controlled IED detection unit used in regional operations during his visit to the base . British forces could still be in the war zone in December 2019 as they are needed to help with medical evacuation, logistics, planning helicopter operations and in integrating ground combat with close air support (file photo) Diplomats also admit that the Taliban are likely to win greater power after 2014. Talks are under way to change the Afghan constitution, which gives 'godlike' powers to the President. Changes would make it easier for the Taliban to control the Southern and Eastern parts of the country. Mr Cameron met troops at Camp Bastion in Helmand province before travelling to Lashkar Gah and a forward operating base. He . announced £3.8million of funding for military charities, including . £300,000 to fund a permanent Afghan war memorial at the Armed Forces . Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Another £2.5million has been awarded to programmes supporting treatment and awareness of mental health issues for veterans. The . plan will see an impromptu memorial built by troops at Camp Bastion . flown home and incorporated into a permanent roll call of the dead back . home. The new memorial will be erected in . sand coloured stone over the next 18 months and dedicated once combat . operations in Afghanistan have ended. The money will come from banks fined over the Libor scandal. The . Prime Minister said: 'Britain must never forget those who gave their . lives in Afghanistan. A Bastion Memorial Wall back at home deserves . every penny of this funding. 'It . will give us a permanent place to remember those who made the ultimate . sacrifice in Afghanistan and to show how proud and thankful we are for . all they gave serving our country. 'They must never be forgotten.' Today, a senior diplomat revealed that troops will have to work alongside their Taliban prisoners who will be released as part of peace negotiations and 'put in uniform' in the Afghan military (file photo) The trip came as General Nick Carter, the commander of British troops in Afghanistan, said opportunities were missed in 2002 to talk peace with the Taliban. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, he said: 'Back in 2002, the Taliban were on the run. 'I think that at that stage, if we had been very prescient, we might have spotted that a final political solution to what started in 2001, from our perspective, would have involved getting all Afghans to sit at the table and talk about their future.' Mr Cameron agreed that talks with the Taliban could have begun earlier. He said: 'I think you can argue about whether the settlement we put in place after 2001 could have been better arranged. 'Of course you can make that argument. Since I became Prime Minister in 2010 I have been pushing all the time . for a political process and that political process is now under way. 'But . at the same time I know that you cannot bank on that which is why we . have built up the Afghan army, built up the Afghan police, supported the . Afghan government so after our troops have left, and they will be . leaving under the programme we have set out, this country shouldn't be a . haven for terrorists.' Troops could stay three to five years longer than previously announced, the official said (file photo) A senior No10 source said the National Security Council would have to decide whether British troops would play a wider role after 2015. The source said: 'The PM has been clear that we have paid a heavy price and already given a lot. 'Our combat troops will leave at the end of next year. The only military commitments we have made beyond 2014 are to part run the Officer Academy and to provide financial support to sustain Afghan forces. 'We have not been asked to do anything more. The PM view is that we have done our fair share and it will now be for other International Security Assistance Force partners to carry the main burden.'","Senior official says soldiers will be needed for extra three to five years .

"Erin DiMeglio, 17, made history as Florida's first female high school quarterback . By . Sadie Whitelocks . and Leslie Larson . A teenager who made history as Florida's first female, high school quarterback has been crowned Homecoming Queen. Erin DiMeglio, 17, received the honour last night at the Paladin Stadium in South Plantation, as her soccer team, the Paladins, secured a 18-0 victory over the Hollywood Hills. Instead of a dress, the sports enthusiast opted to wear her number 20 football kit for the halftime ceremony. Scroll down for video . What a sport! She made history as Florida' s first female high school quarterback, and last night Erin DiMeglio was crowned Homecoming Queen . Talking about the accolade, Miss DiMeglio told the Sun Sentinel: 'It's really cool to be noticed as the homecoming queen and be a . football player. I never thought I was going to win. This is crazy.' Her Paladins teammate, wide receiver Hordley Seide, was announced as Homecoming King. After accepting a sash and tiara Miss DiMeglio added: 'To be with my teammate, I don't think it's ever . happened before, a guy and a girl from the football team being king.' The teen is a backup quarterback for the South Plantation High . School Paladins, in Sunrise, Florida, near Fort Lauderdale. All-rounder: Miss DiMeglio said that it's 'cool to be noticed as the homecoming queen and be a football player' She has been practicing with the team since May and was able to hold her own during the fourth quarter of the Paladins game on August 24, calling plays and completing two passes. 'I couldn't take the smile off my face,' she previously  told the Sun Sentinel about her field play. 'The other players have been great. After the game, they shook my hand and said it was great I was playing football.' A basketball star in her own right, Miss DiMeglio was actually recruited to play flag football but as she trained, her natural talent for the sport became evident. Paladins football coach, Douglas Gatewood, observed her moves and invited her to train with the varsity team - and a star was born. Special occasion: Miss DiMeglio swapped her sports helmet for a tiara . Double act: Miss DiMeglio's Paladins teammate, Hordley Seide, was announced as Homecoming King . Football in Florida is like a religion. The Sunshine State has been a breeding ground for NFL greats like Emmitt Smith, Deion Sanders and current up-and-comer Jets QB Tim Tebow. The state is joined by Texas and California in producing the most NFL players. Though high school football has seen . female participation in the past, most have been in spots like kickers, . receivers, defensive backs and offensive linemen (or linewomen). Rarely has a woman ascended to the high profile position of quarterback on the team. Logistically speaking, Miss DiMeglio joins the team in pretty much everything - except the locker room. You go girl: Erin Dimeglio was recruited for the flag football team, when her natural talent was spotted and she began to train with the school's varsity football team in May . No special treatment: DiMeglio's coach and fellow team members praise her talent and sportsmanship, insisting that she has to hold her own . She changes into her uniform in the empty girls locker room, on the other side of her school. 'She doesn't ask for any special treatment,' Coach Gatewood said about his no-nonsense approach to incorporating DiMeglio. 'She's not trying to show anybody up, she really just trying to do her thing and if a boy takes it the wrong way, that's on him, not on her.' 'She's got to walk in the middle of . [the football huddle] and tell them what to do and when to do it and . they better listen to her ... and they do,' the coach added. State . records show a total of 523 female Floridians have taken to the field . in high school football since 1973. In 2011, a total of 36 girls played . for teams across the state. Miss DiMeglio said her older sister, Amy, thinks she is crazy, but 'I just think this is so much fun,' she said. Off the field: Erin Dimeglio (left) says her older sister Amy (right) thinks she is crazy for playing with the boys . 'I've played flag football since the fourth grade. Scoring on boys is really fun, just to see their reactions, see the coaches get mad. I'll be nervous, yeah. But this is like any other game. You just have to get in the zone and play.' Despite Erin's enthusiasm, her parents are carefully monitoring their daughter in the contact sport known for harrowing injuries. As a veteran athlete, the high schooler has had her fair share of injuries from her tenure on the basketball team, including a broken nose, a broken finger and multiple concussions. 'I've often joked that I wanted her to play basketball with a helmet on,' Kathleen DiMeglio, Erin's mother, said. 'She's no weakling and I think I have confidence after seeing her strength. But of course my greatest fear is injury,' the concerned mom added.","Erin DiMeglio, 17, made history as Florida's first female high school quarterback ."
"By . Larisa Brown . An avid Cabbage Patch Kids fan has dedicated three rooms of his flat to his collection of more than 600 dolls that he says are his children. Bachelor Dan Knowlton, 41, has spent thousands of pounds buying the soft cloth dolls and has even visited their 'birthplace', where he adopted his favourite doll after Mother Cabbage went into 'labour'. He spends several hours a week caring for the cuddly toys - changing their outfits and dusting the beds, chairs and shelves where they sit. Dan Knowlton, 41, has dedicated three rooms of his flat to his collection of more than 600 Cabbage Patch Kids dolls . He has spent thousands of pounds buying the soft cloth dolls which became popular in the 1980s . Mr Knowlton stopped counting how many Cabbage Patch Kids he owned when he reached the 600 mark around five years ago. He first bought into the American craze in 1983, aged 12, after seeing photos of the original all-cloth dolls in a newspaper. The brand became a massive phenomenon in the 1980s . - inspiring magazines, films, stamps and boardgames - and its dolls . have become collectors' items. Each comes with its own birth certificate. Mr Knowlton, who works as a freelance . catering manager, said: 'I loved the Cabbage Patch Kids straight away . because they were something a bit different. 'I had to wait until they produced the hard-headed models in this country though before I could have one of my own. 'When they came on the market I . scrimped and saved my pocket money and savings to buy my first doll, . Justin David, for about 25 pounds. The freelance catering manager dedicates several hours a week to caring for the cuddly toys . 'It spiralled from there - they now take up most of my home and I couldn't say how much I have spent buying them. I love their individuality. As the all cloth dolls have been hand stitched each one is different.' The plastic headed dolls were created by Xavier Roberts and mass-produced in the early 1980s. Mr Knowlton, who is single, owns 205 of the soft-faced dolls, which can fit into real baby clothes. He dresses them in his four nieces' old babygrows and his mum, Margaret Cullen, buys the dolls outfits when . she spots them in charity shops. There are so many that the dolls, who . are spread through Mr Knowlton's bedroom, lounge and computer room, have . their own wardrobe. He said: 'My Cabbage Patch Kids are my children. They're easier to cope with. They have a few hand-me-down clothes from my nieces, and I've even made a few outfits for them over the years. One of the Cabbage Patch Kids dolls that Mr Knowlton thinks of as one of his children . 'My nieces love coming round to play . with the Kids, although they know not to touch the soft-faced ones, . which are more precious. 'But they like playing with the hard-headed ones - I've let them do it since they were babies. 'Everybody who knows me knows about my Cabbage Patch collection.' Mr Knowlton manages an online group . for collectors, and says the world of Cabbage Patch Kids devotees is a . 'very nice' community. Mr Knowlton, from Locks Heath, near . Southampton, Hants, has twice travelled to BabyLand General, the . hospital where the Cabbage Patch Kids are 'born' in Georgia, US. It's where he adopted his favourite, Robin Linda, and 10 others. His first trip, in 2000, was for a week-long Cabbage Patch Kids collectors' convention. The team of 'doctors and nurses', plus . thousands of newborn Cabbage Patch Kids, had moved to a bigger building . by his second visit. The avid fan from Locks Heath, near Southampton, Hants, has twice travelled to BabyLand General, the hospital where the Cabbage Patch Kids are 'born' in Georgia, US . The babies emerge from underneath the Magical Crystal Tree, following an announcement that Mother Cabbage has gone into labour. Mr Knowlton was given one of the heads . - which cannot be bought in shops - from the original magic tree at the . old hospital as a gift from a friend. Mr Knowlton said: 'Visiting Babyland was brilliant - an absolutely magical experience. You get to walk around the long lines of cribs. 'That's why Robin's my favourite: she was the first one I picked out to adopt. 'The whole process is more special than simply buying them.' The first doll he bought, left, and his favourite doll Robin Linda, right . His oldest doll is Agness, one of the sought after Little People original editions, handmade in 1979. The dolls, which quickly became a fad, changed their name to Cabbage Patch Kids in 1982. Mr Knowlton's dream purchase would be a rare, first edition 'Helen Blue'. They would have been made by Mr Roberts himself, his friends or family from his small initial team. Mr Knowlton said: ;There's something about the old dolls which takes me back to my childhood. 'I'd love to own a Helen Blue but it would set me back around 15,000 dollars. 'I'll have to win the lottery first.'","Dan Knowlton bought his first doll aged 12 after seeing photos in newspaper .

"By . Neil Sears . Updated: . 05:33 EST, 30 December 2011 . Even in the painstaking world of art conservation, there can have been few more delicate tasks. The £160million Virgin And Child With Saint Anne by Leonard da Vinci was in need of a clean-up. But an attempt to restore the 500-year-old Renaissance masterpiece has descended into an unseemly row, with two British art experts accused of being too zealous. Concerns have been expressed that the painting has been overcleaned, leaving it garishly brighter than Leonardo intended. The Virgin And Child With Saint Anne by Leonard da Vinci which two French experts believe is too bright now it has been 'over-cleaned' British conservation experts Luke Syson and Larry Keith were reportedly the most insistent members of the 20-strong international committee which advised the painting’s owners, the Louvre, to carry out the cleaning process. While the programme of restoring The Virgin And Child With Saint Anne is not yet complete, two senior French art historians have already resigned from their positions on the advisory committee. According to reports, they did so to disassociate  themselves from the cleaning techniques being used. Mr Syson, curator of pre-1500  Italian paintings at the National Gallery in London, and Mr Keith, director of  conservation at the National Gallery, were yesterday unavailable for comment. The pair both worked on the British gallery’s current blockbuster Leonardo da Vinci exhibition, which does not feature the Louvre painting. A spokesman for the Louvre has, meanwhile, insisted that the cleaning was one of the best researched ever, and that all had gone well. The Parisian gallery has not commented on the resignation of Ségolène Bergeon Langle and Jean-Pierre Cuzin. Popular: The Louvre in Paris. Two senior French art experts have resigned from their positions at the world's most visited art museum after the restoration of the masterpiece . The two conservation and painting experts have also declined to comment except to confirm their resignations. But a Louvre source said the specialists believed the painting had been overcleaned, and that more tests should have been carried out first. Remaining members of the committee were said to be split between those who fear the painting has been made too bright, and those happy with the work. Mr Syson and Mr Keith are among the members believed to be satisfied with the ongoing restoration. The Louvre source was quoted in the Guardian newspaper as saying: ‘The English were very pushing, saying they know Leonardo is extremely  delicate but “we can move without any danger to the work”. 'There was a row a year ago about solvents because they said they were safe, and Bergeon Langle said they’re not safe.’ Fresh developments may come next Tuesday, when experts are due to view the masterpiece to assess the conservation process. They may decide retouching is needed.","English officials had a row over the table with French experts over the type of cleaning fluids .

"By . Sam Webb . A Government agency is accused of opening flood gates to protect a town's shops and businesses - at the expense of a village full of family homes. The Environment Agency issued an order to open the sluice gates of a dam near Tonbridge, Kent, in order to save the town's post-Christmas sales shopping and industrial units, it has been reported. However, the resulting surge of 1.25m gallons of water into the River Medway led to the deluge of the village of Yalding eight miles away. Workmen clear water from a home in Yalding, Kent, after it was flooded during the recent bad weather. It has been claimed the village was deluged in order to save businesses in nearby Tonbridge . Swamped: The Beult river near Yalding is still swollen with water five days later . One of those affected was Erika Olivares, 49, who met Prime Minister David Cameron when he visited the flood-hit village on Friday. She accused him of failing to deliver on a promise to ensure those living in flood-threatened areas would be able to get affordable insurance cover. Mrs Olivares, who lives in a £275,000 three-bedroom cottage with husband Pablo, told the Sunday Times she was 'furious' with the EA. She added: 'We were told on Christmas Eve that the gates were going to be opened and we were going to be flooded. 'By that time we didn't have a hope in hell of getting prepared. They said they would rather sacrifice 1,000 homes here than risk Tonbridge.' Other villagers said they were given just six minutes warning about the coming flood. However, an Environment Agency spokesperson denied a decision between Tonbridge and Yalding had been made. Some villagers said they were given just six minutes warning about the coming flood . Taking stock: Rob Woolley looks at the damage to his 1971 MG Midget at his home in Yalding, Kent, after it was flooded during the recent bad weather . He added: 'Operating the Leigh Barrier to store 5.5million cubic . metres of water protected Tonbridge without having any adverse impact on other . communities. 'Had the barrier not been in operation Kent communities would have . experienced flooding comparable to the devastation in the county during 1968.' He is referring to the floods which hit large areas of Kent after a deluge of continuous rain. Cars were swept away and people were trapped in their houses. Tonbridge was particularly badly hit. Flooding fears continue to plague Britain as another band of persistent rain and heavy wind heads towards the UK. The latest storm pushing in from the Atlantic will arrive in the west this evening before spreading north-eastwards overnight, causing Monday morning disruption. It will add to the misery of thousands who have been left without power and endured flooded homes over the Christmas period. Sean Matthews clears Christmas decorations and personal belongings from his home in Yalding after it was flooded . Homeowners along the River Medway and Stour are being warned that their properties are at risk of flooding . Some 1,300 properties have been flooded during the recent storms in England, the Environment Agency said, while flood defences have protected more than 80,000 properties. It warned the predicted rainfall meant there is a 'continued heightened flood risk' across southern England, especially south west England where river levels remain high and the ground is already saturated. Large rivers such as the Thames, Severn and Great Ouse in Cambridgeshire are most at risk of flooding, while high water levels on the River Medway and Stour in Kent will cause continued flooding and travel disruption, the EA said. A Downing Street spokesman said ministers held a COBRA meeting yesterday where it was agreed financial assistance will be given to local authorities facing an undue financial burden because of the storms through a process known as the Bellwin scheme. Unrelenting: More heavy downpours and violent winds are due tomorrow, bringing further risk of flooding across southern England .","Agency accused of choosing businesses over homes in Kent .

"By . James Slack . and Jack Doyle . Promise: David Cameron has said he will reduce net migration to 'tens of thousands' A huge majority of voters want David Cameron to defy the EU and maintain controls on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants. In an explosive Daily Mail survey, eight out of ten said they did not want citizens of the two countries to be handed free access to UK jobs from January 1. Ministers warn Britain will be taken to court if it ignores the Brussels edict to let the migrants in. But the threat of big fines from the European Court of Justice was brushed off by almost two thirds of the public. They said that – even if it meant legal sanctions – the Prime Minister should keep the restrictions in place to ‘serve the national interest’. And 80 per cent of voters say Westminster should retain the final say over who enters the country. Only 5 per cent think Brussels should be in charge. An overwhelming 85 per cent said migration was putting too much pressure on schools, hospitals and housing. The findings of the Harris poll, conducted earlier this week, will heap further pressure on Downing Street to stop a potentially major influx from Romania and Bulgaria. Although officials have refused to predict how many will come, the Migrationwatch think-tank puts the figure as high as 70,000 a year. That would almost certainly wreck Mr Cameron’s promise to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. In a devastating blow for the Premier, our poll reveals that only 11 per cent  trust the Tories on immigration – six percentage points less than Labour and 11 less than UKIP. But, in a stark indictment of the whole political class, a disturbing 44 per cent have no trust in any party on this most serious of issues. The Prime Minister has repeatedly pointed to the fact that net migration – the difference between the number of people arriving in the UK, and those leaving – is down by a third, to 176,000, since 2010. But, in the Mail’s survey, 80 per cent said this figure was still too many. The findings are scathing about Labour’s record in office. Two thirds of the public agreed with former Labour home secretary Jack Straw’s statement that throwing open the doors to Poles and other East Europeans in May 2004 had been a ‘spectacular mistake’. An astonishing 79 per cent of the voters said they had not been properly consulted over the open door immigration policies pursued by the last government, which added 2.5million to the UK’s population. Asked if the impact of mass immigration had been good for British society as a whole, only 19 per cent said yes, while 64 per cent said no. Four in ten said immigration had changed their community for the worse, compared with only 11 per cent who said it was better. Seventy-six per cent say it has affected the ability of young Britons to get a job. Yet, in results which will alarm Tory strategists, Ed Miliband’s party scores better than Mr Cameron’s on immigration policy. Support: Respondents agreed with former Home Secretary Jack Straw, who said opening the borders would be a 'mistake' while Immigration Minister Mark Harper said there would not be an influx in January . Asked . who they trust most, 22 per cent of voters picked UKIP, 17 per cent . Labour, 11 per cent the Tories, and 4 per cent the Lib Dems. The poll . shows older people are particularly concerned about net migration: 72 . per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds said it was too high compared with more . than 90 per cent of those aged over 55. An extraordinary 95 per cent of those in this older age group were in favour of continuing restrictions after January 1. Mr Cameron will now find himself under intense pressure from worried Tory MPs to act over Romania and Bulgaria. The two countries joined the EU in 2007, but were subject to so-called transitional controls. This meant only the self-employed and those given permits to carry out low-skilled agricultural work, such as fruit picking, could join the UK jobs market. Ministers have kept the transitional controls in place for the maximum period. But, under EU rules, the arrangements must be lifted on January 1. Any failure to do so would be considered a breach of the free movement directive – a founding principle of the EU. Britain would most likely face heavy . fines, but the European Court of Justice – the EU’s enforcement arm – is . notoriously slow moving. Sovereignty: Only 5% of the people surveyed said they though Brussels should have control over policy . Tory MPs believe the 2015 general election may even have passed before a verdict is handed down. Mr Cameron’s main problem with defying Brussels is that he would face ferocious protests from his Liberal Democrat partners. He . would also face objections from the Foreign Office which wants the UK . to honour its international treaty obligations. On Wednesday, . immigration minister Mark Harper insisted Britain will not face a flood . of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria when controls lapse in the New . Year. But he insisted he was ‘not complacent’ about potential problems . and pointed to measures to limit access to social housing and benefits. He rejected comparisons between next year’s changes and 2004 – when Labour opened up the borders to eight Eastern European countries – including Poland. Then, officials predicted just 13,000 migrants a year would come but more than a million have arrived. Mr Harper said there was a ‘big difference’ between then and now because migrants will be lured to Germany by the jobs there and to other countries with larger Romanian and Bulgarian populations. Camps: UK Border Agency staff and police round up Romanians living in Hendon earlier this year. The migrants will be allowed more access to UK jobs and welfare from January 1 . Concerns over the likely scale of immigration from the two countries – whose combined population is 29million – this week prompted Tory backbenchers to demand the controls be extended. Nigel Mills, the MP for Amber Valley, proposed extending them until the end of 2018. But Mr Harper said this would be a breach of EU treaties signed by the last Labour government – and would lead to court action. He said: ‘It simply isn’t legally possible. The accession treaties only give us the ability – and the other eight counties with transitional controls – to extend them to the end of the year. ‘The only way you could legally extend them is if you amended the accession treaties, which you would have to do by unanimity including getting the agreement of Romania and Bulgaria and I don’t think that is at all possible.’ This week it was revealed that colleges have been hit with a surge in applications from Romanians and Bulgarians wanting taxpayer-funded loans and grants to study in this country. A total of 5,000 individuals – or one in six of all applicants to vocational courses in England – were from the two countries. Many will be entitled to up to £10,000 in taxpayer-funded grants and loans. Fears of fraud prompted ministers to put all applications from the EU on hold. Last night, a Number 10 spokesman said: ‘For more than a decade Labour failed to control immigration and allowed the number of migrants coming to Britain to soar to record highs. ‘This Government has taken decisive steps to clear up Labour’s mess. We have cut net migration by a third in just over three years, closed dozens of bogus colleges and imposed a cap on migrant workers from outside the EU.’ Click here for the full statistics.","82% of respondents said no to a new influx from Bulgaria and Romania .

But Ms Ramsey travels the globe swimming with many species of sharks hoping to prove they are nothing like their Jaws film reputation.

"By . Ted Thornhill . For most people, most of the time, Facebook is a bright and breezy place where they share holiday and baby photos and brag about great parties they’ve been to. But the social media site has a darker side, because a new study reveals that status updates can reveal a range of personality traits, including if someone has psychopathic tendencies. Researchers from Sahlgrenska Academy and Lund University in Sweden found that status updates that indicated psychopathy could concern prostitutes, decapitation, pornography and butchers. The dark side of Facebook: Status updates can reveal psychopathic traits, say Swedish researchers (stock image) Some employers and pyschologists say it is. The German magazine Der Tagesspiegel . went so far as to point out that accused theater shooter James Holmes . and Norwegian mass murder Anders Behring Breivik have common ground in . their lack of Facebook profiles. On a more tangible level, Forbes.com . reports that human resources departments across the country are . becoming more wary of young job candidates who don't use the site. The common concern among bosses is that a . lack of Facebook could mean the applicant's account could be so full of . red flags that it had to be deleted. Psychologist Christopher Moeller told Der Tagesspiegel magazine that using Facebook has become a sign of having a healthy social network. Psychologists have noted that Holmes, along with several noted mass murderers, have lacked any real friends. And . this is what the argument boils down to: It's the suspicion that not . being on Facebook, which has become so normal among young adults, is a . sign that you're abnormal and dysfunctional, or even dangerous, ways. People with psychopathic traits are strongly focused on their own . wishes, and have a lack of empathy for others. These people often break . norms and rules, and have a higher inclination to commit crime, the researchers said. Those with narcissistic personality traits could emphasise their own good characteristics by, for example, noting that others did not understand what true happiness is, the study found. People with narcissistic traits are self-absorbed, self-glorifying and have an exaggerated confidence in their own abilities. Neurotic personality traits can also be discerned from the analysis of the status updates and are also discerned by how many friends you have on Facebook and how often you update your status . The study also shows that Facebook users with extrovert and open personalities generally have many friends on Facebook and update their status more often than others. People with Machiavellian traits, meanwhile, are cynical, emotionally distant and unaffected by morals. They deceive and manipulate people in their surroundings to gain advantages. The research was based on personality tests and content analyses in status updates on Facebook for just over 300 Americans and is the first of its kind. ‘Facebook has revolutionised how people interact on the Internet, and this offers a unique opportunity for psychological research,’ said Danilo Garcia, researcher at Sahlgrenska Academy's research centre, the Centre for Ethics, Law and Mental Health. Revealing: Facebook offers a unique opportunity for psychological research, say experts (stock image) The Facebook users answered a scientific questionnaire with questions that test extrovert, neurotic, psychopathic, narcissistic and Machiavellian personality traits. They also sent in their 15 most recent status updates. The contents of the status updates were then studied with algorithms for latent semantic analysis, which is a method for measuring the significance of words. For those people who've read status updates from friends that seem bizarre, Lund University psychologist Sverker Sikström, who was involved in the study, has some words of comfort. He told The Local: 'Even if you show psychopathic personality traits on Facebook, that doesn't automatically mean you are a psychopath.' The study, called The dark Side Of Facebook, is published in the scientific journal Personality And Individual Differences.","Study found Facebook can also reveal narcissistic and Machiavellian traits .

"By . David Wilkes . Whenever Rebecca Brown was stressed or upset when she was growing up she would play with her hair for comfort. By the time she was 16 her habit had escalated into a full-blown psychological disorder - which left her almost completely bald. Doctors failed to diagnose the condition for five years, simply telling her to stop being a fidget. Meanwhile at school she endured cruel taunts and nasty looks from her classmates. Scroll down for video . Spelling it out: She wrote the name of her condition on her head to explain it to her online followers . Rebecca Brown started pulling her hair out at the age of 12 and by the time she was 16 she was nearly bald. When she was 19 the condition got so bad she was forced to shave her head completely (pictured) Feeling lost and alone, she started . taking a photograph of herself every day, chronicling her experiences on . the internet in a blog and in YouTube videos with brutal honesty. To her utter surprise the response was overwhelming – and to her delight it was supportive. As a result, her self-confidence has grown back – and so has her hair. Miss . Brown, now 20, has become a heroine to thousands of other sufferers of . trichotillomania, a disorder characterised by the uncontrollable urge to . pluck out the hair, usually from the scalp but also sometimes eyebrows . and eyelashes. Ms Brown took photos of herself every day for five years and posted a slide show of the pictures on YouTube. She is pictured in February 2012 when the condition was particularly bad . Ms Brown (pictured before she started pulling out her hair) said: 'Some people say trichotillomania is a result of childhood trauma but for me, pulling my hair has been a comfort thing. I do it a lot when I am stressed or upset' Her videos . have been viewed 12million times and she receives so much  fan mail . online it takes her three hours a week to reply to it all. She was even . mobbed by fans when she attended a conference on the condition in the . US  this year. Miss Brown . said: ‘I get a lot of post from people who confide in me about their . trichotillomania, yet they haven’t told their family or friends. I feel . very blessed that people trust me like that.’ Miss . Brown played with hair obsessively as a child and began pulling out . clumps when she was a teenager. She said: ‘I started going to the doctor . about it when I was 13 but they didn’t diagnose it until 18. Before I . was diagnosed, doctors advised me to do all sorts of silly things. One . doctor told me to stop fidgeting and another told me to sit on my hands. Ms Brown (pictured in 2012 after shaving her head) said she decided to make the videos about her condition when she realised how little information there was about it on the internet . As a result of her YouTube videos, Ms Brown (pictured in February 2012) had a large group of supporters who also have trichotillomania . ‘Some . people say trichotillomania is a result of childhood trauma but for me, . pulling my hair has been a comfort thing. I do it a lot when I am . stressed or upset. ‘A lot . of people at school and college didn’t understand why I was going bald. Lots of people mockingly called me “baldie”. But it was the horrible . looks that I got from other kids that was the worst thing.’ At one point . she had so little hair she shaved her head to make herself feel better; . at other times she wore wigs. She said: 'I get a lot of post from people who confide in me about their trichotillomania yet they haven't told their family or friends about it. I feel very blessed that people trust me like that' She said: 'It has given me a voice. I have found it hard to speak to counsellors about my problem but it has always felt easy to talk to a webcam' By . the time she was 14 she decided to find out for herself what was . happening to her. She did an internet search for ‘hair pulling’ and . discovered what trichotillomania was. Miss . Brown, from Chelmsford, Essex, said: ‘All that came up in the search . results were three not-so-brilliant videos on the disorder. ‘I . decided to upload my own, no-holds-barred video.’  In some photos, she . wrote the name of her disorder on her forehead in marker pen with an . arrow pointing to her last remaining bristles as she attempted to . explain the condition to the outside world. Miss . Brown, who is in her final year at film school in London, believes that . posting the videos on the internet has aided her recovery. ‘I have . found it hard to speak to councillors but it has always felt easy to . talk to a webcam,’ she said.

"By . John Stevens And Gareth Rose . A survey has found there has been a rekindling of a sense of British identity in Scotland - a blow to Alex Salmond, pictured, ahead of the Scottish independence referendum . More people in Scotland are describing themselves as British - and fewer as Scottish - as the campaign for independence turns off voters. The Scottish Social Attitudes survey found that the number of people who say they are British has increased from 15 per cent in 2011 to 23 per cent, while those who say they are Scottish has dropped from 75 to 65 per cent. The rekindling of a sense of British identity is the latest blow to Alex Salmond’s independence bid, just five weeks before the referendum on September 18. It appears to be most pronounced in women, just 27 per cent of whom back separation, compared to 39 per cent of men. This 12 point gap between the sexes is double that of 2013. The First Minister was routed in a TV debate against former chancellor Alistair Darling last Tuesday and has been struggling to turn around opinion polls that predict Scots will vote against breaking up the UK. When respondents to the survey were presented with a range of options from ‘Scottish, not British’ to ‘British, not Scottish’, the most popular choice was ‘equally Scottish and British’ (32 per cent) – its highest level since 1999. The number of people who said they were ‘British, not Scottish’, fell to 23 per cent, its lowest level in 15 years. The annual survey of 1,339 people saw a small increase in support for independence in the last year, from 36 per cent to 39 per cent, but revealed growing anxiety about how a Yes vote would affect Scotland.. Some 38 per cent fear its voice in world would be weaker – up from a quarter in 2013 and 22 per cent in 2012. While 44 per cent believe the economy would be worse – up from 34 per cent in both 2013 and 2012. Mr Salmond’s blokeish attitude has been widely cited as a reason that women have been put off voting for independence. John Curtice, co-director of the survey at ScotCen Social Research, said: ‘Although support for a Yes vote has increased during the last 12 months, more voters have in fact become nervous about the consequences of leaving the UK. ‘There are still insufficient voters who are of that view to deliver a majority for independence.’ Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, left, was routed in a TV debate against former chancellor Alistair Darling . Rachel Ormston, research director at ScotCen, said: ‘In the final weeks of the campaign, capturing women’s votes remains a key challenge, particularly for the Yes campaign. ‘Put off by uncertainty and less likely to be persuaded by patriotic arguments around “pride”, women still need to be convinced that independence will deliver on the economy and other areas.’ Mr Salmond yesterday predicted the independence referendum will attract the biggest turnout in Scotland’s history and draw people who have never voted before and do not feature in opinion polls. The SNP leader, a former racing tipster, urged political punters to put their money on an unprecedented 80% turnout. In a wide ranging interview at Edinburgh Book Festival, Mr Salmond, a former RBS economist, pinned much of the blame for the collapse of the bank on English workers in its capital markets division. ‘There hasn’t ever been a single employee of that division working in Scotland,’ he said. ‘Every single person works in the market division in London. ‘Now I’m not saying that therefore the headquarters in Gogarburn (Edinburgh) are absolved of all the craziness that they engaged into. I’m just pointing out that to see RBS’s failure as a particularly Scottish matter is also wrong.’ While discussing the popularity of Scottish nationalism through history, he told how his father wanted Winston Churchill hanged. He said: ‘My mum used to think Winston Churchill was the greatest man that ever lived. ‘My dad, of course, wanted to hang him. It was about what he did to the miners and things like that. ‘I remember once, and I’ve just done it again, when I was younger and more foolish as a politician I actually said that to a journalist and there was a headline saying: Salmond’s father wants to hang Churchill. ‘So I phoned my dad and said: “You probably saw the headline, I really shouldn’t have said that.” ‘He said: “No you shouldn’t, did I teach you nothing? Hanging was too good for that man.”’","Survey finds number of people saying they are British has increased to 23% .

"By . Lucy Osborne . A vicious Bull Terrier which ran out of a home to attack a dog walker was killed when police were forced to use Tasers on it. Leicestershire Police said it was necessary for its firearms officers to twice Taser the animal after it locked its jaw around the man’s knee and wouldn’t let go. The dog-walker was taking his pet Alsatian on its evening walk on a quiet residential street in Braunstone near Leicester when the attack happened on Sunday. Restraint: A vicious Bull Terrier which ran out of a home to attack a dog walker was killed when police were forced to use Tasers, similar to the one pictured, on it (file photo) The man, in his thirties, had to spend the night in hospital and his four and a half year old pet is believed to have almost died in the attack, which left it dripping in blood. The dog that launched the attack, believed by the police to be a Bull Terrier type, reportedly escaped from a nearby home. But police say no arrests have yet been made and the dog was not known to those in the area. The animal, which was not wearing a collar, was reportedly Tasered once from the front by a police officer but continued to attack, and then was Tasered again by another officer from behind. It died on the driveway in front of resident Mark Robinson’s family home, who later cared for the man and his dog while the police took care of the dead animal. ‘We heard cries for help outside on the road. I tried to stop it and went out there with another neighbour but we couldn’t get anywhere near it. ‘It was horrendous. There was blood everywhere. The dog, thought to be a pit bull terrier type similar to the one pictured, was reportedly Tasered once from the front by a police officer but continued to attack, and then was Tasered again by another officer from behind (file photo) ‘For about five minutes the dog . wouldn’t let go of the poor man’s knee. The police arrived really . quickly and after about fifteen minutes it was all over. ‘The . man and his dog came into the house after - he was white as a sheet and . even when the ambulance came to collect him, he didn’t want to leave . his dog who was in a really bad way.’ The . father-of-two who lives on the road with his wife and children, added: . ‘it’ s scary because I am often out there with my son and it could have . happened to us. ‘That dog . shouldn’t be alive and as far as I’m concerned the police did the right . thing. There’s nothing else they could have done to stop it.’ Mr . Robinson said the man that was attacked is well-known in the area . because he does a circuit around the neighbourhood with his dog every . morning and evening after work. ‘He always says hello when he walks past,’ he said. Walk:  The dog-walker was taking his pet Alsatian (similar to this breed) on its evening walk on a quiet residential street in Braunstone near Leicester when the attack happened on Sunday (file photo) The man, who last night spent a second night in hospital, makes his Alsatian wear a muzzle as a precaution, and was during the attack, so was unable to defend itself. The Alsatian, which was described by neighbours as a calm dog, was badly hurt but was last night released from a veterinary clinic. The man’s wife is believed to be seven and a half months pregnant with their first child, and was said to be ‘terrified’ when she heard about the attack. Police said the dog could have attacked its officers or members of the public if it had not been stopped. The force said in a statement: ‘In the interests of public safety, firearms officers were deployed to the scene. ‘On arrival the attacking dog continued to be aggressive and attack the dog and its owner.’ Police have asked for anyone with information about the attack to contact them. The Bull Terrier’s owner was not thought to have been with it at the time of the attack. Police said the owner may be arrested and charged with criminal offences. Tasers incapacitate people by administering an electric shock and are designed to be non-lethal weapons when used on humans.","Leicester police said it was necessary for firearms officers to Taser the dog .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . An 18-year-old woman reportedly lied about being abducted and held for 16 hours in Michigan - and investigators who determined her story was fake said Monday they plan to ask prosecutors to file charges against her. Police in the Detroit suburb of Ecorse, where Hayley Turner was found Friday, will send the case to the Wayne County prosecutor's office, Lt. Greg Blade said at a news conference. Charges could include filing a false police report, Blade said.

Tuner had cuts that appeared to be self-inflicted, Blade said. 'A lot of manpower was extended, a lot of time - I mean we truly wanted to help,' Blade said. 'It started not to click,' Chief Michael Moore said in the conference. 'My frustration level was very high. We are a cash-strapped city...and this cost us quite a bit of money.' Moore said Turner didn't act alone and was never in physical danger. 'They weren't looking for Ecorse. This is another instance where they were looking for Detroit,' Moore said. 'She could not do this alone and at no time was she never out of the company of a friend,' he said. Moore said he did not know if the person who helped Turner spoke to Monroe County investigators.

"By . Zoe Szathmary . A corporate email address belonging to the CEO of Hachette was shared by Amazon with its customers. In 'A Message from the Amazon Books Team,' Amazon said it has been campaigning against Hatchette for lower e-book prices. At the bottom of the message, Amazon wrote 'We'd like your help. Please email Hachette and copy us.' Immediately below those words were Hachette CEO Michael Pietsch's email address and an Amazon address. Campaign: Amazon listed Hachette CEO Michael Pietsch's email address in a letter, an excerpt of which is seen here, and asked customers to directly contact him . CEO: The email account of Hachette CEO Michael Pietsch, far left, was shared by Amazon . 'Hachette has already been caught illegally colluding with its competitors to raise e-book prices,' Amazon alleged in its letter. 'So far those parties have paid $166 million in penalties and restitution. 'Colluding with its competitors to raise prices wasn't only illegal, it was also highly disrespectful to Hachette's readers.' Amazon offered four talking points for customer emails in the message published on readersunited.com, AFP noted. One sample point echoed Amazon's earlier allegation: 'We have noted your illegal collusion.' A letter on authorsunited.net earlier appeared from writers complaining about Amazon. They alleged Amazon has intentionally made it difficult for customers to pre-order, buy and receive Hachette titles and '[b]oycotted Hachette authors.' Not me! Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' email was listed openly by the Authors United campaign, which has criticized the fight between Amazon and Hachette . Those authors, in turn, wrote 'We respectfully ask you, our loyal readers, to email Jeff Bezos, CEO and founder of Amazon' and listed his email address. 'Without taking sides on the contractual dispute between Hachette and Amazon, we encourage Amazon in the strongest possible terms to stop harming the livelihood of the authors on whom it has built its business,' they said. Amazon, however, has alleged its 'three separate offers to Hachette to take authors of out the middle' were rejected by the publishing company. MailOnline received a letter from Pietsch, 'which he's sending to every individual who has emailed him,' a spokesperson said. Pietsch said 'This dispute started because Amazon is seeking a lot more profit and even more market share, at the expense of authors, bricks and mortar bookstores, and ourselves.  Both Hachette and Amazon are big businesses and neither should claim a monopoly on enlightenment, but we do believe in a book industry where talent is respected and choice continues to be offered to the reading public. 'Once again, we call on Amazon to withdraw the sanctions against Hachette’s authors that they have unilaterally imposed, and restore their books to normal levels of availability.  We are negotiating in good faith.  These punitive actions are not necessary, nor what we would expect from a trusted business partner.' A request for comment to Amazon was not immediately returned.","As part of its fight against Hachette, Amazon shared Hatchette CEO Michael Pietsch's corporate email address .

Flight VS201, which was destined for London's Heathrow, was forced to turn back to Hong Kong International Airport after the 26-year-old man, identified only as 'Robert', became disruptive. The flight had been in the air for just over an hour-and-a-half when the passenger 'lost control and didn't follow instructions from staff'. Scroll down for video . Flight VS201, an Airbus A340 destined for London's Heathrow, was forced to turn back to Hong Kong International Airport after the 26-year-old man, identified only as 'Robert', became disruptive (file picture) Once the plane returned to the airport, the man was arrested and sent to hospital, authorities said. 'The foreign man called Robert, who is 26 years old, lost control on board and didn't follow instructions from staff on the flight,' a police spokesman told AFP. 'He was shouting... When the flight returned to Hong Kong, the man was arrested for violating aviation security ordinance and was sent to Princess Margaret Hospital,' he added. A Hong Kong airport authority spokeswoman said the plane, an Airbus A340, had departed at midnight. One passenger, who claimed to be on board the disrupted flight, said the man had to be restrained with belts during the incident. Katie Wong wrote on Facebook: 'He just gone out of control (sic). Talk loud and walking ard. Actually he touched my shouter (sic) and go intimidated at the aisle when the captain announced we're diverting the flight. A flight radar map shows the plane's flight path (in dark blue) and how it made a U-turn just 90 minutes after departing Hong Kong International Airport at midnight. The 'disruptive' man was arrested once it re-landed . 'The crew ended up put him down temporarily with an injection (we guess) and tied him up with belts.' Virgin Atlantic confirmed the flight had to turn back to Hong Kong after about 90 minutes, but was unable to confirm whether flight attendants had to restrain the man. A spokesman said: 'Virgin Atlantic can confirm that due to a disruptive passenger flight VS201 to London Heathrow returned to Hong Kong and was met by authorities on arrival. 'Virgin Atlantic does not tolerate disruptive behaviour by passengers on-board and the safety and welfare of our passengers and crew is the airline's top priority.' Katie Wong, believed to be a passenger on Flight VS201, said the man was 'out of control' and had to be tied up with belts by the crew in the process of being restrained. He was later taken to hospital after being arrested . Passenger left stranded by the incident were put up in hotels in Hong Kong and will fly out again on this evening. 'The rest of the passengers were provided with accommodation before they depart tonight,' a Hong Kong-based Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said. Police said this morning that the man had not yet been charged. Authorities were unable to confirm whether he was still in hospital and what treatment he had received.","Flight VS201 had to make U-turn just 90 minutes after departing Hong Kong .

So eager were they to serve their country, the youngest brother, who was just 14, borrowed his sibling's birth certificate to enlist. William (left), Arthur (top left), Gilbert (top centre), Ted (top right), Frank (right), Jim (bottom left), Sidney (centre) and Len (bottom right) fought in the First World War and miraculously all survived . Their service was acknowledged by King George V himself, who wrote to the men following the death of their army sergeant father. The monarch wrote to brothers Sidney, Gilbert, Ted, Will, Arthur, Frank, Len and Jim,  to say he was 'much gratified to hear of the manner in which they so readily responded to the Sovereign and their country.' Jansen Lord, the son of the third eldest brother Frank, said it was down only to sheer luck that all eight survived. 'It really is remarkable when you look back through the history of the war that they did all survive. I think it is absolute pure luck none of them were killed. 'One of them was wounded in the leg and one of the others was slightly gassed - which actually caused his death a long time afterwards - but other than this they were all healthy.

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Savers who try to reduce their inheritance tax bill could be forced to pay the levy up front under new proposals . Savers who try to reduce their inheritance tax bill could be forced to pay the levy up front under new proposals. Ministers are concerned that rising numbers of wealthy people are using complicated schemes to cut what they pay in taxes after their death. HM Revenue & Customs now suggests that those suspected of avoiding inheritance duty should pay it in full – while an investigation takes place into their tax affairs. Inheritance tax at 40 per cent is paid on estates worth more than £325,000 per person, and many more families have been dragged into the threshold in recent years. But some experts say the proposal, which is out for consultation, assumes someone is ‘guilty until proven innocent’ and people who use tax planning schemes legitimately could feel ‘criminalised’ by it. HMRC suggests that people who are suspected of using aggressive tax avoidance schemes should be liable to an ‘accelerated payment’ of inheritance tax during their lifetime. If after an investigation, they are found to have been acting legitimately, the money will be repaid. The Conservatives are sensitive to criticism of inheritance tax. The party promised to raise the threshold to £1million in 2007 – but no action has so far been taken. Inheritance tax brought in £3.4billion to the Exchequer last year – £1billion more than in 2009. But experts fear it is a target for tax avoidance. Nearly 3,500 tax avoidance schemes have been uncovered in the past decade, according to official figures. HMRC made clear that it does not want the new laws to affect trusts or schemes that are used legitimately by the ‘vast majority of people’. A spokesman said ‘very small numbers’ of wealthy people would be affected, with the focus on those who had taken ‘deliberate’ action to avoid tax. The proposal is part of the Government’s crackdown on tax avoidance, following a strong of high-profile cases such as that of Take That singer Gary Barlow. Inheritance tax can be avoided by putting certain financial assets in a trust, so tax does not apply. The proposal is part of the Government’s crackdown on tax avoidance, following a strong of high-profile cases such as that of Take That singer Gary Barlow, pictured . Stuart Phillips, of tax planning firm Private Office, told The Daily Telegraph: ‘The concern is that the Revenue takes a highly aggressive stance... and terrifies families who have been engaging in legitimate tax planning that has been used for many years. ‘I’m apprehensive that large-scale action could have unintended consequences.’ Around 26,000 people were liable for inheritance tax last year. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We are seeking views on tackling inheritance tax avoidance schemes. This is an ongoing consultation and no final decisions have yet been taken. ‘The proposals in the consultation paper will only affect a small minority of wealthy individuals who actively seek to avoid Inheritance Tax. ‘Couples would still be able to leave up to £650,000 tax free to benefit their children or grandchildren.’","Savers could be forced to pay inheritance tax up front under new proposals .

"By . Ashley Collman . A mother plans to breastfeed her premature baby while continuing to smoke marijuana -  against the advice of the doctors who delivered her child. Crystal Cain gave birth to her daughter Karrisma eight weeks early last Wednesday at Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland. Because her premature baby's immune system was already fragile, she planned to breastfeed but says doctors refused. Doctors at OHSU in Portland, Oregon kept a mother from breastfeeding her newborn after they discovered she was smoking marijuana. The eventually allowed the insistent mother after having her sign a form that acknowledges all the risks . While baby Karrisma is doing fine and has been taken off breathing machines, Cain disagrees with the doctor's advice. 'There are several studies that indicate that it doesn't, it can't transfer through your milk ducts.  Your body automatically kind of filters it,' Cain told KATU. Cain says she smoked marijuana throughout her pregnancy because her midwife said it would alleviate her nausea and anxiety. While the effects of marijuana on breastfed children has not been thoroughly studied since the drug is illegal in most states, the American Academy of Pediatrics advises against the practice. Some studies say children who consume breast milk from a marijuana-smoking mother are at higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome and that it may impact development. In the end, doctors at OHSU compromised with Cain by allowing her to breastfeed as long as she signed a form saying she understands the risks involved. 'We do understand the benefits of mothers' milk,' Dr Charles Kilo, OHSU's chief medical officer, said. 'We also don't want to be caught in a situation where a mother continues to use and says that we never gave her information on it, never informed about the risks, and so it's really a way of documenting that the parents acknowledge the risks. And we can't stop her from using it.' With recreational marijuana legalized in neighboring Washington, and medical marijuana in widespread use in Oregon, Cain believes more and more mothers are going to be demanding to breastfeed their children while taking the drug. Cain hopes this will lead to more research being done on the effects of breastfeeding while smoking marijuana. Oregon mothers breastfeed their children more than women in any other state, at an overwhelming 90 per cent rate.","Crystal Cain gave birth to daughter Karrisma last Wednesday .

"By . Emma Glanfield . These shocking images show the moment a man apparently helped lift a young girl over the barriers at a dangerous tombstoning spot before she leapt about 30ft into the water. CCTV footage of the dangerous incident shows the man apparently lowering the girl over jetty railings at Langstone Harbour, in the Eastney area of Portsmouth, Hampshire, before she daringly jumps off into the treacherous sea below. The harbour, where tombstoning is a known problem, is just a couple of hundred yards from South Parade Pier where 27-year-old Sonny Wells was left paralysed after jumping into the sea in 2008. The footage shows the man apparently lifting the young girl over the railings at Langstone Harbour, Hampshire . After being helped over the jetty railings, the girl flings herself from the pier and falls 30ft to the sea below . Bob Evans, sailing secretary of the Eastney Cruising Association which captured the latest incident on CCTV, said he was stunned by the footage. He said: 'I always thought this sort of thing was a problem with unsupervised kids. 'But as you can see, the photos show a man who appears to help a girl over the railings before she throws herself off. 'You can also see how close the boats can get to these kids in the water and that particular spot has a very strong tide especially on the ebb. 'Kids' heads and boat propellers need to be kept far apart.' Tombstoning was a common problem in the area last summer, and already this year boys have been seen jumping off Eastney's jetty. Tombstoning is a known problem in the summer at Langstone Harbour, near the Eastney area of Portsmouth . Prior to jumping from the pier, the girl appeared to be sizing up the jump with the man stood next to her . The girl appeared to be part of a group of young people who were jumping from the pier over the weekend . Portsmouth councillor Neil Young said youngsters were risking life and limb by tombstoning from the pier . The latest footage of people tombstoning was taken at Langstone Harbour in the Eastney area of Portsmouth . Six years ago, Mr Wells from Havant, Hampshire, was left paralysed after jumping 30ft from the nearby South Parade Pier. The keen footballer was just 20-years-old when he jumped from the pier in a 'moment of madness'. He had to be dragged from the water unconscious and airlifted by helicopter to Southampton General Neurological Unit. He was left paralysed from the chest down and will be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life after he broke his neck in the terrifying jump. Sonny Wells was 20-years-old when he was left paralysed after jumping from South Parade Pier, Southsea . Mr Wells was paralysed from the chest down after breaking his neck in the jump off South Parade Pier, Southsea, in 2008. He had to be dragged from the water unconscious before being flown to hospital (above) After viewing the latest images of teenager's tombstoning, his mother Jacqui Unal, 49, said: 'You only have to look at what happened to Sonny. 'I'm speechless.' Councillor Neil Young, in charge of children's services in Portsmouth, said that youngsters were risking life and limb by tombstoning. He also expressed concerns that they were jumping into water close to a sewage outlet. Louise MacCallum, from the Langstone Harbour Board, which manages the stretch of water, said: 'I can totally understand why people want to cool off by going in the sea. Mr Wells, with (left to right) friend Pauline Davey, Jo White and mother Jacqui Unal, has campaigned against tombstoning since his accident in 2008 . Alex Smith (left) and Sonny Wells (right), have both been left wheelchair bound after tomb-stoning accidents . 'But I know all too well that the sea can be a very dangerous place. 'You should always treat the coast with respect - it's easy to forget that when the sea is blue and everyone is eating ice creams. 'There are currents out there that are very strong, and if you are jumping into the sea, you don't know what's underneath - you could be injured or worse. 'We also have some big ships coming in and out. To spot a person in the sea is not always easy from a boat.'","CCTV footage appears to show man lowering young girl over jetty railings .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A cup of tea, fast internet connection and a trustworthy best friend are some of the bare necessities of modern life, according to a survey. The top 20 things Britons cannot live without also includes television, the iPhone, the family car and, for some, spectacles. Researchers compiled the list following a study carried out among 2,000 adults aged between 18 and 65. A daily shower and central heating also appear, as do a glass of wine and a pint.

The list revealed that more than one-third of us would struggle to cope without an ‘I love you’ every now and then, while the same percentage want cuddles and a solid marriage. A full English breakfast, coffee and chocolate also made the list, as did a night in on the sofa and a good cry every now and then. The poll was conducted to mark the forthcoming Blu-ray release of the 1967 Disney classic The Jungle Book, which features the song The Bare Necessities. For one in 20 people surveyed, life wouldn’t be complete without a foreign holiday once a year. And while women place cuddles as their number one ‘bare necessity’, men are more firmly attached to their television. For women, chocolate, a best friend, the heating and a cup of tea are all of high importance. But for men, it is a full fry-up, football and sausages. And while one-third of men can’t live without a pint of beer, only 7 per cent of women agree. Four in ten people admit until they had an iPhone they had no idea what a necessity it was, while 34 per cent say the same about their car, and 33 per cent about their spouse. Despite not wanting to live without their phone, television or car, 77 per cent of Britons claim every material item is replaceable. And 86 per cent believe people are guilty of overlooking the essential things in life such as love and friendship in favour of material things. For six in ten people, the bare necessities in life have changed as they have got older, with seven in ten claiming they have become less materialistic. But while 33 per cent of people claim they could function without a smartphone, laptop and social networking, 60 per cent would find it frustrating. The top five bare necessities were an internet connection, followed by television, a cuddle, a trustworthy best friend and a daily shower.

Step forward this daredevil, known only as Christian, as he runs at full pelt from a herd of oncoming bulls - a contender for the most dangerous selfie ever. The extraordinary images of the young man sprinting away from the rampaging, horned beasts at the Houston Bull Run in Texas made it onto the front page of social news and entertainment website Reddit, as well as Houston Press. Scroll down for video . Daredevil: Christian as he is known, took time out of his run to take the video, despite the pending goring . Daredevil: Christian taking a video of himself being chased by bulls . One runner was injured and was treated in hospital for cuts, scratches and concussion . Organizers of the event said they wanted to replicate the famous Spanish bull-running spectacle Pamplona . One onlooker took a photo of Christian's dangerous selfie, which was posted on Reddit along with the accompanying caption: ‘selfie level 11 achieved’- a recognition of the level of risk attached to the stunt. In Christian’s own video, crowds of people, many dressed in white outfits with red scarves around their necks, can be heard counting down from 10 as the herd of bulls is released. A voice can be heard shouting '36 bulls' as the animals are set free, before one daredevil in the crowd bellows 'hold your line!'. Seconds later a clearly nervous and excited Christian can be seen huffing and puffing in anticipation as the thunder of hooves is heard in the distance. He then starts running with an expression halfway between bewilderment and fear etched across his face. As the animals fly past, there is widespread shouting and applauding, but a crowd can be seen gathering around an injured man who has been trampled. More than 3,000 people took part in last month’s Houston Bull Run, with only one man, student Hugo Soto, treated for injuries in hospital. Injured thrill-seeker Soto was treated for scrapes and bruises to his face, arms and hands as well as concussion. Organizers of the event said the idea was to bring the great Spanish bull-running spectacle Pamplona closer to home.","Young man puts life at risk at the Houston Bull Run .

"By . Emma Glanfield . An investigation has been launched after thieves drilled through a pipeline underneath Nick Clegg's official country residence and siphoned £8.3million worth of fuel. Police said the gang stole about 30,000 litres of fuel a day over a period of seven months from the pipe underneath Chevening House estate, which is shared by the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. The fuel was funnelled along a 1,600 foot pipe to an area just outside the 3,500 acre estate near Sevenoaks, Kent, and pumped into huge plastic containers aboard lorries. Police said thieves drilled into a pipeline underneath Chevening House Estate near Sevenoaks, Kent (pictured), and stole £8.3million worth of fuel by siphoning it through a 1,600 foot long pipe over a seven-month period . The theft was discovered on Wednesday after new security measures were introduced on Esso's South East Pipeline, The Sun reported. The line, which is 120 miles long, carries fuel from Fawley Refinery in Hampshire to Purfleet Fuel Terminal and Gatwick. Kent Police said initial indications were that it had been 'a well organised crime'. A spokesman said: 'Kent Police was notified of some tampering to a fuel pipeline in the Sevenoaks area on August 6. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (pictured) shares the country residence in Kent with the Foreign Secretary .

The boat, named Walkabout, was hit by Hurricane Julio, which whipped up 155mph winds and 30ft waves, blowing a hatch off the boat and washing away its life raft. A terrifying picture released by the Coast Guard shows the rough seas the crew face, as they battle to keep their yacht afloat as it takes on water. Rough seas: The crew of the Walkabout have lost their life rafts and are taking on water . This image, taken by a NASA satellite, shows Hurricane Julio swirling over the Pacific Ocean . The three sailors, who have not been identified, sent out a Mayday message on Sunday morning and the Coast Guard is now co-ordinating their rescue. A HC-130 Hercules plane arrived on the scene at around 1:10pm local time yesterday to drop off life rafts to the stricken crew, but they were unable to reach them because of the huge waves which are battering the 42ft boat. A nearby container ship, Manukai, has now reached the sailors and will attempt a rescue at dawn. The Coast Guard has dropped life rafts to the stricken crew but they cannot reach them because of 30ft waves and 155mph winds caused by Hurricane Julio . A Hercules C130-J, similar to the planes used by the Coast Guard to co-ordinate the boat's rescue (file pic) Operations Specialist Andrew Lincoln said: 'The seas were really bad and it's kind of windy so [the Manukai crew] didn't want to do it in the dark. 'If seas were calm they'd pull up to the sailing vessel and [the three sailors] would climb up what's called a Jacob's ladder. 'But it's really rough out there so if [the Manukai] did that they'd end up running over that sailing vessel.' An earlier statement from the Coast Guard said: 'The Coast Guard is coordinating the rescue of a 42-foot sailboat caught in Hurricane Julio 414 miles northeast of Oahu Sunday. 'Sailing vessel Walkabout is disabled and taking on water with three people aboard. On-scene conditions are reported as 92 to 115 mph winds with 30-foot seas. 'One of the hatches has blown away and onboard bilge pumps are unable to keep up with the rate of flooding. The vessel's life raft has also been blown overboard.' Hurricane Julio, which was recently downgraded to category 1 - the lowest level of hurricane - is believed to be moving away from the area. Just last week Hawaii was battered by tropical storm Iselle, which toppled trees and power lines causing outages in parts of Maui. At least 50 flights were cancelled on Thursday because of the storm, but airlines have resumed normal service now.","Coast Guard planes circle stricken crew after hurricane blows hole in boat .

"By . Daniel Miller . Almost a fifth of Britain's mothers and fathers believe drinking alcohol actually helps make them a better parent, a disturbing new report has revealed. A survey by the charity 4Children highlights a 'silent epidemic' with a worrying six out of 10 parents claiming their drug or alcohol use had no effect on family life. Of those questioned, seven per cent admitting drinking every day while only nine per cent thought their drinking had a negative effect. Mothers' ruin: But just under a fifth of mothers and fathers questioned in a recent survey said they thought drinking made them a better parent . One in five said the thought their level of drinking impacted 'positively' on their parenting skills. Fathers were found to be more than three times as likely to drink every day than mothers and more than twice as likely to have tried illegal drugs. Many parents appear to turn to drink to help cope with the pressure of bringing up children with  17 per cent admitting they increased the amount of alcohol they consumed after the birth of their first child. Many reported feeling that having children actually encouraged them to drink more. Wealthier . parents were found to be four times as likely to drink every day than . poorer ones while older parents and women who were most likely to . dismiss the idea that alcohol or drugs could have a negative effect. Of the parents questioned for the 4Children survey: . Mark Bennett, Director of policy at 4Children said the finding back up the belief that many British parents view drinking alcohol 'as normal as drinking tea"". He told the Independent on Sunday: 'Part of the problem is people don't realise that they are causing problems by drinking to excess habitually. 'It could first be one glass, which leads to another. If parents have had a bottle of wine or more, their ability to react to their child, especially a small child, will be impaired.' Over a fifth of British children are believed to be living with a parent who drinks to dangerous levels while six per cent are thought to be living with a dependent drinker. Of British children who were subject to care proceedings, roughly 62 per cent had parents with a history of alcohol misuse with more than a third of all domestic violence cases involving alcohol. The charity is now calling for lessons of the dangers of alcohol abuse to be taught in schools as part of a 'major public information campaign'. And they want cigarette packet-style health warnings targetting pregnant women to be placed on bottles and cans. well as prevention strategies to be put in place, before alcohol and drugs 'take a grip on families'. The report follows a survey by parenting website 'Netmums' which found that nearly a third of mothers drink more than the government's recommended amount of alcohol. Founder of Netmums, Sally Russell, told the Independent: 'While it's always the priority that children are kept safe', it's also 'vital that parents feel supported in order to begin to change their behaviour, rather than feeling preached at. 'No parent wants to be an addict harming their own children, so services must work together to provide the best environment for change.'","Charity 4Children is calling for 'major information campaign'

"By . Emma Glanfield . A student who became obsessed with his singing teacher after falling in love while learning Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' has been ordered to stay away from her. Ashley Formby, 27, became infatuated with tutor Helen Sedgwick during their one-to-one music classes in which they learnt a number of love songs, including the Titanic power ballad. Formby, from Llandrindod Wells, Mid Wales, spent four months trying to woo his 26-year-old crush, and even told her he wanted to be her lover and not her pupil. Ashley Formby, 27, (right) showered tutor Helen Sedgwick, 26, (left) with an array of gifts and love letters after becoming infatuated with her during their regular one-to-one music classes in Llandrindod Wells, Mid Wales . He asked her to 'be my love' and told her she was 'the most beautiful girl in the world' before leaving a model replica of the Titanic as a 'romantic gift' at her home. However, Ms Sedgwick shunned his advances, and after continually being bombarded with love letters, emails and an array of gifts, reported him to police for stalking. Prosecutor Sharon Anderson said: 'She ignored him but during March and April he sent her flowers, gifts, emails and texts declaring his love for her. 'Ms Sedgwick responded telling him she was not interested in his approaches and found them inappropriate. 'She said that she did not want to provide him lessons but some of his messages became abusive. 'He replied calling her a spoilt brat. 'The tone of these new emails caused her anxiety and she was worried he'd attended her address.' After being bombarded with 'abusive' love letters and emails, Ms Sedgwick (above) reported Formby to police . Llandrindod Wells magistrates heard how officers served Formby with a harassment notice to stop him – but he ignored it and contacted her again to say he didn't want to fall in love with anyone else ever again. Over the course of the following 12 weeks he showered her with eight emails, a romantic card, three texts, gifts and turned up at her home with flowers. Ms Sedgwick, who also teaches piano at a primary school, called the police again because he would not stop his advances. Formby was then interviewed by officers and told them he felt he had a 'special bond' with Ms Sedgwick and that he had been 'devastated' when she rejected him. The court heard how Formby fell for the music teacher after she taught him Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On', which features in Titanic. Formby also sent Ms Sedgwick a replica of the sunken ship as a 'romantic gift' Josie Flicker, defending, said: 'He doesn't threaten violence, he is quite eloquent and shows genuine emotion. 'But he became quite childish when she rejected his advances. 'Since his arrest there has been no repetition, he seems to have heeded the warning from police.' Formby, of Llandrindod Wells, admitted pursuing a course of harassment when he appeared at court on Friday. He was given a restraining order to not to contact Ms Sedgwick or go within 200 yards of her home and the case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports.","Ashley Formby, 27, became infatuated with Helen Sedgwick during lessons .

"By . Sean O'hare . Dr Corascendea Cathar caught by a BBC investigation claiming she can treat cancer with special remedy . A spiritual healer who claims she can treat cancer with a special diet has been condemned by medical experts for giving 'dangerous advice'. Slovakian Dr Corascendea Cathar, 62, who has no medical qualifications, claims her 'Dhaxem' healing can prolong the lives of cancer victims by combating tumours. She was charging £280 a session. Today she has fought back and said the journalist who came to her as a customer saying her had cancer deserves it for misrepresenting her. But Professor Chris Bunce of charity Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research has hit out at Dr Cathar, saying that what she claims is 'scary'. Dr Cathar, whose real name is Dagmar Ebster-Grosz, from Cheltenham, maintains her treatments can help patients. Following the investigation by the BBC's Inside Out West TV programme Dr Cathar took the details of her treatments and price list off her website. The BBC undercover team took former cancer patient Chris Geiger, from North Somerset, to secretly film an appointment with Dr Cathar. For the purposes of the filming, Mr Geiger, who was treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma when in his 20s, claimed to have had a relapse and be looking for treatment. According to Dr Cathar's website, 'Dhaxem is a form of healing that centres around the understanding of own purpose in life. It incorporates the full array of all natural components working together in harmony and with the view of advancing the person to the next stage.' She believes it is impossible to repair an ailing body without searching for the roots of the disease in the Soul. In a two-hour session, Dr Cathar gave Mr Geiger dietary advice and told him: 'If you want to stop cancer, you have to get high doses of quality calcium.' She also told him that only he could heal his disease and needed to live a 'pure' life to do so. Cancer sufferer Chris Geiger, (pictured) from North Somerset, secretly filmed an appointment with Dr Cathar for a BBC programme . Dr Cathar . sent out a detailed diet to Mr Geiger for a £90 fee. The diet recommended cabbage . juice 'as it beats cancer' and a particular herbal mixture which Cancer . Research UK says holds no benefits for cancer sufferers . 'My Divine Spirit Guide Lysseus made Dhaxem available to me in December 2002, when he started speaking to me. Lysseus sees the energies in every molecule of my body and he specified several times a day what was needed for my repair (of hip joints). Lysseus equally saw every event that formed my Soul and what I did to bring about my every experience. All made sense, and as I purified, my body repaired at an equal rate. Since meeting in Egypt 560 BC, Lysseus and I shared 24 of the 28 pivotal incarnations that we each had. We were sisters, we were a couple, and we were un-related. We died as a Cathar husband and wife in the 13th Century in France, and we met as two men with different interests during Renaissance, in today's Italy. We were friends and we were enemies. The connection between our Souls formed over the two and a half thousands of years of our Spiritual Growth is not subject to time, or place.' She claimed to have added ten years onto the life of a patient with terminal cancer. After the appointment, Dr Cathar also . sent out a detailed diet for a £90 fee. The diet recommended cabbage . juice 'as it beats cancer' and a particular herbal mixture which Cancer . Research UK says holds no benefits for cancer sufferers. After the visit, Mr Geiger said: 'It makes me feel really angry when I heard what she was saying today. I just so hope that people aren't taken for it and that she stops what she is doing immediately."" Prof Bunce, who is research director for the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research charity and a Professor of Experimental Haematological Oncology at University of Birmingham's School of Biosciences, viewed the BBC's undercover footage. He said of Dr Cathar's advice: 'I think it's dangerous. You've got to remember the people she's talking to are scared and frightened. 'You know this kind of thing goes on but to actually see it happening is quite scary.' Speaking to Mail Online, Dr Cathar said: 'I work in a non-conventional way and my website says this. 'I work under the guidance of my spiritual guide, whereas these doctors work from books. It's a matter of opinion. Dr Corascendea Cathar's website  no longer offers her services as a healer and now functions solelyy as a means of educating others about Dhaxem . 'I had been working on a detox diet . for this guy and was going through hundreds of different ingredients and . my spiritual guide told me cabbage juice would work for him . He then went away and wrote all these things about me which are just not relevant to what I do. 'I can say if he does have cancer he deserves it. 'It's like going to the Chinese and complaining that you can't buy normal groceries.' Dr Cathar claims to have cured three people with cancer and her website shows the profiles of two dogs which she claims she treated for cancer. Since removing the pricing and details of her treatment she says she no longer practices and instead works as a linguist and uses her Dhaxem website purely to educate others. In summer of 2003, Sophie looked suddenly gaunt. Her strong muscles were disappearing from her body as I watched. The speed of her deterioration horrified me. We seemed to be running out of time. I asked Lysseus (Dr Cathar's spiritual guide) whether he would heal Sophie of the cancer, and he said 'Yes'. To succeed, even a carnivore had to be made vegan, as entirely toxins free fish would have been difficult and red meet practically impossible, to find in a supermarket or at a butcher. Fighting a malignant outbreak in the body requires an immune system as efficient as can be, and lumbering it with toxic intake via meat as 'food', would have defeated the purpose.I cooked for Sophie a diet of crushed aduki with a smaller amount of mung beans, with organic oats and rye (after meat, wheat is also unsuitable for cancer), and I gave her multiple calcium, vitamin and mineral formulas in under normal circumstances unacceptable amounts - every three hours, day and night, for the first three weeks, which then extended to every six hours for another two months. I understood from Lysseus that although new cancer cells were still being made, after this phase, the body's immune system became strong enough to reduce their numbers by about the same rate as they generated, which meant that the spread of the cancer was under control. Treatment over the subsequent three months allowed us to suppress the disease. Within about four months from starting the treatment, Sophie's immune system became able to render harmless all existing, as well as the developing cancer cells in her body. Maintaining moderate amounts of calcium and other remedies over the next three years helped Sophie's body to gather the malignant cells into clearly defined pockets which were surgically removed in three stages by April 2006.","Dr Cathar claims she is directed by her spiritual guide .

Milltown Partners, who specialise in discreet reputational work for high-end clients, was founded by Paddy Harverson, former Royal spin doctor, and ex-Google executive DJ Collins. And BBC sports editor David Bond is set to join. The choice of Milltown also highlights the cosy governance set-up at the Premier League, which has to be reformed even if Scudamore stays in office. All-powerful Scudamore’s effective line managers are the PL’s audit and remuneration committee, who decide his bonus and salary. Serious: The Premier League have hired a crisis management agency to try and help Richard Scuadamore . Doubt: There are growing concerns whether Scuadamore's friend Bruce Buck should be A and R chairman . And that group is chaired by Scudamore’s close friend and shooting partner Bruce Buck, chairman of Chelsea. And Chelsea happen to be another client of Milltown. As a result, there are growing concerns as to whether Buck should remain chairman of the A and R group. The PL strongly defend their ridiculous two-strong board of Scudamore and interim  chairman Peter McCormick, whose Harrogate firm receive a considerable proportion of their business from the PL. The PL claim the 20 clubs, who meet at least six times a year, are the directors of the company. But their one-eyed focus is purely on their own fortunes. Sofa time: Steven Gerrard will pause his World Cup preparations to work with ITV for the Champions League final . England captain Steven Gerrard will be a guest pundit with ITV for the Champions League final. Gerrard will now be spending a fortnight in Portugal. He is on holiday this week, followed by training with England at Vale do Lobo before the final in Lisbon. PREMIER LEAGUE sponsors Barclays, who have reportedly voiced upset over Scudamore’s sexist emails, are to change PR agencies. It is widely expected that Barclays will not renew their current three-year deal with the top flight, but they will hire Havas and instruct them to do a root-and-branch look into how much value the £40m-a-year PL backing brings to a bank involved in a major cost-cutting exercise. THE highly prestigious Footballer of the Year function was relegated to a cramped basement room at London’s Royal Lancaster Hotel because of a switch of dates. The main reception suite, instead of being adorned with evocative pictures of every winner of the Football Writers Association award, was booked by the British Sandwich Industry. And rather than Luis Suarez being honoured in the big room, it was a BBQ chicken and bacon slaw wrap and a prosciutto and asparagus melt. Ian’s priorities wrong . It will not please followers of rugby league giants Wigan Warriors that their chairman Ian Lenagan has chosen to go to the FA Cup final rather than his club’s Super League Magic Weekend clash with Leeds at the Etihad Stadium. Lenagan is also chairman of League Two  football team Oxford United and an FA councillor. He was one of four councillors who spoke out in favour of Hull City owner Assem Allam being allowed to change the name of the club to Hull Tigers which the FA voted to reject. Meanwhile, it’s understood the astonishing decision for the Hull KR v Hull Super League fixture to be staged in Manchester at the same time as Hull City take on Arsenal in the FA Cup final at Wembley wasn’t opposed by Hull rugby league club owner Adam Pearson. He used to be head of operations at the football club, but had an acrimonious exit following Allam’s takeover. Shock: Rugby League owner Adam Pearson didn't oppose the Hull sports clashes this Saturday . Matthew Syed might have been discarded by Joey Barton as ghost writer for his upcoming autobiography but the Times sports columnist has emerged as front runner to be the next BBC Sports Editor. However, there appears to be a split of opinion on the selection panel as to whether the Beeb want a talking head like Syed or a big story getter to replace the departing David Bond. The England Cricket Board are to lose their highly successful commercial chief John Perera, who has remarkably brought in more than £750m worth of sponsorship and TV rights during nearly a decade dominated by a financial recession.

"By . Alex Lazcano For Daily Mail Australia . A Qantas pilot has taken tiny wallaby joeys under his wing by flying them in the cockpit of his passenger jets between two zoos involved in a foster program aimed at boosting the species' flagging population. When called upon, Nathan Koch, who is also a qualified vet, carries the joeys in lunchboxes on board flights he is piloting between Adelaide and Canberra and hands them to keepers from Adelaide Zoo or Canberra's Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve upon arrival. The two centres are involved in a cross-species scheme in which southern rock and yellow footed joeys are taken out of their mothers' pouches and, when required, placed in a female wallaby 1200km away. The program has helped double wallaby numbers by speeding up the animals' reproduction cycle and making use of females which aren't pregnant. Nathan Koch is also a practicing vet who not only transports the joeys to be fostered, he also implants them . A tiny wallaby is implanted into a foster wallaby's pouch as a part of a breeding program. 'It all started off as a bit of a coincidence, I was piloting a flight and I received a permit for wildlife to be on board,' said Mr Koch. 'I was expecting a huge animal enclosure but David Schulz of the Adelaide Zoo showed up with what looked like a small lunchbox. He explained the program to me and I was interested in getting involved. 'If breeding goes well wallabies can be pregnant back to back, so while one develops, another is in an earlier stage of development until the older one leaves the pouch.' The program allows the wallaby mothers to rear up to six or seven times a year rather than once, making a big impact on the population. Scott Ryan, from the Adelaide Zoo, said: 'If all four of our females are breeding we would normally only result in four joeys if all goes well but with the cross fostering program we are able to ideally result in eight healthy wallabies.' The southern rock wallaby joeys travel in small lunchboxes that act as humidi-cribs in the pilot's cockpit . Mr Koch a practicing vet hands over the joeys to a ranger after transporting them interstate. Mr Koch added: 'My part is only small, it's the zoo and the reserve that do most of the hard work and have come up with this amazing program that is working. I am  thrilled to be involved and do my part. The joeys only spend about six months with their foster mother before being transported back to their original species. 'The fact that yellow footed wallabies don't have a breeding season, it means that they can be breeding year long and their young can be reared by the southern brush tailed wallabies when they are off their breeding season,' said Mr Scott. 'If we didn't have the partnership with Qantas and without Nathan, the process would take much longer and it wouldn't be as easy on the animals because Nathan gets the joeys from the plane straight to the pouches. There is no lag time. A Qantas spokesman said: 'Qantas is delighted to support Captain Nathan Koch in his involvement in the breeding program. It's only right that these precious little joeys travel with the Flying Kangaroo.' Pilot and practicing vet Nathan Koch implants a joey for the breeding program in Adelaide and Canberra .

"By . James Rush . For most people, managing to catch one baseball at a Major League game would be considered something of a proud and memorable moment. But one baseball fan has taken things to another level entirely after collecting a staggering 7,537 balls, which he keeps in his apartment in Manhattan, New York. Zack Hample, 36, has now made it his life's mission to collect 10,000 balls by snagging them from the stands at games. Scroll down for video . Zack Hample, 36, has collected a staggering 7,537 baseballs, which he keeps in his apartment in Manhattan, New York . Mr Hample estimates he has spent somewhere in the region of $100,000 and tens of thousands of hours honing his technique for being in the right place at the right time. He said: 'I wasn't good enough to be a Major League Baseball player but I'm still probably better at judging and catching fly balls than 99.9 per cent of the public. 'When I'm at a game and the ball goes up in the air I'm not even looking at it - I'm already running and climbing over rows and planning my path and dodging vendors and people. 'Then I look up and if I've done a good job the ball's right there for me to catch.' Mr Hample, who has even written books teaching others how to catch balls at games, began his hobby at the age of 15 and soon became obsessed with collecting balls. He now attends roughly three games every week during the course of the baseball season and has come up with a number of tricks to ensure he never leaves a stadium empty-handed. Mr Hample estimates he has spent somewhere in the region of $100,000 and tens of thousands of hours honing his technique for being in the right place at the right time . Mr Hample, pictured with his girlfriend Hayley, began his hobby at the age of 15 and soon became obsessed with collecting balls . He said: 'There are a lot of strategies I use to catch so many baseballs, starting with showing up early for batting practice and bringing a glove. 'I get a lot of balls thrown to me by the players and I ask foreign guys in their native languages. 'I have a hat and shirt of all Major League teams, so I can dress up like I'm a fan of whatever team is on the field. 'I'm definitely obsessed with this, it's definitely an addiction.' However, his passion for collecting baseballs leaves little time for long-suffering girlfriend, Hayley, 20. She said: 'I think if push came to shove and he had to choose he'd probably go with baseball but that's just who he is. Mr Hample has now made it his life's mission to collect 10,000 balls by snagging them from the stands at games . 'There's just no escaping it when I'm with him and it's game time. 'I think I would be less supportive of it if he weren't the king of it, but since he basically created this whole world I feel like I have to support him.' Now Mr Hample, whose first book was called How To Snag Major League Baseballs, says he won't stop until he has collected 10,000 baseballs. He said: 'Perhaps the biggest appeal for me in collecting baseballs is feeling like I'm beating the odds and getting something special. 'When the ball sails through the air 40,000 people are watching it - and who knows how many hundreds of thousands of people at home - and that ball ends up in my glove. 'It's just the most amazing feeling, there's really not much else in the world that compares with that.'","Zack Hample, 36, has collected 7,537 baseballs from Major League games .

"By . Marielle Simon For Daily Mail Australia . Homophobic abuse is rampant in our schools with new research revealing that 80 percent of students experienced distressing comments in PE classes. The beyondblue study found that casual comments such as 'you're so gay', which may not have been intended to upset someone, were causing mental health problems in students with higher levels of depression and anxiety reported. The research led by Victoria University was based on 399 Australian secondary school students between the age of 14 and 22 and focused on young people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual and gender diverse. Scroll down for video . Research reveals PE classes can be a problematic environment for people, with homophobic behaviour a common occurrence (stock image) Leading the study, Dr Caroline Symons from Victoria University, says although aware of the term 'gay' being casually used, it was a surprise to learn that majority of Australian secondary students attracted to same sex found it so distressing. ‘It’s part of this negative mirror about them being gay. It doesn’t help them very much with their self-acceptance.’ Apart from verbal homophobic abuse, the research also found that a quarter of young people in school PE lessons reported physical abuse and pushing. The survey also looked at the effect homophobic bullying has on students mental health, by comparing the levels of stress, anxiety and depression in the participants to a sample of 187 straight students. ‘The results showed severe ratings of depression among gay and lesbians were almost double of that of their counterparts,’ says Dr Symons. The paper highlights PE as a particularly problematic environment with substantial homophobic behaviour. ‘Sport can be a challenging environment for gays and lesbians. It is very gender orientated and it has traditional ways of being male and female. Dr Caroline Symons (pictured left) from the Institute of Sport Exercise and Active Living at Victoria University says rates of depression among homosexual students was double that of straight students (stock image right) ‘The gender traditions are reinforced in the rules of sport and have been shown to be very difficult for students at a critical age range, 14-22 years, beginning their involvement in sport and forming life-long physical activity patterns.’ Chief Executive Officer of beyondblue, Georgie Harman, says their organisation is committed to finding out reasons for depression and preventing it. 'Sport and physical activity is a preventative and protective role, it is very troubling that at an important time with understanding their sexuality, they are subjected to that abuse.' Ms Harman says that this study was extremely important in identifying a place in which this behaviour happens. As a result of the findings, beyondblue has called for a stand on the type of language used in schools, the intervention of teachers and the creation of an inclusive and safe environment for students experiencing homophobic abuse. Dr Symons says there are gay and lesbian awareness initiatives currently in place in Australia and the UK that focus on sports, however greater awareness and equipping teachers and schools on how to tackle homophobic abuse is the key.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . The way aviation authorities assess the risks of flying in dangerous areas has been slammed as 'not good enough' by the British pilots' organisation Balpa. In the wake of the MH17 tragedy, the group has claimed that risk assessments by aviation authorities and airlines can create 'an illusion of safety' and said they are vulnerable to commercial pressure. Balpa's general secretary Jim McAuslan called for a uniform approach on safety across the board 'not one that is decided in secret'. Tragedy: The British pilots' association Balpa has hit out at safety decisions following the MH17 disaster . Danger zones: Air Traffic Flight paths on radar changed over Donetsk in the Ukraine, after the downing of Malyasia Airlines MH17 . The comments come after it was revealed that although . airlines are no longer flying over Ukraine, there have been instances . since last week's crash where passenger planes have flown over the . war-torn areas of northern Iraq and Syria. Strong words: Balpa general secretary Jim McAuslan claimed the way safety decisions are made is 'not good enough' Mr McAuslan said it was important to look at 'failures' that led to the Malaysia Airlines disaster. Some . US and European carriers, including the UK's easyJet, are not flying to . Israel today after a rocket landed near Tel Aviv airport. Balpa . today called for global leadership from the International Civil . Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in all operations in or over areas of . hostility. Balpa . said that although ICAO is the UN body responsible for co-ordinating . the safety and order of global aviation, maybe it should have a greater . leadership role and strengthened powers to go with that responsibility. Mr . McAuslan said: 'Individual pilots looking at their flight plans need to . have absolute confidence that the right calls are being made. The . process behind the choice of airspace routing is based on a risk . assessment; both by a country's national aviation security services in . the advice that they give to their airlines, and by the airline in how . they assess this advice. 'This . risk assessment approach can give an illusion of safety but it is in . fact vulnerable to all sorts of influences including commercial pressure . and so it is not surprising to us that there are differences in the way . that this risk is assessed by different airlines.' He went on: 'That is not good enough. Passengers and pilots want a uniform level of safety, not one that is decided in secret. Paying tribute: Flowers have been laid outside the Netherlands Embassy in Kiev to remember those lost on flight MH17 . 'While . the ultimate responsibility of last week's murders lies with the people . who apparently directed a missile at a peaceful civil airliner, this . should not prevent us looking at the failures that led to that outcome; . failures that could easily be repeated in other areas of conflict.' Mr McAuslan added: 'ICAO's purpose . should be to lead where national authorities cannot and it should have . the tools to do that. The problem of the absence of a clear . international co-ordination to avoid operations above eastern Ukraine . has now become tragically obvious and to avoid a repeat ICAO should be . better resourced and enabled to declare airspace unsafe. 'ICAO . also needs to reflect on its own rules of membership. Participating . states enjoy privileges such as free movement, but with that comes . responsibility. If a state does not live up to that responsibility, such . as sharing of information and allowing full and free access to accident . investigation, then membership and privileges should be reconsidered.'","British pilots' association Balpa said a uniform approach to safety is needed .

"By . Christian Gysin . Face hidden behind a veil, and towered over by fellow protesters, a girl believed to be around 12 waves a ‘jihadi’ flag in a street demonstration against ‘crimes against Islam’. She is shown, in the left of the picture, mingling with supporters of the extremist preacher Anjem Choudary in a rally against the Saudi Arabian government. Some of those in the group outside the country’s  embassy in central London appeared to be no older than six. Rally: This child (left), thought to be no older than 12 has been pictured waving a black 'jihadi' flag during a protest outside the Saudi Arabian embassy in London . The flag the girl waved features the Shahadah – a Muslim declaration that Allah is the only god – which is included in the green Saudi Arabian flag. But when the Shahadah is depicted on a black background it is associated with extremist causes in both Egypt and Syria. In recent times it has been identified with Islamist terrorist groups including Al Qaeda. In the past such black Shahadah flags have been seen as backdrops for videos recorded by suicide bombers. Some weeks ago London Mayor Boris Johnson called for children subjected to radicalisation to be taken into care to protect them from parents with extremist views. Ghaffar Hussain, of the counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, described the pictures of the little girl at the protest as ‘disturbing’. Youngsters: Some even younger protesters, who appeared to be no older than five or six, were also at the rally in London . ‘There is a very real issue with children being radicalised and brought along to these demonstrations to be given hate messages,’ he said. ‘It’s something that needs to be tackled. Children are being normalised into extremism. It’s very dangerous.’ Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘Social services and police need to be very vigilant to make sure that children are not being radicalised and subjected to a form of dangerous psychological abuse. Parents should take care not  to allow their children to be involved  n supporting, in any way, the activities of Al Qaeda. ‘For adults this is a matter of choice. For those too young to understand this could be the first step on the road to radicalisation.’ Cause: The girl had joined a rally held by supporters of the extremist preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured) last week to highlight the Middle Eastern country's 'crimes' Yesterday Anjem Choudary took to Twitter to berate the MP and other critics, writing: ‘Now Keith Vaz and the Quilliam Foundation want to take our children away because they carry the Shahadah flag. Maybe they should embrace Islam.’ The preacher added: ‘There has been controversy over these flags but they have been around since the time of Muhammad himself and are loved, cherished and belong to every single Muslim. ‘Black or white flags carrying this statement have always been carried in battles between Muslims and non-Muslims to distinguish the two camps of Islam and Kufr [non-Islam].’ Mizanur Rahman, of the Muslim Prisoners campaign group which organised the demonstration, added: ‘There is nothing controversial about inviting famous speakers or flying the traditional Islamic flag. What is controversial is the crimes against Islam and Muslims in the UK and abroad.’ London Assembly member Murad Quresh maintained that the flag was used by jihadis, saying: ‘It’s the black rather than green colour that makes it distinctive. ‘It should be of huge concern that young children are coming under the influence of Anjem Choudary and his mob.’","Girl joined a rally held by supporters of preacher Anjem Choudary last week .

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . James Packer's new Crown Casino was cleared to run a new high-rollers casino in just three months, which the body responsible for approving it believes could be the fastest time in history. Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority chief executive Micheil Brodie said the speedy probity clearance was far below the average of the 12 months it normally takes, according to The Sydney Morning Herald . Mr Brodie, who oversaw the probity check, said the process was fast-tracked because the NSW government advised the gaming authority to take into account the findings of an earlier probity check into Mr Packer's company. James Packer's Crown Resorts cleared a probity check in just three months to run a new casino in Sydney . The speedy seal of approval for the casino (artist's impression pictured) was possibly 'one of the fastest assessments of a casino applicant in history' compared to the average of about 12 months . Mr Brodie said the punch-up between long-time mates Mr Packer and Mr Gyngell out the front of the media mogul's Bondi apartment in May didn’t affect the decision for the application because it was based on the company and not individuals. ‘That’s not to say that if someone was a person with a significant history of the use of violence for commercial objectives that we wouldn’t take a very, very serious view about whether they are a suitable person,’ he told the Sydney Morning Herald. ‘But someone who ends up having a bit of a set-to with their mate out the front of the house one Sunday afternoon doesn’t, by definition, mean they’re going to be unsuitable to be a director of a company that will hold a licence under the Casino Control Act.’ The authority re-interviewed Mr Packer and other key management heads but said it was able to use information from the earlier probity check done in 2012. Last month, Crown Resorts was granted a licence to operate a VIP-only restricted gaming facility, without poker machines, at Barangaroo from November 15, 2019 after the NSW government backed its proposal.

Passengers are now being bussed back to their destination more than an hour away. Izzy Ferris, 19, who was on board the flight, said: ‘We were just flying over Barcelona and this storm came out of nowhere. ‘We were hit by lightning, it was absolutely terrifying. There was a massive loud bang and a lot of flashing. ‘Everyone is fine but a lot of the women were screaming and crying and the cabin crew were flung down the plane. ‘I think one guy even saw the lightning go all the way around the plane. ‘We had to make an emergency landing because of it all, they're putting us all on buses to go back to Barcelona.’ Diverted: The easyJet flight was rerouted to Spain's Reus Airport due to storms .

Bonuses: Six months afer MPs called for Lloyds CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio, pictured with wife Ana, to be stripped of his £2.5m bonus and the bank was fined for promoting a ruthless sales culture, a leaked email has revealed staff are being pressurised into mis-selling credit cards, loans and insurance . Lloyds is continuing to pressurise staff to mis-sell credit cards, loans and insurance, a leaked email has revealed – just months after the bank was fined £28million for promoting a ruthless sales culture. The email, which has emerged a week after Lloyds’s bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance topped £10billion, reveals the aggressive sales culture which still pervades the bank. It was sent by an unnamed regional manager to a branch and shows how employees are set strict targets to make as many appointments with customers as possible. It uses industry jargon such as ‘helping’ customers with credit cards, and ‘needs met’ to describe sales. Staff are also set targets for ‘referrals’, which means passing a customer to another department of the bank which will try to sell them a different product or investment. This is known in the industry as ‘cross-selling’. In the email, the manager piles the pressure on branch staff and chastises them for falling short. It says: ‘I will require the number of lending appointments booked again by email before you go home from every branch. Detail needed – how many lending [sic] booked for the next 5 days, how many advisers in the business.’ Referring to the number of daily appointments advisers are expected to make in a week, it warns: ‘I’ll give you a clue that 1’s, 2’s and 3’s are simply not acceptable.’ Another extract states: ‘9 customers helped with a credit card (which embarrassingly is our busiest day of the week!!!). With volumes and productivity being measured, I don’t understand how 43 advisers can only help 20 customers with an internet (a free product?) and 0 with a credit card (another free product?)’ The manager warns that staff who fail to hit targets will see bonuses cut. ‘Come on team you are better leaders than these numbers are telling me. You have ten working days left this quarter to make a difference to your half year.’ Mark Brown, of Lloyds Trade Union, which represents staff at the bank and has alerted the City watchdog to the email, describes this as a clear ‘threat’. He added: ‘It’s not even implied. It’s gratuitous, offensive and menacing.’ The union has accused the bank of setting ‘unachievable targets’, adding that these ‘drive the wrong kind of behaviours, to the detriment of customers potentially’. Leaked: The email was sent by an unnamed regional manager to a branch and shows how employees are set strict targets to make as many appointments with customers as possible . The email was written in June – six months after Lloyds was fined a record £28million for promoting a sales culture in which some workers were told their pay would be halved if they missed targets. Staff were handed ‘champagne bonuses’ for selling customers investments they did not want or need. One salesman sold insurance to himself, his wife and a colleague to prevent his salary from being cut. At the time MPs called for chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio to be stripped of his £2.5million bonus. Last night Lloyds insisted the email ‘is in no way representative of behaviour across the group’, adding it had launched an internal investigation and was taking disciplinary action. The bank, which was bailed out with £20billion of taxpayers’ money in 2008, said it has ditched sales targets, and bonuses are based on ‘balanced scorecards’, which gauge feedback from customers. But it admitted advisers must  generate a certain number of appointments and ‘needs met’. Campaigner James Daley,  of Fairer Finance, said: ‘Banks still haven’t got to grips with the root cause of mis-selling. This email clearly shows a squeeze on staff to drive more sales. Banks should stop shoving products down customers’ throats’.","Email emerged a week after bank's bill for mis-selling PPI topped £10billion .

"By . Professor Larry Goodyer . The rapidly spreading, deadly ebola outbreak in Africa is a cause  for grave concern – although health officials stress that Britons need not worry unduly. It does, however, highlight how important it is to take precautions when visiting countries where there is a possibility of contracting diseases unheard of at home. Here, PROFESSOR LARRY GOODYER, head of the Leicester School of Pharmacy at De Montfort University and deputy chairman of the British Global and Travel Health Association, explains how to avoid everything from traveller’s tummy, to something more serious. Scroll down for video . Safe travels: Ensuring you have had all the jabs, avoid high-risk areas and make sure food is property cooked are easy ways to avoid falling ill on holiday . The average traveller isn’t really at risk from ebola, right? Ebola is an extremely serious disease but the vast majority of travellers aren’t at risk. Ebola seems to be a problem predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. Some animals there appear to carry the disease. Outbreaks in humans probably occur as a result of eating the meat from those wild animals or handling carcasses that harbour the virus. Ebola is then passed from person  to person through direct contact with bodily fluids, either through intimate contact, caring for someone with the condition, or from being in an area where there is an outbreak. I’m travelling in an area where cases have been reported. How do I stay safe? Quarantine arrangements are in place in those areas affected and must be obeyed. As a precaution, avoid eating ‘bush meats’ of any wild animals such as fruit bats or monkeys. Other than that, follow the same advice we always give to reduce the risk of general illness and stomach upsets. Practise good hygiene by washing your hands with soap and water and regularly use a sanitising hand gel, too. If you do travel to Africa and develop a fever, flu-like symptoms, feel generally ill or your temperature is raised, seek medical advice for a variety of reasons, including malaria. Low-risk for tourists: Yes, Ebola is real, but it is only passed from person to person through direct contact with bodily fluids . Is sitting next to someone enough to catch ebola? Even if you were sitting near someone on a plane who was infected, you’d still need to come into direct contact with their bodily fluids to contract the disease. If I suspect someone is unwell on a plane, what should I do? It could be down to many ailments including flu, a stomach upset, or even a hangover. If someone was critically ill they wouldn’t be allowed on a plane, and if they fell ill on board, the pilot would seek advice. It would be irresponsible of passengers to cause panic because someone appeared unwell, but you could discreetly alert the cabin crew of your concerns. If I get ill on holiday, might I be stopped from travelling home? If you had ebola you wouldn’t be allowed to fly home – you’d be in quarantine and receiving emergency treatment. So I don’t need to worry about . ebola. But the family is off on holiday in a fortnight and we haven’t . really thought about vaccination – what should we do? It’s . important you have any required vaccinations six weeks in advance of . your trip. If it’s only two weeks, or less, until your holiday, go to . your GP or local travel clinic immediately to be vaccinated. They’ll . tell you what you need for the country you are visiting. Crucial: It is important everyone in your family has the appropriate vaccinations . So once we’re vaccinated,  we don’t need to worry? It’s important to be vigilant about your health when travelling. For example, if you’re going to an area where malaria is prevalent, you may need to take medication to protect yourself from it. Take steps also to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, as this is how malaria is contracted. Use a bug spray and sleep with nets over your bed. Read up on the symptoms so you know if you develop any. There are lots of common ailments you can’t be vaccinated against but that can be debilitating, such as traveller’s tummy, so being prepared is important. Are there medicines or a  first-aid kit that every family should take when going abroad? Stock a medical kit with simple items for cuts, grazes and sprains, and ensure you have antiseptic cream, antihistamines and sterile dressings for mosquito bites. Also, carry painkillers, anti-inflammatories and loperamide to help stop diarrhoea. Always pack sachets of rehydration salts as dehydration can be dangerous after a stomach upset or sickness. If you’re going on an adventure holiday, you might need specific medicines, such as drugs for altitude sickness. I advise against buying medicines while in Africa – even paracetamol – because of the huge number of counterfeit products. What exactly is  traveller’s tummy? A form of E.coli called enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is the most common cause, and symptoms include diarrhoea, cramps and sometimes fever and nausea. Food that’s not cooked thoroughly, isn’t hot enough or has been sitting on a buffet for a long time and has flies on it is the main cause. Can drinking a little of the  local water help prevent me from catching traveller’s tummy? To get any kind of resistance takes months, if not a year. Although food is more risky than water when it comes to bugs, I would still always drink bottled water or water that has been boiled. In Africa, I would boil and treat water with a dissolvable chemical tablet. Can I take something before travelling to stop tummy bugs? There are a number of probiotics and prebiotics on the market and some may decrease  the risk of tummy troubles by up to 70 per cent. But you’re more likely to eventually succumb to traveller’s tummy in certain countries, and the longer you’re away.","A guide on how to avoid getting seriously ill on your holiday abroad .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . A stronger pound and price cuts in foreign resorts are making family trips to European hotspots up to 31 per cent cheaper this summer, says a Post Office Travel Money survey. Best-value holidays are to Spain's Costa del Sol and to Bulgaria, while Italy and France are the most-pricey spots. Travellers were warned that typical holiday items such as buckets and spades, sun cream and insect repellent can be as much as 80 per cent more in some resorts than in others. Family break: A bucket and spade could cost up to 80% more in some beach resorts . Those choosing to eat out will find prices have plunged as much as 46 per cent since last year in some popular destinations. Those places where meals are much cheaper include Sorrento in Italy and the Croatian resort of Porec. However, meal prices have soared in Majorca, making it one of the priciest of places to eat out. Post Office Travel Money surveyed the price of 15 typical holiday-spend items in 13 popular European resorts as well as Orlando in Florida. The items included a three-course family meal, beach items and soft and alcoholic drinks. The best-value resort was Sunny Beach in Bulgaria where the items cost just £66. Best value: Sunny Beach in Bulgaria was voted top for holiday spends including beach items and meals . The next-best prices were in the Costa del Sol where the items were £80 followed by Crete (£87). Despite the dip in meal prices, Sorrento was one of the most expensive of the resorts, with the items costing as much as £143. Only Nice on the French Riviera was more pricey - at £148. A bucket and spade cost just £1.63 in Crete but as much £8.17 in Nice, while a portion of chips was 64p in Sunny Beach but £3.27 in Nice. Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: ‘Paying for meals is likely to have the biggest impact on the family budget. ‘Price variations in popular destinations are much greater than you might expect so those who have still to book would be well advised to do some homework to find out where feeding the family will cost least. ‘For those on a strict budget Sunny Beach and the Costa del Sol look to be unbeatable value. ‘However, competition between restaurants in Sorrento and Porec means that families visiting these resorts will pay a lot less than a year ago.’","Destinations cheaper thanks to strong pound and price cuts .

A drunken passenger managed to sneak on to an empty plane unnoticed before being found in the toilet by cleaners, and claiming to be the co-pilot. The . shocking breach of security happened at Birmingham Airport after the . man entered the airfield at around 1am last Thursday. Lee Jezard, 22, from Evesham, Worcester, arrived at . Birmingham Airport too late to catch his 7.30pm flight to Ibiza for a . lads holiday with five of his friends. Rule-breaker: Twenty-two year old Lee Jezard said he wanted to expose a lapse in airport security . He was re-booked on the first flight out the next morning but didn't have enough money to stay in a hotel so got drunk in an airport bar. He then decided to go downstairs and crawled along the conveyor behind the check-in desks until he ended up on the airfield. Yesterday, Lee, who is a duty manager at The Wood Norton Hotel, said: 'I turned up late so I missed my flight to Ibiza but my bags were already on it because my mates had checked them in. 'They gave me a flight the next morning and I went to the bar and got absolutely slaughtered to be honest. I had one too many. 'I went downstairs and it was quite empty with just a few cleaners around and I thought ""this doesn't look very secure"". 'I wondered if I could expose a lapse in their security and got on the conveyor belt behind the check-in desks. 'I made it through and it looks like a factory back there, it is absolutely massive. 'I got on to the airfield and there was a plane there with steps going up to it and I went up and there was a cleaner in there. Lee Jezard, centre, pictured with friends, said he tried to convince a cleaner on board the aircraft that he was the co-pilot . 'I was trying to convince him I was the co-pilot. He believed it for a minute but then he called police and they arrested me. 'My response after being arrested was I just did it to prove how bad airport security is. 'It's a good job I am not a terrorist. It's funny to my mates but I suppose it isn't funny for the airport. 'I couldn't believe how easily I got through, no-one stopped me or confronted me once between the check-in desk and the airfield. 'They said they would have to shut down the airport and search everywhere. 'The police who arrested me didn't even know what to arrest me on, they had to go and print something off.' A source at the airport said it was one of the most dramatic security breaches they had ever witnessed . Lee was unable to join his pals in Ibiza and is now on a no-fly list until he appears at Birmingham Magistrates Court next month. Speaking about what he found behind the scenes at the airport, he added: 'After you go through the shutters you go up and it is massive. 'There is loads of conveyor belts going off in all different directions but I just went straight. 'It goes up and down and then there was a ladder I got off on and the shutters were all open and I found myself on the airfield. 'I couldn't quite believe what I was doing.' Lee managed to avoid security by climbing though the conveyor belt used for luggage behind the closed check-in desks . Yesterday West Midlands Police confirmed a 22-year-old was arrested at the scene. He has been charged with entering a . security restricted area of an aerodrome without the permission of the . manager and boarding an aircraft without permission. A . source at the airport, who exposed the security breach . blasted bosses and said: 'It is such an incredible breach of security, one of the biggest I have ever heard of at a British airport. 'He could have been a terrorist, he could have been anybody at all. It is scary that this was allowed to happen. 'He could have done anything to that plane or another plane, they must have had to do a lot of checks afterwards. 'The check-in desks would have been closed by that time but the baggage flaps should be locked and secured. 'It is unthinkable that someone managed to climb through there without being spotted on the CCTV cameras. 'You . have seen things abroad where a person has made it on to the airfield . but I have never heard of it happening in Britain. It is terrifying . really.' An Embraer 190 regional airliner operated by Lufthansa taking off from Birmingham International Airport . A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said Mr Jezard was arrested at around 1.10am last Thursday at the airport. She said: 'He was charged later that day with the offence of entering a security restricted area of an aerodrome without the permission of the manager and a separate offence of boarding an aircraft without permission. 'He was released on bail, with conditions not to attend any airport in the UK, and is due to appear before Birmingham Magistrates on 20 August.' A spokesperson for Birmingham Airport, added: 'We can confirm that a man was arrested by West Midlands Police at Birmingham Airport during the early hours of Thursday 17th July and was later charged.' Birmingham Airport had been celebrating on Tuesday morning when the first jet arriving from China touched down following the opening of the airport's £40million runway extension. The 248-seat Airbus A330-200 arrived from Beijing and was the first jet to land on the new lengthened runway. It then took off again a few hours later on the inaugural Birmingham to Beijing flight - becoming the only direct air link between China and a UK destination outside London.","Lee Jezard, 22, missed his flight to Ibiza so got drunk in an airport bar .

But things feel rather more free-form . when you stand at the top of the SCAD Tower – a terrifying ride at the . Tivoli Friheden theme park, in Aarhus, central Denmark. Here, paying customers are suspended in a harness above a 30-metre (100ft) chasm – and then, simply, dropped – without any sort of wire or bungee rope. Instead, they plummet, at speeds of 55mph – before landing in a waiting net below. Am I really going to do this? A rider hangs in suspense as he prepares to drop from the SCAD Tower . Wait for it, mate: A terrifying plunge towards terra firma is just seconds away . Of course, there is nothing unsafe about the attraction – whose name translates as ‘Sky Tower’. But for a tiny passage of time, as they plunge rapidly towards terra firma, riders have nothing to control their motion but the inevitable influence of gravity. Am I really going to do this? This head-cam shot captures the moment just before the harness is released . And we're off: The clasp is released, and the blink-and-you-miss-it descent begins . Certainly, you need plenty of courage to even think about making the jump. Tivoli Friheden warns its guests that they are not allowed to try the SCAD Tower if they suffer from ‘back problems, heart problems, hypertension, epilepsy, fractures, open wounds and fear of heights', or are 'intoxicated by alcohol, medicine or other drugs'. Perhaps obviously, pregnant women are also prohibited from riding. It's a long way down from here, but not long to go: The speed of descent is clearly visible . Down down, deeper and down: The rider heads for the welcome embrace of the net below . The tower stands at a height of 40 metres, offering spectacular views of Aarhus and the surrounding countryside - assuming you have the nerve to take your hands from your face. But there is a get-out clause. Almost there: The rider reaches the end of his rapid encounter with gravity . Safe at last: The rider plummets successfully into the waiting net . Tremulous souls who want enjoy the view, but don’t want to throw themselves into the abyss, can take a lift to the platform, and then return to earth the slow way.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Wardens will issue on-the-spot fines to holidaymakers caught feeding seagulls with scraps of food in a West Country seaside city from next week. Plymouth city council is launching a campaign to tackle the problem of the gulls swooping down on tourists in scenes like something out of the Hitchcock horror film The Birds. It comes after complaints that the seagulls are becoming a growing menace for residents and tourists alike, snatching food out of people's hands. 'Menace': Plymouth is cracking down on tourists who feed seagulls . Posters are beginning to appear around the city centre warning people not to offer food to seagulls. Cafes and restaurants with outside eating areas are being asked to quickly remove empty plates and consider using screens and umbrellas to stop the birds from hanging around the tables. Katie Easter, who owns the Real Food Kitchen in the city centre, said the problem stemmed from tourists feeding the birds. She added: ‘The seagulls remember and then they come back. ‘It would be a huge shame if there were no seagulls, but if they could be a little more civilised that would be great.’ Nigel Eadie, owner of The Original Pasty House, called seagulls are ‘a real menace’. Popular seaside resort: Holidaymakers in Plymouth are being urged not to feed seagulls . He added: ‘They are having a very negative affect on our business, and upon many other local eating establishments throughout the city. ‘It's a real shame because on a fine day the whole ambiance of the city is so adversely influenced by their aggressive behaviour.’ Plymouth council Brian Vincent, cabinet member for the environment, said ‘We've seen a steady rise in the number of gulls and people complaining about their behaviour. ‘These birds should be at sea where they belong and until we remove their breakfast, lunch, tea and snack sources from them they are going to stay here. ‘We are launching this campaign to remind people we all have a part to play in reducing this problem.’ Spot fines: Tourists caught feeding seagulls in Plymouth will be handed penalties . Now other councils across the 'English Riviera' are debating whether to copy Plymouth City Council and crack down on tourists who encourage seagulls to invade resorts by feeding them. Similar complaints have been made across Devon and Cornwall, including popular summer resorts like Newquay, Truro, Falmouth and St Ives. The European Herring Gull is the best known type of gull, and can be seen in seaside areas such as Plymouth all year round. Growing . up to 66cm in length and weighing just over 1.5kg, they are one of . largest and noisiest species of gull, with their loud 'laughing' call . being the most recognisable. Tony Whitehead, from the RSPB in the South West, said the number of gulls in seaside towns was increasing due to the amount of food waste available to them. He added: ‘Gulls are expert scavengers. 'Feeding them or discarding food reinforces their belief that all humans provide an easy food source and reduces their natural wariness of humans.’","Businesses suffering due to 'aggressive' seagulls in Plymouth .

"By . Hugo Duncan . Property hot spots are popping up all over the country as the recovery in house prices spreads beyond London, figures showed yesterday. The average value of a home in Britain rose by 6.5 per cent or £90 a day to £260,488 in the first half of the year, according to the report. Salford in Greater Manchester saw the biggest increase, up 12 per cent to £138,619, but homes there still cost around a quarter of those in London where prices jumped 8.2 per cent to £567,392. The northern town has benefited from major regeneration in recent years including the BBC’s move to Media City UK in 2011. Scroll down for video . The average value of a home in Britain rose by 6.5 per cent or £90 a day to £260,488 in the first half of the year . Around 2,700 BBC staff now work in Salford across 26 departments including BBC Breakfast, BBC Sport and BBC Radio 5 Live. A number of highly-paid executives have moved from London to the region boosting demand for expensive homes. Other towns to see house price gains of close to 12 per cent in the first half of the year include Brough in Yorkshire, St Leonards-On-Sea in East Sussex, Tavistock in Devon and Hunstanton in Norfolk. Lawrence Hall, a spokesman at Zoopla, said: ‘Homeowners up and down the country are starting to see the benefits of the recovery as home values make further headway in 2014. ‘Over the past few years Salford especially has prospered from job creation in the area which has helped boost the local property market. ‘Property price growth has largely been a London and South East story until recently, so it is very encouraging to see the house price recovery broadening and the ripple effect starting to take hold further north.’ Salford has benefited from major regeneration in recent years including the BBC¿s move to Media City UK in 2011 . Rising house prices will be welcomed by owners but will fuel fears that the young are being squeezed out of the property market. The National Association of Estate Agents this week said a tiny 3 per cent of house sales last month were to those aged 18 to 30 down from 12 per cent in August. Many hard-pressed young families are struggling to get on the housing ladder as muted wage growth, soaring prices and tough new mortgage rules are taking their toll. But the Zoopla report showed ‘a few weak spots’ in the market including in Scotland where prices are up just 1.1 per cent to £170,800 ahead of the referendum on Scottish independence in September. ‘Towns on the England-Scotland border are likely suffering from caution amongst buyers ahead of the referendum,’ said Mr Hall. The worst performing tow in the UK was Wadebridge in Cornwall where prices fell 2.1 per cent in the first half of the year to £342,192. The slump meant prices fell by nearly £40 a day in the Cornish town – a far cry from the £236 a day rise seen in London. House prices in Ryton in Tyne and Wear were down 1.9 per cent while they fell 1.6 per cent in Newton-Le-Willows in Merseyside.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Are the Obamas heading for the Golden State when they hand back the keys to 1600 Pennslvania Avenue? According to gossiping realtors in California's Coachella Valley, the President and wife Michelle are buying a $4.25million modern home in a gated community in Rancho Mirage which once counted Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby as residents. The Obamas are believed to be in escrow for the four-bedroom, 4.5-bathroom home which has sweeping hilltop views, a gym, pool, 20ft waterfall and putting green. Fit for a president? Obama and wife Michelle are reportedly in escrow for this $4.25million home in Rancho Mirage, California - although White House have denied reports . The jaw-dropping home has a 20ft-waterfall along with spa areas and a putting course . The multimillion-dollar home is modern in style with four bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms . The hot property news, revealed by the LA Times, has been denied by the White House. It is being sold by Marc Lange and Carl Blea with HOM-Sotheby's international realty. The 8,000-square-foot home, which is nestled in three acres, was built in the early Nineties. Along with the lavish main home, there is a second home, called a 'casita' with three bedrooms and three bathrooms. Other features include a rock lagoon and two spas. The property previously sold ten years ago and was placed on the market at one stage for $12.5million, according to the LA Times. The First Family have spent numerous breaks in California throughout their time in the White House. In February, the President had a golf weekend with his childhood friends at Sunnylands in Rancho Mirage. The Obamas also own a home in Chicago. The California home also has a three-bedroom second property on its grounds called a 'casita' The home, which sits on three acres, over looks the fabulous views of the Coachella Valley . The home comes with a pool, waterfall and spa facilities in southern California and was built in 1993 . A vast family area offers a comfy setting for the potential new buyers to take in California sunsets . The President is currently taking part in a fundraising drive on the West Coast. Obama flies to fundraisers fro Democratic candidates in Seattle and San Fransisco on Tuesday before arriving in Los Angeles on Wednesday. There, he will attend local Democratic National Committee events scheduled for Wednesday night and Thursday and will also appear Thursday at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. President Obama, Michelle and Malia enjoyed a four-day weekend in southern California in June, staying at a private residence inside the gated community of Thunderbird Heights, in Rancho Mirage. Sasha Obama is not believed to have been on the weekend trip, which was expected to include golfing and perhaps some house-hunting for the Obamas, it was reported at the time. Malia Obama has also recently spent time in California where she worked as a runner on the set of Halle Berry's upcoming sci-fi series Extant in Hollywood. The White House has denied rumors from Californian realtors that the Obamas are in escrow over a $4.25million property in the state .","The President and wife Michelle 'are buying a $4.25million modern home in a gated community in Rancho Mirage'

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . With their Model S they conquered the high-end electric car market; with the Model X in 2015 they plan to revolutionise electric SUVs; and now with their Model III Tesla Motors plan to make electric cars mainstream. It’s long been known that Tesla were planning on a more affordable version of their revolutionary electric cars, and now details have been revealed of what to expect. The Model III will go on sale for around £30,000 in the UK and about $35,000 in the U.S. from 2017 according to reports, while it’ll have a range of 200 miles (320 kilometres). Details of California-based Tesla Motors' next electric car have been unveiled. Dubbed the Model 3 it is a more mainstream vehicle that will go on sale in the U.S. for $35,000 in 2017 and £30,000 in the UK at a later date. Pictured is an artist's rendering of how it might look . Details on the Model III were revealed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk in an interview with Auto Express. Currently, . Tesla has about 100 'Supercharger' stations scattered across North . America and Europe that give Model S drivers a free power source when . traveling long distances. The technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes. Tesla . recently opened three Supercharger stations in China and plans to set . up about 200 more around the world, including Japan, by the end of the . year. The all-electric vehicle will be a compact vehicle, about 20 per cent smaller than the Model S. Its pricing will also make it more affordable to the general public. Musk had originally wanted to call the vehicle the Model E but, following action from Ford who wanted that name for themselves, the alternative name was decided upon. That was much to the chagrin of Musk, who had wanted the three Tesla cars to spell out the word ‘sex’ (Model S, Model E and Model X). 'We were going to call it model E for a while and then Ford sued us saying it wanted to use the Model E,’ Musk told Auto Express. ‘I thought this is crazy, Ford’s trying to kill sex! So we’ll have to think of another name.’ Instead the ‘3’ of the new car will be denoted by three vertical lines. The Model III, a mid-sized luxury sedan (rendering shown), will first be unveiled in 2016, a year after the Model X Suv is released in early 2015, and will go on sale in 2017. It is apparently a competitor to compact executive cars like the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class . CEO Elon Musk has revealed the newly dubbed Model III will be 20 per cent smaller than its predecessor, the Model S (pictured), and will have a range of 200 miles (320 kilometres) on one charge . The mid-sized luxury sedan will first be unveiled in 2016, a year after the Model X Suv is released in early 2015, and will go on sale in 2017. It is apparently a competitor to compact executive cars like the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class that have traditionally domianted this area of the market. The project is being headed up by Tesla’s British engineering chief Chris Porritt. Like Tesla’s existing fleet of cars, any owner of a Model 3 will be given access to Tesla’s supercharger stations free of charge. And it will also make use of batteries produced at Tesla’s proposed ‘Gigafactory’, which will help produce half a million cars a year by 2020. There are currently five U.S. states battling to host Tesla’s plant: Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. Tesla hopes to sell 35,000 cars this year in the U.S. and the vehicles will soon also be rolled out in Europe, with countries like the UK to benefit from the supercharger network. In other Tesla news, Musk also revealed the Roadster electric sports car would be given a battery upgrade that would increase its range to 400 miles (640 kilometres).

"By . Harriet Hernando . The only clue that this ordinary-looking van gives to show it’s not just your average Transit is the chimney protruding from the roof. This leads down to a wood burner and into the interior of the former window-glazing van, which a pair of university graduates have converted into a caravan. Former Leeds Metropolitan University students Stuart Humphreys, 24, and Claire Bragg, 25, spent just over £6,000 and two years transforming their second-hand van into what will be their home while they travel around Europe. Hidden world: Claire Bragg, 25, and Stuart Humphreys, 24, spent £6,000 converting this second-hand van into a mobile home . Innocuous: From the outside, the Ford Transit looks like any other van, save for the chimney which leads to a wood burner on the inside . Postal worker Ms Bragg has been granted a sabbatical from her job, while chef Mr Humphreys is taking a break from the kitchens. Ms Bragg said: ‘We really like the freedom of it, we can go wherever we like, do whatever we like, whenever we like.’ There are however some drawbacks to their new life. No toilet means the nearest bush will have to suffice and a bath will depend on local rivers and streams. Dreadlocked Mr Humphreys wasn’t fazed though. He said: ‘I’m a stinky hippy, I barely shower anyway!’ Mr Humphreys, who is 6ft 2ins, will also have to contend with the compact space. Room for three: Mr Humphreys, who is 6ft tall, plans to sleep in the foetal position in the tiny bed . Compact: The inside of the van, which is 1.7 metres by 1.8 metres, contains a bed, kitchen and wood burner . While the van seems to contain all the mod cons, it does not however contain a toilet . Mr Humphreys, 24, and and Ms Bragg, 25, from Leeds, plan to travel in the van around Europe . The living area measures 1.7 metres wide by 1.8 metres. He said: ‘I have to sleep diagonally in the foetal position.’ Starting from scratch with a Ford Transit T300 that belonged to a window-glazing company, the couple spent two years transforming the 2007 van into their dream home. Mr Humphries said: ‘The hardest part was adding the insulation to the van - that took three months alone.’ Mr Humphreys and Ms Bragg insulated their van before installing the rest of the fittings . Stuart Humphreys, 25, pictured inside the van, bought the Ford Transit for £3,500. Two years and £6,020 later he converted it into a dream caravan . Next they installed a bed, an oven, and pine cupboards. A wood burner provides heating on cold nights, while a solar panel on the roof powers electronic devices. The van was fitted out with pine before the fittings like the wood burner (right) were installed . Van - £3,500 . Battery - £100 . Solar Panel – £350 . Battery charger – £100 . Power inverter - £100 . Garage consumer unit - £30 . 12v switches – £20 . 12 LED 50/50 warm white light strips - £50 . Thetford Duplex gas oven/grill - £250 . Smev hob and sink combo - £300 . Water pump – £20 . Insulation – £200 . Wood – £350 . Screws and miscellaneous - £100 . Windows – £300 . Wood burner - £250 . Total - £6,020 . Mr Humphries said: ‘We could plug in a 300 watt amp if we wanted and hold our own mini-festival out of the van.’ But the trip will be far from a holiday, as the couple plan to work on local farms and even forage food to save money. Mr Humphries said: ‘We hope to eat as much food as we can catch and do fruit-picking, or any sort of farm work to supplement our adventure.’ The couple, who have been together for three years, will travel by ferry to Holland, continue on to Germany and Scandinavia, then return through Eastern Europe. Ms Bragg said: ‘We’re planning to follow the sun, spending winter in the warm countries and summer in the cooler countries.’ They have registered their vehicle as a camper van to avoid being charged higher costs on ferries and insurance. Mr Humphries said: ‘We were worried the DVLA would not accept the vehicle as a camper van but they were satisfied with the pictures and changed the log book for us.’ You can follow their adventure on their blog - www.europebyvan.wordpress.com .","Stuart Humphreys, 24, and Claire Bragg, 25, spent two years transforming the van from a second-hand window glazing Transit to a caravan .

"By . Ollie Gillman . and Matt Chorley . Child rapists, kidnappers and perverts caught with child abuse images have been allowed to walk free by the police - because they said they were sorry. Hundreds of sex offenders have been let off the hook because they apologised to their victims and the police for their actions, according to figures obtained by MailOnline. The government is facing calls to halt the use of controversial use of the resolution orders, with MPs demanding to know: 'How on earth has this happened?' Scroll down for video . Hundreds of child abusers have avoided  justice by apologising for their actions (pic posed by model) Figures obtained through Freedom of Information laws reveal people arrested on suspicion of rape, child rape, creating child porn, child abduction and sexually abusing a mental patient escaped prosecution by apologising. The use of community resolution orders or restorative justice has allowed 256,816 crimes to pass without offenders going to court in the last three-and-a-half years. The orders were brought in to allow youths and first-time offenders to avoid a criminal record and get their lives back on track. But there is growing concern that they are now being used for 'the most perverse and sickening crimes'. Shocking figures from 38 of England and Wales' police forces show resolution orders were used in 30 rape cases, including 21 involving children. 20 orders were handed out to people suspected of raping children aged less than 13 (pic posed by model) Another community resolution order was given to a care worker in the West Midlands who caused a mental patient to engage in a penetrative sex act. Five other orders involved kidnap or abduction, 75 were for sexually assaulting young children, and 284 sexual assaults were passed off with an apology. Conservative MP Nick de Bois, who sits on the Commons justice committee, said he would be calling on the Government to review the orders. He said: 'It's shocking that offenders who admit to serious criminal offences are being offered the chance to say sorry and walk away from answering in a court of law for their crimes.' 'The community resolution order was designed for very low-level offences, not for some of the most perverse and sickening crimes. 'I know that victims are meant to give their consent to these orders before they can be implemented but this would be at a time when they may be under the most distressing of circumstances. 'Frankly this is not good enough and just saying ""sorry"" should not even be on option. 'I would expect the Government to review these orders and establish why they have been used for suspected sex crimes. I expect the Government to stamp down on this and ask: ""How on earth has this happened?"".' Thousands of suspects of violent crimes also evaded proper justice, as did scores of cases of theft and criminal damage. At least two cases of bomb hoaxers were let off with an apology. Community resolution orders were introduced so victims could be involved in the justice process. The orders are often used when shoplifters are caught in the act, or to punish youths so they do not get a criminal record. An apology has to be accepted by the victim, and the person who receives the order may have to do some form of community service. Conservative MP Nick de Bois has called for a Government review of community resolution orders . The figures provided by 38 police forces in England and Wales relate to community resolution orders and restorative justice, both of which involve the victim of the crime accepting an apology. Adam Pemberton, Assistant Chief Executive for the charity Victim Support said: . 'Community resolutions are not for serious crimes such as rape or child abuse; they are only supposed to be used for minor offences. 'The priority for victims and witnesses is not only that justice is seen to be done, but that it is seen to work. Victims want to know they will get justice and that a criminal will not commit the same crime again. 'Victims should be put first and their view must be taken into account before a community remedy is used – and only after it has been properly explained to them. They often lack confidence in the practicality, robustness and delivery of community sentences. 'Community resolution should never be used to simply cut corners or save money – else victims may feel like the offender has got away with it.' The Home Office said it was up to Chief Constables to make sure community resolution orders are used in the right circumstances. A spokesman said: 'We always expect criminals to be prosecuted and punished in accordance with the law. 'Serious crimes will continue to be progressed through the courts, where they will be met with tough sentences. In particular, conviction rates for violence against women and girls are at their highest-ever levels and sentences for rapists are longer. 'However, community resolutions can be used for some crimes where the victim does not want the police to take more formal action. They are also often used in cases of young offenders to help them face up to the impact of their behaviour. 'Chief Constables are responsible for making sure they are only used in appropriate circumstances.' A spokeswoman for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: 'Community resolutions are in the main used to deal with less serious cases, however, at times it may be necessary and appropriate to use them to deal with more serious cases. 'The guidance is very clear that community resolutions should only be used if the offender accepts responsibility, the resolution reflects the views and wishes of the victim and there is no history of previous offending. 'Community resolutions can be used when the victim does not want to take more formal action and they are also often used in cases of young offenders where criminalisation is not seen as a proportionate response in the best interests of the victim and the offender.' Last month Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the use of the community resolutions in domestic violence cases. Data from 15 police forces showed that 3,305 of the resolutions were used last year – up from 1,337 in 2009. She said in a speech: 'Community resolutions can be very effective for things like anti-social behaviour. But they shouldn't be used for violent offences, and especially not for domestic violence. That is why Labour is committed to banning their use for domestic and sexual violence.'","Hundreds of sex offenders let off with community resolution orders .

The cops were also suspicious because . the singer's car doesn't have a license plate, but only a custom 'RJ' frame. Singer Ray J told LAPD cops that he was just trying to connect his bluetooth headset when he was pulled over this week. He was released with a warning and even posed for pictures with the cops . Ray J, 33, who is infamous for starring in the sex tape that propelled Kim Kardashian to stardom, told the cops he was just having problems connecting his bluetooth headset. The two LAPD officers warned him to not to text while driving — but then asked him to step out of the Bentley. Ray J panicked, he told TMZ. But it t turns out the cops just wanted to take pictures with the singer. He agreed and later asked them to take a few with his phone.

"By . Richard Spillett . A company boss has slammed the government's Jobsmatch service after his ad for a personal assistant who could 'speak excellent English' was queried because it could breach the Equality Act. Paul Scully, who runs a communications firm called Nudge Factory based in Croydon, south London, said he tried to place the ad on the government's Universal Jobsmatch website last week. But rather than the job being listed on the site - which has hundreds of thousands of jobs around the UK - Mr Scully received a response questioning his requirement. Communications firm boss Paul Scully has been left angry by claims by a government-run website that his requirement a PA 'speak excellent English' could breach the Equality Act . After he asked for an ad stating that the successful candidate should 'speak excellent English', he was sent an email asking 'why the applicant needed to speak a particular language'. The site - run on behalf of the DWP - said a 'justification' would be needed for exempting the ad from the Equality Act 2010, passed to protect against discrimination. Mr Scully said he was 'stunned' by their query, which he branded 'a ridiculous example of politically correct red tape'. He said: 'We want a personal assistant and said in the advert we wanted someone with good communication skills, experience as a PA and that they speak excellent English. 'When I heard back from Universal Jobsmatch they told me that in order to comply with the Equality Act I would need to explain why the successful candidate would need a good command of English. 'It's political correctness at its worst - there are thousands of small businesses out there who would benefit from this site, but if they are met with these sorts of questions and barriers it's not really worth the effort.' The Department of Work and Pensions has admitted its checks may have been too strict in this case . Mr Scully has now withdrawn the ad from Universal Jobsmatch and is advertising elsewhere for the £18,000-£24,000 job. The Equality Act is designed to stop employers discriminating against age, race, disability, religion and gender - but does not specify language. A spokesman for the DWP admitted that checks may have 'been too strict'. The Universal Jobsmatch website has come under fire for a series of blunders in the past. Among the jobs listed on the site previously was an ad for a hitman for MI6, which stated that an 'MI6 target elimination specialist' was needed. Other ads included 'international couriers' for CosaNostra Holdings, also known as the Sicilian Mafia, as well as listings from pornographic websites. The jobs website - which replaced Jobcentre Plus - has also been slated for hundreds of thousands of repeat or fake job ads. He said: 'Universal Jobmatch is successfully helping people into work with around half a million employers now registered. 'We have robust procedures in place to ensure that vacancies comply with equality legislation and that jobseekers are not discriminated against. 'In this case, those checks may have been too strict and we are now reviewing our procedures.' The Universal Jobsmatch website, launched in 2012, aims to match jobs with jobseekers on a 'free job posting and matching service'. The site, set up by jobs firm Monster at a cost to the DWP of £17m - and which costs £6m-a-year to run - has been criticised in the past after advertising for fake jobs.","Paul Scully applied to advertise for PA who 'speaks excellent English'

Kathryn McDonough, who is serving a prison sentence for lying to investigators about the teenager's disappearance and death, took the stand on Tuesday in Seth Mazzaglia's first-degree murder trial. Mazzaglia, 31, is accused of raping and killing University of New Hampshire student Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott of Westborough, Massachusetts, in 2012 after she rebuffed his sexual advances. Prosecutors began questioning McDonough on Tuesday by asking her point-blank who killed Marriott and she answered: 'Seth Mazzaglia.' Scroll down for video . Testimony: Kathryn McDonough looks towards her former boyfriend, Seth Mazzaglia, as she testified in his murder trial on Tuesday. She told the court that she had watched him kill a student in 2012 . When asked how, she replied: 'He strangled her with a rope.' When asked how she knew that, she replied: 'I was there.' She explained she had taken Marriott to their apartment in Dover because Mazzaglia had demanded she find him a sex partner as punishment for leaving him alone for 12 days while she went to camp. She said she felt she had no 'option' but to take over the young student she had befriended during their job at a nearby mall. McDonough . said he had brutally sodomized her a month earlier as 'punishment' for . failing to find him a sex 'slave' so she was willing to 'try and please . him' however she could. 'I . think it would be fitting if the first thing you saw me do when you got . back is pleasure one of your friends until they died of orgasms and only . then turned my brutal attention to you,' Mazzaglia allegedly wrote in a . text message he sent to McDonough. She added that Mazzaglia wanted her to recruit Marriott as the slave because of her physique and personality, SeaCoastOnline reported. Accused: Seth Mazzaglia, left, allegedly raped and killed Lizzi Marriott, right, when she rebuffed his advances . McDonough is expected to detail the attack during testimony on Wednesday. Mazzaglia's . lawyer told jurors McDonough killed Marriott during rough sex with . restraints. They say he helped dispose of the body and initially took . blame out of his obsessive love for McDonough. But . last week Assistant Attorney General Peter Hinckley told the jury that . after Marriott could no longer object to Mazzaglia's advances because of . the choking, he pushed her underwear out of the way and raped her while . McDonough did nothing to help. McDonough, 20, is the key witness against her ex and lawyers on both sides cast her differently. Prosecutors . portray her as the sexual submissive, dominated in all aspects of their . relationship by a man 10 years older than her, but Mazzaglia's lawyers . say she was the dominatrix, a woman obsessed with finding another woman . to dominate, and it was Mazzaglia who was her sexual slave. On one thing both sides agree: McDonough watched Marriott die. On trial: Mazzaglia, pictured in court last week, initially claimed that he murdered Marriott to cover for McDonough, whom he was obsessed with at the time, his lawyers have claimed . McDonough was 17 when she met Mazzaglia at tryouts for a theater production. She moved into his Dover apartment when she turned 18, during her senior year. It was Oct. 9, 2012 - mere months after she graduated from high school - when Marriott died in their Dover apartment. Marriott had transferred to the University of New Hampshire only weeks earlier to major in marine biology. She was a commuter student, living with her aunt and uncle in Chester during the week and returning home to Westborough most weekends. Marriott had been in a committed relationship with Brittany Atwood, who lived in Massachusetts. Marriott met McDonough at a department store near the UNH campus where they both worked. On the night she died, Marriot text messaged Atwood minutes before 9pm to let her know she was going over to 'Kat's' to watch a movie. Atwood testified she was happy for her because she was finally making new friends. Locked up: McDonough, pictured Tuesday, is serving a prison sentence for lying about the teen's death . Sick: McDonough, pictured as she is escorted out of the courtroom during the morning break in her former boyfriend's trial, told the court that she watched as the 19-year-old was strangled with a rope . The text message was Marriott's last communication. Atwood testified that she had sent Marriott two text messages - one at 8.59pm and one at 9.06pm - but Marriott never responded. Atwood said became worried the next morning when she had not heard from Marriott and contacted her parents. Mazzaglia told investigators he and McDonough had used Marriott's 2001 Mazda to take her body to Peirce Island in Portsmouth, where they threw it and her cellphone into the Piscataqua River. The pair then drove Marriott's car to UNH, left it in a student lot and discarded her belongings in trash bins, authorities allege. McDonough is serving a 1-1/2 to three-year sentence for conspiracy and hindering prosecution. Missed: Marriott, pictured left and right with her parents, had gone to McDonough's house to watch a movie . Defense attorney Joachim Barth told jurors during his opening statement that McDonough bargained her concocted story of what happened that night in exchange for time off her sentence, and that testifying against Mazzaglia is part of her plea deal. Bob Marriott, the victim's father, said at her sentencing last July that the family grudgingly accepted the plea deal to further the prosecution of Mazzaglia. Family members describe Marriott as 'gullible' - someone who easily could be taken advantage of because of her trusting nature. One family friend from Westborough, Massachusetts, where Marriott grew up, called her naive. 'She . was just a good girl. That's probably what got her in trouble,' Dawn . Downey said. 'She was too trusting and she was beautiful. Those two . things will kill you.'","Kathryn McDonough, 20, testified on Tuesday that she watched Seth Mazzaglia, 31, strangle Lizzi Marriott with a rope in 2012 .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . and Chris Hastings . A grieving mother entrapped a ‘heartless’ thief who stole tributes from the grave of her murdered son by placing a tracking device inside  a teddy bear. Heartbroken Joan Holland was so determined to discover who was stealing the items from her son Andrew’s final resting place that she bought a £200 GPS device and stitched it inside the toy. Andrew was stabbed to death during a row outside a takeaway when he was 16 in 2007. Scroll down for video . Grieving: Joan Holland, 50, caught a thief who was stealing from her murdered son's grave by hiding a tracker inside a teddy bear. Above, Ms Holland at the grave of her son Andrew, who was stabbed to death in 2007 . Mrs Holland noticed that objects would . be missing during her visits to his grave at  St Michael’s churchyard . near Bolton in Greater Manchester. She . said: ‘I’d thought about putting a camera over the grave, but someone . suggested a tracker. When it went off by sending an alert to my . daughter- in-law’s laptop, we knew the teddy had been stolen from the . grave.’ Mrs Holland, who . traced the bear  to the home of the thief, Andrew Balshaw, said she saw . items from other people’s graves, such as a wreath and ornaments, in his . bin. After his arrest, . Balshaw, 48, initially claimed he had bought the teddy and found the . other items, but later pleaded guilty to theft and possessing a small . amount of cannabis. Caught: Ms Holland hid a £200 tracker inside this teddy (left), before placing it on the grave in a bid to catch the culprit. The following day, she used GPS to track the stolen item down to the flat of Anthony Balshaw (right) Bolton . Crown Court was told that he had been attacked by other prisoners who . had discovered the nature of his crime while he was on remand. Described as ‘callous and heartless’ by the judge in the case, Jeremy Lasker, he was jailed for 12 months. Mrs Holland wept as sentence was passed and described the devastating effects the thefts had had on her. She . said: ‘Since Andrew died, the only comfort I have gained is by going to . the graveside. I feel so angry someone would take items from his . grave.’ Lindsay Thomas, prosecuting, told the court Ms Holland's son Martin, 31, had bought the tracker after they arrived at Andrew's gravestone on Mother's Day this year to find it completely empty. 'Clever plan': Today, Ms Holland (pictured with the tracking device), who works as a carer, said she has visited her son's grave every Sunday for the past seven years and was devastated when items started to go missing . They stitched the device into the teddy bear, before leaving it on the grave in St Michael's churchyard in Bolton at around 3pm on April 18. They were alerted to the bear's theft at around 5pm the next day and called the police, she said. Officers described Balshaw's flat at as 'Aladdin's cave' filled with a number of missing items, including a porcelain doll and an angel that had vanished from Andrew's grave months earlier. During a police interview, Balshaw initially claimed he had bought the teddy and found the other items, before later confessing to theft and possessing a small amount of cannabis. At the time Balshaw stole the toy, he was already on bail over the theft of a bicycle, the court heard. Recorder Jeremy Lasker yesterday described the Holland family's actions as clever and astute, while deeming the crime 'heartless and callous'. 'The public would be outraged if I did not pass a sentence of imprisonment on you,' he said. 'There is no doubt that this family have suffered severely by what you have done. Court case: Yesterday, Balshaw was jailed for 12 months at Bolton Crown Court after pleading guilty to theft . 'There is nothing I can say in passing sentence on you that is likely to assuage the grief or upset of the victims.' Andrew Holland was stabbed to death outside Ashys takeaway in Plodder Lane, Farnworth, on August 17, 2007. Ms Holland added: 'At least now we have had some justice.'","Joan Holland, 50, noticed items going missing from son Andrew's grave .

Ms Hudson said she knew something was wrong on the morning of October 24, 2008, when she couldn't reach her mother - whom she spoke to daily - according to documents filed by prosecutors last week. Harrowing: Jennifer Hudson poses with her Oscar in 2008 and brother-in-law William Balfour. She's expected to testify at his murder trial over the shootings of her mother, brother and nephew .

"By . Associated Press . A Washington man accused of plowing his souped-up truck through a crowd of bar-goers, killing a man, insists to police that he only had one beer beforehand — but his truck was taken over by demons and took him on an 'amusement ride from hell.' Dustin F. Brown, 28, told cops that he desperately wanted to stop his Ford F-350 as it fishtailed out of control on May 26 while people in Bellingham left downtown bars. Four pedestrians were hit. One, Dragan Skrobonja, 37, was killed. Brown, whose blood-alcohol content was three times the legal limit, told cops the truck was 'literally possessed.' 'I was along for the ride,' Brown told a detective hours after the accident, according to investigative records released to The Bellingham Herald under a public records request. 'I . was bleeding everywhere, and my glasses — I couldn't really see, I was . just on a terrible — an amusement ride from hell, pretty much.' Charged: Dustin F. Brown, 28, is accused of drunkenly crashing into four people leaving the bars in Bellingham, Washington . VIctim: Dragan Skrobonja, 37, was one of the four people struck by Brown's truck, and the only one to have died following the May crash . Ride from Hell: Brown told cops that his souped-up truck (pictured) was 'literally possessed' when he struck four people, killing one . Brown insisted he was being honest, and told police he desperately wanted to stop but the throttle had stuck. In the aftermath of the accident, a . crowd surrounded the truck and pulled the driver out, detaining him as . officers arrived, police said. Many people had been out celebrating the . city's annual Ski to Sea race, a seven-sport relay race that covers 93 . miles from Mount Baker to Bellingham Bay. Brown . faces nine felony charges of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault. Hours before the accident, police say, he sent a series of text messages to friends saying he was too drunk to drive. The records say Brown had been drinking . at the Up & Up tavern in Bellingham, about 20 miles south of the Canadian border, when he contacted two friends . searching for a place to stay. 'So I'm downtown and shouldnt drive,' Brown wrote one at 9:36pm. 'Wanna volunteer to house me?' 'Shoot can't help you senor,' she answered. He texted her again just after 10pm: 'Im never lookin for help ... Except now... But ok.' Friends and family set up a memorial for victim Dragan Skrobonja at the site of the crash downtown Bellingham . Thirty seconds later Brown texted the second, saying he was intoxicated and 'dont wanna drive home.' 'I'm headed down to Bellevue now,' she replied. 'Otherwise I would invite you to crash at my place.' Instead, witnesses said, Brown continued drinking and buying pitchers of beer for others. One, Jeremy Evans, 25, said Brown seemed extremely intoxicated and spilled beer as he poured it into his glass. In an interview at a hospital three hours after the crash, Detective Pauline Renick asked Brown if he had been drinking. 'I had a few drinks,' he said, at first, according to a transcript. But when pressed for details, Brown's recollection changed. He insisted he'd only had one pint. He explained how he bought a pitcher, poured one glass for himself and gave the rest to two girls he'd just met. Brown drank no other alcohol, he said, before getting into his truck at 1:30 am. Brown remains in Whatcom County Jail, charged with vehicular homicide and vehicular assault . The detective said that didn't jibe with the results of his breath test, and that he still smelled of alcohol. A mechanic consulted by police reported that it wasn't possible for the throttle to stick the way Brown described and that the accelerator worked fine. One witness, Tyler Dixon, told police that toward the end of the truck's rampage, it hit two more parked cars and went into reverse and then drive again. Dixon said he took advantage of the pause to jump onto the truck's step bar, grab the driver through the window and pummel him. The driver slumped to the side, and the truck stopped against the barrier. Dixon suffered a fractured knuckle. Brown, 28, remains in Whatcom County Jail on $500,000 bail. Brown's next court hearing has been set for Sept. 10, with a tentative trial date of Sept. 22. His public defender, Darrin Hall, said Skrobonja's death has been difficult for everybody, including Brown. 'It haunts him every day,' Hall said, 'because people's lives are ruined when lives are lost.' Victim Dragan Skrobonja was leaving the bars with a few friends when he was struck and killed by Brown's out-of-control truck, cops say .","Dustin F.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Great-grandfather Ruben Dace warned police of the V2 missile after watching falling just off the coast of East Anglia . They killed thousands in the final months of the Second World War, fired from occupied Europe at the cities and ports of the south-east. So when great-grandfather Reuben Day, 82, saw one of Hitler's terrifying V-2 rockets falling just off the coast of East Anglia he informed the police straight away. But despite Mr Day, then a teenage fishermen, showing police the unexploded rocket lying in the mud - it remained there largely undisturbed for 68 years. Over the years the deadly missile has . only been approached by the occasional sailor using the 2ft of metal . which protruded from the mudflats at low tide to moor their boats. And only now has it been decided that the rocket, one of nearly 1,500 fired at Britain, should be made safe. Mr Day said: 'I have always maintained that it was just the propellant that must have exploded. 'If it had been the warhead, the whole thing would have blown to smithereens and there would have been nothing left.' A . six-man team of Royal Navy bomb disposal experts are working urgently . to make sure the rusting weapon’s one-ton warhead won’t detonate. It is the first time that a V-2, which flew at speeds of over a mile a second, has been found in such good condition in the UK. The missile is thought to have been fired at the port of Harwich in Essex, in October 1944. But instead of hitting its target, the 46ft-long rocket plopped nose down into mudflats about 600ft off the shore. Mr Day's faded notes include 'it was a german rocket,' and 'fell over in mud.' 'But although the police knew about it at the time, I heard nothing more about it and it has stayed there ever since,' he said . Just visible between the two men in the middle of the picture, tthe V2 rocket has remained in the mud 'like a garden ornament' for nearly 70 years . Deadly: For 68 years the missile has remained largely undisturbed, but today a Navy Bomb disposal squad examined the remains of a World War 2 V2 German rocket found in the sea off Harwich, Essex . It left only 2ft of its tail visible . at low tide. The Navy’s bomb squad was called in following a chance . conversation at the nearby Harwich and Dovercourt Sailing Club. Mr Day had been working as a young fisherman and had gone to pick up some fish when he heard a 'terrific explosion' overhead. When he thought there was no longer a . risk of flying shrapnel, he went outside and saw two clouds of black . and white smoke and a white vapour trail coming out of the sky. Father-of-seven Mr Day added: 'I then . heard a whooshing sound like a tube train and found out this rocket had . landed. A fisherman who was in a boat was nearly swamped by it. 'I took a policeman out in a boat to . investigate the next day, but he fell backwards into the mud and I had . to drag him out and recover his boots. Hidden: The missile is thought to have been fired at the port of Harwich in Essex, in October 1944. But instead of hitting its target, the 46ft-long rocket plopped nose down into mudflats about 600ft off the shore . Operation: Only now has it been decided that the rocket, one of nearly 1,500 fired at Britain, should be made safe . Timing: A six-man team of Royal Navy bomb disposal experts are working urgently to make sure the rusting weapon's one-ton warhead won't detonate . 'Later I took his notebook and pencil . and went out on my own to sketch it. I could see the tube of the rocket . and three brass dials inside. I also drew a copy for myself. 'But although the police knew about it at the time, I heard nothing more about it and it has stayed there ever since.' The position of the missile was last . night marked by a large yellow buoy put in place by the Royal Navy, . close to the Harwich and Dovercourt Sailing Club which was established . in 1927 . Club members have been happily . negotiating their dinghies around the missile on the way to their yachts . moored in the river, ever since the war. Powerful weapon: A V2 rocket in process of elevation to the vertical firing position. Weighing almost 14 tons, the missile was launched vertically and could travel at over 3,500mph to strike targets 200 miles away . Destructive:  The V-2 attacks resulted in the deaths of around 7,250 British military personnel and civilians . Desperate attack: The onslaught of 1,400 V-2 rockets - and 10,000 V-1 flying bombs - against London between June 1944 and March 1945 was seen as Hitler's last throw of the dice . Mr Day's son Robert, the commodore . for six years, said: 'It has been common knowledge that it has been . there for years. It is a bit like an ornament in the garden. 'People have never really worried . about it. Over the years some people might have bumped their boats into . it. I just thought that it was an obstruction in the river which needed . to be dealt with. 'We don't know if it has any explosive in it. The warhead could have broken away and might be buried elsewhere.' Local . sailors have known about the rocket’s location for decades but when it . was mentioned at a meeting of harbour users on Tuesday evening, local . police decided something had to be done. Lieutenant . Dan Herridge, the commander of the Navy’s Southern Diving Unit 2, based . in Portsmouth, said his team was trying to assess the danger. However, . they can only work for about a two hours at low tide. So far a few more . feet of the rocket have been exposed but it is unclear if the warhead . is still live. They . have been joined by experts from 33 Regiment Royal Engineers who may . have to use excavation equipment to get the V-2 out of the mud. Wreckage: People gather around to help those trapped in the splintered wreckage of the Smithfield Fish Market in London, after a V-bomb strike killing 115 people . If it is still thought to be volatile, the bomb disposal team will carry out a controlled explosion at sea. Lieutenant Herridge, 30, said: ‘It is . unique. I don’t think a V-2 has been discovered since the end of the . Second World War, certainly not in such good condition. ‘Our guys have never seen anything like this before and probably never will again. It’s a very unusual beast indeed.’ ‘Even . though it has been rusting under the tides for more than 65 years, we . don’t know what explosive content it has so we must deal with it . cautiously and with respect.’ A Royal Navy spokesman said: ‘At first we were sceptical that it was a V-2 because these missiles came down at three times the speed of sound and normally there’s nothing left of them. It is an extraordinary find.’ Essex Police said it was too early to decide whether thousands of people in Harwich would need to be evacuated from their homes. One yachtsman, who did not want to be named, said: ‘We have been sailing our boats around that stretch of water for years and not had any problems. But if it is still live, then the whole town will have to evacuated which will cause chaos.' The onslaught of 1,400 V-2 rockets - and 10,000 V-1 flying bombs - against London between June 1944 and March 1945 was seen as Hitler’s last throw of the dice. The V-2 attacks resulted in the deaths of around 7,250 British military personnel and civilians. A scientific reconstruction carried out in 2010 demonstrated that the V-2 created a crater 60-ft wide and 16-ft deep, throwing up around 3,000 tonnes of rubble into the air. The V-2 was an extremely advanced . piece of technology, and the scientists and engineers responsible for it . went on to play key roles in the post-war space programmes of the . United States and Soviet Union. However, . the V-2 was enormously expensive to produce at a time when the German . Army desperately needed cheap and effective weapons that could be . manufactured en masse. However it was faster, and capable of much greater distances. It also did not need a specialist ramp for launch other than a solid surface. The liquid-propelled V-2 rocket was . developed by German scientists as an effective way of hitting Allied . targets from long distance. It was the world’s first long-range . combat-ballistic missile. Weighing almost 14 tons, the missile was launched vertically and could travel at over 3,500mph to strike targets 200 miles away.",A six-man team of Royal Navy bomb disposal experts are working urgently to make sure the rusting weapon's one-ton warhead won’t detonate .

The 31-year-old Chelsea captain claimed the FA made his position ‘untenable’ ahead of today's hearing over the well-known incident involving Anton Ferdinand of Queens Park Rangers. Terry, who made his international debut in 2003 and appeared for England on 78 occasions, was twice stripped of the captaincy for off-field reasons and said his decision ‘breaks my heart’. Scroll down for video . Former England football captain Terry leaves the headquarters of the FA at Wembley Stadium this afternoon . Queen's Park Rangers' English defender Anton Ferdinand leaves Wembley Stadium in a black suit and tie . He said in an emotional statement: ‘I . am today announcing my retirement from international football. I would . like to thank the England managers who have selected me for my 78 caps. ‘I . have had great pleasure in sharing that honour with all the players . that I've played with. I would like to thank them, the fans and my . family for their support and encouragement during my international . career. ‘Representing . and captaining my country is what I dreamed of as a boy and it has been . a truly great honour. I have always given my all and it breaks my heart . to make this decision. Waving goodbye: Former England captain John Terry, pictured in 2009, has retired from international football . ‘I want to wish (England manager) Roy (Hodgson) and the team every success for the future. ‘I am making this statement today in advance of the hearing of the FA disciplinary charge because I feel the FA, in pursuing charges against me where I have already been cleared in a court of law, have made my position with the national team untenable. ‘I now look forward to playing for . Chelsea FC, and challenging for domestic and European honours, and I . want to thank the fans and the club for their continued support.’ Feud: Queens Park Rangers' Anton Ferdinand, left, is marked by Chelsea's John Terry earlier this month . 'Representing and captaining my country is what I dreamed of as a boy and it has been a truly great honour. I have always given my all and it breaks my heart to make this decision' John Terry . His decision leaves Hodgson with a selection headache heading into next month's World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Poland. Terry has a very colourful history as a footballer. He was one of four players fined two weeks' wages by Chelsea in 2001 after their behaviour at a London Heathrow Airport hotel was criticised on the day after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. One year later Terry and Chelsea team-mate Jody Morris were cleared on a charge of assault and affray in connection with a nightclub incident. Unhappy: The 31-year-old Chelsea captain accused the FA of making his position 'untenable' Terry, uncapped at the time, was ruled out of the World Cup after the FA decided he should not be considered for international duty with England until the legal case is completed. 'I feel the FA, in pursuing charges against me where I have already been cleared in a court of law, have made my position with the national team untenable' John Terry . In November 2006 he was charged with improper conduct by the FA for comments about referee Graham Poll. He later admitted the charge, and was reprimanded and fined £10,000. In December 2009 Chelsea defended Terry after allegations he took secret cash payments to lay on a behind-the-scenes tour of the club's training ground. In January 2010 he was named as the sportsman behind a gagging injunction over his private life. Hearing: Chelsea defender John Terry departs Westminster Magistrates Court after he was cleared of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand on July 13 . A court order had previously been in place, covering an alleged relationship between married Terry and French model Vanessa Perroncel - a former partner of teammate Wayne Bridge. 'I would like to thank the England managers who have selected me for my 78 caps. I have had great pleasure in sharing that honour with all the players that I've played with' John Terry . One month later he was axed as England captain following a meeting with then-manager Fabio Capello. In the same month Bridge refused to shake his hand before Chelsea's match with Manchester City. But in March 2011 he was restored to the role of permanent England captain by Capello. Last October he released a statement denying he made a racist slur against Anton Ferdinand during Chelsea's defeat at QPR after videos had circulated on the internet.

Terry, uncapped at the time, is ruled out of the World Cup after the Football Association decide he should not be considered for international duty with England until the legal case is completed. 2003: June 3 - Makes England debut as substitute against Serbia and Montenegro. 2005: A tabloid newspaper told how Bridge allowed Terry to use his house to have sex with a secretary when he wasn't there. Afterwards, Terry apologised for his transgression and vowed that it would be the last. 2006: August 10 - Chosen to replace David Beckham as England captain by head coach Steve McClaren. November 30 - Charged with improper conduct by FA for comments about referee Graham Poll. Later admits charge and is reprimanded and fined £10,000.

December 21 - The Crown Prosecution Service announce Terry will be charged with racially abusing Ferdinand and is due to appear before West London Magistrates' Court on February 1, 2012. 2012: February 3 - Terry is stripped of the England captaincy for a second time. The decision was taken by members of the 14-strong FA board, without consulting Capello. February 8 - Capello resigns as England manager two days after criticising the decision to strip Terry of the captaincy. July 13 - Cleared at Westminster Magistrates' Court of making a racist insult to Anton Ferdinand during Chelsea's match against QPR in October last year. July 27 - Charged by the FA with using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards QPR defender Ferdinand. It is further alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand. Terry denies the charge and requests a personal hearing. September 23 - Announces his retirement from international football, shortly before the start of his personal hearing to answer the FA charge. But Scotland Yard said they were assessing allegations of racist abuse by Terry after a complaint from the member of the public. Police later confirmed they had launched a formal investigation. 'Whatever you think about John Terry, he . always gave his absolute all on the field for England. A strong leader . and great defender' Gary Lineker, former England striker . In this February, Terry was stripped of the England captaincy for a second time after he was ordered to stand trial for racially abusing Ferdinand in July, after the Euro 2012 tournament had finished. But Capello resigned as England manager two days after criticising the decision to strip Terry of the captaincy by members of the 14-strong FA board, without consulting him. Terry was cleared at court of making a racist insult to Ferdinand, but later charged by the FA with using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards him. Terry denies the charge. Former England striker Gary Lineker tweeted tonight: 'Whatever you think about John Terry, he always gave his absolute all on the field for England. A strong leader and great defender.' Last night the FA were not willing to comment on the news. John Terry, facing a much lower burden of proof, must attempt to clear his name one final time. Argument: Anton Ferdinand (left) and John Terry . His delegation will be led by George Carter-Stephenson QC - who successfully defended the player in court - and are said to be ready to argue that his acquittal in a criminal trial means the FA case cannot proceed. That would involved citing FA rule 6.8, which governs disciplinary hearings and states that the results of relevant civil or criminal proceedings are 'presumed to be correct and the facts presumed to be true' by FA commissions. The FA will doubtless insist their charge against Terry is distinct from the racially-aggravated public order offence from which he was cleared in July. Terry admitted in court saying ""f****** black c***"" but claimed it was used as part of a denial after he believed Ferdinand had accused him of using those words. The panel who handed Liverpool striker Luiz Suarez an eight-match ban when they found him guilty of racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra last season declared simply using racist language was enough to constitute a breach of FA rules.

"By . Steve Nolan . An unemployed and homeless man beat his sister-in-law with a dumbbell bar and cut her throat leaving her to bleed to death in the arms of her young children - out of shame at his lack of 'status' in the community. Foyez Ahmed, 31, flew into a rage and beat 38-year-old Razu Khan before slashing her throat with a kitchen knife, severing her wind pipe and blood vessels, and fleeing the family home. He was starting a life sentence in jail today, ordered to serve a minimum 22 year prison term at Manchester Crown Court after pleading guilty to murder. Sentenced: Foyez Ahmed, left, was given a life sentence for murdering sister-in-law Razu Khan at her Oldham, Greater Manchester home in June . Bangladeshi Ahmed, who had no job, no money, no home and no prospect of marriage, had tried to 'calm himself down' by consulting the Koran, but 'lost it' after believing that Mrs Khan had laughed at him. Three of Mrs Khan's four children and her 13-year-old niece were upstairs when Ahmed attacked her and were alerted to what had happened by her screams. Her 13-year-old daughter held her hand as she lay dying on the sofa while her 17-year-old son tried in vain to revive her. She died in hospital from her injuries. When police caught up with Ahmed, he told them: 'I’m not a proper murderer, I haven’t done it before, this is the first time. I don’t know what I did but I now realise I made a serious mistake.' Ahmed had been lodging at the home of his brother Mohammed Rahman, 53, a successful restaurant owner, and his wife of 20 years Razu in Oldham, Greater Manchester, when he attacked Mrs Khan during the school half term holidays on June 8 . Ahmed had arrived in the UK with a work permit in 2004 and had been casually employed at the family restaurant in Cheshire. He felt he had been 'poorly treated' by his brother and sister-in-law, despite Mr Rahman giving him food and shelter. He became 'frustrated with the predicament of having no job and being unable to leave the family home and return to Bangladesh,' the court heard. The night before the murder he felt 'increased frustration' and turned to his Koran in an effort to calm himself. Murder scene: Police outside the home of Razu Khan where she was killed by her brother-in-law Foyez Ahmed . But the following morning while talking with Razu he 'lost it.' Prosecutor Mr Peter Wright QC said: 'She laughed and he had perceived that she was laughing at him and he said that was the final straw.' Ahmed stormed up to his bedroom and was seen by the children angrily going back downstairs with the dumbbell bar in his hand with the weights removed. He then grabbed the carving knife from the kitchen drawer. At the time three of Razu’s children, a 17-year-old boy and two girls aged 10 and 13, were upstairs along with her 13-year-old niece. Mr Wright added: 'They heard repeated bangs from downstairs and looked out of the window and saw the defendant who acknowledged them at the window and he was appearing to use his mobile phone. 'The 10-year-old daughter went to investigate and found her mother in the lounge with the dumbbell and knife lying nearby. She called for her sister who touched her mother’s hand. 'They were extremely distressed and called for their brother who raised the alarm and tried to assist his mother. He realised she was fatally injured yet continued to perform chest compressions but to no avail.' Devastated: The family of Razu Khan pictured outside Manchester Crown Court . Ahmed rang police to admit he had killed his sister-in-law then rang his brother to confess. Mr Rahman immediately called the house and spoke to his 17-year old son but the youngster would not tell his father the full extent of Razu’s injuries for fear of his father racing back too quickly from his restaurant. Tests revealed Razu’s wind pipe and major blood vessels were severed. Defending Ahmed, John Wishart said: 'It was an act of total frustration. 'He had no job, no money, nowhere to live. Because of his lack of status in the community, there was no prospect of a wife. He told the police of ""the hopelessness of his situation"".' Sentencing Ahmed, Judge Andrew Gilbart QC said: 'Your act has robbed Razu’s family of her love, affection and company. 'For them to live with the knowledge that their wife, or mother or child has been murdered is bad enough but to live with the knowledge that it was at the hands of a close family member is even worse. 'You inflicted terrible and savage injuries upon her in her own house and you must have realised her children would find her. 'You have always accepted responsibility for what you did but I do not accept that the stresses and strains of you living in your brother’s house can amount to any mitigation of this dreadful attack on your sister-in-law.' Speaking after court, Razu’s sister, Aleya Khanum said: 'It has been emotional for the whole family. If he was sentenced abroad then they believe in capital punishment. 'This sentence will not bring back my sister, a daughter or mother back no matter how many years you give him. There are no amount of years which will give that back.' Det Chief Insp Phil Reade of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Only Ahmed knows why he carried out this horrific killing, taking away a wife from his brother and the mother of three children. 'They will be scarred by the devastating events of that day, and our thoughts remain with all family members.'","Foyez Ahmed, 31, was sentenced to a minimum of 22 years in jail after killing Razu Khan in Oldham, Greater Manchester .

"By . Mark Duell . Missing British guns that were being stored in the US consulate in Libya could have been seized by extremists after the site was destroyed. An attack last month on the consulate in Benghazi - which killed US Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans - followed Foreign Office diplomats’ withdrawal from the city in June. The officials departed after an assassination attempt on the British ambassador, but left weapons and vehicles at the lightly-guarded US compound after an agreement was struck with the Americans. Destroyed: The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi is seen in flames during a protest by an armed group last month . Inspecting the remains: This file photo shows Libyans walking on the grounds of the gutted U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, after an attack that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens . One month after the attack, the equipment is still unaccounted for - and Libyans have been walking through the site’s remains, so guns could have already been seized, reported the Daily Telegraph. The revelations came during a U.S. congressional hearing on Wednesday, which heard evidence from Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Wood, who headed a 16-member U.S. military force in Libya. He said the British could ‘leave their weapons and vehicles on our compound in Benghazi’ and would ‘come back and at times withdraw their weapons and vehicles and then return them and leave’. Politicians at the hearing asked why the US stayed in the city even after the British pulled out as they thought it was no longer safe. Lt Col Wood said the withdrawal should have been a warning sign.

"By . Kate Lyons . and Candace Sutton . The day after a group of teenagers terrorised their peers, students of Sydney's Jewish colleges were met with the sight of heavily armed chaperones when they boarded the bus and went to school. Police officers with guns holstered in their belts and security guards wearing bulletproof vests flanked children on buses and outside schools on Thursday after a group of teenagers allegedly launched a tirade of anti-Semitic slurs when they boarded a bus in Sydney's east on Wednesday afternoon, The Daily Telegraph reported. Since then, CCTV footage has emerged that shows a group of teenagers near the Randwick bus-stop where a bus was boarded and school children were terrorised. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage shows a group of teenagers near the busstop in question yesterday . The video shows a gang walking through the street towards, apparently intoxicated. Witnesses told Nine News the young men also graffitied on a number of businesses in the area. The teenagers are believed to be the same teenagers who will be re-interviewed by police and may be charged over an alleged hate crime directed at a busload of Jewish children yesterday. Young school children who were on board the bus during the tirade have been giving statements to police this afternoon. It is alleged the group of six males aged in their late teens were drunk when they boarded a school bus in Sydney and subjected about 25 school students to a racial abuse, including 'anti-Semitic threats and also threats of violence'. One of the teenagers also said they would 'slit their throats' Five of the youths, believed to be aged between 15 and 17, were arrested on Thursday morning. 'I've been told and believe that these six juveniles were intoxicated and that is something that we'll also address during the course of (their interviews),' Police Inspector Jason Box said. Last night a sixth teenager, believed to be 14, was being interviewed by police. Inspector Box said he believed the incident was opportunistic, 'isolated and random'. Jacqui Blackburn and her children arrive at Bondi Police station after witnessing the abuse . Ms Blackburn's three daughters, aged 8, 10 and 12, were on board the bus at the time of the incident . Children as young as five were among the busload terrorised on Wednesday afternoon when the young men dressed in baggy pants and t-shirts boarded the bus at Randwick, just before 4pm. Several students made frantic calls to their parents after the youths started yelling 'kill the Jews' and 'free Palestine', and 'Heil Hitler'. Jacqui Blackburn's three daughters, aged 8, 10 and 12, were on board the bus at the time of the incident. She told Daily Mail Australia about the 'terrifying' moment she received a call from her eldest daughter saying the bus had been boarded by the group of teenagers. 'The call was ""Mummy please help, there's very dangerous drunk men on this bus, please help us."" Then the phone went dead,' she said. 'My heart was palpitating out of my throat, I literally couldn't talk. I couldn't function I was shaking to the extent that I couldn't phone their dad. 'I didn't know if they were going to make it off the bus or not. I didn't know if these guys were armed, if they had weapons of any kind.' Children as young as five were terrorised on Wednesday afternoon when eight young men hopped on their bus at Randwick, in Sydney's east, about 4pm . Many of the young children had boarded the school bus at Mount Sinai College in Marourbra, in Sydney's east . Ms Blackburn said the group of teenagers had knocked the phone out of her daughter's hand, but that her daughter's friend found it and called her. The friend told Ms Blackburn that the teenagers were 'threatening to slit our throats' and were chanting 'Free Palestine', 'Heil Hitler' and 'Kill the Jews'. 'They were chanting: ""Palestine, Palestine, Palestine, you've taken over our country, what do you want with our country?""' Ms Blackburn said the boys were 'white Aussies' and were wearing baggy pants, not school uniforms as some media reports have stated. The children on the bus told her the teenagers were so drunk 'they couldn't even stand' and told the children they had been taking drugs in the city. Ms Blackburn, who fled her native South Africa because of the high crime rate, said 'I have never been so scared in my life'. 'When I got that call, I went totally to pieces, every part of my body was jumping. 'To hear my kids like that and to see every child's face when they stopped that bus, everybody in tears – boys and girls.' Noa Stanton was one of the students on board the bus who witnessed the horrifying attack. 'They were crazy and when they saw us in tears they were all laughing,' Noa told Seven News Sydney. 'They didn't care and neither did the bus driver.' Noa's mother Isabel Stanton labelled the attack as 'traumatising'. 'They [the children] don't understand the magnitude of the words that were used against them,' she told Seven News Sydney. The children were travelling on a government-run bus that picks up school students from Moriah College in Queens Park, Mt Sinai College in Maroubra and Emanuel School in Randwick. The bus is not open to members of the public. Detective Superintendent Jason Box confirmed that five teenagers were arrested for the alleged vicious anti-Semitic attack on a group of Jewish school children yesterday . The teenagers were arrested by police in the early hours of this morning and will be re-interviewed by police later today . Parents picked up their children from Rose Bay and gave statements to police, but Ms Blackburn said when she questioned the bus driver he wouldn't justify why he let the men on to the school bus in the first place. 'He was very rude to me, he swore at me and he wouldn't give me any information. I said: ""Mate the police are onto you, they are all over the roads."" He told me to ""f*** off,""' she said. Ms Blackburn said the group had targeted an earlier bus travelling from the three Jewish schools and had kicked at the door, but were not allowed on board. Ms Blackburn, who spoke to Daily Mail Australia after dropping her daughters at school today, said they were 'pretty traumatised and... pretty scared' and were having counselling at school. Ms Blackburn commended the police's swift response and 'caring' response to the children. Parents offered to carpool and drive any scared children to school who no longer felt safe riding the bus. 'Following the bus ordeal yesterday I'd like to offer two spare seat I have in my car to any kids who would prefer not to catch the bus,' wrote one mother of a student at Mt Sinai College in Maroubra. Vic Alhadeff, CEO of NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said the Jewish community was 'horrified' by what took place. 'All racism is to be deplored, anti-Semitism is to be deplored and when it is directed against vulnerable young children how much more despicable an act it is,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'This sort of behaviour is not what we do in Australia... Innocent young children going home from school have been abused because of their religion, because of their race. It is simply unacceptable and we as a society have to make it clear in the strongest possible terms that this outrageous behaviour is not only to be condemned but to be punished.' Mr Alhadeff said that it was particularly troubling to encounter bigotry among people so young. 'It raises concerns about where the negative influences are emanating, is it from the home? Is it from peers?' This little girl held a doll covered with red paint during a rally in Sydney against Israel's military campaign in Gaza on Sunday . On the same day, 10,000 people protested at a pro-Israeli rally in Sydney's eastern suburbs . NSW Communities Minister Victor Dominello said he was deeply disturbed by the reports. 'We've been so lucky in this country that we have not had so much blood shed that we've seen overseas and in order to avoid that happening we must continue to condemn any racial attacks that we see in this country,' he said. NSW Transport minister, Gladys Berejiklian said she was appalled at the incident. 'I’m appalled by the behaviour of these passengers,' she said. 'The State Transit Authority (STA) is co-operating with police in its investigation. STA is also investigating the matter to ensure the driver followed all proper procedures and STA will take action if required. 'I have also asked STA to ensure all drivers are aware of the proper procedures they should follow.' Both Israeli and Palestinian supporters took to Sydney's streets on Sunday to pledge support for their respective sides in the escalating Middle East conflict. Mothers and children waved graphic photographs of the Gaza conflict's casualties and others held up baby dolls with red splotches as thousands surrounded Town Hall in the Sydney CBD to draw attention to Palestine's plight. While heavy security surrounded a Dover Heights park in Sydney's eastern suburbs as a blue and white sea of 10,000 Israeli people and supporters deplored the loss of life in the conflict.","Police officers and security guards were out in force at Sydney's Jewish schools on Thursday .

"By . Allan Hall . Marbles that once belonged to the world's most famous Holocaust victim - teenaged diarist Anne Frank - have turned up over seventy years after she gave them to a friend for safekeeping before she and her family went into hiding. Anne never lived to reclaim the marbles. After hiding in an attic with her family they were betrayed to the Nazis, arrested and shipped off to concentration camps.  She died in the Bergen-Belsen camp early in 1945. The Anne Frank House Museum in Amsterdam reported this week that Anne's tin of marbles has been handed to it and went on display for the first time on Tuesday at an art gallery in Rotterdam. In this May 1941 photo Anne Frank, left, plays with her friend Hanneli Goslar, right, on the Merwedeplein square in Amsterdam . Shortly before Anne Frank and her family went into hiding from the Nazis, she gave away some of her toys to non-Jewish neighborhood girlfriend Toosje Kupers for safekeeping . The neighbour, Toosje Kupers, kept the marbles along with a tea set and a book. The now 83-year-old Kupers told a Dutch broadcaster that after World War II ended she had offered the items to Otto Frank, Anne's father and the only member of the family to survive the Holocaust. She said Anne's father, who returned to the secret attic where they hid from the Germans in 1942 to find her now-famous diary, told her she could keep the marbles. For years, the tin box with the marbles remained in a cupboard, and were only discovered again during a recent house move. Toosje Kupers, centre, was given the toys for safekeeping by Anne, before her family were forced to hide .

Anne Frank, the young Jewish girl who, with her family, hid from the Nazis in Amsterdam, Netherlands, during World War II . The items are on display in an exhibit on World War II in Rotterdam's Kunsthal museum. Museum spokeswoman Annemarie Bekkers said that Frank was one of many Jewish children who gave away toys before being deported and dying in the Holocaust. Anne Frank wrote her diary while in hiding from Nazi persecution during World War II. The Frank family moved to Amsterdam from Germany in 1933. By 1940 the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands, leaving the family trapped. In 1942 the family went into hiding in the hidden rooms of Otto Frank's office building . But after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where Anne died of typhus in 1945. Otto Frank, Anne's father, returned to Amsterdam after the war and discovered her diary had been saved. It was published in 1947, leading to her posthumous fame.","Anne Frank's marbles have turned up over seventy years after she gave them to a friend for safekeeping before she and her family went into hiding .

Jubel Miah, 21 - who in 2010 was sent to a young offenders institute for possessing heroin with intent to supply - had ordered his terrified spouse to wear a full niqab after she said she was going to college to study. Initially he called her a ‘slag and b****’ for wanting to better her education, then sneered: ‘You are a married woman. You don’t do this.’ The unnamed wife only agreed to wear the full face veil, with just eye holes after thinking he would stop him making her life a misery. But instead Miah began beating her - initially because she was not smiling during Eid celebrations with family. During a catalogue of violent and controlling behaviour, Miah from Burnley, Lancashire, ripped her tongue, kicked and punched her, inflicted black eyes on her and battered her confidence. He also tracked her movements using his mobile phone, tried to stop her going to college, accused her of cheating and falsely claiming there were ‘spies’ in their loft. When the victim became pregnant she was found to have injuries to her body and eye when she went to hospital for a 16-week check-up. And when she later went through a traumatic birth delivering a premature baby, Miah was so enraged that a male doctor was treating his wife afterwards, a female medic had to be brought. He was also very irate and threatening to people trying to help the family. The wife finally escaped from his clutches after he subjected her to a sustained attack in which he stabbed her with scissors and hit her with a dumbell. Details of her ordeal emerged at Burnley magistrates court as Miah was locked away for 16 weeks after admitting common assault by beating. He was also given an indefinite restraining order to keep him away from the victim. The sentence means Miah could be free in just two months for good behaviour. The maximum sentence he could have faced was six months. After the case Rachel Horman, head of the domestic violence division at law firm Watson Ramsbottom, said: ‘The sentence is an insult to the victim and people will view the punishment as a slap on the wrist. ‘There has been a prolonged 12-month ordeal, so why was only one charge brought? It’s absolutely shocking and it makes me really angry. ‘If this was an attack by a stranger in the street, I can guarantee it would have been a different story. Domestic violence is often under-sentenced and too much blame is given to the victims.’ Earlier, prosecutor Miss Charlotte Crane said the beatings began after Miah ‘interrogated’ his wife about going to college and wearing the veil. He had qualified for the welfare support payments as he could not walk more than five-metres in a minute - but he should not have been able to claim  the payments while living outside the UK, Burnley Magistrates Court heard . Last November the couple had been at Eid celebrations with family, she was playing with some children and Miah demanded to know why she was not smiling. He slapped her face and pushed her against a wall and held her there. Miss Crane said he apologised, the relationship continued but he then accused the victim of talking to men when she was out. The victim, then four months pregnant, said she wasn’t, but was given a black eye. She pleaded with him to stop the abuse and in April the baby was born 10 weeks prematurely. It was kept in special care and every day when the victim returned home from visiting the infant, she was met with further insults. The couple separated but got back together and Miah accused neighbours of spying on her. He ordered her to sit down in silence, left his iPhone on record and checked it on his return to make sure she had not spoken to anybody. He claimed there were people spying and people in the loft. Miss Crane said on September 17, the victim tried to pacify Miah when he believed people were in the house and was angry. He punched her repeatedly, told her he didn’t believe she wasn’t cheating, rammed his fingers in her mouth, pulled her tongue and scratched it until it bled. He kicked and struck her thigh, picked up some scissors and threatened to stab her. The victim put up her right arm and Miah plunged the scissors into her hand, causing a deep gash. He then struck her on the back with a large dumbell. The victim escaped to her mother’s, where her injuries were seen and she told of the abuse. Police were called. The victim had a black eye, cuts to her face, hand and leg and her tongue was sore. Miss Crane added: ‘The defendant is not interested in showing any remorse in any way, shape or form, with regards to the hell he has put this lady through over the last 12 months. ‘If that doesn’t warrant an immediate custodial sentence at the higher level, I don’t know what does.’ In mitigation defence lawyer Adnan Hanif said: ‘It’s not often that I am lost for words.’ He said what Miah had done would probably cause lasting scars to the victim and her family. His family was very upset with him. The solicitor continued: ‘His actions have affected quite a number of people and I would say that quite a number of lives have, in effect, been destroyed. There is nothing that allows the defendant to behave in that manner. I feel sorry for the victim in this case.’","Jubel Miah, 21, from Burnley ripped her tongue and kicked and punched her .

"By . Reuters Reporter . The man behind the anti-Muslim video that has incited violence against the U.S. across the Middle East emerged from hiding on Wednesday to appear in court in Los Angeles to deny he had violated his probation for a previous check fraud conviction. The Egyptian born filmmaker, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, fled his California home on September 11, in the aftermath of the release of his controversial video that has sparked violent protests abroad. He denied in court that he committed eight probation violations, . including lying to officials over the scope his role in the film and . using aliases. In hiding: Filmmaker Mark Basseley Youssef (center, escorted from his home on September 15 by Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers) was arrested after the release of his film, on charges he violated his probation . The California man has been in a federal . detention center since Sept. 28 after he was arrested for eight . probation violations and deemed a flight risk by another judge. Prosecutors said he lied to his probation officers about his real . name and used aliases. A crudely made 13-minute video attributed to the man, who appeared in court on Wednesday under the name Mark Basseley Youssef, was filmed in California and circulated online under several titles including 'Innocence of Muslims.' It portrays the Prophet Mohammad as a fool and a sexual deviant, and sparked a torrent of anti-American unrest in Arab and Muslim countries last month. The violence coincided with a separate attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya. As outrage against the film mounted, U.S. authorities said they were not investigating the film itself. 'My client was not the cause of the violence in the Middle East,' attorney Steven Seiden said after Wednesday's hearing. 'Clearly, it was pre-planned and it was just an excuse and a trigger point to have more violence.' But prosecutors have said they could seek to have Youssef, 55, sent back to prison for up to two years if he is found to have violated his probation on a bank fraud conviction. Not guilty: Youssef's lawyer Steven Seiden (right) said on Wednesday his client has been accused of starting the violence in the Middle East but prosecutors say the case relates only to a probation violation . Youssef, who was escorted to court by . five U.S. Marshals, was ordered held without bail last month and has . been staying at a high-rise federal jail in downtown Los Angeles. Under the terms of his release from . prison last year, Youssef was barred from using aliases without the . permission of a probation officer and restricted from accessing the . Internet. An evidentiary hearing in his probation case was set for . November 9. 'It will be interesting to see what the . judge does and what the reaction is around the world,' said Stan . Goldman, a Loyola Law School professor. Goldman said attorneys for Youssef could argue the terms of his 2011 . release from prison in the bank fraud case did not apply directly to his . recent activities, in which people associated with the film have said . he misrepresented himself. 'It's not exactly like an armed robber on probation, getting caught with . an automatic weapon in his possession. It's a little more technical,' Goldman said. The defendant, who had worked in the gas station industry and most . recently lived in a suburb of Los Angeles, declared at the outset of his . last hearing that he had changed his name to Mark Basseley Youssef in . 2002. The probation issues were the latest of Youssef's legal woes. An actress . who says she was duped into appearing in the anti-Islam film has sued . him over the matter, identifying him as the film's producer. Cindy Lee . Garcia also named YouTube and its parent company Google Inc as . defendants in the case. Google has refused to remove the film from YouTube, despite pressure . from the White House and others to take it down, though the company has . blocked the trailer in Egypt, Libya and other Muslim countries.

"By . Tom Gardner . Michelle Obama and some of the biggest names in the NFL have led the congratulatory messages to Michael Sam, the Missouri football player who yesterday revealed he is gay. The first lady personally expressed her admiration for the defensive lineman, who could become the first openly homosexual NFL player if he is selected for the league later this year. 'You're an inspiration to all of us,' she wrote. 'We couldn't be prouder of your courage both on and off the field.' 'Thank you for your kind words,' he responded. 'Humbled by your support.' Scroll down for video . Strong: Missouri senior defensive lineman Michael Sam speaks to the media during an NCAA college football news conference in Irving, Texas. Sam says he is gay, and he could become the first openly homosexual player in the NFL . '#respect bro,' Richie Incognito of the Miami Dolphons sent Sam on Twitter. 'It takes guts to do what you did. I wish u nothing but the best.' Jonathan Martin, who has had his fair share of struggles in recent months following the Dolphins' alleged bullying scandal, added: 'Hats off to you Michael Sam, that takes some guts #respect.' Tom Crabtree of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers added: 'Good for Michael Sam. Takes courage for where he is in his career and where we are as a league. I applaud him.' The comments section in his Facebook . page was also inundated with people praising him as a 'positive role . model for many' and thanking him for his 'brave and class act'. Proud: Michelle Obama tweeted a message of support to Michael Sam, commending his decision . Response: Sam responded to the first lady on Twitter, thanking her for her support . Support: Members of the NFL, including Martin and Incognito of the Miami Dolphins, also supported him . But while they offered their support, hundreds of internet trolls bombarded Sam with a slew of personal attacks, while senior sport insiders warned his decision could ruin his professional career. His announcement provoked a particularly strong backlash from religious sectors. Within hours of his announcement . yesterday, the Missouri defensive lineman was told he was 'hellbound' and he was part of a 'gay commercial being shoved down children's . throats'. One internet user . called Anco Andrede said: 'If you accept homosexualitys (sic) you are . hellbound for eternity with no chance of escape when the demons rip you . apart and put you together again and torture you forever...' The poster also demanded that he 'repent to God almighty or you will go there [Hell] forever.' Another added that Sam should now be required to use other shower facilities in the locker room. Game mode: In an image taken last month, Sam warms up before the Cotton Bowl NCAA football game . Proud: The image - as with many others - shows Sam has been wearing a rainbow-colored wrist band showing his allegiance to the gay community for numerous games. His teammates said they knew for 5 years . However, the vast majority of comments were positive and welcomed news that a top sportsman had the courage to come out. But it was not just the darker realms of the internet which reacted angrily to Sam's revelations. Several . NFL insiders said the news that he was gay had done serious damage to . his career prospects in the top-flight American football league and . harmed his earning potential. An NFL assistant coach, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told Sports Illustrated it was 'not a smart move'. Another insider added: 'I don't think football is ready for [an openly gay player] just yet. 'In the coming decade or two, it's going to be acceptable, but at this point in time it's still a man's-man game. To call somebody a [gay slur] is still so commonplace. It'd chemically imbalance an NFL locker room and meeting room.' Coming out: Missouri All-American Michael Sam . says he is gay, and the defensive end could become the first openly . homosexual player in the NFL . Sin: One twitter user attacked the NFL prospect as someone who was being 'praised for sin' 'Hellbound': Other postings on YouTube said Michael Sam would be 'hellbound' and would be ripped apart by demons for being gay . Abuse: Some internet users took to the comments section under the YouTube video of Michael Sam coming out to launch a torrent of abuse . A number of senior figures thought . the massive media attention now brought upon Sam, especially until the . NFL draft on May 8, could harm his likelyhood of being picked by a top . team for the next season. An assistant coach told Sports Illustrated: 'There are guys in locker rooms that maturity-wise cannot handle it or deal with the thought of that.' Missouri's All-American defensive lineman, 23, a 6-foot-2, 260-pound senior, released a series of coordinated interviews with The New York Times and ESPN's Outside the Lines program on Sunday. 'I'm Michael Sam. I'm a football player and I'm gay,' Sam, a defensive lineman, said in the video posted online. 'I just want to own my truth before anyone breaks a story about me.' He went on to say that when he first spoke with his teammates about his sexuality last August, they rallied around him and supported him. 'We admire Michael Sam's honesty and courage,' the NFL said in a statement. Respect: In interviews with ESPN, The New York Times and Outsports that were published Sunday, Michael Sam said his teammates and coaches at Missouri have known since August. 'Michael is a football player. Any . player with ability and determination can succeed in the NFL. We look . forward to welcoming and supporting Michael Sam in 2014.' Representatives . for Sam had been letting NFL teams aware that he was planning to come . out before this month's NFL scouting combine. No NFL player has ever announced publicly he's gay while his career is active. Former players including Esera Tuaolo have admitted they are gay after retiring. In his series of interviews, Sam said, 'I am an openly, proud gay man.' 'It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.' Other athletes to come out as gay have included Jason Collins, a veteran of 12 NBA seasons who revealed he was homosexual last year and Robbie Rogers, who plays Major League Soccer with the LA Galaxy. Division III Willamette kicker Conner Mertens, a redshirt freshman, said last month he was bisexual. Sportsman: Before coming out to all his teammates and coaches, Sam said he told a few close friends and dated another Missouri athlete who was not a football player . Michael Sam's sexuality had apparently been an open secret since August last year. But a close teammate has told how the secret was kept much longer than that. Missouri linebacker Donovan Bonner has been a teammate of Sam's for five years. 'We knew of his status for five years and not one team member, coach, or staff member said anything says a lot about our family atmosphere,' Bonner tweeted. Sam said many people at the college all-star game for NFL prospects seemed to know that he was gay. Before . coming out to all his teammates and coaches, Sam said he told a few . close friends and dated another Missouri athlete who was not a football . player. 'And I used that opportunity just to tell them that I was gay. And their reaction was like, `Michael Sam finally told us.'"" Missouri coach Gary Pinkel said in a statement Sunday night he was proud of Sam and how he represented the program. 'Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he's taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn't matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we're all on the same team and we all support each other,' Pinkel said. 'If Michael doesn't have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, I don't think there's any way he has the type of season he put together.' First: NBA Player Jason Collins became the first active basketball player to come out last year and Robbie Rogers 8 (right) of Team USA and LA Galaxy came out last year too . Speaking to ESPN, Sam said that, 'I came to tell the world' about his sexual orientation. He said that though he was nervous about doing it, it also felt good. 'It's a load off my chest,' he said. 'I told my teammates this past August that I came out to my teammates, and they took it great. They rallied around me, they supported me, and I couldn't have asked for better teammates.'","Michael Sam could become the first openly homosexual .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Students have found a new way to sneak marijuana into schools by using vapor pens that allow them to smoke without giving off the drug's distinctive smell. Since Colorado legalized the drug, school administrators have had to fight back against students who finding creative ways to get high during class. Edibles and inhalers that have been turned into makeshift bongs were two of the first ways that caught on, but now vapor pens are causing a more difficult problem because they are the most discrete. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Discrete: Vapor pens do not look very different from regular pens but they hold oil capsules that are then melted down and turned into vapor that allows users to smoke it and get high . The pens, sold for upwards of $25, were initially used for cigarette smokers but now people can buy tablets of marijuana oil to place in the pens. 'I’ve seen people in my math class and they’ll be sitting there with the teacher and they’ll be smoking it and they won’t even know,' said Lakewood High School student Jack Maestas. The plastic around the capsule is melted by the water in the pen and the user inhales a whiff of the result from a small mouthpiece at the end of the pen. When vapor pens are used by cigarette smokers, they insert a capsule of liquit nicotine as opposed to tobacco. Because the water mixes with the oil, the smell normally associated with the drug is dilluted to a point that it isn't noticeable. Tip off: Users exhale the vapor, but can do it more discretely than this person so that teachers don't notice . The only possible tip off for teachers comes when some users exhale the vapor back out of their mouths, but that only lasts a second making it tough to pin down. Principal Ron Castagna told CBS Denver that teachers have been clued into the trend and are keeping an eye out for any suspicious activity. 'The nervous habit of biting on your pen has a new meaning to it,' Mr Castagna said. The trend is being helped by a prevalence of YouTube videos that show people demonstrating how retool vapor pens for marijuana, showing ways to keep the smoke controlled while using it during class. All different flavors: Vapor pens were originally used for cigarette smokers, and different flavors of nicotine were sold in Paris (pictured) but in Colorado many are using the oil from marijuana plants instead . To combat e-cigarettes becoming a gateway for other more harmful substances, New York assembleywoman Linda Rosenthal introduced a bill last year making it illegal to sell e-cigarettes to minors. 'Once you try electronic cigarettes, you can become hooked to them, move on to cigarettes and then move on to other drugs,' Rosenthal told NBC. Some other states, including New Jersey, New Hampshire and Maryland, have also banned the sale of e-cigarettes to minors.","Capsules with marijuana oil can be put into vapor pens that allow users to get high by sucking in the smoke from the end of the pen .

"By . Peter Simpson . Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong yesterday to demand greater democracy and the resignation of the city’s Beijing-back leader - with some waving British colonial flags. Since taking office in July, Leung Chun-ying’s popularity ratings have tumbled amid a row over illegal structures at his luxury home and his closeness to China’s communist leaders. Holding up posters of Mr Leung portrayed as a vampire and a wolf, some of estimated 130,000 protesters waved flags from the British colonial era which has the Union jack in the left hand corner. Anti-government protesters calling for the resignation of Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung, are seen with the British colonial flag of Hong Kong, as they march through the streets of the city during a New Year's Day rally . Anger: Tens of thousands of protestors took to Hong Kong's streets in protest todat, many were wearing Guy Fawkes masks . They chanted ‘Give us universal suffrage now’ and ‘Step down, Leung’. Many in the former British colony of seven million  - which was returned to China 15 years ago -  claim Mr Leung is a ‘stooge of Beijing’. They say under his leadership the city’s semi-autonomous status, which guarantees civil liberties including the right to protest not seen on the mainland, is being eroded. An unpopular pro-Beijing education curriculum that was later shelved, high property prices and a massive influx of mainland Chinese has seen resentment against China increase. And protesters claim promised political reform  - including universal suffrage  - has been stonewalled by Beijing, which says the city’s chief executive could be directly elected in 2017 at the earliest. ‘We don’t even have a vote, Leung is elected by a small group of people. We cannot use our voting right to express our view no matter how his performance is,’ said protester, designer Calvin Tse. On the march: Tens of thousands of protestors marched through the Hong Kong streets calling for greater democracy and the resignation of Leung Chun-ying whose popularity has tumbled since he took office in July . Rally: Holding up posters of Mr Leung portrayed as a vampire and a wolf, some of estimated 130,000 protesters waved flags from the British colonial era which has the Union jack in the left hand corner . Hundreds of police blocked protesters marching to the symbolic former Legislative Council Building. Hong Kong’s last governor, the now BBC Trust chairman Chris Patten,  introduced democratic reforms when he took office in 1992. Packed streets: Protestors carry a poster of the city's leader Leung Chung-ying during a protest against his rule . The move outraged Beijing which threatened to overturn any decisions when it took control and the ensuing crisis in UK-Sino relations caused the Hong Kong stock market to crash. Though Patten’s reforms fell short of universal suffrage, elections of some Legislative Council members took place in 1995  - and many Hong Kongers now say life was more progressive under UK-rule. ‘We are now banned from “walking” 15 years after returning to Chinese rule,’ said one of yesterday’s march organisers, Albert Chan Wai-yip. About 1,000 police were deployed following scuffles over the weekend at a pro-government rally that saw two journalists assaulted. Hong Kong’s leaders are chosen by an exclusive 1,200 electoral college of mostly pro-Beijing elites, and then must be approved by Beijing, which nominates contenders. In a bid to tackle discontent, Mr Leung last year banned mainland Chinese women from giving birth in Hong Kong in an attempt to secure residence rights for their children. He has also introduced policies to prioritise housing for locals - a move which analysts say was a reaction to mainland buyers pushing up prices in one of the world’s most expensive property markets. A half million strong anti-government rally in 2003 later forced former leader Tung Chee-hwa from office mid-term.

"By . Corey Charlton . Britain's most prolific game show contestant has been honoured in the Guinness Book of Records for a career that saw him claim just a handful of prizes. David St John, 65, from Cannock, Staffordshire, has appeared on game shows 34 times but has won only £5,000 after slipping to defeat on 25 occasions. However, he has just been crowned with the official title of Most TV Quiz Appearances by the Guinness Book of World Records, for his glittering 30-year career. Over the past 30 years he has appeared on 34 of the most popular quiz shows, including The Weakest Link, Eggheads, 15 to 1 and The Chase, and has had been crowned champion nine times. The married grandfather-of-four started out as a quiz show newbie in 1982, on Sale of the Century, where he won the show and his first prize - two motorbikes. David St John, right, during his first quiz appearance on Sale of the Century with host Nicholas Parsons . David St John, pictured second from left, with the two motorbikes he won on Sale of the Century in 1982 . Mr St John competing alongside a much younger Daphne Fowler from Eggheads in the 1986 Sale of the Century 'Ashes', for which UK contestants were flown to Melbourne, Australia to compete . He said: 'Out of all of the shows I’ve been on the most memorable was Sale of the Century. It is my favourite because it was my first - and they say you never forget your first.' Mr St John, who works as a comedy entertainer doing gigs and events across the country, has met some quiz show greats during his career. This has included Eggheads’ Daphne Fowler during the Australian version of Sale of the Century as well as the so-called 'Queen of Mean' Anne Robinson on The Weakest Link in 2001. 'I was most excited about meeting Bob Monkhouse on Wipeout in 1998. He was a comedy genius and one of my idols.' He has also become well known due to his unchanging hair style over the years and has taken home around £5,000 prize money. The one show he wishes he could have been on was Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - where he thinks he could have pocketed the cash. 'I tried a few times to get on that show but never managed to get through. I would like to think I would have made it to a million - I would have certainly given it a good go.' But with 34 appearances under his belt, he was over the moon to hear of his official record. 'I was gobsmacked at the news. I knew I had been in a lot but that really does set a precedent.

I am very proud of what I have achieved.' David St John has collected a range of merchandise items, perks and cash prizes for his numerous appearances on game shows. Included in the list of items gifted to him are, unsurprisingly, many dictionaries, thesauruses and encyclopedias, as well as two motorbikes, pens, t-shirts and even a gold Kangaroo broach. The one major perk he has received was a two-week, expenses paid holiday in Melbourne to appear on the Australian version of Sale of the Century. And his total prize money? His nine wins have only earned him a total of about £5000, with a lot more cash having slipped through his grasp. But his ultimate dream is to become the quiz master of his own show. Mr St John said: 'I have been lucky enough to meet some great TV personalities along the way. 'But my dream would be to host my own quiz show. I would love the opportunity to go full circle and be the host. 'In my job as a comedy entertainer I have hosted quiz shows on cruises and up and down the UK, but I would love the experience of hosting my own show and I think after all this time I certainly have the right credentials for it.' His wife of 40 years, Maria, 59, has supported him the whole way and he would always make his quiz show appearances a family day out, taking along his two daughters Mikaela, 43 and Tina, 27. 'My family have been very supportive of me, and it’s such a fun thing to be involved in. 'My advice to other quiz show contestants just starting out is to go for it. It’s really fun - you do run the risk of humiliation and it’s a lot of high pressure but it’s worth it. Mr St John with his Guinness World Record documents showing he has made the most quiz show appearances . He simply has a great memory and does not spend hours in front of the TV trying to learn new bits of trivia . 'It’s really frustrating when you get the answer wrong, but some shows have really moody music atmospheric music and dim lighting and it can put you off so I try not to feel too bad about it. I can’t always get the answers all right.' He insists unlike other quiz show contestants, he doesn’t spend hours in front of the TV every day learning new information, he just has a natural ability to retain facts. 'Throughout the years I’ve found most quiz show people sit there all day every day studying for quizzes, but I have a bit of gift for it. Being in a band when I was younger I have a good brain for remember lyrics and bits of information and jokes which has really helped me. “I have been motivated by friends who have teased me about my trivia knowledge and asked: ""what’s the point?"" 'But for me it has been great to use my extensive trivia knowledge for TV quizzes.'

"By . Dr Tony Cooper . On Saturday, a huge sinkhole opened up at the side of a house in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. Swallowing up half of the front lawn, it was 35ft wide and 20ft deep. Last week, a hole as deep as a double-decker bus is high suddenly opened up in the back-garden of a house in South-East London, almost swallowing a child’s trampoline as the ground collapsed without warning. Had the poor owner’s daughter been rushing out to play on the trampoline, she could have very easily have been seriously injured or even killed. Scroll down for video . A 50ft-deep hole appeared in the central reservation on a section of the M2 in north Kent earlier this year . Two weeks ago, there was a similarly narrow escape for a family living in High Wycombe, when, overnight, a deep hole appeared  without warning in the driveway just next to the house. This time the adult daughter’s car did end up buried at the bottom of the hole, thankfully, while there was no one in it. And in Kent last week, motorists hoping to use the M2 were left fuming by the motorway’s temporary closure, after a substantial hole — 15ft deep — suddenly appeared in the central reservation. Again, no one was hurt but had the hole opened up just a few yards away, it is obvious what a different story it could so easily have been. All of these holes are what the public call sinkholes and now, after weeks of heavy rain, they seem to be appearing with ever greater regularity. Hard statistics are difficult to find — not least because sinkholes that appear on farmland often go unreported — but having studied them for 35 years, I’d estimate that sinkholes are currently appearing at four-to-five times their normal rate. Gone: A Volkswagen Lupo was swallowed up by this sink hole in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire . Brand new: Zoe Smith, 19, was given a replacement after the car was engulfed by the hole which developed outside her home . With more heavy rain forecast, I’d be surprised if we’ve seen the last sudden sinkhole of this winter. Even when the rain does stop and warmer weather returns, for reasons that I’ll come to, there could be a second spate of them. Strictly speaking — and as I work for the British Geological Survey I do need to be strict about these things — not all the big holes that have been appearing are sinkholes. Technically, a sinkhole is a hole that opens up when the surface layers collapse into a naturally made cavity. When the surface layers collapse into a cavity made by man  — and at least two of the recent holes are in areas where mining has been carried out in the past — then it should be called a dene or crown hole. But given that both types are caused by a collapse into an underground cavity and the end result — a large, potentially dangerous hole in the ground at the surface — is the same, for the sake of simplicity, let us call them all sinkholes. Certainly, anyone suffering the tragedy of having their house fall into one won’t be worrying about the difference. Fatalities caused by sinkholes in this country are thankfully very rare, but a homeowner in Florida did die in exactly those circumstances only last year. Risk: Gretel Davidson feared she would have to pay around £10,000 after a sinkhole twice the height of a double-decker bus appeared in her garden in Banehurst, South-East London . The sheer size of sinkholes and their sudden appearance without warning does make them extremely hazardous. This explains why in  the superstitious distant past,  their appearance was often linked to misfortune. Some saw them as a direct route to Hell itself; one near Darlington that collapsed in the 12th century  is called Hell Kettle and the  rising groundwater in it steams in the winter. Of course, it’s not the Devil but all the heavy rain that lies behind the sudden spate of sinkholes. Rainwater dissolves limestone easily because it gets acidified from  carbon dioxide in the air and by  passing through rotting vegetation or certain types of rock. The water dissolves rocks such  as chalk, limestone and gypsum, making existing natural underground cavities bigger. It also scours fine material out of existing cavities. In addition, it makes the surface layers of soil composed of such things as clay or gravel heavier as they become waterlogged. Bit by bit, the cavity becomes a little bigger, the covering layers a little heavier until . . . snap . . . those covering layers no longer have the mechanical strength to span the cavity and suddenly they collapse into it, taking anything unfortunate to have been standing on the surface down with them. Concern: A 35ft wide hole appeared underneath a home in Hemel Hempstead last week, prompting the surrounding properties to be evacuated . It’s no accident that sinkholes often seem to appear next to a fairly substantial piece of civil engineering, such as a house or road, rather than underneath the piece of civil engineering itself. As long as we put roofs on houses and impermeable cambers on our roads, rainwater will be thrown off the things being protected. It’s often where that rainwater ends up — by the side of the road, by side  of the house — that becomes  vulnerable to sinkholes. Nor is it a coincidence that so many of the new sinkholes have appeared in the South-East. Not only has this part of the country endured one of its wettest winters for decades, possibly centuries, but it is also home to one of the four types of underlying soluble rock — in this case chalk — that make an area vulnerable to sinkholes. It’s also an area where mining of some sort — in the form of chalk diggings, clay pits, flint mines etc   — has been going on for thousands of years. The South-East, however, is not the only area that is vulnerable. Much of Yorkshire lies on chalk, although the fact that it has been covered by glaciers several times means that most of the surface  cavities have long been worn away, making it more resilient to sinkholes than the softer, purer chalk of the South-East. Pipes: The owner of the house above the hole is said to have warned the council about the situation weeks in advance . The underlying limestone of areas such as the Pennines, South Wales, North Wales and part of Cumbria make all those areas vulnerable to both natural sinkholes and collapses over mines, as the appearance of one of the biggest recent holes — some 160ft across in Foolow, Derbyshire — at the end of last year certainly confirmed, when an old lead and fluorite mine collapsed. Other vulnerable areas include a belt between Darlington and Doncaster, where the underlying rock is the highly soluble gypsum. This belt takes in the city of Ripon, which could well lay claim to the unwanted title of Sinkhole Capital Of Britain and is home to one of the most enduring sinkholes in the country, which first appeared in 1834 and remains open today, being some 36ft across and 46ft deep. Wedged: A Los Angeles fireman looks under a fire truck stuck in a sinkhole in 2009 . Parts of Cheshire are also highly vulnerable to sinkholes, thanks to underlying mineral salt deposits which could have been removed both naturally and, of course, by man. Britain’s sinkholes, however, tend to be dwarfed by those found in other parts of the world, such as the 131ft wide, 67ft deep, water-filled Bimmah Sinkhole in Oman, the 400ft deep Devil’s Sinkhole in Texas, and the Great Blue Hole off the coast of Belize, another underwater hole some 984ft wide and 410ft deep. Guatemala City, built on particularly soft, volcanic rock, has been dubbed the Sinkhole Capital Of The World. But it’s the growing number of sinkholes reported in parts of China and the United States that is potentially of greater concern for those  keeping an eye on sinkhole activity in the UK. Trapped: A family were in a car when it fell into a sink hold in Hetian, Xinjiang, China . In these countries, many of the new sinkholes are being caused not by an excess of water — be it rain, leaking drains or burst water mains — but by the systematic extraction of groundwater for irrigation or mining purposes; often with disastrous consequences. Just as covering layers can become too waterlogged to support themselves over a cavity, so they can also collapse as water drains out of a cavity below. And that does worry me about what might happen in  Britain over the coming months. The heavy winter rains have already produced more sinkholes than normal and, although their appearance is notoriously hard to predict, it would be a brave geologist who would say we’ve seen the last of them for this winter. Vanished: 20 holes disappeared after a 150m-wide sink hole opened up in Guatemala . But the rain will also have done more unseen damage underground, widening out cavities, weakening supporting pillars, washing out the fine deposits that may have kept them stable for decades. When warmer weather does return, the groundwater will lower, the layers that cover these now  widened holes will begin to drain and, in certain cases, their mechanical strength begin to weaken until — crash! — those surface layers literally reach breaking point. One way or another, come rain or indeed shine, we almost certainly haven’t seen the last sinkhole of 2014. So be careful where you park your car tonight.","Sinkholes seen in Kent, South-East London and Hemel Hempstead .

"By . Jenny Hope . More than one in five women say they suffer from anxiety most or all of the time – almost double the number five years ago. Some 22 per cent admit being preoccupied with everyday worries such as money and the welfare of loved ones. The figure has soared since 2009, when just 12 per cent of women said they felt frightened or anxious, a survey by the Mental Health Foundation reveals. More than one in five women say they suffer from anxiety most or all of the time - almost double the number five years ago . The charity’s Living With Anxiety report highlights a rise in sufferers across both sexes, with nearly half of people saying they get more anxious than they used to. Almost one in five (19 per cent) of  the 2,300 people polled by YouGov said they feel anxious a lot or all the time,  citing money, finance and debt as their  top concerns. But the most startling finding is among the 1,200 women taking part in the poll. Some 22 per cent said they felt anxious nearly all (5 per cent) or a lot (17 per cent) of the time, compared with 15 per cent of men. And 52 per cent of women said they get more frightened or anxious than they used to, compared with 43 per cent five years ago. Money worries were cited as the main causes of anxiety for 48 per cent of women, with the welfare of loved ones and children coming second for 44 per cent. In 2009, finance (55 per cent) and the death of loved ones (55 per cent) were equally cited as the main trigger factors. Around a quarter of women say they would be embarrassed to tell anyone they felt anxious. The charity is now launching a major campaign – coinciding with Mental Health Awareness Week – to raise understanding of anxiety and its potential effect on mental and emotional wellbeing. Tracey Crouch said the stress-relief sessions, which are based on Buddhist meditation techniques, helped her through a 'low period' in her life . A Tory MP has described how courses in ‘mindfulness’ helped cure her anxiety. Tracey Crouch said the stress-relief sessions, which are based on Buddhist meditation techniques, helped her through a ‘low period’ in her life. The member for Chatham and Aylesford says more than 70 MPs and peers have now signed up to take part in the fashionable courses over the coming weeks. And she wants GPs to consider prescribing the therapy rather than handing out so many anti-depressants. Mindfulness could also be used in schools to help children concentrate and even help soldiers overcome post-traumatic stress disorder, she said. Speaking on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, Miss Crouch, 38, said her family doctor suggested she went on a course last year instead of relying on medication. She added: ‘Last year 53million  prescriptions for antidepressants were written and I think we need to look at alternative ways of coping with anxiety and stress.’ She said the stigma around mental health meant it was still hard to admit needing help. However, the NHS is now sending more patients on mindfulness courses and an all-party parliamentary group will be launched this month to look at how the government can make use of it. Mindfulness, pioneered in the US in the 1970s, encourages practitioners to slow down and ‘inhabit the moment’ rather than worrying about  the past or the future. Hollywood stars Meg Ryan and Goldie Hawn are said to be fans of the technique, which uses breathing exercises and stretching as well as meditation. Although anxiety is a natural emotion, . it can lead to disorders such as panic, phobias and obsessive . behaviours, says the report. Many . find solace in potentially harmful coping strategies, with a quarter . comfort eating and nearly one in five ‘hiding away from the world’. More . than a quarter think anxiety is a sign of not being able to cope and 29 . per cent say they would be embarrassed to admit to it. As a result, only 7 per cent overall go to a GP about anxiety – although almost a third of women say they would do so. More than half (57 per cent) of people wish they could be less anxious – up from 17 per cent five years ago. Jenny . Edwards, of the Mental Health Foundation, described the findings as . ‘stark’. She said: ‘Women often are the ones who juggle the family . finances and try to make ends meet in hard times. We know women often . put themselves last when they have to cut back on life’s little . luxuries, or even essentials.’ Women . also tend to shoulder most of the burden for caring, which can add to . daily worries, she said. TV presenter Anna Williamson, 32, has suffered . from generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder for the past decade . but has urged sufferers to seek out ‘talking therapies’. She said: ‘I . know only too well the feelings of dread, the severe panic attacks and . the irrational thinking that go hand in hand with anxiety.’ NHS figures . recently revealed that a third of all hospital admissions for anxiety . are women over 60. Last . year a total of 8,720 patients were treated in hospital for anxiety – . 2,440 of whom were women over the age of 60. Other figures show that . women make up nearly two thirds of patients seeking treatment for . depression – with a 7.5 per cent rise in prescriptions for medication in . a year.","22 per cent admit being preoccupied with everyday worries, poll says .

Tara the cat has drawn more than 20million views on YouTube, tossed the first pitch at a baseball game, and now California's heroic feline is getting her own holiday. Last week, the Bakersfield Board of Supervisors proclaimed June 3 Tara the Hero Cat Day to honor  Erica and Roger Triantafilo' furry friend for valiantly saving their 4-year-old son from a vicious dog. On Tuesday, the Traintfilos arrived at the Kern County Board of Supervisors chambers in Bakersfield for the ceremony with Tara in tow on a leash. Scroll down for video - WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Cat of the hour: Tara the cat is held by Roger Triantafilo while he gives a few words of thanks to the Kern County Board of Supervisors in Bakersfield, California, after the board proclaimed Tuesday as Tara the Hero Cat Day in Kern County . Purr-fect day: Tara, seen on a leash with her owners and their 4-year-old son, Jeremy, received a certificate and some cat toys for her bravery . Cat's clan: The Bakersfield family were recognized for representing their hometown with composure and kindheartedness . Town officials presented the family with a certificate of recognition and threw in some toys for the four-legged hero. Tara's owners said they were overwhelmed by the community's response to the now-viral video showing the fearless kitty coming to the rescue of their son, Jeremy. ‘To have this recognition is unreal. We're proud to be a part of this community. Kern County is our home and we love it,’ Roger Triantafilo told Bakersfield Now. Some star-struck Bakersfield supervisors even asked to pose for selfies with the cat of the hour, who did not appear bothered by all the attention. For the humble whiskered hero, this was only the latest in a series of honors. On May 20, the tabby threw the first pitch at a Bakersfield Blaze home game at Same Lynn Ballpark. She was carried onto the pitch by Roger Triantafilo, accompanied by his son, Jeremy, who she saved from the dog attack, and his wife, Erica.

Claw blimey: Tara, with Roger Triantafilo, leaves with son Jeremy (left) and mom Erica after throwing the ceremonial first pitch . Cat's amazing: The famous feline was the star attraction on Tuesday at the Bakersfield Blaze home game . Tara, however, didn’t quite play ball. Organizers had provided a baseball attached to a piece of string for the ceremonial first pitch, but . she wasn’t very interested in swatting it. Three days later, Tara made an appearance at the Bakersfield Condors hockey game and dropped the puck with the help of her owners. Three weeks ago, she became the nation's most beloved cat when surveillance . footage emerged showing her saving Jeremy by pouncing on the . neighbor's dog as it attacked him. Tara's owners said she has been best friends with Jeremy since he was born. She followed Erica and Roger Triantafilo home from a park about six years ago and has been a member of the family ever since, they said. 'It's pretty amazing to see just a cat . take on a dog and selflessly put herself out there,' Roger Triantafilo said. 'That dog did not . even know what hit him.' Erica explained that she had been near to the house watering a tree when the neighbor's dog, an eight-month-old male Labrador-Chow mix, escaped and grabbed her son by the leg. 'I'd never seen a dog just shake a child like that so violently,' she said. 'I just remember hearing him and the next thing I know, I see my cat flying out of nowhere and getting to this dog.' Loved: The cat happily lets the little boy kiss her as he calls her a hero who saved him from a 'mean dog' After the attack, Tara can be seen chasing the dog away before returning to Jeremy's side. In an interview with the Bakersfield Californian, . his family said she had always been protective over their oldest child . and slept in his crib when he was a baby. They also have younger twin . boys. They added that Tara became part of the family in 2008 when she followed them home from a nearby park - and they accepted her into their home, even though Erica is allergic to cats. She 'really just adopted us from there,' Mrs Triantafilo said. They named her Tara after 'Zatara', which was the name given to Edmond Dantes in The Count of Monte Cristo by smugglers. They told him it means driftwood. 'We named her driftwood because she's our little cat that followed us home,' Triantafilo said. 'She's our little driftwood. She's amazing.' She said that even though her three boys tug at Tara, she sits there and takes it. Lurking: Jeremy Triantafilo was outside his family's home when a neighbor's dog escaped and ran towards him . To the rescue! Tara runs towards her owner as Scrappy shakes him. The dog was euthanized after continuing to show aggression during a 10-day assessment . 'She's the most mellow cat you've ever seen,' she told Today. 'All our boys love her... and she loves them right back.' The video had shown . Jeremy sitting on his bicycle outside his family's home on Tuesday when . the dog escaped its home through an open gate and crept up on him from . behind. Surveillance footage, which Jeremy's father uploaded to YouTube, shows the dog grabbing the boy's leg and pulling him to the ground before violently shaking him with his teeth clamped tight. Then suddenly, an unlikely hero bounds towards him - the family's cat, Tara. The . video shows the fearless feline jumping on the dog with enough force to . push him away from the boy. Tara then chases the dog away from the . driveway with its leg between its tail. Feline brave: The cat launches herself at the startled dog and knocks it away from Jeremy . And don't come back! Tara follows the dog to make sure it has left, before returning to check on Jeremy . The neighbor, who had been pulling out of their gated driveway when the dog escaped, called 911 for the boy and his mother, KERO reported. The boy, who has mild autism, needed stitches to the deep wounds on his legs but is otherwise fine. 'He's just bouncing back from this,' she told Today. 'He . tells us it feels better.' Speaking to Kero, he said: 'Tara is my hero!' The dog was taken by Bakersfield Animal Control and was later put down. Injuries: Jeremy needed stitches to the wounds on his leg, pictured, but is otherwise fine, his mother said . Relief: Jeremy's parents, Erica and Roger, pictured, said they were relieved his injuries were not worse . The . encounter was caught on surveillance cameras outside the home and . uploaded to YouTube by the boy's father. 'My cat . defends my son during a vicious dog attack and runs the dog off before . he can do additional damage,' Triantafilo wrote beneath the video. 'Thankfully, my son is fine!' The . boy's mother said on Facebook: 'We aren't upset with our neighbors, . we're just thankful our son wasn't injured more... Our cat is my hero!' 'Whoever said cats don't love their owners!' one YouTube viewer said.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A homeless man who tried to kill himself by jumping in front of a train has been prosecuted for trespassing. Depressed Peter Anderson, 38, tried to commit suicide by jumping in front of a train at Leigh railway station in Southend on May 15, but was stopped by police. The Crown Prosecution Service then decided to prosecute Anderson, of no fixed abode, for trespass, a charge he admitted at Southend Magistrates’ Court. Depressed: Peter Anderson tried to commit suicide at Leigh train station in Southend, but was stopped by police . However, concerns have been raised over whether Anderson, who was given a three-month conditional discharge for the crime, should have been prosecuted in the first place. His friend Danny Salmon, 31, from Shoebury, said: ‘This was a cry for help. ‘But all that has happened up until now is he has been given drugs by doctors and pulled up in court rather than talked to or sent to something like rehab and given the help he so desperately needs. ‘It seems like a waste of taxpayer money especially as the clear answer is to give him help.’ n court, Anderson’s solicitor Ann Blyth-Cook, explained why her client had tried to take his own life. She said: ‘My client has fallen on hard times. ‘He has been out of work for some time now since losing his driving licence and because he cannot read or write he has struggled to find a new job. Legal action: The Crown Prosecution Service decided to prosecute Anderson, of no fixed abode, for trespass, a charge he admitted at Southend Magistrates' Court (pictured) ‘This incident was a cry for help and he needs support to get back on the mend.’ Before sentencing him, chairman of the bench, Roger Harbidge, said: ‘I wish I had a box of tricks and could pull something out for you, but miracles take much longer. ‘What I would say to you is talk to the probation service because they have certain things you can try in terms of finding literacy courses and helping with finances. ‘I really do hope you can find something or someone who can help you out.’ A spokeswoman for the CPS said the prosecution was in the public interest. She said: ‘In this case, due to the fact the defendant was on prohibited land, namely train tracks, and by his doing so could harm or cause distress to other members of the public and/or their safety it is clear that it was in the public interest to proceed. ‘This course of action we hope would also deter anyone else from acting in the same manner in the future, which is dangerous and could potentially endanger lives. The safety of the defendant or anyone on or in the proximity of train tracks is paramount. ‘The court process will always seek to identify any further help or support the defendant in a case such as this may need which they may not have received otherwise.’","Peter Anderson tried to commit suicide at Leigh train station in Southend .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A defiant restaurant owner in Alaska refused to let a little flooding stand between his customers and an order of Thai ribs and fried rice. Anuson 'Knott' Poolsawat, owner of Knott's Take Out in North Pole, forded the swollen waters of Clear Creek to reach two customers stranded along the Richardson Highway. Mike Laiti and Brandon Borgens were completing a multi-day drive Saturday night up the Alaska Highway when they called in their order to the restaurant, which was near closing. Rain or shine: Anuson 'Knott' Poolsawat, owner of Knott's Take Out in North Pole, Alaska, forded the swollen waters of Clear Creek to reach two customers waiting for a takeout order . Precious cargo: Poolsawat held the takeout boxes over his head so as not to get an order of Thai barbecue ribs, Thai fried rice and a hard-boiled sweet 'dinosaur egg' soggy . Unstoppable: Poolsawat drove more than 25 miles to reach two customers who had ordered food from him but were unable to pick it up because of a sinkhole . As they approached Clear Creek, they learned a sinkhole had developed from heavy rain near the creek. The state Department of Transportation closed the bridge. Laiti called Poolsawat to cancel their order at the restaurant more than 25 miles away in North Pole. 'I called him and said, ""Hey man, I can't make it,"" and he said, ""Not a problem, I'll come cross the waters,""' Laiti told Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. 'He called me and said, ""Should I bring a boat?""' Poolsawat arrived with takeout boxes containing Thai barbecue ribs for $13 and Thai fried rice. Another box held a 'dinosaur egg' — a hardboiled egg that's fried and covered in a sweet sesame sauce. Poolsawat hiked up his shorts and waded through the creek, holding the takeout boxes over his head. The frigid water was hip-deep. Poolsawat had already done them a favor by staying open late, Laiti said. The delivery was beyond expectations. 'He'd help anybody out. He's just a really good positive attitude, just a good guy,' said Laiti. 'He's definitely a goofball character and the food he makes is great.' Above and beyond: Poolsawat hiked up his shorts and waded through the creek filled with frigid water that reached his hips . Satisfied customer: Mike Laiti (pictured on Poolsawat's back left), one of the two men who ordered takeout from Knott's Saturday, said that the delivery was beyond his expectations . The two friends later posed for a hilarious Facebook selfie, with 'Knott' dressed in a Superman T-shirt giving Laiti a piggyback ride outside his takeout joint. Poolsawat's waterlogged heroics, which have been covered by both local and national media, have been very good for business. On the restaurant’s Facebook page, the moustachioed owner has repeatedly boasted about having to go into town to resupply after selling out of most of the items on the menu. He has been using the social media forum to keep his customers abreast with the availability of his Thai favorites, which have been selling like hotcakes since the now-notorious delivery. Ironic: on Tuesday, it was Poolsawat and his friends who were in need of rescue after they became stranded with their pickup truck . In an ironic twist of fate, on Tuesday it was Poolsawat himself who was in need of rescue when he became stranded outside North Pole with two friends and a dog. Poolsawat posted a status update asking anyone with a four-wheel drive to come and pull their pickup truck from the riverbank.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . and Chris Brooke . A British woman suffered appalling injuries after falling 50ft from the window of  her Spanish hotel while sleepwalking. Amy Wigfull, 24, has been on life support in hospital since the accident during a family holiday in Malaga. She wandered into the bathroom in her sleep and tumbled through a large window. Doctors believe she only survived because her body was so relaxed. Tragic accident: Amy Wigfull, 24, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, is on life support after falling 50ft from a hotel window while sleepwalking. Above, Ms Wigfull is pictured in a Spanish hospital with a male companion . She suffered fractures to her spine, pelvis, ribs and shoulders, as well as a punctured lung and bleeding on the brain. Despite . the seriousness of her injuries, she is not paralysed, has movement in . her limbs and is conscious. However she is likely to need at least four . operations. Miss Wigfull, a . shop display designer, did not have travel insurance but did have a . European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), which entitles her to free or . reduced-cost treatment. But . precisely when patients are required to start paying remains a grey . area, and her family have been told they may have to contribute up to 30 . per cent of her £16,000 care costs. They . have started fund-raising as a result, and will at least have to pay . for the air ambulance to take her home to Sheffield, as this is not . covered by the EHIC. Merchandising designer: Ms Wigfull was on a family holiday in Malaga when she plunged from the fifth floor. She suffered a broken back, fractured pelvis, broken ribs, and punctured lung, as well as bleeding on the brain . Resort: Ms Wigfull, who is a merchandising display designer at a fashion store, had been in Malaga as part of a 14-strong party of women celebrating her mother Shelley and cousin Clare Duffy's 40th birthdays (file picture) Miss . Wigfull was with 13 female family members staying at the four star . Benalmadena Palace Hotel to celebrate the 40th birthdays of her mother . and aunt. Toxicology tests proved she was not under the influence of drugs or drink when she fell from the fifth floor at 2am on Sunday. Her . cousin Clare Duffy, 40, said yesterday: ‘We are devastated but we know . she is lucky to be alive. We can’t believe she has survived. We think . the fact she was asleep has saved her life. She fell gracefully and . wasn’t trying to stop herself from falling.’ She . is being looked after in Hospital Universitario Virgen De La Victoria, . where she is on a ventilator because of her punctured lung. She could be . in hospital for several months. Falll: She is on a life support machine in a Spanish hospital following the accident at around 2am on Sunday . Ms Duffy said: 'People will say ""why wasn't she insured? It was her own fault."" The fact of the matter is she wasn't insured, she wasn't drinking, it was just an awful accident. 'Any parent would be devastated if it happened to their child. We have got to raise some money to get Amy home and to get the operations she needs. 'Her mum is in Malaga with her. We think she can actually get some money back with the European health card but there will be a massive shortfall. Fundraising effort: Ms Wigfull has no holiday insurance and her family are trying to raise 20,000 euros to fly her back to her home in Sheffield . 'Apparantly Spanish citizens don't get the rights we get on the NHS, they get about 70 or 80 per cent of the costs but there will still be a huge shortfall. We have no idea what the final bill will be. 'We are not thinking about that, we just want her to get better and back home but its going to be a long period of recovery. Because she has punctured her lung she is still on a ventilator. 'As soon as she is fit to have the operations they will assess it from there. Doctors have said it could be four weeks but it could be four months, we just don't know. 'A friend has started a giving page on Facebook. We are absolutely overwhelmed by friends and people who don't even know her giving money, it's already up to £3,500. 'They are obviously aware that Amy should have had insurance but they just want to help, we are hoping that money will go towards the shortfall. 'We were insured but for whatever reason Amy wasn't but she might have thought she didn't need it because it was a short break but we all know you do.' She added: 'We weren't on a holiday where we were going on jet skis or hiring motorbikes where you hear most of the fatalities are abroad. It was a family get together and it ended up like this.' Ms Wilgfull, whose boyfriend Andy is flying out to be at her bedside, is believed to need at least four operations, at a cost of 10,000 euros each. She is being treated as Spanish citizen in the Universitario Virgen De La Victoria Hospital in Malaga. Because of this, she will have to find up to 30 per cent of the price - and she then faces the cost of an air ambulance back to the UK. Family and friends are also raising money for living costs so that her mother can stay with her. A . British Consulate official in Malaga said last night that she should . not have to pay for her care, adding: ‘If there are problems, she should . contact us.’ To donate to Amy's fund, visit: www.indiegogo.com/projects/amy-chester.","Amy Wigfull, 24, fell 50ft from a hotel window while she was sleepwalking .

But a university student from Texas has ensured Let It Go from Frozen will resonate with cartoon fans of all ages by singing it in the voices of 21 different Disney and Pixar characters from almost every classic film. Brian Hull, a 22-year-old vocal performance major from Dallas Baptist University, impersonates classic characters such as Winnie the Pooh, Mickey Mouse, Sebastian from The Little Mermaid, Lumiere from Beauty and The Beast, and Scar from The Lion King. Scroll down for video . Brian Hull recorded himself singing Let It Go in the voice of 21 different Disney and Pixar characters, including Billy Crystal's character Mike Wazowski from Monsters Inc . He also belts out the hit song as more recent Disney favourites, including Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise, Dug and Alpha from Up, and Ray from The Princess And The Frog. Mr Hull produced the video, which has already wracked up more than 1.4 million YouTube plays at the time of writing, in order to win a $100 gift card in a competition. Experts suggest his popular video will have already earned Mr Hull more than $1000 from YouTube, with that number only expected to increase. He told examiner.com that the virality of his video is completely unexpected. ‘The night before I submitted my video, I was having second thoughts about how good it was, so I posted it to my Facebook, just so I could get honest feedback from my friends. The next thing I know, they shared it over 200 times and now, the video has over a half million views in a day and a half,’ he said.

It also made it to the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, the first Disney song to do so since 1995 when Colors of the Wind from Pocahontas reached number four on the chart. Mr Hull hopes that his video not only wins the competition, but also reminds people of the Disney classics. He wrote on his YouTube page: ‘With so many covers of Let it Go coming out, people may forget the original Disney magic that this song has, so what better way to preserve that magic (than) with other Disney and Pixar characters singing the song!’ Idina Menzel performs Let It Go at the Oscars earlier this month.

"By . Jill Reilly . Egypt is facing threats to its aid payments and a tourism boycott amid international outrage over the jailing of three foreign journalists yesterday. Sentences of between seven and ten years were handed to the trio for ‘spreading false news’ in reports for Qatar-based Al Jazeera that were deemed too sympathetic to former elected president Mohammed Morsi, who was ousted by the military last year. David Cameron said that he was ‘completely appalled’ by the verdicts against former BBC correspondent Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, while Foreign Secretary William Hague summoned the Egyptian ambassador in London for crisis talks. Scroll down for video . An Egyptian court has sentenced three journalists to seven years in prison each on terrorism-related charges.

Australian journalist Peter Greste (left) and Canadian-Egyptian journalist Mohammed Fahmy (right) hold on to each other as they listen to the proceedings . The trio were accused of supporting Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which the authorities have declared a terrorist organisation . The three were arrested in December as part of a sweeping crackdown on Islamist supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi. The trio were accused of supporting Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which the authorities have declared a terrorist organisation. They also faced charges of fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's national security and make it appear the country was facing civil war. The prosecution offered little evidence to back up the charges against them. The journalists and their supporters have said they were simply doing their jobs, covering the wave of protests led by the Brotherhood against the military-backed government installed after Morsi was ousted on July 3 by then-army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who is now the president.

The police crackdown on the protests has killed hundreds and put thousands more in prison. 'I swear they will pay for this,' Fahmy shouted angrily from the defendants' cage after the sentences were announced. Greste raised his fists in the air. 'They just ruined a family,' said Fahmy's brother Adel, who was attending the session. He said they would appeal against the verdict but added that he had little faith in the system. 'Everything is corrupt,' he said. The judge also handed 10-year sentences to two British journalists and a Dutch journalist who were not in Egypt and were being tried in absentia. Al-Jazeera English producer Baher Mohamed, centre left, Canadian-Egyptian acting Cairo bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy, centre, and correspondent Peter Greste, second right, appear in court in March . Two defendants among 14 others on trial in the case were acquitted, including the son of Mohammed el-Beltagy, a senior figure in the Muslim Brotherhood. British ambassador James Watt, who was in court, said he was 'very disappointed' by the verdict. 'Freedom of expression is fundamental to any democracy,' he said. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, speaking on a visit to Cairo, described the sentencing as ‘chilling and draconian’. Conservative MPs called for an urgent review of UK and EU aid payments to Egypt. There were similar calls in the US, which has just handed Cairo a huge slice of foreign aid. Tory Peter Bone said: ‘It’s fundamentally wrong to give taxpayers’ money to corrupt foreign governments that are imprisoning people for reporting facts. The Arab Spring is turning into a disaster.’ The other defendants were mainly students, arrested separately, accused of providing the Al Jazeera journalists with footage along with a variety of other charges, including belonging to the Brotherhood. The latest official figures show that the UK gave £8.4 million to Egypt in 2012, mostly through the Foreign Office. But Britain also contributes to a £4.2 billion EU aid package that was agreed in 2012 . However, MPs also warned that, following the Leveson Inquiry, proposals for a form of state regulation of the British press made it more difficult for this country to lecture others about media freedoms.

The images, taken at the INAA Scottish Hair and Beauty Awards at a luxury Thistle hotel in Glasgow, appear to show Ruthanne Reid strike the guest's face with her forehead - moments after another guest had exposed her rear. But Mrs Reid, 57, strenuously denies the assault, which came after she also appeared march down a catwalk set up on the stage towards the . audience and seemingly hit someone with her handbag. Scroll down for video . Impact: This picture shows the moment a woman is apparently on the receiving end of a headbutt at an awards ceremony in Glasagow . Ruthanne Reid (in blue dress), 57, was caught on camera at a hairdressing awards ceremony apparently headbutting one guest . The woman reels backward as a group of women behind react with shock at the incident . She said: 'There was all this pushing and shoving and people were all around about me. I don't know. 'They said I head-butted somebody but I wouldn't. 'I was swaying, because I was being held from behind and I was pushed into her. 'It was never a head-butt. The woman is a good friend of my daughter, why on earth would I try and do that to her?' The awards ceremony, which had billed itself as a 'showcase' for the beauty industry, and included guests such as actress Michelle Keegan and Miss Scotland Ellie McKeating, began to unravel when presenter Nimrod Kamer announced the wrong name for an award. Ruthanne Reid said: 'It was never a head-butt. The woman is a good friend of my daughter, why on earth would I try and do that to her?' Peacemaker? The woman in red appears to be trying to calm down the event organiser . Mrs Reid said: 'We . had Nimrod from Russia Today and he picked up the award cards from . earlier that had been left on the podium rather than taking the card . that came with the award. 'He called out the wrong name, and on the . projector screen was the Esteem Beauty and instead he called out Cruz, . who had already received their award earlier.' Not willing to allow the award to be . given unjustly, Ms Reid said she took to the stage to point out the . mistake and make amends. 'I shouldn't have done it, I don't know why I did it but I just . felt it was unfair as the right person hadn't been called out,' she said. Ms Reid said the unfortunate incident scuffle was down to a presenter calling out the wrong winner . Glammed up: 26-year-old Ms Campbell (pictured left and right) exposed her rear at Ms Reid during the event . 'So I . went on stage and said ""I'm really really sorry, there's been a mistake, . could Cruz go off as you have not won, the rightful winners are Esteem . Beauty"". 'There was a bit of booing, as the audience by that . point were a bit rankled, to say the least, but the girl from Esteem . came up and took the award so it was fine.' However, female guest Kerry Campbell, 26, then ran up on stage, swore and exposed her rear. Farce: Guests at the event said that Ms Reid had been drunk, and that the ceremony had descended into farce . Ms Reid said: 'I went on stage again to say that we hadn't completed the raffle . but the mics went dead, and just at that moment a girl from Dundee came . up on stage and put her fingers in my face. 'Then she did a moonie directed at me and I said ""well that's very lady like"", to which she ran back and tried to attack me. 'I . tried to signal to the team to put the mics back on so I could complete . the raffle, but people in the audience thought that I was going after . the girl. 'They all came on stage and tried to hold me, they were all my friends, they misinterpreted the situation.' Ms Reid said the crowd then became rowdy. In the video clip Ms Reid is seen being restrained by a security guard. She said: 'I started to resist as they were all . pulling and shoving at me, and the next thing I know I'm being carried . by security guards outside. 'To this moment I still haven't got any idea why that happened, and it must have looked so bad to everybody.' She denied she had been drunk, and explained she was not wearing shoes because she had broken her toes. 'I was running about in my bare feet all night . because I'd broken my toes while moving boxes at home, and I couldn't . get my shoes on,' she said. 'When I went up and did my speech I actually . apologised and said to everyone why I was barefoot, as the only shoes I . could get into were tennis shoes. Overshadowed: Ms Reid, who lives in Paisley, said she had spent four months planning the event with her daughter Joanne, only for the evening to be overshadowed by allegations of assault . 'I did have a drink that . night. I'd had two half glasses of wine at most, that was all. 'I . certainly wasn't drunk like they're making out. I didn't have the time . to get drunk. 'The next day I felt as though I'd had a nervous . breakdown. I have been on stress medication for some time and I feel . that the night was just the final tip for it.' Ms . Reid today sent an apology to those who attended the event for her . behaviour, which she put down to the wrong name being called out by . presenters, and announced that she had resigned from the INAA. 'I am writing to express my sincerest apologies for my insensitive actions and behaviour on Sunday evening,' she wrote. 'Having . spent four months on the planning and preparation it was highly . embarrassing for the wrong name to be called out on stage. 'I . can only imagine the distress caused to Cruz for which I apologise most . profusely. I will of course accept that I have caused irreparable . damage and have therefore resigned from INAA.' Police were eventually called to the event, although no arrests were made. More than 800 . guests had attended the £105-a-ticket event on Sunday evening, among . them former Coronation Street actress Keegan and her fiance, ex-The Only . Way Is Essex star Mark Wright, Miss McKeating and the Lord Provost of Glasgow, Sadie Docherty. Another attendee, Ashley Hutton, 37, who . owns a salon in Dundee, claimed Ms Reid appeared to be drunk and as the . event neared its close had come on stage, taken hold of the microphone . and yelled at the audience. Mrs Hutton told Stv: . 'Ruthanne was very drunk and ended up screaming at everyone in the . crowd for no reason. Before that even happened you would tell people . were getting annoyed and agitated. She added: 'Then all of a . sudden she stormed off stage and started swinging her bag at people and . then ended up headbutting a guest. Security got involved, it was just a . farce.' Venue: Around 800 guests attended the £105-a-ticket awards ceremony at the Thistle hotel . Exposed: While Ms Reid, who organised the event with daughter Joanne, was on stage, female guest Kerry Campbell was filmed swearing at her, before pulling up her dress (left) and exposing her bottom (right) Chaos: Ms Reid, pictured on stage, claimed Ms Campbell 'did a moonie' before allegedly trying to attack her . Apology: Ms Reid sent this apology to attendees of the event, saying she had resigned from sponsors INAA . Guests: Former Coronation Street star Michell Keegan was in the audience for the prestigious awards ceremony . Mrs Hutton said . Miss Scotland's crown had been knocked off in the fracas, and said she . was embarrassed to have attended the event. 'People put a lot of time and effort into the awards and paid over £100 for a tickets, but it was just a disaster,' she said. Gayle Leggatt, 30, who owns Cruz Hair and Beauty in Glasgow, winners of the hair salon of the year at the awards, said that when her salon was announced as the winner, Ms Reid stormed the stage. 'Just as I was about to speak, Ruthanne snatched the mic away,' she told the Daily Record. 'She started bawling about how it wasn’t the right salon that had won.' Ms Reid, who lives in Paisley, said . she had spent four months planning the event with her daughter Joanne and . that she was left in tears as security guards dragged her from the . venue. She added: 'I was really looking forward to the night, like I do every year, . and people had paid good money to go and enjoy themselves, but it just . turned out ridiculous. 'When that awards started everything seemed to be going well, but during one of the sessions things started to go pear-shaped.' A spokesman from Police Scotland told . MailOnline: 'We were called at around 11.45pm on Sunday June 1 to a . report of a disturbance but on arrival there was no evidence that any . crime had been committed and no allegations of assault were made.' A spokesman from the Thistle hotel group said the chain was unable to comment on the incident.","Ruthanne Reid appeared to strike a guest at awards ceremony in Glasgow .

"By . Bryan Keogh . Congressman Charles Rangel is hoping a new biographical rap song will give him an edge in Harlem as he faces a tough primary fight. A YouTube page run by his campaign uploaded a video this weekend featuring unidentified rappers detailing 84-year-old Representative Rangel's biography and urging listeners to vote for the 'superfly, stand-up guy' in the Democratic primary on Tuesday. The beat-heavy track thumps as a campaign poster displays on screen. The catchy chorus of 'Charlie, Charlie, Charlie Rangel' follows such informative lines as 'He was born in Harlem; got a purple heart and bronze star, earned 'em in the Army' and 'at 16 he worked a lot of low paying jobs so he knows what it means to be poor.' Scroll down for video . Congressman Charles Rangel greets a supporter before a graduation ceremony in New York today, hours after he posted a rap song about his life to YouTube . How much it help his chances is unclear. The video, posted by 'rangel4congress', has garnered only 301 hits so far, many of whom are likely bored political reporters. The Week calls the song 'Incredibly, not bad.' The race appeared to be widening in the Congressman's favor as New Yorkers prepared to cast their ballots. An NY1/Siena College poll of likely primary voters gave Representative Rangel a comfortable 13 point lead  over his main challenger New York state Senator Adriano Espaillat, 47 per cent to 34 per cent. Race has become a major issue in the contest. Representative Rangel is one of the most recognizable members of the Congressional Black Caucus, while Senator Espaillat is hoping his roots help him in the increasingly Hispanic district. If he wins, he would become the first Dominican-born member of Congress. Representative Rangel raised eyebrows when he asked in one debate, 'Just what the heck . has he done besides saying he's a Dominican?' The Congressman on Saturday said he's not overconfident he'll . prevail over Senator Espaillat but insisted that voters would stick . with a veteran lawmaker, dismissing criticism that he was too old to . continue serving in Washington, according to the AP. 'If . you had a racehorse that won 43 races, brings in the money, but the . horse is old and experienced and knows the track — what would you do?' Representative Rangel asked reporters at a Washington Heights storefront . church, where he was endorsed by about a dozen Spanish-speaking . ministers. 'Would you send him to the glue factory? Hell no.'","The three-minute rap features a chorus chanting 'Charlie, Charlie, Charlie Rangel' and includes lines like 'got a purple heart and bronze star, earned 'em in the Army'

"By . Ted Thornhill . A family are devastated after their 'perfect' dog died after a routine castration was botched by vets. Shadow, a six-year-old Newfoundland, went under the knife after being diagnosed with a benign tumour in his testicles. But the poorly pet died from internal bleeding just two hours after being sent home, when an essential internal ligature was not put in place, according to a post-mortem. Tragedy: Shadow, a six-year-old Newfoundland, died from internal bleeding following a routine operation. He's pictured on the right with owner Gary Ballantyne . Heartbroken owner Gemma Ballantyne, 22, is now demanding answers from the Companion Care practice inside the Pets at Home store in Slough, Berkshire. Gemma, a receptionist, said: 'We were told it was just routine and nothing to worry about. 'At 2pm that day, I got a call from the vet, who told me that the operation went well and we could pick him up. 'When I got there after work at about 6pm, Shadow was laid on the floor, completely out of it. Shock: Shadow with owner Gemma Ballantyne, who spoke of her devastation at her dog's death . 'The vet kept reassuring me he was completely fine, just sleepy, so he put Shadow on a stretcher and put him in the back of my car. 'When I arrived home we had to carry him out of the car, and he was just a fluffy lump. 'He lay on the kitchen floor and didn't move. 'We rang the vet several times, and he kept saying Shadow would be fine. 'I stayed on the floor with him, cuddling up to him and crying because I wanted him to wake up so much. Two hours later he died.' An independent post mortem revealed that Shadow died from internal bleeding when 2.5 litres of blood leaked inside his abdomen. It named vet Rahul Shah as the clinician and said a ligature on Shadow's testicular blood vessels and tubes was not in place. An independent post mortem revealed that  2.5 litres of blood leaked inside Shadow's abdomen . Gemma raised Shadow from a pup with her parents Gary, 54, and Debbie, 49, and siblings Terri, 28, and 25-year-old Chris, at their home in Slough. Tearful Gemma said: 'He was a completely healthy, all he had was a tumour that was benign so we were told he would have to be castrated. 'That night he was dead, and it's all the vet's fault for botching the surgery. 'The post mortem says if he had put these ties around the inside of the wound properly, he would have been fine. 'I wish I had questioned the vet more but he's a qualified vet so you just think that they are right. 'We are all devastated, he was such a great dog just full of life. 'He was a bit of a bull in a china shop because he thought he was tiny, so he would sit on us and crush us. 'You couldn't ask for a better pet, friend and companion - he was perfect.' Loved: Mrs Ballantyne said that Shadow was the perfect pet . The post mortem was carried out at the Royal Veterinary College in North Mimms, Hertfordshire. The official report by independent veterinary pathologists reads: 'There was evidence of significant abdominal haemorrhage. 'The quantity of bloody fluid in the abdomen was sufficient to cause the death of this animal and appears to have come from the left spermatic cord where the ligature was not in place.' Other documentation shows the practice also failed to monitor the dog's post-op recovery every 15 minutes until he was 'fully awake.' Gemma paid £200 for the operation which took place on Friday June 20 and had the money refunded. She added: 'Shadow's death was down to human error and internal bleeding in the abdomen. 'The vets paid for the post mortem and have offered to pay for his cremation, which makes them look guilty. 'If they knew they weren't at fault, they wouldn't bother, would they? 'Mr Shah himself has just been blasé about everything, which is even more annoying because if it was me, I don't think I could even touch another animal after that. 'He has just showed no remorse at all, no compassion and it's ridiculous. 'I don't want him to be able to go near another animal ever again because no one should have to go through what we went through. 'Nothing will bring Shadow back but we want the vet to know how much he has hurt us and he shouldn't be allowed to operate ever again.' Reaction: The Companion Care practice at Pets at Home in Slough has offered its sympathies to Shadow's owners . The Companion Care practice has a three-and-a-half star review on Facebook with some negative comments from pet owners. One wrote: 'Avoid this place at all costs! Took my dog here three years ago. He was so ill but diagnosed with an upset stomach and sent home but died the next day!' Companion Care said: 'The loss of a much loved pet is tragic in any circumstances and we extend our deepest sympathy to Shadow's family. 'With the agreement of Shadow's owners we arranged for a post mortem examination by an independent veterinary surgeon at the Royal Veterinary College and are investigating the findings in detail with Shadow's owners.

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . A homeless encampment near the Jersey shore that came to be known as Tent City was declared closed after the last of its 120 occupants was placed in temporary housing. The camp's closing was announced Monday by Lakewood town officials and a lawyer who represented the camp's occupants, although the last occupant, Alex Libman, left last Thursday. Protest: A Tent City protester is seen holding a sign on June 2 . Shut down: Officials announced that homeless camp Tent City was closed on Monday . Libman, 32, was arrested at the camp, Police Chief Robert Lawson told the Asbury Park Press. 'Libman told us all along he wanted to go out with a bang,' Lawson said. 'When the final order came from the judge to evict him from Tent City, he laid down, so we carried him out.' Deputy Mayor Albert Akerman told the paper trees may be planted at the camp. 'I think the whole thing was a movement,' he said. 'The movement is over.' Bulldozers seen at the camp on June 24 were called 'heartless metallic beasts' by Tent City's website. Former residents have been provided apartments for at least 10 months and motels for another two as part of a court-sanctioned agreement worked out between them and town officials. Libman refused an apartment, the Park Press said. The Rev. Steve Brigham, an advocate who lived at the camp, said the first residents began camping out in the woods of what would become Tent City in 2003. Last man standing: Alex Libman, seen in this Facebook photo, was arrested when he refused to move out of Tent City . Destroyed: Bulldozers - or what Tent City's website calls 'heartless metallic beasts' - are seen at the campsite . Dismantled: The bulldozer moves through Tent City on June 24 . 'Without a doubt, we brought awareness to the fact that there's homelessness in the suburbs, and a great need for a shelter, and for affordable housing — smaller houses on smaller pieces of land that people can afford on a low-wage job,' Brigham said. 'There still is no shelter in Ocean County; this is a Band-Aid. It's better than getting kicked to the curb with nothing, but it's still a Band-Aid.' Former Tent City resident Tonya Henderson, one of the last to leave, is now in temporary housing and looking for a steady job. 'With a little bad luck, anyone could end up homeless,' she said. 'I am so grateful to be out of the woods and in housing.' The camp began in 2003 but came to the attention of Lakewood officials in 2006. Its residents devised their own bylaws and held elections to choose their own leaders. Among the rules: no drugs, no loud noise and no entering someone else's tent without permission. At least five people died at the camp from fires, illness and exposure over the years. As the camp grew in size, it increasingly grated on the nerves of neighboring residents. It sat across the street from an apartment complex and less than a mile from a popular minor league baseball stadium where a low-level Philadelphia Phillies affiliate plays. Minister: Rev. Steve Brigham of Lakewood's Tent City is seen in this June 2 photo . Help: A sign at Tent City from June 2 asks for land and support . Lakewood and Ocean County officials made various attempts to crack down and evict the camp, and the dispute wound up in court, where a sympathetic judge prodded both sides to reach an accommodation. Under a pact reached in March 2013, camp leaders agreed to close it down once all its residents could be provided with at least a year of housing. Since then, the camp has shrunk as residents slowly moved out. Residents waved signs and protested on June 2, as a cleanup crew began taking down Tent City, the Press reported. They were photographed with signs that read 'Build Before You Bulldoze' and 'Liberty and Justice for all Includes The Homeless,' among others. Multiple rallies and marches were organized throughout the month in hopes of saving Tent City. 'There are several smaller encampments of homeless people in various sites in Ocean County, and advocates are working to find housing for them as well. Akerman was relieved to have the camp gone. 'Today is what we in Lakewood have wanted all along: the official closure date for Tent City with the closing done the right way, by helping these people get housed in a fair and compassionate way,' he said. Attorney Jeffrey Wild, who represented the camp occupants for free for several years, said all parties to the dispute will work toward establishing a permanent homeless shelter in the county.
