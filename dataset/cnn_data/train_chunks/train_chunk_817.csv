"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A surveillance camera  has recorded the horrifying moment that a man was shot dead at point-blank range while he cradled his three-year-old goddaughter in his arms at a Brazilian bakery. The video shows a 17-year-old gunman ride up to the bakery on a bicycle and sneak up beside him before training a semi-automatic handgun at his victim's head and firing. The horrified little girl covers her face and stares at her godfather as the cold-blooded killer unloads two more shots into his body.

Thiago Souza sets his goddaughter down as the gunman takes aim at his head . The little girl covers her face as she stares at the body of her dead godfather, while the 17-year-old killer makes his getaway on a bicycle . The little girl, mercifully, was unharmed. Brazilian R7 news reports that the victim was 26-year-old Thiago André Santos Souza. No reason was given for his cold-blooded murder, which occurred on Saturday in Brazil's Sobradinho region - about 15 miles outside the capital of Brasilia. Police arrested a 17-year-old later in the day. He is charged with murder. Thiago Souza was arriving at the bakery with his fiancee and his young goddaughter when he was killed. It appears that no one at the bakery realized the murderer was there until he killed Thiago Souza. The surveillance video shows him pulling a pistol out of his waistband. He hides it behind his back as he walks up to the victim. After firing the shots, he flees on the bicycle he arrived with.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Richard Spillett . Detectives searching remote countryside as part of their investigation into convicted murderer Christopher Halliwell have found 60 items women's clothing buried in woodland. The 50-year-old taxi driver is serving a life sentence after pleading guilty to murdering Swindon office worker Sian O'Callaghan in 2011. Wiltshire Police have not ruled out that more women may have fallen victim to Halliwell and, a week . ago, they recovered a pair of brown New Look boots that 22-year-old . Miss O'Callaghan was wearing when she was last seen alive leaving a . nightclub in Swindon three years ago. A cardigan found close to a pond near Marlborough, Wiltshire as part of an investigation into convicted murderer Christopher Halliwell . Christopher Halliwell (left) is serving a life sentence after pleading guilty to murdering Swindon office worker Sian O'Callaghan (right) in 2011 . The boots . were found floating in a pond two miles from the village of Ramsbury, . near Marlborough, Wiltshire. Also found in the pond was a shotgun. Since . then, extensive searches of the Hill Drop Lane area have been carried out, . including the use of a specialist dive team from Avon and Somerset and . cadaver dogs from South Wales. Officers . have now begun the task of draining and sieving thousands of litres of . water from the 8ft deep pond to see what might be hidden at the bottom . under several inches of silt. Today . Wiltshire Police revealed they had located up to 60 pieces of women's . clothing buried under two inches of soil in thick woodland about 100 . yards from the pond. In addition they have found a chunky knit cardigan . close to the water. Father-of-three Halliwell also admitted to . police killing Becky Godden, who had disappeared from Swindon a decade earlier, but that confession was ruled inadmissible by a judge . because a top detective had breached his rights. Police have continued to investigate the murder of Miss Godden, who had drifted into drugs and prostitution before her death. Officers found her remains in a field in Eastleach, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire in March 2011 having been led there by Halliwell. Last month they revealed they had found a bone at the Cotswold beauty spot, which belonged to Miss Godden. A police tent near the site where detectives say they have uncovered 60 items of women's clothing . Officers are now draining and sieving thousands of litres of water from the 8ft deep pond to see what might be hidden at the bottom . Detective Chief Inspector Sean Memory, who is leading the investigation into the death of Miss O'Callaghan and Miss Godden, said he was confident the clothing found in the woodland near Marlborough did not belong to Miss O'Callaghan. He said he did not know how long the clothing had been hidden but had been there for 'some time'. 'Someone has made some effort to hide it. There are in excess of 60 items of material, such as a sleeve, a zip or a hood, so it is difficult to say exactly how many items of clothing there are,' Mr Memory said. 'There may be a really innocent explanation and someone may have fly-tipped it. Equally it is really unusual to find women's clothing buried. 'It may genuinely have no significance at all but I am open minded as to why someone would bury clothing.' He added: 'But to me it does seem a very strange location to be burying clothes, given what else we have found here. 'I . am satisfied the clothing does not relate to Sian O'Callaghan but I . don't know what Becky Godden was wearing when she disappeared or exactly . when she disappeared.' A police forensic officer displays the remains of the thick-cut cardigan found buried not far from the pond . Police say all items found at the site of the dig will be sent for forensic testing . Police inquiries had led them to look at areas of water in Ramsbury where they found the boots. They are still missing Miss O'Callaghan's handbag, mobile phone, items of jewellery, as well as the knife Halliwell used to kill her. Wiltshire Police launched a high-profile inquiry when the office worker, who lived with her boyfriend Kevin Reape, failed to return home after a night out. Under the leadership of Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher, Halliwell quickly became a suspect in her abduction and murder. Police inquiries had led them to look at areas of water in Ramsbury where they found the boots . But the repeated failure of Mr Fulcher to caution the father-of-three meant that a judge ruled the confessions to the killing of Miss O'Callaghan and Miss Godden were inadmissible in court because the officer had broken Police and Criminal Evidence Act (Pace) rules. Although he was convicted of Miss O'Callaghan's murder, with no other evidence tying Halliwell to the murder of Miss Godden, the prosecution did not oppose an application by his defence team to dismiss the charge. In January this year, Mr Fulcher was found guilty by an independent panel of two counts of gross misconduct and handed a final written warning as punishment. Last week it emerged he had resigned from Wiltshire Police, but the announcement with this breakthrough in the inquiry was not linked.","Police dig in woodland in investigation into murderer Christopher Halliwell .

"By . Sam Webb . A family of birds has set up home in a most unusual location - a Midland hotel's cigarette bin. The blue tits have snubbed the traditional hedges and trees for a nesting site that’s filled with discarded cigarette butts at Fairlawns Hotel, Aldridge, near Walsall in the West Midlands. Guests enjoying a smoke at the venue have been able to enjoy a bit of birdwatching as tiny birds fly in and out of holes on the bin. Although it seems like a bizarre nesting site, it’s secure, warm and filled with filters that act as insulation - the perfect place for a bird to make a home. Keep the home fire burning: A family of blue tits have made their home in a cigarette bin at a hotel . Hotel staff are keenly awaiting the chicks' emergence from the bin. A sign has been placed on the metal container to warn smokers that the birds are nesting inside . The management are so enamoured with their new feathered friends, who arrived two weeks ago, they've taken the bin out of action to ensure the family is not disturbed. A sign has been placed on the metal container to warn smokers that the birds are nesting inside and butts should not be binned. Now hotel staff are keenly awaiting the chicks' emergence from the bin. Hotel deputy manager Neil Wyatt said: 'The bin is only waist high, so we were very surprised the blue tits chose it for a home. Peek-a-boo: One of the birds peers at the camera as it emerges from the bin .

The birds' new home is located outside a conference room at the hotel . 'We first noticed they were flying in and out two weeks ago. Since then, they’ve been very busy. 'They’ve been taking food inside, so we know there’s young in there. It’s just a case of waiting for them to come out - hopefully, without a nicotine addiction.' It’s not the first time that birds have set-up home in an oversized ashtray. Last year a pair of great tits took over a cigarette bin at a restaurant in Yoxall, Staffordshire. Meanwhile, Severn Trent Construction workers were in a flap after a 40 tonne crawler crane was forced to stop work due to nesting birds spotted inside the machinery. An eagle-eyed team worker noticed the new born chicks while working on recent sewage improvements in Rainsworth, Nottinghamshire, and have since been called to stand down. Protected under the Countryside and Wildlife Act, the five baby Pied Wagtails are seen safely tucked away underneath the the crane's giant frame. Since being spotted back in April, the chicks are now being closely monitored. Construction workers were forced to stop work due to nesting birds spotted inside the machinery .

"By . James  Nye . A $60 million high school football stadium that opened to massive fanfare in 2012 will be shut down for the upcoming season after cracks were found in the building's concrete concourse. Administrators in Allen, Texas, northeast of Dallas, had hoped to have Eagle Stadium ready for this fall's games, but said further inspections found the structural problems will need significant repair. They insist the architectural firm and construction company will fund any repairs. The district said Tuesday that both companies had offered $1 million each to allow repairs to begin, but that their insurance companies refused to make the payments. Eagle Stadium at Allen High School:  One of the most expensive high school football stadiums in the United States will close because of structural defects . 'Our commitment to Allen students and taxpayers remains firm that the stadium be repaired properly at the expense of those responsible for the failure: the architect and the builder,' superintendent Lance Hindt said in a statement. Allen taxpayers approved a $119 million bond issue that included funding for the 18,000-seat stadium, with a high-definition video board, a second deck on one sideline and vendor stands hawking Chick-fil-A and Texas barbeque. The facility is the flashiest example of the grandeur of high school football in Texas, where the 'Friday Night Lights' have been glamorized in books, movies and television. But the district had to close the stadium in February after extensive cracks were discovered in the concourse. An outside consulting firm hired by the district has found further building code violations, including parts of the stadium where seating capacity exceeds the legal maximum by more than 70 percent. Closure: The scoreboard is shown at Eagle Stadium at Allen High School in Allen, Texas. The $60 million high school football stadium that opened to massive fanfare in 2012 will be shut down for the upcoming season after cracks were found in the building's concrete concourse . Fixing structural problems at Allen Eagle stadium may require demolishing major components, possibly in areas that include the athletic field, a preliminary forensics report says . Administrators in Allen, Texas, northeast of Dallas, had hoped to have Eagle Stadium ready for this fall's games, but said further inspections found the structural problems will need significant repair. They insist the architectural firm and construction company will fund any repairs . Allen, which won the Class 5A Division I state championship last year, will not sell football season tickets this year. It will host three 'home' games at two stadiums in neighboring Plano and switch two other home games to road games. The $60 million stadium has developed cracks of nearly an inch wide in the concrete of its elevated concourse that could make it unsafe, the school district said this week. The Allen Eagles football team won their division last year in statewide competition. 'It is unacceptable. Our students, families, and the entire community have always supported the district and our commitment to them is to make sure this issue is appropriately resolved,' Beth Nichols, the interim school superintendent, said in a statement on Thursday. The eye-popping price for the 18,000-seater stadium that includes a $1.3 million scoreboard, was financed as part of a voter-approved $119 million bond package. A full inspection and review by an outside engineering and consulting firm is expected to be completed by June. 'It's a big deal when you spend that much money and something goes wrong that quickly,' said Rob Richey, who lives in Allen and has two children attending school in the district.","Eagle Stadium, in Allen, Texas, northeast of Dallas to close for 2014 season after dangerous cracks were discovered in the structure .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 36-year-old woman has been charged with drink-driving an SUV owned by Toronto's crack-smoking mayor Rob Ford. The mayor's black Cadillac Escalada was impounded for seven days following the alleged impaired driving incident on Tuesday. The woman charged with drink-driving has been identified as Lee Anne McRobb, who is understood to have been staying in the same rehab facility as the mayor, the Toronto Sun has reported. A woman has been charged with drink-driving an SUV belonging to Toronto's crack-smoking mayor Rob Ford . The woman charged with drink-driving has been identified as Lee Anne McRobb, who is understood to have been staying in the same rehab facility as the mayor . Sources told the paper she had been in the GreeneStone Muskoka treatment centre. She refused to tell reporters at Northland Towing and Recovery, in Gravenhurst, on Wednesday why she was driving the mayor's car. In one of two videos posted to YouTube by MooseFM's Carly Verhoeven, McRobb appears to say that she had spent time in the facility. When asked why she was driving the car she said: 'It doesn't matter. That's for me to know. You guys don't need to know.' Police confirmed yesterday that McRobb had permission to use the vehicle from its registered owner, CBCNews Toronto has reported. Police would not comment on the identity of the vehicle's owner. Rooms at GreeneStone have fireplaces, Jacuzzi tubs, balconies, patios and views of either woodlands or the Sunset Bay on Lake Muskoka . McRobb is due to appear in court in Bracebridge on June 17. Ford's lawyer confirmed last week that he is still undergoing treatment for his addiction problems, though he would not confirm where he was being treated. Ford's lawyer Dennis Morris told the Toronto Sun he had not heard of McRobb before. Ford has taken a leave of absence and paused his re-election campaign since last month in a bid to treat his alcoholism. His step away from the mayor's office followed the emergence of a new video allegedly showing him smoking crack. Ford (pictured in November 2013) has taken a leave of absence and paused his re-election campaign since last month in a bid to treat his alcoholism . The controversial mayor issued a statement saying that he had decided to 'seek immediate help' and was '100 per cent committed to getting myself right'. Later that week, Doug Ford, the brother and campaign manager of Ford, made an impassioned plea on his behalf. Choking back tears, Doug Ford said at a press conference: 'I’ll continue to stand by my brother and his family throughout this difficult journey.' The mayor first grabbed international attention last year when a group tried selling another video showing the mayor smoking crack. While that video was never released to the public, Toronto Police say they have a copy of it and Mayor Ford eventually copped to smoking the substance in a 'drunken stupor'.","Mayor's black Cadillac Escalada was impounded for seven days on Tuesday .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Northern Ireland police announced Thursday they will sue to obtain all of the audiotaped interviews of former militants who described their wartime careers to a Boston College oral history project, a move designed to reopen scores of ""cold case"" murder investigations in the British territory. Police last year successfully sued Boston College to obtain 11 interviews of Irish Republican Army veterans discussing the 1972 abduction, killing and secret burial of Jean McConville, a 38-year-old Belfast widowed mother of 10. Those tapes were used as a primary basis for arresting Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, who had been accused by some IRA interviewees of being the Belfast IRA commander at the time who ordered McConville's slaying. Adams denied the accusations and was released without charge May 4, although police did send an evidence file to British state prosecutors for potential charges later. Sinn Fein party leader Gerry Adams was released without charge Sunday . earlier this month following his suspected involvement in a . decades-old IRA killing of a Belfast mother of 10. The Police Service of Northern Island were granted access to confidential tapes recorded by Boston College - and now want the rest . The Boston College (pictured) archive contains 180 interviews with former paramilitaries, . six percent of which concern the murder of Irish mother Jean McConville. After gaining access to 11 of the tapes, the Police Service of Northern Ireland is now suing for access to the rest . Helen McKendry - daughter of Jean McConville, who was murdered by the IRA - said she wanted the people responsible for her mother's 'torture' to be brought before a court of law . Now, the Police Service of Northern Ireland says it wants the entire audio archive, including the accounts of former Ulster Volunteer Force members involved in the slayings of Catholic civilians. In a statement it said Serious Crime Branch detectives were doing this because of the police's 'statutory duty to investigate fully all matters of serious crime, including murder'. The move threatened to open up another legal can of worms for Boston College and the two officials who collected the oral history: journalist Ed Moloney and IRA veteran Anthony McIntyre. Dozens of IRA veterans and Protestant militants agreed to speak to McIntyre starting in 2001 on condition their interviews be kept secret until their deaths. Some of those interviewed have said they plan to sue Boston College to have the tapes and any other records of their interviews returned or destroyed. Jean McConville (left) was dragged from her home in West Belfast by the IRA in December 1972 and murdered . Boston College faced criticism over its decision to hand over the tapes concerning Mrs McConville's murder to the PSNI, because they were meant to remain sealed . Boston College itself said it was willing to return the interviews to their subjects. Thursday's police move appears designed to prevent that from happening. NBC News this month initiated its own legal processings seeking access to parts of the Northern Ireland audio archive at Boston College. In its May 6 letter to Judge William Young, the Boston judge who presided over most of the Northern Ireland police-Boston College legal tussle, NBC News said it wanted to see all transcripts, audio recordings and documents that had already been provided to the Northern Ireland police for the McConville investigation.","Boston College .

"By . Associated Press . and David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . U.S. Rep. John Conyers, the second most senior Democrat in the House of Representatives, lost his appeal Friday to get on the August primary ballot after Michigan election officials found problems with more than half of the Democrat's nominating petitions. The Secretary of State's office affirmed a decision by Detroit-area election officials to keep Conyers off the ballot since he only submitted 455 valid signatures from registered voters in his heavily Democratic district. At least 1,000 are needed to qualify for the primary ballot, and they must also be collected by registered voters. Most of Conyers' were not. The decision does not necessarily end Conyers' 50-year career in Congress as his campaign manager has said Conyers would mount a write-in effort if necessary. Why the long face? Rep. John Conyers will have to run for re-election as a wrote-in candidate after 50 years in Congress after signature gatherers screwed up . One foot out the door? Conyers (R), a 25-term congressman, may have to run as a write-in candidate if he wants to stay in the House of Representatives . Conyers is known for his unapologetic liberal stripes, but worked alongside some Republicans as well, including the late Rep. Henry Hyde (R) when they were their parties' top dogs on the House Judiciary Committee -- they're shown here sparring gently over the rules for President Bill Clinton's impeachment hearings . There is precedent in Michigan for such an effort. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan launched a successful write-in campaign in last year's primary after his name was kept off the ballot due to a residency issue. Conyers also has mounted a legal challenge to have the Michigan election law at the heart of the dispute declared unconstitutional, and a federal judge is expected to rule later Friday. 'The Secretary of State made her decision, and we'll live with it,' said Bert Johnson, Conyers' campaign chair and a Democratic state senator. 'Obviously, we disagree, and we'll wait for the federal court to rule.' Conyers, 85, had appealed to Secretary of State Ruth Johnson after Wayne County officials said there were problems with some people who collected signatures. The circulators weren't registered to vote or had listed a wrong registration address. That can spoil petitions, under Michigan law, and as a result Conyers lacked the 1,000 signatures necessary to get on the ballot. Johnson said Friday that she had no choice but to 'enforce the circulator registration requirement as written.' Big winner: Rev. Horace Sheffield (L) is running in the Democratic primary that will no longer see Conyers on the ballot . Conyers, now 85, has been in Congress for five decades and represents a staunchly Democratic district . 'A circulator's failure to register is a fatal defect that renders all signatures appearing on a petition he or she circulated invalid,' her review said Friday. Ending Conyers' career that way would be 'pretty outrageous,' his lawyer, John Pirich, said this week. Political opponents said Conyers should follow election procedures like other candidates. An attorney for a Democratic challenger, the Rev. Horace Sheffield III, said Conyers for decades had no problem following the law. 'In essence, they played the game, lost and then complained that the rules were unfair,' Eric Doster said, quoting a Virginia judge.","The No. 2 House Democrat is 85 years old and has served in Congress since 1964 .

"By . Sara Malm . A mother has been charged with child cruelty in connection with the death of her five-year-old daughter. Heaven Woods, five, was found unresponsive in the home of her mother’s boyfriend in Forsyth, Georgia, on Tuesday and later died in hospital as a result of blunt force trauma to her abdomen. The family of Amanda Hendrickson, 33, a mother of several children and pregnant with another, are now calling for the death penalty if she is involved in her daughter’s death. Charged: Amanda Hendrickson, 33, and her boyfriend Roderick Buckner, 34, faces felony first-degree child cruelty charges over the homicide of Hendrickson's daughter Heaven Woods, five . Heaven was found unresponsive in a home in Forsyth, belonging to Hendrickson’s boyfriend where the five-year-old and her mother had been living for the past month, and later died in hospital. An autopsy revealed she was killed by blunt force trauma to her abdomen and that she was suffering from both new and old injuries. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is now investigating the death as a homicide, and have also arrested Hendrickson’s boyfriend. The GBI said Hendrickson has a ‘history’ with the Georgia Department of Family and Children Services in their previous home town of Rome, and family members told a local news channel that she has several children and is pregnant with another child. Hendrickson’s Facebook page backs this statement, showing pictures of a recent ultrasound as well as images of Heaven as a baby. Devastated: Hendrickson¿s mother Lisa Coursey says her daughter, who is pregnant and has a history with local child services, should 'rot in hell' if she is involved in the death of five-year-old Heaven . According to family members, Heaven had previously been seen with visible evidence of physical abuse, but Ms Hendrickson had found explanations for them, such as falling over due to clumsiness. When Heaven's grandmother noticed a bruise in the shape of a hand on the girls' throat, Ms Hendrickson said the girl had tried to choke herself. Yesterday Hendrickson’s mother Lisa Coursey, and her half-sister Ashley Coursey, 21, called for the death penalty. “I want justice for my granddaughter,’ Ms Coursey told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ‘If she [her daughter] did this, she should rot in H-E-L-L.’ Hendrickson has been arrested on charges of felony child cruelty in the first degree and giving false statements. Her boyfriend Roderick Buckner, 34, also faces felony first-degree child cruelty charges. Authorities say additional charges are expected to be filed against both Hendrickson and Buckner, and the couple is being held without bond in the Monroe County Justice Center.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Snejana Farberov . and David Mccormack . In limbo: Scott Wilson, 23, was killed in a Florida car crash four years ago, but his ashes have yet to be put to rest because his divorced parents are at odds over what to do with them . The ashes of the young man killed four years ago in a fiery car wreck by a drunk-driving millionaire cannot be split among his divorced parents, a Florida judge has ruled. Scott Wilson, 23, died in 2010, but his ashes have yet to be put to rest because his divorced parents were butting heads in a bitter court battle over the remains. A judge for the 4th District Court of Appeals, in Palm Beach, reached all the way back to the 1700's to cite a case on human remains that ruled they are not 'property,' the Sun Sentinel reported. That judge then quoted the words of judge who in 2005 made a similar ruling in the state, . 'It is a sorrowful matter to have relatives disputing in court over the remains of the deceased,' Judge Martha Warner wrote, according to the paper. 'In this case in particular, there is no solution that will bring peace to all parties.' Wilson, an engineering graduate, was killed February 12, 2010, when John Goodman, the millionaire founder of The Palm Beach International Polo Club, rammed his Bentley into the victim's Hyundai and sent it flying into a canal. Wilson's parents were divorced at the time he died. A Catholic Mass was held one week later, after which Wilson's body was cremated. William Wilson's attorney argued last month that his son's ashes . should be treated as property owned by whoever has possession of them, . and can therefore be divided, according to Palm Beach Post. But . the lawyer representing Lili Wilson insisted that human remains cannot . be considered property. Therefore, the ashes cannot be split up between . the two feuding former spouses. William . Wilson wishes to lay his share of son's remains in a family cemetery . plot in Georgia. His devout mother, however, wants the ashes to remain . intact in Palm Beach County. Scroll down for video . Devout: Wilson's religious mother, Lili Wilson (left), wants the ashes to remain intact in Palm Beach County . At odds: Lili Wilson (right) and William Wilson (left) have been . fighting over their son's ashes since 2010, with the father wanting to . split the cremated remains and bury his share in a family plot in . Georgia . Judge Melanie May expressed concerns in court at the time that treating a person's cremated remains as property could be offensive to people's spiritual views. Not at peace: The final fate of Scott Wilson's ashes will soon be decided in a trial court . Attorney Kristina Pett, who represents Lili Wilson, agreed. ‘A person is not a thing. A person cannot be owned,’ she argued. ‘Just because the parents decided to cremate Scott does not make him property. Scott’s a person.’ William Wilson's counsel, Joy Bartmon, countered by saying that in this day and age, people dispose of loved ones’ ashes in various ways, from scattering them at sea to wearing them in lockets. ‘The law is clear: we can’t do anything we want with a body, but we can do anything we want with ashes,’ she stated. The dispute over Scott Wilson's ashes is only one issue in which his parents have been at odds. The Wilsons, who split in 2007, have fought bitterly over the husband's baseball card collection and ownership of their home videos. A final determination is yet to be made where Scott Wilson's ashes will finally end up. That will be determined in a trial court. 'This opinion does not guide the trial court in the determination to be made,' William Wilson's lawyer Joy Bartmon said in an email. 'Instead, what will occur when the decision as to the ashes goes back to the trial court, is what I wanted to avoid. 'The final resting place for this young man may be left to the discretion of an administrator who never knew him.' Florida tycoon John Goodman was convicted of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide in May 2012 and sentenced to 16 years in prison and a fine of $10,000, but he was granted a retrial last year after a juror at his first trial was adjudged to have lied to get on the panel. Polo tycoon: John Goodman now faces a retrial after his defense team successfully argued that a juror had lied during the selection process . Goodman, right, attempted to adopt his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins in a move designed to preserve part of his fortune for her while negotiating a civil suit settlement . Goodman, the multimillionaire . founder of one of world's largest polo clubs, claimed in court that . his $200,000 Bentley malfunctioned and lurched forward, slamming into . Wilson's vehicle. He has also denied being drunk at the . time of the crash, although other testimony has contradicted him and . his blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit three hours . after the crash, according to prosecutors. Goodman fled the scene of the accident, authorities said. During his first trial, Judge Jeffrey Colbath condemned Goodman's actions, saying: 'He left to try and save himself.' Goodman reached a settlement with the Wilson family and paid out $46million in compensation to them. It was split evenly between the divorced spouses prior to accounting for legal fees, court records showed. Goodman also made headlines when he . adopted his girlfriend, Heather Hutchins, 42, in an attempt to preserve . part of his fortune for her while negotiating a civil suit settlement. Last March, a Miami appeals court reversed the ruling that allowed the . adoption. During the original trial the . judge said: 'These are horrible, horrible cases from a criminal justice . standpoint. Scott Wilson's death was senseless. He was on the eve of . fullness of life.' Goodman’s second trial was originally scheduled to begin in March, but it has been delayed indefinitely. Horror crash: The crumpled car driven by Wilson, left, and the Bentley driven by Goodman, right. Goodman said he drank from a bottle of liquor he found after the crash - the reason he was over the limit . Deadly: Wilson family members look at the Bentley Goodman was driving when he ran a stop sign in 2010 . Prosecutors successfully claimed that . Goodman was drunk when he rammed his black Bentley convertible into . Mr Wilson's car four years ago, causing it to roll into a canal, where the 23-year-old man drowned after being unable to free himself from his seat belt. The millionaire disputed the claims and argued in court that the crash was the result of a malfunction with his brakes. Goodman left the scene and waited an . hour to call 911 while Scott drowned. He gave a dead cell phone battery . as the reason why he walked away from the crash scene. After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 per cent, more than twice the legal driving limit.

"By . Sarah Dean . The man who jumped on to a policeman's shoulder and launched himself on-stage with The Beatles in 1964 has revealed the moment he shook John Lennon's hand before Paul McCartney told police to 'let him go'. Brent McAuslan shot to fame when he escaped from the packed crowd at Melbourne's Festival Hall to shake hands with his idol John Lennon in front of thousands. The Beatles had just finished their final song of the night, Long Tall Sally, when the 19-year-old Australian broke through security to reach the Fab Four. Idol: Brent McAuslan shot to fame when he jumped from the packed crowd at Melbourne's Festival Hall to shake hands with John Lennon . Lennon held out his hand to the Mr McAuslan, and asked: 'How are you, cobber?' But seconds later police dashed on stage to grab him. The lifelong Beatles fan escaped without arrest thanks to one man - Sir Paul McCartney. Mr McAuslan, who is now 50 and living on the Gold Coast, told the Herald Sun he was trapped against a wall by police after the incident. The hand that touched Lennon: Mr McAuslan is now 50 but is still contacted about the day he stormed the stage . Super fan: He hugged John Lennon before police grabbed him from the stage . Famous: His brave efforts were captured on film and shown around the world . But as the band came off stage, Macca told them to let him go. 'I think the cops thought I made them look stupid,' Mr McAuslan said. 'Then when Paul told them to let me go, it was like Moses parting the waters. They just let me go back into the crowd.' In an interview posted on YouTube by Laura Scheirich, which includes footage of the incident, Mr McAuslan jokes: 'I wish I was as fit now as I was then.' He explains how he diverted the police's attention by asking a pretty girl to run up to the stage ahead of him and distract the cops. And when he surprisingly made it on to the stage, he claims he didn't feel like he was doing anything wrong. Fab Four: The Beatles sent Melbourne into a spin in the sixties . 'I felt connected with him, I didn't feel like I was invading,' he recounts. Beatlemania took over Australia for two delirious weeks when the band arrived Down Under in in June 1964. Five thousand screaming fans greeted the band at Essendon Airport, Melbourne. Another 200,000 people watched their motorcade into the city, with streets cordoned off and fans hanging from trees just to get a glimpse of the biggest band in the world. Forty thousand people paid up to 37 shillings (about $3.70) to see The Beatles' Melbourne shows. They played six concerts at Festival Hall (two a night, at 6pm and 8.45pm) and performed 10 songs in just 27 minutes.","Brent McAuslan jumped on to the stage at Melbourne's Festival Hall .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Delia Garcia-Bratcher, 30, appears during a hearing at the Sonoma County Superior Court in Santa Rosa, California, Thursday after allegedly grabbing a boy by the throat . A California mother accused of grabbing a 12-year-old boy by the throat for allegedly bullying her daughter did nothing wrong and may have been framed by the child, her attorney told reporters Thursday. Delia Garcia-Bratcher, 30, of Santa Rosa, briefly appeared in Sonoma County Superior Court Thursday, but was not formally charged with a crime. Deputy District Attorney Anne Masterson said the investigation is still ongoing and asked the judge to continue the case for the next two-three weeks, CBS San Francisco reported. Garcia-Bratcher was arrested last Saturday on suspicion of inflicting injury to a child after she allegedly confronted a 12-year-old boy at Olivet Elementary School Friday afternoon. Speaking to the press outside the courthouse Thursday, the mother's attorney, Ben Adams, called the 30-year-old woman a 'folk hero' for defending her daughter and suggested that her young accuser may have set her up, according to Santa Rosa Press Democrat. ‘She is the mother of the year,’ Adams declared. ‘She did nothing wrong. Her daughter was being bullied, and she confronted the bully. What is wrong with that?’ The lawyer insisted yo the station KTVU that he is in possession of exculpatory evidence proving that the 12-year-old boy lied about his client grabbing him by the throat. ‘She is adamant she never laid a hand on him,’ he said. Scroll down for video . Parenting icon: A lawyer for Garcia-Bratcher called her a 'folk hero' and 'mother of the year' for defending her 10-year-old daughter from a boy who allegedly called her a 'dirty Indian' Adams said that Garcia-Bratcher did go to her children’s school Friday and exchanged a few words with her 10-year-old daughter’s classmate, but she never laid a finger on him. ‘She said, “I don't want to have to tell on you. Stop being a brat,""’ Adams said, adding that the entire ordeal could have been prevented had school officials stepped up and done ‘their damn job.’ Asked about the red marks on the boy’s throat allegedly visible in photographs taken by a school official, Adams replied: ‘This boy is a bully, and I suspect he’s also a liar.’ Sonoma . County Sheriff's Lt. Steve Brown previously suggested that Garcia-Bratcher may have targeted the wrong child because investigators have . not found anything linking the 12-year-old boy to the bullying allegations. On Thursday, Ben Adams addressed these claims, telling the gathered reporters: 'She did not get the wrong boy. The boy is lying if he says otherwise.' Officials said at around 1.40pm on Friday, Garcia-Bratcher came to school to register one of her children when she ran into her son and asked him to point out the boy who has been calling her 10-year-old daughter a 'dirty Indian.' The 30-year-old is alleged to have assaulted the boy in front of a number of children, the Sonoma County Sheriff's office added in a statement. Remote: Delia Garcia-Bratcher, 30, came to Olivet Charter Elementary School (pictured), in Santa Rosa, California, to confront her daughter's alleged tormentor at lunchtime on Friday . No adult saw the confrontation, and Garcia-Bratcher apparently had not checked in with the school office before coming on campus, authorities said. The young witnesses later told a deputy the mother threatened the boy about bullying her daughter. The boy then ran to a classroom, told a teacher and the two went to the office where school officials took pictures of the injuries. The staff at the school took photos of red marks on the boy's neck as soon as they learned about the alleged assault, authorities said. Garcia-Bratcher was arrested on a charge of felony child abuse. She was released from jail after posting a $30,000 bail. The mother of six has since pulled her children from the elementary school, according to her attorney. She is due back in court June 19.","Delia Garcia-Bratcher, 30, allegedly came to Olivet Charter Elementary School in Northern California Friday and confronted the boy, 12 .

"By . Ryan Gorman . The plan: State officials released this report detailing how they wanted to limit STDs and teen pregnancies . New York state officials are considering sexual education classes for elementary school students and HIV tests for 13-year-olds, according to a new report. The New York State Youth Sexual Health Plan, released this week, found that one in four adolescents is likely to contract a sexually transmitted disease, and that about 60 per cent of all high school students in the state are sexually active before graduation. Authorities believe that taking a proactive approach to teaching children about sex is the only way to mitigate a future spike as children become sexually active at an increasingly younger age – but not all parents agreed. ‘I work around teenagers and the vast majority of them at 13, when I ask them if they’re sexually active, look at me like, ‘Are you crazy?’ Parent Joshua Stillman told WCBS. ‘And to put HIV testing on the plate in front of them, I think, would be not only weird for them, but probably make them think about something that’s not anywhere close to their consciousness.’ The state’s first-ever organized attempt to confront this growing challenge is bolstered by as many as 10 per cent of all students saying they did not use any birth control during sexual intercourse. Only 7.2 per cent said they used both a condom and another birth control method, according to the report. 'Reproductive and sexual health are key health issues for adolescents and young adults,' Acting State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zuckertold the New York Post. 'Providing accurate and comprehensive information to protect adolescents’ health and prepare them for responsible decision making is a public health priority.' Even more troubling, 63 per cent of all STDs are contracted by people aged 15 to 23-years-old, the state said. And one in five new cases of HIS is reported in an individual under the age of 25. ‘Thirteen might be, you know, a little young for that, but sadly not by much,’ Jeffrey Ernstoff told WCBS. Reading, writing and... sex ed: State officials want children as young as elementary school to begin learning about sex . The main objective of the comprehensive plan is to prevent the spread of STDs among schoolchildren, and also to prevent teen pregnancies. Almost 3,700 babies were reported born to mothers 17 or younger in 2012 in New York, the report said. One of the suggestion made to limit these births is to provide contraception to children as young as 15. Sex education is also suggested for students beginning as early as elementary school for those school districts that are interested. The plan has yet to be put into action and is merely just a series of suggestions. It is not clear how long it would take for it to be put into place.","Almost 3,700 babies were born to mothers 17 and under in 2012 in New York, state officials said .

"By . Associated Press . and Michael Zennie . Three more Mississippi Tea Party activists - including a party official - have been arrested over a photo taken of the ailing wife of longtime Republican Senator Thad Cochran. Authorities say the men were hoping to use the photo of Rose Cochran, taken in her nursing home without her permission, as part of a campaign to allege that Cochran had an affair with another woman. The picture of the senator's spouse, who has lived with dementia for 13 years, infuriated him and prompted a criminal investigation. It has also threatened to consume the Republican primary and undermine challenger Chris McDaniel - whom the suspects all support. The couple have been married 50 years and have two children together. On Thursday, police arrested attorney Mark Mayfield, a Central Mississippi Tea Party board member who has helped raise campaign cash for McDaniel; elementary school teacher Richard Sager and John Mary. Scroll down for video . Conservative blogger Clayton Thomas Kelly, 28,  is accused of taking a picture of Rose Cochran in her nursing home . Write caption here . Richard Sager . Last week, officers arrested vonservative blogger Clayton Thomas Kelly, 28 - the man who allegedly took the picture. McDaniel, who is backed by the tea party, has said he wasn't involved in any attempt to take pictures of Ms Cochran. 'As we have said since day one, the violation of the privacy of Mrs. Cochran is out of bounds for politics and is reprehensible,' McDaniel said in a statement Thursday. 'Any individuals who were involved in this crime should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.' Cochran campaign spokesman Jordan Russell said any suggestion that the 76-year-old six-term senator is having an inappropriate relationship with another woman is 'outrageous and offensive and the dirtiest form of politics. As we see from the arrests today, these people will stop at nothing to smear Thad Cochran, including a despicable act like the one committed against Rose Cochran.' The Cochran family says Mrs Cochran has lost the ability to speak and is receiving hospice care. During questioning in court, Madison police investigator Vickie Currie said investigators believe the conspiracy was intended to use images of Mrs Cochran to advance allegations Cochran was having an inappropriate relationship. Currie said it was Kelly's third attempt to photograph the 72-year-old woman. The mushrooming legal action threatened to subsume the primary challenge by McDaniel, a state senator from Ellisville. Cochran was elected to the Senate in 1978 after six years in the House. The primary is June 3. Kelly earlier was charged with exploitation of a vulnerable adult and filming without permission. A conspiracy charge was added Thursday in Madison City Court. Senator Thad Cochran has lashed out at the allegations and the use of his wife's picture. He and Rose Cochran have been married 50 years . His lawyer, Kevin Camp, could not persuade Judge Dale Danks to dismiss or downgrade the exploitation charge to a misdemeanor. Camp argued that the state needed to prove the value of the crime was more than $250 to hold Kelly on a felony charge. Currie, however, argued that Rose Cochran's image was 'priceless' and the state had probable cause to show a felony had been committed. Camp said in an interview Wednesday that Kelly obtained a visitor's pass to the nursing home and photographed Rose Cochran through a door that was opened to a hallway. Danks chose to send the case to a grand jury and Kelly was being held on $200,000 bond. Mayfield, arrested by police at his law office, was charged with conspiracy and the judge gave him a bond of $250,000. Though his lawyers objected that the bond was too high, they said Mayfield would post it. Sager was charged with evidence tampering and conspiracy and held on $500,000 bond. Mary was charged with two counts of conspiracy involving the exploitation of a vulnerable person and the photographing or filming of a person without permission where there is an expectation of privacy. Investigators said Mary was released on his own recognizance because of health issues. The roles of Mayfield, Sager and Mary in the conspiracy were not immediately clear. Federal Election Commission records show Mayfield contributed $500 to McDaniel's campaign in March. Madison police refused to comment and court employees would not release documents on the charges. The investigation into the pictures has added another set of personal attacks to a bitter race. Outside groups are running ads that say Cochran is out of touch with Mississippi and not conservative enough. Cochran supporters are criticizing McDaniel over remarks he made while hosting a talk radio show, cases he brought as a lawyer, and whether his philosophy would benefit the nation's poorest state, which is highly dependent on federal spending. Mayfield has been involved in local tea party politics for years. Since 2011, he has sent out tea party news releases in support of charter schools, a voter identification law, U.S. border security and gun rights. The 'Chris McDaniel for United States Senate; Facebook page includes a photo showing Mayfield was among the sponsors of an April 21 McDaniel fundraising reception at the Capital Club in downtown Jackson. Ticket prices ranged from $100 a person to $2,500 a person. The reception took place the day after the photo was taken of Rose Cochran in the nursing home.

"By . Associated Press . An unopposed candidate in a city council election in West Virginia has pushed for the vote to be re-done because rather than winning outright he was left off the ballot entirely. Curtis Mele believed his ticket to a third consecutive term was secure but a clerical error kept him from being selected. Instead, another councilman was listed as the candidate in his district in Benwood. Not returning: As it stands, Curtis Mele (seen right at a 2012 city council meeting) will not be representing his district for a third term because he was left off the ballot even though he was running unopposed . Now, officials in the town of 1,600 are scrambling for a solution, and Mele has hired an attorney to contest the election. 'It might be an honest mistake... but that's a mistake that should never happen,' Mele said Thursday. Third time unlucky: Mele said he only learned of the mix up four hours after the polls opened . Mele, whose name didn't appear anywhere on the May 13 ballot, was one of four unopposed council members. The responsibility for Benwood's ballot information falls on the office of City Clerk Judy Hunt. 'She dropped the ball, which is now costing me,' Mele said. Hunt referred questions Thursday to city attorney Eric Gordon, who didn't immediately return a telephone message. Marshall County Clerk Jan Pest said it's up to the cities to get their information right, including how names appear on the ballot. Pest said cities send their ballot information to her office after the candidate filing period. The county clerk's office then has the information prepared for processing and sends a version back to the cities to be proofread before printing. Mele said he found out about the ballot mix-up through a phone call more than four hours after the polls opened. He contacted Gordon, and the Secretary of State's office was consulted. According to Mele, the city could consider a special election or appoint him to serve until the next municipal election in 2016 - two options he finds unacceptable. Small town: Officials in Benwood- a town of 1,600- are scrambling for a solution, and Mele has hired an attorney to contest the election . Mele said a special election brings up the possibility that he would face opposition. The City Council plans to meet next Tuesday to address the issue. Pest said her office certified the election Thursday morning which clears the way for Mele to contest the results. Secretary of State spokesman Jake Glance said his office's role is simply to record election results that are certified and passed on by county clerks.","Curtis Mele was running for his third term as a city councilman in the town of Benwood, West Virginia .

Scientists admitted to being surprised by the discovery, which indicates that even insects show signs of intelligence. Gathering information before deciding on a course of action was previously thought to be the preserve of only highly evolved species, such as monkeys and humans. Scientists have shown that flies 'think before they act'. The research was carried out by tasking flies with picking between two similar odours, and it was found they thought longer when the decision was harder. Here is shown one of the fruit flies in one of the chambers . In a series of tests, the researchers asked fruit flies to distinguish between ever closer concentrations of an odour they were trained to avoid. When the concentrations were very different and easy to tell apart, the flies acted quickly to move to the end of a chamber furthest away from the strongest smell. But when they were very close and difficult to distinguish, the flies took much longer to make a decision, and made more mistakes. Instead of responding impulsively, they seemed to accumulate information, weighing up what their smell sense was telling them before committing to a choice. Professor Gero Miessenbock, from Oxford University’s Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, said: 'Freedom of action from automatic impulses is considered a hallmark of cognition or intelligence. 'What our findings show is that fruit flies have a surprising mental capacity that has previously been unrecognised.' The researchers, whose findings appear in the journal Science, showed that a gene called FoxP was involved in the decision-making process in the fly’s brain. The gene was active in a small set of around 200 nerve cells. Lead author Dr Shamik DasGupta, also from Oxford University, said: 'Before a decision is made, brain circuits collect information like a bucket collects water. 'Once the accumulated information has risen to a certain level, the decision is triggered. 'When FoxP is defective, either the flow of information into the bucket is reduced to a trickle, or the bucket has sprung a leak.' Flies with a mutation in FoxP took longer than normal flies to make decisions when odours were difficult to distinguish. Like a human paralysed by a difficult choice, they became indecisive. Mathematical . models developed to describe the mechanisms of decision-making in . humans and other primates matched the behaviour seen in the fruit flies, . the scientists found. Fruit flies have one FoxP gene, while humans have four related FoxP genes. Human FoxP1 and FoxP2 have previously been associated with language and mental development. The genes are also linked to the ability to learn fine sequential movements, such as playing the piano. Flies with a mutation in their one FoxP gene, which is linked with the ability to learn fine sequential movements such as playing the piano (stock image pictured), took longer than normal to make decisions when they were presented with odours that were difficult to distinguish . 'We don’t know why this gene pops up in such diverse mental processes as language, decision-making and motor learning,' Professor Miesenbock said. 'One feature common to all of these processes is that they unfold over time. 'FoxP may be important for wiring the capacity to produce and process temporal sequences in the brain.' He added: 'FoxP is not a ""language gene"", a ""decision-making gene"", even a ""temporal-processing"" or ""intelligence gene"". 'Any such description would in all likelihood be wrong. 'What FoxP does give us is a tool to understand the brain circuits involved in these processes. 'It has already led us to a site in the brain that is important in decision-making.'","Researchers tasked fruit flies with discerning between similar odours .
And the study at Oxford University found them to be indecisive .
When faced with a tough decision they took longer to deliberate, like us .
The research shows a gene called FoxP is responsible for decision making .

"By . Chris Pleasance . From a distance this globe may look like any other but it is in fact made from thousands of matchsticks. Created by artist Andy Yoder, 56, from Cleveland, Ohio, the incredible creation is built from 300,000 individual matchsticks glued together facing outwards. Each of the matches was hand painted and took two years to build. The matches were also coated in flame retardant to make sure the artwork didn't burst into flames. This sculpture, which measures 43 inches around, was made by  artist Andy Yoder from 300,000 matchsticks . The New York artist took two years to paint the tip of each matchstick before gluing them together . New York-based artist Yoder used satellite images of the Earth during Hurricane Sandy as a basis for the sculpture as well as a second-hand desktop globe to help map the contours of each country. Built in his backyard studio, the striking piece of art weighs more than 90kg and measures 43 inches in diameter. Andy said 'I didn't have an ""aha"" moment, but instead the idea to build a globe made from matchsticks came to me as an subconscious idea, probably when I was half asleep or in a dream like state. Hanging from the ceiling in Mr Yoder's backyard studio, the artwork weighs nearly 200lb (90kg, left). Viewed from a distance the highly detailed work appears just like genuine pictures of the Earth (right) Not wanting his prized creation to burst into flames, Mr Yoder dipped each match in flame retardant . 'I bought a desktop globe at a second hand store to help map the globe and used the latitude and longitude lines as a grid that I could transfer to my larger model. 'Each square of the grid was numbered, so I could copy the contours of the continents square by square. 'When people see my work, they become wide eyed with gaping mouths and instantly they want to touch it. The sculpture also features the infamous Hurricane Sandy (left) which brought New York to a standstill, as Mr Yoder worked from satellite images (right) of the storm as it hit the West Coast . While the West Coast is modelled on satellite images, the rest of the work was created from a desktop globe . Mr Yoder says the work, which consumed him for four days a week for two years, is the most labour-intensive he has ever done . 'Luckily, my globe isn't flammable, I painted the tips by dipping 5 matchsticks at a time in a mixture of paint, water and flame retardant. 'Although I have tried many large scale art installations in the past, this is by far the most work intensive and time consuming project I have ever done.'","Artist Andy Yoder, 56, took two years to create the giant sculpture .

"By . Sally Lee . It's the awkward situation that no convicted fraudster wants to be in. But the infamous Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort is no stranger to confrontation, especially when it comes to the Australian media. This time, thanks to Triple M's Grill Team, the former stockbroker went head to head with a disgruntled Californian investor on Friday morning. Jordan Belfort was attacked during another Australian interview, this time on Triple M's Grill Team based in Sydney on Friday morning . This followed the accusations Minor made during a previous interview which was put straight to Belfort. 'He's a liar and a cheat and he's preyed on not just the rich, he's also preyed on the poor people and the middle class,' the investor said yesterday. Minor went on to say that he invested $80,000 but is still owed about $50,000. 'If you are here to do a hatchet job on me I have a lot of interviews to do,' Belfort responded as he tried to move on from the accusations. But much to his surprise, real estate appraiser Ken Minor was waiting on the other line during the interview with Sydney-based radio show. The former stockbroker was recently brought to life on the big screen as Leonardo DiCaprio portrayed him in The Wolf Of Wall Street . 'Where is my money?' Minor demanded - a question he's been waiting to ask Belfort for years. 'I'm not here to engage in sensationalism, Ken,' he said. 'Call my office, we'll have a private conversation any time you'd like.' But the interview conveniently wrapped up when Ken said: 'I can't get anybody to call me back with anybody that knows anything about sending me any money'. In an interview to be aired on 2Day FM on Monday morning, Belfort claims he is paying back his victims and aims to pay back everyone this year using 100 per cent of his US profits. 'I'll set the record straight here, this is a big question, and I'll give you the most succinct answer I possibly can,' he told the station's hosts. 'I paid back a lot of money, I always have. Even when I first got out of jail I was paying back 50 per cent of my income for the first few years that I was on probation – that was my deal with the government. 'Once that deal was over, they had a judgement against me and I tried, I tried actively tried to turn over 100 per cent of the books... and the movie, and the government literally fought me tooth and nail every step of the way, it did not want to hear from me. Belfort said with a US tour announced this year, he is paying back 100 per cent of the profits. 'Everything I make in the US this year, it should be around 50 million bucks, and I'm paying off everybody in one shot, that’s my goal for this year,' he said. He added he was sorry about what he did but was focused on rectifying the situation. 'It's more about what you do about it - talk is cheap, bottom line,' he said. Last week MailOnline reported that the former stockbroker said he was attacked in a 60 Minutes interview and described journalist Liz Hayes as a 'f-wit' Belfort raked in a known $200million from his Long Island-based brokerage, Stratton Oakmont, during the late 1980s and 90s. The US Securities and Exchange Commission shut down Belfort's firm in 1998 and he was then convicted and sentenced to four years in jail in 2003 for defrauding investors. As part of his sentence, 'the Wolf' was ordered to pay $110.4 million in restitution to his 1513 ­victims. He spent 22 months in prison and has paid back $11.6 million to date.","Californian investor Ken Minor confronts Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort during a phone interview with Triple M's Grill Team on Friday morning .

"By . James  Nye . Result: Jason Omar Griffith, looks on after a guilty verdict was read during his murder trial at the Regional Justice Center on Thursday, May 22, 2014, in Las Vegas . A former Las Vegas Strip performer was found guilty Thursday of second-degree murder for killing and dismembering his dancer ex-girlfriend in a closely watched case that offered a lurid glimpse behind the scenes of the Sin City stage community. Jason Omar Griffith sat motionless as the verdict was read in Clark County District Court, but blew a kiss to his mother, Charlene Davis, as he was handcuffed to be taken to jail. Defense attorney Abel Yanez characterized Griffith's reaction as 'numb. Not upset, not happy.' The jury deliberated for about 14 hours over two days after hearing nine days of testimony about the strangulation death of Deborah Flores Narvaez during a December 12, 2010, argument at Griffith's home. Flores' sister Celeste Flores Narvaez sobbed into her mother's shoulder as the verdict was read. She had said she wanted Griffith to be convicted of first-degree murder. The family left the courthouse without speaking with reporters. Griffith's defense attorneys said they will appeal, and Yanez added that his client was not the person the killing suggested he was. Goodbye mom: Jason Omar Griffith, (center), blows a kiss to his mother before being lead away and after a guilty verdict was read during his murder trial at the Regional Justice Center on Thursday, May 22, 2014, in Las Vegas . Prosecutor Marc DiGiacomo said he respected the verdict and understood it was difficult for jurors to decide guilt in domestic violence cases. He also said he expected Griffith to receive the maximum 10 years to life in prison at sentencing July 23. 'You don't get to dismember a body and not serve life in prison,' DiGiacomo said. Griffith could also get a definite 10- to 25-year sentence. He could have faced up to life in prison without parole for first-degree murder. Deborah Flores' disappearance in mid-December 2010 drew intense attention for almost a month before Griffith's housemate, Louis Colombo, led police to her dismembered remains in tubs of concrete in a vacant house. Prison: Jason Omar Griffith, (right), is comforted by his attorney Jeff Banks after a guilty verdict was read during his murder trial at the Regional Justice Center on Thursday, May 22, 2014, in Las Vegas . The trial was a tale of sex, lies, betrayal and violence between two passionate and ambitious Las Vegas Strip dancers. Griffith spent four days testifying that Flores' death was self-defense. He said he grabbed her from behind with his arms around her neck when he thought she was reaching for a purse that may have contained a gun. No weapon was found. He said he panicked afterward and asked Colombo to help dispose of the body. DiGiacomo derided Griffith's self-defense claim as a fabrication and said he did nothing to resuscitate Flores. Griffith, 35, is originally from Brooklyn, New York. He went by the name 'Blu' as a performer in the Cirque du Soleil show 'Love,' based on Beatles music at The Mirage resort. Accused: Griffith, pictured in court last week, has been found guilty of the murder of Deborah Flores Narvaez . Horrific: The dismembered body of dancer Deborah Flores Narvaez was found encased in concrete in 2011 . He testified that he juggled girlfriends and sexual acquaintances before and after he met Flores at a football halftime show in November 2009. Flores, who went by Debbie, moved to Las Vegas from Maryland. She worked her way from go-go club work to a stage role in the racy 'Fantasy' revue at the Luxor. Evidence showed that by the time they became intimate in early 2010, Flores thought their relationship was monogamous. But Griffith was meeting several women for casual sex and pursuing Agnes Roux, a performer in the Cirque show 'Zumanity' at the New York-New York hotel. Griffith testified that his relationship with Flores had movie-style 'Fatal Attraction' characteristics. He said she stalked, threatened, harassed and assaulted him when he tried to limit their time together, and that no one took him seriously despite more than a dozen calls to police for help. Relief: Celeste Flores Narvaez, (second right), sister of Deborah Flores Narvaez, is comforted after a guilty verdict was read during the  murder trial at the Regional Justice Center on Thursday . Prosecutor Michelle Fleck said Griffith fanned Flores' anger by deceiving her about his sexual relationships, pulling away after accompanying her to an abortion clinic in May, then resuming their intimacy about the time of her 31st birthday in early July. The two continued an off-and-on relationship until her death. Flores had a temper, and several of Griffith's friends and co-workers testified that she became violent when she was angry - drawing stares and sometimes security officers during outbursts in public places. Roux testified that she broke up with Griffith after learning that he was sleeping with other Cirque dancers. End of the ordeal: Celeste Flores Narvaez, sister of Deborah Flores Narvaez, reacts after a guilty verdict was read during the trial of Jason Omar Griffith . She said she told Griffith in early December 2010 they couldn't be together if he was still seeing Flores. On the witness stand, Griffith testified the fatal argument developed after Flores told him she was pregnant for the second time in about six months and wanted another abortion. He said it escalated after Flores demanded he quit seeing Roux and devote his full attention to her. Flores' arm hit his face, Griffith said, as she reached past him toward her purse. Griffith said he grabbed her from behind, fell backward to the floor and held tightly until she stopped struggling. Colombo testified he helped entomb and move the remains. He received immunity from prosecution before leading police to the tubs of concrete on Jan. 8, 2011. Griffith was the one who sawed Flores' legs from her torso, Colombo said. Griffith said it was Colombo.","Jason Omar Griffith found guilty of second-degree murder of his girlfriend, Deborah Flores Narvaez in December, 2010 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A paranoid schizophrenic who axed his housemate to death after walking out of hospital left a note on the body saying: ‘I told doctors I am not safe’. Ahmed Ali, 39, told medics at the scandal-hit Oxleas Hospital Trust he had stopped taking his medication just days before killing Abdullah Barre Jama, 45, in a frenzied axe attack. He confessed to feeling tired and ‘persecuted’ and was due to be transferred to a psychiatric unit for further treatment. Discharged: Ali was allowed to walk out of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in South East London - and killed just three days later . Ali had a 15-year history of mental health problems, including violent urges towards himself and others, and Mr Jama himself told doctors his flatmate was ‘crazy’. But Ali walked out of hospital on April 30, 2009, and repeatedly stabbed Mr Jama in the head, neck and arms at their flat in Blackheath, South East London, on May 3, 2009. Concerned friends discovered the bloodied body on a mattress in the living room the next day, with Ali’s handwritten note on the back of a film poster on top of his chest. Prosecutor Simon Denison said the note was unreadable in parts, but included the phrase: ‘I’m innocent, I do nothing wrong'. (sic) It also said: ‘Somalia illegal assassination is everywhere... I toll doctors and Nurstes I am not safe’. (sic) The Oxleas Hospital Trust was slammed in 2011 after schizophrenia sufferer Nicola Edgington killed Sally Hodkin with a meat cleaver in Bexleyheath after walking out of hospital. Mr Denison said Ali had repeatedly told doctors he believed he was the victim of a conspiracy within the Somali community. ‘He subjected Mr Jama to a frenzied attack with a hand axe, which he used to inflict severe injuries to his head, neck and arms’, he said. ‘There’s consistent evidence he has suffered from chronic paranoid psychosis, a condition which has progressively worsened from the start of his treatment until the time of the killing in May 2009.’ Previously: The hospital which let Ali walk free . was previously attacked for discharging Nicola Edgington, left, who . murdered Sally Hodkin, right, in 2011 . He said Ali had been in mental health treatment since December 1995, shortly after arriving in the UK as a refugee from war-torn Somalia. He had previously stabbed his own brother, and became estranged from his wife and two children believing they were also involved in a conspiracy against him. ‘He believed his wife was using witchcraft against him, part of a wider conspiracy against him including his wife and the Somali community’, said Mr Denison. His brother admitted him to hospital in May 2008 under the Mental Health Act, after Ali suffered paranoid beliefs that people were trying to kill him. After finishing treatment at Michael Castle Centre, in Sheffield, he was released on March 31, 2009, and went back to live with Mr Jama in a flat in Blackheath. Mr Denison said: ‘It was clear he was still unwell. Even Mr Jama said the defendant was upset with him for keeping him in hospital. ‘In April 2009, Mr Jama said the defendant was crazy and that all he talked about is killing someone or killing himself. ‘However, Mr Jama said he did not feel unsafe with the defendant.’ On April 29, 2009, Ali was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, after complaining of feeling persecuted and tired. ‘He said he was not taking his medication’, said Mr Denison. ‘He was kept in overnight and intended for transfer back to Sheffield, but left of his own accord the following day.’ He said Mr Jama was last seen alive at a Somalia social club on May 2, and friends became concerned when he failed to return the following day. They found his bloodied body on a mattress in the flat on May 4, along with the blood stained axe lying on the floor nearby. Ali was soon arrested, but when his case came to court, in September 2010, he was unfit to enter a plea and a murder trial went ahead without him. After his conviction for murder, he was detained at Wathwood Hospital in Rotherham for treatment and has now been deemed fit enough to enter a plea. Ali denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Dr Darren Bloye, his psychiatrist, said Ali was suffering ‘florid paranoid delusions’ at the time of the killing, and still believes the Somali community are against him. Judge Richard Hone QC ordered Ali’s continued detention at the hospital under section 37 of the Mental Health Act. He told him: ‘Because of the possibility of relapse being observed from time to time and your history, it is essential not only to make a hospital order but also a restriction order without limit of time because of the obvious and perceived risks not only to your own health and safety but to others, especially the Somali community. ‘Delusional beliefs sometimes take over and you become a serious and lethal danger to their community.’ Ali, of Blackheath, South East London denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.","Ahmed Ali, 39, was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in South East London in 2009 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured leaving his house this morning, is assessing the damage to the Lib Dems' local government base . Nick . Clegg today refused to resign as Lib Dem leader after losing control of some of his party's flagship councils. The Lib Dems were ousted from Portsmouth after a surge of support for Ukip while the Tories took control of Kingston-upon-Thames - the local authority of Energy Secretary Ed Davey. A rare glimmer of good news came in Eastleigh, where the Lib Dems have tightened their grip on the local authority after successfully defending the parliamentary seat in a by-election last year. Mr Clegg conceded that his party had suffered at the hands of a Ukip surge, blaming a 'very strong anti-politics feeling among the public. But he added: 'Actually I think in the areas where we have MPs where we have good organisation on the ground... we are actually doing well.' The Lib Dems are are on course to lose around 300 seats. Earlier Lib Dem minister Lynne Featherstone said her party had lost its ‘humanity’ in office. ‘Ukip . have managed to sound like human beings – that’s Nigel Farage’s big . win,’ she told the BBC. ‘All of us have become so guarded, we are so . on-message that we seem to have lost some of our humanity. ‘The . Lib Dems are the whipping boys in the coalition. In the last general . election debates Nick came across as the human being… Partly being in . government, we have become more ministerial, we have become more . political. We have lost some of the humanity Nick had four years ago.’ With . rumours swirling of a leadership plot, Mr Clegg has urged his party not . to ‘lose its nerve’ just as the Government’s key decisions are being . ‘vindicated’. Mr Clegg told reporters it was 'never easy' seeing 'dedicated, hard-working' councillors kicked out. But he said he would 'absolutely not' resign, and insisted the Lib Dems were still succeeding where they focused on their achievements in coalition. 'Based on the results which have come in so far, it has obviously been a mixed result, a mixed night for my party, for the Liberal Democrats and the other mainstream parties,' Mr Clegg said. 'We will see what the further results today, what story they tell. But so far what I have seen is that where we can work really hard to tell our side of the story, we can win.' He added: 'I certainly accept that there is a very strong anti-politics mood around, not only in our country but in many other parts of Europe as well. I think you will see that in European elections in the days to come... 'There is a very strong mood of restlessness and dissatisfaction with mainstream politics and that is reflected in the results for all mainstream parties, including the Lib Dems.' Mr Clegg is under fresh pressure, with the Lib Dems braced to lose many of their MEPs when the European election results emerge on Sunday night . WINS: Did well in Eastleigh - stopping Ukip from taking any seats on council. LOSSES: Portsmouth slipped into no overall control, as Ukip took four seats. Tories took overall control of Kingston-upon-Thames. Labour took Cambridge. Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Malcolm Bruce played down his party's losses and stressed it intended to be a 'major force' in British politics for the foreseeable future. He told BBC Breakfast: 'It is obviously disappointing to lose councillors, particularly those who have worked hard in their community and may have been replaced by those who haven't got a track record. 'But actually we are pleased that where we have targeted our resources, particularly in held seats or key seats, we have actually had very good results. 'That's really very important for us. Getting an even share across the country doesn't deliver seats, getting them in the seats that matter is what matters to us.' Senior party . figures dismiss ideas that Mr Clegg could be replaced by Danny Alexander or . Vince Cable, but are preparing for a bumpy few weeks if the results are . bad. In several European election polls, the party has been languishing . in fifth place behind the Greens. A . poll suggests that only 46 per cent of Lib Dem voters would want Mr . Clegg to stay in his job if the party ends up in that position. David . Cameron and senior Tories, however, are said to be planning a ‘Save . Clegg’ operation that will see the Lib Dems given ‘wins’ in the . forthcoming Queen’s Speech. Lib . Dem sources insisted their vote was holding up well in their . Parliamentary seats, and that both the Tories and Labour were falling . short of the sort of results they need to demonstrate if they want to . win a majority next year.","LATEST: Lib Dems have 404 seats, down 284.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Sixteen people in LA County are being monitored by doctors after fears they may have been exposed to the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS. They all shared a flight with a man being treated for the disease in Florida, said CBS Los Angeles quoting the California Department of Public Health. The disease emerged two years ago in Saudi Arabia and like its cousin, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), causes coughing, fever and sometimes fatal pneumonia. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Scientists still have no idea how people are getting infected with MERS . More than 650 people worldwide have been infected with it, and MERS is reaching new victims every day in the Saudi kingdom, killing around 30 per cent of them. Scientists say what stands out about the MERS virus is just how little the world knows about it, even though for almost two years it has been viewed as one of the top potential pandemic threats by a global network of specialists who keep tabs on all emerging viruses. So far, much evidence points to camels as a possible infection source - with the virus staging a so-called zoonotic event by jumping from animals to people. Animal origin: Evidence points to camels as a possible infection source . But scientists still have no idea how people are getting infected, whether by eating camel meat, or drinking the milk, touching blood or other body fluids, or simply being nearby when they cough or sneeze. There is also no good data on how many people may be catching the virus but showing no or few symptoms, or how to successfully treat patients who get sick with MERS.

"By . Richard Spillett . Stuart Hall, pictured when he was first charged in late 2012, has been sentenced to another two years and six months in prison for two counts of indecently assaulting a young girl . Disgraced broadcaster Stuart Hall has been sentenced to another two years and six months in prison for indecently assaulting an under-age girl. But a judge has told him he would have received a 'considerably greater' sentence if he had been prosecuted under current laws. The former It's A Knockout presenter was cleared last week of 15 counts of rape in relation to two women who claimed they were sexually assaulted by him between 1976 and 1981. The 84-year-old was convicted by the jury at Preston Crown Court of indecently assaulting one of the complainants when she was under the age of 16, and had earlier pleaded guilty to another indecent assault on the same girl when she was 13. The charge Hall admitted involved an incident at a dinner party where he crept into his victim’s bedroom and assaulted her. The married father-of-two is currently serving a 30-month jail term after he pleaded guilty last year to indecently assaulting 13 other young girls, aged between nine and 17, over a 20-year period. The ex-BBC Radio 5 Live football match commentator had not been due for release from that custodial sentence until September. Hall will not now be eligible for release until December 2015 as today’s sentence will only begin after the end of his current jail term. Passing sentence, Lord Justice Turner said of his offences: 'It was an act of vile bravado and horrible betrayal.' Hall, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and striped tie, was excused from standing as sentence was passed. He . sat impassively in the dock, with his head bowed, his legs crossed and . his hands resting on his lap as he listened to the proceedings through a . large pair of headphones. Stuart Hall (centre) became famous in the 1970s when he presented hit TV show It's A Knockout . The victim of his latest offences sat yards away and began wiping away tears with a handkerchief passed to her, as details of the offences were again mentioned in court. The judge said one of the aggravating factors of the offences against the victim was Hall’s initial public denials of guilt. He added: 'Your lack of remorse evinced in your prepared statement to the police in which you expressed surprise against all the allegations against you when you knew you had molested her.' Hall was . sentenced to 12 months for the offence he admitted and was given an . additional 18 months for the indecent assault of which he was convicted . by the jury. He will serve half of the new sentence in custody before he is released on licence. The . judge said that, had Hall committed the dinner party offence in more . recent years, his conduct would have been classed as assault by . penetration. It is understood that in Hall's circumstances that would have led to a minimum eight-year jail term. The . second assault, where he had oral sex with the victim before she was 16, would have been categorised today as sexual activity with a . child. That too 'would have comfortably exceeded' the maximum the judge could impose. Mr . Justice Turner said the 'court's hands were tied' by the European Convention on Human Rights, adding: 'The sentence for each offence has to be limited . to the maximum sentence at the date when the offence was committed.' Hall committed the first indecent assault on the same occasion he abused another girl - which he also admitted in the first court case. He took advantage of the victims when they were sick after drinking from a bottle of spirits. Hall, pictured outside court for a previous hearing, will now not be eligible for release until December 2015 . Addressing Hall, Mr Justice Turner said: 'You volunteered to help clean them up. Your real intentions, however, were far darker. 'You saw their condition not as a cause for concern but as an ideal opportunity to carry out acts of gross sexual molestation on the two girls while they were at least partly incapacitated by drink.' He went into the girl's bedroom and sexually assaulted her, the court heard. 'She woke up during this ordeal and you continued until at one point you tried to get on top of her,' he said. 'Eventually you desisted and left the room. As if this behaviour were not grotesque enough, on the same evening you molested your victim's friend in the very same way while purporting to give her a bath. 'The vileness of your conduct on that evening would be difficult to exaggerate. The element of breach of trust was of the utmost gravity. 'Your victim was well below the age of consent. You carried out your depredations under the roof of her parents and under the camouflage of synthetic concern for the welfare of children. 'You repaid your friends' hospitality by cynically defiling their daughter.' The judge told Preston Crown Court (pictured) that his hands were tied by the sentencing rules at the time the offences were committed . The judge said Hall could have 'wiped the slate clean' last summer by admitting this offence earlier. He told him: 'You therefore denied yourself the freedom from subsequent prosecution and punishment which a full confession would have given you. To this extent, you are therefore the author of your present situation.' He went on: 'I take the view that the fact that you molested two girls in such quick succession sheds an even more sinister light on your offending than was evidenced by the one related offence to which you pleaded guilty last year. 'It is difficult to resist the conclusion that it must have been with a sense of arrogant and contemptible immunity that you defiled each of these young girls, one in the immediate wake of another.' The offence of oral sex occurred within the context of the pair having 'frequent' sexual intercourse at the BBC studios at Piccadilly and Oxford Road in Manchester, the court heard. Mr Justice Turner said the jury was sure that oral sex had taken place on one occasion at least. Hall, from . Wilmslow, Cheshire, did not give evidence at his trial but his defence . team did not dispute that he had sexual intercourse with both . complainants. Apart . from one occasion when Hall said an alleged rape of one of the girls . when she was aged 12 did not take place, his counsel argued the . intercourse - when they were were in their mid-teens and he was in his . mid-40s - was consensual and that he was not a rapist. Earlier, Crispin Aylett QC, mitigating, said Hall was a man in his 80s who had been brought to account for offences committed more than 30 years ago and had now faced three separate sets of proceedings. Mr Aylett continued: 'That would have been intolerable for anyone but for a man of 84, facing the prospect of dying in prison, the burden can scarcely be imagined.' 'He's been punished, he's been disgraced and for what it's worth, he's been financially ruined and I say on his behalf, enough is enough.'","Commentator jailed for 30 months last year for indecently assaulting 13 girls .

"By . Richard Spillett . Fraudster: Colin Jarvie conned his wife, his employers, customers and insurance companies out of £92,000 . An unsuspecting bride was scammed out of more than £50,000 by her conman husband - who even pawned her diamond wedding ring. Mechanical engineer Colin Jarvie, 38, spent four years stealing from new wife Letizia Salaris to fund his taste in expensive cars. He was jailed for 27 months yesterday after admitting seven charges of fraud and one of theft in what a judge branded 'a catalogue of dishonesty'. Gloucester Crown court heard Letizia became a victim of Jarvie from the moment they were married, after meeting him on an online dating site. He ducked out of their Far East honeymoon by saying he was ill and had to go to hospital. In fact he had paid for the wedding and honeymoon with his employers' credit card - and soon afterwards he started stealing from Letizia to help fund his taste for expensive cars and clothes. The court heard he took her £8,200 engagement ring 'to be cleaned' - but then pawned it for £2,000 before claiming to his insurers that it was lost and getting an £8,000 payout. For almost four years, Jarvie also stole the £1,000 his new wife paid him each month towards their mortgage. In total she lost £50,400 to the fraudster. Prosecutor Julian Kesner said: 'When she first started going out with him in 2005 she was not the only woman in his life. But they did settle down and they arranged to go on honeymoon which he paid for with the company credit card. The defendant paid for the wedding through the same company card. 'Immediately after the wedding, before they went on honeymoon, he said that he couldn't go because he had to go into hospital and as a consequence of that he didn't go home with her after the wedding. 'Nor could she arrange, although she wanted to, to go and visit him in hospital and she didn't actually see him there. His excuse was that he kept changing wards and doctors so she didn't see him. 'They bought a house together in Crawley [West Sussex] and agreed to settle the mortgage speedily by each paying £1,000 a month, a significant overpayment. He paid only the £600 interest on the mortgage.' Colin Jarvie was jailed for 27 months at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) yesterday after admitting seven charges of fraud and one of theft . Mr Kesner added: 'In August 2012 he asked to borrow £2,000 from her. She didn't agree but he took the money in any event. He was desperate for money. 'Also in August 2012 he asked her for her engagement ring, a diamond ring of some value. He said ""I want to get it cleaned"" and she gave over the ring but it was the last she saw of it. He pawned it for £2,000. 'Not only did Jarvie get an £8,000 payout from Aviva for the ring - he also tried to claim the loss on another policy with Direct Line but they turned him down.' 'No greater breach of trust can be imagined than a husband stealing from his wife.' Judge Jamie Tabor QC . Jarvie, originally from Motherwell, Lanarkshire but now of Chelmsford, Essex, also duped his employers, customers, insurance companies and a Cash Convertors shop during a campaign of fraud, the court heard. Sentencing Jarvie yesterday, Judge Jamie Tabor QC told him the most serious offences were those against his bride. He said: 'There you are, embarking on your marriage, and on the day of your honeymoon you conned your wife by saying you were not well enough to go. 'You spun her a yarn about being moved from hospital to hospital so she could not come and see you. Then you started stealing from her, That is unforgiveable. 'No greater breach of trust can be imagined than a husband stealing from his wife. 'Then, to cap it all, you take her engagement ring, saying you are going to get it cleaned, and you take it off to the pawnbroker and get £2,000 for it. 'Then comes the icing on the cake - you tell your insurers Aviva you have lost it and they pay you £8,000.' Prosecutor . Julian Kesner said Jarvie was a highly regarded employee at Socomec, a company . dealing in thermal imaging and disaster rescue equipment in Cirencester, . Gloucestershire. As well as a company car he had business credit cards, phones, a computer and other 'signficant' perks, said the prosecutor. After defrauding his wife and his employers, Jarvie was seen driving around in Range Rover (below) and an Audi RS4 sports car (above). File Photos . The company had no problems with him until 2012, but then they discovered he had spent £5,000 on personal items on his business credit card. They made an arrangement for them to repay him at £50 a week but he Jarvie kept failing to keep monthly appointments. Anomalies were then found in his expenses. As well as cheating the company out of a total of £24,000 - including another £7,900 on his credit card. He had also duped a customer, by selling him goods for £8,500 which he never received. He . abandoned his company car, an Audi A3, and drove around instead in . luxury vehicles including a Range Rover and an Audi RS4 sports car, the court heard. He had bought the Audi on credit and a county court judgement for £16,000 was made against him for defaulting on the payments. After showdown talks with bosses, Jarvie then went to a Cash Convertors store and sold some company equipment, the court heard. Mr Kesner said the total losses suffered by all Jarvie's victims was £92,000. Joe Maloney, defending, said Jarvie accepted his offences were 'dreadful' but he had started to make amends by signing over his £34,000 pension fund to his wife and also his £8,000 share of the equity in the house. He said Jarvie also suffered from an excess of iron and had to have a pint of blood removed from him every week.","Colin Jarvie started scamming wife Letizia Salaris soon after wedding .

"By . Wills Robinson . In the last 25 years, they have been to the moon and back, defeated an evil robotic dog and have even masterminded a prison escape. Now Wallace and Gromit are heading to a museum, and it could be one of the last settings for Britain's favourite animated duo. Never-before-seen drawings penned by creator Nick Park will be put on display in the M Shed in Bristol just days after hinting that he may bring the series to an end. They chart the Wensleydale-loving man and his dog from their inception in the late 1980s up until the first feature-length film, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit in 2005. The sketches were penned by animator Nick Park when he first came up with the idea for Wallace and Gromit . The initial idea began with just a plasticine master and his dog, before it developed into one of the most popular comedy franchises in television history . How they are today: The Wallace and Gromit we know and love haven't changed at all from the initial sketches . They include sketches from . when the British animator was in the first stages of developing the idea  - . which started as a plasticine master and his dog. The drawings show the dynamic duo in various forms, from scraggly drawings in pencil to more defined versions done in ballpoint pen. Some show Wallace trapped in a giant mousetrap, paddling on a lifeboat and using a remote controlled iron. The sketches, which will be unveiled for the first time tomorrow, chart the thinking of Park as he thought up different storylines for the duo. The show opens just days after Nick Park said he was 'unsure whether to continue' the cartoon franchise because of the ill health of Peter Sallis, 93, the voice of Wallace. The sketch book includes drawings of Preston, the robotic villain in A Close Shave . The designs, including ideas for inventions, will be displayed at the M Shed in Bristol . Merlin Crossingham, creative director of Wallace and Gromit at Aardman, said he was very excited to be holding an exhibition in the place where the characters were born. He said: 'This exhibition really does show off Bristol’s creative scene. It’s all about stories that were created here by people living in the city. 'But, as well as an exhibition, it will allow people to step into the story board and hopefully inspire creativity, as there will be opportunities for them to do some drawing. 'All of our ideas began as small doodles, and some of them were brought to life and can be seen here, so it would be great to inspire others to do the same. 'We are so excited to be able to hold this just down the road from where it’s all created: we always have such a warm response from people in Bristol.' Wallace reads the newspaper while Gromit drives to work in A Matter of Loaf and Death . The franchise began on Christmas Day 1989 with A Grand Day Out. The short film, which was aired on BBC, saw Wallace and Gromit planning a trip for the Bank Holiday, and decide on the moon. In order to get there, they build a rocket in the basement of their fictional, semi-detached home. Landing on the lunar surface, they encounter a moving fridge that follows them around during their stay. A famous line comes when they leave for Earth, with Wallace telling Gromit: 'No crackers Gromit... we've forgotten the crackers.' The film lasted just 23 minutes, but the characters would grow into mainstays of Christmas television in the UK. The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave, The Curse of the Were Rabbit and A Matter of Loaf and Death all followed and were huge successes. They are constantly repeated when it comes to the festive period. Throughout the 25 years on air, they have received a huge number of accolades and broke a number of viewing records: . A Grand Day Out - 1989 (was nominated for Best Animated Film at Academy Awards, but lost out to Creature Comforts, which is also a Nick Park creation) The Wrong Trousers - 1993 (won the Academy Award for Best Short Film) A Close Shave - 1995 (also won the Academy Award for Best Short Film) The Curse of the Were Rabbit - 2005 (the first feature length film, lasting 88 minutes) A Matter of Loaf and Death - 2008 (topped the BBC Christmas Day viewing figures with an average of 14.4million viewers) Other characters that can be seen include . one of the slugs from Creature Comforts, Shaun the Sheep, and Preston, . the robot dog from A Close Shave. Original sets from The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave will also be on display, as well as props from the hit show. But . it’s not just props from the show that are going up for display. Visitors will also be able to see the Oscar and Bafta awards that the . show have won. Tim Corum, deputy director of Bristol Museums, Galleries and Archives, said: 'We are so excited to be able to host this event. One set includes a living room scene where Gromit uses the vacuum while Wallace sits back and relaxes . Gromit stands up next to a cooker and a number of consoles which were set up in the basement of their house . Merlin Crossingham, Creative Director of Wallace and Gromit, makes some final adjustments to the model of Lady Campanula Tottingham, who featured in The Curse of the Were Rabbit . The set may be one of the last chances to see the models, as the show's creators, Aardman Animations, are considering bringing the story to an end . 'It’s something different that we hope everyone will be able to enjoy. The story behind Wallace and Gromit is an inspiring one, with groups of friends coming together to create something so successful, we hope it will inspire more creativity in the city. We know it’s there.' The display includes some ideas that are yet to be used, including a hover-car, a stretch limo and a scene depicting Wallace and Gromit in a floating bath tube. Speaking previously Mr Park has said Wallace was inspired by his dad, who loved tinkering in the shed. Visitors will be allowed to peer into the sets. One is of Gromit measuring his prized marrow from The Curse of the Were Rabbit . The creators said they were 'very excited' that people would be able to see 'where the characters were born' Wallace and Gromit creator Nick Park grew up drawing cartoons and started making films with his mother when he was 13 . Nick Park was the creative mind behind one of the most successful stop-motion film projects in history. He was born in Lancashire (which is why he originally wanted Wallace to have a Lancastrian accent). He grew up with a keen interest in drawing cartoons and would make films with the help of his mother when he was 13-years-old. He studied Communication Arts at Sheffield City Polytechnic (now Sheffield Hallam University) and then went to the National Film and Television School, where he started making the first Wallace and Gromit short film, A Grand Day Out. In 1985, he joined Aardman Animations in Bristol, where he worked as an animator. One of his first projects was on Peter Gabriel's video for his track, Sledgehammer. As he worked on the first Wallace and Gromit film, he made Creature Comforts, where zoo animals were matched with the voices of people talking about their home lives. His first Wallace and Gromit feature, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, was released on 5 October 2005, and won Best Animated Feature Oscar at the Academy Awards, in 2006 . On 10 October 2005, a fire gutted Aardman Animations' archive warehouse. The fire resulted in the loss of most of Park's creations, including the models and sets used in the movie Chicken Run. Some of the original Wallace & Gromit models and sets, as well as the master prints of the finished films, were elsewhere and survived.","Drawings by animator Nick Park when he first came up with idea for the pair .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A pair of fraudsters claimed their marriage had ended on their wedding night so they could live a life of luxury by falsely claiming more than £100,000 in benefits. Lesley Jones, 50, from Landore, Swansea, used the elaborate scam to swindle more than £108,000 in benefits, while she drove around in a BMW and took her family on expensive holidays. Her husband Thomas Jones, 52, claimed he had walked out on his wife on their wedding day in 2000, leaving Mrs Jones as a 'single mother'. Thomas Jones, 52, pictured left, and his wife Lesley, 50, pictured right, from Swansea, tried to hide their faces after being convicted of fraud for swindling for more than £100,000 in benefits at Swansea Crown Court . But the 'estranged' couple had been living together the whole time and even shared a bank account. All the bills at the home were paid by Mr . Jones - who claimed not to live there - while the payslips from his job . at Royal Mail were also sent to the house. Now the pair - who tried to hide their faces as they left Swansea Crown Court - have been convicted of fraud after a jury 'wholly rejected' their story. The court heard the scam began when Mrs Jones, a mother of five, started claiming income . support, employment support, tax credits and council tax relief by saying she was a single mother. Mr Jones played his part in the scheme by claiming he had walked out of their wedding reception and did not see his bride . again for two weeks after the wedding. The former Royal Mail worker - who the court heard was previously convicted for stealing post from his employer - said the pair remained apart after that. But while Mrs Jones was claiming the benefits, she drove a BMW with a personalised number plate and bought a £27,000 luxury caravan berthed in a seaside holiday park. During the trial, Swansea Crown Court heard there was also overwhelming evidence against the couple. At Swansea Crown Court, pictured above, Judge Keith Thomas jailed Mr . Thomas for 15 months and gave Mrs Thomas a 15 month sentence, suspended . for two years . Prosecutor Paul Hobson said Mr Jones's wages had been . sent to Mrs Jones's address, while the TV licence was also registered in his name. An expert told the trial that during one period, Mrs Jones received £79,308 in benefits -  but spent £190,721. The couple also only declared they were living together in 2011, once an investigation into the benefit fraud had started, the court was told. The jury also heard how Mrs Jones might have fraudulently claimed even more in benefits than the Government was aware. Mrs Jones has been claiming since 1996, but Department for Work and Pensions records only go back to 2002, the court was told. But Mrs Jones avoided being jailed . after Judge Keith Thomas took her children into consideration. She was given a 15-month jail term but it was suspended for two years. Her husband was jailed for 15 months for his part in the scam. Judge Thomas said: 'You worked together to hide the fact he was working and you were married and living as a couple. Each of you knew what the other was doing. 'It is a serious offence, benefits are there for people who genuinely need them.' Speaking of his decision to suspend Mrs Jones's sentence, he said: 'There is one reason and one reason only in your case, and that’s your children.' He also ordered Mrs Jones to complete 300 hours of unpaid work.","Thomas Jones, 52, and his wife Lesley, 50, swindled £108,000 in benefits .

"By . Steph Cockroft . The parents of a young woman who died after a heated row while alone with her violent ex-boyfriend said yesterday they were still seeking justice for her after a coroner recorded an open verdict. Rebecca Day, 23, was heard by neighbours in the flat below to shout ‘get your hands off me’ before a woman screamed. There was then the sound of furniture being moved and silence, an inquest heard. Rebecca Day, 23, known as Becky, was found hanged in her flat in Hull, . East Yorkshire, just after neighbours heard her shout 'get your hands . off me', an inquest has heard . Minutes later Liam Scott, 28, banged on their door to say Miss Day had tried to commit suicide. She was found lying fatally injured on the floor of an airing cupboard with a washing line rope hanging from above. Phil Day, Miss Day's father, attended the inquest into his daughter's death at Hull Coroners' Court where assistant coroner Rosemary Baxter recorded an open verdict . Miss Day died a day later in hospital. A post-mortem examination revealed she suffered a fatal brain injury caused by hanging. The coroner recorded an open verdict after stating the evidence indicated two possible explanations – suicide or the ‘potential intervention of another party’. Miss Day’s parents don’t believe she took her own life. Her engineer father Philip Day said after the hearing in Hull: ‘Anybody who listened to the evidence will be able to make their own conclusions. ‘I want the investigation to carry on until my daughter receives justice. She deserves justice.’ The inquest was told that weeks before Miss Day died last December Mr Scott had completed a four-month jail sentence for an attack in which he broke her nose. The popular waitress was ‘petrified’ of Mr Scott, who had repeatedly beat her during their three-year relationship. However, she was said to be in good spirits after starting a relationship with another man and had arranged for Mr Scott to collect his belongings from her flat in Hull. The inquest was told Mr Scott gave contradictory accounts of his actions that night and lied by claiming he had been drinking and smoking cannabis in the flat with Miss Day. Toxicology tests on her blood were clear. The pair were heard arguing in the hours before Miss Day was found dying early on December 29. Joseph Goodwin, who lived with Helen Everitt in the flat below, said: ‘I heard him shouting something about her having another boyfriend. He shouted “you won’t be going out with him tomorrow”.’ The block of flats where Miss Day was found hanged. Her neighbours say . they heard shouting and screaming in the hours and minutes leading up to . the incident . Liam Scott, 28, raised the alarm after Miss Day was found hanged. He had been released from prison one month earlier after attacking her . Just before 1am he said he heard Miss Day shouting ‘leave me alone, get your hands off me’. Mr Goodwin said: ‘Immediately after that I heard a scream like I had never heard before.’ Furniture was also heard to be moved and ‘then it went really quiet’. Miss Day’s mother Michelle Coates questioned Miss Everitt about Mr Scott’s account to police that he and his ex-girlfriend had not been rowing, but he had dozed off on the sofa and woke to discover her. Mrs Coates asked: ‘You say you heard arguing before he banged on the door, but he said he was fast asleep?’ Miss Everitt replied: ‘He lied, he lied.’ Mr Scott had told his neighbours he went out to buy beer and returned to find Miss Day hanging. He then changed his story and claimed he had fallen asleep. He refused to give evidence but a statement from him was read. Mr Scott was questioned on suspicion of murder and released without charge. Police said yesterday the inquiry was complete and the scientific evidence didn’t support that he could have hanged Miss Day. But coroner Rosemary Baxter said there was insufficient evidence to conclude ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ she committed suicide. She said the evidence ‘doesn’t fully and sufficiently disclose’ how Miss Day came to die.","Rebecca Day, 23, found hanged in her flat in Hull, East Yorkshire in December .

"By . Andrew Baldock . Captain Steve Borthwick has been named in the Saracens team for Saturday’s Heineken Cup final against holders Toulon in Cardiff. Borthwick suffered a pectoral muscle injury and went off during the second half of Saracens’ Aviva Premiership play-off victory over Harlequins last weekend.

"By . Matthew Morlidge . Follow @@MattMorlidge . After a solitary year at Liverpool ended with just eight appearances, it's safe to say that not many fans would have been expecting Gabriel Paletta to star at a World Cup. But eight years after his fateful season on Merseyside, the Argentine-born defender could be tasked with stopping his former team-mates with in Brazil. England take on Italy in their first group game in Manaus, and will be wary of the presence of Mario Balotelli and the guile of Andrea Pirlo. But what about another man included in the 30-man provisional squad, Paletta? Surprise: Gabriel Paletta was included in Italy's 30-man provisional World Cup squad . Eight years ago: And Paletta was signing on the dotted line at Liverpool, as a 20-year-old hopeful . Aged just 20, Paletta made the brave decision to join Liverpool in a £2million move from hometown club Banfield. Labelled as one for the future after starring in the Under 20 World Championships alongside Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero, the South American signed a four-year contract. 'Paletta is very tough and he's exactly the sort of player we need who will suit the Premiership,' Rafael Benitez said back in the summer of 2006. 'If you're talking about Liverpool, he's more like 'Carra' (Jamie Carragher) than Sami Hyypia.' Unfortunately for Paletta, he struggled to settle in England and played just three times in the Premier League, though he did manage to score in a League Cup game. A return to Argentina followed with domestic giants Boca Juniors benefitting from some solid displays, but it was Paletta's next move that has seen him thrust back into the English spotlight. Parma snapped up the 6'3"" defender, and he flourished working in a back three. Up and coming: Paletta was in the same Argentina youth side as Lionel Messi at the 2005 Under 20 World Cup . Ready for England: Paletta poses with manager Rafael Benitez and Fabio Aurellio upon signing on Merseyside . Rare high moment: Paletta celebrates his solitary goal for Liverpool against Reading in the League Cup . Due to his Italian ancesstors in Crotone, Paletta was deemed eligible for the national side - but only made his debut in March this year. Despite the 28-year-old's international inexperience, Cesare Prandelli had seen enough to warrant Paletta with a spot in his World Cup squad, and an opportunity to help the four-time champions conquer once again. Can he stop Daniel Sturridge, Steven Gerrard and Co? Will he make it? Paletta is hoping to make the 23-man final squad so he can take on England in Manaus .","Gabriel Paletta played just eight times for Liverpool in a season .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A coroner has criticised the Ministry of Defence for a series of failures which led to the deaths of two soldiers in a fire as they slept at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan. Privates Dean Hutchinson, 23, and Robert Wood, 28 - plus one survivor - were sleeping in a tented office so they could respond more quickly when vital supplies arrived. But in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2011 witnesses could smell smoke and went out to see flames engulfing the air-conditioned canvas unit. Tragic: Privates Dean Hutchinson, 23 (left), and Robert Wood, 28 (right), died in the fire on February 14, 2011 . Today David Ridley, Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner, condemned a string of 'contributory factors' to the deaths - including a broken fire alarm. The MoD now has 56 days to reply in writing with details of actions that have been taken to prevent future similar deaths. Pte Wood, known as Woody, had become a . father to a boy, Noah, shortly before he died. He was a driver port . operator, posted to 17 Port and Maritime Regiment, and lived in . Hampshire. Pte Hutchinson, from County Durham, was a driver and had seven years’ service with the Army. The inquest heard that both senior . commanders and fire safety officers did not know the soldiers were . sleeping on duty during night shifts at the base in Helmand Province. Witnesses described struggling to get hold of emergency services when they saw the Transport Troop unit was ablaze. Private Sikeli Ratu, who was woken by . the smell of smoke, fled the canvas tent to raise the alarm but soldiers at the scene did not know the emergency 222 number. He told the court he . could hear Pte Hutchinson calling his name. By . the time firefighters arrived at the scene, the blaze had taken hold of . the tent, with flames approximately 3ft high and only the metal tent . poles remaining of the structure. They had been sleeping in the canvas tent in Camp Bastion (pictured) to be closer to vital supplies being delivered . Fire . investigators have concluded that the blaze started in the vicinity of . the electrical appliances - including a 32in flat-screen TV, boiler and fridge, and a nearby air conditioning unit. The fire quickly spread, igniting combustible . materials stored nearby, the court heard. Recording a narrative conclusion, Mr Ridley listed the seven errors that led to the deaths of Pte Hutchinson and Pte Wood: . 'The . systemic failure by the chain of command to communicate the occurrence . of sleeping on duties at night to key personnel, such as the unit fire . safety officer, as safety measures associated with this practice to all . Transport Troop personnel. 'The failure to police the occurrence of sleeping on duties at night through the use of random checks. 'The . failure to effectively check the working functionality of the nine-volt . smoke detector located inside the tent where the fire started, . resulting in it not being in working order at the time of the fire. 'The . systemic failure to provide effective training, especially to fire . NCOs, to identify the potential risk of the overloading of sockets and . extension blocks. The MoD now has 56 days to make or plan measures to prevent future similar deaths of soldiers . 'The . failure to rectify the error in the December 2010 fire risk assessment, . when it became known that sleeping was taking place within the tent in . December 2010. 'The failure to request a fresh fire risk assessment following the structural alterations that took place in January 2011. 'The absence of the Transport Troop tent from the theatre asset register.' The court heard senior officers were not certain who was responsible for checking the smoke detectors in the Transport Troop tent. It also emerged senior officers were not certain who was responsible for checking the smoke detectors in the Transport Troop tent. The rear of the Transport Troop tent was not permanently sealed and could be opened by unzipping the fire retardant inner lining and undoing the toggles to the canvas door. But the rear door to the adjacent Quartermaster’s tent was tied up tightly and also padlocked, the inquest was told.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Britain's biggest colony of leafcutter ants has self-destructed after chewing through a power cable in its tank. More than a million of the tropical insects - who can carry 20 times their weight in their jaws - had been living at Butterfly World near St Albans, Hertfordshire. They were dominated by a giant queen ant, the size of a small mouse, who was protected by an inner circle of soldier ants. Disaster: Britain's biggest colony of leafcutter ants has self-destructed after chewing through a power cable in its tank. Above, a worker ant at Butterfly World near St Albans, Herfordshire, where the incident happened . But in recent weeks, some of the ants had started nibbling on a power lead in their glass cabinet, which was linked to a water tank regulating their temperature. They finally bit through the lead and sent an electric current shooting through the colony - killing the queen and her soldier guards. Most of the worker ants escaped the shock as they were in a separate part of the enclosure cutting leaves. But carnage erupted when they returned to find the queen and her inner circle dead. Without a queen to protect, fighting broke out and the leaderless ants started dying in huge numbers as they killed each other or starved to death. Wildlife park: More than a million of the tropical insects had been living at Butterfly World (pictured) at the time . At work: Most of the worker ants escaped the shock as they were in a separate part of the tank. But carnage erupted when they returned to find the queen and her 'soldiers' dead. Above, a leafcutter ant at the wildlife park . And within two months, every single member of the colony at the wildlife park was dead. Butterfly World spokeswoman Sally Cornish said there was nothing staff could have done to help the ants after their queen was killed. 'It was a freak accident. The ants are quite adventurous and I guess some of them took a fancy to the wire,' she said. 'The electric shock killed the queen, who was the size of a small mouse. Once that happened, everything changed. 'The ants started wandering around aimlessly because they had no queen to protect. They sort of lost their purpose in life. It was horrible to watch them all dying. Cutting leaves: Without a queen to protect, fighting broke out and the leaderless ants started dying as they killed each other or starved to death. Within two months, every single member of the colony was dead . 'Afterwards we dug into the tank to see if we could find her body but she wasn’t there. We think the ants probably ate her after she died. 'We are all really sad about it because they were characters and although they could be a real nuisance they were part of Butterfly World.' Ms Cornish added that the power lead had been inside the tank for four years and was a commonly-used method of controlling its temperature. The park has now hired an ant specialist to find a replacement queen in the rainforest in Trinidad in a bid to start building a new leafcutter ant colony.","More than a million leafcutter ants lived at Butterfly World near St Albans .

"By . Sam Webb . A young woman hanged herself after struggling to cope with the heartbreak of her mother committing suicide just nine months before, an inquest has heard. Sarah Babic was so upset by the death of her mother Lorraine, who had suffered with multiple sclerosis for nearly 40 years, and being unable to see her own 10-year-old daughter that she took her own life. The 31-year-old, of Thatcham, Berkshire,  had become increasingly unwell in the months leading up to her death and her weight had plummeted from 10 stone to just seven due to nausea and gallstones, the inquest heard. The deputy coroner for Berkshire, based at Royal Berkshire Hospital  in Reading (pictured), heard that Sarah, had lost custody of her daughter from her previous marriage and had been unable to see her . Lorraine, 57, had battled her debilitating condition since the age of 20 but decided to 'take control of her life' by hanging herself in March 2013. Sarah's father, Mike Babic, said in a statement: 'Her marriage breaking up and the loss of custody of her daughter hit her hard and the death of her mother also hit her hardest of all as they had been very close and (she was)  a great source of support to Sarah.' Emma Jones, deputy coroner for Berkshire, heard that Sarah, had lost custody of her daughter from her previous marriage and had been unable to see her. Her fiancee, Simon Key, whom she lived with, said: 'Sarah rarely talked about her daughter but her ex-husband and his new partner were quite difficult about her having contact. 'Sarah's father intervened and they worked out an agreement where she could phone her daughter every Sunday in October 2013. It worked well for a few weeks but fell apart when Sarah called but there was no response and this upset her,' he said in a statement. 'Nine months before her death she lost her mother. This had a massive effect on Sarah.' The inquest, held in Newbury, Berkshire, heard that Sarah, who also has a younger sister Lizzy, had become unwell with gallstones and a hernia and had stopped eating normally, causing her weight to plummet. The 31-year-old, who lives in Grenadier Gardens, Thatcham, Berkshire, had become increasingly unwell in the months leading up to her death and her weight had plummeted . An operation on her gallstones three weeks before her death had been successful but she reported still feeling sick during appointments with her doctor. On December 27 she had been due to attend an emergency doctor's appointment arranged by her father at 4pm. Mr Key had left for work at HMV early that morning, with Sarah going to bed at 8.30pm the previous night due to her nausea. He had checked on her at 11.30pm and saw her sleeping, the last time she was seen alive. Mr Babic sent her a text message telling her to pack an overnight bag at 9.25am and she replied. Mr Key also sent her a message at 10.42am to see if she was alright but she did not reply. When Mr Babic went to pick Sarah up at around 3.30pm she did not answer the door. He climbed in through an open downstairs window and discovered his daughter hanging. Despite attempts by Mr Babic and paramedics to revive her, Sarah was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Thames Valley Police investigated the death but found no third party involvement. No suicide notes were recovered from the house. Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl, Home Office pathologist, found that Sarah was 'slightly built but adequately nourished' at the time of her death. He concluded she had died from hanging. Mr Key told the inquest: 'After her mother died she made a passing comment about having suicidal thoughts but that was the only mention she ever made of it. 'I loved her to bits and I still do. She was everything to me and has left a huge gap in my life.' Mr Babic said his daughter had suffered from depression since the age of 18 years and had been on medication. She had attempted to kill herself with an overdose eight years before and had occasionally self-harmed. 'Sarah had initially responded fairly well after my wife's passing away and she was very supportive,' he said. 'We enjoyed some nice times over the summer and had a nice holiday in Ireland in July. It was my plan when I made the emergency appointment to get her into hospital to have treatment (for her sickness) but she beat me to it.' In recording a verdict of suicide, Mrs Jones said: 'The recent death of her mother appeared to have affected Sarah greatly and the lack of contact with her own child was hard for her.' Speaking after the inquest, Mr Babic, an operations manager at Mixing Solutions in Hambridge Lane, Newbury, reiterated how close his wife and daughter had been. 'We are in the process of laying Sarah to rest in a plot next to her mother,' he said. 'She is reunited with her mother.'","Sarah Babic, 31, was grief-stricken after death of mother Lorraine , 57 .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . England’s attention to detail for the World Cup will see a delegation of more than 70 going to Brazil in the official FA party. A sign that the backroom staff would be bigger than ever for a major tournament was the numbered, Nike-supplied luggage carried by World Cup-bound FA personnel at the training week in the Algarve. The suitcase tally was as high as 59 for the support team and the senior coaching group have been given initialled luggage rather than numbered cases. Numbers one to 23 are reserved for Roy Hodgson’s squad, so their World Cup shirt numbers announced on Thursday correspond to the figures on their bags. Cast of thousands: England will take a plethora of staff to the World Cup . The FA say their 70-plus party is smaller than other countries’, although the extra emphasis on sports science increases the number that went to South Africa in 2010. The estimated breakdown is 23 players plus two on standby, one manager, three coaches, one performance chief, one psychiatrist, two sports scientists and two exercise scientists. One physio, three masseurs, three video analysts, three kit managers, one doctor, one nutritionist, one osteopath, one chef, four security personnel, two administrators, one travel manager and one commercial expert. Six from communications, six international committee members, a sponsor and four Club England officials. Pampered: The likes of Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard will have their every need cared for in Brazil . Conspicuous by his absence from the lavish BBC theatre tribute to the late, great broadcaster David Coleman was Des Lynam, widely regarded as the most accomplished sports TV host since Coleman. The pair never got on for a number of reasons, including professional rivalry. There is upset among Yorkshire’s 40 honorary life members and vice-presidents, who include England greats Geoff Boycott, Michael Vaughan, Bob Appleyard, Ray Illingworth, Brian Close and Darren Gough, that they will not have automatic access to the VIP hospitality Hawke Suite during the Sri Lanka Test at Headingley. Yorkshire say their boardroom facility is too small when the ECB hierarchy are also being entertained and the former stars have all received invites for at least one day of the Test. New Yorkshire president Dickie Bird has chosen the ECB’s managing director Paul Downton to be a guest. Honourary guest: ECB managing director Paul Downton (left) will be at the Sri Lanka Test at Headingley . Two representatives plus partners from each Football League club will attend the Tivoli Marina Hotel in Vilamoura for the FL’s so-called summer meeting, although the dedicated vacation hotel overlooking marina and beach is an unlikely conference setting. At least the FL have dropped the charade of claiming their beano is cheaper than holding the two-day summit at home. Scholes seeks spotlight . The most surprising media contract in recent times involves Paul Scholes, who shunned the limelight throughout his stellar football career. The former Manchester United midfielder has signed up to do a World Cup blog for bookmakers Paddy Power, who are the most ravenous of publicity seekers. In the spotlight: Scholes (left) has emerged as an unlikely media personality . It seems Scholes now wishes to heighten his profile. He claimed on TV that Jack Wilshere had not improved since he was 17 and blogged on Thursday that Wayne Rooney ‘isn’t great with partnerships’. Ding Junhui, winner of five snooker tournaments last season, missed the sport’s awards dinner at London’s Royal Lancaster Hotel, just as Luis Suarez had skipped collecting the Footballer of the Year trophy at the same venue.

B teams competing in a fifth-tier League Three — the central plank of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission proposals — looks to have been kicked into the long grass by the FA themselves.

The Northern Irishman, 42, stepped down on Thursday having led the club to three Scottish Premiership titles during his four-year spell in charge. His former team-mate Larsson immediately became one of the front runners for the post. On his way: Neil Lennon quit Celtic this week . Speaking to Sky Sports and STV at Glasgow airport before jetting out to Lisbon for the Champions League final with the Lisbon Lions, who won the European Cup for Celtic in the city in 1967, Lennon was asked if the former Sweden striker, now manager of Falkenbergs in his homeland, was ready to step into his shoes. He said: 'You will need to ask Henrik that but if he does I am sure he will be a huge success. Why not? Next in line? Henrik Larsson has been mentioned as a possible replacement for Lennon . 'He's had a fabulous career as a player, he is a very intelligent guy and knows the game very well.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron ruled out doing a deal with Ukip as he came under fresh pressure from Tory MPs to stem losses at the general election. Tory MPs fear that without an electoral pact with Nigel Farage - which would see Ukip agree not to stand against Eurosceptic Conservatives - Labour could take power next year. But the Prime Minister insisted: 'We're the Conservative party, we don't do pacts or deals, we're fighting all out.' David Cameron, touring a warehouse today, insisted he understood the message from voters who chose to back Ukip . Labour ousted the Tories from Hammersmith and Fulham, a flagship authority in the capital, and also gained the key target London borough of Croydon from the Conservatives. Downing Street took comfort from seeing off the Labour threat in Swindon and Thurrock, but Ukip gains robbed them of overall control in Maidstone, Peterborough, Basildon, Castle Point and Southend. However Ukip gains  cost the Tories control in Maidstone, Basildon, Peterborough, Castle Point and Southend-on-Sea. Conservative MP . Douglas Carswell said: ‘We need a pact with Ukip. If David Cameron is . as serious about an in/out vote in 2017 as he says he is, and if Nigel . Farage is as serious about Brexit as he claims, the two of them need to . do a deal,’ he said. Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC: 'In a first-past-the-post system, if they don't get those votes into one pot, then both those sides end up losing.' WINS: Increasing majority in Swindon, a major Labour target. Clung on in Tamworth after losing just one seat to Ukip. Won Kingston upon Thames from the Lib Dems. LOSSES: Labour taking Hammersmith and Fulham is a big blow. Maidstone and Peterborough slipped into no overall control after Ukip gains. Brentwood, in Eric Pickles' backyard, now no overall control, alongside other south Essex councils Basildon, Castle Point and Southend. But speaking in his Oxfordshire constituency, Mr Cameron insisted he would not do a deal. 'We're the Conservative party, we don't do pacts or deals, we're fighting all out for an all out win at the next election,' he said. But he conceded that the public were 'frustrated' with the political establishment's failure to address their concerns. 'People want us to deliver,' he said. 'The economy is growing, we are creating jobs, but we have got to work harder and we have got to really deliver on issues that are frustrating people and frustrating me, like welfare reform and immigration and making sure people really benefit from this recovery. 'We will be working flat out to demonstrate that we do have the answers to help hard working people.' Tory backbencher John Baron - MP for Basildon and Billericay - said Mr Cameron was still making mistakes and ceding ground to Ukip. 'Whilst accepting that Ukip is in part a protest vote, the political establishment has been too complacent over the EU. It must now heed the message from these elections,' he said. 'No 10 must learn from past mistakes. First it tried to ignore, and then insult, Ukip. It then took our backbench campaigns to get a referendum, and then support for legislation. 'But even now mistakes are being made. We have immigration targets, yet cannot control the major EU component. 'We also need to make clearer that there will be no deal with Ukip.' Tory party chairman Grant Shapps insisted: 'We’re not going to have a pact or joint candidates, or whatever. 'No 10 must learn from past mistakes. We have immigration targets, yet cannot control the major EU component' 'It can’t happen on a technical basis because we do not allow joint candidates to stand... It’s not going to happen because we’re the Conservative party; we are the best chance to offer an in/out referendum, the only chance.' Education Secretary Michael Gove told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I don’t think we should have a pact. 'I think we should seek to get every individual who is concerned about the best future for this country to support David Cameron as the next Prime Minister and the best way to do that is to vote Conservative. 'We appreciate and understand why people have voted Ukip, and in government we will make sure that we deliver on the priorities that people have clearly set out. 'There’s a clear instruction from people on us to deliver. I understand why some people have been angry in the past about the failure of government, but now that we’re in a position to deliver, we should.' Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove said the loss of votes to Ukip was a 'clear instruction from people on us to deliver' Defeat . by Ukip had been expected to renew pressure on Mr Cameron to toughen up . on Europe and immigration.

"UEFA president Michel Platini insists the move to impose financial fair play sanctions against Manchester City is an historic moment for football - even if the club are furious at the punishment. City will have a heavy fine, a reduced Champions League squad and a limit on transfer spending for next season, while Paris St Germain have been given the same sanctions. Platini told Sky Sports News: 'The people at Manchester City are not happy, the people of PSG, they are not happy, but I think Manchester United, Everton, they are happy. UEFA president: Michel Platini has defended Financial Fair Play . 'It's very subjective. We have to follow the regulations but I think it's an historical moment and a good moment for football. 'My wish is not to kill the clubs. We have fair play to help the clubs have better governance. 'I'm not the person who decides... but I think it would be a big mistake if we banned the clubs because financial fair play is to help them - not to kill them.' Meanwhile, Platini said he was still considering whether to run for the FIFA presidency but that he expects Sepp Blatter to stand for another term. He added: 'After the World Cup, it will be enough to think about that. I have all the World Cup, all the holidays, to think where I want to stay in the future.

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . George Groves is predicting a third-round knockout of Carl Froch in their mega rematch at Wembley on Saturday week, not another controversial ending to their Battle of Britain for the world super middleweight title. The 25-year-old Londoner remains supremely confident that he will end the reign of the Nottingham Cobra, so much so that he is in dispute with his own bullish trainer as to how soon he will inflict the stoppage. Groves said: ‘I can’t see it going longer than three rounds, but Paddy Fitzpatrick thinks Carl will last until the fifth. Scroll down for videos... Rematch: George Groves claims he will knockout Carl Froch in round three when the two meet again . ‘I guess it depends on how Froch approaches it. He may try to take it as long as possible in the false belief that I will blow up in the later rounds.’ Groves was ahead on the scorecard, having floored Froch with a massive right hand in the first round in Manchester last November, before referee Howard Foster declared a hasty stoppage in the champion’s favour in the ninth. And Groves says: ‘To tell you the truth I was in better physical condition than Carl at that point, even though he did enjoy some success in that round. ‘I had been giving him the beating of his life and he was in more trouble than me. ‘There will be no escape this time. We will have neutral officials (the referee remains a matter of dispute) so I won’t be a victim of the myths that I’m chinny and short on stamina.’ Shock to the system: George Groves floored Carl FRoch with a massive right in the first round of their first fight . As well as increasing his workrate with Fitzpatrick he has brought in a physical conditioning expert for the first time. Of his improvement under Barry O’Connell, as well the result of his extended period in camp with Fitzpatrick, he says: ‘Carl thinks I’m not a 12-round fighter but it’s so different in the gym this time. I’m going 15-20 rounds in sparring and it’s effortless. I’ve never done that before but this time, with the same good sparring partners, I’m finding it much easier.’ Although his new promoters, the German giants Sauerland, have no official role for Wembley, Groves is taking their counsel as to who should replace Jack Reiss, the referee who has been vetoed by Froch and his promoter Eddie Hearn. Controversial: The first fight was ended by referee Howard Foster in the ninth round to much surprise . He suspects that Reiss may be too strict for the taste of the Froch camp, saying: ‘There is some evidence that Carl is being advised by his trainer (Rob McCracken) to rabbit punch. It seemed like it happened in his big fight with Andre Ward. Since the change in the referee we think it’s best to draw attention to that. All I want is a fair neutral.’ Froch does not have a reputation for foul play and the Ward fight in the final of the Super Six super welterweight series remains one of his only two defeats. Such is Groves' confidence that he insists: ‘Not only am I going to knock Carl out but I would beat every other super middleweight in the world. That includes Ward even though he would be tougher than Froch.’","George Groves claims he will knockout Carl Froch in the third round .

Hamilton and Rosberg have known one another since their karting days, even working as team-mates, before reuniting last year following the former's arrival at Mercedes. The duo have always been civil and cordial towards one another, but as time has worn on this season that has shown signs of slowly changing. Scroll down for videos... Frenemies: Lewis Hamilton (R) and Nico Rosberg (L) could fall out in race for the Driver's Championships . Hamilton's four successive victories, following Rosberg's early win in Australia where the Briton retired, have propelled the 29-year-old into a three-point lead over the German. Rosberg has been forced to settle for the runner-up spot behind his team-mate on each occasion, and it is clear that this has rankled. Undeniably their battle for supremacy at present lacks the ferocity of F1's bitterest intra-team rivalry between Prost and Ayrton Senna in 1988-89 when the duo raced for McLaren. But asked by Press Association Sport about the Hamilton/Rosberg scrap, Prost smiled and said: . 'They are having a nice battle at the moment. 'It's good for Formula One, and with one team dominating they are letting them race, although I don't know how long that's going to be the case. 'The good thing is if they continue to dominate the same way then they can let them race until the end. For sure, it's a risk to their relationship. Drving ambition: Lewis Hamilton (front) has a three point lead over the German in the F1 title race . 'On the other hand, if Red Bull come back and perform better they can decide a few races before the end and say 'Okay, we're going to have a number one and a number two'. 'That's going to be a very complex situation because the last race is worth 50 points. 'That is a rule I do not like, but maybe it will help the championship, you never know.' With Hamilton at present in the ascendancy, Prost has revealed he had a chat with Rosberg following the recent Spanish Grand Prix. Hamilton won from pole, but conceded Rosberg - who finished just 0.6secs adrift after more than 300 kilometres of racing - was the better man over the course of the weekend. 'I talked to him on Sunday night, and there are a few things he can do,' revealed Prost. 'First of all he understands he needs to be on pole and start the race first. Speaking from experisnce: Alain Prost (L) had an intense intra-team rivalry with Ayrton Senna (R) in the 1980s . 'There were at least two races where he was a little bit quicker than Lewis, but you know how difficult it is with the same car, with no mistakes. It's tough. 'Right now it's very tight, and it's going to be very tight. But just because Lewis has won four times consecutively, that doesn't mean things cannot change. 'The thing with Lewis is he is using 100 per cent of his potential, and Nico understands he needs to do something a bit different. At least he knows he needs to change a few things, but we are only talking by a couple per cent. Nothing more.'","Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg risk a bust up, warns Alain Prost .

"By . Julian Robinson . They are the obsessive twins who are so close they have not been apart for more than 30 minutes in 15 years - and even once shared the same boyfriend. Amy and Becky Glass, 46, share everything, including a joint Facebook profile, a bedroom, the same mobile phone and a business they run together in a shared home office. They go to extremes to be mirror images of each other - and wear the exact same outfit every day in slightly different colours. Scroll down for video . Amy and Becky Glass are so close they haven't been apart for more than 30 minutes in 15 years . The pair say they are not interested in relationships anymore, and feel like they are married to one another. Incredibly, Amy and Becky have been measuring out every bite of food and sip of drink using scales and measuring cups for 19 year, to ensure their body-shapes and weights stay the same. For the past 19 years Amy and Becky  have been eating and drinking the same amount of food - carefully weighing out meals and pouring drinks using measuring cups. The sisters, from Los Angeles, USA, said: 'It's really like we're one person in two bodies. 'We go bite for bite - and we warn each other when the last bite will be so we know when the other is full. The 46-year-old twins, pictured right in their childhood, and to the left as adults, share everything, including a joint Facebook profile, a bedroom, the same mobile phone -and once even shared a boyfriend . As well as sharing a bedroom, the pair work in the same office and their desks even face one another - meaning they sleep, live and work together around the clock . 'If Becky doesn't want dessert, I won't have it . We either talk each other into it or out of it. 'At one point I weighed a little bit more than Becky, so people would say that I was the bigger twin and we hated it. 'We decided to go on diets and we have both weighed the same weight ever since.' Growing up, their mother dressed them in identical outfits. In high school they continued to dress alike, but decided to stop when they were bullied for it. After starting college at Rutgers University in 1986, in New Jersey, they went back to matching because they hated looking different. Amy said: 'We felt completely off being in different outfits - I felt like more of myself when I matched my sister, it was natural. The 46-year-olds, pictured brushing their teeth at the same time, even share a bedroom . 'But we decided to make a slight twist - choosing to wear the same outfit in two colours. 'We prefer it so much, because we are the same size, so we can swap clothes. 'It’s like we get two outfits each every time we shop, because we can mix and match on different days.' In 1993, they met a their ex-boyfriend Chris at a party. Amy said: 'We dated at the same time, all three of us - he was always taking both of us out. 'He was the one guy that both of us had sex with, however, most of the time we took it at the same times. 'As twins with a connection, we kind of just knew instinctively who was in the mood that night. The pair say they are not interested in relationships anymore, and feel like they are married to one another . 'We never felt jealous of one another, because he would never choose between us.' Amy and Becky haven't gone on a date alone in more than 10 years and have ruled out getting married and having children. Amy said: 'We thought about adopting a child and raising it together but we quickly decided against it. 'We love to travel and it's just too big of a responsibility. 'We don't want to get married because we don't have to answer to anybody.' The twins graduated with the same marketing degree in 1990, having shared a dorm room and the same group of friends. Now they love being their own bosses. Together they run their own marketing company GT Events in Los Angeles and always take conference calls together, often finishing each other's sentences .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Scientists have discovered 'enormous' fossilised sperm dating back 17 million years. Belonging to a tiny shrimp, the sperm, when uncoiled, was longer than the crustacean's entire body. The preserved semen were discovered at the Riversleigh World Heritage Fossil Site in Queensland, Australia, and are the oldest ever found. World's oldest: The world's oldest fossilised sperm has been discovered coiled up inside a tint shrimp. This image is a cross-section of 17 million year old fossil ostracod sperm. The nuclei in each sperm (dark spot) are indicated by arrows . The giant sperm are thought to have been longer than the length of the creature’s body but are tightly coiled up inside the sexual organs of the fossilised freshwater crustaceans, which are known as ostracods. ‘These are the oldest fossilised sperm ever found in the geological record,’ said Professor Mike Archer, of the University of New South Wales’ School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences. He has been excavating at Riversleigh for more than 35 years. ‘The Riversleigh fossil deposits in remote north-western Queensland have been the site of the discovery of many extraordinary prehistoric Australian animals, such as giant, toothed platypuses and flesh-eating kangaroos. So we have become used to delightfully unexpected surprises in what turns up there. An artist's impression of the site 17 million years ago. The cave was in the middle of a rainforest in an area that is now part of the Riversleigh World Heritage Fossil Site in Queensland, Australia. Tiny ostracods lived in a pool of water in the cave that was continually enriched by the droppings of thousands of bats . ‘But the discovery of fossil sperm, complete with sperm nuclei, was totally unexpected. It now makes us wonder what other types of extraordinary preservation await discovery in these deposits.’ A research team from the university collected the fossil ostracods from the Bitesantennary Site at Riversleigh in 1988. They were sent to John Neil, a specialist ostracod researcher at La Trobe University in Melbourne who realised they contained fossilised soft tissues. Experts including Dr Renate Matzke-Karasz from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, who authored the study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, examined the specimens at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. The microscopic study revealed the fossils contain the preserved internal organs of the ostracods, including their sexual organs. This is a sketch of a male ostracod, showing the organisation and orientation of the reproductive system . The creature's zenker organs - muscular pumps used to transfer the giant sperm to the female - were preserved. 'C' shows a scanning electron microscopic image of Riversleigh fossil ostracod on its left side, 'd' shows one of the creature's zenker organs and 'e' shows details of the zenker organ, including its chitinous rings marked as (cr) The microscopic study revealed that the fossils contain the preserved internal organs of the ostracods, including their sexual organs. Within these are the almost perfectly preserved giant sperm cells and within them, the nuclei that once contained the animals' chromosomes and DNA. The creature’s zenker organs – muscular pumps used to transfer the giant sperm to the female – were also preserved. The researchers estimate that the fossilised sperm are about 1.3 millimetres long, which is about the same length or slightly longer than the ostracod itself. ‘About 17 million years ago, Bitesantennary Site was a cave in the middle of a vast biologically diverse rainforest. Tiny ostracods thrived in a pool of water in the cave that was continually enriched by the droppings of thousands of bats,’ Professor Archer explained. 'About 17 million years ago, Bitesantennary Site was a cave in the middle of a vast biologically diverse rainforest. Tiny ostracods thrived in a pool of water in the cave that was continually enriched by the droppings of thousands of bats,' Professor Archer explained. The site of the fossil cave is pictured . Professor Suzanne Hand, a specialist in extinct bats and their ecological role in Riversleigh's ancient environments at the university, believes that the bats could have played a role in the preservation of the ostracod sperm cells. The steady rain of faeces from thousands of bats in the cave would have led to high levels of phosphorous in the water, which could have aided mineralisation of the soft tissues. ‘This amazing discovery at Riversleigh is echoed by a few examples of soft-tissue preservation in fossil bat-rich deposits in France. So the key to eternal preservation of soft tissues may indeed be some magic ingredient in bat droppings,’ Professor Hand said. Riversleigh has previously revealed insects with internal muscles that have been preserved because bacteria became fossilised as they attempted to consume the soft tissues of the creatures. Perfectly preserved cells of leaves have been found, as well as the preserved soft tissue of eyeballs in the eye sockets of some of the extinct marsupials.

Elle has introduced The Super Elixir by WelleCo, a range of alkalising food supplements, which she describes as her drug. The . new product was formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr . Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in . disease prevention. The . powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and . smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is . working to its optimum function. The body: Elle Macpherson is turning fifty this weekend and has unveiled her own super greens to celebrate . Speaking about the inspiration behind her new range, Elle said: 'I'm on the run a lot and if I'm not nourished, I don't feel good. 'For years, I was taking vitamins and powders. I tried alternative medicine, acupuncture, reflexology. 'I'm a pescatarian, I don't drink, do drugs or smoke so what else can I do? I wasn't unaware of wellness but something wasn't working for me and I told my doctor ""I don't feel great"". 'She told me my body was acidic, it was down to stress, travel and lack of sleep.' On the move: Speaking about the inspiration behind her new range, Elle said: 'I'm on the run a lot and if I'm not nourished, I don't feel good' Strength: 'The Super Elixir balances and strengthens me, to enable me to be the woman and mother I want to be, and now I want to share it!,' says Elle . That's when Elle decided to create the Super Elixir. The product, which costs £98 and launches on May 22 in Selfridges, is designed to support healthy nutrition at a cellular level and aid the digestive, endocrine (hormonal), circulatory and nervous systems. Packed with 45 key ingredients including alkalising super greens, Chinese herbs, and the miatake mushroom, Elle claims that just 10g of the powder daily contains all the vitamins, minerals and trace elements to assist wellness and vitally. 'I've spent years tweaking it and refining it and now the recipe works so beautifully. After a few weeks, my body went into cruise mode and I felt uplifted, lost weight, didn't get sick and didn't crave sugar. 'My body hummed along and functioned properly,' said Elle.

'Never having a coffee after lunch and drinking three litres of water a day is the most important tip I can give'. She also swears by the power of 'sport' - not exercise - for staying healthy. 'I call it sport not exercise and love anything that gets me outside, such as skiing, hiking, waterskiing, running, roadbiking and horse riding,' she said. 'I appreciate that it's much easier to do all this in America but I would recommend working out for 45 minutes per day, even if it's just a walk outside to get some fresh air.'

"By . Bianca London . Spend hours in the gym carving out abs good enough to grate cheese on but nowhere to show them off? Well maybe your body ifs good enough to be on the books of a new model agency called Ripped. As the name suggests, it's looking for well honed men and women who have an athletic body they want to showcase. How do you get noticed? Founder  James said it goes without saying that you have to have an amazing figure to be apart of the agency . The agency describes itself as an 'elite group of the UK’s fittest male and female fitness models and bodybuilders who either work in the fitness industry, are passionate about sports, are competitive bodybuilders or simply live for their next workout.' Ripped claims it's at the very cutting edge of fitness and specialise in fitness, underwear, sports, physique and fashion modelling. A lot of the 60 models on its books, who range from a 16-year-old to a 38-year-old, also go on to do swimwear, sportswear, protein bars and vitamin range campaigns. Most of the talent work as bodybuilders, circus performers, boxers, martial artists, fire-breathers and fire fighters and model in their free time. Peak physical condition: Ripped claims it's at the very cutting edge of fitness. One of their models, Adam, 26, is an example of this . Range of talent: A lot of the 60 models on its books go on to do swimwear, sportswear, protein bars and vitamins and supplement range campaigns . In shape: Speaking about the agency, the founder described fitness modelling as an 'art-form' The agency don't charge the models to be listed on its website and claim to only take a small commission when one of their models gets signed for a job. Speaking about setting up the agency, founder James Bishop said: 'I have always believed in physical fitness as a way of de-stressing and as a way of getting some good, quality time to yourself. 'I also enjoy seeing the results it brings. So, I decided to open the agency and it has gone from strength to strength in the short time it has been open.' 'Fitness modelling is an art-form,' he added. 'Just as an artist will put all his efforts into the final product, so do our guys and girls. They spend hours in the gym most days to reach perfection - and this is what our clients want. 'There are huge numbers of underwear brands, fitness equipment manufacturers and fashion labels who want models who are at the peak of their physical fitness. 'They want guys with abs of steel, powerful pecs and muscles on top of their muscles and ripped or defined girls who are the picture of health and fitness. 'Our models are dedicated to their training. Most of them work out in the gym as the basics, most supplement this with running, team sports and swimming. Some of our guys and girls are professional athletes and of course, some have full-time jobs. We have a firefighter, a serving soldier and, of course, we have lots of personal trainers on our books. They work out! Most of the models at Ripped work out in the gym as the basics and most supplement this with running, team sports and swimming or body building like Richard, pictured . 'There has been lots of media attention in recent years about the negative effect of using size-zero models, and there will always be a stereotype that models exist on one lettuce leaf a day. 'Our guys and girls are the opposite. They can eat up to 6,000 calories of nutritional - this is the keyword - food a day, but of course they burn it off through their exercise and training, leaving an amazing body which can potentially earn them thousands.' Speaking about the agency and getting noticed, James said: 'It goes without saying that you have to have an amazing figure. With guys, you can be a huge man-mountain of muscle like a really huge bodybuilder, or you can be slim and defined. Here come the girls: For girls to get noticed, James said you can be petite and slim, or again, bigger defined bodybuilders adding that 'as long as you look amazing, you will be fine' 'What you must have are impressive abs though, this is the true mark of a fitness model. 'For girls, you can be petite and slim, or again, bigger defined bodybuilders. As long as you look amazing, you will be fine. 'What sets us apart though is that we insist you are fun to work with, and are down to earth. We don't put up with divas and neither do we think much to dull personalities. 'If you look good, know how to stay calm and happy, love showing off your body then please get in touch.' For more information, visit rippedmodels.co.uk .","Ripped was set up by James Bishop .

"By . Lillian Radulova . and Freya Noble . Peters ice cream could become the latest iconic Australian brand this to be sold off after its parent company entered talks with a foreign investor. Unlike many of the other brands which are being snatched up by Asian buyers, Pacific Equity Partners is in exlcusive negotiations with French ice cream manufacturer, R&R. As the largest producer of ice cream in Europe - and the second largest in the world - R&R are  reported to have offered $450 million for Peters, according to The Australian. Scroll down for video . The iconic Australian ice cream brand, Peters, is the subject of negotiations this week as Pacific Equity Partners looks to sell it off to French ice cream giant, R&R . If the deal goes through, the French ice cream giant, located in the UK but owned by French private equity firm PAI Partners, will produce some of Australia's favourite treats including Drumstick, Billabong and Connoisseur. Pacific Equity Partners could nearly double their profits after they bought Peters for about $250 million from Nestle in 2012. The deal would also confirm that the company will not be floating Peters on the sharemarket, which had been expected. As the market leader in Australia's multi million dollar ice cream industry, Peters' revenue is projected to rise from $269.3 million in 2014 to $290.3 million in 2015, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. More than 100 years old, the brand is no doubt one of Australia's most iconic brands, founded in 1907 by Fred Peters in Manly. Over 100 years old, Peters is currently the market leader in Australia's multi million dollar ice-cream industry, responsible for well-loved desserts including Drumsticks and Billabong . Australian entrepreneur Dick Smith has spoken out for the second time this week about the damage foreign ownership is doing to Australian brands. His first statements came on Wednesday when Meadowlea announced it was moving offshore, Smith saying the move was a blow to Australian customers. On Friday in light of iconic Australian brand Peters' potential sale, the business owner told the Sydney Morning Herald that his 'company's days are numbered.' 'I think the days are numbered because basically anyone who is any good as a food producer is pretty much immediately bought out by the Northern Hemisphere. These companies have to get growth and the only way they can get growth is by buying out other companies,' he said. Australian businessman Dick Smith said foreign ownership is hurting Australian brands and Dick Smith Foods will be forced to close . Smith also told of the struggle to source produce from local companies, and the impact this is having on consumers who want home-grown products. 'This is going to happen more and more where in the end Dick Smith Foods is going to be forced to close,' he told the publication. Earlier this week, Australian-made Meadow Lea margarine and bread brands Helgas and Wonder White, were also announced to be falling into foreign hands after Asian investors bid $1.37 billion. The companies, owned by Goodman Fielder, could be moved offshore in as little as four months as the company board paves the way for Singapore oils trader Wilmar International and Hong Kong investment house First ­Pacific to enter into a takeover. Smith also revealed it's getting harder and harder to source local produce for his company . Goodman Fielder owns and operates sugar refineries in North Queensland and Victoria, and the company employs about 6000 people in Australia, NZ and Asia. A statement from Goodman Fielder released on Thursday said a recommendation had been put to its board to accept a takeover bid from the two Asian investors at 71 cents a share. Goodman Fielder has a portfolio of well-known consumer brands in some of Australia's largest grocery categories, including Meadow Lea, Praise, White Wings, Pampas, Mighty Soft, Helga's, Wonder White, Meadow Fresh and Irvines. If the buy-out proceeds, the once proudly-owned Australian food brands will join the long list of former iconic products Cottees Cordials, milk brands Dairy Farmers and Dare Iced Coffee, Bushells and Nerada Teas and big biscuit manufacturer Arnott's to fall into foreign hands. No longer: After 75 years in Australian hands the margarine spread on every Australian fridge shelf will soon be owned by Asian investors .","Pacific Equity Partners rumoured to have been offered $450 million by French ice cream giant R&R .

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Sarah Dean . Career criminal Christopher Dean 'Badness' Binse is back behind bars after stealing $235,000 from a Melbourne hotel and shooting at police in a 44-hour siege. The hardened thug threatened two armed guards with a sawn-off shotgun during the armed robbery in March 2012 and pulled a gun on plain clothes police officers he thought were assassins sent to kill him. When police tracked him to his home in Melbourne's north-western suburbs in May 2012, he fired at them sporadically over 44 hours before teargas ended the dramatic stand-off. Scroll down for video . Banged up: Christopher Binse is back in jail after stealing $235,000 from a Melbourne hotel and shooting at police in a 44-hour siege . The 45-year-old was just 24 when a Victorian judge first told him to stop robbing banks and stay out of jail. But 21 years later, he clearly hasn't learnt his lesson. His most recent convictions are the latest chapter in a criminal history that has led to Binse spending more than half his 45 years in jail. Victorian Supreme Court Justice Terry Forrest said on Friday that Binse's prospects for rehabilitation were poor. The seige: Video footage showed 'Badness' shooting at police officers during a stand-off on 23 May 2012 . Not backing down: Mr Binse kept the seige going for 44-hours at an East Keilor home in Melbourne's north west . 'Your prior record and the gravity of your current offending necessarily leads me to conclude that the community needs to be protected from you,' he said. 'There is obviously a powerful need to deter you from reoffending.' He sentenced the Keilor East man to 18 years and two months in jail, with a non-parole period of 14 years and two months. Justice Forrest quoted former Victorian County Court judge Leo Lazarus, who in sentencing Binse in 1993 said his offending was 'about as bad as bank robberies can be'. Justice Forrest said Binse's armed robbery and police siege had put lives in danger. 'When such crimes are committed, they cause terror to those immediately involved and apprehension in the wider community,' Justice Forrest said. Not afraid: Chris Bines has served 28 of the past 32 years in some form of detention . Shocking: A police photo shows the guns, pistols, ammunition and explosives that were tendered to the court in the Binse case . 'You fired at or near police officers who were simply doing their job.' The 45-year-old pleaded guilty to charges including armed robbery and possessing guns. He had also been charged with making a threat to kill police who confronted him at La Porchetta restaurant, in Nidrie, in Melbourne's north-west, but was acquitted in a February trial. When police searched his storage unit after he was arrested in May 2012, they found an arsenal of weapons, including a 1928 'Tommy gun' sub-machinegun. Binse told police he had the guns because he feared for his life after a prisoner, who cannot be named, threatened to kill him. The notorious armed robber is famous for once taunting police with a newspaper ad, 'Badness is Back', the day after he committed an armed robbery. Binse has a habit for telling his victims: 'Thanks very much.' He once sent Christmas cards to detectives, showing Santa carrying bags with dollar signs on them. The cocky criminal, who was declared 'uncontrollable' aged 14, has tried to escape from custody eight times. In September, 1992, he escaped from the St Vincent's Hospital security ward in Melbourne, with the help of a smuggled gun. He was arrested in Sydney and banged up in Parramatta jail, where he then escaped soon after as prison officers fired shots at him. While serving a 71⁄2-year term for armed robberies in 1997, he became the only Victorian prisoner to be shackled in leg irons and handcuffs 23 hours a day. He lost an appeal to have his limbs freed. In 2011 the notorious armed robber and prison escapee tried to sue Victoria over two alleged jailhouse assaults. He claimed the injuries he suffered during assaults in jail were caused by the State of Victoria's negligence. At the age of 14 Christopher Dean Binse was declared uncontrollable and put in Turana boys' home in Melbourne. At 17 he was sent to Pentridge Prison, Victoria, and upon his release started to commit more serious crimes including numerous armed bank robberies. He was given the nickname 'Badness' by a friend in Pentridge in 1988. In September, 1992, he escaped from the St Vincent's Hospital security ward in Melbourne, using a smuggled gun left in the hospital. In the same year, he was arrested in Sydney and escaped soon after from Parramatta jail while prison officers fired shots at him. He was finally re-arrested in December, 1992, by police at a house near Daylesford, Victoria. In 1993, Binse was the leader of a plan to free up to 30 of Victoria's most dangerous prisoners inside Pentridge's then top security H Division. In 1996, he was jailed for 6 1/2 years over the 1992 armed robbery of a Commonwealth Bank, theft of more than $36,000 and escape from Long Bay. In 1997, he lost an appeal against a ruling allowing wardens to put him in leg irons and handcuffs. In 2001, Binse was one of the first inmates of the $20 million high-security jail within the Goulburn Correctional Centre, NSW. In 2005, he was released from the super max jail after serving his full sentence and called for improved rehabilitation programs. While back in jail in Port Phillip Prison in 2011, the notorious armed robber and prison escapee tried to sue Victoria over two alleged jailhouse assaults. He claimed the assaults happened at Barwon Prison in May 2006, and at Marngoneet Prison in July 2007. Soon after his November 2011 release from prison, Binse said he was assaulted 'by four bikies' and spoke about fears for his safety to another man, who was later shot dead. In March 2012 he pleaded guilty to the armed robbery of two guards at the Westside Hotel at Laverton, in Melbourne. On 23 May 2012 'Badness' was arrested after the 44-hour siege at an East Keilor home in Melbourne's north west, where he fired several shots at police. Binse has served 28 of the past 32 years in some form of detention.

"By . Sally Lee . A woman whose genitals were mutilated by a disgraced gynaecologist has broken down outside a Sydney courtroom on Friday after facing the man she says devastated her life. Graeme Stephen Reeves, dubbed the Butcher of Bega, served just 18 months behind bars after he was found guilty for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on patient Carolyn DeWaegeneire. The rogue practitioner, who worked in Bega on the NSW south coast, surgically removed her clitoris and labia without consent during an operation on a pre-cancerous lesion in August 2002. Scroll down for video . Dr Graeme Reeves was released from jail in December after serving just 18 months . He was sentenced to a maximum three-and-a-half years jail in 2011 but was released on parole from Sydney's Long Bay prison in December after he successfully appealed to the High Court. This consequently sparked outrage among Ms DeWaegeneire's supporters and patient advocates. Crown prosecutors want the 64-year-old back behind bars for another year after previous rulings that his original sentence was 'manifestly inadequate'. Reeves and Ms DeWaegeneire, from Wolumla near Bega, sat within metres of each other during an appeal hearing at the NSW Court of Appeal. It was adjourned until June 2 when Chief Justice Thomas Bathurst and justices Peter Hall and Robert Hulme are expected to hand down a decision. Victim and patient Carolyn DeWaegeneire  had her genitals mutilated in August 2002 . 'My life has been totally, totally devastated - totally,' a tearful Ms DeWaegeneire said outside court after the hearing. 'I should be enjoying life as an older person - I'm not.' She described Reeves's original sentence as 'the biggest joke of all time'. 'I've got my medical records. I know damn well what I had before I went in (to hospital). I know damn well what he did.' During his trial, Reeves's lawyers argued the former doctor was saving Ms DeWaegeneire's life and rejected the crown's argument that he did not have consent to remove her genitals. It's understood hundreds of other women have also complained about the former doctor. The Department of Public Prosecutions revealed in November that a significant number of outstanding charges against Reeves, dating more than 20 years, had been dropped. The allegations against Reeves were not pursued because of 'insufficient evidence to ensure a reasonable prospect of conviction', NSW Attorney-General Greg Smith said. Reeves' lawyer, Gabrielle Bashir, on Friday said her client was in poor health and suffering kidney disease and chronic depression, among other conditions, and argued he should not go back to jail. Prosecutors tendered a doctors' report that stated his health conditions could be adequately treated in prison. Reeves made no comment as he left court. Graeme Stephen Reeves first appointed as a visiting medical officer at Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital in 1985, according to NSW Health Department documents . About 35 complaints were made over 20 different incidents about Mr Reeves’s behaviour and clinical practice, starting on June 1986 . Mr Reeves was banned from obstetrics in July 1997 . Psychiatric reports, dating from 1996 to 2004, diagnosed him with a personality disorder and also said he prominent narcissistic features and was at times severely depressed . Reeves continued to practice obstetrics  in hospitals around NSW's south coast region hospitals from April 2002 to January 2003  and gynaecology until the termination of his contract in July 2003 . There were complaints made at the end of 2002 about difficult working relationships between Reeves and staff at Pambula Hospital and by November 14, the hospital did not provide obstetric services . Then in 2003 similar complaints were received about Bega Hospital staff and Reeves, as well as obstetric services he provided to a patient at the hospital in January . He was found guilty by the District Court jury in 2011 for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on patient Carolyn DeWaegeneire after he mutilated her clitoris and labia without her consent during an operation to take out a pre-cancerous lesion in 2002. He was released from jail last December after serving just 18-months of his three-and-a-half year sentence.

Aaron Golub is the long snapper for Newton High School outside of Boston and his skills on the field will be leading him to New Orleans this fall when he heads to college after being awarded a preferred walk on spot for the team. 'If you set your mind to it you can do it. There’s nothing you can’t accomplish if you really want to do it,' he told CBS Boston. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . On the field: Aaron Golub is legally blind but is able to play football in a limited capacity by only doing the long snaps for special plays . Disability: Aaron, 17, was born without being able to see out of his right eye and has limited vision in his left . The 17-year-old has no vision out of his right eye and very limited vision out of his left. He was born with his disability, but that hasn't stopped him from playing the game he loves. CBS Boston reports that Aaron plays as the team long snapper, meaning that he pitches the ball back to the kicker on special plays and punts. The position requires a great amount of precision and speed, both of which he has been able to perfect through hours of training with a specially-made net. Aaron trains in the school gym and on . the football field with the net- which has three pockets at different . heights that gives him a direction to aim for- before school every day . and on the weekends. His coach says that the hard work has paid off. Practice: Aaron trains every day before school and on the weekends and has been a starter on his team for the past two years . Targeted: He hones his skills and precision by working with a specialized net so that he can practice getting the ball into one of three pockets at different heights . Big step: Aaron has since been offered a preferred walk on spot on the Tulane Universary football team . 'He’s only had one bad snap in the last two years he’s snapped for us,' Ted Dalicandro told CBS. 'He’s best long snapper I’ve seen on the high school level.' Fox News reports that when he went to a snapping training camp, he and his father brought goggles with them that showed what it is like to have his vision. '(Aaron) wouldn’t stop until he reached his goal and, most likely, silenced the countless people that told him he wouldn’t be able to do what he wanted because of his ""disability,""' said Chris Rubio, the head of the long snapping camp that Aaron attended in July 2012.","Aaron Golub has been awarded a preferred walk on spot to the Tulane team even though he is legally blind .

Miss Carter's bold outfit, modeled on an ensemble that Rihanna wore in 2010, led to her being cyber-bullied - including several vitriolic tweets from the Grammy-award winner herself. Global superstar Rihanna posted a picture on Twitter last week mocking a 16-year-old Baltimore teenager for copying her outfit to wear to prom . Alexis Clark, 16, wore the skintight catsuit with wings to her prom because she had loved the outfit on her idol Rihanna. The singer later mocked her for the ensemble .

The picture of Miss Carter in her outfit has now spread across social media and led to tirades of abuse against the teenager. And what hurt Miss Carter the most was that Rihanna had joined in the cyberbullying. Miss Carter told Fox Baltimore: 'I was very offended. Why throw shade on it when you had on the exact same thing. The poses was different but the outfit wasn't.' She added: 'She don't love her fans like she says she does.'

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . An Indiana man whose age, white hair and folksy style helped conceal his role as a drug courier was sentenced Wednesday - his 90th birthday - to three years in federal prison for hauling more than a ton of cocaine to Michigan. 'All I can tell you, your honor, is I'm really heartbroken I did what I did,' Leo Sharp told a judge. 'But it's done.' Wearing a dark suit and tie, the frail man stuffed his hands in his pockets as he stood in front of U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds. His attorney occasionally reached over to put a reassuring grip on his shoulder or a supportive stoke on his back. Drug mule: Leo Sharp walks toward U.S. District Court before his scheduled sentencing, Wednesday, May 7 - his 90th birthday . There was no dispute over Sharp's crimes: He admitted last fall that he drove loads of cocaine into Michigan for a Mexican drug organization, one of 19 people charged in the case. The government said he was paid more than $1 million. 'I don't doubt it will be difficult,' Edmunds told Sharp of prison, 'but respect for the law requires there be some custody.' His age aside, Sharp still isn't a typical criminal. He fought Nazis in Italy during World War II and was awarded a Bronze Star for it. The Michigan City, Indiana, man also is known for growing prize-winning daylilies and even contributed 5,000 plant bulbs to his community. Defense lawyer Darryl Goldberg focused on Sharp's past, not the trouble that landed him in court, while asking the judge to keep his client out of prison. 'This is not how we honor our heroes, whether they've fallen from grace or not,' Goldberg said. Jail time: Sharp, a drug courier referred to as the 'old man' by his handlers, and his attorney filed an 18-page sentencing memo, hoping to persuade a judge that home confinement would be appropriate for the Michigan City, Indiana resident . The attorney spent several minutes reading a history of the Battle of Mount Battaglia - 'German blood on the end of their bayonets' - before the judge finally interrupted him. Goldberg repeatedly warned that Sharp's dementia would be a burden for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. He acknowledged Sharp 'went into this eyes wide,' but said his condition led him to use 'bad judgment' and become a drug courier. According to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Detroit, Sharp had been running cocaine and other drugs as early as 2009, when he was just 86. He also hauled duffel bags stuffed with cash back to the southwest border of the United States for the criminal organization that was part of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, prosecutors said. During brief remarks, Sharp said he wished to grow Hawaiian papayas on his property in Florida to pay off his $500,000 penalty to the government. 'So sweet and delicious that people on the mainland will love it,' he said. That won't be possible: The government is seizing and selling the land. Atypical: Sharp, a decorated war veteran who grows prize daylilies, will serve three years in federal prison for his crimes . Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Graveline said criminals don't get a pass simply for military service. He noted that Sharp used his age and appearance as a tool to shake the suspicions of police on cross-country trips before he was finally busted during a traffic stop on Interstate 94, west of Detroit, in 2011, with $3 million worth of cocaine in his pickup. 'They bargained on him not getting caught,' the judge said in agreement. Edmunds said linking dementia to Sharp's crimes was an 'insult to all the people who have dementia and don't get involved in illegal activity.' Despite going to prison, Sharp still got a significant break. The government was seeking a five-year sentence, and sentencing guidelines called for a minimum of 14 years. According to the Detroit Free Press, Sharp turned to prosecutors and called his prison term a 'death sentence' and indicated he wouldn't live long in jail. 'I won’t live in prison, I’m just going to end my life if I end up there.'","Leo Sharp, 90, has been sentenced to three years prison .

At the time they thought little of the noise, and decided to browse the Eduardo Alessandro Studios art gallery. But after returning to their vehicle 15 minutes later they were shocked to see a large crowd gathered and grew concerned for Fern's welfare. Mr Haddow, 58, said: 'I came out of the gallery and looked down the street and saw a crowd of people standing around, pointing at my car.' 'I started running because I was worried something had happened to her,' he added. 'When I got closer I realised people were pointing and laughing and taking pictures. She gave me a sideways glance and just kept on going,' Mr Haddow went on. Mr Haddow, who worked for children's charity Bernardo's before taking early retirement, said a young man on a scooter told him he had been watching Fern blast the car horn for around 15 minutes while he and his wife were looking at works of art in a nearby shop.

"By . Ashley Collman . Self-diagnosis: 44-year-old author Alethea Black thought she was suffering from an autoimmune disorder before she realized the mercury in her silver filling were poisoning her . A 44-year-old New York woman went years fearing she was suffering from an autoimmune disorder before she discovered it was the mercury in her silver fillings that was making her sick. Doctors were at a loss when Alethea Black first started noticing a tickling in her leg and numbness in her left pinky in 2010 - and the symptoms only got worse over the next two years. After reading an article on the dangers of silver fillings, the Dutchess County native had the cavity fillers removed and has been symptom-free ever since. Black first noticed something was wrong while taking her dog for a walk in October 2010. She describes what felt like a spider crawling up her leg, but looked down and saw nothing. 'I would look under my jeans and there would be no spider,' she told Cosmopolitan magazine. 'Then I would feel it again.' She also noticed that her left pinky went numb, but she initially ignored the sensations. Things got worse the following spring when the entire left side of her face went numb. Black rushed to the Emergency Room, fearing that she was suffering a stroke, but doctors said she was fine and the numbness went away a few days later. Without a diagnosis, the symptoms kept piling on. She developed gastritis, ringing in the ears, insomnia, a permanent red rash on her left leg, as well as more spider-crawling and numbness. This was also around the time that Black was working on publishing a book, so many attributed her health issues to stress. Mercury constitutes 50 per cent of silver fillings and can degrade and cause heavy metal poisoning over time - though they are still considered save by the American Dental Association . But when the left side of her face went numb for a second time, she returned to the ER where doctors yet again told her she was fine. They ran blood tests and ruled out a stroke since she was able to move her face. Concerned Black took up looking for a diagnosis herself, exhausting medical resources on the internet to search for an answer. 'The more I looked into it, the more I thought this was lupus, or the beginnings of M.S., or even ALS. I went through weeks of really believing this was the case,' she says. When she noticed that her rash would get worse while sitting next to a space heater, Black looked up whether autoimmune diseases flare up when exposed to electromagnetic radiation and found her answer. Black came across an article that explained the dangers of silver fillings, which are made up of 50 per cent mercury - a toxin that is then released into the body. All better now: All of Black's concerning symptoms went away once she had her 30 year old silver fillings removed . Over time, the mercury can degrade and cause heavy metal poisoning. Black's fillings were 30 years old. Black never got that diagnosis from a doctor since silver fillings are regarded as safe by the American Dental Association, though many dentists have been outspoken about their dangers. She realized that her space heater's electromagnetic field could be triggering the mercury in her fillings and immediately sought out a dentist to have them removed. Not many dentists perform the complicated process, so Black struggled at first but eventually found Dr Jeffrey Viglielmo in Kingston, New York. Black was tested for mercury poisoning and discovered that she had three times the normal amount in her system, in addition to being one of 10 per cent allergic to the element. Before the procedure, Black had to drink activated charcoal and then wear a protective barrier to stop the mercury going down her throat since it becomes 20 times more potent when extracted. After having the fillings removed, Black noticed an immediate difference. The rash went away, her skin and hair went back to normal and she no longer noticed the spider-crawling or numbness. 'It’s shocking how few people are aware [of the danger of silver fillings], how easy it is to remedy, and how dramatic the effects of removal were,' Black says. 'One thing that lingers so strongly, is how much an active advocate you need to be on behalf of your own health.'","Writer Alethea Black, 44, thought she was suffering from an autoimmune disorder for two years .

A registered sex offender and convicted criminal is back behind bars after his girlfriend - terrified for her safety and for her baby - slipped a convenience store clerk a note on Saturday afternoon begging him for help. Mark Valuckas, 36, of Tacoma, Washington, has an extensive criminal record which includes sexual assault, kidnapping, and weapons and drugs charges. His girlfriend, who hasn’t been named, told police that Valuckas had a history of being abusive to her and had even threatened to hurt her child. Scroll down for video . Registered sex offender and convicted criminal Mark Valuckas, 36, of Tacoma, Washington, is back behind bars after his girlfriend slipped a convenience store clerk a note on Saturday afternoon begging for help . She claims that Valuckas - who is 4 feet, 3 inches tall - hit her on the side of her head with a baseball bat during an argument on Saturday then held a pocket knife to her throat and threatened to kill her. Valuckas then allegedly told her to take a ride with him so he could calm down, reports The News Tribune. The woman was so frightened for her safety that when he told her to go inside and pay at an ARCO gas station in Tacoma, Washington, she saw her chance to get help. Bruce Dean, who was working at the store, told KIRO that he was approached by the frightened woman who begged him for a pen and paper and then handed him a note. The woman was so frightened for her safety that when she went pay at this ARCO gas station in Tacoma, Washington, she begged the staff to call 911 . The note . read, ‘Can you call 911,’ then she listed her license plate number. The . next line said ‘DV’ for domestic violence, and finally: ‘Baby in car.’ As the woman headed back to the car, Dean called 911 and gave them the license plate number. Shortly . afterwards a Pierce County sheriff's deputy caught up with the vehicle . and found that Valuckas had a baseball bat and a knife with him. According to court records, the woman also told police that Valuckas had allegedly stabbed her left hand, burned her . with a cigarette and repeatedly punched her, during an incident last Thursday. Prosecutors . have charged Valuckas with two counts of second-degree assault and . felony harassment. Gas station clerk Bruce Dean, right, recognized Valuckas, left, several days after the incident because the convicted criminal is shorter than five foot and therefore has a distinctive appearance . Superior Court Judge Phil Sorensen ordered Valuckas . jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail. The baby was unharmed in the incident. Dean spoke to KIRO on Tuesday and was able to confirm that Valuckas, who is distinctive because of his short height, was the man involved in Saturday’s incident. When Dean was told about the events that had resulted in the woman begging him for help he said he was glad to have helped. Valuckas, who has been known to use aliases including Mark Valucus and Markiss Valuckas, appears on the sex offender registry following a kidnapping conviction in 2005. He has served two spells in the Washington County Prison system between 2005 and 2006, and then between 2010 and 2013.

"By . Damien Gayle . This is the moment that Cai Juanjuan thought would never happen - the chance to hold her missing daughter in her arms again more than two decades after she went missing. Cai Ruru was only four years old when she was snatched from her grandmother's home in the city of Ruian in Zhejian province, east China. Mrs Cai feared she would never see her . daughter again. But thanks to a nationwide DNA database set up to try . to trace the background of lost children, the pair have been reunited. Poignant: The moment Cai Ruru is reunited with her mother Cai Juanjuan, two decades after she was snatched from her grandmother's home and taken hundreds of miles away to be sold into adoption . Moving: Mrs Cai had feared that she would never see her daughter again, but they have been reunited thanks to a nationwide DNA database set up five years ago to trace lost children in China . Ruru embraces her mother: She was one of the tens of thousands of children kidnapped every year in China . It comes after 25 years of heartache. On the day Ruru was taken, Mrs Cai and her husband, Li Mianquan, had left her with her grandmother while they went out to work. 'My mother-in-law knew that our daughter was well-behaved, so she hadn't bothered to lock the door when she went shopping,' said Mrs Cai. 'When she came back 30 minutes later the house was empty and daughter had vanished.' Despite scouring the area for weeks and filing reports with the authorities they were unable to find Ruru. Ruru in an old photo: Kidnappers struck while Ruru was at her grandmother's house, where her mother and father had left her while they were at work . The grandmother died broken-hearted four years ago, but Mrs Cai and her husband refused to give up hope. They were some of the first to leave samples with DNA database when it was set up in 2009, but for years they heard nothing. China suffers from an epidemic of . child kidnapping, with tens of thousands abducted every year for sale . into adoption, forced labour and prostitution. But Ruru had been lucky. Rather than face the sad fate of many of China's snatched children she had ended up with a good family in Putian, a city in Fujian province, who believed they were adopting an abandoned child. Ruru's adoptive parents had paid money . for her, but they believed the cash was to grease the wheels of China's . notorious bureaucracy and speed up the adoption process. They . gave the girl the surname Wong, and when she was eight her parents told . her that she was adopted. This year she finally decided to search for . her real parents and she, too, gave a sample to the database. Ruru, . now 29, said: 'My adoptive parents had two sons but no daughter, so . they had arranged to adopt me. I was the oldest child in the family. 'I . have to say they treated me very well, I don't have any complaints, but . I wanted to find out who my real parents were. I wanted to tell them I . was okay and didn't want them to have any regrets.' Mrs Cai and her daughter as a toddler: The grandmother died broken-hearted four years ago, but Mrs Cai and her husband were some of the first to leave samples with DNA database when it was set up in 2009 . 'I was determined not to cry, but when I saw the beautiful young woman my daughter has become I couldn't help it,' said Mrs Cai after she was reunited with Ruru at Bao'an Airport in the city of Shenzhen . Estimates of the number of kidnapped children in China range from 10,000 per year to as high as 70,000. Most parents who lose children stand very little chance of getting them back. Mrs Cai believed that she was also destined to never see her daughter again. But then she got the call from police to say that they had a match for her DNA - her daughter had been found. She said: 'I couldn't believe it, I was almost too scared to believe it. But then I bought a ticket straight away and flew to meet her.' And as a result the child, now a young woman with a husband and child of her own, met her real mother at Bao'an Airport in the city of Shenzhen. Her mother said: 'I was determined not to cry, but when I saw the beautiful young woman my daughter has become I couldn't help it.'","Tens of thousands of children are kidnapped for sale every year in China .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Scientists have programmed a computer to read people’s dreams. They claim their invention, the ‘dream catcher’ is 60 per cent accurate. The level of detail is still far from that in the Leonardo DiCaprio film Inception, in which people manipulate people’s dreams and steal their sleeping thoughts. Scientists have programmed a computer to read people's dreams, and it is 60 per cent accurate. The level of detail is still far from that in the Leonardo DiCaprio film Inception, in which people manipulate people¿s dreams and steal their sleeping thoughts . However, experts have described the work, detailed in the respected journal Science, as ‘stunning’. They added that just a few years ago such a feat would have been firmly in the realms of Star Trek, at best. The Japanese scientists began by scanning the brains of three volunteers as they slept in an MRI machine. Every six or seven minutes, they were prodded awake and asked to describe any dream they’d been having. The study has been described as 'stunning in its detail and success' The process was repeated until each participant had recounted at least 200 dreams. One drowsy man told the researchers: ‘From the sky, I saw something like a bronze statue, a big bronze statue. ‘The bronze statue existed on a small hill.  Below the hill, there were houses, streets and trees.’ Another volunteer said: ‘I hid a key in a place between a chair and a bed and someone took it.’ The descriptions were analysed and the key themes for each participant placed into twenty categories. Examples of categories include men, women, tools, books and cars. Next, the volunteers, who were by now wide awake, were shown photos corresponding to things from the categories and their brains scanned once more. A computer programme quickly learnt to pick out the brain activity ‘signatures’ for each category. In the final part of the experiment, the computer put its knowledge to use, by trying to decode the brain scans of the volunteers as they slept once more. Amazingly, the computer identified the sort of images being dreamt about 60 per cent of the time. This is far higher than would occur due to chance alone, says researcher Yukiyasu Kamitani, of ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto. Some neuroscientists said that the volunteers were sleeping so lightly during the study that they weren’t technically dreaming. According to American imaging experts, convicts showing low activity in an area of the brain associated with decision-making and action are more likely to be arrested again. A  group of 96 male prisoners underwent MRI scans shortly before they were due to be released, while they were carrying out computer tasks in which subjects had to make quick decisions and inhibit impulsive reactions.The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to focus on activity in a section of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) -  a small region in the front of the brain involved in motor control and executive functioning. They then followed the subjects for four years. Among the ex-criminals studied, those who had lower ACC activity during the quick-decision tasks were more likely to be arrested again after getting out of prison. But the researchers believe that the dreaming of deep sleep may be very similar. US neuroscientist and dream expert Dr Robert Stickgold, from Harvard Medical School in Boston, said we are still far from having a machine that can fully read our dreams. But, despite this, he described the study as ‘stunning in its detail and success’. He told Science: ‘This is probably the first real demonstration of the brain basis of dream content.’ Dr Stickgold said the research proved, for the first time, that when people describe their dreams they are at least close to being accurate. ‘Up until this moment, there were no grounds on which to say we don't just make up our dreams when we wake up.’ He added that in future, the technique could be used to help us remember forgotten dreams. Similar technology has been used in rudimentary mind-reading of people when they are awake.","The ‘dream catcher’ is 60 per cent accurate, tests have revealed .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin isn't to blame for the GOP's loss in the 2008 presidential election, Meghan McCain, daughter of 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, says. McCain told talk show host Larry King in an interview for his PoltiKING show that not even the Son of God could have saved her dad's campaign. 'I think my father could have had Jesus Christ as his running mate and it wouldn't have mattered in '07. I truly believe that,' she said. 'I think my father could have had Jesus Christ as his running mate and it wouldn't have mattered in '07. I truly believe that,' Meghan McCain now says of her dad's failed bid for the presidency five and a half years ago . McCain wrote in her 2010 book Dirty Sexy Politics that Palin added 'drama, stress, complications, panic and loads of uncertainty' to her father's presidential campaign' and that after it was all said and done ' she wondered 'if it was Sarah Palin's fault' that her dad, Arizona Senator John McCain, lost the general election to now-President Barack Obama. In an interview about her book in August of 2010, McCain argued that 'I do clearly state at the end that we did not lose because of her, and . I'm speaking out now because I do have conflicting feelings about her.' 'She brought so much momentum . and enthusiasm to the campaign,' McCain told Good Morning America host George Stephanopolous. Now, five and a half years later, McCain seems to have gained perspective on her dad's failed bid for the presidency. Not only does she now claim Palin is not at fault for her father's defeat, she claims Palin was treated unfairly by the media. 'I wish the media had been easier on her during that time, or at least more understanding,' McCain told King in an interview that will air later tonight. McCain agreed with King that Palin did 'bring a lot on herself' but said 'she was also not given a great hand and people really wanted to rip her apart.' 'Again you just be a strong woman in the media - it doesn't matter what party - and the media's going to annihilate you,' the 29-year-old said. Republican presidential nominee John McCain, center, waves to crowed during a rally with Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, right, his wife Cindy McCain, left, and daughter Meghan McCain, second left, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on October 8, 2008 . McCain's distaste for Republican strategist Karl Rove, on the other hand, still knows no bounds nor does her hatred for the Secret Service. As the daughter of a presidential nominee, McCain had Secret Service protection for a few months in 2008. McCain said her time with the agents left a bad taste in her mouth, and she wasn't surprised when they started getting into trouble with prostitutes. 'I respect that they're there to protect people, but I found them very cliquey and very gossipy and very voyeuristic. I did not like the secret service,' she said. McCain's beef with Rove goes back more than a decade to the 2000 presidential election, during which her father was also a candidate. Her family still believes Rove spread a rumor during that election that her adopted sister from Bangladesh was an illegitimate child of her father. 'I hate Karl Rove and I think he still needs to apologize to my family, which he has not done, for the things that happened in 2000,' McCain told King, 'and I think there was an era where Karl Rove was relevant and I don’t know why people still give him attention.' She pointed to Election Day 2012 as evidence that people should stop taking the former Bush adviser seriously. On that day, Rove refused to believe that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had lost the election, long after it had become clear that Barack Obama had won. McCain said she also thinks his comment's on Hillary Clinton's health are in poor taste. Of course Clinton's health should be an issue of discussion should she run in 2016, McCain said, calling it 'a very interesting conversation to have. But she said the way Rove went about it was 'disgusting.'","Meghan McCain, the daughter of Arizona Senator John McCain, told Larry King that Alaska Governor Sarah Palin isn't the reason her father lost the 2008 presidential election to Barack Obama .

"By . Katy Winter . Over 21 per cent of participants in the Heidelberg research used their lucid dream to practice a skill such as a sport . It seems like the ultimate lazy girl's fantasy - or the plot of a science fiction movie. But new research has revealed sporting performance can be improved while we sleep. It comes down to lucid dreaming - essentially the sort of dream you have while fast asleep but in which you aware you are dreaming and can thus control your dream world. Studies have for some time noted a link between lucid dreaming during REM sleep and improved athletic performance, but had never isolated the reason why. Now research by Heidelberg University and published in the Guardian's running blog shows that the improvement stems from the fact that your mind believes you are practising the sport for real. Sportsmen and women who have engaged in training while they sleep have described enhanced performance after practising such things as a complex move, a tricky shot in basketball or a free kick in football over and over again. Others have controlled their dreams to make themselves run faster, or for longer without tiring, or simply told themselves they can move past feelings of exhaustion to carry on running. One ballerina in the study describes struggling with a complicated move for some time before 'sleep practising' it - and found she could then perform it in real life too. Though scientists are not yet certain of what brain activity is behind lucid dreaming, research by Muzur, Pace-Schott and Hobson has suggested that activation of the  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, usually  deactivated during REM (Rapid Eye Moment sleep) may be responsible for us regaining self-awareness while still asleep. The amygdala and parahippocampal cortex is less intensely activated than normal to allow us to maintain self-awareness and yet remain asleep. Previous research has proved that lucid dreamers are indeed asleep, but are aware that they are in a dream. Dreamers have been able to signal to researchers from within their dream using pre-agreed eye movements. In the 1980s German psychologist Paul Tholey was the first to note the link between lucid dreaming and improved performance, and in 2010 psychologists Erlacher and Schredl showed that practising a coin tossing task in lucid dreams led to an improved objective performance. It all sounds too good to be true. But becoming an accomplished lucid dreamer is not necessarily easy. If you do not naturally lucid dream it is possible to train yourself to do so. The first step is to be able to recognise that you are in a dream once asleep, which some people attempt to do by performing ‘reality checks’ in a dream. However it takes considerable training to be able to perform these within a dream. Once aware you are dreaming, the dreamer . must be cautious to let the dream continue but be conscious enough to . remember that it is a dream. Most people can train themselves to lucid dream, and the possible uses for being aware and in control of your dream world are endless . However the benefits once mastered are said to be incredible with people not only being able to change nightmares into positive dreams and problem solve while asleep, but also report having immense fun. Being able to control the dream world means people report enjoying anything from flying to making a cake as large as a house, indulging in sexual fantasies and curing nightmares. Note down your target dream. What do you want to dream about? Who will you be and what will you be doing? What is your goal in the dream? Meditate on the narrative before you go to sleep. Imagine the scenes you will appear in and what you will do. Draw pictures, use visualisation. Focus on the detail - don't be too general. Make your fantasy specific. Avoid television or books before bed or those stories and images may take over your own narrative. Recognise that you are in a dream once asleep. Some people attempt . this by performing ‘reality checks’ in a dream. Ask yourself regularly during the day - 'am I dreaming? Am I awake?'. Once habitual, this thought process can be carried over into your dream world, . Once aware you are dreaming, be cautious to let the dream continue but be conscious enough to . remember that it is a dream. Think about your dreams when you wake up - this will help you remember them and allow them to have more effect.

New York beaches have won twice, while California and North Carolina have produced one top beach apiece. This already has been a big spring for Duke Kahanamoku Beach. In the new blockbuster movie 'Godzilla,' it's where the monster clambers out of the Pacific and into Waikiki, flooding the streets and demolishing hotels. Leatherman, who did his Ph.D. on beach erosion, said such a kaiju attack would hurt the beach in his rankings if the debris wasn't cleaned up.

"By . Ruth Styles . Two brave - or should that be foolhardy - male presenters volunteered to experience labour pains for a skit on their TV show - and found it harder to stomach than they realised. Dutch presenting duo Dennis Storm and Valerio Zena were hooked up to electrodes that replicated the contractions women are forced to undergo - but the men only lasted two hours before they begged for the electrodes to be taken off. The faux labour was filmed and screened during an episode of the pair's hit TV show, Proefkonijnen (Guinea Pigs). Brave or foolish? Presenters Dennis Storm, left, and Valerio Zena, right, signed up to experience simulated childbirth for their television show, Guinea Pigs . But the labour challenge proved too much for the hosts, who writhed in agony as the electrodes kicked in. Speaking ahead of the simulated labour, Storm and Zena revealed they wanted to experience the pain of childbirth because they'd heard that 'giving birth is the worst pain there is'. Strapped up to the electrodes and with the stunt seconds from starting, Zena asks of a nurse: 'Do you think the pain will make us scream?'. Bluntly, she replies: 'Yes, it definitely will.' Taking . the plunge: The men had electrodes attached to their muscles that would . as closely as possible replicated the sensations of childbirth . Coping: The men experienced soaring levels of pain and turned to gas and air to combat the agony . And the nurse's prediction proved entirely accurate as the pair are left doubled up in pain within moments of the fake contractions kicking in. Although they make a brave attempt to laugh and joke their way through the experience, the misery on their faces gives the game away. So bad is the pain, Zena is left questioning whether he even wants children as his wife would be forced to go through an experience he describes as 'torture'. Torture or not, Zena and Storm aren't the first men to volunteer for fake childbirth. Comfort: Dennis grips his partner's hand to help bear the pain - while his pal Valerio questions whether he could ever now have children and put his wife though this pain . Keep moving: Dennis emulates a mobile birth by kneeling to try to relieve the pain . Cranking it up: The nurse in charge of the experiment turned the electricity coming through the machine up higher and higher until the men were writhing on the bed in agony . In 2009, Dr Andrew Rochford went through a similar experience for Australian TV show, What's Good for You. Two hours later, Rochford was turning the air blue as he struggled to deal with the pain, adding afterwards that he could now 'understand why women swear'. Storm and Zena are no strangers to . painful stunts. In 2011, the pair cooked and ate each others' flesh, . which was shown on live TV. Worth it?

Get the calculator out over dinner to work out if you've hit 2,000 yet? Don't fret. You're probably not alone. The average woman spends almost one entire year of her life obsessing about calories and fretting about her weight, according to new research. Women spend almost a year of their lives counting calories and worrying about their weight during lifetime... but men aren't far behind . Women typically think about or talk about their diets for around 21 minutes per day, or over two hours every single week. That means they fret about their size for 127 hours a year, which over 67 years of an average adult lifetime equates to around 355 days. Almost one year . By contrast men spend 18 minutes a day or 109 hours a year thinking about calories, which equates to 304 days of their lives - fewer, but not that far behind. What's more, half of us claim to be unhappy with our weight, and manage what we eat by monitoring  calories. The average adult spends 338 days of their life calorie-counting - that equates to 20 minutes a day, over two hours a week and an average of 121 hours per year checking labels for calorie content, talking about calories or thinking about calories.

"By . David Mccormack . A former CNN employee who enjoyed wearing brightly colored clothes to work and also mariachi uniforms has launched a $60 million discrimination lawsuit after he fired last June. William Kane claims that he was let go from the news station's New York operation after his sexuality became common knowledge. According to his lawsuit, Kane's claims that although he had always dressed in a colorful manner it only became a problem once bosses heard about his same-sex engagement. William Kane, pictured alongside Christine Amanpour, claims he had always worn bright colors to work and that it only became an issue after he revealed his same-sex engagement and so his boss learned of his sexuality . Kane worked at CNN for over 10 years and claims for the majority of that time no one ever complained about his wardrobe which included a hot pink shirt, bright red track jacket, neon green soccer jersey and a yellow track suit with matching shoes and hat. The lawsuit states that after Kane's supervisor John Silva learned that he was gay, his workplace environment became hostile, reports the New York Daily News. He alleges that Silva told him he didn't want him to wear either his black or yellow mariachi suits 'because it was too flamboyant for a male in our department.' Silva runs the technical operations department and suggested to Kane that he might be better suited in the 'entertainment or make-up department.' In his lawsuit, Kane claims he was told that presenters including Erin Burnett, center, and Pier Morgan, right, had complained about his clothes, but when he was spoke to them they denied having a problem . Kane claims he was singled out, despite the fact that the department had had a tradition of wearing colorful shirts on Thursdays between 2002 and 2008. During Kane's CNN career he worked alongside presenters including Christine Amanpour, Piers Morgan and Erin Burnett. In his lawsuit he claims that a supervisor offered him $100 to buy something from TJ Maxx after former presenter Piers Morgan had complained that Kane's blue track suit was too distracting. Kane refused the money and put a black CNN sweatshirt over the track suit. When he later confronted Morgan about the issue, the British journalist denied that it had been an issue. Another time Kane claims he was ordered to change out of a white suit and red tie because Erin Burnett considered it 'too flashy'. She denied to his face making any such comment. Kane said he complained to the human resources department about his treatment, but then he was cited for nitpicking violations.","William Kane claims he had always worn bright colors to work, but it only became an issue after he revealed his same-sex engagement .

"By . Darren Boyle . The Ministry of Defence is looking to cash in on this 19th Century French chateau-style mansion by putting it on the market for £5 million. Minley Manor is a stunning-looking Grade II listed property with historic parks and gardens. It was built in the 1850s by British architect Henry Clutton for Raikes Currie, a wealthy London Banker and MP. Minley Manor is being sold by the Ministry of Defence for an estimated £5 million. The French chateau style mansion was built by a wealthy MP during the 1850s . The stunning property features its own 600 metre long wooded avenue as well as an Orangery . It took 14 years to complete the construction of the magnificent mansion . Raikes Currie was born in 1801 into a wealthy family. Educated at Eton, he became a partner in his father's bank in 1826. Following his father's death in 1843, he took over control of the bank . Although between 1837 and 1857 he was a Liberal MP for Northhampton. In 1846, he bought Minley Manor near Farborough and employed Henry Clutton to design it. The house was completed in 1860, nine years before the death of his wife Laura. Raikes Currie died at home in Minley Manor in October 1881. He then commissioned Robert Veitch to lay out the gardens of the mansion, which is regarded as one of Surrey’s most remarkable properties. Further extensions including the Stable Block and Orangery were made by the architect George Devey between 1884 and 1886. There is also a beautiful, 600-metre long avenue of Wellingtonia trees which sit to the north of the manor home. The complete estate, which then stood at around 2,500 acres, was later sold to the War Department in 1934. In 1971, it was taken over by the Royal Engineers who are now based at Gibraltar Barracks on the other side of the A327 Minley Road. Minley Manor, with its outbuildings, boasts a total of more than 88,000 sq/ft of potential accommodation - the equivalent of 90 new homes. It was last used in August 2013 and has featured in a number of films, most recently the 2007 fantasy Stardust with Robert de Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer. The manor is now being sold by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation as part of the government’s estate ‘rationalisation programme’. It has been put on the market with Carter Jonas with an asking price of in excess of £5 million. Emma Jewson, associate partner at Carter Jonas, said: 'It is a unique building. The external design is very special and as it has been owned by the government it has been well maintained.' The stunning mansion is set on 2,500 acres of land and features an Orangery as well as dozens of outbuildings and walled gardens .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . House Democrats have decided to play ball and participate in a special committee charged with investigating the Obama administration's handling of a 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya that left four Americans dead and forced the withdrawal of U.S. diplomats from the eastern port city. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi named five Democrats to the panel: Elijah Cummings of Maryland, Adam Smith of Washington, Adam Schiff of California, Linda Sánchez  of California and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois. Some in the Democratic caucus had floated the idea of boycotting the committee and leaving Republicans to pursue the Benghazi investigation, opening the opportunity to paint the investigation as a partisan political stunt in an election year. Play ball!: House Minority leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi appointed five Democrats to serve on a GOP-led Select Committee charged with investigating the 2012 Benghazi terror attack . The military-style incursion directed by Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah against U.S. diplomatic facilities left the U.S. Ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead . They initially demanded equal representation on the committee, but the Republican majority stuck with tradition and divided the seats 7 to 5. Two weeks ago another scenario emerged that would have seen a single Democrat participating so that liberals could keep tabs on its activities without appearing to approve of its mission. The special Select Committee will gather more than a half-dozen separate committees' investigations into the Benghazi attack under one roof, taking over principally from the Oversight and Ways & Means committees. Cummings, the senior Democrat on the panel, is also the ranking minority member of the Oversight committee. He has crossed swords with Republican chairman Darrell Issa, a California firebrand, over the significance of documents, the breadth of subpoenas, and the notable saga of former IRS official Lois Lerner, whose Contempt of Congress vote a group of Issa-led Republicans pushed to the House floor, where it succeeded. In addition to having broad subpoena powers and license to grill hearing witnesses that would usually fall under a range of committees' separate jurisdictions, members of the new committee will be allowed to interrogate them at length instead of sticking to a traditional five-minute limit per questioner. House . Speaker John Boehner has tapped South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy to chair . the committee. He will be joined by fellow Republicans Susan Brooks of . Indiana, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mike Pompeo of Kansas, Martha Roby of . Alabama, Peter Roskam of Illinois and Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia. Mr. Chairman: South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former prosecutor, will chair the Select Committee . The outspoken and sometimes cantankerous Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings will counter Gowdy as the ranking member of the House minority on the panel . They are charged with finding out what the U.S. State Department and Pentagon could have done to save lives – yet didn't – and what the White House may have done to cover up an incompetent security system that denied the Benghazi compound extra muscle when al-Qaeda-affiliated militants began threatening to attack. No one has been arrested or charged with a crime in connection with the September 11, 2012 military incursion at an American diplomatic outpost and a nearby CIA annex, carried out by Ansar al-Shariah, an al-Qaeda affiliate. During a weekend fundraiser, President Barack Obama called Republicans' focus on Benghazi and his Obamacare insurance overhaul law 'not serious.' He previously referred to Benghazi and other crises in his administration as 'phony scandals.' The outcome of the Select Committee's work could impact the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State during the attack, is likely to run for president. Her conduct before and after the 2012 calamity is in question. Initially, she and Obama both shied away from conceding that Islamist terrorists had attacked Americans in Benghazi, instead blaming the massacre on a spontaneous protest in reaction to a crude U.S.-made YouTube video that lampooned the Muslim prophet Muhammad. The intelligence community, it later emerged, never reported that conclusion on the ground. And the White House knew almost instantly who was lobbing fixed mortars and grenades into the compound.","House Democrats will have five seats on the new Select Committee, to the Republicans' seven .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Yoo Byung-eun, 73, has caused a media frenzy in South Korea since disappearing with his son . South Korea is offering a $50,000 reward for information about a mysterious missing billionaire who authorities say owns a ferry that sank last month, leaving more than 300 people dead or missing. The disappearance of Yoo Byung-eun, 73, and his son has caused a media frenzy in South Korea. Yoo, dubbed the 'millionaire with no face' was thought to be holed up in a sprawling church compound near Seoul, and there was a tense, standoff between police and hundreds of church followers, some of whom reportedly threatened to die as martyrs. Yoo is a member of a church that critics call a cult and have linked to a 1987 mass suicide; church members deny involvement. But Yoo wasn't there when church members on Wednesday finally opened the compound to authorities, and some speculated that he may have fled to the home of a church follower. Prosecutors and police then announced a 50 million won ($50,000) reward for information about Yoo's location, and 30 million won ($30,000) for details about his eldest son. Yoo, head of the now-defunct predecessor of the ferry's current operator, Chonghaejin, allegedly still controls the company through a complex web of holding companies in which his children and close associates are large shareholders. South Korea is offering a big bounty to find the mysterious billionaire thought to be the owner a ferry that sank last month, leaving more than 300 people dead or missing . Rescue operations underway in April after the ferry Sewol sank in waters off Jindo Island, in the southwestern province of South Jeolla . Senior prosecutor Kim Hoe-jong said authorities believe Yoo is the chairman of Chonghaejin. Yoo faces allegations of tax evasion, embezzlement and professional negligence. Prosecutors have said they suspect that the April 16 ferry sinking may have happened because Chonghaejin illicitly funneled profits to Yoo's family, and so failed to spend enough money on safety and personnel. His son, Yoo Dae-gyun, faces embezzlement allegations. Chonghaejin's official leader, CEO Kim Han-sik, and four other employees have already been arrested. Officials suspect improper stowage and overloading of cargo may have contributed to the disaster. Officers at the National Police Agency said Friday that they have begun a massive manhunt to capture Yoo. A special team of about 150 veteran detectives and police officers has been established. Tens of thousands of posters with photos of Yoo and his son and information about the rewards have been plastered on bus terminals, train stations and other public places, agency officials said. Officers who capture Yoo or his son will be promoted by one rank. Relatives holding portraits of their children who perished when the Sewol ferry sank with the loss of around 300 lives stage a sit-in protest demanding to see South Korean President Park Geun-Hye in Seoul . A protestor puts up yellow origami boats on the side of a police vehicle while relatives with children who perished when the Sewol ferry sank . Yoo is said to be the leader of the Evangelical Baptist Church, sometimes known as the Salvation Sect, and critics allege that church members call him ""Moses."" Church members deny that and say Yoo is just an ordinary member, although they acknowledge he has some influence because of his long affiliation with the church, which was founded by his father-in-law. The church was in the news in 1987 when 32 people, then reportedly affiliated with a splinter group of the Salvation Sect, were found dead in the attic of a factory near Seoul in what authorities said was a collective murder-suicide pact. The deaths occurred as police investigated whether the splinter group's leader swindled money from more than 200 people. Yoo later faced an investigation over the deaths. A probe into the dead people's financial transactions showed some of their money was funneled to him. South Korean Roman Catholics nuns hold a candle light mass for victims of the sunken ferry in front of the Seoul City Hall . Monks attend a ceremony at the Jogye Temple in Seoul, South Korea, this week in memory of the victims of the 16 April sinking of the ferry . He was cleared of suspicions that he was behind the suicides because of a lack of evidence, but he was convicted on a separate fraud charge that he collected donations from church members and invested them in his businesses. Yoo founded Chonghaejin's predecessor, Semo Corp., in 1979. The conglomerate, which found success with businesses running cruises on Seoul's Han River, had firms involved in cosmetics, real estate, other domestic ferry businesses and shipbuilding. It once had nearly 3,000 employees. Semo went bankrupt amid the Asian foreign exchange crisis in the late 1990s. Even after Semo's bankruptcy, Yoo's family continued to operate ferry businesses under the names of other companies, including one that eventually became Chonghaejin. The ferry businesses owned by Yoo's family suffered a slew of maritime accidents. In 1991, 14 Semo workers were killed when their cruise ship on the Han River was hit by another ship. In recent years, Yoo has worked as a photographer under the name of ""Ahae,"" and his works have been shown at the Louvre and the Palace of Versailles. Companies affiliated with Chonghaejin reportedly have spent tens of millions of dollars to buy his photographs.

"By . Emma Innes . Many dieters opt for sugar-free drinks in a bid to shed some excess pounds, but new research suggests this tactic is not effective. U.S. researchers found that overweight and obese adults who drink diet fizzy drinks consume more calories from food than those who drink regular fizzy drinks. The researchers, at the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, examined national patterns in adult drink consumption and calorie intake. Overweight people who drink diet fizzy drinks eat more meaning they do not consume fewer calories overall . They discovered that those who opt for diet drinks do not end up consuming fewer calories overall. ‘Although overweight and obese adults who drink diet soda eat a comparable amount of total calories as heavier adults who drink sugary beverages, they consume significantly more calories from solid food at both meals and snacks,’ said Dr Sara Bleich, associate professor with the Bloomberg School’s Department of Health Policy and Management and lead author of the paper. Artificial sweeteners, which are present . in large quantities in diet soda, are associated with a greater . activation of reward centres in the brain. In other words, among people who . drink diet soda, the brain’s sweet sensors may no longer provide a . reliable gauge of energy consumption because the artificial sweetener . disrupts appetite control. As a result, consumption of diet drinks may result in increased food intake overall. Using data from the 1999 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), researchers looked at national patterns of drink consumption and caloric intake. Consumption of diet drinks has increased considerably in the past few decades from three per cent in 1965 to 20 per cent today. Individuals who drink diet soda typically have a higher BMI (Body Mass Index) and consume more snack food than those who drink sugary beverages. Earlier research may explain why the investigators found higher consumption of food among heavy adults who drink diet beverages.

As a result, consumption of diet drinks may result in increased food intake overall. ‘The results of our study suggest that overweight and obese adults looking to lose or maintain their weight - who have already made the switch from sugary to diet beverages - may need to look carefully at other components of their solid-food diet, particularly sweet snacks, to potentially identify areas for modification,’ said Dr Bleich.","People who opt for diet drinks do not consume fewer calories overall .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Ukip today claimed it had failed to breakthrough in London despite its success in the rest of the country - because voters in the capital are more 'media savvy and educated' than elsewhere. Nigel Farage's party picked up more than 100 seats from Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems in council elections nationally and is expected to top the European vote on Sunday. But Mr Farage's campaign flopped in the capital, where Labour picked up key swing councils from the Tories. Ukip failed to do as well in London as it did in the rest of the country. The party blamed the capital's 'educated, cultured and young' for the snub . Labour leader Ed Miliband greeted supporters and councillors at Redbridge Town Hall in Ilford, north east London. The party's success in the capital helped stem the national tide to Ukip . Labour gained Hammersmith and Fulham, Croydon, Merton and Redbridge councils, while the Tories picked up Kingston upon Thames from the Lib Dems and held on to Wandsworth, Bexley and Richmond. Ukip spokeswoman Suzanne Evans was asked to explain the party's poor performance in London. Speaking on Radio 4 Ms Evans admitted the party had difficulty appealing to the 'educated, cultured and young'. She said: 'I think it's simple and I think most people understand. London is its own person, its own body, its own individual character. 'It's very different from the rest of the country. Look at the social demographic - you have the sort of metropolitan elite who cannot really understand the heartache and the pain people around the country are feeling. 'We haven't really got our message across in London.' Boris Johnson, speaking during a campaign rally this week, was successful in heading off a Ukip surge - but saw Tory voters siphoned off by Labour . She said London had a more 'media savvy, well educated population'. She added: 'They are more likely to have read some of the negative press there has been about us. And I think they are more likely yo have believed it. 'People outside London have been far more cynical about the media campaign and the campaign the other parties have waged against us.' Ed Miliband's close ally Sadiq Khan is being credited with masterminding Labour's successful campaign in London . The contrast between London and the rest of the UK is set to pile pressure on the party's election co-ordinator Douglas Alexander. In London, Mr Miliband chose his close ally Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, to take charge of campaigning up to 2016. Mr Khan’s campaign focussed on bread and butter help for squeezed families, including higher pay, rent curbs, more housing and the cost of fares. Labour looks set to come first in both the contest for London’s eight European Parliament seats and in London-wide borough elections. Ukip is expecting to top the European elections when the results are announced on Sunday. It was polling 27 per cent as voters went to the polls - followed by Labour on 26 and the Conservatives on 22 with the Lib-Dems one point behind the Greens on nine. But in London, Ukip was trailing a distant third on just 20 per cent - behind Labour on 27 per cent and the Conservatives 23. In the London council contests, Labour was pollig 38 per cent, the Conservatives second on 33 and the Lib-Dems third on 13. Ukip was set to be backed by just 10 per cent of the public.","Metropolitan elite do not understand the rest of the country, say Ukip .

A rare flower has been discovered at a sewage plant, growing on a glass roof. The unusual spider orchid was spotted following reports that another rare flower had been seen in the same place last year, encouraging staff to keep a lookout. The plant, which was found at Swanage Sewage Treatment Works in Dorset, is so rare that it is protected under Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act. This means it cannot be uprooted, cut, sold or destroyed – as doing so is illegal. Ellen McDouall, senior conservation ecologist at Wessex Water, said: ‘This roof has only existed for ten years and the orchids can take that long to flower. 'We don’t know how they got on the roof, whether a seed was in the soil or blown in from nearby. ‘Thankfully the roof of the sewage treatment works is under no particular operational pressure, so we are hopeful we will be able to actively manage the land for the benefit of the plant.’ The limestone coastal cliffs around Swanage were one of only three UK strongholds for the orchid species, the others being Kent and Suffolk. A spokesman for Dorset Wildlife Trust said: ‘This is a lovely find as the spider orchid is so nationally scarce.’ Many of the species and habitats found in southern counties like Dorset are legally protected . The Wessex Water region is extremely rich in wildlife, and Dorset has some of the most bio-diverse land in the country. Many of the species and habitats found in the south are legally protected and represent the high level of biodiversity within the south west.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Controversial mining magnate Nathan Tinkler has handed in his keys at the Newcastle Knights after it emerged negative text messages were sent to players from his phone. After months of negotiations with a fed-up member base, Tinkler released a statement to The Daily Telegraph in which he confirmed he would give up ownership of the struggling club. 'This negotiation has dragged on for over 10 weeks and it is clear the Members Club has stalled the process,' the statement read. 'After injecting over $20 million of my own money it is time to stand aside, and hopefully the Knights will prosper and not revert to the old management style and formula that almost sent the club into liquidation 3 years ago. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Nathan Tinkler, pictured arriving at the Supreme Court earlier this month, is set to lose control of the Newcastle Knights amid allegations his phone was used to send 'abusive' text messages to players . 'We are determined to do everything to make it a smooth transition, but we require all accounts to be settled before leaving the Club — then it will be up to others to take the Club forward. 'Once all liabilities are paid there will be adequate cash flow available to support the new owners...The Club is in a far better position than it was when HSG took over, with the Club then drowning in $7 million of debt, inadequate administration facilities and no formal training facility.' Mr Tinkler said he had raised expenditure at the Knights during his time at the club and the transition would mean there would need to be spending cut. The move came on the same day it was revealed a number of high-profile players at the club received text messages from Tinkler’s phone in which they were called ‘soft’ and told ‘you’ll be gone by June 30’. Queensland representative Darius Boyd has reportedly been on the receiving end of a number of negative messages from Tinkler’s phone, the struggling fullback told he could be out of the club before the June 30 deadline for player trades. The Telegraph reported Boyd is ‘fuming’ about his treatment at the Knights and is owed $200,000 in overdue third-party payments. The text messages reportedly started at Round 2 and continued until recently. Star five-eighth Jarrod Mullen and numerous other senior Knights players reportedly beared the brunt of the ‘out of line’ correspondence as they toiled through the opening 10 rounds of the NRL season with just two wins. Fed up: Star fullback Darius Boyd is reportedly furious about his treatment at the Knights . Approached about the messages from Tinkler’s phone, Hunter Sports Group chief executive Troy Palmer told The Daily Telegraph via text message: ‘I assume you have evidence of this as this is a serious allegation and will take whatever action available. ‘Nathan has always had an excellent relationship with players. They love him. You obviously haven’t heard about how he visited Alex (McKinnon) last week a day before his ICAC hearing and helped Alex with the first movement of his legs.’ Mr Palmer and Mr Tinkler were before ICAC earlier this month over alleged donations to a Liberal Party slush fund.

With milk selling at up to $9 a litre in China it is set to provide a lucrative new source of income for dairy farmers in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, who have suffered in recent times due to drought and Australian supermarket 'milk wars'. Minister for Agriculture Barnaby Joyce said the deal would see an additional 20 million litres of milk exported to China over the next year. Fresh Australian milk has hit the shelves in Chinese supermarkets for the first time since a deal was struck by farmers in Queensland and New South Wales to speed up quarantine processes . With milk selling at up to $9 a litre in China the market is set to provide a lucrative new source of income for dairy farmers . 'With potential retail prices in China of $7 to $9 per litre of milk, this government strongly supports industry initiatives like this as they help our valuable agriculture sector improve international competitiveness, which also contributes significantly to better returns for producers at the farmgate,' Mr Joyce said. The deal cuts quarantine assessment time from two-to-three weeks down to about eight days, meaning fresh Australian pasteurised milk can now be sent to China within its shelf life. The new quality assurance protocols were developed by industry body Dairy Connect NSW, agricultural co-op Norco and export consulting firm Peloris Global Sourcing Pty Ltd along with Chinese officials. Norco CEO Brett Kelly said he had been inundated with requests from potential customers and retailers in China since making the deal. 'We sent over 4,500 litres in the first order and we've got customers talking to us in numbers of tens of thousands to millions,' he said. Farmer Luke Cleary, whose milk will sell to China, moves his dairy cows down the paddock on his dairy farm in Wauchope, NSW on Thursday . Mr Cleary, 33, said it was good to be expanding into a market where demand and prices are growing . 'It's all very exciting, the reaction has been bigger than what we thought. 'Our plan is to take it just a step at a time - every time you increase volume you need to be able to meet that supply.' Norco, an agricultural co-op made up of 190 farmer shareholders, is targeting the growing middle class in Shanghai, Sozhou, Nanjing. 'We've aimed specifically for the middle class which is a huge market, very wealthy, very well educated and have a very strong focus and desire on health,' Mr Kelly said. 'When they look at the Australian brand it is very high in terms of clean and green.' Norco farmer Luke Cleary, who owns 300 dairy cows in Wauchope near Port Macquarie, said costs on his farm were always increasing and it was good to expand into a market where demand and prices are growing. Luke Cleary, his wife Meaghan and their dogs Matilda and Darcy . Norco, an agricultural co-op made up of 190 farmer shareholders, is targeting the growing middle class in Shanghai, Sozhou, Nanjing . 'With all our costs going up we need to see the milk price follow suit otherwise there's less money at the end of the day,' he said. 'There seems to be a real demand for protein [in China] and as their personal wealth is increasing they're looking for better food sources and I feel that Australian food products should be able to fit that bill well.' Mr Cleary, 33, said local farmers suffered heavily during Coles and Woolworths milk wars last year which saw a litre of milk selling for $1. 'It was causing a negative feel in the whole industry that it was devaluing what the product was,' he said. 'Milk was seen cheaper on the shelf than bottled water.' A calf stands in a field as cows are being fed after a morning milking at a dairy farm on the Darling Downs, Queensland in 2013 . Adding to pressure on dairy producers was the recent drought which saw farmers forced to use up much of their stored feed. 'We've had one of the driest springs for 20 years, this summer just gone,' he said. 'A lot of stored feed that would have been put out into the autumn and winter months had to be fed out then because of it being so dry, the grass wasn't there that would have normally been there in summer time.'

"By . David Mccormack . Two members of the Wisconsin National Guard have been removed from funeral duty following an incident early this year when a photo appeared on social media sites showing soldiers joking around  an empty, flag-draped casket. The group photograph, taken at an Arkansas training facility, sparked backlash online where members of Facebook and military chat rooms condemned it for being disrespectful. The picture appeared on an Instagram account belonging to Specialist Terry Harrison, who received death threats over it, according to the National Guard. The Wisconsin National Guard has announced that Specialist Terry Harrison, together with Sergeant Luis Jimenez, have been permanently removed from funeral honors detail over the photo taken in February . Now three months after the incident, the Wisconsin National Guard has announced that Harrison, together with Sergeant Luis Jimenez, have been permanently removed from funeral . honors detail, reports the Army Times. Although Harrison and Jimenez will no longer be part of the . funeral team, they will continue to serve in the Guard, said Major Paul . Rickert. Sergeant Jimenez hadn't taken part in the photo, but had been suspended in the wake of the scandal after he attempted to defend his subordinate. Rickert said . the internal investigation into the social media incident is now complete . but it’s against the Wisconsin National Guard’s policy to share details . on any disciplinary actions. Outrage: More than 900 military families complained about the inappropriate pictures and comments . Although the offending photo, which showed a group of soldiers hugging, pulling faces and making peace signs around a coffin, was quickly taken down it had already been shared on other social media sites. A caption under the original photo read: 'We put the FUN in funeral - your fearless honor guard from various states'. In a second picture, complaints were made about attending an outside funeral in winter, with a post that read: 'It's so damn cold out ... why have a funeral outside!? Somebody's getting a jacked up flag.' Several military families were hurt by the disrespectful nature of the photo, and more than 900 contacted the guard to ask for the soldiers responsible to be disciplined. 'It . was like somebody slapped me in the face. I've never in my life seen . such disrespect for the fallen or the families,' Judy Vincent, whose son, Scott, died in Iraq in 2004, said. The mother, from Poteau, Oklahoma, added: 'It raises questions in your mind. What did they think of me, and was my loved one treated with disrespect?' Suspended: Terry Harrison, who has been removed from funeral duty, received several death threats . Miguel . Riley, a Kansas soldier wrote on Facebook: 'As the [non-comissioned officer in charge] for the honor guard of my unit on the active duty side, I am completely disgusted to see this.' Major Paul Rickert, the Wisconsin National Guard's public . affairs director, said he was appalled by the offensive photos and comments. 'A . military funeral is the final show of respect for our veterans and . their families, and we take that solemn duty very seriously,' Major . Rickert told ABC 19, adding that the photo and comments didn't appear . to meet the values the guard is expected to uphold. But Jimenez, Harrison’s supervisor, defended the photo, writing on a social media site, 'she isn’t disrespecting anyone. 'It’s actually a selfless commitment she has made. These practice sessions are very long. It’s good to let loose a little. When your job constantly asked you to be serious. And no there’s no one in the casket.' Major General Donald Dunbar, the Wisconsin adjutant general, added: 'We expect all of our soldiers and airmen to live by a core set of values, in word and deed.'","Photo appeared on social media sites in February showing soldiers joking around an empty, flag-draped casket .

"By . Richard Spillett . A woman was badly burnt when her electronic cigarette exploded in the middle of the night - because it was plugged into her phone charger. Lucy May, 22, was in bed asleep in the early hours of Tuesday morning when her e-cigarette suddenly burst into flames. The electronic device blew up after being plugged into an Apple USB socket - only meant for charging iPhones and iPads. Lucy May, 22, says she could have been killed in a fire started by a e-cigarette at her home in west Wales . The fire caused hundreds of pounds of damage after Miss May plugged her e-cigarette into her iPhone charger . Shocked Miss May woke up to find her bed was on fire and she later had to be treated in hospital after suffering burns to her legs. Miss May fears she could have killed if she hadn’t woken up in time - and is now warning people not to use phone chargers for e-cigarettes. Office manager Miss May said: 'I had my e-cigarette on charge and went to sleep - next thing I knew I woke up to a fire. 'The flames were crackling and roaring on my duvet and dressing table, I jumped out of bed and threw a suitcase over them. 'If I had been asleep for five more minutes I would have burned to death. 'I would say to people not to use a phone charger. With USBs you assume they are universal for any gadget - but that is dangerous.' The remains of the e-cigarette after Miss May plugged it into a USB charger meant for an iPhone . Miss May is now warning others not to make the same mistake she did and check instructions of e-cigarettes . Miss May, of Tenby, Pembrokeshire, has been trying to quit smoking since last year and bought two e-cigarettes for £35 in a local market. She put the silver eGo e-cigarette on charge at her home after returning from a weekend away. But it is thought the Apple USB socket she used was too powerful for the e-cigarette to cope with. She said it 'exploded like a bullet', sending four foot flames blazing around the bedroom of her £570,000 detached house. 'The flames were crackling and roaring on my duvet and dressing table, I jumped out of bed and threw a suitcase over them.' Lucy May after e-cigarette fire . Miss May woke up at 1am and began screaming and shouting 'fire, fire,' waking her father and twin sister Leila. Leila, who lives at the house with her two children, called 999 and fire crews soon arrived at the scene. Miss May, who was covered in melted plastic, was rushed to Morriston Hospital in Swansea, where she was treated for third degree burns to her hands, legs and the bottom of her abdomen. The blaze caused hundreds of pounds of damage to her duvet, bag and clothing as well as leaving scorch marks on the bedroom wall. Her family are now urging anyone with an electronic cigarette to check charging instructions carefully, particularly when using USB chargers. A Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'The fire was contained to a first floor bedroom. 'Fire crews used two breathing apparatus, one hose reel jet, thermal imaging camera, and a hydrant outside. One female was treated by paramedics for smoke inhalation and minor burns.' Electronic cigarette company eGo declined to comment on the incident. The . latest incident comes after fire crews investigating a fire . in East London earlier this year said they believe the blaze was started by an . e-cigarette on charge.

"By . Freya Noble . Lawyers defending three people committed to stand trial for taking part in the genital mutilation of two young sisters in Sydney say their clients' actions did not break NSW law. The lawyers for the girls' mother, a retired nurse and a sheikh said on Friday that a 'nick' or 'cut' does not meet the legal definition of mutilation. The girls were aged six and seven at the time of the alleged mutilations between October 2010 and July 2012. The 69-year-old former nurse, the girls' mother and a sheikh were ordered to stand trial by Magistrate Roger Brown at Parramatta Local Court on Friday. The two sisters were aged six and seven when the alleged mutilations took place . The nurse is accused of performing the circumcisions while the mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was present. The sheikh has been charged with being an accessory after the fact. He allegedly told locals to lie about the prevalence of female genital mutilation within their small sect of Islam. More... Pictured: The Pakistani immigrant who beat his wife to death in their New York apartment because she made him the wrong dinner - but his lawyer claims that's just his culture . Rolf Harris 'groped teenage girl's breasts before assaulting her mother at the same art event' Defence lawyers for all three argued that, unless circumcision and tissue removal are involved, it is technically not mutilation, and referred to male circumcision as an example. But Dr Brown ruled that 'all non-medical mutilation is prohibited. 'Any nick or cut to the clitoris will amount to mutilation,' he said. 'FGM is prohibited regardless of religion or cultural attempts to justify the practice.' He said the effects of genital mutilation should not be discounted. 'It's all too easy for adults to play down the unknown effects of genital mutilation of children,' he said. 'A small cut on the clitoris might sound trivial... but magnify that and apply it to male genitalia and most men would be hesitant to undergo the same procedure.' Dr Brown said, despite sound legal arguments from the defence, it was the children's evidence that he found 'powerful'. The older sister is said to have told investigators that she remembered 'suffering a cut to her private part' while her younger sister described 'being hurt in the bottom'. The matter will return before Parramatta Local Court on June 20. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","A former nurse, the girls' mother and a sheikh will stand trial .

"By . Louise Cheer . A crocodile expert has told how a ring on his finger saved his arm when he was attacked by one of his 2.5m maneaters . Craig West spent five days in the Royal Darwin Hospital and needed plastic surgery and stitches on his left arm when his saltwater pet, named Lucifer, turned on him while he was doing maintenance in the croc's pen. When Lucifer got hold of Mr West's fingers and thumb, he could feel the beast's teeth hit his bones. Scroll down for video . Craig West, who has been a reptile wrangler for decades, was attacked by his pet saltwater crocodile, Lucifer . 'He grabbed my fingers and pulled them sideways, it was lucky he didn’t have my whole hand or he would have gone into a death roll and ripped it off with my arm,' Mr West told NT News. But his injuries could have been a lot worse. A ring given to Mr West by his son a decade ago saved the reptile enthusiast's finger. The 43-year-old said he was lucky to escape last week's attack. Mr West was able to pull his hand free when Lucifer released it for a split second to get a better grip. 'A ring my son gave me 10 years ago was on my wedding finger and took a lot of the impact, it saved that finger because a (croc) tooth crunched right through it, the ring had to be cut off,' he said. The 2.5m croc almost took off one of his fingers but a ring saved it . But with decades of experience behind him as a reptile wrangler, this is not the first time Mr West has had a close call. He said this latest attack served as a reminder to others who wanted to tangle with salties. 'They’re not a pet they’re not something that’s ever going to be friendly with you,' Mr West said. Mr West (pictured here at the Royal Darwin Hospital) spent five days in hospital and required plastic surgery and stitches . 'You’ve got to be aware of that all the time because the instant they have the chance to go and grab you, they’ll grab you every time.' Mr West said a crocodile's reflexes were 15 times faster than a human's.","Craig West needed plastic surgery and stitches on his left arm .

"By . Kate Lyons . Queensland Premier Campbell Newman has come under fire for calling the people in the electorate of Logan, south of Brisbane, 'bogans'. The comment was made during a sitting of parliament on Wednesday, with Mr Newman interrupting a speech from one of his colleagues to refer to the people from Logan by the offensive term. The premier took to the floor again today to say that he had been taken out of context, insisting he did not think that 'the people of Queensland, in any electorate, are bogans.' Queensland Premier Campbell Newman has claimed his comments about the 'bogans in Logan' were taken out of context . Mr Newman insisted that he made the comments in reference to how he thought the people of Logan were perceived by Clive Palmer and the Palmer United member for Gaven, Alex Douglas. 'Let me be clear, the interjection I made was in reference to Mr Palmer and the member for Gaven's comments on what he thinks about his constituents,' Mr Newman told the parliament. He also insisted that his comment was not correctly reported. In the original Hansard transcript, which has been shared on social media, it is reported that the Member for Clayfield Tim Nicholls said: 'He [Alex Douglas] may have been doorknocking in the Rolls in Logan, which is yet another unusual way of connecting with the electorate.' Mr Newman is recorded as interrupting and saying: 'The bogans who live in Logan.' To which Mr Nicholls replied: 'Yes, indeed. We know what the member for Gaven thinks of his own electorate.' The original Hansard transcript recording Mr Campbell's comments has been shared on social media . The Hansard record has since been amended so that Mr Newman's interjection only reads: 'The bogans.' Mr Newman told the parliament today: 'On examining the footage, it is evident that what I said was different to what was recorded in Hansard.' 'I understand the mayor of Logan, Pam Parker, has taken offence to what was reported in Hansard and again, I would like to set the record straight. 'My government has worked hard for the people and city of Logan since coming to government. 'I look forward to continuing working with the mayor in the future and for the people of Logan.'

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Britain's first plastic banknotes are set to enter circulation in March 2015 to mark the 125th anniversary of the Forth Bridge, it has been announced. Two million of the £5 notes will be released by Clydesdale Bank to coincide with the anniversary of the opening of the rail bridge in east Scotland in 1890. The polymer notes are claimed to be more durable than existing currency - and also apparently stay cleaner for longer, are more difficult to counterfeit and are at least 2.5 times longer-lasting. Commemoration: Britain's first plastic banknotes are set to enter circulation in March 2015 to mark the 125th anniversary of the Forth Bridge, it has been announced. Above, Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael, Cabinet Secretary for Culture Fiona Hyslop (centre), and Clydesdale Bank executive director Debbie Crosbie . They will be introduced in Scotland ahead of England, where the Bank of England plans to issue them for the first time in 2016. The Clydesdale Bank note, which is smaller than the existing currency, also celebrates the nomination of the Forth Bridge for inclusion in Unesco’s World Heritage List in 2014. It features the image of Sir William Arrol, one of Scotland’s most celebrated engineers, whose company constructed the Forth Bridge, which connects Edinburgh with Fife. Debbie Crosbie, executive director at Clydesdale Bank, said: 'Clydesdale Bank is very proud to commemorate the Forth Bridge on our new £5 note. Made from plastic: Two million of the £5 notes will be released by Clydesdale Bank to coincide with the anniversary of the opening of the rail bridge in east Scotland in 1890. Above, what the notes will look like . Renowned: Mr Carmichael said the Forth Bridge 'truly reflects Scotland's position as a pioneer of engineering' 'The structure is renowned across the world as an incredible feat of engineering so it was a fitting choice for a ground-breaking new banknote. 'We continue to lead the way in banknote development and, following the successful introduction of a new series of notes with ‘Depth Image’ holograms in 2009, we are now at the forefront in polymer currency. 'The Forth Bridge’s super structure certainly lends itself to the intricate processes of banknote printing, combining security, durability and an aesthetically-striking design.' The bank said it has not yet made a decision about introducing plastic notes generally, but added that the new note will include a Spark Orbital security feature for the first time on UK currency. Design: The polymer notes will be introduced in Scotland ahead of England, where the Bank of England plans to issue them for the first time in 2016. Above, posters showing the design of the English polymer banknotes . Today, Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael MP said he was 'pleased' that Clydesdale Bank will commemorate the Forth Bridge on its new £5 note. 'The Forth Bridge truly reflects Scotland’s position as a pioneer of engineering, construction and its recent nomination to become a Unesco World Heritage site reflects its global status,' he said. 'As this new note becomes part of everyday life in villages, towns, cities and communities across the country, it will serve as a fitting tribute to the vision of Sir William Arrol and all the people who have contributed to the building, maintenance and restoration of the bridge in its 124-year history.' Contrast: The banknotes in circulation in England and Scotland today are made from cotton paper . In December, the Bank of England announced that it plans to issue plastic banknotes for the first time from 2016, when a new £5 note featuring Sir Winston Churchill will appear. A £10 note, also made from polymer rather than cotton paper and featuring Jane Austen, will follow around a year later. Fiona Hyslop, Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs, welcomed the launch of the Clydesdale banknote. 'Today we are celebrating two eras of Scotland’s innovation and foresight,' she said. 'The introduction of this innovative new banknote featuring the iconic Forth Bridge as a symbol of Scotland’s engineering heritage and ingenuity is very welcome. 'We are immensely proud of the Forth Bridge and its nomination for inclusion in Unesco’s World Heritage List. 'The launch of this banknote is such a fitting way to mark this nomination and Sir William Arrol’s work and I applaud the Clydesdale Bank for this gesture.' Meanwhile, Sara Thiam, director of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) Scotland, said: 'Sir William Arrol is one of Scotland’s most prolific civil engineers. 'Brought up in the Glasgow area, he developed methods of working and techniques which are still used today and is responsible for three of the world’s most iconic bridges - the Forth Rail Bridge, the Tay Rail Bridge and London’s iconic Tower Bridge. 'His legacy is littered with engineering ‘firsts’ so it is fitting that he is to feature on this celebratory first plastic banknote and underlines the vital contribution of civil engineers to society, past and present.'","Clydesdale Bank is set to release two million of the £5 notes in March 2015 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . 'Neighbours from hell': Steven and Fiona Young, pictured, carried out a nuisance campaign in an attempt to force out Peter and Lesley Raymond, a court found . It was supposed to be an idyllic second home, a rural Lake District retreat far away from the troubles of the rest of the world. But little did Peter and Lesley Raymond know when they settled on the lavish £600,000 Lin Crag Farm in Blawith, Cumbria, that they were buying in to a ruinous feud with 'neighbours from hell'. Mr and Mrs Raymond came to discover that their only neighbours, Steven and Fiona Young, would terrorise their home for years. And although their luxurious, well-appointed new home came complete with a helicopter garage, games room, bar and indoor badminton court, it was little comfort compared with the intractable family next door. The Youngs had lived in the neighbouring seven-bedroom Lynn Cragg Cottage for years - but had lived in the larger farmhouse decades ago and resented the new owners, who bought the property in 2009. Rotting rubbish was abandoned on their property, fences were damaged and their CCTV cameras were covered in paint - while at one point the Raymonds were even confronted with a sinister threat implying they could be murdered. Retreat: Mr and Mrs Raymond bought Lin Crag Farm, pictured, as a second home in 2009. Mr Young used to live there until 1965 when his father sold the house and moved his family into the smaller home next door . Conflict: The Youngs, who have now moved, lived in Lynn Cragg Cottage, which can be see to the left of this image. The more extensive Lin Crag Farm is to the right . But after a court battle - in which Mr and Mrs Raymond argued that their belligerent neighbours had slashed the value of their house - the Youngs have been left with a £600,000 bill. The family sued for for harassment, trespass and nuisance - and eventually won their case. The judge awarded them £196,000 damages, and the Youngs were left with an additional £400,000 in legal fees to pay - £200,000 for themselves and the same again for their opponents. Court papers show that at one point Mr Young told Mrs Raymond: 'I have lived here all my life and also all my family have lived here all my life, all their lives, hundreds of years, and you come in and really try to mess with s**t and it’s not on'. They logged incidents of rubbish mounting up or being ‘thrown’ into their courtyard, the Youngs’ dog and guinea fowl trespassing and defecating on their property and footballs being kicked against their walls. Second home: The Raymonds bought their farmhouse in 2009 for £600,000 . History: The farmhouse used to be owned by the Young family, but was sold in 1965 . In one incident, Mr Young was captured sticking two fingers up and mooning for the CCTV cameras. In one flashpoint, just weeks after the West Cumbria shootings, Mr Young told Mrs Raymond in a confrontation she recorded: 'We can all be pushed further than we want to go. Look at that poor guy in Whitehaven'. It was a reference to Derrick Bird who murdered 12 people 2010. Mr Raymond, 67, and wife Lesley, 57, bought Lin Crag Farm next door to the Youngs’ Lynn Cragg Cottage to use as a second home to their residence in East Sussex. The large estate is a mile from the centre of Blawith down a single-track lane set in open countryside. But the Raymonds were unaware that the property, bought for around £600,000 five years ago, had been the historic family home of Mr Young, 53, a former pub landlord at the Red Lion at Lowick. Accessories: The farmhouse comes with a helicopter garage, pictured . Sporty: The home also featured an indoor badminton court . He lived in it until it was sold in 1965 by his late father. The family then moved into Lynn Cragg Cottage next door. Though the Youngs cited an old agreement about leaving rubbish in the farmhouse so it could be more easily collected, the court decided that dumping bags on their land was part of a nuisance campaign to devalue the property and drive them away. A judge ruled in favour of the Raymonds and dismissed as ‘delusion’ claims from the Youngs that they had fallen prey to an ‘elaborate conspiracy’. It emerged in the hearing that previous owners of the farmhouse had also complained, with a previous resident calling them ‘neighbours from hell’. Neighbours: The entrance to Lynn Cragg Cottage is shown on the left, while the driveway to Lin Crag Farm next door is shown right . In his judgement, Recorder Duncan Smith found: 'Mr Young has been unable to accept the fact that he has no legal dominion over that property. 'It is clear from an examination of the historical evidence that it was his intention to make the life of those who occupy the farm a misery; that his campaign of belligerence has continued since the death of his father, that he has a deep-seated aversion to those wealthy enough to afford a second home the size of the farm, and that the notoriety of his conduct is an open secret in the locality.” The Recorder described Mrs Young as: ‘a plain-speaking lady with fixed interpretations of events to the point of being intransigent’. The Youngs have now left the cottage and rent another property in a neighbouring village. They deny that they are 'some kind of Asbo-family' and say the court case has 'destroyed' them. Mrs Young said: 'They have painted this picture of us as some kind of Asbo-family and we’re not like that at all. We’ve lived round here all our lives and have a good reputation and this has destroyed us. We’re not perfect but we’re good people.' 'They have made Steven out to be this big, aggressive man and he’s not that at all. He’s a pussycat but there’s only so far you can be pushed.' The Raymonds’ legal team did not respond to requests for a comment.","Peter and Lesley Raymond bought farmhouse in Blawith, Cumbria, in 2009 .

'Here's a tip, if you're getting up at 330am for your last show ever, maybe don't watch three hours of Survivor: Cagayan until1230am,' he tweeted. His Survivor-marathon explains the tone of a tweet last night, in which he  encouraged followers to tune into Wake Up. 'Don't forget, tomorrow morning is the exciting season finale of Wake Up.

It is unclear whether Kitson, Belling or Mathison, will remain at Channel 10, with a voluntary redundancy program set to be rolled out from this week. Wake Up was launched in November 2013, in a bid to compete with Channel Seven's Sunrise and Channel Nine's Today and rumours have been circulating for weeks that the struggling show might be about to get the chop. Wake Up was the brainchild of Sunrise mastermind Adam Boland, and was launched in November 2013, with three hosts, Natasha Exelby, James Mathison, and Natarsha Belling. Just 16-days later, Ms Exelby was cut from the panel, after it was decided the show's chemistry was not working. It has struggled to attract viewers, averaging 30-40,000 per day, around a tenth of the viewers tuning in to Channels Nine and Seven. In his email to staff informing them of the cuts yesterday, Channel Ten CEO, Hamish McLennan stated: 'Wake Up has not resonated with enough viewers to make it a viable program.' The extent of the redundancies are not yet known, but in his email Mr McLennan informed staff that the struggling network will also cut its 5.30am, 11am, and 10.30pm news bulletins, though it will continue to produce the 5pm news bulletin. 'It is a tough period for Ten and we need to take some painful, but necessary, measures to restructure the business,' the email to staff said. 'Unfortunately, it is proposed that Wake Up and the Early, Morning and Late News will cease production on Friday, May 23, 2014. Studio 10 is performing well and will continue as a vital part of our daytime schedule, which ranks number one.' He concluded the email saying: 'The next few weeks will be a difficult and sad period, as colleagues leave the business.'

"By . Becky Barrow . Under threat: Royal Mail used its first annual financial results announcement to warn that prices may have to rise . Royal Mail could be forced to increase the price of stamps unless the ‘unfettered’ rollout of rival postmen by TNT Post is brought under control, it was feared last night. It warned that TNT Post’s growth ‘could threaten the fundamental economics of the universal service’ – the rule that requires Royal Mail to deliver six days a week to every address in Britain. Deliveries have to cost the same whether a letter goes to London or Land’s End. Retaining this service was a key factor in Royal Mail’s sell-off last year. When it was floated in October, ministers insisted the universal service was protected by law. But Royal Mail chose the announcement of its first annual financial results as a private company to warn that the requirement was under threat because the firm was losing business to its competitors. TNT Post is not bound by the universal service and does not have to deliver everywhere in Britain. Royal Mail said this means it can ‘cherry pick’ lucrative deliveries and locations – only handling business post to large cities such as Manchester. Within three years, TNT Post’s expansion could cost Royal Mail more than £200million a year in lost business, it said. This would have to be recouped, leading to fears that the price of a stamp could rise – raising the prospect of £1 for first-class deliveries. A first-class stamp already costs 62p, up from 30p in 2005. TNT Post, which was launched in 2012, can avoid the unprofitable deliveries Royal Mail legally has to make. TNT can 'cherry pick' lucrative deliveries and locations rather than keep universal prices across Britain . It says its 3,000 orange-liveried postmen could be serving more than 40 per cent of British households by 2018. Around 70 per cent of business letters, such as bank statements and gas bills, are now handled by one of Royal Mail’s rivals. Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene yesterday called on postal regulator Ofcom to investigate TNT Post’s cherry-picking of what she called easy-to-serve urban areas. She added: ‘We do not believe the current situation serves the best interests of consumers. I’ve still got to have that postman on that walk whether he has got two items to deliver or 2,002. ‘Without timely intervention from the regulator, direct delivery competition will have a serious impact on the sustainability of the universal service.’ Part of the sell-off deal was the requirement that all letters would cost the same across the country . But Ofcom said: ‘We do not believe there is presently a threat to the financial sustainability of the universal postal service.’ It announced plans for a review in March last year, although it will not take place until the end of 2015. Royal Mail insists it should take place immediately. TNT Post chief executive Nick Wells said: ‘It’s time to stop  complaining and get on with promoting the postal sector in spite of the trend towards digital communications.’ The row comes as Royal Mail revealed it was making profits before tax equal to around £1million a day. It delivers 58million letters and parcels daily, with plans to trial the delivery of parcels on a Sunday this summer. Yesterday, its shares fell 9.7 per cent to close at £5.19 – the biggest faller in the FTSE index of Britain’s top 100 firms – amid fears about the threat posed by TNT Post. It floated at £3.30.","Key factor in last year sell off was that all letters would cost the same .

"By . Kate Lyons . A mansion complete with helipad, diving pool, fully stocked fishing dam, and panic room, is set to set to sell for $20 million, which would break the record for the highest house sale on the Gold Coast. The property, named Wirraway, is in the sleepy country community of Biddaddaba, between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, near known for its horse breeding. The house has four bedrooms and six bathrooms, and features two self-contained guesthouses, each with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. Wirraway in Biddaddaba on the Gold Coast is set to sell for $20 million, which would be the highest price fetched by a property on the Gold Coast . The home features a grand ballroom that can cater for up to 200 people . The house is on a 627 hectare block in the hinterland outside the Gold Coast . The property also features a grand ballroom that can cater for 200 guests, a helipad, 16 dams, including a fishing dam stocked with thousands of Australian bass, an airstrip, a library with floor-to-ceiling shelving, a large pool with a diving board, tennis court with fully enclosed tiered viewing pavilion, fully equipped gym, and a wine cellar with adjoining tasting room, which is fitted with bullet-proof glass and doubles as a panic room. It is being put up for sale by Brisbane diesel engine technician Preston Richardson and his wife Miranda. Mr Richardson owns Jet Boats Brisbane Pty Ltd. The couple bought the 627-hectare block in December 2012 for $3.575 million and have reportedly spent $14 million constructing and renovating the house, plus further millions fencing the property, improving pastures, and building and stocking dams. Wirraway also has a heated diving pool, complete with diving board . The property has 10 bedrooms and six bathrooms, split between the main house and two self-contained guest houses . The home also has an underground wine cellar with adjoining tasting room. The tasting room is outfitted with bullet-proof glass and doubles as a panic room . Shaun Kaddatz, marketing agent at Harcourts Coastal, which is selling the property, said that all up the couple have spent 'more than $20 million' developing Wirraway. 'It's one of the most incredible properties I've ever seen,' he said. 'I've probably seen some of the most spectacular properties [in Australia] but this beats it all.' 'It's based on the original colonial residence that was on the property, but it's a modern masterpiece when you walk through the door.' The couple bought the home intending it to be their personal residence, but a work commitment outside the area has meant they have to move and cannot live in it. He said their personal touch was evident when looking at the home. 'The size and quality and attention to detail… it's quite unbelievable, it has to be seen to be believed,' said Mr Kaddatz. The home is up for sale for $20 million and Mr Kaddatz is confident it will sell for that price to 'the right buyer at the right time.' If it does sell for the asking price Wirraway will become the highest selling home in Gold Coast history, beating 213 Hedges Ave in Mermaid Beach, which was bought by Harvey Norman boss Steve Cavalier for $19 million in 2006.

"By . Ian Drury . Lee Rigby’s mother yesterday called for a memorial to be built where her soldier son was brutally murdered. On the first anniversary of the Afghanistan hero being hacked to death by cleaver-wielding Islamic fanatics, Lyn Rigby said a permanent monument would mark his ‘sacrifice and pain’ in a proper way. But council chiefs and MPs have rejected calls for a site of remembrance. Some cite fears that it will inflame racial tensions and become a focus for Islamic and far-Right extremists. Scroll down for video . Lee Rigby's mother Lyn has called for a memorial to be built where her soldier son was brutally murdered . Mrs Rigby, 47, spoke out as she described being ‘trapped in hell’ by grief since her son was killed in broad daylight outside Woolwich Barracks, South-East London, a year ago yesterday. ‘A year on and you would never know Lee’s murder had happened,’ she said, fighting back tears. ‘There is nothing there to represent the sacrifice and pain my son suffered.‘The concerns that a memorial would attract extremists are a little late now. The terrorists did their worst when they killed my son. ‘By refusing to honour his memory in a dignified fashion, they are creating a platform for further political hatred and unrest. ‘Lee was a peaceful boy and we will never let his name be tarnished. ‘I only wish the politicians blocking his memorial could see the damage they are doing. They should be getting behind the wishes of most British people and honouring our heroes, not forgetting them.’ Lee Rigby, 25, of the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, had served his country courageously on the dusty battlefields of Afghanistan, risking his life facing Taliban bullets and roadside bombs. Lee Rigby, 25, of the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, had served his country courageously on the dusty battlefields of Afghanistan . But, having survived the deployment unscathed, the father-of-one was murdered on the supposedly safe streets of London on May 22 last year. In scenes of almost unimaginable horror, he was run over then stabbed to death in front of horrified onlookers in a gruesome attack by two Al Qaeda-inspired maniacs. The pair, known to the security services, shouted ‘Allah Akhbar’ – Arabic for ‘God is great’ – as they mercilessly killed the defenceless serviceman. Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were later convicted of the murder and jailed for life. A bronze memorial is being built in Fusilier Rigby’s home town of Middleton, near Rochdale, and his name will be inscribed on a monument for fallen servicemen at the National Memorial Arboretum, Lichfield. But nothing has been planned to commemorate the soldier in Artillery Place, where he died. Nothing has been planned to commemorate the soldier in Artillery Place where Lee Rigby died . More than 12,000 people have signed a petition organised by the Memorial For Lee Rigby campaign to raise money to build a plinth there. A number of religious groups, including the Islamic Society of Britain and the Conservative Muslim Forum, have supported the campaign. But local Labour MP Nick Raynsford has warned that a memorial could attract ‘undesirable interest from extremists’. Far-Right groups could use it to stir up hatred against Muslims and it might provoke jihadists into recruiting more terrorists, he said. The local council, the Royal Borough of Greenwich, and the Army have said the family are ‘not seeking an additional memorial’ in Woolwich. Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) were later convicted of the murder and jailed for life . But they have been dealing with Fusilier Rigby’s next-of-kin, his wife Rebecca. They later split up and the soldier had found new love with fiancee Aimee West, a military policewoman. Yesterday a council spokesman said it had conducted its dealings through the Army after receiving a number of bogus letters claiming to be from Fusilier Rigby’s relatives. The spokesman added: ‘The leader of the council is writing to Lee’s family today to establish direct contact with them and to ensure we can work alongside them as they continue to remember Lee and the sacrifice he made for his country.’ As crowds gathered in Woolwich, a private event was being held by Mrs Rigby, her partner Ian – Fusilier Rigby’s stepfather – his sisters Sara McClure and Chelsea Rigby, and widow Rebecca, with whom he had a son Jack, three. In an interview, Mrs Rigby said she was haunted by visions of her son’s death and had paid a midnight visit to his grave as she fought grief. She said: ‘No parent should ever have to bury a child but the nature of Lee’s death was so violent that I can barely sleep at night, haunted by the images of my child lying bloodied and fatally wounded on the street . Rebecca Rigby at the scene of Lee Rigby's death to mark the one year anniversary of his death . ‘If I close my eyes I see Lee covered in blood. And when I do fall asleep I have nightmares in which I am running to try to save my son. ‘I wake up in cold sweats with my heart thumping and feel like I am going to die. The grief is so intense it makes my body hurt physically. I don’t think I will ever get over my Lee’s murder.’ She described walking to his grave one cold and rainy night for the comfort of being close to the soldier. ‘I sat for half an hour beside his tombstone and sobbed in the dark. I talked to him as if he were still alive and told him how much I loved him. It was a very bleak and lonely time because the pain just wouldn’t go away. ‘Every day is like being trapped in hell and it doesn’t get any better.’ Mrs Rigby last saw Fusilier Rigby on Easter Sunday, March 31 last year - and seven weeks later he was dead. She said: ‘I still keep thinking Lee is going to burst through the door with a huge grin on his face. ‘Then I remember he has gone for ever. And I recall how he met his death and another giant wave of pain and sorrow engulfs me.’","Council chiefs and MPs have rejected calls for a site of remembrance .

"By . Associated Press . Swarms of lake flies are invading the Lake Winnebago area — clinging to everything in sight and leaving behind a green mess when squished. 'You just learn to walk with your eyes kind of half shut, and you don't wear real light clothes,' said Steven Spanbauer has lived on the west shore of Lake Winnebago for 27 years. 'Other than that, they don't really affect much.' Lake flies typically emerge around Mother's Day but cool weather delayed this year's hatch. What's that noise? The annual Lake Winnebago lake fly hatch is in full swing, with huge numbers staging an aerial assault on High Cliff State Park, in Sherwood, Wisconsin . Biblical invasion: Lake flies typically emerge around Mother's Day but this year's hatch was delayed by the cool spring weather. Lake flies don't have mouths, so they don't bite or eat vegetation . Sight to behold: The annual Lake Winnebago lake fly hatch is on! Swarms of the large, one-inch, harmless flies have invaded High Cliff State Park, Sherwood, creating one of the largest hatches in many years . They live throughout Lake Winnebago and the upper lakes and die within one to three weeks of hatching. Lake flies don't have mouths, so they don't bite. Scott Koehnke, a water management specialist for the state Department of Natural Resources, said warmer temperatures this week will result in a bumper crop of lake flies. Lake flies typically emerge around Mother's Day but this year's hatch was delayed by the cool spring weather. Lake flies don't have mouths, so they don't bite or eat vegetation. The lake flies spend the majority of their life in water, emerging only for a brief period as adults to mate. Sturgeon, perch and walleye feed on the larvae, known as red worms or blood worms, and pupae.

Landing wherever: Lake flies coat a garage at a home in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. There's a constant buzzing along the shoreline of Lake Winnebago . It¿s a sure sign of spring: Thick clouds of buzzing buggers known as lake flies are bothering fishermen and homeowners near Lake Winnebago ¿ and also folks near Lake Michigan . Perfect swarm: The lake flies are particularly bad this year. She told us the recent storms then heat and sunlight created perfect conditions for the hatch . 'They are the staple food source for the lake sturgeon throughout most of the year, as well as they're being consumed by pretty much any other fish out there,' said Ryan Koenigs, a DNR fisheries biologist. 'I've seen walleye stomachs that are loaded with lake fly pupae.' Koehnke said the current hatch will help migrating birds, which have struggled to find food in the cool spring. Purple martins and swallows had delayed nesting because of the lack of food. It will also benefit other birds that already are nesting or feeding their young. 'It's going to be a food source that's not always available at this time of the year,' Koehnke said. Mixed opinions: While the lake flies are are annoying, they don¿t pose any dangers to humans and they even provide some benefits to other animals . Circle of flies: The lake flies live as adults only a couple of weeks. They reproduce, lay their eggs in the water, die and the cycle starts over again . Tasty! Sturgeon and other fish are actually consuming the lake flies in the larvae and pupae stages, when they¿re in the water. Birds are also feasting on the adult flies .","The life span of a lake fly is extremely short with many living for just a few days after hatching .
On the ground a countless number of dead flies are visible .
Normally the flies hatch around Mother's Day, but the cold this year delayed their arrival .
Unlike mosquitoes, lake flies are harmless to humans .
They also serve as a valuable food source for hundreds of other species that live in the lake ."
"By . Peter Campbell . AstraZeneca is facing mounting pressure from its shareholders to do a deal to sell itself to US rival Pfizer, it emerged last night. Days after it rejected a £69billion bid for the company, the British drug maker’s largest investor has urged it to return to the negotiating table. US mega-fund Blackrock, which owns a 7.8per cent stake in the company, has told the board it was wrong to walk away from talks. Pensions funds and wealth managers accounting for around a sixth of its shares are believed to have urged the company’s board of directors to re-open talks with the US predator. US mega-fund Blackrock, which owns a 7.8per cent stake in AstraZeneca, has told the board it was wrong to walk away from talks. Earlier this week Astra rejected Pfizer’s ‘final’ £69billion offer of £55 a share. The move all but guaranteed its independence because Pfizer is now banned from hiking its offer any further under UK takeover law. But in three months’ time the legal ban expires, which would allow the Astra board to re-engage with the American company. While Pfizer is not allowed to approach AstraZeneca unsolicited for at least six months, the British group can open fresh talks as early as August. It is widely expected that Astra will face increased pressure to try and strike a deal. The proposed takeover would be the largest ever of a UK firm by a foreign company. But the deal has been widely criticised by scientists, City investors and MPs. Astra’s chief executive Pascal Soriot told MPs the takeover risked delaying the development of life-saving drugs that Astra is currently working on. Pfizer has also been criticised for its takeover motives, which is to help whittle down its international tax bill by moving its base out of the US. The US predator has almost 200 offshoots in tax havens, accounting for almost 40per cent of its international subsidiaries. According to reports, Blackrock told company directors they were right to reject the £55 a share offer, but said they should return to the deal-making table as soon as possible. The shareholder joins a chorus of critics that also include major investors AXA, Legal & General and Schroders. But other significant investors, such as Fidelity and M&G, have backed the board’s decision to terminate the negotiations. Blackrock, AstraZeneca and Pfizer all refused to comment.","Investor in British dtrug maker has urged it to return to negotiations .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . The U.S. soccer team's career scoring leader Landon Donovan was among seven players cut Thursday as the United States announced its 23-man World Cup roster. The 32-year-old attacker, bidding to make his fourth World Cup, was bypassed by U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann in favor of newcomers Aron Johannsson and Chris Wondolowski, who joined mainstays Jozy Altidore and Clint Dempsey as the forwards. The shock announcement came well before the June 2 deadline set by FIFA in advance of this year's World Cup in Brazil - which starts next month. Living legend: United States' Landon Donovan celebrates after scoring a goal against Mexico during the second half of a World Cup qualifying soccer match last year in Columbus, Ohio . Also cut were defenders Brad Evans, Clarence Goodson and Michael Parkhurst, midfielders Joe Corona and Maurice Edu, and forward Terrence Boyd - but Donovan's name is the one that stands out. Donovan has 57 goals in 156 international appearances and has been the face of American soccer for the past decade, both with the national team and with Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy, where he has won five titles. The most famous goal, his signature moment, was the stoppage time thriller in the 91st minute to give the U.S. a 1-0 win over Algeria in the 2010 World Cup to sent the Americans to the elimination round. 'It has been an honor and privilege to have represented the US National Team in three World Cups,' Donovan said in a statement posted to Facebook. 'I was looking forward to playing in Brazil and, as you can imagine, I am very disappointed with today’s decision,' he continued. 'Regardless, I will be cheering on my friends and teammates this summer, and I remain committed to helping grow soccer in the US in the years to come . Donovan was the star of the national team before he took a sabbatical of about four months after the 2012 season, spending part of the time in Cambodia. Klinsmann said upon Donovan's return last year that he would have to earn his spot back - but few thought he would not make the trip to Brazil. Left off the team: Landon Donovan, right, Mix Diskerud, center, and Chris Wondolowski warm up during a U.S. men's soccer team training session Wednesday, May 14, 2014 - Donovan will not be going to Brazil . He restored Donovan to the roster for last summer's CONCACAF Gold Cup, where Donovan excelled, and played Donovan for World Cup qualifiers later in the year. But Klinsmann kept him out of the starting lineup for last month's exhibition against Mexico, saying Donovan practiced poorly because of a knee problem. Donovan insisted this week his knee was OK, but Klinsmann clearly did not like what he saw from the attacking midfielder. Still, he did not take the cut lightly. 'This is certainly one of the toughest decisions…the toughest decision in my coaching career,' Klinsmann told ESPN. 'I'm very confident in my abilities and I think I'm deserving to be a part of the squad, but I have to prove that and I have to earn it,' he said Monday. When Klinsmann announced his 30-man preliminary roster on May 12, he said he viewed Donovan more a forward than a midfielder. 'I don't have that youthful energy and excitement that I did in 2002, but I see the game and I see the situation a lot more clearly now, so I'm able to I think enjoy it more in that way,' Donovan said. 'When you're younger, you're just sort of going crazy to do whatever it takes to make the team and you forget to enjoy it, And now I'm actually getting to enjoy it.' Reaction among most fans at the news of Donovan being left off the team was a mixture of outrage, shock and sadness. 'Donovan not making the US roster doesn't feel right,' New York Red Bulls striker Ryan Meara tweeted. 'Landon Donovan was not my favorite teammate in the world. With that said, this is a HUGE mistake to leave him off the World Cup team,' tweeted former MLS player Alecko Eskandarian.","Donovan's 57 goals in 156 national team matches are the most in U.S. Men's soccer history .
Had he made it to Brazil, it would have been his fourth and likely final World Cup .
His most famous goal came in in the 91st minute of a 2010 World Cup match against Algeria that put the U.S. into the elimination round ."
"By . Lillian Radulova . Federal MP George Christensen has received a death threat after posting a controversial Twitter comment regarding the budget on Thursday. The LNP member for the Queensland electorate of Dawson suggested that people who were unhappy with the tough budget measures, should try living in Asia before they complained. 'Aussies should do tour of Asia & live like locals to put these 1st world complaints re budget in perspective,' Mr Christensen’s tweet read on  Thursday. Federal LNP member George Christensen reported a death threat to the federal police on Monday, which he received after posting a controversial tweet telling Budget complainers to 'tour Asia' on Thursday . The generalised comment which verged on racism, also included a picture of impoverished Asian children in a slum background for added effect. Furious with the distasteful comment, dozens of Twitter users fired back with their own tweets labeling the comment as shameful. Greens member Adam Bandt was one of the many repliers, writing 'Or, @GChristensenMP, why don't you live 6 mths in Aust on no income (as u want under 30s to) & tell us how you get on'. Others rebuked Mr Christensen by criticising the budget’s $7.8 billion worth of cuts to foreign aid over five years, suggesting a reversal to alleviate the poverty problems the MP was pointing out. Unaffected by the backlash, the Queensland MP defended his tweet with a simple: 'Sometimes truth hurts’ while accusing 'the lefty twitter warriors' of going into meltdown. Mr Christensen also personally addressed a number of critics on the site, telling one that budget whingers' complaints were minuscule on a global scale. 'Try getting any serious form of welfare in Thailand or other SE Asian nations,' he replied to another. But things took a far more sinister turn when Mr Christensen revealed via twitter that he had received a death threat regarding his original post. The anonymous email, which Mr Christensen said he took to federal police on Friday, warned that MPs in Asian countries are assassinated and was accompanied by a photo of a man whose head has been blown off. 'Just remember arsewipe, those Asian countries also have a high number of MP (sic) that are assassinated. Aussies have GUNS.. Just remember that!' the email said. 'You have just become a MARK!' In an interview with the AAP, Mr Christensen revealed he didn't expect that his tweet would lead to such a serious and dangerous reaction. 'It's probably the most confronting email I've ever received,' he said. 'You receive nasty emails (as an MP)... I have a thick enough skin for that but I don't have a thick enough skin to stop a bullet from going through my head.' Mr Christensen also claimed anger about the budget was unwarranted, and debate about it needed to be brought down to a 'sensible level'. 'I think everyone needs to take a deep breath and calm down about it,' he said. Within his tweet informing followers that he'd received the threat, Mr Christensen also wrote that the Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten, was 'fanning this violence'. A spokeswoman for Mr Shorten described the remark as a 'disgusting new low' for the Liberal Party. 'If the prime minister has any sense, he'd instruct George Christensen to apologise for this offensive and irresponsible statement,' she said. 'There is a right way and a wrong way to protest this unfair budget - making threats like this is never acceptable.'

"By . Lillian Radulova . The 67-year-old sex-line worker known as Gloria, whose story of desperate measures made Australia's prime minister wink, has finally responded to the controversial incident. The Melbourne grandmother whose real name is Judith Power, told the Mail Online that Tony Abbott was as sleazy as some of her clients. 'I didn't see what he did until they replayed it on ABC news. I just couldn't believe it – it was the sleaziest looking smirk I've seen in a long long time and he looked sleazier than most of the blokes that ring me up…. And some of them are seriously weird,' Ms Power said.Scroll down for video . 67-year-old grandmother, Judith Power, who told Prime Minister Tony Abbott on talkback radio that she worked on a sex line to make ends meet just before he winked, has dubbed his behavior 'sleazy' and 'misogynistic' Mr Abbott has since admitted that he shouldn't have winked while listening to Ms Power's radio talk-back call while she told him she had to work on a phone sex line to make ends meet. He said the wink was directed at the host of the ABC radio program and was not meant to be disparaging of the caller, who described herself as a chronically ill pensioner in tough financial circumstances. Mr Abbott said he was looking at the host - the ABC's Jon Faine - and was winking his assent to take the call. 'Look, I was looking at Jon Faine, he was smiling at me and I winked back at him,' Mr Abbott told the Nine Network on Thursday. 'I shouldn't have done it ... I should have been more focused on the caller and less focused on the interviewer.' Asked if he was being disparaging towards the woman, Mr Abbott said he was attempting to engage with the caller. 'Mistakes are always regrettable ... and I will do my best having made a mistake yesterday to make none today,' he said. Mr Abbott has so far acknowledged that he shouldn't have winked during the interview, but claims that he was only winking his assent to take the call at the radio host John Faine . But Ms Power is not convinced, claiming the prime ministers words are just part of 'damage control' protocol. 'He wasn't leering at John – he was leering and sniggering because I said I was 67 and a sex line worker,' she said. Mr Faine's comments so far, have also been somewhat removed from Mr Abbott's claims. JON FAINE:Gloria in Warburton. Good morning Gloria you are talking to Tony Abbott the Prime Minister.JUDITH POWER:Hiya.TONY ABBOTT:Hi Gloria.MS POWER:Mr Abbott, I would like to ask you if you would like your mother or your grandmother to be in my situation. I am a 67 year old pensioner, three chronic incurable medical conditions – two life-threatening. I just survive on about $400 a fortnight after I pay my rent and I work on an adult sex line to make ends meet.[MR ABBOTT WINKS]Now, that's the only way I can do it. I've worked out and my maths isn’t crash hot that it’s going to cost me at least an extra $850 a year with the increases in medical visits and medication. I’m on a number of different medications that may probably increase as my conditions deteriorate. What do you suggest I cut out Mr Abbott – food, electricity, firewood, Christmas/birthday presents to my grandchildren or should we all just die and get out of your way?MR ABBOTT:Well Gloria, I absolutely understand that you're doing it tough – I absolutely understand…MS POWER:You don't give a stuff though, do you?MR FAINE:Keep it nice. Gloria, keep it nice. It's the Prime Minister you’re speaking to.MS POWER:No, I don't feel very nice about you Mr Abbott and why should I?MR ABBOTT:Well Gloria, what I want to do is get rid of the carbon tax, but you will keep the compensation that the former Labor government gave you to pay for the carbon tax. So, even if you spend $70 going to the doctor, even if you pay an extra 80 cents per prescription, almost certainly in pure cash terms, Gloria, you will be somewhat better off. Now, I’m not saying that you're on easy street, I'd never say that. Obviously you’re doing it tough. But let’s look at the reality here. The safety net kicks in after ten visits to the doctor – that's after $70 and yes there's an 80 cent increase in the pensioner co-payment, but you would’ve had an extra couple of hundred dollars a year as a result of your carbon tax compensation and we want to take that carbon tax off you. 'I raised an eyebrow because it's not every day that a grandmother on radio says that she supplements her pension by working on a sex call line,' Mr Faine said during his radio program on Thursday. 'It is a complete fabrication to say I somehow winked at the prime minister or was smirking or anything like that. Nor was I indicating that I needed his permission to continue which was the statement from the Prime Minister's office.' But the grandmother of three from Warburton, who doesn't have internet in her home nor follow social media, is still quite shocked at the amount of attention the incident has received. 'If he'd then just said ""I'm an old fashioned bloke and I got a bit embarrassed, and something like that happening had never occurred to me so I pulled a stupid face"", it would have been over by now,' Ms Power said. She described how she instantly received numerous calls of congratulations from friends and family before she fully understood the impact of what had happened. 'This has gone far enough, it's out of control – if he hadn't behaved how he did, what I said would have been forgotten by the end of the day if not before,' she said, revealing she was eager to get back to her normal life. Ms Power had called in to the Talk back show to let off some steam over the planned introduction of a $7 GP co-payment, announced in the budget. As a pensioner suffering from a range of illnesses including emphysema and arthritis, she revealed that she began to work on a sex line almost four years ago to make ends meet. 'I just survive on around $400 a fortnight after I pay my rent,' she told Mr Abbott. 'I work on an adult sex line to make ends meet. Now that's the only way I can do it.' Mr Abbott's faux pas, which was caught on camera, comes as he faces a collapse in his personal approval rating. The coalition is suffering in the opinion polls in the wake of the budget, with Labor having opened a 10-point lead on a two-party preferred basis at 55 per cent to 45 per cent. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, the only woman in Mr Abbott's cabinet, said there was nothing sexist in the prime minister's wink which was intended as a go-ahead signal for the call. 'I think people are far to quick to judge others through this prism of everything being about misogyny or sexism,' she told ABC radio. Ms Bishop said she was always treated with respect by Mr Abbott and her male colleagues in cabinet. 'Believe me, I've worked in some sexist environments and this isn't one of them,' she said. But Ms Power claims the complete opposite, telling the Sydney Morning Herald that she was glad the incident received attention. 'I was a catalyst for him showing himself for what he is, which is sleazy and a misogynist,' she said. Describing herself as a long-time feminist and anarchist, Ms Power said she was concerned about the fact that her real name had been revealed due to the line of her work.

"By . Lillian Radulova . Relationship: The woman seduced the boy when she was 22 and he was 13 (file picture) A Melbourne woman who repeatedly had sex with a 13-year-old boy and had three of his children has escaped jail. Victorian County Court Judge Christopher O'Neill sentenced her to three years in prison, suspended for three years. The woman now has six children and Judge O'Neill said her family circumstances had to be taken into account in the sentence. 'Normally offending of this seriousness would warrant a significant jail sentence,' Judge O'Neill said. '(But) there is a discretion to the court to grant special mercy where the circumstances of family hardship are exceptional.' Judge O'Neill said the woman's husband worked full time to support the children. 'I accept that almost every waking moment is spent looking after the children in one way or another,' he said. The woman, who cannot be named, began having sex with the boy in August 2004, when she was 22 and living next door to his family in Melbourne. The Victorian County Court was on Tuesday told the woman had three daughters to her victim, the first of whom was born when the boy was just 15. The woman, now 32, pleaded guilty to maintaining a sexual relationship with a child under the age of 16. Judge O'Neill said the woman gave the boy alcohol, drugs and freedom, but that was not evidence of grooming or predatory behaviour. The boy was 13 when the pair started having sex. They lived together for a time and had their first child when he was 15. The couple had two more children before they split up in 2009. Court case: She avoided jail time due to caring for six children, despite maintaining a relationship with the boy until 2009 . Prosecutor Francesca Holmes said the boy's mother tried to tell authorities while the relationship was occurring, but they declined to act when both denied it. Defence barrister Barnaby Johnson said after the relationship ended, the victim set up a hate page on Facebook directed at the woman. He said people put threats against the woman on the page, including 'die b**** die' and 'should be shot on sight'.The page has since been shut down. The boy reported the relationship to police in November 2011, but the woman wasn't interviewed until July 2012. When police did interview her, she said the boy had raped her and lied about the length of the relationship, Ms Holmes said. Ms Holmes said the woman has sole access to their children, and her victim had not seen his daughters since the relationship ended in 2009. Judge O'Neill said the woman had an IQ of 64 and showed the cognitive ability of a teenager. He also said the woman would be on the sex offenders register for life.","The judge showed leniency because she has six children to care for .

"By . Sarah Dean . and Australian Associated Press . Qantas has not ruled out removing life rafts from some flights in a bid to save cash. The airline is considering losing three life rafts from Boeing 737s that are not flying between Australia and New Zealand, but no decision has been made. The plans were revealed by South Australian Independent Senator Nick Xenophon, who was informed about the desperate money saving measure by pilots and cabin crew at Qantas who were concerned about the plans. Scroll down for video . Money saving: Qantas reportedly want to ditch three life rafts from their Boeing 737s . The politician is now demanding Australia's largest airline ditch the 'hare-brained scheme', which it is estimated could help preserve $1 million a year in fuel. It is not against rules to remove life rafts from 737s that do not travel more than 400 nautical miles off the coast. However, the rafts save lives and contain radios and rations for passengers if a plane crashes or is forced to make an emergency landing. Mr Xenophon wrote to Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce asking him to rule out the idea as a matter of urgency. 'If a plane has to ditch off shore, every minute counts, and the savings are a joke. It might be a million a year in fuel, but they’re burning up $4 million a month with planes on tarmacs (due to issues with their Asian ventures),' he told The Adelaide Advertiser. Risky: It is not against rules to remove life rafts from 737s that do not travel more than 400 nautical miles off the coast . Concerned: South Australian Independent Senator Nick Xenophon (left) reportedly wrote to Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce (right) asking him to rule out the idea as a matter of urgency . Regulations demand planes should have enough rafts to carry every person on board the plane, unless they are only flying within certain parameters. On Friday a Qantas spokeswoman told MailOnline no decisions had been made regarding changes to on-board equipment. 'Qantas would not implement any change that would compromise safety or Civil Aviation Safety Authority's strict standards,' she said. 'Any suggestion that we would compromise safety is wrong and scaremongering.' A spokesman said historically, Qantas has operated flights without rafts when regulation permits. 'It is common practice for airlines both here in Australia and internationally, to not carry life rafts on some aircraft, in accordance with safety regulations,' he said. Virgin Australia leaves life rafts off some flights that travel under 400 nautical miles from land. A spokeswoman said Virgin meets all regulatory requirements for all Australian and international destinations it services. 'Life rafts are carried on all services flown over water which travel 120 minutes from land (at normal cruising speed) or 400 nautical miles (whichever is less),' the spokeswoman said in a statement. The money saving news comes the day after the war between Qantas and Virgin Australia over capacity in the domestic market appeared to come to an end. The two airlines have been rapidly increasing their number of domestic flights, and the size of planes used on those routes, since last year, at the expense of profit. Qantas Domestic's profit plunged by 74 per cent in the first half of the financial year, as the airline's overall loss widened to $235 million. It now plans to pull back from its capacity war with Virgin, and will add no new seats in the first three months of the 2014/15 financial year. That will mean using smaller planes and fewer flights in non-peak travel periods than the airline had been planning. Qantas said demand had fallen, due to weaker consumer confidence and a reduction in new mining work in Western Australia.","Airline considers getting rid of life rafts on some Boeing 737s .

Oxford graduate Gary Stocker, 30, had a £1million home and six-figure salary as a law writer and legal recruitment officer. But he has left all that behind to live in a caravan with a travelling circus and perform as The Great Herrmann. Mr Stocker set up Chaplin’s Circus with friend Mark Foot. Former lawyer Gary Stocker has launched himself on a new high-flying career path - as a human cannonball . Mr Stocker, 30, lives in a caravan with a travelling circus and performs as The Great Herrmann . He has spent tens of thousands of pounds funding 20 performers and the purchase of a 1,400-seat circus tent – the largest in the UK. He said: ‘Perhaps I only went to Oxford to please my mum – I realised that being in the circus was what I was destined for. ‘The circus is even harder than my previous jobs in terms of hours, but it brings freedom and variety. ‘It’s so exciting, and every day brings something new.’ The Oxford graduate used to have a £1million home and six-figure salary as a law writer and legal recruitment officer before his career change . Describing how he came to his life-changing decision, he said: ‘When I was in legal recruitment I got a really big sum of money one month. ‘Then my boss said to me “You’re going to make so much money you won’t be able to leave”. ‘That’s when I decided it was time to go. I couldn’t be enticed by the money as I knew it wasn’t what I really wanted to do.’ But it wasn’t until his friend Mr Foot, 30, a street performer, suggested joining him that he realised he was destined for a new kind of high-flying career. ‘When Mark put his proposal to me I realised that being in a circus was what I was destined for. I thought about his offer for all of 15 minutes before giving him a resounding “Yes”,’ he said. ‘My mum had always done her best to send me to the best schools and I presumed that she would be disappointed in me if I did not enter a profession, such as law or medicine. But I was totally wrong – she is proud of me whatever I choose to do.

"By . Freya Noble . An Australian man who was critically injured in road accident in Bail has arrived in a Melbourne hospital to receive further treatment. Nicho White, 43, is in a serious but stable condition at The Alfred Hospital. Mr White did not have medical insurance and his family had to come up with more than $100,000 so he could be transferred to the hospital. Thanks to support of high profile friends such as Olympic swimmer Michael Klim who also lives in Bali, and Melbourne-based musicians The Cat Empire, a fundraiser on youcaring.com raised the much needed money. White's collision on his motorbike with a 4WD driven by a local man left him in an induced coma with serious head and internal injuries last Friday. Nico White, 43, has spent the last six days in an induced come on life support in Bali, but is not on his way back home to Melbourne . Police have confirmed they won't press charges over the accident, and have denied claims the incident was a hit-and-run. Head of Badung Police Komang Suartana said the other driver was overtaking a motorbike when he hit Mr White, but he was released after questioning. 'The incident was a pure accident,' he said. '[The driver] didn't run away and stayed at the scene and was ready to take responsibility.' Stepfather Ian McGill said the support had been a comfort in an anxious time for the family who relocated to Bali two years ago. 'It has been overwhelming, the number of good wishes we've received,' he told AAP. Mr White was hit by a car while riding his motorbike early on Friday morning . But for Mr White, who has failed to wake from his induced coma, the flight itself, which left on Thursday morning is the first of many hurdles. The plane carrying life support equipment and a medical team flew at low altitude and speed in order for him to survive. On Tuesday, Swimmer Michael Klim started the push for fans to help bring his 'dear friend' Nicho White home to Australia from Bali, after he suffered the 'worst possible' brain injury in a motorbike crash. 'Our dear friend Nicho White who lives in Bali was in a serious accident and is fighting for his life in intensive care and needs your help to get him back home for treatment ASAP,' Klim wrote on his Facebook page. 'Head to Save Nicho White Appeal and donate now, please I’m begging you,' the Olympian medalist added. Klim also lives in Bali with his wife Lindy, a Balinese princess. Begging: Swimmer Michael Klim (pictured here with his wife Lindy on Wednesday in Sydney) has urged his fans to help bring back his 'dear friend' from Bali . Mr White's intensive care in a Denpasar hospital after his accident was costing his Melbourne family up to $6000 a day. The once-fit surfer is suffering from serious head, chest and leg injuries and doctors have advised it was be best to medically evacuate him to Australia, at a cost of about $100,000. Celebrities including high profile fashion designers such as Alice McCall and Nicholas Morley had previously contributed to the fundraising page. Ms McCall wrote: 'Dear White Mcgills, you are like family to me, I hope this donation can help with Nicho’s fight to service. He is a strong sweet kind funny talented human being who is meant to be here with us on earth for years to come. Nicho there is so much love for you, shine on .Alice xxxx'. Stepfather Ian McGill said attempts to bring Mr White out of the coma have so far been unsuccessful. 'In the scheme if seriousness, I think the doctor said it's the worst he's seen in terms of possible brain injury,' Mr McGill told AAP on Tuesday. The accident happened in the beachside town of Kerobokan in Bali . 'We really don't know what the outcome will be.' The fundraising page on the website youcaring.com has now raised more than $107,000 - slowly climbing to its goal of $250,000, which family say will contribute to the cost of rehabilitation. The fundraiser was set up by his stepfather Ian McGill, and his mother Lyn McGill. Ms McGill has been proving updates on Nicho's condition on the page, and recently wrote about the extent of her son's injuries, and that she would be travelling to Melbourne with him. 'He is actually a multi trauma patient because of other complications - eg. seriously broken leg, liver damage, threat of pneumonia...However our priority at this stage is to stabilise his brain injuries and get him breathing without the assistance of machines.' So far, attempts to bring the 43-year-old out of the coma have been unsuccessful . Mr McGill said support has come from Melbourne, where he and his wife lived until two years ago, and Bali, a second home for years before that. In Bali, Mr White designs jewellery and his sister Jessie is the founder of fashion label Shakuhachi, with stores in Bali and Australia. There were initial reports the accident was a hit-and-run.

"By . Ian Drury . In Afghanistan, they faced the horrors of war together - a courageous young soldier and his loyal canine companion. But Lance Corporal Kenneth Rowe, 24, and Sasha a four-year-old yellow Labrador, also died together. Killed in a Taliban ambush while on patrol. Yesterday their memory was honoured when the Army sniffer dog who lost her life alongside her handler was awarded the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross. Lance Corporal Kenneth Rowe, 24, and Sasha a four-year-old yellow Labrador were killed in a Taliban ambush while on patrol . She received the PDSA Dickin Medal posthumously for uncovering 15 bombs and hoards of weapons - thought to be more than any other British dog in the 13-year conflict. Her citation read: ‘Sasha’s actions were conducted in perilous conditions over a sustained period. Without doubt she saved many soldiers and civilians from death or injury.’ Her calm presence and wagging tail also comforted and reassured soldiers risking their lives on the frontline.

Sahsa and her handler were both killed in Helmand. Sgt Maj Dobbs had been her handler before L/Cpl Rowe, who was killed in a Taliban ambush while on patrol. At a special ceremony, Sasha’s posthumous medal was accepted by her previous handler Sergeant Major Andy Dodds and ex-sniffer dog Fire, a five-year-old black Labrador who was seriously injured in a bomb blast in Afghanistan two years ago. L/Cpl Rowe’s proud family - father Ken, 63, mother Lyn, 55, and sisters Jenni, 32, and Steph, 27 - and former Army comrades were at the touching event in Kensington, west London. Mrs Rowe, a legal practice manager from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: ‘Kenneth would be over the moon. If he is looking down he would be proud as punch that his dog had received an award for her hard work, devotion and life-saving. ‘It is no compensation for our loss but we feel proud and elated that recognition has gone to two who deserve it.’ L/Cpl Rowe, served with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps’s 104 Military Working Dog Squadron, attached to the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, in Helmand Province. He had asked to work with Sasha when his previous dog, Diesel, another golden Labrador, was injured in an IED attack on a vehicle they were travelling in. The back page of the order of service for the 2008 funeral of Lance Corporal Kenneth Michael Rowe . Sasha’s key role in the warzone was to sniff out hidden arms caches, improvised explosive devices and bomb-making equipment so soldiers could patrol safely. On one occasion she was searching a mud-walled building when she detected two mortars and a large quantity of weapons, including explosives and mines. During their time together, L/Cpl Rowe and Sasha ‘forged a unique bond’, said commanders. The pair were considered the best handler and dog team in the region. But the pair were killed in a rocket-propelled grenade attack while taking part in a mission in Sangin, a Taliban stronghold, in July 2008. L/Cpl Rowe had been due to leave the frontline the day before he died but he had volunteered to stay on because he was worried about his base not having enough search cover for comrades. PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin said: ‘This is about recognising the immeasurable contribution to military operations made by Sasha. Sasha¿s posthumous presentation brings the total number of Dickin Medals awarded to animals in war to 65 . ‘Whilst it is a sad day for L/Cpl Rowe’s family and the Army, they should be extremely proud that their exceptional devotion to duty in Afghanistan saved many lives, both soldiers and civilians. ‘The award is even more poignant as we approach the centenary of World War One and are reminded of the huge debt we owe the animals who serve in times of conflict.’ Colonel Neil Smith, director of Army Veterinary and Remount Services, said the unit was ‘delighted’ that Sasha had been honoured. He said: ‘Our soldiers and their dogs do a tremendous job, a job that saves countless lives. It is an honour to share this important day with L/Cpl Rowe’s family to recognise the work that he and Sasha undertook before being tragically killed.’ The Dickin Medal is the highest accolade that an animal can receive for saving human life while serving in a warzone. Sasha’s posthumous presentation brings the total number of Dickin Medals awarded to animals in war to 65. Since it was introduced by PDSA founder Maria Dickin in 1943 it has been awarded to 29 dogs, 32 Second World War messenger pigeons, three horses and one cat.","Lance Corporal Kenneth Rowe, 24, and Sasha died in 2008 grenade attack .

"By . Associated Press . More spring thunderstorms delivered hail and triggered tornado sirens in Colorado on Thursday as hail storms, small tornados and strong winds hit states in the West and Northeast, as more wet weather is forecast for Memorial Day weekend. In Colorado, heavy hail briefly pounded downtown Denver, and more hail was reported in Red Feather Lakes northwest of Fort Collins, while a severe thunderstorm watch was issued for New York City and New Jersey on Thursday afternoon. Campers in the campground of Bellaire near Red Feather Lakes were evacuated after hundreds of trees were knocked down, blocking roads into the campground as the Memorial Day holiday weekend got underway. There were no reports of injuries. A thunderhead forms over downtown Denver on Thursday as more spring thunderstorms began rolling in . The National Weather Service has not . confirmed if a tornado touched down in the area. The area was under a . tornado warning earlier in the day. Fans watching the Colorado Rockies play the San Francisco Giants at Coors Field were told to seek safety in a lower concourse as tornado sirens wailed. The tornado warning soon expired. Several incoming flights to Denver International Airport were delayed to let the storm pass, airport spokesman Heath Montgomery said. In New Mexico, severe weather and large hail caused multiple car wrecks in the northern part of the state Thursday. Elsewhere in the West, a small tornado in a rural area of eastern Idaho on Wednesday caused no damage or injuries, authorities said. Saturday Forecast: The Midwest and Northeast is set for more thunderstorms and wet weather over the weekend but the West Coast and Florida has sunshine on its way . Sunday Forecast: Florida is set for thunderstorms and wet weather along with the Midwest and Northeast . In the eastern United States, hail and strong winds caused damage in Virginia, New York state, Delaware and Pennsylvania. A jetliner that flew through a hailstorm on its descent into Philadelphia landed with a cracked windshield. US Airways says only one layer of the multilayered windshield was cracked and Flight 768 en route from Orlando, Florida, landed safely. No one was injured. In Delaware, two people were injured when high winds damaged about a dozen homes in the Kent County community of Marydel, emergency officials said Thursday. No significant damage was reported from Colorado's twisters, and the latest round of storms wasn't expected to be as extreme or as widespread as that seen Wednesday.

A microburst was blamed for ripping a section of metal sheeting off the roof of Castle Rock's town pool. There weren't any tornadoes in Lafayette, north of Boulder, but some residents probably got a scare when tornado sirens mistakenly sounded around 3 a.m. Thursday. Engineers were investigating whether a software error was to blame. Lower-level winds weren't forecast to be as strong Thursday, which meant any tornadoes would likely be short-lived, National Weather Service meteorologist Kari Bowen said. The chance of afternoon thunderstorms along Colorado's Front Range will continue through Memorial Day weekend.

"By . Jill Reilly . A New York taxi driver who hit and killed a nine-year-old boy will not be charged because of 'two strikes' loophole in the law. Cooper Stock was crossing West End Avenue with his father in front of their apartment building in January when police say driver Koffi Komlani failed to stop, hitting them both and crushing Cooper under the wheels. But now his mother has revealed Komlani of West Harriman will not spend a single day in jail because of a bizarre gap in the law which requires two separate citations to prove criminality, reports Eyewitness News. A New York taxi driver who hit and killed Cooper Stock will not be charged because of 'two strikes' loophole in the law . Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance concluded he could not charge him with vehicular homicide and police cited Kolmani with just one citation - failure to yield to a pedestrian. He will get a couple of points off of his license and possibly pay a $300 fine. The TLC has now revoked Kolmani's license to drive a cab. The news has devastated Cooper's parents. 'I felt like I was living on Mars all of a sudden,"" says Dana Lerner, 'like how is this possible? This makes absolutely no sense.' The accident happened when Cooper and his father were coming home from dinner on January 10 at about 8:30pm. Cooper Stock was crossing West End Avenue with his father Dr. Richard Stock in front of their apartment building in January when police say driver Koffi Komlani failed to stop, hitting them both and crushing Cooper under the wheels . Komlani turned left from 97th Street onto West End Avenue, striking both as they crossed the avenue. Ramon Gonzalez was driving just behind the yellow cab and tried to save Cooper told the New York Daily News: 'He had to be distracted because there’s no way he could not see them, if I did.' 'The father grabbed his son. They were both on the hood of the car for a second. The father fell off the passenger side. The son went underneath the driver’s-side tire, first the front one, then the rear.' His father, Dr. Richard Stock, a radiation oncologist suffered a minor leg injury . Gonzalez dialled 911 and an ambulance took Cooper to St. Luke’s Hospital, where he died. His father, Dr. Richard Stock, a radiation oncologist whose patient list includes former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, suffered a minor leg injury. On Thursday, the DA's office told Eyewitness News that the state law makes it much harder to prosecute fatal crashes as homicides even if the driver is at fault. Dana Lerner is now pushing a new law in Cooper's name - to suspend cab drivers automatically if they seriously hit a pedestrian, until an investigation clears them of any wrongdoing. 'If a life is saved because of my son, that is the best thing I can have,' she said. 'It keeps him alive and gives him a legacy.' Lerner told the New York Post that she struggles when leaving her apartment as want to pass the place less than a block away where her son was killed. 'If I have to go out that way, I cover my eyes. I can’t look there. When I do, I see what I saw that night . . . which was this stillness about him,' she said. Earlier this year in a letter to family and friends, the family had expressed sympathy for Komlani. 'We cannot even find in our hearts at this time to feel anger toward the cab driver, who we know must be suffering too,' the family said in a letter to friends. 'It would give some meaning to this senseless nightmare if it serves as a reminder to people to drive extra carefully and give extra hugs to their children.'","Cooper Stock was killed crossing West End Avenue with his father .

"By . Associated Press . The armed auto thieves have become so common that parts of the bankrupt metropolis are referred to as 'Carjack City,' and many motorists fear getting out of their vehicles even for a few moments to fill a tank. So gas stations are taking steps to protect customers, and the city has formed a special police team to go after suspects. Convicted carjackers will even get their faces and prison sentences plastered onto billboards. Greg Champion wears a gun while pumping gas in Detroit.

Authorities blame . many of the carjackings, ironically, on improvements in vehicle . security. Anti-theft equipment, GPS systems and advanced locks now . prevent many vehicles from being driven without a key in the ignition. That . makes it difficult or impossible for thieves to steal parked cars, . leading them to target vehicles that are occupied, said Jonathan . Parnell, of Detroit's auto-theft squad. Also contributing to the thefts is a strong demand for stolen wheels and tires, police said. Through May 19, Detroit has recorded 191 carjackings in 2014. In 2013, it had 720, considered a high number given Detroit's population of 700,000 .

You get better protection . with that big sticker in the window that tells criminals there is proper . equipment that will help police investigate these crimes.' Through May 19, Detroit has recorded 191 carjackings in 2014. Detroit . police reported 720 carjackings last year in the city of fewer than . 700,000 people. That's down from nearly 850 in 2011 and 1,231 in 2008. The . decline may partly be due to Detroit's freefalling population, but the . thefts still exceed the carjackings in some comparably sized U.S. cities. Sharlonda Buckman, . executive director of a Detroit nonprofit, was at a gas station on an . October morning when she ran inside for aspirin. Back inside her SUV, . she was just closing the door when she saw a carjacker shove his gun . inside. She screamed and . jumped out of the vehicle. The carjacker jumped in and drove off. Three . other customers gave chase in their vehicles. One caught up to the SUV . and got shot in the leg by the carjacker, who was later arrested. In a photo shot from video provided by the Detroit police, car thieves take the tires off a Ford Fusion. Detroit has actually seen a decrease in carjackings between 2011 and 2013, but it could be the result of many people moving out of the city . Now, Buckman said, she tries not to pump gas at all. 'If the night catches me, I won't pump gas in the city,' she said. 'Or I'll call somebody to meet me.' It's . difficult to know how Detroit's carjackings rank nationally because . many police agencies lump carjackings with all armed robberies in annual . reports to the FBI. Newark, . New Jersey, with a population of 280,000, had 382 carjackings last . year, giving it a per capita rate that is actually higher than . Detroit's. Memphis, Tennessee, with a population of 655,000, had . slightly more than 400 carjackings over three years from 2011 through . 2013. El Paso, a rapidly growing western Texas city of 670,000, reported . only 15 carjackings last year and 18 in 2012. Through . May 19, Detroit has recorded 191 carjackings in 2014, including the . Feb. 24 shooting death of CVS security guard Courtney Meeks, who rushed . toward a car being taken by three men, and the Feb. 4 slaying of Donald . Bradshaw, a 68-year-old man who was beaten to death with a tire iron . after he was carjacked at an intersection. Prosecutors, . the FBI and Detroit police recently announced a campaign to spread the . word about stiffer federal penalties for carjacking, which can include . the death penalty if someone is killed. A similar campaign that includes . billboards with photos of convicted carjackers started last summer in . Newark. Detroit police have . also announced a partnership with General Motors' OnStar roadside . assistance service to track down stolen vehicles and promote rewards . tied to an anonymous tip line. To avoid becoming a victim, security guard Greg Champion wears a handgun on his hip whenever he's pumping gas. 'I . don't want to surprise you,' Champion said. 'I want you to know I'm . armed, and I want you to know I can defend myself, and I want you to go . somewhere else.' Christine . Reed takes the opposite approach. The 27-year-old mother of two won't . stop for gas in Detroit. She lives north of the city in Warren and works . four days a week cleaning offices downtown. If she's in a bad section of town, Reed said, she passes through red lights because it's tougher to carjack a moving target. 'It's not a safe place anymore,' Reed said. 'It's dangerous.' The . state-appointed emergency manager tasked with restructuring Detroit's . $18 billion in debt has said crime needs to be reduced to make the city . attractive to new residents and businesses. That's . going to take more and better resources, said Wayne County Prosecutor . Kym Worthy, who complains that she has only a few assistants to try . carjackings. 'When nobody has any resources ... all we can be is reactive,' she said.","Some gas station display a green-decal with a lighthouse, meaning they are participating in the city's anti-carjacking program, but many other stations are on a waiting list .

"By . David Mccormack . A mom of two is gunning for the New York Department of Education after her pencil-thin daughter was sent home from school on Wednesday with a letter informing her parents that she is overweight. Laura Bruij Williams, from Staten Island, New York, was tucking her daughter Gwendolyn in for the night when the young girl asked her if she was fat. ‘She said, “Hey, Mom. The school told me I’m overweight.” And then she started jiggling her thighs, and saying, “Is this what they mean?’” Laura Bruij Williams, from Staten Island, New York, is gunning for the New York Department of Education after her pencil-thin daughter, Gwendolyn, was sent home from school with a letter claiming that she is overweight . ‘That was heartbreaking,’ the stay-at-home mom told the New York Post. According to Gwendolyn’s Department of Education-issued Fitnessgram she is 4-foot-1, 66 pounds and has a Body Mass Index of 19 which puts her in the ‘overweight’ category rather than ‘healthy weight.’ The third grader, who attends PS 29 Bardwell, was one of more than 800,000 public school students, grades K through 12, who were weighed and measured back in November as part of an Office of School Wellness Program. ‘It is so unnecessary,’ Bruij Williams told Mail Online. ‘Parents should be in charge of the health of their own children and then it is something for them to discuss with their pediatrician.’ Bruij Williams took to Facebook to voice her anger at the New York Department of Education labeling her daughter as 'overweight' 'Parents should be in charge of the . health of their own children and then it is something for them to . discuss with their pediatrician' Instead of posting the information to parents, it was handed out at school. Kids were told not to open the Fitnessgrams, but for many it was simply too easy to view the information which was only sealed with a small sticker. According to Bruij Williams, several children were in tears on the school bus after they opened their Fitnessgrams and were shocked to find themselves labelled fat. 'Girls shouldn't be crying on the bus at 8 years old because they read a piece of paper saying they're obese,’ she wrote on her Facebook page as she and other upset moms voiced their frustrations with the Department of Education. According to the BMI system used by the Department of Education, Gweddolyn was just one pound overweight. Gwendolyn, right, is a healthy, self-confident nine-year-old who lives with her parents and younger daughter in Staten Island, New York . 'Girls shouldn't be crying on the bus at eight years old because they read a piece of paper saying they're obese' However her mom says when she ran the same stats through another BMI tool and her daughter came out in the middle of the ‘healthy weight’ section. 'My daughter shouldn't be going to sleep and looking at her thighs and belly, wondering 'is this what they mean?' she said. Fortunately Gwendolyn is a healthy, self-confident nine-year-old and hasn’t taken the ‘fat-shaming’ to heart. ‘I know that I’m not overweight, so why should I believe the New York Department of Education?’ said the young girl, who enjoys playing softball. The Fitnessgrams were handed out to children at school. They were told not to look at them, but for many it was simply too easy to view as they were only sealed with a small sticker . Her mom however is concerned about what . these kind of letters do for the self-esteem of ‘other girls who don't . have the same support at home.’ Williams visited her the school principal on Thursday. ‘She was sympathetic, but said the kids weren’t supposed to open it. My response is, they’re kids. How can you believe they’re not going to open it?’ Williams said. ‘It’s a very positive thing for some kids who are overweight, but we shouldn’t be putting these assessments in the children’s hands,’ the mom added. The principal told Williams that they will consider sending the Fitnessgrams home next year in a sealed envelope with the report cards. Gwendolyn is in the third grade at PS 29 Bardwell, pictured.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A Samoan woman who acknowledged killing her newborn son at a Washington convent where she was studying to become a nun was sentenced Friday to four years in prison. Sosefina Amoa, 26, has said she didn't know she was pregnant before she gave birth to a baby boy in her room at the Little Sisters of the Poor convent in Washington in early October. Amoa had arrived in the United States from Samoa less than a week before delivering the child. She acknowledged as part of a plea deal in February that after giving birth to her son she put a piece of wool clothing over his nose and mouth and applied pressure, smothering him. On Friday, prosecutor Cynthia Wright praised Amoa's 'generosity of spirit' for wanting to help others and become a nun, but she said Amoa also initially lied, claiming she had found the dead child outside, before acknowledging the boy was hers and had been born alive. A nun from the Little Sisters of the Poor convent in Washingtong DC is seen leaving court on Friday following the sentencing of nun-in-training Sosefina Amoa, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter for suffocating her infant son . 'The hard truth is that she consciously killed her son,' Wright said in asking for a five-year sentence. Wright held up a larger-than life photo of the infant and asked that the courtroom remain silent for two minutes, the same amount of time that Amoa has acknowledged having her hand over the child's mouth. Amoa's attorney, Judith Pipe, called the request ""theatrics,"" but the judge allowed the court to pause. In response, Pipe argued that Amoa would never have come to the United States if she knew she was pregnant and was 'panicked' and 'terrified' after giving birth. Pipe said Amoa loves children and never intended to hurt her baby. She has said previously that Amoa didn't mean to kill the boy, only to quiet him so she could figure out what to do. Pipe asked that Amoa not spend any more time in jail and instead be deported immediately to her native Samoa. Or, she said, a sentence of less than a year was appropriate. The 26-year-old had only been in the U.S. for five days when she gave birth to the baby boy she named Joseph at the Little Sister of the Poor convent in Washington last October, but said she did not realize she was pregnant . 'This is a woman who will be punished for the rest of her days no matter what the court's judgment is,' she said. Amoa cried throughout much of the hearing. At one point she addressed the judge, her voice breaking repeatedly, telling him she was 'shocked' when she gave birth to her son, whom she named Joseph. 'I was not able to think straight,' Amoa said and asked for forgiveness. Judge Robert Morin called the case a 'tremendous tragedy' and said he believed Amoa was in denial about her pregnancy and shocked when she gave birth. Morin said Amoa had led a good life before hurting her child and he believes she is committed to leading a good life again. 'I hope you do heal,' he told her. Two Little Sisters of the Poor nuns attended Friday's hearing but declined to comment.","Sosefina Amoa gave birth in her room at the Little Sisters of the Poor convent in Washington, D.C. on October 10 .

"By . Alex Greig . A Phoenix teenager is facing charges after a child he was babysitting was injured last weekend and later died. Justin Hoskins, 16, is behind bars and being charged as an adult after the five-year-old he was caring for, Ian Blair, was rushed to hospital with severe brain injuries before dying. Police say the teen originally was arrested Sunday on suspicion of child abuse and may face further charges following the child's death on Wednesday. Teen babysitter: Justin Hoskins was looking after five-year-old Ian Blair and two other small children when he became enraged and shoved the boy so hard he died later of his injuries . Police were called Sunday night to Phoenix Children's Hospital after the victim's mother says she found her son unresponsive in bed after she got home from work. The child was airlifted to the hospital in extremely critical condition. According to AZ Family, the mother of five-year-old Ian, his three-year-old sister and four-month-old brother, left the children in the care of Hoskins, the son of her live-in boyfriend, a frequent occurrence in the household in which both parents worked full-time. Ian and his sister got in a food fight on the afternoon of May 18, and Hoskins allegedly became angry with the child and sent him to stand in the corner as punishment. When he refused, Hoskins shoved the boy in the chest so hard that his head buckled back, he lost his balance and he fell over, hitting his head on the ground, according to police. Little boy lost: Ian Blair's mother thought her son was napping but realized something was terribly wrong when she couldn't wake him for dinner . Court records show that instead of calling for help, Hoskins picked up the unresponsive boy and carried him to his bedroom. He noticed the boy had vomited on himself, but put him in his bed anyway and left him there. Hoskins's father came home from work and saw that the smaller children were napping and he too took a nap. Ian Blair's mother came home and looked in on the sleeping children. Seeing nothing out of the ordinary, she too took a nap. At least five hours passed before Ian Blair's mother went to wake the child for dinner and noticed something was terribly wrong. Quiet street: Neighbors were shocked to see the home of Ian Blair and his family turned into a crime scene Wednesday . Immature: Looking after three very young children proved too much for Justin Hoskins, with a violent and tragic outcome for little Ian Blair . She found him covered in vomit and urine and couldn't wake him. According to court documents, Ian was suffering from 'extreme hematoma to the right side of the brain, bilateral retinal hemorrhages, swelling in the eyes and face,' and bruising on his body, reports AZ Family. He was bleeding from his eyes. Ian Blair was placed on life support and kept alive long enough for his family to say their final goodbyes. Hoskins gave three different versions of what happened to the child, first claiming ignorance, then blaming the family dog for knocking the boy down and finally admitting to shoving the little boy. The teen was taken to the Maricopa County Juvenile Detention Center and is facing child abuse charges but could face additional charges now that the little boy is dead.","Justin Hoskins, 16, is facing charges in the death of five-year-old Ian Blair .

"By . Lydia Warren . Police have issued a warrant for the arrest of Denver Broncos' safety T.J. Ward after he allegedly got into a fight with staff at a Denver strip club earlier this month. The scuffle ensued after the 27-year-old, who signed with the team just two months ago, brought alcohol into PT's All Nude after he thought the establishment had allowed him to do so, the Denver Post reported. But once inside, he was questioned by wait staff and a confrontation ensued - with Ward allegedly throwing an object at a female bartender, sources told 9News. Sought: T.J. Ward, who plays for the Denver Broncos, is being sought by police following a bar scuffle . Police, who have been investigating the incident for more than a week, have issued an arrest warrant for Ward on suspicion of . misdemeanor assault and disturbing the peace. When quizzed about the incident, Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson simply called it 'some type of disturbance at a nightclub'. Authorities have been working with Ward and are waiting for him to surrender, Jackson said. The NFL will monitor the situation and the team said they were also aware of it. 'We have been aware of this issue and will continue to review all of the facts,' the Broncos said in a team statement on Thursday. 'Charges: Police have issued an arrest warrant for the 27-year-old, pictured on Instagram, on suspicion of misdemeanor assault and disturbing the peace following the confrontation earlier this month . NFL commissioner Roger Goodell can discipline players regardless of the outcome of their legal issues, but the Post reported that it's unlikely he would be suspended for a misdemeanor. It's not his first time his name has made headlines for his alleged antics off the field. He was also reportedly in a fight outside a Los Angeles nightclub two years ago, but he was not arrested in connection with the case. Ward was signed to the Broncos just two months ago after free agency opened in March. He was one of three free agents signed by the Broncos as they made over their defense after their 43-8 loss to Seattle in the Super Bowl.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Twitter bosses have announced that their social networking site will block posts in Pakistan deemed to contain 'blasphemous' or 'unethical' material. Abdul Batin, from Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority, sent five requests to Twitter per day after messages appeared containing pictures of the Prophet Muhammad and links to anti-Islam blogs. It is the first time the social network has agreed to block content in Pakistan, though it has previously agreed to block content in other countries, including neo-Nazi tweets in Germany. Twitter has agreed to ban certain posts in Pakistan after a complaint from the country's internet watchdog . According to a report in the New York Times, among the blocked messages will be crude drawings of the Prophet Muhammad, photographs of burning Korans, messages from a handful of anti-Islam bloggers and an American porn star. However, some have argued that the move is unnecessary as the Pakistan IT regulator already has a page allowing users to report blasphemous content. The company has a country-specific filtering policy, meaning the tweets each user sees can be modified on a country-by-country basis. Among the outlawed tweets are pictures of the Prophet Mohammad, images of burning Korans, messages from an America porn star and links to anti-Islam blogs . Earlier this week the site blocked tweets from an ultranationalist Ukrainian group to stop them being seen in Russia. Critics accused the company, which has previously trumpeted its commitments to free speech, as further adding to censorship in a country where it is already rife. However, Twitter has argued that blocking specific posts is preferable to having the whole site taken down.","Social media site agrees to block 'blasphemous' tweets in Pakistan .

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greig . Two upstate New York radio hosts have been fired over their on-air comments about the city of Rochester's decision to cover gender reassignment surgery for city employees. Entercom Rochester on Thursday announced the firings of Kimberly Ray and Barry Beck from WBZA, calling their comments 'hateful' and saying they don't represent the station. Buzz off: Barry Beck and Kimberley Ray have been fired as hosts of The Breakfast Buzz morning show for their remarks regarding transgender people . 'The services that will be paid for under the new coverage: gender reassignment surgery, psychological counseling, because you're probably a nut job to begin with,' Ray said on Wednesday morning's show. The two also played the Aerosmith song . 'Dude Looks Like a Lady' and likened gender non-conforming issues to a . woman who wants a 'boob job' for her mental health, and mocked a female . listener who called to complain, saying, 'Thank you, sir.' The discussion on their Breakfast Buzz show Wednesday had generated 4,500 signatures by Friday on a removal petition. Phone numbers for the two were unlisted and they couldn't be reached for comment Thursday. The pair were initially suspended, but one day later the station took the decision to fire them, effective immediately. 'Their . hateful comments against the transgender community do not represent our . station or our company,' The Buzz said in a statement Thursday morning. 'We deeply apologize to the transgender community, the community of Rochester and anyone else who was offended by their comments. We are proud of our past work on behalf of the local LGBT community and we remain committed to that partnership.' Swift justice: After Wednesday's show the pair were suspended, but just a day later their employer fired them from their positions following national attention and a Change.org petition that garnered 4,500 signatures . Digging a deeper hole, Ray took to Twitter to defend herself, posting 'Freedom of Speech includes the freedom to offend others. You aren't granted a right to not be offended in this life #getoverit#ROC,' on a now-defunct Twitter account. A Facebook post for 98.9 The Buzz yesterday announcing the pair's dismissal garnered 2,178 likes. 'The 1st amendment protects you from the government.

"By . Associated Press . Deputy Chief William Roseman told reporters that the knife-wielding man was attacking a woman when the good Samaritan stepped in to help late Thursday and was stabbed. 'Officers attempted to talk to the offender and tried to have him drop the knife,' Roseman said. 'As officers tried to deescalate the situation, the male offender began to advance on the officers.' Police officers near the shooting of a knife-wielding man Thursday in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The man attacked a good Samaritan who intervened when the man was attacking a woman . Police cordon off an area in Albuquerque near where officers shot a knife-wielding man. The deadly shooting is third by the force since 2010 . Roseman said two officers shot and killed the man after he continued to move toward police. The name of the suspect was not released. Officials also have not released the names of the officers who fired their weapons. In addition, police did not say how many times the man was shot nor if lapel camera footage of the shooting was available. Roseman said the good Samaritan is in critical condition, while the woman has been treated and released. It is the third fatal shooting by the Albuquerque Police Department since the U.S. Justice Department released a scathing review of the agency's use of force and the 40th police shooting since 2010. The report also faulted Albuquerque police for officers' interaction with suspects who have mental illness and how the police SWAT team resolved conflicts. The city has entered negotiations with the Justice Department over reforms and it could take months before the two sides outline an agreement. Riot police stand guard near a crowd protesting police shootings in Albuquerque on March 30. In recent weeks, critics have stepped up the pressure on Albuquerque police by holding street protests and crowding City Council meetings to demand immediate reforms. Earlier this month, angry demonstrators took over the regularly scheduled City Council meeting, chanting for the ouster of the Albuquerque Police Chief Gorden Ede, shouting at Council members and causing so much disruption that the panel's president adjourned the meeting. Protesters tried to serve a 'people's arrest warrant' on Chief Gorden Eden and then held a mock council meeting in the chambers. Demonstrators were removed from the next meeting by police when some approached the podium and refused to speak to protest new Council rule changes on speech. This week, councilors approved a measure that would require that future police chiefs hired by the city get confirmed by the Council. The measure now goes before city voters in a referendum. Critics say they are planning a June protest march.","Police say unidentified man was attacking a woman when the good Samaritan stepped in .

"By . Louise Boyle . A mother has revealed her humiliation after she was told to cover up while breastfeeding her baby on a Delta Airlines flight. Casey Yu was traveling from Atlanta to Tallahassee on Flight 2655 this weekend after attending a family funeral in Connecticut. She said that after a long day of traveling, she settled into her seat to feed her hungry and sleepy son. The mother said she unlatched her bra strap and fed her son with minimum exposure to other passengers. Scroll down for video . Casey Yu, pictured with her one-year-old son Will, has demanded an apology from Delta Airlines after two members of cabin crew told her to cover up while breastfeeding on a flight this weekend . She was quickly approached by a female flight attendant who gave Ms Yu a blanket to cover herself and her one-year-old son Will. Ms Yu told WTXL: 'I asked what it was for because I didn’t . ask for a blanket and she said it was ''for you to cover up while you’re . nursing.'' I said I don’t need that, thank you. She said ''well, we’re . getting complaints about this.''' The mother, who has two other children, said this is the first time she has ever been reprimanded for breastfeeding. A second flight attendant, who Ms Yu described as 'really aggressive' then ordered her to cover up. She responded that it was within her rights to breastfeed her baby. The mother also added that it was late at night and no one was sitting next to her, so she was unsure who allegedly complained. Ms Yu, pictured with her son Will, was breastfeeding her son after a long day of traveling home from a family funeral when she was asked to cover up by Delta flight crew . The mother-of-three posted an account of her ordeal on Twitter after being ordered not to breastfeed on a flight by Delta flight attendants . Ms Yu vented her anger at the situation on social media where she was met with resounding support. She tweeted: 'Hey @Delta @DeltaNewsroom @DeltaAssist on flight 2655 to TLH and 2 flight attendants told me to cover up while nursing my baby. NOT. OK.' She later posted: 'My baby and I decide when to nurse. MY BODY, not yours.' When the flight landed, Ms Yu asked to see a supervisor. The Captain joined the discussion and apologized, Ms Yu said. She said that the flight attendant then changed her story and denied saying there had been a complaint. Ms Yu tweeted: 'I have never been so disrespected before in my life. Male FA said I was showing people (WHO??) my entire front side. #feedwill' Dozens of people offered their support to Ms Yu. ‏@maryblau responded: '@caseyyu I'm incensed on your behalf. That's absurd.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Wait: Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos was due to hear the verdict today on her assault charge but will now have to wait until at least July 2 . Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos must wait more than a month to discover the outcome of her trial over claims she assaulted a celebrity blogger. The singer arrived at court today to hear the verdict on claims she left writer Savvas Morgan with a swollen eye. But following a legal argument, District Judge Angus adjourned the case so that further witnesses can be called. One of the outstanding issues surrounds the existence of a 'lost' photograph of Mr Morgan’s injuries allegedly inflicted by the ex-N-Dubz singer at V-Festival in Essex last August. There will now be no verdict until at least July 2 when the case will resume. Judge Hamilton said: 'I am anxious this does not go on any longer than necessary.' During the trial, Contostavlos, who pleaded not guilty to assault, said she was disappointed 'a playground slanging match' had reached court and was keen for it to be resolved adding: 'This is my life on the line.' She has claimed she did not attack him and has been the . victim of a vendetta, saying Mr Morgan had a 'strange obsession' with . her. The star is on trial at Chelmsford . Magistrates’ Court with her assistant, Gareth Varey, who is accused of . threatening behaviour, which he also denies. Earlier today Contostavlos’ tour manager, Drew Lyall, said he had put an arm around her after witnessing the aftermath of the incident which happened in a backstage area. Mr Lyall, who told the court he had assisted Contostavlos on hundreds of occasions, added: 'She was very upset and briefly mentioned it was a guy who had been hounding her or harassing her for a very long period. The singer denies leaving writer Savvas Morgan with a swollen eye at V-Festival in Essex last year . 'She hadn’t mentioned any particular individual before the incident, I had never seen him before. 'She was calm. She was just a little bit upset.' Other . celebrities, including singer and rapper Misha B, Sugababes singer . Mutya Buena, singer Alexandra Burke and rapper Wretch 32, all witnessed . the incident but have not given evidence. Contostavlos . told the court that Mr Morgan had conducted a 'vendetta' against her . since an incident in which she asked security to remove him from a VIP . area at the Whisky Mist nightclub in London’s Mayfair. She also outlined her suspicions that Mr Morgan was involved in the release of a sex tape of her online. Tulisa arriving at Chelmsford Magistrate's Court before a legal dispute led to the case being adjourned . But she claimed she had no grudge against him, saying: 'He was one of many.' Mr Morgan told the court that Contostavlos raised her fists in the air and was swinging her arms in a backstage area at the festival. 'Everyone was jumping around trying to get at me, there was a lot going on,' he said. Prosecutor Matthew McNiff said the incident happened at 12.30am on August 18 as Mr Morgan was about to leave. He said Contostavlos accused Mr Morgan of stalking her, and swore at him. Contostavlos and Varey, 28, both of Royal Drive, Friern Barnet, north London, are both on unconditional bail.

"By . Lydia Warren . Police have admitted they are baffled by the disappearance of a University of Cincinnati student who vanished five days ago when he went outside to retrieve his dropped cell phone. Brogan Dulle, 21, has not been seen since about 2am on Sunday after returning to his Clifton Heights apartment block following a night out with friends. Surveillance footage shows the group of friends heading down the road before the group jumps into a car to go to a Taco Bell, while Dulle heads into the apartment block. But moments later - leaving behind his jacket and phone and leaving his keys still in the door - he returns to the sidewalk with a flashlight to look for his cell phone, police believe. Scroll down for video . Where is Brogan? Brogan Dulle vanished on Sunday after a night out with friends and police have said they have no leads. His parents, Beth and Tom (pictured), said they had no idea why he would disappear . The footage, which was taken from a nearby home, shows him wandering slowly along the road with the light before he walks out of the view of the camera. Dulle hasn't been seen since and officials have admitted that they have no idea where he is. Cincinnati Police Lt. Col. James Whalen said at a press conference that the department is stumped. 'We are basically into our . fifth full day here that Brogan's been missing and we've exhausted most of . the leads we can find,' Whalen said. 'I don't know any more about where he is today . than when I first found out about this Monday evening.' Last sighting: He was captured on surveillance footage walking near his apartment block on Sunday . Mystery: Police believe he had left his apartment to look for his cell phone along the route he had just walked . 'It's . unusual that we don’t get a phone call. Somebody saw something,' he added, but stressed that they had no evidence of foul play. He added that friends said Dulle gave no indication that he had any thoughts to leave the area, and he did not have a car, WLWT reported. Whalen released the video to help the search for Dulle and called it 'our most valuable piece of evidence' so far. He thanked the resident for the video and the media for spreading the word. Dulle's parents said on Friday that they first felt concerned about their dependable son's whereabouts when they learned he'd missed swim class on Sunday and work on Monday. 'Brogan, we love you and miss you terribly,' his mother, Beth Dulle, said in the press conference. 'We're worried sick about . you. We need you home. Nothing is more important than . you being home with us.' Massive search: Laura Lewis, spokesperson for the Dulle family, adjusts a sign near the university campus.

"By . Jill Reilly . Jared Remy has made his first court appearance in seven months, cutting a slimmer figure than when he was arrested for allegedly stabbing his girlfriend to death . Jared Remy has made his first court appearance in seven months, cutting a slimmer figure than when he was arrested for allegedly stabbing his girlfriend to death last year. The 35-year-old son of legendary Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy has not left jail for Middlesex Superior Court since entering a not-guilty plea in October on a first-degree murder charge in the death of his girlfriend Jennifer Martel, 27. During three brief hearings since last fall, Remy’s lawyer had waived his appearance. But a bearded Remy returned to court on Thursday for a hearing related to potential evidence in the case only to have Judge Kathe Tuttman advise him that his lawyer and prosecutors had asked to discuss some motions in the judge’s chambers without his presence - he did not object. An hour . later, Tuttman and the lawyers returned to the courtroom, and the judge . suspended the hearing. It is scheduled to resume Tuesday morning. The tri . Remy . still faces arraignment on assault charges next month in Cambridge . District Court for his alleged beatdown of another inmate at the . Cambridge Jail, reported the Boston Herald. In addition, the Middlesex . District Attorney’s Office is investigating him for assaulting a . correction officer with a milk carton. Earlier this week Jennifer's parents . spoke out for the first time to reveal that she was planning to escape . her boyfriend just days before he allegedly stabbed her to death. Patty . and Brian Martel said they saw Remy becoming increasingly controlling . of their daughter - demanding she take naps, dictating what time she was . allowed to cook him dinner and calling her dozens of times throughout . the day. During three brief hearings since last fall, Remy¿s lawyer had waived his appearance. But a bearded Remy returned to court on Thursday for a hearing related to potential evidence in the case . Tragic: Mr and Mrs Martel said they said a pattern of increasing control that Jared Remy (left) put on their daughter Jennifer, 27, (right) through the years . For . years, they say, Jennifer rebuffed their suggestions that she should . leave the relationship. She said her daughter, Arianna needed her . father. And she always seemed to see the good side of the Remy. The Martels spoke to the Boston Globe - their first time ever speaking out about their daughter who was brutally attacked on the front lawn of her home in Waltham, Massaschusetts, on August 15, 2013 - just three days after Remy was arrested for battery for allegedly slamming her into a mirror in a fit of rage. On Monday August 12, Mrs Martel said she talked to her daughter her the phone. After six years in an abusive relationship, Jennifer had finally had enough. 'She said, ""Mom, don’t worry; I’m planning my escape,""' Mrs Martel told the Globe. Mr and Mrs Martel said they always knew Remy was controlling. They said they could see him wearing down their 'effervescent' daughter - but they never knew how dangerous he could be. 'She used to always tell me, ""Jared, he’s got a big bark, but he’ll calm down,""' Mrs Martel said. 'We don’t come from violence. We didn’t recognize domestic violence. We just thought he was a jerk,' Mr Martel told the Globe. His wife added: 'It’s so clear to us now.' 'Mom, don’t worry; I’m planning my escape.' -Jennifer Martel, three days before she was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend Jared Remy . In February 2013, Mrs Martel - who lived in Virginia with her husband, her son Brian Jr and his wife and kids - drove to Massachusetts to visit her daughter. What she saw there upset her. Remy, an alleged steroid abuser, called her 'trailer trash' and blew up at her over the smell of the cigarettes she smoked on the couple's patio. One day, he declared that it was 'nap time' for Jennifer, Mrs Martel and little Arianna and made them lay down in a dark room for several hours. When they were allowed to come out, he wouldn't let Jennifer cook dinner until he was ready to eat. Mrs Martel said Remy became jealous any time Jennifer left the house without him - except for her work time and his scheduled visited to the gym. She said she cut the visit to her daughter two days short when Remy became enraged with Jennifer. He called her 17 times in a row. By the time she picked up, she broke down in tears in a Kmart as Remy screamed at her. Jennifer told her mother she had to leave - that her presence was agitating her boyfriend. Jennifer, 27, had finally had enough and was planning to leave when Remy allegedly stabbed her to death on the front lawn of their Massachusetts home, her parents say . Jared Remy's father, Jerry Remy, is a Boston sports legend and still works as a Red Sox broadcaster . Mrs Martel says she begged her daughter to take Arianna and come back to Virginia with her. According to the Globe, Mrs Martel exchanged several tragic text messages with her daughter that day. 'I need to see [if] I can get him help first. I talk with his family to see what we can do. he is Ariannas father and I need to do this for her,' Jennifer wrote. Her mother replied: 'I just want you to be happy you don’t deserve this Arianna loves him but as she [gets] older she going to see what he really is... Sometimes you can’t change someone like that ... He has a bad control on you.' Jennifer said: 'I not going to let him control me. I have help here. jareds parents wants what is best for Arianna and they know jared is a mess.' Later, she added: 'I cant handle another blowout like the other day. i am emotional exhausted.' The . next day, her brother, Brian Martel Jr. text Jennifer and said he would . rent a UHaul and move her out of her home with Remy if she wanted. Again, Jennifer refused. Brian . and his wife got custody of Arianna after a lengthy court battle with . Remy's father, Boston sports legend Jerry Remy. She will be raised with . her cousins. However, Jerry Remy and his wife have visitation rights. Jared Remy has pleaded not guilty to murder charges and denied he killed Jennifer.

Carol Coronado, 30, was found in bed with the bloody bodies of her children, Sophia, 3, Yazmine, 1, and two-month-old Xenia, Tuesday evening near Torrance in Los Angeles County, according to police. She then also tried to kill her mother, it has been revealed. Husband Rodolfo was outside working on his car when the killings occurred.

The accused killer is said by investigators to have then gone at the woman with a knife. 'Oh my God!' Piercey is said to have screamed before wrestling the knife from her crazed daughter's hands, sources told the Daily Breeze. Earlier in the day, he and his sister went back to the couple's home to collect some belongings. He covered his face with a cloth, clearly distraught, as he left the home. Specialist . homicide police are still questioning Carol Coronado and have said . there is no further update to the statement they issued late yesterday . night. She has refused to speak to police or shed light on what led her to allegedly slaughter all three of her children. 'The babies were on the bed,' Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Coleman said.'And not in a haphazard fashion, they were placed on the bed, so how and where they were killed, we're going to have to figure that out.' Investigators were reviewing Coronado's medical records and her service in the military. She joined the Army after high school but only spent a few months in the service before being released due to an injury, Coleman said.

"By . Hugo Gye . The owner of a fairground ride which seriously injured two teenagers when it collapsed in mid-air has been ordered to pay a fine of more than £11,000. Conor Baker and Danny Keogh were celebrating finishing their GCSEs with a trip to the fair in Leicester when their carriage suddenly flipped off the ride. The schoolboys were both badly hurt in the accident in July 2012, with Danny spending four days in intensive care. Scroll down for video . Injured: Danny Keogh, left, and Conor Baker, right were hurt in a fairground accident in July 2012 . Ride: The pair are pictured second left on the ride at a Leicester fairground . The Health and Safety Executive found that the ride had been poorly maintained in the run-up to the incident, and a court has now fined its owner William Roberts £11,620. Mr Roberts insisted that his rides were so safe that he let his own children use them - but it emerged that a customer had previously been electrocuted due to a malfunction on one of his rides. Conor and Danny were both 16 at the time of the accident at Leicester's Abbey Park, which was caught on camera by a horrified bystander. Video footage shows their carriage flip off the 'Mega Bounce Frog' ride, throwing Danny away and hurling Conor into the protective barrier. The ride - which was filled with children - continued to spin as onlookers screamed for it to stop. Falling: The moment the boys' carriage began to disconnect from the ride, throwing them out . Danny was treated in intensive care following extensive surgery for a collapsed lung, broken arm and deep wounds to his side, which required 88 staples. He also needed stitches in his tongue and chin. After his eight-day hospital ordeal, he told the local newspaper that he had feared for his life in the heat of the moment. 'I tried to remain as calm as possible because I thought to myself, 'There's no way I'm going to die on a fairground ride,'' he said. 'It sounds silly, but that thought drove me to try to stay alive.' He added: 'I'm never going to go on another fair ride as long as I live. I know I am lucky to be alive so I am not going to push it.' Conor suffered a broken nose, broken teeth, cuts to his face and a significant blow to the head. Agony: Conor was thrown into the protective barrier, smashing his nose and teeth . Horror: The boys said they thought they might die during the accident two years ago . An investigation by the HSE found that a clip and pin securing the car to its operating arm had fallen out, leading to the accident. Mr Roberts, from Manchester, was fined £6,500 and ordered to pay costs of £5,000 plus a £120 victim surcharge at Leicester Magistrates' Court yesterday after he admitted breaching health and safety regulations. Speaking after the hearing, HSE inspector Neil Ward said: 'The unsafe condition of the ride resulted in very serious injuries to two young men who had gone out to celebrate finishing their GCSE exams. 'The outcome could have been much worse. It was a horrifying and painful experience for Conor and Danny and extremely distressing for their families, friends and members of the public who witnessed the incident. 'The public rightly expects rides to be safe. The safety-critical defects identified on this machine were very troubling. The inconsistencies in the pin ends were obvious and the pins and clips were safety-critical components that should have been thoroughly checked on a daily basis.'","Conor Baker and Danny Keogh, both 16, were thrown from ride in 2012 .

"By . Wills Robinson . Two teenage gang members have been jailed for a total of more than ten years after a 15-year-old schoolboy was repeatedly stabbed for his Beats headphones. James Rawlinson, 18, from Liverpool, knifed the schoolboy repeatedly while his fellow 'Fernhill Gang' member Stephen Martin, 19, stole the victim's headphones, which are worth more than £200. The youngster was making his way to his gradmother's house along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, an area controlled by the 'Lineacre Gang', when he came across three thugs who then called their friends for support. James Rawlinson, 18, left, stabbed the schoolboy multiple times while he was walking along the Leeds-Liverpool canal before Stephen Martin stole his Beats Dr Dre headphones . Nine gang members then surrounded the helpless boy and asked him whether he was associated with their rivals. Martin demanded that he hand over his headphones or he would stab him. He tried to escape but Rawlinson, who was 17 at the time, stabbed him in the chest and back, while another gang member threw a brick which hit him in the face. The boy staggered to his grandmother's house leaving a trail of blood, and was rushed to Alder Hey children's hospital. The helpless youngster was taken to Alder Hay Hospital in Liverpool suffering from a punctured lung . Rawlinson continued to punch the boy until someone shouted that they knew the victim was no longer a member of their rival gang. Simon Driver, prosecuting, said: 'In the months before these events, the south Sefton area was blighted by several incidents of violence involving feuding gangs. Martin admitted robbery and Rawlinson pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent on the second day of their trial at Liverpool Crown Court. 'He did not align himself with either party but had friends in both geographical areas.' Rawlinson was jailed for eight years as a result of the attack in November 2012 and was branded a dangerous offender after carrying out the brutal attack which left the schoolboy with a punctured lung. Sentencing the pair at Liverpool Crown Court, Judge Robert Trevor Jones said: 'The incident overall was very disturbing and shocking indeed' And Martin was sent to a young offenders' institution for two years and three months after stealing the boy's headphones. Judge Robert Trevor Jones said: 'The incident overall was very disturbing and shocking indeed. 'And, I hardly need to add, utterly terrifying for your victim. 'He was just 15, going about his business of visiting family, but was unfortunate enough to walk into an area where both of you - forming part of a gang - felt he had no business being. 'Nine of you against one 15-year-old lad.' The judge also said that Rawlinson represented a danger and added a four-year extended licence to his sentence.","James Rawlinson, 18, carried out 'terrifying attack' on Leeds-Liverpool canal .

"By . Darren Boyle . Senior executives in major British supermarkets regularly ignore food expiry dates, with one even branding the policy as 'ridiculous'. In a major survey of some of the largest food retailers, the heads of Sainsbury's, Morrisons and the Co-op all said they all regularly ignored expiry dates and best-before dates at home, while executives at Tesco, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer all admitted ignoring use-by dates. Dalton Philips, CEO of Morrisons said when at home he subjected food to what he described as a 'smell test' rather than relying on the best-before or use-by date on the package. Morrisons chief executive officer Dalton Philips said he subjected food to a 'smell test' rather than relying on the date contained on the packaging . Supermarkets often heavily discount food just as it is approaching its sell-by date . Mr Dalton said the rules were 'ridiculous' especially concerning some cheeses which got better with age . Speaking to The Times, Mr Dalton said: 'Meat especially... I would smell it. Our date codes in the UK are pretty strict. But good, aged beef is nicer. I am always going over the date on my yoghurts. A sell-by date for lots of cheese is ridiculous - they get better with age. The rule is, smell it.' Mr Dalton's view was supported by Mark Price, managing director at Watroise who admitted often eating fruit, vegetables, cheese, meat as well as sausages and bacon a few days after the use-by date. Supermarket giant Tesco last year admitted throwing away almost 30,000 tonnes of food waste during the first six months of the year. The average household could save in the region of £60 a month by reducing the amount of food they throw away, while Tesco admitted they were forced to dispose of 30,000 tonnes of food waste during the first six months of last year . Families can make great savings if they are willing to look past the sell-by date on food . Government figures this week showed that the average weekly spending on all household food and drinks in 2012 was £29.29 per person, an increase of 4.6 percent on 2011. Food was the largest item of household expenditure for poor households after housing, fuel and power costs. The average family could save £60 a month by reducing the amount of food it throws away, campaign group Love Food Hate Waste said. Mary McGrath, from the charity Foodcycle, told The Times: 'Simpler and more accurate expiry dates would help consumers and supermarket bosses alike. 'We are wasting shocking amounts of perfectly edible food every day. I would have to question what they are doing about food waste.' Best-before dates are intended to advise customers on when a food product may be past its best but still safe to eat, guidance from the Food Standards Agency says. Use-by dates are meant to show when food is no longer fit to eat, while sell-by dates are used in some shops as instructions to staff to help with stock control. Mark Price, managing director of Waitrose admitted eating certain foods a few days after the use-by date .","Average family could save £60 a month by reducing the level of food waste .

"By . Steph Cockroft . The Bank Holiday kicked off with a somewhat soggier start than hoped for, as most parts of the UK woke up to washout weather. Hopes for a sizzling summer weekend all but vanished this morning as torrential rain, thunder and even some hail spread across the country for the start of the three-day weekend. Southern England and Wales saw some of the worst wet weather, while Bournemouth recorded the highest amount of rainfall in the country - which was more than half its monthly average. What rain? Tourists in Cambridge didn't let the washout weather stop . them from enjoying a punt along the River Cam earlier today, as rain . spread across the country for the first day of the Bank Holiday weekend . Downpours swept across the country, spelling woe for hundrerds of . families wanting to celebrate the long weekend in glorious sunshine. The . rain comes at the end of a week which has already seen ferocious . thunderstorms, hail and localised floods across the south of England . Beaches across the country, including Brighton, were deserted and sunbeds remained unused as people chose to stay indoors and avoid the constant downpours . Usually packed with sun worshippers, dog walkers and swimmers, the . beach was virtually empty. In . Bournemouth, another seaside town, 28mm of rain fell - more than half . the town's monthly average . Kelsey and Cerys Smither didn't let the cold wind and rain spoil their . ice creams as they enjoyed a trip to the beach in Southsea, Hampshire. But the rest of the beach - usually packed at any hint of sunshine - was deserted . The town recorded 28mm of rainfall, more than half the 50mm it expects per month. The south west of England, the south and east of Wales, the south of England and parts of the Midlands also had a particularly bad dose of the wet weather. As the rain pelted down, beaches remained virtually empty and usually-packed lidos were deserted. And it seems those trying to enjoy the long weekend will have to contend with some more dismal weather conditions until Monday, with the Met Office warning that 'nowhere will be dry'. Although the rain is expected to clear across many parts of the country later today, forecasters predict more rain tomorrow and Monday, in what they have described as an 'unsettled picture'. Swimmers shunned the outdoor pool at Plymouth Hoe, as the south west, along with the Midlands, Wales and the south east, suffered some of the worst wet weather . Lifeguards at the Peterborough Lido sheltered themselves under giant golf umbrellas as they watched a handful of determined swimmers brave the wet weather . The grey start this morning remained in place for most of the day, although forecasters predict the rain will clear in the south of the country later this evening - before it returns again tomorrow . Weather experts said rain . is due to ease off in the south and south east of England later this evening but that heavy . rainfall would continue in the north of England and Scotland. Scattered showers will then stick around all day tomorrow, leaving much of the country in weather limbo. But forecasters say there will be some sunshine on Monday, with above-average temperatures . predicted across the country. East Anglia, which is expected to be the hottest . part of the country, is due to bask in 21C temperatures, while the south coast - particularly Devon and Cornwall - will also have some sunshine. Shoppers in Cambridge propped open their brollies as they braved the bad . weather, which forecasters say is due to continue over the weekend. Although Sunday and Monday is not expected to be as bad as today, forecasters warned 'nowhere would be dry' The Met Office said it was an 'unsettled story' for the rest of the . weekend, with longer periods of rain due throughout next week . But that sunshine could still be dispersed with bouts of rainy weather. Jay Merrell from the Met Office said: 'There has been rain across most parts of the country today. It is not a very nice day at all. 'And there is now a slightly more pessismistic outlook on the weather for the rest of the weekend. 'The rain is due to ease off later today, particularly in the south and south east, but there is nowhere that can expect to be dry tomorrow. 'Unfortunately it is an unsettled story for the next few days, with longer periods of rain expected into next week.' The wet weather should not come as a surprise, after last week’s short-lived heatwave was extinguished by storms on Thursday. Temperatures up to 26C (79F) were replaced by thunder, lightning and an inch of rain, causing road chaos.","The three-day Bank Holiday weekend kicked off with heavy rain, lightening and thunderstorms across the country .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Workers at baking giant Warburtons orchestrated an elaborate scam to steal 60 lorry loads of bread baskets so they could recycle the plastic and pocket £500,000. Paul Rogers, Robert Cooper and Paul Matthews plotted to take the trays from the bakery's plant in Darwen, Lancashire, where Rogers and Cooper both worked. Rogers and Cooper then sold the trays to PM Plastics, the firm owned by Matthews, where the plastic was chipped for recycling as part of the cash-making scheme. Paul Rogers, Robert Cooper and Paul Matthews have been jailed for their part in a £500,000 scam to steal more than 60 lorry loads of bread trays from the plant of baking giant Warburtons  in Darwen, Lancashire . The three men have now been jailed for a total of more than ten years, after being convicted at Burnley Crown Court of . conspiracy to steal. Warburtons delivery driver Rogers, 34, from Rochdale, and his supervisor Cooper, 61, from Bolton, were jailed for 42 and 48 months respectively. Matthews, 46, from Darwen, was jailed for 36 months after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing. The court heard how the workers hatched the plan after Warburtons started recycling its own baskets in November 2010 and instead leased baskets from Bakers Basco, a consortium of leading bakers. Rogers, a former soldier and a father of four, and Cooper, a grandfather, arranged to steal £560,000 worth of trays - around 230 tonnes - from the family-owned company. Rogers then took the trays to the recycling plant, making 67 trips there between October 2011 and March 2011. The court heard there was no legitimate reason for the trips to be made but that they had been authorised by Cooper. The trays were then granulated at the recycling plant, where each tonne was valued at around £500. But the plot was unraveled after Bakers Basco became suspicious. The trays were taken from Warburtons before being sold to PM Plastics, where they were chipped for recycling . The company started to notice a major shortage of its new ‘universal basket’ in March 2012. They sent an investigator along to PM plastics, where he saw the baskets and witnessed some being chipped for recycling. When Matthews was arrested, police found 5,340 trays at the site along with a three-tonne bag of chipped plastics, the court was told. Rogers and Cooper were arrested after that, but pleaded not guilty to the charges, blaming each other for the scam. Prosecutor Nicholas Courtney said: 'Mr Rogers accepted he had delivered the baskets to Mr Cooper, but said he was merely obeying Mr Cooper who had told him to do it. 'And when police spoke to Mr Cooper, he said he did not know anything about it and blamed it on Mr Rogers.' Bob Sastry, defending Rogers, said the plot was completely out of character. He said: 'He was well-regarded by his colleagues and this was something which was totally out of character. 'The clang of the prison gates will ring especially loud for someone like him has never been to prison before.' Rogers, of Parkway, Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was jailed for 42 months having been earlier found guilty of one count of conspiracy to steal. Addressing Rogers, Judge Simon Newell said: 'You were in a position of trust, perhaps to a lesser degree than Mr Cooper, but trust nevertheless.' Cooper, 51, of Bolton, was jailed for 48 months while Matthews, 46, of Darwen received a sentence of 36 months.","Paul Rogers, Robert Cooper and Paul Matthews plotted the elaborate scam .

"By . Hugo Gye . Jailed: Nurse Alan Taylor repeatedly molested two of his patients on a psychiatric ward . A nurse has been jailed for 12 years for sexually abusing two vulnerable patients on a psychiatric ward. Alan Taylor, 51, had sex with one woman in her room on the ward, and on another occasion he molested her in a hospital cupboard. A judge told Taylor that he had 'systematically abused his position' of trust towards his victims as he was banned from ever working as a carer again. Taylor abused the two women, now aged 32, between 2005 and 2007 while he was working at a mental health unit in Hertfordshire. He had previously been warned about his behaviour towards patients several years earlier. St Albans Crown Court heard that Taylor several times put paper over the observation window of one woman's room while he had sex with her during his night shift. He also groped her in a nearby patch of woodland, and took her into a cupboard where he got her to touch him. He took the other woman to his own bedroom in the grounds of the hospital and twice had sex with her, as well as molesting her in a courtyard. Taylor, from St Albans, was yesterday found guilty of five counts of sexual activity with a person with a mental disorder, and sentenced to 12 and a half years in prison. He has been banned from working as a carer by the Nursing and Midwivery Council and must register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. Judge Stephen Warner told him: 'You were in a position of trust and responsibility. You systematically abused that position. You took advantage of the most vulnerable members of society for your own sexual gratification.' Detective Constable Kelly Adams, who led the investigation, said: 'Alan Taylor is a despicable man who preyed on one of the most vulnerable groups of young women in society. He was supposed to care for them, but instead took advantage of their situations for his own sexual gratification. 'This case has been one of the most emotionally and mentally taxing cases we have dealt with - not only because of the nature of the offences, but because the victims were extremely vulnerable. 'We hope that the verdicts passed today and sentences given will reflect the severity of Alan Taylor's appalling actions and give hope to victims of sexual offences that justice can and will be done and the perpetrators of such crimes will be dealt with.' Guilty: Taylor was convicted of five sexual offences at St Albans Crown Court, pictured . A spokesman from the Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust said: 'Our thoughts are with the vulnerable women in this appalling case, as well as their families. 'Alan Taylor's actions were completely unacceptable. He betrayed the position of trust he held and we do not tolerate such behaviour.' Adrian Foster of the Crown Prosecution Service added: 'This case involved the sexual assault of women by a care manager. The position of trust held by the care manager, and the vulnerability of the victims at the time of the abuse greatly increases the seriousness of these already grave offences. 'It is only due to the great courage and persistence of the victims that the despicable behaviour of this nurse at the residential hospital has been exposed. 'I would like to pay tribute to the victims and witnesses in this case for their strength and tenacity in coming forward and giving evidence on matters which must still have been extremely distressing years after the events took place.'","Alan Taylor, 51, repeatedly had sex with mentally ill patients on the ward .

"By . Steve Doughty . and Jim Norton . They are meant to provide affordable homes for families who can’t get on the property ladder. But last night a housing association was accused of gazumping its own customers – after hiking the price of their flats by up to 50 per cent before they had even had the chance to move in. Dozens of first-time buyers had paid their deposits and were waiting for the deals to be completed. But they were left high and dry after the state-funded housing association behind the development increased the prices – in some cases, by up to £150,000 – to ‘take advantage’ of spiralling property values. High and dry: Buyers outside the development in Streatham, south London, who faced huge price hikes . Wandle housing group, which rents out thousands of state-subsidised homes, made a U-turn last night and dropped its prices back to the level agreed with its buyers late last year. But critics accused the group, which is meant to help the less well-off to get homes, of trying to play the housing market to boost its income. Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said: ‘This is unfair, sharp practice by the housing association. The would-be buyers put down a deposit in good faith, and have been treated badly by Wandle due to their delays and failure to communicate.’ The association offered a share in 34 homes in the south London suburb of Streatham. Buyers would pay rent but also take out a mortgage to buy a stake in their flats. Wandle has been given £25million of taxpayers’ money in the past two years to help pay for the development. According to its accounts, it holds assets worth nearly half a billion pounds. But last week it raised the prices of the flats steeply – in some cases, by more than 50 per cent in six months. One stake in a flat for which a buyer agreed to pay £267,000 was pushed up to more than £400,000. The conflict came as fears grow over a housing bubble, with property prices soaring across the country . Customers were told of the move by letter. The housing association explained that there were ‘significant changes in the London property market which are beyond our control’. London house prices have risen by 17 per cent in the past year, with the average price of a home in the capital now £459,000. The flats were meant to be affordable housing and those who were offered them qualified under the association’s rules as people deserving of state help. The buyers put down £500 deposits in December and were told the deals on their flats would be completed in March. However last week they received the letters, explaining that the terms of their agreements had been altered. One buyer of a two-bedroom flat was told her £245,000 stake was now going to cost £355,000. Another couple who agreed to pay £267,000 found that the price had become £417,000. 'This is unfair, sharp practice. The would-be buyers who put down a deposit in good faith have been treated badly' - Housing Minister Kris Hopkins . On average the increases amounted to £55,000 for a one-bedroom flat and £115,000 for a two-bedroom unit. Sales analyst Guy Morris, 44, saw the £260,000 price he had agreed for a half share of a flat  increase to £383,000. He told London’s Evening Standard that the housing association ‘behaved like mercenaries’. He added: ‘Wandle is taking advantage of the house price boom. I don’t know how else to explain it. They have seen an opportunity to get as much money out of us as possible.’ The price increases came after delays at the development which means that flats will not be ready for occupation until the end of the summer. Yesterday morning Wandle, whose chief executive Sara Thakkar earns around £150,000 a year, said it was obliged to boost the prices. ‘Unfortunately external market movement has resulted in substantial increases to the value of these homes in a relatively short period of time,’ said a spokesman. But its policy changed during the day as ministers made their disapproval clear and protests were made to the Greater London Authority. Last night, Wandle apologised to its buyers, saying: ‘We are very sorry for the uncertainty this situation has caused to our prospective purchasers this week.’","State-funded housing association Wandle hiked prices by up to £150,000 .

A couple have been charged with robbing the 71-year-old. Mr Halliday was left with stitches in his gums, cuts to his lip, a bloody head and a bruised side in the alleged attack. George Halliday insists that he will not be frightened into staying in his house despite the alleged attack . The pensioner claimed he required hospital treatment following the incident near his home in Newcastle on Sunday evening . The 71-year-old had his right leg amputated 50 years ago after he developed gangrene . However, the father-of-four said he would not be frightened into staying indoors following the alleged incident. He said: 'I'm tougher than that. Mr Halliday, from Sheildfield, Newcastle said: 'I've been through so much in my lifetime.' Mr Halliday admitted he has had a hard life and hasn't been able to work much since losing his leg . The attack is alleged to have happened on Sunday evening. It is claimed Mr Halliday was pulled from his mobility scooter and punched before he had his cash stolen, along with his mobile phone and prescription medication. He said: 'I had to have stitches in my gum. 'I hit my head off the floor and injured it, I fell on my side and it's sore. My lip was cut outside and inside. When they ran off I scrambled back up on to my scooter and someone rang an ambulance and I was taken to hospital. 'I was there for about four or five hours. It was horrible.' Mr Halliday was taken to North Tyneside General with facial injuries following the incident. Almost 50 years ago Mr Halliday had his right leg amputated from the thigh after suffering gangrene.

"By . Chris Pleasance . A schoolboy who beat leukaemia twice died after contracting a lung infection from dust caused by building work at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. Jamie Cartwright, nine, died after the dust caused him to contract a lung infection, which lead to abscesses and finally a brain haemorrhage. At an inquest today, the hospital was today criticised for failing to protect ‘vulnerable’ patients. Jamie Cartwright, nine, caught a fungal lung infection after breathing in dust from building work. The infection spread through his body, causing brain abscesses and eventually a haemorrage which killed him . Recording a narrative verdict Coroner Louise Hunt said: 'He contracted the infection from building work which was being undertaken near to the ward and outpatients clinic, where he was being treated. 'There was a failure to consult the department where patients were particularly at risk and a failure to undertake a risk assessment or act to minimise the risk. These failures contributed to Jamie’s death.' Aspergillosis is a lung infection caused by spores from the aspergillus fungus. In a healthy person, the spores will be quickly destroyed by the immune system but in someone with weak lungs, or a compromised immune system - such as Jamie - it can spread. Symptoms can range from a cough, which is often occurs in asthma sufferers, to coughing up blood or even death. The most serious kind of Aspergillosis, which usually occurs in patients who have had chemotherapy, is invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This infection can spread through the body to the heart, eyes, lungs and kidneys, where it becomes fatal. Jamie's devastated family issued a statement after the hearing, saying: 'We are pleased with the narrative verdict which acknowledges that the Trust’s failure contributed to Jamie’s death and that the Trust has taken action to improve the system for dealing with building work at the hospital. 'We hope that the steps are far reaching and properly adhered to in order to prevent vulnerable immuno-compromised children from being treated in an unsafe environment in the future.' The inquest heard that the pupil from Little Bloxwich Primary school was diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia in 2006, and went into remission after being given chemotherapy treatment. But he suffered a relapse in December 2012 and in March last year underwent a bone marrow stem cell transplant using his older brother, Aaron, as a donor. Jamie suffered complications and went back to the hospital on a number of occasions in June and July after the building work had started at the Accident and Emergency Department. His mother Vicki Cartwright had said she had noticed dust in corridors but when she raised concerns had been reassured that there was no danger. Dr Jim Grey, a microbiologist at the hospital, said there had been no prior consultation with the oncology department about the works. He said that on a scale of one to 10 the seriousness of the failure to do this was 10. At an inquest today Birmingham Children's Hospital (pictured) was criticised for failing to protect 'vulnerable' patients and has pledged to take action to prevent more deaths . Jamie was found to have the life-threatening Aspergillosis lung infection following a chest X-ray and CT scan and was admitted to intensive care. But despite treatment he died on August 7. After the inquest a spokesperson from Birmingham Children’s Hospital said: 'Everyone at the hospital is devastated by the death of Jamie. 'When any child passes away at our hospital, we always examine their care to see if there is anything we could have done to prevent it. 'In Jamie’s case, we recognise that there is a possibility that he could have been exposed to the aspergillus spores. 'I totally understand why Jamie’s family feel that we let them down, but hope they can take some small comfort from the fact we have taken every step possible to learn from our involvement in Jamie’s care and his tragic death.'","Jamie Cartwright, nine, was first diagnosed with Leukemia in 2006 .

"By . John Hall . A London branch of upmarket estate agent Savills has banned its employees having sex at work because used condoms have been clogging up their toilets. According to a leaked email allegedly sent by a senior member of staff at Savills in Sloane Street, Pimlico Plumbers spent seven hours working out the cause of problems with the branch's toilets. Richard Gutteridge, director of residential houses, sent the memo to about 50 members of staff at the branch, warning them 'obviously such activity should not be taking place in the office'. Blockage: According to a leaked email from a senior member of staff at Savills in Sloane Street (pictured), plumbers spent seven hours working out used condoms had caused the toilet problems . The emergency plumbing work 'cost the office a considerable amount of money', according to Mr Gutteridge's leaked email. He said that after working on the toilets for at least seven hours, the plumbers eventually found a mass of used condoms had caused a blockage in the pipes, preventing them draining properly. 'Obviously such activity should not be taking place in the office,' he said. 'As well as it being extremely inconvenient to have both loos out of order for an entire day, this has now cost the office a considerable amount of money,' Mr Gutteridge added. 'Please can we be considerate to the ancient Sloane Street plumbing going forward,' he went on. Leak: Richard Gutteridge, director of residential houses, sent the memo to about 50 members of staff at the branch, warning them 'obviously such activity should not be taking place in the office' Somewhat inevitably the email to staff was leaked, prompting speculation among staff on social networks about which members of staff may have been involved. The debate led Savills public relations team to contact the Metro to point out that the Sloane Street estate agent actually shares its plumbing system, suggesting its staff may not have been to blame. 'Plumbers were called in on Wednesday to investigate problems with the ladies’ lavatories in Savills Sloane Street office,' the company's head of PR said. 'It was discovered that the main drainage system, which is shared with adjacent buildings, was blocked with debris including condoms,' she added. 'The blockage has been removed and the system is now working,' the spokeswoman said.","Plumbers spend seven hours cleaning blockage at Sloane Street branch .

"By . Hugo Gye . A teacher who slipped on a puddle of water at school was received £23,000 of taxpayers' money in compensation, it was revealed today. West Sussex County Council was forced to pay out nearly a full year's salary after the teacher took them to court arguing that the council was responsible for their injuries. The teacher claimed to have suffered ligament damage in the feet and ankle following the fall. Payout: West Sussex County Council, whose headquarters are pictured, has been forced to pay £23,000 to a teacher claiming to have been injured at work . Although the council attempted to fight the claim, the teacher took them to court and won a judgement in their favour. Details of the claim were revealed in reponse to a Freedom of Information request - but the identity of the teacher cannot be made public because of data protection laws. The compensation payment of £23,000 is higher than the annual starting salary for a teacher, with the average teacher outside London earning around £27,000. West Sussex also paid £18,000 in compensation to someone who was hit in the shoulder by an electric door. The local fire and rescue service was forced to pay £5,000 to an employee who hurt their shoulder while lifting a fence - despite the routine danger which firefighters expose themselves to. The neighbouring council, East Sussex, paid out £54,000 to a worker who tripped on a school step, and £72,000 for a 'playground accident'. Slip: The teacher claimed to have sustained ligament damage from falling in a puddle (file photo) Brigthon's city council has also fallen prey to large compensation claims in the past few years. One worker who claimed to have developed tinnitus thanks to a high-pitched alarm was awarded £5,000. Another person claimed £4,685 after a CCTV monitor fell from a desk onto their foot. A spokesman for West Sussex council insisted that the authority does not automatically agree to hand out large compensation payments to anyone who complains. 'The county council examines the merits of all claims and, where they are large, does so in consultation with its insurers,' he siad. 'Where a claim is fully supported by evidence then a settlement will be considered so as to save incurring costs of unnecessary litigation. Where that is not the case the matter will be resisted. 'Claims, however small, are never paid out unless they are supported by strong evidence that the council has been negligent. 'As a large employer and an organisation with many buildings to operate, the county council will be on the receiving end of claims resulting from accidents at work.'","West Sussex County Council forced to pay out nearly a year's salary .

"By . Darren Boyle . A talented gymnast died after suffering 'incredibly rare' blood clots brought on by a combination of Crohn's disease and a contraceptive pill she was taking. Katie Davies died on Boxing Day 2012, four days after being admitted to Wigan Infirmary. The 21-year-old Business student thought she was suffering from norovirus shortly before she was rushed to hospital. Katie Davies thought she was only suffering from Norovirus when she was admitted to Wigan Infirmary on December 22, 2012 . Boton Coroner's court heard that Ms Davies, from Appley Bridge, Lancs had been suffering from Crohn's disease and had earlier refused surgical treatment for the painful inflammatory bowel condition. Instead, Ms Davies opted for a series of injections. The inquest heard that business student was admitted to Wigan Infirmary on December 22, 2012 after complaining of severe headaches and vomiting. Scans performed at the hospital discovered that she was suffering from thrombosis and was prescribed anti-coagulation medication. Medics decided that she should also be kept under observation. However, her condition continued to deteriorate and she died in the early hours of Boxing Day. The inquest heard that Ms Davies suffered from Crohn's disease and took the oral contraceptive pill which increased the chance of her suffering a blood clot . Area Coroner for Manchester West, Alan . Walsh, found Katie's death by a cerebral thrombosis arose from a . combination of her condition and an oral contraceptive she was taking, . which combined can increase the risk of blood clotting. Professor David Sanders, from the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, told the inquest there was an increased risk of clotting from the combination of Crohn’s disease and the medication she was taking, but for the clots to develop in the brain from such circumstances was incredibly rare. Deborah Davies told the five-day inquest that her daughter had been looking forward to Christmas before falling ill and refused to let her illness inhibit her love of life. Ms Davies said: 'She was very glamorous and loved make-up and concerts, there was no keeping her down. She was also a British standard gymnast. 'When she was diagnosed with Crohn’s she was horrified at the thought of the surgery, and she was so keen to try the alternative treatment as it would give her a better quality of life. 'Just before Christmas she said she was too tired to take her brother to the cinema, and that worried us as it just wasn’t Katie. She went to the Trafford Centre and I was told she had been taken to hospital, but she thought it was norovirus and said not to worry.' The inquest heard that the hospital was extremely busy in Christmas Day with up to 30 patients on each of the unit's five wards. Just three doctors were responsible for the patients. Dr Zinnarah Zainodin told the inquest she visited Ms Davies twice during the day to carry out a full neurological examination, being unable to do so the first time due to the amount of pain she was in. However, Dr Zainodin also admitted not fully checking which drugs she was being given. The court heard how subsequent reviews led to the identification of failings in care, although these did not contribute directly to Ms Davies' death. Coroner Alan Walsh at Bolton Coroner's Court found that Ms Davies, pictured, died from a cerebral thrombosis . The problems identified in treating Ms Davies included the quality of both medical and nursing care and staff knowledge of the seriousness of her condition. Mr Walsh said he would write to Health Minister Jeremy Hunt about guidelines for treating thrombosis patients and the bleeper system used to call doctors, as this repeatedly failed to bring aid to Katie. The inquest heard patients suffering from conditions such as Ms Davies' were no longer treated at Wigan but were directly transferred to the regional centre at Salford Royal Hospital for specialist care. Bolton Coroner's court heard that in the 24 hours before she died there were at least 30 patients on each of Wigan Infirmary's five wards (pictured), covered by just three doctors . Mr Walsh said: 'Katie’s death was such a shock to the hospitals that actions have been taken and Wigan’s changes are ongoing. 'I’m grateful to Salford Royal, as doctors there have devised new guidance for the treatment of patients with this kind of thrombosis. 'I am extremely concerned these are not being followed in some areas, and I will request a review of the policy nationwide.' Mr Walsh added: 'Katie was an attractive, vibrant young lady who was on the verge of an academic qualification and who had everything to live for. 'She was very close to her boyfriend and had a supportive family. She was clearly bright and intelligent, and everything in her life was there to look forward to in the future. I am greatly saddened Katie is no longer with us and with her family.' Speaking after her daughter's inquest Mrs Davies said: 'The hospital have really gone out of their way to admit what went wrong and lots of things have now been changed. 'The only thing I can never forget is that Katie died alone and I wasn't able to hold her hand, because I would never have left her side.' Coroner Alan Walsh said he was going to write to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured, asking him to urgently review the guidelines for treating patients suffering from thrombosis .","Katie Davies was being treated for Crohn's disease at the time of her death .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman dodged two speeding tickets by claiming her husband was driving, even though he had been dead for a year. Former business owner Catherine Goodwin, 60, got away with the deception until she applied for a passport in her husband’s name and sent with it a photo of a man she met in Spain. Civil servants became concerned and alerted police who found Goodwin’s husband Alan had died in 2007. Jailed: Catherine Goodwin was handed a six-month jail term after claiming her dead husband was driving the car on both occasions when she was caught for speeding . But Derby Crown Court was told he had two speeding fines recorded against him in 2008 and six penalty points had been put on his driving licence. Details of the speeding incidents were sent to her home in Ilkeston, Derbyshire and she replied saying her husband was the driver and paid the £60 fines. Alex Wolfson, prosecuting, said: 'The DVLA didn’t realise he had passed away until these matters were drawn to their attention. 'Somewhat bizarrely and for no apparent reason, this defendant later made an application for a British passport in the name of her late husband, who passed away in 2007.' The first application was made in 2011 but was returned to her. She then made a second one, again in the name of her late husband, and included the photograph of a man who has never been identified. She admitted two counts of perverting the course of justice and two of making fraudulent applications to get a passport. Steve Gosnell, in mitigation, said she had no penalty points on her licence and so did not risk a ban because of the speeding tickets. He said: 'There would be an increase in insurance but this is clearly not the situation where somebody has nine points and gets a partner, grandfather or uncle to take the points so they avoid disqualification.' She was 'primary carer' for her husband, who had cancer. When he died, she suffered from depression and discovered he was in debt. That resulted in 'loan sharks' chasing her, Mr Gosnell said. Judge Ebrahim Mooncey told Goodwin her actions were 'callous', 'attacking the very fabric of the justice system' 'There were debts with legitimate companies and loan sharks were also coming out of the woodwork. Her husband had passed away and she had no one to turn to,' he added. 'She was not thinking clearly, not thinking as she would normally. She was not aware of the seriousness of what she has done.' The court heard Goodwin used to own a printing business and was a trained bookkeeper. After being widowed, she lived in Spain and was ordered by debt collectors to produce her husband’s passport. She used a photograph of a man she met in Spain. Mr Gosnell said: 'She signed it to say it was a likeness of her husband. There is no sophistication. She gave her phone number and e-mail.' Passing sentence Judge Ebrahim Mooncey told Goodwin: 'It sounds quite callous what you did. Perverting justice is attacking the very fabric of the justice system.'","Alan Goodwin had two speeding fines against him in 2008. He died in 2007 .

"By . Richard Spillett . A former Taliban fighter serving four life sentences for trying to recruit home-grown terrorists to kill British soldiers can keep his family home, a court has ruled. In a legal first, police tried to confiscate Munir Farooqi's four-bedroom home after he turned the property in Manchester into a 'production centre' for extremist propaganda. But in a landmark High Court ruling, senior law lord Sir Richard Henriques QC refused to make the order because of the effect it would have on Farooqi's 'wholly innocent' family. A judge has ruled Munir Farooqi (left) can keep the Manchester home he used to recruit terrorists (right) The judge found that the family home, which once contained a collection of 50,000 extremist books, DVDs and CDs, cannot be forfeited to pay Farooqi's £400,000 in legal aid costs and £100,000 in prosecution costs. The case is believed to be the first ever bid to seize the home of a convicted terrorist using new laws under Section 23A of the Terrorism Act 2000. Farooqi . had argued that the family home and the two rented properties were not . owned by him and were in the names of other family members including his . wife Zeenat and daughter Zulaikha. His family said it would be unfair to confiscate the their home, which houses three generations. They . also said the two other properties are the main source of income and the . livelihood for the families and confiscation of those would be a 'gross . injustice'. Father-of-three Farooqi was at the centre of a plot to radicalise and persuade vulnerable young men to 'fight, kill and die' in a jihad in Afghanistan, his trial in 2011 heard. The judge ruled Farooqi's family were 'wholly innocent' and should not have to move out . Farooqi was inspired to head to Afghanistan by the allied invasion which followed the 9/11 terror attacks. He joined the Taliban as an 'active terrorist' but was captured and jailed in November 2001. But by May 2002 he was released by the authorities in Pakistan and headed back to Manchester. The father-of-three ran a Dawah, Islamic book stall, on Longsight market in Manchester to spread the word of Islam. Farooqi's operation was 'sophisticated, ruthless and well honed', the judge said, with him dedicating his life to the recruitment of men willing to fight abroad in the name of extremist Islam. His son, . Harris, was cleared by the jury in the same trial as his father of a . single count of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism. But after Farooqi's conviction, his son and other family living at the property fought the authorities' attempts to get a forfeiture order for the house. Farooqi's family say they cannot live in one of his two other properties, which have been divided into flats and provide them with income . Farooqi owns two other houses in Manchester, which are rented out, with those assets worth £510,000 in all. But, in . his ruling today, judge Sir Richard said that the two other houses were . 'unsuitable' to rehouse the family if the main home was forfeited as . they are divided into flats. However, the judge did order that Farooqi should be liable for the legal costs of bringing the trial. Pakistani-born . British citizen Farooqi, was captured in a police sting when two . undercover anti-terrorism police officers infiltrated his group wearing . secret bugging devices. He had bragged to the officers how he had fought with the Taliban and told them they could become 'martyrs' for the cause. Under . Clause 23a of the Terrorism Act 2000 a convicted terrorist can have . their assets seized by the state under a forfeiture order. The . Farooqi family were informed of the Crown Prosecution Service's . Proceeds of Crime Unit's intention to seize the house at the end of . Munir Farooqi's trial. The courts found Farooqi attempted to radicalise men and recruit them for jihad at the house. But the judge ordered the seizure proceedings to take place after the outcome of Farooqi's appeal. His outraged family say they are entitled to a private and family life and will use the Human Rights Act to fight the move. Their . solicitor Simon Pook said the act had been misinterpreted and would be . in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights if it created case . law. The CPS has said the . power to forfeit residential premises in these circumstances is a new . power under the Counter Terrorism Act 2008. He also found 'amusement' in the sight of the flag-draped coffins of fallen allied troops returning from Afghanistan. Farooqi . was given four life sentences and told he must serve a minimum of nine . years before he can be considered for parole after being convicted of . preparing for acts of terrorism, three counts of soliciting to murder . and one count of dissemination of terrorist publications, following a . four month trial at Manchester Crown Court in 2011. The forfeiture proceedings had been brought by the North West Counter Terrorism Unit (NWCTU) and the Crown Prosecution Service. Outside . court today, Detective Superintendent Julian Richardson said: 'Munir Farooqi . was convicted and sentenced in 2011 of preparation for terrorist acts . overseas, three counts of soliciting to murder and dissemination of . terrorist publications and given four life sentences. 'All of the offences took place at Victoria Terrace, Longsight, Manchester, which is the Farooqi family home. 'The ruling by Sir Richard Henriques demonstrates a proportionate response to the evidence placed before the court. 'The . Crown agreed that the ruling give due consideration to those . 'interested parties' so that no innocent party was unduly punished or . made homeless as a result of this hearing. 'The . £500k costs order should draw to a conclusion this protracted and . complex investigation into the most serious offences that threatened the . lives of coalition Forces overseas. 'Munir . Farooqi threatened to kill 40-50 military personnel when planning his . attacks. The ruling provides some redress to the state for the . significant cost to the public purse and hopefully acts as a deterrent . to those considering terrorist acts.'","Munir Farooqi turned home in Manchester into a factory of extremist material .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . 'Dream job': Megan Cox, 22, had her position as an Emirates Airlines air hostess taken away in light of her medical history . A British woman had her dream job as an air hostess snatched away after her would-be employers realised she used to suffer from depression. Megan Cox, 22, was offered a post with Emirates Airlines last month, and was so set on her life in the skies that she immediately turned down other job opportunities. But this week she had the job offer snatched from her grasp in light of a medical form the company asked her to complete - which revealed that she used to have depression. Miss Cox, who was diagnosed with the condition in 2012, sent a message from her doctor explaining that she had recovered and that there was no reason to be concerned. However, the Dubai-based company withdrew the job offer regardless. Because air hostesses travel across the world for their job, it is not always clear whether they are covered by UK employment law. Miss Cox, of Bridgwater, Somerset, launched a protest page on Facebook called Emirates Against Depression, describing her situation. She wrote: 'In April I . was offered my dream job with Emirates after the incredibly tough open . day and final interview. 'One week after I was offered the job as a cabin crew member, I was given a . ridiculous medical... As . part of the medical, I needed to agree for Emirates to view all of my . medical history. Miss Cox said that filling out the medical form was the final stage in a costly application process that cost her more than £1,000 on fees, administration, travel vaccines and transport. She said: 'I spent over £1,000 during the recruitment process, on necessary . vaccinations, travel, transport and £50 for my doctor's medical . assessment. 'I have suffered twice with depression, once in 2009 and again in 2012, after horrific and traumatic events happened in my life. 'My doctor explained that I had recovered and was no longer on any medication and my depression was caused because of events, and was not a pre-existing condition. Megan said: 'I feel completely discriminated against. I was given every indication that I was going to get the job and to have it snatched away from me like this because of something in the past is so cruel. 'I didn't receive any further feedback about why I had been rejected by Emirates. I don't want anyone else to go through this situation. 'I am only human and I had medication to help me sleep and with my emotions, during a very difficult time in my life. 'Wanted to scream': Miss Cox wrote online of her shock at the withdrawn job, and said Emirates had lost out on the 'perfect' air hostess . 'I think it is terrible I have been discriminated against because of this and I want to help others look out for this'. However, Miss Cox later took Emirates to task for their rejection, which she said had only increased her determination. 'I read horror stories online about them rejecting . people. And today . I received one paragraph stating that my contract has been withdrawn . due to this reason. 'I was hysterical and . wanted to scream. It's heartbreaking losing your dream job. 'But good . riddance, Emirates. I'm a human being, who has been through hell and back . during certain times of my life. I've needed to take a few pills to . help me sleep and bring my mood up. 'Depression made me a stronger, . healthier person and opened my eyes to the world. It's given me life . experience that you couldn't comprehend... I would have been . the perfect air hostess. Turnaround: Dubai-based Emirates airlines withdrew their job offer after receiving the medical form . 'Fair': Dubai-based Emirates Airlines insisted its processes were fair . 'Emirates, . you've just lost one of your strongest, hard-working potential . employees who would have contributed to your company substantially... You will not bring me down. You've just made me even stronger.' Since the rejection Megan has taken up an admin job at Exeter . Hospital, and says she is better off not working for Emirates. She said: 'I'm not where I want to be, but now I know what . the company are like, I'm better off not working for them'. Depression is an illness which causes a person to feel . persistently sad for weeks or months at a time. It can also cause feelings of hopelessness, a loss of interest in life and physical symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite and libido, and aches and pains. Depression can vary in severity - in mild cases it may cause . a person to feel persistently low, while in its most severe form it can cause . people to feel suicidal and as though life if not worth living. The condition can affect up to one in six people, although some experts estimate it affects one in four at some . time in their life – and is thought to be more common in women. There is sometimes a trigger for depression - such as . bereavement - but it can also occur for no obvious reason. Treatment options include talking therapies and . anti-depressant medications. Depression sufferers can also benefit from eating healthily, . exercising and reducing alcohol consumption. Source: NHS Choices . Campaigners last night insisted that having a history of mental health is no reason to be rejected for a job. Marjorie Wallace, the head of mental health charity SANE, said: 'People can recover from depression as they do from any physical illness or injury, therefore it is wrong that they should be discriminated against and considered unfit to work. 'It is estimated that one in four people will experience an episode of depression or similar mental health condition, the vast majority of whom continue to work effectively'. And spokesman for the Time to Change mental health campaigner told  The Independent: 'One in four people experience mental health problems in any year but this doesn’t mean they can’t work and do just as good a job as anyone else'. According to legal experts, withdrawing a job offer on the grounds of past depression can be illegal - provided the court judges the condition to be a 'disability'. Juliette Franklin, an employment solicitor at Slater & Gordon, told MailOnline: ‘In the UK employees who have suffered from health issues in the past . may be protected from discrimination under the Equality Act 2010, if . those health issues meet the test of “disability” under the Act.’ However, Emirates is not a UK-based company and it is legally contentious whether staff such as air hostesses who work all over the world are covered by UK employment law. When confronted about Miss Cox's case, Emirates insisted that its processes were 'fair' but than being part of the cabin crew is a 'demanding' job. A spokesman said: 'Emirates has a clear and fair recruitment process and is an equal opportunity employer... All applications are reviewed closely... for this extremely demanding role. We are unable to comment on individual recruitment cases'.","Megan Cox, 22, was offered her dream job with Emirates Airlines in April .

"By . Rebecca Camber, Crime Reporter . Former firearms officer Steve White took the helm of the Police Federation on a coin toss . For an organisation in turmoil over its hidden cash reserves, it was perhaps an inauspicious way to appoint a new chief. The police leader tasked with shaking up the beleaguered Police Federation was elected after a dead heat in the race to be chairman was settled on the toss of a coin. Just days after the scandal-hit police union was warned that it ‘must change or die’, former firearms officer Steve White took the helm. Previously the organisation’s vice-chairman and an officer with Avon and Somerset Police for more than 25 years, he was voted as chairman despite a 50/50 split in the ranks over his appointment, leading to it being settled by a flip of a coin as dictated by Federation rules. He replaces Steve Williams, who with its general secretary Ian Rennie, dramatically quit days after the Daily Mail revealed the organisation had hired a PR firm to mastermind a ‘guerrilla’ and ‘blitzkrieg’ campaign against the Government in the wake of the Plebgate scandal. The organisation, which represents 126,000 rank-and-file policemen and women, has also come under fire for mercilessly exploiting the September 2012 incident, involving the then chief whip Andrew Mitchell and policemen at the gates of Downing Street. The reverberations of Andrew Mitchell's contretemps with Downing Street policemen is still being felt in the Police Federation and the wider political and legal fields . It has also been rocked by a series of crises over its bullying, obsessive secrecy and funding. Those crises include undisclosed bank accounts containing tens of millions of pounds, vast sums invested in off-shore bank accounts and perks enjoyed by senior officials. This week Theresa May heaped on further woe when she addressed the Federation’s conference in Bournemouth, and announced the removal of state funding this August. She fought the law and the law lost:  Home Secretary Theresa May took on the Police Federation . The Home Secretary was met with stunned silence as she unveiled a package of measures to end automatic enrolment for new officers and allow the public to scrutinise its finances, warning that the body must end its closed shop culture or she would legislate against it. Yesterday Mr White pledged to implement change. He said: ‘This has been an historic week. We have been given a clear mandate to progress the reforms needed to better represent the hard working police officers throughout England and Wales. ‘We are all committed to the work needed to implement change to the Police Federation. ‘This is not the end of the road, it is the start of the journey.’ The Police Federation headquarters in Leatherhead, Surrey .","Former firearms officer Steve White elected new chairman on coin toss .

"By . Wills Robinson . A portrait of Richard III, whose remains will now be laid to rest in Leicester Cathedral following a High Court battle . Richard III will finally be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral after judges said it was time for the monarch to be given a 'dignified burial'. Distant relatives opposed plans to bury him in the city after his remains were discovered in a council car park in August 2012. They said he should be placed in York Minster because it was a wish of 'the last medieval king of England'. But the High Court told the claimaints, who are part of the Plantagenet Alliance, there was no reason to interfere with the initial plans. Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 - ending the Wars of the Roses and the Plantagenet dynasty. His body was taken to Leicester by supporters of the victorious Henry VII and buried in Greyfriars church, now the site of the council car park. The Alliance's counsel Gerard Clarke told the court he would be satisfied if a consultation exercise was launched, and suggested the Queen and royal household should be at the top of the list of consultees. He added the relatives themselves as well as members of the public should be involved because it 'is not just any old bones'. But Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with Mr Justice Ouseley and Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, ruled there were no public law grounds for interfering with the plans for reburial at Leicester Cathedral. The three judges said in a joint ruling: 'Since Richard III’s exhumation on September 5 2012, passions have been roused and much ink has been spilt. 'Issues relating to his life and death and place of re-interment have been exhaustively examined and debated. 'The Very Reverend David Monteith, the Dean of Leicester Cathedral, has explained the considerable efforts and expenditure invested by the cathedral in order to create a lasting burial place 'as befits an anointed King'. The skeleton of Richard III, which was discovered at the Grey Friars excavation site in Leicester . The announcement that the initial plans for the burial will go ahead was made at Leicester Cathedral by (left to right) Richard Buckley OBE, The Very Reverand David Monteith, The Right Reverend Tim Stevens, City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby, Professor Mark Thompson and Nick Rushton, the Leader of Leicester City Council . Location: Richard III will finally be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral after judges said it was time for the monarch to be given a 'dignified burial'. His remains were discovered in a nearby council car park in 2012 . 'We agree that it is time for Richard III to be given a dignified reburial, and finally laid to rest.' It is currently unclear whether or not the Alliance will seek to appeal. Any further matters stemming from the judgment will be dealt with at a later date. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling condemned the Alliance legal action, saying it had 'taken up so much time and money'. Mr Grayling said: 'I have been very clear from the start that the decision to grant an exhumation licence for Richard III was taken correctly and in line with the law. 'I am pleased the court has reached the same conclusion and comprehensively rejected all of the claimant’s arguments. The remains of Richard III as they were discovered by archaeologists in a council car park in Leicester . 'I . am, however, frustrated and angry that the Plantagenet Alliance - a . group with tenuous claims to being relatives of Richard III - have taken . up so much time and public money. 'This case, brought by a shell company . set up by the Alliance to avoid paying legal costs, is an example of . exactly why the Government is bringing forward a package of reforms to . the judicial review process.' There . was applause at Leicester Cathedral as Bishop of Leicester Tim Stevens . read out the result at 10am to a crowd of supporters and media. 'We . are, of course, delighted. Here in the cathedral, in the diocese, in . the city, in the county, we’ve waited a long time for this.' He said plans for the reinterment that had been on hold could now progress. The monarch will be finally laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral after High Court Judges said it was time to give him a 'dignified burial' Distant relatives wanted Richard to be buried at York Minster, claiming it was a dying wish of the last medieval king, who was known as 'Richard of York' Richard was born on in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. Scientists found he had a curved spine and was riddled with roundworm . Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verfied form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year. Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil taken from Richard III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were infected with roundworm during his life.","High Court judges said it is time for monarch to be given 'dignified burial'

"By . Emma Glanfield . The 30-year-old, pictured outside Bristol Magistrates' Court admitted child neglect after leaving her three-year-old son home alone . A reckless mother who left her three-year-old son alone in the house for over an hour was arrested for neglect after the distressed toddler rang 999 and told police: ‘I’m home alone’. The 30-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, later told police she ‘thought he would be safe’ after she left him watching television at their home in Bristol. She was arrested after police responded to the 999 call from the scared youngster, and found him alone wearing just a t-shirt and shorts on a cold day in February. Bristol Magistrates’ Court heard how the incident supposedly came about after the woman lost her keys while the pair dropped her other children at school. She said she realised she had no keys when returning to the property and decided to lift her son through an open window where he could apparently sit with a blanket and watch TV while she went to look for her keys. Richard Nicholls, prosecuting, told Bristol magistrates the boy dialled 999 after becoming upset when he knocked over a pot. He said: ‘He knocked over a pot and it distressed the boy, who cried “mummy”.’ When police arrived at the property, they climbed through the open window and looked after the boy until the mother turned up an hour later. She was found to be carrying a small amount of cannabis when she returned to the home, which had no heating, electricity or food. She was arrested and her son was taken into temporary care with social services. While in custody, the single mother told police she thought the child would be safe on his own as he would have just watched TV and said she had woken that morning to find no bread and only sour milk for her children’s breakfast. An investigation which followed established she had also failed to send her other children to primary school on numerous occasions. Richard Clark, for Bristol City Council, said they had poor attendance records and the mother had a conviction from 2011 after one child had 69 unauthorised days off school. The 30-year-old single mother pleaded guilty to neglecting a child, two charges of knowingly not sending a child to school and possession of cannabis when she appeared at Bristol Magistrates' Court (pictured) Judy Hampton, defending, said the . woman had been the victim of domestic violence and was a single mother . struggling to establish a good morning routine with her children. She said she was ‘extremely remorseful’ and added: ‘She is accepting help and working in the right direction.’ The mother pleaded guilty to neglecting a child, two charges of knowingly not sending a child to school and possession of cannabis. She was given a 12-week suspended prison sentence, with two years of supervision, and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £80.","Mother left three-year-old son home alone after losing her keys in February .

"By . Wills Robinson . Callum William Moody-Chapman, 17, walked into the sea and drowned after being trolled by a boy who began dating his ex-girlfriend . A teenager walked into the sea and drowned himself after receiving violent threats on Facebook from a boy who had been dating his ex-girlfriend, an inquest has heard. Callum William Moody-Chapman, 17, was found dead on a beach in Maryport, Cumbria, last December after he was trolled by a thug who said he would stab him, beat him up and set his family's house on fire. The 17-year-old abuser, who cannot be named, had been a friend but the relationship turned sour when he headbutted Callum to the ground during a row over the girl. During the vicious exchange, which began a month before Callum's death, the boy wrote: 'I swear to God, shut your lips or I'll cut them off and feed them to you. He added: 'I'm going to carry on giving you beatings until I can't be bothered anymore.' Callum tried to calm the situation by saying: 'Why do you always have to resolve stuff with violence?' But the abuse continued. The inquest in Cockermouth, Cumbria, heard that the youngster, who lived in Grimbsy, had been decorating his aunt's house when he disappeared. After receiving threats on the morning of his death, Callum phoned his brother Robert in tears and apologised for messing up his life and that of those around him. He added: 'I have to phone dad and tell him I love him. Give Poppy a kiss from me.' Describing the phone call, his father Kevin Chapman said: 'All I can remember is at the end of it he said, ""Maryport pier looks lovely from here"". Then he said, ""dad"" and I said ‘What’s the matter?’ and he said ""I love you"".' Callum had initially arrived in Maryport to visit his grandmother Sandra Chapman on December 6 with Kevin, Robert, Robert’s partner Jemma and baby Poppy. When the others went home three days later, Callum asked his aunt if he could stay, offering to do decorating for her. Robert Chapman said: 'I believe Callum chose to stay in Maryport to avoid trouble.' Callum seemed okay during the week he had stayed with his aunt but was upset on the night of December 14 after having a phone conversation with the girl, the hearing was told. His body was found on a beach in Maryport, Cumbria, two days after he went missing from his aunt's house . When he heard Callum was missing, the thug sent messages that said: 'I have no contacts in your area. Please tell him I won’t hurt him.' The 17-year-old has since admitted assault and an offence under the Malicious Communication Act and was given an eight-month referral order. On the morning of his death, Callum rang his brother and father in tears and apologised for 'messing up' their lives . His mother, Nichola Moody, told The Daily Mirror: 'Callum would be alive today had it not been for his abuser.' Paying tribute to her son, she added: 'If anybody needed help he’d be the first one there. He had the biggest, bluest eyes and he just won you over.' Kevin Chapman said: 'I used to call him the class clown. He was just a happy-go-lucky cheeky chappy. 'It’s devastated us. We don’t wish this on anybody. 'You don’t think you’re going to go through it.' Coroner Simon Ward said it was commendable that he had not retaliated, either to the boy’s headbutt or to the Facebook threats. Concluding that Callum had killed himself, Mr Ward added: 'It’s clear to me that Callum was being harassed. 'It’s all too easy with social media these days to pursue a campaign like that, sometimes with terrible consequences.' After the inquest, Callum’s parents said they hoped to help launch a campaign about cyber bullying and encouraged anyone affected by it not to suffer in silence. Mr Chapman said: 'If they can’t talk to family members speak to each other of find somebody like Childline. 'f you’re being bullied done take it on your own. 'I just hope the story gets out to people of how bad cyber bullying is becoming. We’ll never ever forget Callum, God love him.' Ms Moody added: 'You don’t want to hear that anybody’s child committed suicide.' After the inquest, Callum's parents Kevin Chapman (left) and Nichola Moody (right) said they wanted to launch a campaign to help prevent online bullying .","Callum William Moody-Chapman, 17, was found dead in Maryport, Cumbria .

"By . Louise Cheer . A photographer captured a pair of unidentified objects apparently hovering near the flight path of a passenger jet as he took pictures of huge storm clouds gathering over Bondi Beach. Photographer Dan Toomey snapped photos of the two objects flying either side of a Virgin passenger jet while taking photos of angry skies off Sydney's coast . Mr Toomey believes they are unidentified flying objects or UFOs. Scroll down for video . Dan Toomey snapped photos of these unidentified flying objects in the sky over Bondi during a storm five years ago . 'When I was taking photos I saw nothing unusual other than a new storm,' he said. 'I uploaded the photos only minutes later on my laptop and I zoomed in and said ""What is this""?' In the series of photographs, taken in 2009, a saucer-like and cigar-shaped object are seen flying either side of a Virgin Blue plane. Over the next few days, Mr Toomey tried to find out what the objects were, but was unsuccessful. 'I tried to experiment to determine whether or not any insects or birds could have produced similar results, which is impossible – I’ve consulted with other photographers,' he said. This photo is part of a series of about nine photos taken consecutively showing two objects flying near a Virgin Blue passenger plane . 'The photographs are authentic and they are objects that cannot be claimed. 'If you invert the photo to a negative, the plane appears white as a solid object and so do the other objects.' But this is not the first time Mr Toomey has spotted an unexplained object. He said he had seen them with his own eyes but had rarely captured them on film. 'It always pays to have a camera handy,' the 38-year-old said. Even though the photos were taken in 2009, Mr Toomey has been holding them close to his chest. In this negative image, the two objects (left and right) appear in white on either side of the plane (centre) indicating they are solid . But with the unexplained disappearance of the Malaysian Airlines flight, he felt it was time to share them. 'There’s a big a question mark next to that plane and a lot of conspiracies surrounding what happened,' Mr Toomey said. 'Maybe it’s the right time for the world to know and that these things are real.' Flight MH370 was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it went missing on March 8. The search for the plane continues off the coast of Australia in the southern Indian Ocean.","Photographer snaps UFOs flying over Bondi while taking photos of a storm .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Walked free: Jason Blackwell, 29, admitted leaving a cerebral palsy sufferer in his care outside in the cold . A care worker who locked a naked man outside in the cold and fed him disgusting meals of salted banana covered in ketchup has been spared jail. Jason Blackwell, 29, admitted abandoning his victim - who suffers from cerebral palsy - out in the cold and feeding him the vile concoction while he worked at The Dell care home in Sudbury, Suffolk. But despite the judge in the case admitting that the offences warranted a prison sentence, he decided that Blackwell shouldn't be jailed - so that he could get another job in a care home. Ipswich Crown Court heard how Blackwell had abused the man - who has not been named but is in his 40s - once in March and again in October last year. He pleaded guilty to two counts of ill treatment, but walked free from court with a suspended prison sentence and instructions to do 250 hours' unpaid work. Blackwell had been working at the care home for five years when the two incidents occurred. The court was told that there was no obvious motive for the crimes, while his defence lawyer described it as 'a way of getting attention'. Sentencing him, Judge John Holt told Blackwell: 'Your victim suffered from cerebral palsy and was wholly reliant on care and you were employed as one of his carers. 'On one occasion you locked him outside his accommodation on a cold night when he was naked and on the second occasion you poured ketchup and salt on his banana'. Locked out: The victim - a man in his 40s - was a resident at The Dell care home in Sudbury, Suffolk . Judge Holt warned that he could have been sent straight to jail. But he said that as Blackwell had no previous convictions and would not be able to work in care homes again he was prepared to suspend the sentence. Freed: Judge John Holt, pictured, said he was sparing Blackwell from prison because it would stop him working in care . Robert Sadd, prosecuting, said the victim, who was almost totally reliant on the care of others and was unable to speak, lived in a bungalow at the home with several other patients. Mr Sadd said his carer Blackwell had once locked him naked outside on a very cold night. 'We don’t know the motive for this act of cruelty,' he admitted. Mr Sadd said that on another occasion, Blackwell had fed the man, who was very trusting, an 'unpleasant concoction' of salt and ketchup on a banana which 'caused distress'. In a victim impact statement, the victim’s furious mother said she was 'shocked' that something like that could happen and it had made her question her son’s safety. Frances Coles-Harrington, defending, said Blackwell had no previous convictions and had acted completely out of character. She said that in the five years he had worked at the care home there had been no disciplinary matters or complaints against him. Mrs Cole-Harrington said Blackwell had enjoyed his work and felt genuine remorse for his attention-seeking actions. She told the court: 'It wasn’t vengeful or spiteful but an ill-thought out way of getting attention'.","Jason Blackwell, 29, abused resident at The Dell home in Sudbury, Suffolk .

"By . Julian Robinson . Benefits Street star White Dee believes she could become a millionaire by next year and is expected to return for a second trip to Majorca – with a mystery boyfriend. The Department for Work and Pensions has reportedly frozen the reality TV star's £101 a week sickness benefit after she started cashing in on her growing celebrity status. But the Birmingham mother is said to be lining up a number of ways to make more than a million pounds by 2015 through a new autobiography and by appearing on television shows. White Dee, pictured receiving a bouquet of flowers, believes she could become a millionaire by next year as she prepares for a second trip to Majorca - with a mystery boyfriend . The 42-year-old, real name Deirdre Kelly, angered taxpayers recently when she was pictured on a jolly to Magaluf where she was she seen downing pints, shots and champagne. Now it has emerged that she could return to the sun-kissed island, paid for by the organisers of the same Carnage Magaluf pub crawl and pool party she attended. Organisers will also pay for the mother-of-two’s new boyfriend to attend, according to The Sun, which quotes Alan Collinson from Carnage as saying: ‘People who are on benefits should be entitled to go on holiday as well, especially if it’s free.’ Meanwhile, there are also rumours that Miss Kelly is being lined up to appear on Celebrity Big Brother. Her agent, Barry Tomes told The Daily Star that she could become a millionaire – if she can overcome her depression. ‘By Christmas I would estimate she could make about £100,000,’ he is reported as saying. ‘By 2015 she could earn £500,000 if she’s well enough. And she could even become a millionaire.’ He has previously refused to confirm whether her benefits have been cut but accused the DWP of being 'inefficient and ineffective' in dealing with her changing circumstances. The Channel 4 Benefits Street star, real name Deirdre Kelly, angered taxpayers recently when she was pictured on a jolly to Magaluf where she was she seen downing pints, shots and champagne . Mr Tomes said it was possible Miss Kelly's benefits had been cut temporarily due to her income rising from one-off media appearances, but the state payments could resume if her earnings drop again. But he threatened legal action against the government if it emerges the DWP has released any of Ms Kelly's personal details to the media. Miss Kelly, whose handouts equate to the take-home pay of someone earning £20,000 a year, was getting £214 a week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance – formerly known as Sickness Benefit – Child Tax Credit and Child Benefit, plus £500 a month Housing Benefit. But she was recently pictured partying in Magaluf in Majorca and enjoying a steak dinner at a top restaurant. White Dee could return to the sun-kissed island, paid for by the organisers of the same Carnage Magaluf pub crawl and pool party she attended . ‘If people have a problem with how much I am getting, they should speak to David Cameron,’ she said. Her last full-time job was at Birmingham council. She was fired in 2007 – and narrowly avoided a jail sentence – for stealing £13,000. Following the popularity of Benefits Street, which followed the lives of families on James Turner Street in Birmingham, Miss Kelly has had at least six offers to front programmes, including one for a cookery show in France. She has done promotional work abroad, made a rap record and has been DJing at nightclubs in Birmingham. The fortunes of other Benefits stars are not looking as rosy as White Dee's after the show's beloved '50p man' was dropped by a wealthy business partner. Smoggy earned the admiration of thousands when he was filmed selling essentials door-to-door on James Turner Street for just 50p each - and often giving them away to especially needy people. Indeed, the convict-turned-entrepreneur gained so much respect that millionaire Charlie Mullins offers to invest in establishing a permanent 50p shop for him. Dropped: Smoggy earned admiration for selling essentials on James Turner Street at 50p each . However, the enterprise - which was going to be turned into a documentary - has fallen through after Smoggy allegedly demanded a £50,000 fee to take part. Mr Mullins, who founded Pimlico Plumbers and met Smoggy on a Benefits Street-themed TV debate, wrote on his blog that he felt 'completely let down'. He said Smoggy's agent had demanded the cash before he would appear in front of the cameras. Mr Mullins said Smoggy had 'ruined a great opportunity' and warned him about letting 'vampires' influence his life.","Benefits Street star looking to become a millionaire by 2015, agent claims .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A Chinese father-of-four took his own life after he was fined for breaching the country's strict one-child policy. Wang Guangrong, 37, a farmer, had three daughters and a son - a family he was proud of, but which was frowned on by local authorities. Like many poor farmers in Wantun township in southwest China's Guizhou province, he saw the children as an asset and decided to flaunt the policy. Wang Guangrong, 37, (pictured) killed himself after authorities tried to fine him the equivalent of £2,000 to send his four children to school . Like many poor farmers in China's Guizhou province, Wang decided to flout the country's one-child policy, seeing his children as valuable workers . But unlike many of his fellow labourers, Wang also wanted to give the children an education, and it was when he sent his offspring to school that authorities tried to fine him . Unlike the other labourers he was determined to give his children an education, but when he sent them to school in March he was told he had to pay the equivalent of  £2,000 for their classes. Unable to pay the sum, and unwilling to bring his children up without them going to school, he decided to kill himself. 'He couldn't take it,' said his widow Wu Jinmin, 36. 'He said to me before he cut his wrists: ""What did we bring them into the world for, to be as dumb as cattle? I cannot see my children grow up uneducated"".' Unable to pay the fine, and unwilling to let his children grow up uneducated, Wang killed himself . Now officials have paid Wang's wife (left) £2,000 for a new house, and allowed her children to go to school . The family are now in the process of building themselves a new home following Wang's death . His suicide embarrassed local authorities so much they have now paid his widow an estimated £20,000 in compensation and promised to buy her a new house. Jinmin added: 'They said after his death that extra births, although not encouraged, should not stop the children being educated. 'I wish my husband were still with me, but I think he would be happy where he is knowing that our family will be educated after all, even if we are not. 'The children miss him the most. They are all very sad.' Wang's wife says that, on the day her husband killed himself, he asked her 'What did we bring [children] into the world for, to be as dumb as cattle?' Wang's wife says her husband would be happy knowing that his children will get an education .","Like many farmers, Wang Guangrong, 37, decided to flaunt one-child policy .

"By . Chris Pleasance . When night-time security guard Greg Heaslip left a note with his manager asking for time off, he thought the only person to see it would be his supervisor. Instead, Greg's bungling boss forwarded an email request to 3,500 fellow Arcadia employees - the retail giant that manages Topshop, BHS, Miss Selfirdge and Dorothy Perkins. The request went viral yesterday as staff set about trying to '#givegregtheholiday' on Twitter, with one travel company offering him free flights to Las Vegas. But speaking to Mail Online, Mr Heaslip, 38, revealed he will be giving everything to charity and going to Chessington World of Adventures instead. Viral: Greag Heaslip, a security guard, became an internet sensation after his holiday request spawned a Twitter campaign to '#getgregtheholiday' He said: 'I handed in the holiday request on Wednesday, just left a slip of paper on my boss's desk and thought nothing else about it. 'The next I heard of it was yesterday evening at about 5.20pm when I came in for my next shift, I had absolutely no idea.' Despite receiving free flights to Las Vegas, a tuxedo and various other goodies, Mr Heaslip says he will be donating it all to charity and going to Chessington World of Adventures instead . Mr Heaslip, who has worked as a security guard for six years, added: 'I'm still in shock. 'All I wanted was my two days off an now I've got them. I'm going to go to Chessington World of Adventures with my wife Edyta and our 20-month-old daughter. 'I don't want any of the free stuff. I'm going to donate it all to the Stephen Sutton charity so it goes to a good cause.' The viral sensation all started as a joke between Arcadia staff, who began tweeting each other pictures of their clogged email inboxes after the message was accidentally sent out. As staff shared the request, one employee tweeted a picture of her computer which crashed under the weight of emails, while another started a hashtag asking bosses to give Greg his time off. The campaign soon spread to the surrounding offices, with workers opposite the Arcadia building posting messages on their windows in support of Greg. But the message soon spread across the whole of the UK, becoming one of the highest trending topics on Twitter, beating the European elections. It didn't take long for companies to jump on the bandwagon, offering Greg all sorts of supplies for wherever he might end up going, but it was TrekAmerica who stepped forward to offer him free tickets to Las Vegas. It started with an email: Security guard Greg's holiday request went viral online, ending up with him being offered a free holiday . Greg got the holiday: the moment trek America set Greg up with a dream holiday, but he's decided to donate everything he's been given to charity . Holiday outfit: Trek America had a T-shirt made up and will be sending it to Greg in time for his trip . Styling it out: VO5 were also quick to jump on the bandwagon, offering Greg freebies . While Greg relaxed at home, unaware of the whole campaign, other brands followed, offering Greg a holiday wardrobe from BHS and Topman, a VIP shopping session for any female companion from Miss Selfridge and free toiletries from Elemis. And the freebies didn't stop there. After Trek America offered him a free holiday, they even got a T-shirt made up to celebrate the occasion, while VO5 got in on the action, offering hair products and promising: 'What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas'. Inundated: One Arcadia employee tweeted this picture of her email inbox after the request was sent . Where it all began: Arcadia worker Kimberly Jaina appears to be the first person who started the Twitter campaign, resulting in Greg's annual leave becoming one of the highest trending topics . Campaign: The hashtag soon took off, with companies lining up to offer Greg freebies . TrekAmerica eventually dropped Greg an email to let him know about his good fortune. It . read: 'Hi Greg, I hope you’re well and had a nice sleep. I’m sure . you’ve been blissfully unaware of what’s been happening today, but are . now fully up to speed with recent developments regarding your . colleagues’ campaign to #givegregtheholiday. 'Well, we thought it would be nice if you really did get that holiday, so we’re offering you a Mini Adventure around the USA’s west, including flights from the UK to Las Vegas. 'No, this isn’t a joke – we’re really sending you to Vegas! Welcome to Las Vegas: Greg had the last laugh, after he was offered a free trip to the US, but turned it down for a trip to Chessington . Freebie: The security guard would have stayed in Vegas and gone to tour the Grand Canyon and Monument Valley, but has turned the gifts down . 'In case you haven’t heard of TrekAmerica, we offer small group trips around the USA, Canada, Alaska and Central America and have been around for over 40 years. Our ethos is fun and adventure, which is exactly what we think you’ll need after being at the centre of today’s Twitter frenzy!' The letter goes on to outline the trip that Greg will receive - taking in the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, and spending a night in an authentic cowboy camp. He would also have received two nights before and two nights after the trip at a hotel in Las Vegas, but has decided to give all of it away.","Security guard Greg Heaslip requested holiday from work on Wednesday .

"By . Damien Gayle . The death toll of the Nigeria's Islamist insurgency has risen to more than 200 in a single week after 48 people were killed in Boko Haram raids in the country's north-east. Militants stormed three villages near the town of Chibok, Borno State, where Boko Haram snatched nearly 300 girls from their boarding school dorm last month. Hours after a double car bombing killed at least 130 in a central Nigerian city, villagers were forced to bolt into the bush as their homes and possessions were burned and looted. Red cross officials inspect a tricycle at the site of Tuesday's car bomb explosion in Jos, central Nigeria . Rescue workers search for remains at the bomb site. The death toll of the Jos attacks stands at about 130 . People inspect the remains of a car used to carry the bomb. Five wounded victims died overnight . The bombs struck a crowded bus terminal and market, with the second going off half an hour after the first . The attacks came as 80 U.S. Air Force personnel arrived in Chad, which shares a part of its border with Borno state, on a mission to help track down the girls being held captive by Boko Haram. They are helping with intelligence by operating a Predator drone in missions over and around northern Nigeria, the U.S. said. About 40 of the personnel make up the launch and recovering teams for the drone and the other 40 are troops acting as the security force for the team, said Lieutenant Colonel Myles Caggins. Predators are the main type of unmanned aircraft used for drone strikes in Afghanistan and the Pakistani tribal areas, where they are armed with 100lb Hellfire missiles. Although the the U.S. has said that it is being used for reconnaissance, the deployment of such a fearsome weapon seems to mark an escalation in the campaign against Boko Haram. The deployment will be in addition to unarmed Global Hawks already being used in the search, said a senior U.S. official who preferred to remain anonymous. Death from above: A Predator drone of the kind that the U.S. has deployed to Chad to assist Nigerian forces in the continuing search for the nearly 300 schoolgirls snatched by Boko Haram militants last month . During the latest attack on three northeastern villages, which came overnight on Tuesday and early Wednesday, residents who fled to the bush watched while Boko Haram fighters set their thatched-roof mud homes ablaze. 'We saw our village go up in flames as we hid in the bush waiting for the dawn. We lost everything,' Apagu Maidaga of the village of Alagarno told The Associated Press by telephone. The nearby villages of Bulakurbe and Shawa also were attacked. Schools in Nigeria are shut today as teachers hold a day of protests calling for the release of the 276 schoolgirls still being held captive by Boko Haram. Michael Olukoya, president of the Nigerian Union of Teachers, told Nigeria's Premium Times that his members would not stop campaigning 'until our girls are brought back safe and alive and the perpetrators of the heinous crimes are brought to book.' Another union leader, Segun Raheem, said that teachers were also a target of Boko Haram - whose name roughly translates to 'Western education is sinful' - and that authorities must do more to protect them. 'The majority of them are scared. They don't even sleep at home. And when they go to school, it is with shock,' he told BBC News. 'We feel that enough security has not been put in place... and we call on the government... not to play politics with the lives of our children and the teachers.' Agony: Frankly Anderson, a victim of Tuesday's bomb attack, lies wounded at Jos University Teaching Hospital . Victim: Christiana Atongdagama, who lost a limb, receives treatment at Jos University Teaching Hospital . Pain: An unidentified victim sits on a bed with bloodied dressings at Jos University Teaching Hospital . In Jos, central Nigeria, the site of two powerful car bombings in a crowded bus terminal and market on Tuesday, rescue workers with body bags combed the rubble for more bodies. Scores of people gathered at mortuaries and hospitals to search for missing loved ones. Officials reported an additional 12 deaths from the blasts: seven mutilated bodies were recovered from the scene and five of the wounded died in the hospital. Most victims were women and children who worked in the market as vendors, said Mohammed Abdulsalam of the National Emergency Management Agency. 'We expect to find more bodies in the rubble,' he said. Jos was tense with fears that the attack could inflame religious rivalry in the city, which sits on a volatile fault line dividing Nigeria's Muslim north from its Christian south. Fighters: Members of a vigilante group composed of traditional hunters pose for a picture. About 100 traditional hunters from villages in Borno state have gathered in Maiduguri and volunteered to hunt for Boko Haram . Another hunter poses up: The local government gives the vigilantes two meals per day, they say . Looking smart: A vigilante commander. Vigilantes have had some success in the fight back against Boko Haram, with claims they killed dozens of militants and took more captive last week in an ambush . 'Allahu akhbar!' some young men yelled provocatively at an AP photographer near the scene, using the war cry of Islamic militants within earshot of soldiers at a checkpoint. Positive thinking: Brigadier General Olajide Laleye yesterday insisted that victory was close and dismissed reports of low morale among his men . Officials have suggested the extremists are feeding into tribal and religious tensions to spread the insurgency outside of their stronghold in Nigeria's north-east, which was part of an Islamic kingdom before colonisation. Security forces cordoned off the mounds of rubble, burned-out vehicles and obliterated buildings with the debris of panic scattered around — a sandal here, a hat there. Exploded mangoes and pineapples rotted in the sun, their sickly sweet smell mixing with the stench of rotting human flesh. Despite the spiralling bloodshed, Nigerian army spokesman Brigadier General Olajide Laleye yesterday insisted that victory was close. He dismissed reports of troops suffering from low morale and lack of basic equipment, including bullet-proof vests. 'I make bold to say that the Nigerian Army is steadily and surely reversing the ugly menace of terrorism and insurgency in the northeast part of this great nation,' he said at an army recruiting campaign. But extremist attacks have increased in frequency and deadliness, with more than 2,000 people killed so far this year, compared to an estimated 3,600 between 2010 and 2013. On Monday, a car bomb at a bus station killed 24 people in the Christian quarter of the northern Muslim city of Kano, where police later defused another massive car bomb. Two separate bomb blasts in April around another bus station, in the nation's capital of Abuja, killed more than 120 people and wounded more than 200.","Militants stormed three villages near Chibok, where the girls where snatched .

"By . Chris Pleasance . The Italian navy rescued nearly 500 people, including more than 100 children, in an all-night operation yesterday as the immigrants tried to cross from Africa into Europe. The operation began as 133 children along with 74 women were brought aboard two navy vessels Monday evening from two fishing boats tethered together off Sicily. The rescue then had to be suspended due to rough waters, the navy said. The remaining migrants, 281 men, were thrown life preservers and rescued on Tuesday. More than 100 children, including babies, were rescued from the boat. Save the Children have warned that an increasing number of youngster are being sent across unaccompanied . Nearly 500 migrants, more than 133 of them children, have been rescued from a boat in the Mediterranean . The illegal immigrants, most of whom were from Syria, Egypt and Bangladesh, were trying to cross from Africa into Europe along an an infamous route which has seen many killed . Most were from Syria, Egypt and Bangladesh, the navy said. The Save the Children charity has expressed concern about the large number of unaccompanied minors arriving in this year's surge of migrants fleeing conflict and poverty, usually aboard dangerous boats. While most children under 10 who arrive in Italy are with family, many adolescents are traveling alone. Save the Children says there is enough enough space or equipment to house and protect them. There has been an enormous jump this year in the number of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. The Italian Navy stepped in to help as part of operation Mare Nostrum which was set up to save migrants after the Lampedusa disaster which saw 366 people drown . Charity Save the Children expressed concern at the rising number of unaccompanied children on such boats . Of the 26,644 migrants who arrived in Italy through April 30 this year, 3,848 were children and 2,744 of those were unaccompanied. That compares with 3,362 arrivals in the same period last year, including 522 unaccompanied minors and 58 children with families. The U.N. estimates that over 170 people have died at sea trying to reach Europe so far this year. Italy launched patrols of the Mediterranean after several hundred people drown in a single shipwreck off the Italian island of Lampedusa last year. The desperate refugees make the dangerous crossing as they flee famine and war in their home countries . The country has warned that it may allow migrants to travel into northern Europe unless it receives help dealing with an influx of people fleeing war and famine in their home countries. 'We'll just let them go,' he said. 'Since migrants do not want to stay in Italy, they should have the opportunity to exercise their right of political asylum in the rest of Europe. 'Otherwise we transform Italy into the prison of political refugees.'","Nearly 500 illegal immigrants have been rescued from Mediterranean .

"By . Tara Brady . It is alleged that Michael Karkoc was an officer in the SS-led Ukranian Self Defence League and later the SS Galician Division . Germany's highest criminal court has the right to prosecute a 95-year-old man accused of being a notorious Nazi commander who 'burnt villages filled with women and children.' It is alleged that Michael Karkoc was an officer in the SS-led Ukranian Self Defence League and later the SS Galician Division. According to records, he told American authorities in 1949 he had performed no military service during the Second World War and has been living in a quiet Minnesota town. However, an investigation last year revealed the retired carpenter is alleged to have been a former commander in a Nazi SS-led unit. Today the Federal Court of Justice ruled that the 95-year-old's alleged service made him the 'holder of a German office.' This gives Germany the legal right to prosecute him even though he is not German, his alleged crimes were against non-Germans and they were not committed on German soil. Someone in that role 'served the purposes of the Nazi state's world view,' the court said. Karkoc's son, Andriy Karkos, did not respond to an email by the Associated Press seeking comment and hung up on a reporter who reached him via his mobile phone. A home number for Michael Karkoc was no longer working today. The court's decision represents 'a big step forward' in the case against Karkoc, said Thomas Will, deputy director of the special federal prosecutors' office that investigates Nazi crimes. He initially handled the case in Germany. Will referred the case to the court late last year after concluding in his own investigation that enough evidence existed to pursue murder charges against Karkoc, who has denied the allegations against him. The suspected Nazi SS-led military commander has lived quietly in Minneapolis for the past six decades . Will's office has no powers to file charges itself and the federal court in its ruling referred the case to Munich prosecutors. They will examine the evidence again to determine whether to charge Karkoc and seek his extradition from the United States. The German investigation began after the Associated Press published a story last year establishing that Karkoc commanded a unit accused of burning villages filled with women and children, then lied to American immigration officials to get into the United States a few years after the Second World War. This photo of Michael Karkoc was part of his application for German citizenship filed with the Nazi SS-run immigration office on Feb. 14, 1940 . A second story uncovered evidence that Karkoc himself ordered his men in 1944 to attack a Polish village in which dozens of civilians were killed, contradicting statements from his family that he was never at the scene. Polish prosecutors also now are investigating. The U.S. Department of Justice has declined to confirm whether it also is investigating Karkoc, citing its policy of not confirming or denying individual investigations. Karkoc applied for German citizenship on February 14, 1940, according to Nazi documents signed by Karkoc and located by the AP in February in the U.S. National Archives in College Park, Maryland, but he was rejected because of his lack of German language skills. The SS-administered immigration office instead said it would provide Karkoc - who was 20 at the time and whose date of birth and hometown match those on the documents - passport-like papers identifying him as an ethnic German. Last year Mr Karkoc said he 'can't explain' his wartime service despite denying the allegations. Following the war, Karkoc ended up in a camp for displaced people in Neu Ulm, Germany, according to documents obtained from the International Tracing Service in Bad Arolsen, Germany. The documents indicate that his wife died in 1948, a year before he and their two young boys - born in 1945 and 1946 - emigrated to the U.S. After he arrived in Minneapolis, he remarried and had four more children, the last born in 1966. A longtime member of the Ukrainian National Association, Karkoc has been closely involved in community affairs over the past decades and was identified in a 2002 article in a Ukrainian-American publication as a 'longtime UNA activist.' This 1944 photo shows head of the SS Heinrich Himmler, centre, reviewing troops of the Galician SS-Volunteer Infantry Division, of which Michael Karkoc is said to have become a member . The Galician Division and a Ukrainian nationalist organization Karkoc served in were both on a secret American government blacklist of organizations whose members were forbidden from entering the United States at the time. Though records do not show that Karkoc had a direct hand in war crimes, statements from men in his unit and other documentation confirm the Ukrainian company he commanded massacred civilians, and suggest that Karkoc was at the scene of these atrocities as the company leader. Nazi SS files say he and his unit were also involved in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, in which the Nazis brutally suppressed a Polish rebellion against German occupation. The U.S. Department of Justice has used lies about wartime service made in immigration papers to deport dozens of suspected Nazi war criminals. In Germany, Nazis with 'command responsibility' can be charged with war crimes even if their direct involvement in atrocities cannot be proven. Former German army officer Josef Scheungraber - a lieutenant like Karkoc - was convicted in Germany in 2009 on charges of murder based on circumstantial evidence that put him on the scene of a Nazi wartime massacre in Italy as the ranking officer. This is the oath of allegiance on Michael Karkoc's petition for naturalization, signed May 6, 1959 . Karkoc now lives in a modest house in northeast Minneapolis in an area with a significant Ukrainian population. In a background check by U.S. officials on April 14, 1949, Karkoc said he had never performed any military service, telling investigators that he 'worked for father until 1944. Worked in labor camp from 1944 until 1945.' Karkoc, an ethnic Ukrainian, was born in the city of Lutsk in 1919, according to details he provided American officials. At the time, the area was being fought over by Ukraine, Poland and others; it ended up part of Poland until World War II. Several wartime Nazi documents note the same birth date, but say he was born in Horodok, a town in the same region.","Alleged Michael Karkoc was in the SS-led Ukranian Self Defence League .

The park . combines South Korean initiative, capital and technology with cheap . North Korean labor. Meanwhile South Korea have said the building which collapsed last week was home to 92 families and hundreds are feared dead, although the May 13 accident happened in the afternoon and many residents would have been at school or at work.. Apartments in buildings taller than 20 stories are normally reserved for party officials, professionals, academics and managers at state agencies, and those recognised for contribution to the state, the Architecture Institute of (South) Korea said last year. 'They would be the kind of people who the state can't just choose to ignore and act like nothing happened,' a South Korean official with access to intelligence on the North said. They are not the highest ranks of the North's ruling class but they are 'people who have power or money', said Kwak In-su, a North Korean defector who works at the Institute for National Security Strategy, run by the South's spy agency. North Korean officials offered a rare public apology for the collapse of the apartment building under construction in Pyongyang, which a South Korean official said was believed to have caused considerable casualties that could mean hundreds might have died . The collapse follows a period of political upheaval and intrigue and raises questions about the safety of other buildings going up in the same area . 'People have mobile phones and talk,' Kwak said. 'Angry public opinion can become a boomerang so the regime wants to prevent it early.' The collapse follows a period of political upheaval and intrigue and raises questions about the safety of other buildings going up in the same area. Kim, who rose to power when his father died in December 2011, has removed most of Pyongyang's old guard during his comparatively short rule, replacing ageing generals and cadres. He has changed his Korean People's Army chief of staff four times. Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, considered the second most powerful man in North Korea, was executed in December. The scale of Kim's construction projects had puzzled outside analysts as to how the impoverished state was able to supply the materials and equipment needed, and some suggested the North may be doing without, or using fewer, crucial materials like steel. Accidents like last week's collapse 'happen all the time', the South Korean official said, adding only that the location was different. Phyongchon is within walking distance of Kim's office. The word of the collapse in the secretive nation's capital was reported by the North's official Korean Central News Agency, which gave no death toll but said that the accident was 'serious' and upset North Korea's leader . Families of victims of an accident at an apartment construction site in Pyongyang grieve during a gathering in the capital . 'This case is unusual in that unlike most apartment blocks, for working people for example, they would have used better materials ... and followed (safety) standards, and still this happened,' he said. Access to North Korea is severely restricted, but satellite images show the collapsed building as having had balconies. As is the case in South Korea, this is where families would store their kimchi pots through the winter, or put out fake flowers during festivals celebrating the birthdays of the Kim dynasty if facing the road. There are 17 or more high-rise buildings that are new or under construction in the same area, Curtis Melvin, of the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, said. High rise city: The block of flats was under construction but it is believed that many families had moved in before the block was completed . An undercover article published by Asia Press International in 2011 showed pictures of buildings under construction in Pyongyang, reporting a shortage of building materials and food for the workers. One picture showed an apartment block of more than 20 storeys with the location and size of windows changing slightly from floor to floor. Many of the buildings going up also do not have elevators, a Reuters witness said, because of the frequent power outages. 'The collapsed building was neither the first finished nor the most prestigious,' said Melvin, who analyses satellite imagery. 'This raises serious questions about the safety of the other buildings.'","Roman Catholic cardinal from South Korea traveled to North Korea .

"By . Leon Watson . South Korea's navy has fired warning shots after three North Korean patrol boats crossed the maritime border into its territory, it was revealed today. The North Korean boats crossed into the South Korean waters at the Yellow Sea boundary, known as Northern Limit Line, at around 4pm local time on Tuesday. The ships returned to the northern side after a South Korean naval vessel fired ten warning shots, an official with the South Korean Defense Ministry said. Tension: In the latest sign of rising animosity between the bitter rivals, South Korean officials said a North Korean vessel fired two artillery shells at one of its warships patrolling in the Yellow Sea (file image) The NLL is the de facto maritime border, which stretches from the western coast of the peninsula into the Yellow Sea, marking the boundary between the two neighbors. It was set by the United Nations following the Korean War but the North does not recognise it, CNN reported. Incidents have been known to occur on and around the border, including one earlier this year when North and South Korean artillery batteries exchanged hundreds of shells. In 2010, South Korea accused North Korea of using a submarine to torpedo the South Korean ship Cheonan, killing 46 sailors.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Syed Naveed Shabir, 31, has been jailed after stashing 1.6kgs of cocaine inside chessboards . An international drugs smuggler shipped more than £500,000-worth of heroin from Pakistan to Manchester by stashing it inside the lining of chessboards. Syed Naveed Shabir, 31, concealed the drug so well that it could only be extracted when the fabric lining of the boards was ­dissolved with solvent. But officers discovered the heroin - which was 100 per cent pure - after an undercover operation by the National Crime Agency. Shabir has now been jailed for nine years after being found guilty at Manchester Crown Court of drugs smuggling. The court was told how Shabir tried to smuggle 1.6kgs of the Class A drug by tucking it into the lining of ten games boards in a 'sophisticated concealment'. The package, sent in September 2012, also included ludo boards and dried fruit. But Shabir's covert operation was discovered when the package was spotted by the UK Border Force. The court heard the parcel had been addressed to 'Mr S Ahmed' in Oldham, Greater Manchester. Although the name was fake, the address used was real. Once the package had been intercepted, a detective from the National Crime Agency posed as a Parcelforce delivery man so he could drop off the dummy delivery at the house. The pure cocaine had to be extracted from the chess boards using a . solvent process, after Shabir was caught by an undercover officer from the . National Crime Agency . When there was no answer, he left a 'failure to deliver' card at the address with a phone number to call to rearrange the delivery. The number led to a line which had been set up by the NCA for the operation. Shabir's phone was used to call the number and another 'delivery time' was arranged. This time, the parcel was signed for by another man, Khazar Hussain, who signed the sheet as 'Sataroz Ahmed'. But Shabir's fingerprints were later found on the delivery note, the court was told. Hussain was arrested in a nearby street but accused Shabir of setting him up. He was cleared of all charges at the trial. Pete Avery, from the NCA's border policing command, said: 'This was a sophisticated concealment and demonstrates the lengths criminals go to in an effort to avoid detection. 'I have no doubt Shabir would have gone on to import large quantities of pure heroin, but joint work with the Border Force means he is now behind bars where he belongs.'","Syed Naveed Shabir, 31, shipped the package from Pakistan to Manchester .

View  comments . Fighter: Kay Coombes lost her father Peter and brother Paul. Her other brother Steve is one of the missing Cheeki Rafiki yachtsmen . Barely able to sleep and surviving on little more than biscuits, adrenalin and hope, Kay Coombes can’t help but wonder how much more her family – beset by one appalling loss after another – can bear. Her adored father Peter died from a brain aneurism at the age of 49; then in 2008, her brother Paul, 44, died in his sleep after a blood clot travelled to his heart. Two years ago, Kay was diagnosed with breast cancer. Now, just when she thought the worst was behind them, this. Kay’s brother, Steve Warren, 52, is one of four British yachtsmen lost at sea, with hope of finding them alive dwindling by the hour. The US Coastguard said the massive search operation will be called off at 5am today. ‘Right now, it feel as if ours must be the most unlucky family in the world,’ says Kay, 46, a civil servant and divorced mother of one from Bridgwater, Somerset. ‘Our poor mother Margaret is in a terrible state. In the space of six years she’s had to cope with the prospect of losing all three of her children.’ Experienced yachtsman Steve was a crew member on the 40ft yacht Cheeki Rafiki, which was lost just over a week ago after running into difficulties 620 miles east of Massachusetts, while sailing to the UK. The yacht, returning from a regatta in Antigua, began taking on water last Thursday and alerted the authorities at 3.15am local time. At 4.20am, a beacon attached to one of the men’s lifejackets emitted an electronic distress call, followed by another one at 6.57am. Since then there has been no confirmed sighting of the yacht or the men – Steve, his best friend Paul Goslin, 56, James Male, 23, and skipper Andrew Bridge, 22. In the cruellest of ironies, it was the death of his brother and his sister’s battle with cancer that made Steve determined to ‘live for the moment’, seizing the opportunity to join the crew of the Cheeki Rafiki for a ‘trip of a lifetime’. To lose one sibling is devastating enough, but to contemplate losing her other brother has been almost too much for Kay to bear. Tragic: Kay is pictured (centre) with her father Peter who died of a brain aneurism aged just 49. Her brother Paul (left) died at the age of 44 in his sleep from a blood clot in his heart. Steve (right) is now missing at sea . But just as Steve was there for her in times of desperate need, so she summoned up all her reserves to fight for him, rather than give up and accept the worst. She has made it her mission to make sure everything possible has been done to find him. ‘I’m convinced Steve is still alive,’ Kay told me. ‘Even if there’s just a 1 per cent chance of finding him alive, that’s the chance I’m clinging to.’ Kay knows time is running out and with each passing day it becomes harder to hold on to those positive, comforting images of her larger-than-life brother. ‘I have to be realistic. It’s a long . shot, but we need to do everything we can,’ she said. ‘I just don’t want . to think of losing Steve, but if I never see him again, at least I can . know that we did everything in our power to find him.’ Race against time: The US Coast Guard said the search for Steve Warren, 44, will be called off at 5am . The last picture: This is the last image anyone has of the Cheeki Rafiki crew members before they went missing . Kay and her brothers were always close and she and Steve even more so after Paul’s death. She simply cannot imagine life without him. ‘Paul’s death hit the family very hard, because it was so unexpected,’ Kay said. ‘Paul’s death was a wake-up call and completely changed the way Steve looked at life. He was determined to live for the moment and grasp every opportunity.’ Kay added: ‘He was there for me when I needed him and now I have to be there for him. Steve knows I’ll be fighting for him. ‘I’m a fighter. I’ve had breast cancer and I’ve had a double mastectomy. I am a strong woman. ‘Cancer had no chance with me. I’m still here to tell the tale. ‘I need to know that I fought as hard to save Steve’s life too.’","Kay Coombes's brother Steve Warren is one of four sailors lost at sea .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Tragic: John Farrow, 74, died of a heart attack after a drunk mistakenly hammered on his front door for more than hour during the night, a court has heard . A pensioner died of a heart attack after a drunk mistakenly hammered on his front door for more than hour during the night, a court has heard. John Farrow, 74, who used a wheelchair, answered the door to 31-year-old Ben Sisterson after he turned up at his house in Houghton, Cambridgeshire. Minutes later, he was found collapsed and tangled in his wheelchair on the kitchen floor by a neighbour who had heard the commotion. Shockingly, Sisterson then dialled 999 from the house - not to get help from Mr Farrow, but to ask for a lift home. Mr Farrow's wife Jean, 63, finally made it downstairs and the great-grandfather was taken to hospital, where he died five days later. Pathologist Dr Peter Cooper, who conducted a post-mortem examination, said Mr Farrow had suffered from severe lung disease and heart disease, which had been the primary cause of death. However, he added that the pensioner's fatal heart attack had been much more likely caused by stress. Now, Sisterson has walked free from court after being cleared of assault at Sunderland Magistrates' Court in Tyne and Wear. Magistrates said there was not enough proof that there was any deliberate physical contact between the defendant and Mr Farrow for a conviction. The court heard how Sisterson had been . drinking heavily on January 19 this year, before being thrown out of the . home of his friend, Anthony Gaunt, in Houghton. He had then started banging on the doors of nearby neighbours - waking up Mr Gaunt's mother, Christine, in the process. She told the court she had seen Sisterson standing in the yard of the Farrows’ home and had tried to phone the couple to warn them. Scene: Mr Farrow, who used a wheelchair, answered the door to Ben Sisterson, 31, after he turned up at his house (pictured) in Houghton, Cambridgeshire. Minutes later, he was found collapsed on the kitchen floor . But when she received no reply, she went to check on them and found Mr Farrow on the kitchen floor, his legs tangled in his wheelchair. Mrs Farrow, who had been married to the pensioner for 36 years, told the court she and her husband had been first woken at 1am by . banging outside. The widow said Mr Farrow had gone downstairs when it was still going on at 2am, adding: 'Its been very upsetting all the way through. Devastating.' Sisterson, from Coptleigh, Houghton, was arrested inside Mr Farrow’s house and told . police: 'I think I’ve made a serious error going to the wrong house. Incident: The great-grandfather was taken to hospital, where he died five days later. Above, the scene where the incident took place . 'I’m sorry I frightened the old man. I’m extremely concerned. I wouldn’t raise my hand or anything to an old man.' During the trial, magistrates heard a recording of a 999 call Sisterson made on the night, during which he asked for . an ambulance - not to help Mr Farrow, but to give him a lift home . The call ended with him calling the dispatcher a ‘legend’. Toby Hedworth QC, defending, said Sisterson did not give evidence at court . because he was too drunk to remember anything of the incident. He added: 'Nothing this court has heard about his . conduct on that evening or the early hours of that morning reflects any . credit on him. He’s got himself very, very drunk. 'He has . collapsed twice having to be got rid of, banging on people’s doors, . calling emergency services, making a nuisance of himself. 'He clearly was, to anyone he was coming into contact with, a complete pain in the neck. There is no excuse for what he did.' But he said that there was no evidence . that contact - if any - between Sisterson and Mr Farrow was deliberate . rather than accidental. Clearing Sisterson of assault, chairman of the bench Mrs Lindsay said: 'We’ve listened to the evidence of Dr Cooper and noted that the injured . party suffered a cardiac arrest, which could have happened at anytime, . but was more likely to happen in a stressful situation.' But speaking outside court, Mr Farrow's granddaughter Sarah Wallace, 26, said her grandfather 'may well have been frightened to death'. She added: 'He had a terrifying, traumatic death. He will have been scared for his wife who was upstairs.' Case: Now, Sisterson has walked free from court after being cleared of assault at Sunderland Magistrates' Court (pictured).

"By . Paul Donnelley . A woman has been banned from keeping animals for five years after RSPCA inspectors discovered that she had almost 80 rabbits in cramped cages. Julie Cecen, 50, was disqualified after dumping 15 rabbits in woodland near her home and keeping another 78 in cramped cages stacked on top of each other. Cecen, from Barnet, Hertfordshire, was found guilty of six offences under the Animal Welfare Act at Willesden Magistrates Court – including three rabbits that were so malnourished they had convulsions – after her small number of pet rabbits spiralled out of control. The Barnet home of Julie Cecen, 50, showing the state of some of the dozens of rabbits she kept in squalid conditions . District Judge Brennan said in . sentencing: ‘Miss Cecen did not set out to deliberately hurt the . rabbits, but their numbers grew and grew and she was less and less in . control. As a result, two rabbits died.’ The judge found that she failed to meet the needs of 78 rabbits by not providing them with a suitable environment and to meet the needs of 15 rabbits by abandoning them in the nearby woods. Cecen also caused unnecessary suffering to three underweight and infected rabbits. The five-year ban prevents her keeping any animals for five years. In addition, she was given a curfew order with an electronic tag and told to pay £9,000 costs. RSPCA inspector Nicole Broster said: ‘This was a case of rabbits which had overbred with the numbers rapidly spiralling and shows how easily things can get out of control. Three rabbits owned by Julie Cecen were so malnourished that they were suffering from convulsions . For keeping rabbits in conditions like this, Julie Cecen of Barnet was banned from keeping any animals for five years, subjected to a curfew and ordered to pay £9,000 costs . ‘A vet who visited the property said the needs of these rabbits were clearly not being met – they simply did not have a suitable environment and did not have access to their needs. ‘Overcrowded cages were stacked on top of each other and they were not being given a proper diet or provided with enough fresh water.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A maths genius who tried to kill his ex-girlfriend's brother with a speargun as he slept, then stabbed him to death with a carving knife, is today facing life in prison. Cambridge-educated Andrew Morris, 30, was found guilty of murder - despite attempting to convince jurors at the Old Bailey that he was insane. Morris, who earned £120,000 a year as an actuary, was arrogant, narcissistic, looked down on those less clever than him and felt compelled to hurt anybody who crossed him, the court was told. Pictured for the first time: Cambridge-educated Andrew Morris, 30, . was found guilty of murder today - despite attempting to convince jurors at . the Old Bailey that he was insane . He blamed Henry Stangroom, 21, when his sister Michelle broke up with him, moved out of their shared flat, refused to see him and demanded he delete sex tapes they had made. Morris then plotted his elaborate revenge, the court heard, in which he tried to kill the sleeping Mr Stangroom with a single shot to the head. But when the blow failed to kill him and his victim woke up, he stabbed him repeatedly with a kitchen knife then turned the speargun on himself. Victim: Henry Stangroom, 21, shared a flat in Battersea, London with Morris, who shot him with a speargun as he slept and then appeared to try and kill himself . Narcissist: Psychiatrists . who examined Morris (pictured) believe him to be arrogant and selfish . Before the killing, Morris also . killed Ms Stangroom's pet hamster. He filmed himself squeezing the . animal in his fist until its eyes bulged from its head. The . court heard how before the attack Morris had searched the internet for . terms including 'how to kill someone in their sleep', 'horror speargun . accident' and 'sentence for murder in UK'. Psychiatrists . who examined him believe arrogant and selfish Morris may have wanted to . hurt his former partner by murdering the young cook. Ex: The Old Bailey heard how Morris blamed Mr Stangroom for the end of his relationship with Michelle Stangroom, pictured . When . police found Morris lying in the bath 18 hours later he had apparently . attempted to slash his wrists and the harpoon was sticking from his . neck. Morris claimed he acted in self-defence when he was attacked by Mr Stangroom, whom he claimed accused him of stalking his sister. Morris slumped into his chair and started breathing sharply as he was told he would be jailed for life. Ms . Stangroom’s mother and father who have been in court for every day of . the trial, broke down in tears when the jury of six women and five men . delivered the verdict. Judge . Wendy Joseph told the jury ‘emotions in the courtroom have run high’ during the trial, and asked for impact statements from friends and . family of the victim ahead of sentencing. The court heard Morris had a maths degree from Cambridge and his incredible ability with figures allowed him to complete his actuarial exams in three years instead of the normal six. But the court heard that Morris was a narcissist who who was shocked that any woman would reject him. Ruth Owen, a former girlfriend, told how he would ruin her belongings whenever they had an argument. She said he damaged her car, wrecked an oil painting and even snatched a treasured ring from her finger to throw into a river. Morris became a father when he got another girlfriend Laura Teague pregnant, but abandoned her and his son and began his affair with Michelle, whom he met when he was working for finance company Pensions First. They moved into the flat in Battersea in September 2012 and her brother moved in three months later. All three were drug users and took cocaine and nitrous oxide. Morris was also suffering from depression and panic attacks and began taking more and more time off sick. He was working for a company called LCP and was involved in a £200m deal with Goldman Sachs. But by May 2012 he had left work and was living a dissolute lifestyle at home. His erratic behaviour began to extend Ms Stangroom, and he destroyed a pair of Tiffany sunglasses he bought her as punishment for ‘abandoning’ him at a wedding. He later ripped a handbag he had given her in half, smashed an antique lamp that belonged to her grandmother and broke her crutches when she had a foot injury leaving her housebound. Morris also threw her across the room and pinned her down with his hands over her nose and mouth. Ms Stangroom later moved out and said she would not return until he had overcome his issues. The court then heard how Morris turned on Mr Stangroom, blaming him for the end of the relationship, prompting the horrific attack.

Dr Joseph said: ‘When he feels rejected or jealous or his emotional needs are not met, he can respond with petulant, immature or aggressive behaviour.’ He said Morris was sane, but displayed ‘arrogance and narcissism and believes himself to be superior to others.’ After the verdict Morris struggled to stand as he was led from the dock.

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . If you dream of living beside the seaside, you’d better move fast because house prices are soaring. The average price of a home in a seaside town has been rising by nearly £500 a month for the last decade. Some of the most popular resorts have seen house prices double in that time. On average, a home by the sea now costs nearly £200,000, according to Halifax. In places such as exclusive Sandbanks in Dorset and Salcombe in Devon, the average is around £600,000. Craig McKinlay, mortgage director at Halifax, said: ‘Seaside towns provide a unique lifestyle opportunity and remain popular places for people to live. They also attract people looking for second homes or holiday properties which can place additional upward pressure on house prices.’ Salcombe, where the average home costs £615,344, is the most expensive place to live beside the seaside. The town is in Devon’s South Hams district, one of the country’s most popular second home hotspots. It is close to the mouth of the Kingsbridge Estuary, lies within an area of outstanding natural beauty and is loved for its unspoilt beaches and magnificent coastal walks. Exclusive: On average, a home by the sea now costs nearly £200,000, according to Halifax. In places such as exclusive Sandbanks (pictured) in Dorset and Salcombe in Devon, the average price is around £600,000 . Sandbanks, the so-called millionaires’ resort where a tatty bungalow can sell for more than £2million, comes second. Residents include football manager Harry Redknapp whose QPR team could win promotion to the Premier League today. Manager: Residents of Sandbanks include football manager Harry Redknapp whose QPR team could win promotion to the Premier League today . Aldeburgh is the only seaside resort in Suffolk to make it into the top ten most expensive seaside towns. Residents of the picturesque town, whose high street still has traditional sweet shops, recently fought a bitter battle against the opening of a new Tesco. The average seaside home costs £196,826, but many are a fraction of this and Mr McKinlay said: ‘Living near the seaside remains an achievable dream for many.’ To find an affordable place your best chance is to look north. Mr McKinlay said the ten cheapest seaside towns are all below £95,000, including Newbiggin-by-the-Sea in Northumberland (£83,769), Port Bannatyne (£85,605) and Girvan (£85,868). The latter two are in Scotland  which has eight of the ten cheapest seaside places. The annual Halifax report looks at house prices in 196 British seaside towns based on Land Registry and the Registrar of Scotland figures. It comes after an Office for National Statistics report found some English seaside resorts are among the most deprived places in the country, blighted by high unemployment and poor health. The investigation laid bare the crisis facing resorts such as Blackpool, Clacton, Ramsgate and Margate.","Average price of home by sea has been rising by nearly £500 per month .

"By . Daniel Martin . Esther McVey: She said the cash was a personal donation by Henry Angest, not by his company . An employment minister was under fire last night after accepting a £10,000 donation from the head of a controversial high-cost loans company. Esther McVey's constituency party received £10,000 from Henry Angest, boss of the company that owns Everyday Loans. The firm offers personal loans to people with bad credit ratings. It provides unsecured loans at interest rates of up to 80 per cent APR – much higher than the rate available to those whose finances are secure enough for them to borrow from their bank. Critics said it was wrong of the Tory MP for Wirral West to accept the money from a man behind a firm charging vulnerable poor people such high rates. The move is particularly controversial because Miss McVey is a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions, the ministry accused of cutting benefits. Although Everyday Loans charges borrowers up to 80 per cent APR, this is not as much as 'payday lenders' such as Wonga, whose rates can be as high as 4,000 per cent. Everyday Loans does not offer short-term loans designed to last until the next pay day. Its loans are more long term. Mr Angest is chairman and chief executive of Arbuthnot Banking Group, which owns Everyday Loans. Over the past decade, the banker has given the Conservatives £7million in loans and donations. Latest Electoral Commission figures show that in the first quarter of 2014, he gave the party £17,500. Miss McVey, a former presenter on Children's BBC and GMTV, received £10,000 in February. Last night Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, said: 'At the same time as working in a department which is being harsh and ruthless to people with tiny incomes, she is accepting money from someone in charge of a company exploiting the weakness of the most vulnerable. 'No politician should appear to be in hock to any donor, because it gives the impression that any decision taken is influenced by sponsorship.' Miss McVey, pictured in 2001, is a former presenter on Children's BBC and GMTV . Mr Flynn said there should be no need for politician to accept such money anyway, because stringent caps on how much can be spent during election campaigns means large donations are unnecessary. 'The amount they need for campaigning can be raised from jumble sales and raffles,' he said. Miss McVey has a majority of only 2,436. Yesterday she told her local newspaper, the Liverpool Echo: 'This is a bank – and a bank that did not need a bailout from the taxpayer. And the donation came from an individual who is the chief executive officer of the bank, not through any company at all.' Last night a source close to the minister said Mr Angest's company 'fully complies with all the laws and regulations they are subject to'. Everyday Loans has more than 30 branches around the country. Its website says many people on low incomes are 'struggling' because of the Government's failure to put up the minimum wage to £7 an hour. Mr Angest is not the only Tory donor with links to high-cost lenders. Venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft, who has given the Conservatives just under £800,000 in the past seven years, has a major stake in Wonga. A spokesman for Arbuthnot Banking Group said: 'This was a personal donation and is completely above board.'","Esther McVey accepted cash from Everyday Loans owner Henry Angest .

"By . Sam Webb . Edward Davenport, AKA 'Fast Eddie',  was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and jailed for seven years and eight months. He is expected to pay back £12m of the estimated £40m he stole . A self-styled Lord who led the life of an international playboy while masterminding a huge loan swindle may have to repay just a fraction of his £40m   criminal empire, a court heard today. Lord Edward Davenport, 47, has been released from prison after appeal court judges heard he is gravely ill following a kidney transplant. The conman, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, had been jailed for seven and a half years in 2011 but the Court of Appeal recently reduced the term as an 'act of mercy'. Davenport once hosted lavish parties at his £10m mansion and boasted of befriending guests including supermodel Kate Moss and Princes William and Harry. But the socialite, dubbed Fast Eddie, was exposed as a cynical fraudster who duped victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan   schemes. He promised millions of pounds which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments. Princess Diana's wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel was one who fell prey to Davenport's scheme, losing her life savings as a consequence. Davenport and his lieutenants, Peter Riley and Borge Andersen were jailed in 2011 for the scam, which entrapped entrepreneurs from as far afield as   India, Canada and Dubai. The fraudster was not at Southwark Crown Court today for the start of his confiscation hearing.  He may only have to pay back £12m - despite claims he may have made more than £40m through the six-year con. Alex Chalk, prosecuting, said: 'There has been a lot of toing and froing - many, many hours have been spent on both sides seeking to narrow the gap. 'We took the view that it was in the public interest to arrive at the figure of £12m'. He said Davenport should also be forced to pay a further £1.9m in compensation to the 51 victims he swindled between 2003 and 2009. But Andrew Campbell-Tiech, defending, said any compensation should be taken out of the £12m sum ahead of the civil action and heavy prosecution costs   Davenport faces. Fraudster: There were at least 51 victims of the scam, including one who paid £285,000 to arrange a loan of over £150m, but no funds were ever forthcoming . 'Anything Davenport has left over after £12m, anything left would first be the subject of prosecution costs and thereafter, there would be a plethora of   disappointed clients of the former Davenport empire and civil proceedings. 'A plethora of civil litigation swirls round his head'. The court heard Davenport has since been the subject of litigation from HSBC for his criminal dealings, revealed in bank accounts, property, and profit   from his enterprises. He has also auctioned his mansion in plush Portland Place in central London, which he bought from the Sierra Leone government for just £2m. Davenport enticed his victims who a website boasting of his champagne and sports-car lifestyle and a £100m property portfolio in Britain, Thailand and   Monaco. He even lent his 110 room west London mansion for an Agent Provocateur advert featuring Kate Moss, and for scenes in the Oscar-winning movie The King's   Speech. Davenport arriving at Southwark Crown Court during the trial. Davenport had to undergo regular dialysis from December 2012, but remained handcuffed throughout . The court heard that there is still disagreement on Davenport's remaining assets, with the defence estimating the figure at £13.4m and the prosecution   putting it at just over £14m. Mr Chalk said the defence only decided to bring down their figure on Tuesday after they commissioned a new survey on one of Davenport's properties,   valuing it £635,000 below its previous estimate. The two sides had been in agreement over a £14m figure since June last year. Davenport's defence team had previously argued that he should repay as little as £8m, and that his mansion on Portland Place should not be part of   proceedings. Judge Peter Testar said: 'This can't go on. It's three years since the conviction and there have been all sorts of difficulties along the way'. Davenport claimed to be a familiar face in 'exclusive venues across the world' and had 'extensive business interests.' His web page boasted: 'Welcome to the website of Edward Davenport, one of London's most flamboyant and best known entrepreneurs as well as a true   English gentleman from an established British family.' Among the stars Davenport was pictured with on the site's gallery were actors Hugh Grant, Jeremy Irons, Jude Law and Steve Coogan; music mogul Simon   Cowell; rapper 50 Cent, with whom the defendant is shown comparing watches, designers Vivienne Westwood and Jimmy Choo; New Labour spin doctor Alastair   Campbell and current Lord Chancellor Ken Clarke; Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood and other celebrities such as Jordan, Anna Kournikova,   Jean-Claude Van-Damme and Ozzie Osbourne. One of his victims, Miss Emanuel, agreed to surrender 65 per cent of her company in return for a £1.5million investment, but Davenport demanded £20,000   in up-front fees. She told his trial: 'He knew I was at rock bottom and he wanted to screw me out of every penny. 'It was unbelievable that he had made all these contacts and bought a title to give him credibility when he was just a common con man. He fully deserves   his sentence.' Judge Telstar ruled that Davenport's assets stand at £13.9m and that £12m would be confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act. A further ruling on whether Davenport should pay a further £1.9m in compensation to his victims will be made tomorrow. 'I'm not going to make this decision today so I'm going to have to reserve my decision until later,' said Telstar. 'I make the finding, with agreement with both parties and with absolute and entire assurance from those taking instruction, that the benefit to these   crimes was £12m, which will be confiscated. 'I make the further finding that the available sum of assets is £13,943,000'. The court heard that the £12m confiscation order against Davenport would mean his victims may not receive any compensation if they won claims against   him in the High Court. Judge Telstar added: 'When I make my full ruling on whether the defendant should pay a further £1.9m I will examine at whether I can insert a clause so   that victims who win civil litigation against him can have monies from the £12m sum diverted to them'. Davenport, formerly of Portland Place, central London, was convicted after a trial of conspiracy to defraud. The hearing continues.

"A Chicago man convicted in the savage beating of a Northern Irish exchange student, which left her unable to walk or speak, was sentenced to 90 years in prison today. Minutes before Heriberto Viramontes learned his fate Thursday, a prosecutor displayed the bat used to assault exchange student Natasha McShane and her friend Stacy Jurich as they walked home on a spring evening. The 2010 attack left McShane with severe brain damage. Scroll down for video . Vindicated: Heriberto Viramontes (left) was sentenced to 90 years in prison for the April 2010 baseball bat attack on Irish exchange student Natasha McShane (right) and her college friend . The Chicago Sun-Times cites Judge Jorge Alonso saying at Thursday's hearing that hatred and greed motivated the 34-year-old Viramontes. Earlier, Ms Jurich said the evening of the attack had gone from one of joy to her suddenly being on her knees, dripping with blood. 'Their only sin was thinking it was safe to walk four or five blocks in the city of Chicago,' Judge Alonso said of the two victims, according to Chicago Tribune. Before the sentencing, the court heard from McShane's mother, Sheila, who had traveled from Northern Ireland for the occasion. Stacy Jurich also offered her impact statement, and the attacker's family were given a chance to speak as well. Liam and Sheila McShane, parents of beating victim Natasha McShane, walk to the courtroom before Cook County Judge Jorge Alonso sentenced their daughter's attacker, Heriberto Viramontes, to 90-years in prison Thursday . Staying strong: Stacy Jurich, right, walks to the courtroom with her unidentified fiance . Calling Viramontes 'a cowardly, evil being,' Jurich revealed that she still suffers seizures and cannot drive or ride a bike. 'I wish the sounds of the bat breaking my head open would go away, but they never will,' she said from the witness stand. Sheila McShane said her daughter requires around-the-clock care, has speech and physical therapy sessions five days a week and cannot say more than four words at a time. She relies on a picture book featuring images of different objects to communicate. 'She is still alive, but it feels as if we lost her and that's a scar that will never heal,' said Mrs McShane. 'As Natasha's parents, we feel as if we are rearing our 27-year-old daughter all over again.' She added, 'One thing is for certain: Natasha will have a life sentence of her own. A life sentence of pain, misery and unfulfillment,' reported NBC Chicago. When given a chance to say a few words, the defendant expressed hope that his sentencing would start a 'healing process' for the victims and their loved ones. ‘I could never understand the pain that [they] have experienced,’ he said. Update: Sheila McShane said her daughter requires 24-hour care and is forced to rely on a picture book to communicate . Emotional moment: Stacy Jurich broke down saying she still has seizures and cannot get out of her mind the sound of the bat breaking her head . The 35-year-old criminal kept his head bowed for most of the proceedings, but broke down in tears when his sister took the stand talking about their tough family history, and she insisted that her brother was 'not a monster.' Assistant State’s Attorney John Maher argued for a 120-year sentence, telling Judge Alonso that Viramontes 'literally turned Natasha McShane into a ghost.' Mr Viramontes will serve 85 per cent of the sentence, which amounts to about 77 years, behind bars. In the early morning hours of April 23, 2010, Jurich and McShane were walking home in the Bucktown section of Chicago after a night out when a man savagely bludgeoned them as they passed under a viaduct. Miss Jurich needed more than 15 stitches in the back of her head, lost some of her vision and suffers from tremors. Her 23-year-old friend, Miss McShane, was left unable to walk or talk. Survivor: Stacy Jurich stands at the entrance to the viaduct where she and her friend Natasha McShane were brutally attacked in 2010 . Their attacker stole the girls' purses and Miss Jurich remembered thinking that no one would know who they were, just before she lost consciousness. Miss Jurich told the Chicago Tribune that it was while she was still in hospital that she realized she was the only one who could help bring their attacker to justice. A few days after the attack, detectives visited her in the hospital and asked her to identify items they had found. It was perfume and makeup the friends had bought the day before the attack. The sight of their belongings reduced Miss Jurich to tears, but she told the Chicago Tribune it made her think: 'This is on your plate now. You are the only voice.' For the . past four years, Ms Jurich has worked tirelessly with police to ensure . their attacker, Heriberto Viramontes, would be brought to justice. In October, Viramontes was found guilty of . attempted murder, armed robbery and aggravated robber.y . Painful memories: Stacy stands close to where she and Natasha were attacked. Four years after their ordeal she can still recall seeing her friend being smashed to the ground . Brave: Stacy Jurich, center, leaves a courtroom during her attacker's trial last year . Marcy Cruz, a stripper who drove him away from the crime scene, has already been sentenced to 22 years in prison. When she faced Viramontes at the trial last year, Miss Jurich, 28, told the court: 'I had to be the voice because I didn't want this man to hurt anyone else. I wanted to put [Viramontes] away for my best friend, for Natasha.' High profile: The attack that left Natasha, pictured, disabled was used to highlight the increased violence in Chicago . Healing: Four years after the attack Stacy, pictured with her fiance Tim Shannon, is getting her life back on track . On the night she was left disabled for life, Miss McShane had just been offered an internship that would have allowed her to extend her visa in the U.S. Instead, her family flew her back to Northern Ireland, where she struggles to accomplish even the smallest of tasks, like drinking from a cup. Miss Jurich said she is haunted by feelings of guilt. When she got engaged and got a job, she felt sad knowing her friend would never share those experiences. To pay tribute to her friend, and as a reminder of the attack that changed both of their lives forever, Miss Jurich designed a tattoo, featuring two roses to represent the friends, and an Irish cross to represent Miss McShane's home country.","Heriberto Viramontes, 35, said in court he hopes his sentencing will help his victims heal .

"By . Mike Dawes . David Weir produced the fastest wheelchair mile in history — and has been tipped to go faster still by Sir Roger Bannister, a man who knows a thing or two about milestones. Sir Roger was at the top of The Mall in London to present Weir with his medal after he had crossed the line outside Buckingham Palace in 3min 7sec. That was two seconds faster than the time he set on the same route a year ago but short of the three-minute barrier he had targeted to mark the official 60th anniversary of the first sub-four-minute mile run by Sir Roger. Record breaker: David Weir recorded the fastest ever wheelchair mile in Westminster on Saturday . ‘It was wonderful to see him get so close, said Sir Roger. ‘I think he’ll do it next year.’ Weir, who was also cheered on by Mo Farah, duly retained his British Athletics men’s wheelchair road mile title, beating Japan’s Kota Hokinoue by 22 seconds, and vowed to be back next year to launch another attack on the three-minute barrier. ‘I gave it my best shot and I wasn’t too far off,’ said Weir, who clinched the fourth of his quartet of London 2012 Paralympic gold medals when he won the wheelchair marathon on these same streets two years ago. Agonising: Weir broke the world record but just failed to go under the three-minute mark in Westminster . ‘It was such an honour to meet Sir Roger and it would have been great to have broken three minutes in front of him.

The seven-bedroom home, on a private estate in Hersham, Surrey, is available ‘immediately’ through a local estate agent – though any tenant would have to pay £144,000-a-year for the keys to the property. The listing comes just days after the 71-year-old was divorced by his wife of four years, Jo, in a hearing which lasted less than two minutes at a London court. Yours for £12,000-a-month: Disgraced former PR supremo Max Clifford, pictured outside his home before he was imprisoned, has put the mansion on the rental market . Max Clifford's 'beautiful' home, pictured, in Hersham, Surrey, is listed for rent for £12,000-a-month . Clifford, 71, was given an eight-year jail term earlier this month at Southwark Crown Court after being convicted of a string of indecent assaults on four women between 1977 and 1984. Estate Agents Grosvenor Billinghurst have described the ‘beautiful’ home, which features an outdoor swimming pool, as ‘ideal for entertaining with its ample five receptions’. It has five bathrooms and seven bedrooms as well as accommodation for either staff or an au pair. The public relations expert and wife Jo were granted a divorce by a judge sitting in the Central Family Court in London. The listing comes just days after the Max Clifford was divorced by his wife of four years, Jo, in a hearing which lasted less than two minutes at a London court . She split from him on the grounds of ‘unreasonable behaviour’ though neither was at the hearing which lasted just 105 seconds. Three women who were assaulted by jailed Max Clifford have also revealed they are suing the disgraced PR guru, just a day after his wife divorced him. The shamed PR guru’s fortune was estimated at £10million before the huge legal bills from his court case. It has been reported that he took out a £3.5million loan on one of the properties he owns in the run-up to his trial. Clifford also has a house in an exclusive golf development in the hills near Nuevo Andalucia, southern Spain, which he valued at £1.5million in 2008. He has said he made £2.5million a year from his PR work. The latest accounts for his company, Max Clifford Associates, in 2012 show a turnover of around £3.5million and give the firm an estimated worth of £1.2million. He has also boasted that he got a new Bentley - each worth £200,000 - every two years. However, his legal bills are thought to amount to more than £250,000 and it has been claimed that he has written to previous clients asking for their financial help to meet these costs.","Max Clifford's £6m mansion in Surrey is listed for rent for £12,000-a-month .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Lewis Hamilton is better at making history than studying it. But he could surely see the folly in one famous old telegram sent from the baroque splendour of the Monte Carlo Casino: ‘Cracked the system. Send more money.’ Churchill, Onassis, and the future Edward VII all invested on the green baize in this chandeliered masterpiece. But even if a Briton called Norman Leigh waltzed out of the building with £387,000 in one week in 1966 — or £4.6million in today’s money — most gamblers leave with a hole in their pockets. Beating the system is simply not possible. Nor is it on the newly laid Tarmac of the square outside, with the Cafe de Paris on one corner, or on any part of the wiry streets that stage the Monaco Grand Prix. ‘Monaco is unlike anything else,’ said Hamilton. ‘You know death — not death — but the wall, is just there. That one small turn in too early and you’re gone. Brake a couple of metres too late and you’re in the wall. That’s why it’s the best track. There is no room for error.’ Ready to go: Lewis Hamilton poses for a picture with Nicole Scherzinger and Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst . Glamour couple: Hamilton and Scherzinger attend amfAR's 21st Cinema Against AIDS Gala . Even a slight brush with one of the barriers can spell the end of a driver’s race, such is the shell-like vulnerability of modern cars and tyres. That is what makes today’s qualifying session and tomorrow’s race unmissable. Form, says Hamilton, winner of the last four races, should prevail. It is a track where, despite some of his comments to the contrary, he has previously driven with  conspicuous brilliance, in Formula One and in his soaring journey through the junior ranks. But he will not be the only high-stakes gambler in the Mercedes team. Nico Rosberg, who trails Hamilton by three points in what has turned into a private duel after only five races of a 19-round season, arguably must risk more again. Rosberg has been marginally outperformed by Hamilton at decisive moments this year, such as in qualifying, and starting on pole is more significant in Monaco. In form: Mercedes man Hamilton has won the last four races, and leads Rosberg by three points . Sailing away: Hamilton knows the importance of pole position to winning in Monaco . All eyes on me: The Brit has won the last four races, all with his team-mate Rosberg finishing second . Rosberg has shown remarkable fortitude, born of serene confidence, having been runner-up to Hamilton in Malaysia, Bahrain, China and Spain. It was announced on Friday that he has signed a two-year contract extension with Mercedes — a potential lift to his esteem. Another important boost could be that he won here last year from pole position, whereas Hamilton has yet to qualify fastest in Monaco during seven years in Formula One. ‘That’s true,’ said Hamilton, when reminded of the fact. ‘Jeez, I haven’t been on pole. I was on pole in Formula 3, and GP2, but, yeah, I didn’t even think of that. Damn. ‘In 2009 I had the chance to be on pole but I crashed. Last year, I wasn’t quick enough. This year, I know I’ve got the car. I don’t have an excuse.’ If Hamilton succeeds, it would surely be hard for Rosberg to retain the belief that he can  emulate his father Keke by becoming world champion. Secret weapon? Rosberg wants to stop Hamilton's momentum and stay in touch in the world championship . Snap happy: The German signed a contract extension with Mercedes this week . Home from home: Rosberg grew up in Monaco and walked the roads, which form the track, to get to school . Sir Jackie Stewart, a three-time winner of the Monaco Grand Prix, said: ‘I wouldn’t discount Nico from winning the race. He’s got a really good mind, that boy. He lives in Monte Carlo. He’s come of age as a driver. ‘Getting pole and a good start is crucial. After that, winning in Monte Carlo actually isn’t that hard. The most important thing is not to make mistakes. The new turbo-powered engines make  mistakes more likely. The power doesn’t come in as it does in a  normally aspirated engine; it can come as a bit of a surprise.’ The season — as opposed to Hamilton — needs Rosberg to win and stimulate some rivalry. Ennui is already in danger of setting in. That is why we should welcome Hamilton’s comment that his humble origins in Stevenage make him ‘hungrier’ for success than Rosberg, with his gilded upbringing. Agree or not, it was a rebuke to the sterility of modern Formula One, in which corporate banalities trip off every tongue.","Lewis Hamilton looking for fifth straight victory in Monte Carlo .

"One-time Arsenal target suffers thigh injury to rule him out of tournament . Phillip Lahm, Manuel Neuer and Bastian Schweinsteiger yet to train . Christoph Kramer set to win crocked Bender's place . By . Richard Sharpe . Germany midfielder Lars Bender has been ruled out of the World Cup in Brazil with a thigh injury in another blow to coach Joachim Low's plans. Two days after Germany started their preparations in northern Italy, the Bayer Leverkusen player became the latest injury victim and pulled out of the 27-man provisional squad. The 25-year-old, who has scored four times in 17 international appearances and has attracted interest from Arsenal, picked up a 'combined' muscle and tendon injury in his right thigh in training on Thursday evening and will now leave the camp. Pain game: Lars Bender (L), pictured alongside Mats Hummels during a German training session in Italy on Thursday, will miss the World Cup after suffering a thigh injury . His bad luck follows that of his twin brother Sven, who failed to make the squad because of injury, and throws the door open for unexpected call up Christoph Kramer to claim a World Cup spot. 'When a player is ruled out so close before a tournament then it is very disappointing for everyone,' Low said in a statement. 'I feel personally very sorry for Lars because I know how much he wanted to be in Brazil.' Bender is the latest German to suffer injury with captain Philipp Lahm and first choice keeper Manuel Neuer out for days and still to arrive in Italy because of knocks.

Fellow Bayern Munich team mate Bastian Schweinsteiger is also yet to begin training with the team as he works on his fitness following a knee inflammation, while Real Madrid’s Sami Khedira is also just back from a cruciate ligament tear last year. Top striker Miroslav Klose is racing to get fit in time of the tournament after an injury-plagued season at Italy’s Lazio and has also yet to train with the team. Several other players, including regulars Mario Gomez and Ilkay Guendogan did not even make the provisional squad after failing to return to full fitness from long injury absences this season. The three-time World Cup winners have been drawn in Group G along with Portugal, United States and Ghana.

"By . John Greechan . He hasn’t scored as many goals at Celtic Park as certain rivals in the race to replace Neil Lennon; Oscar Garcia has just the one to his name and, to be honest, the only strike in a 1996 friendly is unlikely to rival any of  Henrik Larsson’s in terms of emotional impact. What the former Barcelona  midfielder lacks in Celtic credentials, though, he perhaps makes up for in suitability for this particular job. Not because he can drop the names of Johan Cruyff and Louis van Gaal into conversations about his formative footballing years. But because his outlook sits so easily with the philosophy of a club constrained by financial realities. Up for the job: Garcia, who left Brighton after narrowly missing out on promotion, has put his name forward . A coach who felt let down by alleged broken promises from the Brighton board last season,  resigning after failure at the  semi-final stages of the  Premier League play-offs, Garcia does not shy away when the issue of  Celtic’s established model — buy ‘em young, flog ‘em for a massive profit — is raised as a potential issue. A short laugh is followed by the ex-Barca Under-19s and Maccabi Tel Aviv boss telling Sportsmail: ‘For me, it’s amazing to work with young players, to develop them — and then, at the end of the day, the club has to decide what is best for the club and the players. ‘But for me to work with young players, I’ve done it all my life, not only at La Masia but in Tel Aviv — I played with a lot of young players. ‘And last season in Brighton, four of the young players from the youth department made their debuts for me. One became the Young Player of the Season, two others are currently playing in Toulon for the England Under-21 national team. ‘Celtic have done very well,  bringing players in and giving them a chance, then maybe moving them on. They have a good  reputation for developing talent. Well-travelled: Garcia won the Israeli title with Maccabi Tel-Aviv before his time in the Championship at Brighton . Playing days: Garcia (right) played at Barcelona where he was team-mates with the likes of Rivaldo (left) ‘I am not afraid to play with young players, if they are good enough. And I know that, in the youth department at Celtic, there are a lot of good players. ‘I know that, already in the club, they have talent. I know that the Under-20s just won their title, so they obviously have good players in there. Celtic is a club that works very hard on developing young players.’ Garcia certainly learned at the feet of masters, citing Cruyff as the greatest of all as he recalls a  Barcelona playing career that saw him share a pitch with Romario, Ronaldo, Hristo Stoichkov and Luis Figo, among others. It is his work as a coach within the fabled La Masia youth system at Barca that really brought him to wider attention, though, and the Celtic coaches who saw his  Under-19s side beat their Hoops counterparts home and away  a few years ago were hugely impressed. Still, working with kids is one thing. Especially at a big club with the pick of the world’s young  talent. What has he done in the senior game? Well, in between dodging Hamas attacks on the city, he guided  Maccabi Tel Aviv to their first league title in 10 years. If he didn’t quite steer Brighton to the  Premier League promised land, he wasn’t that far away. There is a reason that those close to the process describe Garcia as a ‘very credible candidate’ for the Parkhead job. If he has no Celtic roots, that also means he arrives without baggage. Talking tactics: The former Brighton boss explains his thinking to Mailonline using coffee cups . Parameters: The former Maccabi Tel-Aviv boss has shown he can work within financial constraints . Explaining his approach to  football and his own fledgling  managerial career, the 41-year-old said: ‘The biggest influence on me was Johan Cruyff. But I learned a lot from Louis van Gaal, from Jose Mourinho, from Bobby Robson. I had fantastic coaches in Barcelona and I learned a lot from them. ‘But I am Oscar Garcia. However much I learned from these great, great football people, I am myself — I have my thoughts and my thinking. ‘Obviously I agree with the  passing football philosophy,  keeping the ball, trying to keep the opposition moving, play in the opposition half as much as possible. ‘This is the best way to win games — and to make the fans happy. Because, at the end of the day, we play for the fans. They must enjoy to see their team play attractive football. Especially if we are winning. ‘I live my life by feelings. When I moved to Tel Aviv, nobody in  Barcelona thought it was the right thing. I told everybody it was the right thing — but nobody believed me. The same thing happened at Brighton. I move where it feels right. ‘Now I have refused four very good offers because I don’t have the right feelings. They are big clubs but I have refused them. ‘I’ve had some offers in Spain, some offers in England, some from other countries. I’m waiting for the right club, the right offer. I’m sure I will make the right decision. I am a lucky man. I always have decided where I want to manage and coach. I’m confident it will happen the same for me this time.’ Asked if he would choose Celtic over an offer from south of the  border, Garcia said: ‘First of all, I have to speak with the clubs, to have the right offer, the right  feeling. Relaxed: Garcia is interested in the Celtic job but will need to make sure it suits him before accepting any offer . ‘It doesn’t matter if it’s in  England, Scotland, Wales, France, Italy — I don’t care. The only thing I want is to have a good feeling. ‘I will choose a place where I can work as I want and where I have the right trust in the club, the right trust of the people. ‘Could I be happy at Celtic? Nobody has talked to me yet. I have spoken to some clubs, I have refused some offers. Now I am speaking to two big clubs and we’ll see what happens. ‘The good thing is to have enough offers to choose. That’s the reason I’m relaxed, because I believe I will choose correctly.’ Although Garcia is yet to speak with anyone directly about this position, his advisers have ‘put him in’ — to use the football parlance — and are understood to have been pleased with the response. He at least should be familiar to some of the Celtic hierarchy, having formed part of the official Barcelona party for their recent Champions League encounters. And, of course, he has that one challenge match appearance,  telling Sportsmail: ‘Yes, I  remember playing against Celtic — and I scored the goal. If I  remember, we won 1-0, so I was the match winner! ‘The fans of Celtic are amazing. It’s a fantastic stadium and one of the biggest and best clubs in the world. They have all the facilities, as well as passion for the game.’ So maybe he’s not the King of Kings. And maybe his words are only the usual flattery, the kind of stuff we’ve all heard a thousand times before. But he’s young, he’s hungry, he’s got a good pedigree and he seems happy to work within fairly strict financial parameters. As left-field candidates go, he might not be so far out there as to be beyond serious consideration.","Garcia lacks the playing connection to the club, which means no baggage .

"By . John Drayton . David Beckham has hailed Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad selection and believes that England can make an impact in Brazil this summer. Three Lions boss Hodgson has selected a youthful party for the tournament with the likes of Southampton duo Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw, Everton's Ross Barkley and Liverpool's Raheem Sterling complimenting old heads like skipper Steven Gerrard and Chelsea stalwart Frank Lampard. England kick off in Group D against Italy on June 14 with little expectation on their shoulders but Beckham, who won 115 caps, believes Hodgson has got his blend right and is hopeful that his countrymen can cause some upsets. Belief: David Beckham is confident England can impress during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . 'I think it's a really good selection. I think Roy has done really well since he's come in as the manager of England,' he told Sky Sports News. 'It's a great job to have but it's a tough job. 'You've got players that are playing at the top of their game and I think what he's done is pick players that are at the top of their game. 'They're young players, they've had great seasons. People have been saying it for years about players coming in to a big competition like this - it's not about that anymore. 'These young players have been playing in the biggest league in the world this season and quite a few seasons so there's no players that are going to go on to this stage and be affected by it because you've got players that are playing, week in and week out, against some of the best players in the world and in the biggest league in the world and for some of the biggest clubs in the world. 'You've got a captain like Stevie G (Gerrard) that has has had one of the best seasons probably for him and that Liverpool have had for quite a while. 'You've got players like that that are well respected by the young players and that the young players will want to play for. 'So I think that we can cause a few upsets and a few surprises but obviously we have a tough group but there is no reason why we can't go really far in this competition. Bright future: Becks believes Roy Hodgson was right to take Luke Shaw (left) and Adam Lallana to Brazil . Getting ready: England's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left), Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge have all been selected . 'You're coming up against a great team, the Italians, they always perform well in World Cups. They've got great players and a great history but that can be a good thing for us. 'We always perform well against the big teams and it doesn't get much bigger than this.' England's opener against Italy is to be contested in Manaus and Hodgson has openly expressed his concern over playing at the amazon venue where humidity can reach upwards of 80 per cent. But Beckham travelled to three World Cups with England as a player, as well as being part of Fabio Capello's staff in 2010, and has few concerns about preparation . 'Roy and his staff, they're going to have all the lads prepared as much as possible,' he said. 'The preparation for World Cups for England teams is always top class, they're always looked after on every level and that won't be any different for this World Cup. Bold: England boss Roy Hodgson has selected several young players for his World Cup squad . 'The humidity and the heat is obviously going to be a factor but you can only prepare enough for those first games and they'll do well.' The last time England faced Italy was in the quarter finals at Euro 2012 when they lost on penalties with spot kicks also proving to be their downfall at the World Cup in 1990, 1998 and 2006 and the Euros in 1996 and 2004. Beckham is sure, however, that the injection of players not scarred by past failure can help Hodgson's men. Three Lions: Beckham travelled to three World Cups with England as a player . Experience: Hodgson has still gone with England stalwarts Steven Gerrard (left) and Frank Lampard . 'We haven't had success in big competitions but sometimes it can be over-thought,' he said. 'Stevie G has scored some great penalties before . 'You've got some young players who are going to step up and not even be worried about it . 'They're going to go there and they don't even have to worry penalties for quite a few games so just enjoy the occasion. 'There's no bigger competition in the world than the World Cup and for a player to be going there it makes them proud.'","David Beckham claims Roy Hodgson was right to select young players for England's World Cup squad .

There . were some grim sights for watching England head coach Stuart Lancaster. Bath’s electric wing, Anthony Watson, hobbled off with a suspected . hamstring strain and his team-mate, prop David Wilson, was removed after . being treated for what appeared to be pain in his shoulder. The . Saints’ challenge was founded on a dominant scrum, with Alex Corbisiero . making his presence felt before being yellow-carded for illegally . charging into a ruck after the ball was out. But before their . second-half decline, Bath capitalised on Springbok flanker Francois . Louw’s ability to wreak regular havoc at the breakdown. Almost wasted: Luther Burrell crossed the line but Northampton needed Ben Foden's input to score the try . Close call: Ben Foden gets the last touch to score the match-clinching try for the Saints in the closing stages . Watson . struck from 60 metres out in the first half when ruck pressure created a . turnover, but once the pendulum had swung Northampton’s way and Myler’s . right boot edged his team ahead, the Saints crossed the line twice late . on. Dowson scored from a lineout catch and drive, before Foden applied . the crucial touch after a midfield break-away almost came to nothing. ‘It’s . been hugely frustrating in the last four years to go so close to . winning titles and not quite getting over the line, so it is great to . finally get winners medals,’ said Northampton captain Tom Wood. ‘We want . to go on and get that Double now.’ Mallinder . added: ‘This sets us up perfectly for a massive challenge in the . Premiership Final and we’ve got a good chance. Saracens are a great team . but we’ ll look forward to watching them play tomorrow and hopefully . Toulon will get stuck into them!’ Arms up: Bath and Northampton contest a line-out at Cardiff Arms Park . Dominant: Myler controlled the game after the break as the Saints overpowered Bath . Referee . Jerome Garces awarded Bath a penalty that Ford missed, but he opted not . to award a yellow card that England flanker Wood's indiscretion . warranted. Northampton did . not learn their lesson, though, and three minutes after the break . Corbisiero was sin-binned for tackling Bath captain Stuart Hooper off . the ball, but Ford again drifted his kick wide. Myler . then completed his penalty hat-trick and it was the cue for Bath boss . Mike Ford to make his first change as scrum-half Peter Stringer replaced . Micky Young before Ford missed with another shot at goal. Ford's . inaccuracy off the kicking tee came as an unexpected bonus for . Northampton, and it meant they were still in a game that Bath should . have been on the verge of closing out. Crossing over: Saints flanker Phil Dowson (left) celebrates his try with Christian Day (centre) in Cardiff . Just reward: Anthony Watson sped away to score a deserved first-half try for Bath . But . Bath substitute prop Anthony Perenise was yellow-carded 10 minutes from . time and Northampton made them pay instantly when Dowson was driven . over from a lineout and Myler's conversion sealed the deal. A . Myler interception of Ford's pass then had Bath retreating rapidly in . defence, and although supporting centre Luther Burrell slipped with the . line at his mercy, Saints had enough players in support for assist Foden . and Garces awarded the try on confirmation from television match . official Eric Gauzins.

"By . Phil Casey . Luke Donald planned to treat himself to a curry after moving into contention for a third BMW PGA Championship title in four years on Friday. Donald carded a superb 67 at Wentworth to finish six under par, four shots behind joint leaders Thomas Bjorn and Shane Lowry and one ahead of the likes of Henrik Stenson and Rory McIlroy. The former world No 1 carded six birdies and an eagle after the weather improved in late afternoon, with a run of five threes in succession from the eighth culminating in an eagle on the 12th. 'When we were warming up the rain was coming down pretty heavy and the wind was blowing hard,' said 2011 and 2012 champion Donald, who would join the likes of Colin Montgomerie, Bernhard Langer and Nick Faldo as three-time champions of the European Tour’s flagship event. Back in the hunt: Luke Donald shot a sensational 67 for the second round of the BMW PGA Championship . Surge: England's Donald is now four shots off the leaders after an impressive round on Friday . 'It was wet for six or seven holes but for the rest of the day it was pretty nice. I’m happy with the way I played and I holed some long putts which is always a bonus. 'Being nine behind after the first day seems like a big mountain to climb but now I’m back in position to try to win this championship again.' Donald finished his round in style with a birdie from 25 feet on the 18th and added: 'Dinner will taste good, I might enjoy a good curry. It’s hard to find one in the States.' Bjorn had set a new course record with his opening 62 and was pleased to recover from two over par after seven holes on Friday to return a 72, three better than playing partner Stephen Gallacher managed as the Scot fell away to one over for the week. 'Those were tough conditions for everybody out there today,' the 43-year-old Dane said. 'Especially on the front nine it was extremely difficult to get into a rhythm. Back with the pack: Thomas Bjorn returned a 72 on day two after his course record 62 on Thursday . 'We played those first four holes in I don’t know how long, and we had a couple of rulings in front of us. It was just impossible to find a good rhythm and Retief (Goosen) left us with a back injury after five holes, so we got caught in a two-ball. 'It just seems like all day we were waiting and waiting for a long time on a lot of these shots. It was a tough ask today so I was pretty pleased with the way I finished the round.' Bjorn birdied two of the last four holes to finish where he started the day, on 10 under, with Lowry recovering from a double-bogey six on the ninth with birdies on the 10th, 12th, 17th and 18th. Lowry won the Irish Open in bad weather as an amateur in 2009 and is a massive fan of Wentworth, finishing fourth here in 2011 and 12th last year. 'I was good out there today,' said Lowry, whose best finish of the season was a share of 15th in the Spanish Open last week. 'I was mentally there and really enjoyed it. 'It was tough for the front nine with the rain and stuff but it was a nice back nine and I managed to take advantage of it.' Mixed conditions: Joint leader Shane Lowry battled rain on the front nine but came home strong . Earlier in the day, McIlroy went from flirting with a third consecutive missed cut in this event to a place inside the top 10. A front nine of 38 left the former world number one just a shot outside the projected cut mark, but he eagled the 12th for the second day running and added birdies at three of the last four holes for a 71. McIlroy announced on Wednesday that he had called off his planned November wedding to former world number one tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, even though the invitations had just been sent out. 'I was apprehensive going out yesterday, I honestly didn’t know what to expect and it was good I had the quick turnaround to get back on the golf course,' the 25-year-old said. 'I have exceeded my expectations so far. Once you get inside the ropes you are concentrating on your golf and it’s almost a nice four or five-hour release to concentrate on the job at hand. 'I stood here yesterday saying that I would be happy to make the cut and I’m in for the weekend, which is nice. Hopefully I can make a run at it. I feel like I’m playing well enough to shoot something in the mid 60s and get myself in the mix going into Sunday.'","Donald now within four shots of leaders Thomas Bjorn and Shane Lowry .

"By . Emma Innes . A three-year-old girl has been given the all-clear after spending half of her life battling an aggressive form of cancer. Anya Bentham was just 19 months old when her parents Naomi Stanley, 28, and Graeme Bentham, 34, noticed their daughter was struggling to stand on her left leg and that she was walking with a limp. Doctors were mystified and ran a series of tests, even operating on her hip and her pelvis before an oncologist noticed a tiny spot behind her kidney on an MRI scan. Joy: Anya Bentham (with parents Naomi and Graeme) has been given the all-clear after spending half of her life battling an aggressive form of cancer . Shock: Anya was just 19 months old when she was diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma, a rare type of childhood cancer which affects the nerve cells . Anya was diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma, a rare type of childhood cancer which affects the nerve cells. Miss Stanley, a stay-at-home mother, and Mr Bentham, an engineer, were told to prepare themselves for the worst as further tests revealed the cancer had spread to her bones. The toddler was immediately started on a course of intensive chemotherapy and she also had to have surgery to remove the tumour and pioneering immunotherapy – a treatment which involves using the body’s own immune system to help fight the cancer. Anya became so frail that her parents made the heart-breaking decision on October 17, 2012 to film her all day in the belief every day could be her last. Miss Stanley said: ‘She was so sick. Fighting: The toddler was immediately started on a course of intensive chemotherapy and had surgery to remove the tumour . Despair: Anya became so frail that her parents made the heart-breaking decision on October 17, 2012 to film her all day in the belief every day could be her last . U-turn: To everyone's surprise, Anya suddenly rallied and has now finished her treatment . ‘We had been filming her on-and-off all day until at 9pm she suddenly became alert. ‘She just sat up and demanded some toast - it was as if someone had flicked a switch. ‘She had been unresponsive for days. Doctors and nurses told us later that they didn’t expect her to survive more than a few weeks after her initial diagnosis. ‘When we saw her respond like that we realised we had a fighting chance.’ Since then Anya’s response to treatment has continued to startle doctors who tragically witness many youngsters succumbing to either the gruelling treatment or to the disease. Miss Stanley said: ‘She’ll never be able to have children and we’ll have to wait and see what the lasting effects of the treatment are, but she’s a little fighter.’ Anya’s boisterous antics have even earned her the nickname ‘warrior princess’. Hope: Anya's mother Naomi said: Miss Stanley said: 'There's always the chance of a relapse but at the moment we're over the moon that Anya has finished her treatment' Miss Stanley said: ‘Just six days after the operation to remove the tumour from behind her kidney, Anya grabbed her toy sword and charged around the house yelling, “I am strong!” ‘She’s quite a character. She once squirted one of the consultants in the face with a water pistol.’ Now that Anya has completed her immunotherapy treatment, she has rejoined her step brothers Stephen, 13, and Adam, 10 at the family home in Chester. Progress: Anya will start nursery this summer, but she will need regular tests and scans . Miss Stanley said: ‘This is all she has ever known - she doesn’t know any different. She thinks she’s going into hospital to play.’ Anya will start nursery this summer, but she will need regular tests and scans. Miss Stanley said: ‘There’s always the chance of a relapse but at the moment we’re over the moon that Anya has finished her treatment.’ To date, the family has raised an amazing £213,000 for children’s charity Neuroblastoma Children’s Cancer Alliance so that funds are available if Anya should need further treatment that is not available on the NHS. Because four out of five children relapse after treatment, Anya’s appeal will remain open both to build funds should she need urgent life-saving treatment, but also to raise awareness of neuroblastoma. If after five years the funds are not needed for Anya, they will be used to help another family or go towards neuroblastoma research. Miss Stanley said: ‘I wish I could say after we have these results that Anya will be in remission, that she has beaten this awful disease. ‘With neuroblastoma there is never an official remission. It can - and does in many children - come back, usually in the first two years after treatment, but relapses can even occur ten years down the line. ‘For the rest of Anya’s life she will need regular scans and tests. ‘We will never be able to shake the all-consuming stress and terror and anxiety of cancer but it is a price we willingly pay to keep our daughter with us.'

It usually starts in the child's abdomen, often developing in the adrenal glands above the kidneys. It can then spread to other areas such as the bones, liver and skin. The cancer affects about 100 children in the UK each year and is usually diagnosed in under-5s. It is the most common form of solid tumour cancer in childhood after brain tumours. The symptoms depend on where the cancer is and whether it has spread. Initial symptoms often include aches and pains and loss of appetite. The most common symptom when the cancer has developed is a lump or swelling in the child's abdomen. Other . possible symptoms are a lump in the child's neck, bone pain, weakness . in the child's lower body, anaemia and bluish lumps in the skin. Because the early symptoms are vague, the cancer is often not diagnosed until it has spread around the body. The outlook is better if the child is younger and the cancer is slower growing. It is common for the cancer to return after treatment and treatment tends to be less successful in older children.","Anya Bentham had a limp and struggled to stand on her leg as a toddler .

"By . Mark Prigg . Astronomers are expecting a new meteor shower to light up the sky above America tonight. No one has seen it before, but the shower could put on a show that would rival the prolific Perseid meteor shower in August. The Camelopardalids shower would be dust resulting from a periodic comet, 209P/LINEAR. Scroll down for video . Scientists are anticipating a new meteor shower, the May Camelopardalids, that could put on a show that would rival the prolific Perseid meteor shower in August. Comet 209P/LINEAR was discovered in February 2004 by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research project, a cooperative effort of NASA, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory, and the US Air Force. It is a relatively dim comet that dips inside the orbit of Earth once every five years as it loops around the sun. While orbiting, the closest it comes to the Sun is 0.9 AU (84 million miles) and the farthest it gets from the Sun is about 5 AU (465 million miles), close to Jupiter’s orbit. This year, 209P will have a close approach to Earth on May 29. It will come within a distance of 0.04 AU,  about 3.7 million miles, of our planet. If the comet was actively producing a lot of dust during that time, the Earth may be treated to a new meteor shower, tentatively named the May Camelopardalids. 'Some forecasters have predicted a meteor storm of more than 200 meteors per hour,” said Bill Cooke, lead for NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office. 'We have no idea what the comet was doing in the 1800s. The parent comet doesn’t appear to be very active now, so there could be a great show, or there could be little activity.' NASA scientists at Marshall Space Flight Center expect the shower to be active between 02:30 and 11:00 UTC on May 24 (that’s 10:30 p.m. on May 23 to 7:00 a.m. on May 24 EDT), and to peak between 06:00 and 08:00 UTC on May 24 (2:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. EDT). The May Camelopardalid radiant is in the constellation Camelopardalis, which translates to 'camel leopard' or . giraffe . Nasa says North America has a pretty good seat for this cosmic event - if there are no clouds. It advises: 'Find a safe, dark location and lay out beneath the stars. 'You don’t need to look in any particular direction, just straight up. 'Meteors can appear all over the sky.' Comet 209P/LINEAR was discovered in February 2004 by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research project, a cooperative effort of NASA, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory, and the US Air Force. It is a relatively dim comet that dips inside the orbit of Earth once every five years as it loops around the sun. Two years ago, meteor experts Esko Lyytinen of Finland and Peter Jenniskens at NASA Ames Research Center announced that Earth was due for an encounter with debris from Comet 209P/LINEAR. Comet 209P/LINEAR on May 15, 2014. Even though the comet will travel close to Earth, you won¿t be able to see it with the naked eye . Streams of dust ejected by the comet mainly back in the 1800s would cross Earth's orbit on May 24, 2014. The result, they said, could be a significant meteor outburst. 'We expect these meteors to radiate from a point in Camelopardalis, also known as 'the giraffe,' a faint constellation near the North Star,' Cooke said. 'It’s a great opportunity to see a new meteor shower - an opportunity I want to see with my own eyes.'","would rival the prolific Perseid meteor shower in August .

Lambert has converted all 34 penalties he has taken for Southampton since he joined from Bristol Rovers in August 2009. He hasn’t missed from the spot since February that year when he was still playing for the Pirates. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rickie Lambert talk about how his career has moved on . Spot on: Rickie Lambert wants to be given the responsibility of taking England's penalties at the World Cup . On target: Lambert has converted all 34 penalties he has taken since signing for Southampton back in 2009 . Lambert said: ‘If the chance comes up I am comfortable to score. A lot of people have said I am in for my penalties but I don’t believe that at all. But I would take one, of course I would. I am confident in my ability.’ Wayne Rooney is England’s regular penalty-taker but Lambert is lethal from 12 yards. The Southampton striker is guaranteed to be one of England’s nominated penalty-takers if they are taken to yet another shootout at a major tournament. England have a dreadful record in shootouts and were predictably beaten by Italy at Euro 2012 when it came to penalties against Cesare Prandelli’s side. Lambert added: ‘I have my own technique and sometimes my technique wouldn’t be beneficial to someone else. It is a little bit of practice but mainly it is about mentality. I have a certain way of approaching it and it has worked well for me.’ Tussle: Lambert battles Phil Jagielka for the ball during an England training session on Wednesday . Earlier this week, Lambert, in a book called Twelve Yards: The Art and Psychology of the Perfect Penalty, claimed professionals should never miss. The Saints striker is quoted as saying: ‘I see a penalty as a free shot from 12 yards and a professional should score from that distance 10 times out of 10, so if you hit it well you’ll be all right.’ Southampton team-mate Luke Shaw, who spoke alongside Lambert at an England media day, has only taken one penalty in competition. He said: ‘I took one playing for England  Under 17s, it might have been Under 16s. I remember it hit the bar, I’m not sure it went in but it counted anyway. ‘That is the only penalty I have taken.’ WORLD CUP 1990 SEMI-FINALWest Germany 4 England 3Scored: Lineker, Beardsley, Platt.Missed: Pearce, Waddle.

"By . Ted Thornhill . A fairytale wedding is a popular dream – but one US couple is making it a reality, by restoring a castle to use as a venue. Daniel Edwards and Ebony Burnside, from Kansas City, want to transform the city’s dilapidated 1897 former jail - the Workhouse Castle - into a stunning environment to hold their June 8 ceremony. The total cost will be somewhere in the region of three to four million dollars, so to help raise funds for the project, the pair are turning to crowd-sourcing and asking for donations through the non-profit 2orMore organization that Mr Edwards runs. Fairytale wedding: Ebony Burnside and Daniel Edwards plan to tie the knot at the historic Workhouse Castle in Kansas City . Clean-up: Volunteers from Mr Edwards' community youth organization have begun to rid the castle of graffiti and trash . Its aim is to encourage 20 to 30 year-olds to tackle community projects. At the moment the castle is in the clean-up stage, with Mr Edwards’ using his 2orMore volunteers to rid the structure of graffiti and trash. So far they’ve raised $12,000. Once they’ve garnered enough money they hope to build a community garden and an internet café at the castle. Run down: The castle has fallen into disrepair and doesn't even have a roof . Expensive undertaking: The total cost of the restoration will be somewhere in the region of three to four million dollars . Mr Edwards, an architectural engineer, explained that he was keen to use the wedding as an opportunity to give something back to the community. He told The Kansas City Star: ‘I’m not really big on weddings. I asked her [Ms Burnside] “Can we reinvest into the community instead of giving our money to some established venue?”’ The idea to use the castle came to them as they drove around the city looking for venues, after Mr Edwards had proposed. Ms Burnside said she had no idea that the castle even existed. ‘This castle here made sense, given that our wedding theme is legendary,’ Ms Burnside said. For more information visit to 2orMore.org.

"By . Mike Dawes . and Simon Tomlinson . Rory McIlroy has ended his relationship with Caroline Wozniacki, according to reports. Sources close to the pair claim the Irish golfer broke off from the Danish tennis star days after she posted a 'mean' picture on Twitter showing him fast asleep and open-mouthed with his glasses on. Friends say there was no way back as McIlroy attempts to recapture the form that took him to world No 1. Wozniacki, 23, is said to be 'absolutely devastated'. End of the line? Friends say Rory McIlroy and his tennis star girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki have split after two years together . 'Pretty mean thing to do': Friends say the golfer's decision came last month days after Wozniacki posted this embarrassing picture on Twitter of McIlroy fast asleep with the message: 'Jetlag? Lol!!' A source told the Sunday Independent: 'Yes they are over. It's a difficult time for them both but it is for the best in the long run.' The paper said the split came days after Wozniacki last month posted an embarrassing picture online of the two-time major winner asleep with the message: 'Jetlag? Lol!!'. One source said: 'Rory was very upset by it and even Serena Williams pointed out – albeit in a joking way – it was a pretty mean thing to do.' The source added: 'There were a lot of . tears. Rory . has a lot of respect for Caroline and their time together was good, but . he feels it's time to move on now. And he wishes her nothing but the . best.' What a drive: MciIroy and Wozniacki sharing a buggy at the Singapore open last year . Loved up: Rory McIlroy and Caroline Wozniacki during the par-three competition at The Masters earlier this year . McIlroy recently confirmed his split with Horizon Sports Management and a legal battle gets underway today. When contacted by MailOnline, his new PR team said: 'The Communications Clinic does not comment on Rory's private life.' A spokesman for Wozniacki has not responded to a request for comment from MailOnline. The 24-year-old is now heading to Asia where he will earn around £3million in appearances fees over the next month. Earlier this year, McIlroy was warned by Britain's greatest-ever golfer Nick Faldo to 'concentrate on golf' after a dramatic slump in form. Over the last year, the 24-year-old has changed his clubs and his management company while his relationship with Wozniacki is also considered by some as a factor. Struggling: McIlroy has failed to match his success of previous years since signing with Nike . Faldo said at the time: 'You have a . window of opportunity. You have a 20-year window as an athlete. Concentrate on golf, nothing else. 'Hopefully, . when you retire, 40s, 50s, you will have another 40 years to enjoy it. So just concentrate on golf. I think there’s a lot going on in his . mind.' Last December, the pair were forced to deny rumours they were engaged after Wozniacki was spotted wearing a huge diamond ring on her wedding ring finger. Speculation first began when the tennis star was seen flashing the diamond and sapphire jewel as she arrived at Brisbane International Airport. However, it's also tradition for Danish women to wear their engagement and wedding rings on the right hands, indicating that the jewel may have just been a recent Christmas present.

"By . Associated Press . He's known as the 'Pillowcase rapist,' and spent the last 20 years in a California mental hospital. Prosecutors say 62-year-old Christopher Hubbart sexually assaulted some 40 women. Now he is set to be released and move into a residential community north of Los Angeles by the first week of July in spite of a host of vocal protests. Neighbors there say they are angry, afraid and fighting to keep him out. So many arrests: Mr Hubbart was released into parole multiple times, and he assaulted women every single time - forcing officials to arrest and re-incarcerate him . Home sweet home: This is the Lake Los Angeles home officials have decided will house the serial rapist . Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Gilbert Brown issued a brief order saying that Hubbart, 63, must be released by July 7, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement. With several severe restrictions that include 24-hour GPS monitoring, Hubbart will be allowed to rent a small house in a remote area in Lake Los Angeles, near the city of Palmdale. The decision comes two days after a daylong hearing in Northern California, where Brown heard passionate objections from residents, many of whom drove 350 miles north from Southern California. Hubbart's most recent crimes occurred in Santa Clara County, but Brown ordered him released to Los Angeles County, where Hubbart was born and raised. Fighting back: Protests took place in 1994, pictured, when Hubbart was due to be released however he failed psychological testing and was committed to a state hospital . A very sick man: Christopher Hubbart admitted to raping 38 women, but said about 70 other rapes went unreported . Hubbart has acknowledged raping and assaulting about 40 women between 1971 and 1982, when he was sentenced to 16 years in prison. He was paroled in 1990, but arrested in a new attack just two months later and returned to prison until 1996. When his term ended, he was deemed a sexually violent predator and confined to a state mental hospital. Doctors at the hospital recently concluded he was fit for release, but few options were available. California laws bar sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of schools and other places where children congregate, eliminating nearly all urban areas in the state. Furious: Bart Stone says he has no choice but to move if the rapist relocates to the neighborhood . Local leaders quickly denounced the decision. County Supervisor Michael Antonovich called it 'an unconscionable threat to public safety.' Palmdale Mayor James Ledford said he was 'a little upset' on learning the news. 'It's very disappointing, very disappointing that this guy with this kind of record in the past would be put into any community,' he said. Ledford said the city is going to continue to try to fight the order. ‘I have a daughter, so this isn't going to work for me,’ Bart Stone told NBC. Mr Stone stood in front of the house and pointed about 100 feet down the street to a school bus stop. ‘That’s where children get off,’ he angrily shouted. Just a door down from a bus stop: 'You see that right there, past the PT Cruiser, that's where the drop the kids off' Mr Stone points to and explains . The home is within a few miles of two schools and only 2,200 feet from a nearby park – just outside the limits of Jessica’s Law, which prohibits predators from living closer than 2,000 feet to any park or school. The landlord of the property has agreed to rent the home to Hubbart, seeing as it falls within the laws for sex offenders. ‘The bus stop is right in front of my house, with all the kids,’ Steve Villavicincio told CBS Los Angeles, ‘I don’t know what the heck’s going on with that.’ Markeisha Brooks, 19, pointed to three houses where children live, telling CBS Los Angeles that ‘a lot of children live around here… he’s a rapist and he can do it again.’ Mr Hubbart was put on parole multiple times, and kept raping women in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas, terrorizing the state with his deviancy. Officials are also united in their displeasure to dump the rapist in the community. The pervert’s most recent sojourn back into custody came because he couldn’t control his violent urges, Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich told KNX. 'That's crazy': Steve Villavicincio lives next door, the bus stop is in front of his home, he cannot believe officials think the home is suitable for a rapist . ‘He belongs in a mental institution, a state hospital’ Mr Antonovich said during a recent press conference, ‘he does not belong in a community with children where he will once again commit these crimes.’ ‘His past behavior is not a one-time occurrence where he made a mistake. We’re talking over and over again,’ Mr Antonovich added. They're taking someone who is not from here — who has a horrific criminal record — and they're dumping him in the [area],’ a Palmdale city spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times. ‘We don't think that's right,’ the spokesperson added. Mr Hubbart was first arrested in 1972 for multiple rapes in southern California, he soon admitted raping 20 women, records cited by the Times show. Only seven years later, he was released from a mental health institution after doctors deemed him a changed man. He was snagged again in 1982 for raping more women. Based on his own estimates, Mr Hubbart raped well over 100 women. ‘It really angers me,’ another local resident told the Times. ‘My wife and I are getting to the point where we're anxious to leave California anyway. That might get us to... move quicker.’ Mr Hubbart will be required to wear a GPS monitor at all times, an official told the Times. The monitor will be able to alert authorities if he violates the terms of his release by beng to close to a school or park, or even if he violates curfew. Still, that’s not enough to satisfy people living in the proposed area. Not in our neighborhood!: Residents are furious the predator is set to live only feet from a school bus stop and within a few miles of multiple schools . ‘This is like a bad dream right now because I'm going to have to move out of this neighborhood,’ Mr Stone told NBC Bay Area . Cheryl Holbrook, one of the residents who drove north to the hearing and a member of a community group created to fight the release, said she and others from the Ladies of Lake LA were already heading to protest at Hubbart's new home, which is about five miles from her own. Holbrook said she was shaking because of the news, which she said was made worse by terrible memories of being raped as a 14-year-old by two men at knifepoint and impregnated. 'I think it's wrong,' Holbrook said. 'When this guy commits another crime, the blood's going to be on that judge's shoulders.'","Christopher Hubbart, 62, the notorious California 'pillowcase rapist' admitted to 38 rapes, he told authorities another 70 went unreported .
