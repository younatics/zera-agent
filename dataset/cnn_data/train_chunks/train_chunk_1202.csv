"The family of one of the two teenage students who died after falling 60ft from a luxury apartment block balcony have visited the scene of the tragedy. Mexican Miguel Ramos, 18, and 19-year-old Anastasia Tutik were in a clinch when they lost their balance during a party in Depford, South East London, to mark the end of exams. Today Miguel's grieving father Miguel Lozano Munguia was among family members who visited the scene. 'Tragic accident': Anastasia Tutik, 19, fell from a sixth-floor balcony with 18-year-old identified as Miguel Ramos, right, shortly after midnight in Deptford, south east London. They were believed to be at a party . Two teenagers died after plunging from the sixth floor balcony (circled) of this riverside apartment block . He is the former mayor of the town of . Pesqueria in Mexico and was once head of the centre-left Institutional . Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the state of Nueva Leon. The family arrived at the block, Knights Tower, around midday. They were escorted by a driver employed by the college and were greeted by another teenage Mexican boy. He was thought to be Alfonso, a friend of Miguel's who was at the party. The pair were celebrating at a luxury . apartment with fellow students . from Bellerbys College, an international school which charges fees of up . to £21,000 a year. Witnesses described hearing a huge bang in the early hours. Samson . Oguntayo, 32, who lives in a neighbouring block, said: ‘They were . trying to have sex on the balcony. The guy was lifting the girl and . putting her on the bannister, he kept on doing it. ‘You could see they were doing some really dangerous stuff. ‘At . some point friends must have come outside and they got down and came . back inside and then came back out again. They started doing it again. ‘You . see people on the balcony doing all sorts of things and I just felt . they will probably go back inside. The last thing I expected was to see . them falling down. We just screamed.’ Tragedy: Anastasia Tutik, 19 (pictured) was believed to be at a party in the sixth-floor apartment .

"A female babysitter has been jailed for 16 years for helping a known paedophile rape a three-year-old boy in her care. Claire Semmens, 28, handed the child over to Aaron Hughes, who filmed the attacks on his mobile phone so he could watch them again on his computer. Hughes, 32, was caught when police checked his computer because they believed he had breached a court order by downloading child pornography. Claire Semmens (left) handed a young boy in her care to paedophile Aaron Hughes (right), who drugged the child before carrying out and filming two rape attacks . A court heard officers discovered . Hughes had filmed himself raping a child on two occasions at Semmens’s . home while she was babysitting children. Both attacks were on the same three-year-old boy, who had been drugged to sedate him. Hughes has now been jailed for life for the horrific attacks. Prosecutor . Laurence Jones said: ‘The rapes were carried out at separate times – . but both were on the same boy and they happened in Semmens’s bedroom. ‘Semmens . not only supplied the boy but provided a room which enabled Hughes to . commit the act and film it in a relatively safe haven.’ He . continued: ‘By her own admission Semmens knew Hughes was a child sex . offender who was banned from having any contact with children. But she . was trying to satisfy Hughes’s perversions for young male children.’ Semmens provided a babysitting service at her home but was handing one child over to child rapist Hughes . The court heard Semmens was attracted to Hughes’s gay lover Hamish Morgan and the three had become close friends. Hughes . had a previous conviction for raping a six-year-old boy and Semmens . hoped that by providing children to Hughes it would clear the way for . her to have a relationship with Mr Morgan. Mr Jones said: ‘Aaron Hughes had to be kept happy so she would supply him with a young boy. ‘She had the opportunity to do this because she was a babysitter, regularly looking after boys aged between three and six.’ The . court heard Hughes and Mr Morgan had moved into a flat in Roath, . Cardiff, next door to where Semmens provided a babysitting service. But it wasn’t until police raided Hughes’s home that they discovered he was preying on one of the boys in her care. He told police he sedated the child before raping him. Mr Jones said: ‘In the video clip you can see the little boy’s eyes are closed.’ The . court heard police also found naked images of two other boys that . Semmens was entrusted with, while child pornography was also found on . her laptop. Hughes and Semmens disappeared when they realised the images found on their computers would send them to jail. The . pair pawned their jewellery and took a train to Gatwick Airport – . fleeing in such a hurry Semmens’ pet hamsters were left to die of . starvation. When they were arrested Hughes told  officers he suffered . from a multiple personality disorder and he was not responsible for . raping the boy in January 2013. Yesterday Semmens and Hughes showed no expression in the dock at Cardiff Crown Court. Describing . the crimes as ‘genuinely horrendous offences’, Judge Philip Richards . said: ‘It almost defies belief that any human being would do such a . thing to such an innocent young child. ‘You . Semmens made that child available not once but twice to your paedophile . friend and  permitted him to carry out his vile activities with that . young child in your bedroom. ‘You knew full well he was a child abuser and the level of breach of trust is probably worse than Hughes. ‘Each of you are going to spend a long time in prison before you see the light of day.’ Semmens, . of Roath, Cardiff, admitted two charges of causing or inciting a child . to engage in sexual activity and possessing indecent images. Hughes, . also from Roath,  Cardiff, admitted two charges of rape, possessing . indecent images and breaching the terms of his sex offenders prevention . order. He was jailed for life and told he would not be considered for parole until he has served 12 years in prison. Both were barred from ever working with children and must sign the sex offenders register for life.

"A married physics professor has been arrested for allegedly running a prostitution website with 200 women and more than 1,400 clients. David Flory, who teaches at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey,  set up the site so 'trusted' users could find, rate and review prostitutes in Albuquerque, New Mexico, near his second home in Santa Fe. Flory, a grandfather, allegedly told police he thought of the website as a helpful hobby, which he designed as 'a safe place for guys to find female prostitutes.' Undercover sting: David Flory, 68, has been charged with 40 counts of promoting prostitution for allegedly running an escort website . Police are now trawling through the client database to find out who was using the website, and are urging members to give themselves up. Flory was arrested in Albuquerque on . Sunday after a six-month undercover operation to track down who was . behind the site, Southwest Companions. Officers claim Flory, who is in his late . sixties, was even logged on to the website via his phone when they . arrested him in a branch of Starbucks. Double life: David Flory, a physics professor, taught at the same university for 42 years . He and his wife Sharon, a psychotherapist who specialises in eating disorders, live in an apartment in Manhattan's exclusive Upper West Side, but keep a holiday home in Santa Fe. They rent out the house, called Casa de Los Arboles, and say it 'provides 2,800 square feet of gracious living'. They have two adult daughters, Gillian and Miranda, a stepdaughter, Cynthia, and four grandchildren. Flory has a masters degree from Columbia University and a PhD from Yeshiva, and has taught at Fairleigh Dickinson since 1969. According to police, Southwest . Companions was run entirely by Flory, who designed three categories of . membership, each of which had to be approved by him. First-time visitors had to gain Flory's trust before they could access the website, police said. They did this by sleeping with one of the girls, who allegedly reported back to Flory with details of payment and the sexual acts performed. At this point members were classed as 'verified', and could access more of the site. Luxury: The New Mexico holiday home owned by David Flory and his wife Sharon . Elegant: According to the couple's website, their house in New Mexico 'provides 2,800 square feet of gracious living' Only once they became frequent users were they upgraded to 'trusted' members, allowing them to view the whole site - including tips on how to avoid police. Lieutenant William Roseman said  'Once you became a trusted member you had access to reviews of the . girls... where they would actually write reviews of the girls they've . slept with, what acts they would commit, how much their charged.' He told the Record: 'They had descriptions of my officers, phone numbers they used, videos . of an attorney telling them that if you get busted by the police, here’s . what you should do. 'This was a website designed, . managed and run fully for prostitution.' He said police tracked Flory down after one of the prostitutes tipped them off. Explicit: Forums on the website contained tips on how to avoid being arrested, a guide to the 'hobby' and a section called 'sweet seduction' Tips: The website allowed users to rank and review prostitutes, and had around 1,400 clients . Undercover detectives then posed as website users for months, eventually becoming 'trusted' members so they could see the whole site and eventually find Flory. He was arrested on Sunday and is being held in Albuquerque on $100,000 bail. He has been charged with 40 counts of promoting prostitution. Dina Schipper, a spokesman for Fairleigh Dickinson, said she could not comment on whether Flory was still employed by the university, but she said staff were 'saddened' by the news. She told the Record: 'Our hearts go out to all of those impacted by the situation. 'Since becoming aware of the arrest, the university has cooperated . with law enforcement authorities as they seek to gain the most accurate . information as part of their ongoing investigation in New Mexico.'","Website allowed users to rank and review more than 200 prostitutes .

"An obese mother who weighed nearly 21 stone has lost a third of her body weight in two years after she swapped sugary snacks for mushy peas. Kim Eyre, 34, tipped the scales at 20st 9lbs after years of eating sausage rolls, crisps and chocolate bars. At her heaviest, Kim had a 46in waist and was so encumbered by her size that it took her several minutes to walk to her front door. Decision: The school administrator decided to . lose weight after seeing a picture of herself at an office party where she says she was the 'biggest by far' of all her colleagues . Super slimmer: Kim Eyre shed eight stone in just two years by ditching chocolate bars to snack on mushy peas . But the school administrator decided . to lose weight after seeing a picture of herself looking larger than she . liked with her work colleagues. She joined Slimming World and swapped sugary snacks and fast food for low-calorie mushy peas which she munches on twice a day. Incredibly, in just two years she lost 8st 6lbs and dropped eight dress sizes. She now weighs 12st 3lbs and has slimmed from a size 28 to a size 12 and 32in waist. Single mother of three Kim, from Carlton, Nottingham, said: 'I snack on mushy peas at least twice a day. I love them. 'If I'm hungry when I get home then I'll have some mushy peas before my dinner. 'I loved mushy peas as a kid, my dad . used to take me to a fish and chip shop every week and I would just have . these amazing mushy peas. The old her: She weighed 20st 9lb on a diet of . Greggs sausage rolls, crisps and chocolate bars but now fills her plates . with plenty of fresh vegetables . As she was: She shifted the weight by ditching . sugary treats and now she goes to Zumba classes three times a week and . goes to the gym at least once a week . 'So when I started this diet I found . some canned mushy peas, just little cans, and they taste just like they . did when I was a kid. 'So I snack on them when I feel . hungry at home, say before tea, as vegetables are free it means I am not . cheating on my diet and they fill me up. 'I decided enough was enough one day in 2011 when I saw a photo of me with some work colleagues. 'I was shocked, I was the biggest in the photo by a long way. I just thought, this can't go on.' Kim followed the Extra Easy diet . through Slimming World which encourages people to fill-up on salad, . vegetables and fruit rather than chocolate and sausage rolls. She added: 'Extra easy diet is basically where a lot of foods like potatoes and pasta are ""free"". 'So you could have a jacket potato . with chicken breast but the golden rule is that a third of your plate is . filled with ""super free"" food like salad, vegetables or fruit. 'That really works for me because . when I started I could have a large portion with a large side salad and . I've gradually cut my portions down. 'Before I could have three or four packets of crisps in the car on the way home from work. 'It was a case of ""no one's seen me eating them so it doesn't count"". 'I'd tried to do it before and failed because I wasn't in the right frame of mind. 'I went to the weigh-ins and said I wasn't cheating but I clearly was because I didn't lose the weight. And Kim says her children are delighted with her achievement. 'They are really proud, even with the older one who doesn't say much, you can tell. 'It nearly choked me up when my daughter gave me a hug and said she could fit her arms around me.' Lifestyle change: Kim was so shocked when she . saw a picture of her former 20st 9lb frame that she decided enough was . enough and she would lose the extra weight .

I didn't want my oldest to be embarrassed that I was his mum. 'To be honest I don't know what happened, this time something just clicked. I was focused and determined.

Slimming World leader Debbie Wilson . has been working in Nottingham for more than 20 years and says Kim is . the biggest weight loser she's had.

"A pregnant fourteen-year-old girl secretly delivered her baby with a pair of scissors in the family bathroom before throttling the boy to death and hiding the body in a shoe box. Cassidy Goodison, 14, has been charged as an adult with first degree murder after police learned how she killed her child following months of fearfully disguising her pregnancy from her mother and father. Her harrowing case has shocked even experienced officers and graphically illustrates the problems of the 750,000 teenage Americans who fall pregnant every year. Goodison went into labor in her home in Greenbrier Village, Florida on September 19 and instead of calling for help, disguised her screams of pain by running the tap and gripping a towel between her teeth as she sat on the toilet. Child killer: Cassidy Goodson, 14, is facing charges of first degree murder after she secretly gave birth to a baby boy, strangled him to death and then hid hid body in a pile of wet laundry . After prising the 9.5lb boy form her . body with a pair of  scissors, she felt for a pulse and then strangled the boy . to death and hid his corpse in a shoe box with dirty laundry. Three . days later, as Teresa Goodson cleaned her daughter's room, a foul odour . drew her attention to a pile of soiled, wet clothes in which she found . the deceased infant hidden in a box. An autopsy performed determined the victim was a full term infant and that he was alive and breathing prior to death. He died as a result of asphyxia from strangulation and blunt force trauma. Miss Goodson had gone to great lengths to hide the transformation of her 5ft 3in 100lb body during pregnancy, according to Polk County officials. Throughout the summer, as she walked around in baggy sweat pant and loose-fitting T-shirts. Members of her family grew suspicious of her appearance and attempted to discuss the possibility she was pregnant with the teen's mother. But Mrs Goodson denied the suggestions,  said the report, claiming that she had made her daughter do two home tests, albeit in the privacy of her bathroom, which both came out negative. Scene of the crime: Cassidy Goodson lives on this street in Greenbrier Village, Florida . Husband Timothy Goodson agreed meanwhile that he had noticed Miss Goodson's weight gain and that she had been walking around at home wrapped in a blanket. An interview with the teenager on September 22 revealed that after the 14-year-old had delivered the 9.5lb, 20.4in boy into the toilet, she had felt for a pulse and then strangled him to death. Confirming he was dead by once again checking his pulse, she then cleaned herself and the baby and tucked the evidence out of sight. Shortly after, however, Mrs Goodson noticed blood in the toilet she knew had been recently used by her daughter so took her to Lakeland Regional Medical Center. There medical staff treating the high school student told Mrs Goodson that she had suffered a miscarriage and showed four to five lacerations on her vaginal wall. Medical drama: After the teen's mother saw blood in the toilet shortly after, they went to Lakeland Regional Medical Center where staff believed she had suffered a miscarriage . Though these injuries were in reality self-inflicted when the teenager had pried the baby out of her with a pair of scissors, she falsely confessed to her mother that she had indeed had a miscarriage at home and flushed the fetus down the toilet by mistake. Polk County Sheriff's Office deputies, along with members of the Department of Children and Families responded to a call from the hospital reporting the case and details were retained by the PCSO Bureau of Criminal Investigations for follow up investigations. 'This is the most perplexing, confusing, disheartening case I've ever seen in my 18 years on this job' According to the Sheriff's Office affidavit, on the evening of September 22, at approximately 7.30pm, Mrs Goodson removed a bag of smelly, wet clothing from a storage stool in her daughter's bedroom. While sorting through the clothing she found the body of the baby concealed in the shoe box. In a panic, Mrs Goodson called her sisters who in turn alerted the police. Miss Goodson told detectives she was motivated to hide her pregnancy and choke the baby 'to stop him from breathing,' by the fear that her relationship with her parents would change if they found out the truth. Miss Goodson was arrested on Thursday and transported first to the Juvenile Assessment Center and then to the Polk County Juvenile Detention Facility. She is charged with Premeditated First Degree Murder, a capital felony and Aggravated Child Abuse, a first degree felony. Polk County Public Information officer, Donna Wood, told MailOnline: This is the most perplexing, confusing, disheartening case I've ever seen in my 18 years on this job. Everyone has been touched by it.'","Cassidy Goodison delivered boy in bathroom and strangled him .

"An Ecuadorian boy with a severe facial deformity is due to fly home from New York next week after going under the surgeon's knife ten times to fix a potentially fatal condition. Ten-year-old Kevin Rosero was brought to the U.S. in January by Blanca's House, a charity that works to improve access to modern healthcare. When he arrived for surgery at Stony Brook University Hospital Kevin could not speak English and he hid his face in a scarf so no one would see his lip. Life-changing: Kevin Rosero has had ten operations to fix a potentially fatal facial deformity thanks to charity Blanca's House . He was suffering from a 'massive venous malformation' that made it difficult for Kevin to eat, and the soccer fan had other medical issues that doctors feared could lead to blindness or even death, according to Long Island Newsday. 'It was hard for him, not only from a . functional perspective, but just knowing - looking at yourself every . day,' Dr Alexander Dagum said. 'So, it's a change, and now he's a normal, . good-looking boy with no functional issues.' Kevin is also pleased with his new look after the surgery, telling Long Island News: 'I look in the mirror and I look pretty handsome. They saved my life.' Dr Dagum fist met Kevin when he was . performing free surgeries in Ecuador, and realized the best chance the . boy had was to come to Long Island to be operated on. In the past year he has had surgery ten . times, and also had dental work done. Doctors explained that his abnormality had . affected his cheek, tongue, larynx and lips. Since he arrived in the U.S. Kevin has been living with foster parents Sheila and Brian Campbell. Mrs Campbell, a Blanca's House volunteer, said he attended elementary school and has become fluent in English during his stay. Transformed: Kevin used to hide his face behind a scarf but now he says he's 'pretty handsome' Care: Sheila Campbell has fostered Kevin since he arrived in the U.S. to be treated at Stony Brook hospital . Treat: The university soccer team gave Kevin a ball and let him sit on the bench for a match after hearing about his bravery . She said: 'He's the bravest boy I ever met.' On Friday, Stony Brook arranged a send off for the soccer-loving child, which included a chance to meet the hospital's team, who presented him with a signed ball, T-shirt and seat on the bench for last night's match. 'When we heard about Kevin's story, we were truly, truly amazed by the strength and the courage that he's shown - not just over the last eight months, but throughout the course of his life,' Seawolves coach Ryan Anatol said.","'I look pretty handsome now' Kevin Rosero says after 10 operations at Stony Brook hospital .

"The Honda Odyssey was the only minivan to earn the highest safety rating in new crash tests by the insurance industry. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said Thursday that the Nissan Quest, Chrysler Town & Country, and Dodge Caravan all garnered the lowest rating on the small overlap front crash test, which replicates what happens when a vehicle's front corner collides with another object at 40 miles per hour. In each of those cases, the minivans' structure collapsed from the force of the crash. CHRYSLER TOWN & COUNTRY . Tried and tested: The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said Thursday that the Chrysler Town & Country was one of the lowest rating minivans on a small overlap front crash test . Smash: The test replicates what happens when a vehicle's front corner collides with another object at 40 miles per hour . Hazard: In the Town and Country, the dummy's head slid off the air bag and hit the instrument panel - the legs also appeared to be trapped . In the Quest, both of the dummy's legs were trapped and the air bag was shoved up into its face, the institute said. In the Town and Country, the dummy's head slid off the air bag and hit the instrument panel. The Toyota Sienna earned the second highest rating of 'acceptable.' The institute said its structure was weak but the dummy was protected by its side air bags. Only the Odyssey won a 'good' rating. Its structure was damaged, but the dummy was protected from serious injury, the group said. The Arlington, Virginia-based institute introduced the small overlap test in 2012. NISSAN QUEST . Long-running model: The Quest is a minivan manufactured since 1992 by Nissan and is now in its fourth generation . Crumpled: The vehicle's structure was pushed in nearly two feet at the lower hinge pillar, and the parking brake pedal moved 16 inches toward the driver . Potentially fatal: In the Quest, both of the dummy's legs were trapped and the air bag was shoved up into its face, the institute said . This was the first time a group of minivans was tested, and the institute said it was surprised to see some of the worst outcomes possible for this type of severe crash. 'It's not encouraging that just 40 per cent of the minivans did acceptable or better in these tests. Especially when you consider how many people drive these vehicles,' Dave Zuby, executive vice president of the Insurance institute, told NBC News. Minivans are at a disadvantage because they are wider than the car platforms they're built on. That leaves large areas that are less able to absorb the force of a crash. Minivans are also heavier than cars, so the damage they inflict can be more severe. One other minivan sold in the U.S., the Kia Sedona, has not yet been tested. Kia is making a change to the vehicle that should improve its performance, the institute said. It will be tested in a few weeks. TOYOTA SIENNA . Verdict: The Toyota Sienna earned the second highest rating of 'acceptable' High-imact: The institute said its structure was weak but the dummy was protected by its side air bags . Protected: Here images from the wreckage show that the dummy remained intact, while the front bonnet was completely crumpled .

"Tthe Muslim convert - who threatened a caretaker because he let tourists into a mosque with their heads uncovered - hails from a devoutly Christian family . This is the face of the Muslim fanatic who made legal history as the first woman to go on trial wearing the niqab. Rebekah Dawson, 22 – whose refusal to remove the full face covering has caused controversy – is pictured here for the first time, dressed in a casual T-shirt. The image can finally be revealed after she dramatically admitted witness intimidation yesterday. Her guilty plea followed a six-day trial during which a judge controversially allowed her to wear the niqab after ruling that the court should recognise ‘freedom of religious expression’. Today it can be disclosed that the Muslim convert – who threatened a caretaker because he let tourists into a mosque with their heads uncovered – hails from a devoutly Christian family and started wearing the veil only as recently as 2012 after being radicalised by a ‘Muslim vigilante’. Pictures taken six years ago show her as a carefree teenager enjoying listening to music and dancing with her relatives. But just a few years later, she shocked family members by turning up at the funeral of her grandmother Delcie Dawson wearing a burka. Her great uncle, Gilbert Bell, said her Jamaican-born grandmother worked as a nurse at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and raised her family as strict Christians. ‘My sister Delcie would turn in her grave if she knew how Rebekah was carrying on,’ he added. ‘Delcie was very religious, a committed church-goer.’ Mr Bell’s wife Dorothy said: ‘I’m horrified and angry that a woman wants to put on an Islamic veil. That is like going backwards in women’s rights. I really can’t understand it at all.’ Dawson claimed her religion prevented her removing the veil in the presence of men . Brought up in a broken and violent household, Dawson had a chaotic childhood that may give an insight into her rejection of Western values. Born in South London in 1991, the jobless Muslim fanatic is the fifth of six children. Her father, Christopher, 54, was released from prison last year after serving a five-year sentence for trying to smuggle £100,000 worth of cannabis into the UK from Ethiopia. This week, Blackfriars Crown Court heard how Dawson had recruited her brother Matthias to help her frighten a caretaker at Finsbury Park Mosque in North London because he had let three Portuguese charity workers into the building on June 4 last year. Dawson refused to give evidence during a four-day trial with her brother Matthias, 32, after being ordered by the judge to remove her veil if she went into the witness box . She confronted caretaker Daudi Yusuf, saying: ‘Why are you inviting naked women in the mosque?’ A fight broke out after her husband Royal Barnes, 23, intervened. Terrified, Mr Yusuf reported him to the police. Two weeks later, Dawson returned to the mosque – where hate preacher Abu Hamza famously disseminated his poisonous beliefs – accompanied by her brother to challenge Mr Yusuf. She asked him: ‘Why did you tell the police my husband is threatening to kill you?’ This led to her trial for witness intimidation, during which she was allowed to wear her veil – to the fury of open justice campaigners. Judge Peter Murphy insisted she remove her niqab to give her evidence. She changed her plea to guilty today after a jury of six men and six women failed to reach a verdict against her and her brother . During the extraordinary case, Rebekah Dawson’s identity had to be verified by police officers throughout her trial. She was allowed to wear the veil, which showed just her eyes, after her barrister Susan Meek argued in a pre-trial hearing last September that she had a right to do so under the European Convention on Human Rights. It meant that a female police officer, who had been present when Dawson had her photograph taken after she was arrested last June, repeatedly had to go to a private room at Blackfriars Crown Court with the defendant – who would lift her veil to confirm her identity. Judge Peter Murphy originally said last September that Dawson would have to remove the veil before she even entered a plea to the single charge of witness intimidation. But he relented after Miss Meek cited human rights laws and said forcing Dawson to remove the niqab would be counter to UK’s ‘tolerant’ approach to Islamic dress. Judge Murphy ruled Dawson could wear the veil while sitting in the dock, however he claimed it was crucial for jurors to be able to see the defendant’s face if they gave evidence at trial. He said Dawson would have to remove the veil if she took to the witness box. But she waived that right during the trial, which meant that the jury did not see her face at all during the six-day hearing. During his summing up, the judge told the jury to put aside any prejudices that they may have about the niqab. He said: ‘This is not a ruling about religion. It is about the ability of the court to hear a fair trial.’ But Dawson’s lawyer attempted to . challenge his decision, arguing that forcing her to remove the veil to . give evidence violated her right to a fair trial. When . Judge Murphy rejected this challenge and invited her to remove the veil . in front of the jury of six women and men, Dawson refused. She later declined to give evidence, claiming it was against her religious beliefs to show her face to men. The jury were discharged at the end of the trial after failing to reach a verdict, despite deliberating for more than 12 hours. Facing the prospect of a retrial, Dawson admitted her guilt, but only after making a deal with prosecutors that the case against her 32-year-old brother Matthias – who was facing the same charge – would be dropped. Last night Dr David Green, director of think-tank Civitas, said it was wrong that Dawson had been allowed to wear the veil in court. ‘This really makes a mockery of the justice system,’ he said. ‘I do not think she should have been allowed to wear the veil at all during the trial. ‘It weakens the extent to which the court is doing justice because it’s not just a matter of looking at someone’s face when they  give evidence. ‘That’s an important part of the jury’s judgement and this may be why the jury was unable to reach a verdict in this case.’ Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society, wrote to the Ministry of Justice last year about the case. He said: ‘Justice can only be done where jurors can observe the demeanour of defendants and witnesses, not just when giving evidence but throughout  the trial. ‘The justice authorities must act quickly to make sure that this trial is not used as a precedent to permit full face veils. ‘We further regret the significant wasted court time on this issue.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Rebekah Dawson refused to give evidence during a trial with after being ordered by the judge to remove her veil if she went into the witness box .

"A young British designer is locked in a legal battle with Marks & Spencer after the store began selling framed wall prints that she says are almost identical to her work. Louise Verity, 31, has been creating framed pictures of large printed messages on top of old pages from a dictionary since 2009, selling them through her independent art business Bookishly. But the artist became alarmed when she learned that M&S had begun selling almost identical prints - using a similar font and with the slogans in the same position as her work - through its stores and website. Similar: Louise Verity's work (left) and (right) the Marks & Spencer version . She said: ‘At first, people were really pleased for me because they thought I’d been commissioned by M&S, but obviously I hadn’t.’ Taking inspiration from her love of words and books Mrs Verity says she collects quotes form classic literature, films, songs and ‘other wise old sources to print onto vintage book pages’. Describing her products as ‘literary gifts’, she said: ‘You’ll also find some vintage map prints, book page jewellery and greetings cards in the mix.’ The designer added: ‘It all started with an antique French dictionary and my grandfather’s set of water colours. ‘I still spend a lot of time hunting through old bookshops looking for inspiration and for books to give a new lease of life as a little piece of art.’ The prints are then mounted in frames supplied by her parent’s company, making the product very much family-inspired. Concerned that the High Street retailer had stolen her idea the designer, a married mother-of-one from Kettering, Northamptonshire, instructed solicitors who advised her M&S had breached her copyright. Success: Mrs Verity sold over 2,000 wall prints in the eight weeks leading up to Christmas 2013, priced at £24.75 each . Last night Mrs Verity told the Daily Mail: ‘I just wish Marks and Spencer had have commissioned me to do the work - that would have been amazing. ‘There are loads of brilliant small designers who could be doing that for them.’ A legal letter sent to M&S said: ‘The image posted on your Instagram site shows a substantially similar product. It is our contention that this is a substantially similar product. It is our contention that this is a substantial taking of our client’s work and hence an infringement of her copyright. ‘We therefore request that you immediately remove this image from your Instagram site, and any other location in which it may be available. We further request that you supply us with information regarding the producer of this infringing product.’ However the retail giant dismissed her concerns claiming her designs used a ‘common technique’. And in a fiercely worded legal letter, drafted by M&S solicitor Amarjit Purewal, branded her claim of breach of copyright as ‘unfounded’. Response: The retail giant dismissed Mrs Verity's concerns claiming her designs used a 'common technique' It said: ‘Whilst there may or may not be copyright subsisting in any particular work your client has produced, we do not believe that your client can claim a monopoly in the actual use of ‘over-laying’ printed words on dictionary pages. ‘It is our understanding that overlaying of typed words or other imagery on a background of a densely worded page from a dictionary, is not an uncommon design feature. ‘Accordingly, your client’s allegations of copyright infringement are unmeritorious and unfounded.’ Mrs Verity said she was not surprised by M&S’s response and acknowledged it would be a David versus Goliath fight if the case ever went to court. She said: ‘They must know it will cost me tens of thousands of pounds in legal fees to take this further with no guarantee that I’ll get the money back if I win. ‘My concern is that my business will suffer, including my mother, father and brother’s business, which I buy the frames from.’ Mrs Verity sold over 2,000 wall prints in the eight weeks leading up to Christmas 2013, priced at £24.75 each. M&S began selling their own wall prints in November last year, priced at £25.00 each. Last night M&S said it was no longer selling the framed wall prints, claiming the product had only been released as a ‘small buy’. The firm added it was trying to reach agreement with Mrs Verity. A spokeswoman said: ‘We take all claims of intellectual property infringement extremely seriously. ‘We’ve investigated this thoroughly and determined that the technique of overlaying text on print is a common design practice. ‘We’ve already been in touch with Bookishly directly and we’re happy to follow up with them if they have any questions.","Louise Verity, 31, creates pictures of text printed onto old dictionary pages .

"Workers digging an underground garage for a new hotel  recently struck something big about 30 feet below the surface. This week they uncovered it - a boulder that's thousands of years old and bigger than an SUV, weighing an estimated 150 tons or 300,000lbs. A geotechnical engineer who was called out to examine the giant rock in Everett, Washington. The rock, which weighs 150 tons and is bigger than an SUV was discovered in Everett, Washington. It is believed that a glacier left the 'erratic rock' there around 18,000 years ago . An excavator digs around a glacial erratic rock discovered at the Courtyard by Marriott construction site last Thursday and then fully unearthed on Wednesday . The  rock is bigger than an SUV and close to 19 feet long and 10 feet wide, The Daily Herald reported. Several drill bits were broken due to the rock. Geotechnical expert Kurt Merriman, told The Daily Herald  it's a glacial erratic - a giant rock left behind by a glacier. maybe 18,000 years ago. It is likely that the boulder traveled from northern Canada or Alaska, the engineer said. The site superintendent for the Halvorson Construction Group, Ben Hansen, said it may give the boulder to the city to try to find it a home. Work on the new Courtyard by Marriot hotel was suspended following the fascinating find. A glacial erratic is a piece of rock that is totally different from the size and type of rock in the area where it has been found. 'Erratics' are normally carried by glacial ice, often over distances of hundreds of kilometers. Glacial erratics can range from pebbles to one of the largest ever found in Alberta, Canada.

"Amid heightened fears about home-grown jihadists joining the conflict in Iraq and Syria, a new threat could be set to rock the nation. Police say Islamic extremists are teaming up with outlaw motorcycle gangs, using radical Islam as a justification to join the groups. The link  is a consequence of Australia's changing demographics, as well  the shifting cultural landscape in the wake of the Government's severe counter-terrorism measures. Members of the Mongols Motorcycle Club prepare to ride away from their clubhouse in western Sydney . New South Wales Assistant Police Commissioner Clive Small said there is a growing threat from homegrown Islamist radicals . Police raid and subsequent terror laws, which gave rise to a spate of hate crimes against Muslim Australians, have left many young men in these communities feeling disillusioned. New South Wales Assistant Police Commissioner Clive Small said the clubs give them an avenue to revolt against Australian authorities. 'You can have a person who says I'm in it (a gang), I'm selling drugs, because Australia's a bad place and we need to raise money to take over,' Mr Small said. In September, 800 police were involved in the largest counter-terrorism raids in Australian history, which authorities said thwarted a plot by militants linked to the Islamic State to behead a random member of the public. Severe counter terror-laws were brought in last month in a bid to foil youngsters going to fight in Iraq and Syria, where scores of Australians have joined militant groups such as the Islamic State. Police arrests a suspect in the nation's largest counter-terrorism operation in September , which saw hundreds of police raid homes in Sydney and Brisbane . (L) Another suspect arrested in the raids, and (R) a large curved sword inscribed with black foreign lettering was seized as part of the evidence found at a home in the suburb of Marsfield . But the link between Muslim Australians and bikie clubs goes back further than this. More than 25 years ago, Mark 'Ferret' Moroney joined the Finks Outlaw Motorcycle Club, members were like him: tough, covered in tattoos and, like much of Australia at the time, white. The gangs have since been transformed by an influx of members of Middle Eastern origin, some of whom do not even ride motorcycles. 'It changed the clubs' style a little bit. In the Mongol Nation you must have a motorcycle to be a member or to hang around,' Moroney, who defected from the Finks in 2013 to become national president of the rival, all-white Mongol Nation, said. 'Some other clubs are a bit lax with that rule,' the soft-spoken Moroney, with a shaved head, bulging forearms covered in tattoos and the word 'Mongols' inked across his neck, said in a rare interview at the club compound. Convicted murderer and Brothers 4 Life gang boss Bassam Hamzy adopted the mantle of radical Islam behind bars while ordering his gang to join forces with the Bandidos Motorcycle Club in a bloody drug war. Police say the gangs have since transformed by an influx of members of Middle Eastern members . The gangs now have strong family and cultural ties to the very communities police worry are harbouring potential radicals . The gangs now have strong family and cultural ties to the very communities police worry are harboring potential radicals. 'Those who are involved in criminal activity, what I'm worried about is they bring with them skill sets, contacts, ability to source materiel that may not be readily available in religiously extremist groups,' New South Wales Deputy Police Commissioner Nick Kaldas said. 'There is a wall, to some extent, between profit-driven criminality and extremism and I guess our concern is 'what happens if that wall fades or dissipates.'' In the 1990s, crime groups run by the children of Lebanese immigrants took control of Sydney's notorious Kings Cross neighborhood and alliances were forged with bikies, who police say are heavily involved in narcotics and extortion. As the syndicates expanded into Sydney's majority Muslim western suburbs, young men were needed to bolster the ranks, said Detective Superintendent Deborah Wallace. Bikie gangs had no choice but to open to non-whites. Nike Bikies' - so called for eschewing leathers and Harley Davidsons for designer jeans and Mercedes sedans-are a new type of motorcycle club member who does not ride a bike . Traditionally, these recruits went through a long probation before becoming a full member but the 'Nike Bikies' - so called for eschewing leathers and Harley Davidsons for designer jeans and Mercedes sedans - were in high demand. Pumped up on steroids and flush with cash and guns, they would often defect from one bikie club to a rival, unheard of in earlier days, sparking conflict. 'They were their muscle. And what's happened since is that lack of loyalty is causing a whole lot of problems,' Wallace said. Those problems included drive-by shootings, fire bombings and a 2011 brawl at Sydney airport that left one bikie dead. Outside the Mongols' clubhouse in a Sydney industrial park around a dozen motorcycles gleam in the sun. Inside, behind a thick steel door watched over by security cameras, dozens of burly members drink beer and eat chicken smothered in gravy from grease soaked white boxes. Pumped up on steroids and flush with cash and guns, the new breed of bikies often defect from one biker club to a rival, which is previously unheard of . Mark Moroney (C), National President of the Mongols Motorcycle Club, says Middle Easterners have larger families than white Australians, he said, and they bring relatives with them into the clubs . To Moroney, who denies involvement in criminal activity, the shift in bikie culture reflects changes in society. Middle Easterners have larger families than white Australians, he said, and they bring relatives with them into the clubs. 'If you've got 40 relatives compared to an Australian, who's got five, more people are going to come,' he said. In 2005, police thwarted a plot involving Australia's most wanted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf to blow up a nuclear power plant in New South Wales with rockets allegedly stolen by an army major, who sold them to a biker gang, which sold them to a Lebanese organized crime group, which sold them to radical Islamists. Kaldas, an immigrant from Egypt, sees a worrying pattern. 'For me, that was a classic example of the profit driven criminality and the religiously or jihadi motivated sort of violence working together,' Kaldas said.","Police say Islamic extremists are teaming up with outlaw bikie gangs .

"The first genetically modified meat and fish could be approved this summer. Authorities in the US are expected to grant approval to Aquabounty salmon, which has been modified to grow twice as fast as normal salmon. And experts trying to combat world hunger are calling on the British Government to back the use of GM farm animals on the dinner table here. Approved: U.S. authorities have given the go ahead for salmon that grow twice as fast as normal fish, paving the way for the Government to back the use of them here . The push into GM meat could see the production of giant pigs, hens that have only female chicks and cattle made disease resistant using genes from baboons. But the move will alarm critics of the use of GM technology who are still battling to block the expansion of genetically modified crops. Earlier breakthrough: Dolly the cloned sheep, which was developed by the Roslin Institute . Professor Helen Sang, GM animal expert at the Roslin Institute – where Dolly the sheep was cloned – insisted fears surrounding ‘Frankenstein’ foods can be overcome. Roslin scientists yesterday called on the Government to support the spread of GM into farm animals but admit there will need to be a change in attitude among British families and retailers. They say a new technique of gene editing allows precise changes to be made in animals destined to be eaten. Professor Sang said: ‘This is a very exciting time. We have GM animals that have qualities you can’t achieve through conventional animal breeding. ‘The problem with GM is that it is seen as mumbo jumbo magic. But if people can understand what the aims are and what we are trying to achieve then they are much more comfortable. ‘It is an issue for us that the supermarkets decided many years ago not to sell GM food. They will have to change what they do, which will be a challenge for them. Food production is an international business and so GM animals may become acceptable in other countries before it is accepted here.’ The US is expected to approve Aquabounty salmon in the next few weeks. It is produced by inserting a growth hormone gene and another gene taken from the eel-like ocean pout. The fish would be sterile and raised in vast tanks on land rather than in sea cages. Bruce Whitelaw, professor of animal biotechnology at Roslin, said the main priorities of animal breeding companies are to create disease-resistant animals and manipulate the gender of offspring. But Chinese scientists are also working on creating bigger, faster-growing food animals, he said. Dr Helen Wallace of GeneWatch, which campaigns to ensure any use of GM is in the public interest, warned: ‘GM fish escapes could pose a serious threat to wild salmon populations.’ An EU move to allow the use of GM animals and insects modified to help destroy crop pests ‘amounts to engineering whole ecosystems, and no one knows the consequences of this,’ she said. Pete Riley, of the GM Freeze campaign, said: ‘We can see no advantages from GM animals in either food production, pest control or disease control. ‘We know from in-breeding using conventional methods that this causes huge genetic problems which impact on the health and welfare of farmed animals.’","Aquabounty salmon set to granted approval in the U.S.

"Family doctors have been given detailed guidance on spotting cancer amid fears they are dismissing early warning signs as harmless. For the first time, GPs have been told to refer patients with seemingly banal symptoms, such as a cough or tiredness, for urgent tests within 48 hours. NICE, the NHS watchdog which has issued the guidelines, warns that delays in spotting signs of cancer is ‘costing the lives of thousands of people’ every year. The NHS watchdog NICE says thousands of lives are being lost every year by GPs not refering cancer patients for blood tests and X-rays soon enough, and has issued new guidelines . The UK has one of the lowest cancer survival rates in Western Europe and, for some types of the disease, it is even behind Bulgaria and Estonia. This is partly thought to be because GPs are not referring patients for tests when they show up with potentially confusing symptoms such as a cough, abdominal pain or tiredness. But experts also worry that patients are too stoical and do not want to trouble the doctor with what they assume is a minor ache or pain. The guidance urges GPs to refer patients for blood tests, scans or X-rays within 48 hours if they have certain ‘unobvious’ symptoms that may have a variety of explanations. These are persistent tiredness, bruising, bleeding, or fever in youngsters. They could be the first signs of leukaemia, lung cancer or brain cancer. In some circumstances, GPs must refer patients for hospital tests within hours. These include children who have woken repeatedly vomiting or with headaches. Professor Mark Baker, of NICE, said: ‘The problem is a lot of cancer symptoms can be very general and similar to those of other conditions. Unless it is a cancer-related sign or symptom we are very familiar with – a lump in the breast for instance – many people won’t think about the possibility of cancer. ‘It is not always easy for GPs to spot cancer either. There are more than 200 different types so it is unrealistic to expect them to know every single sign of each one, especially when they only see a handful of new cases a year. But early referral and diagnosis can help save lives.’ Figures have shown that a quarter of cancer patients saw their GP at least three times before they were referred for a test at hospital. Many have rarer cancers which their GP may only see a few times in their career. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt pledged in June to name and shame GPs with poor records on sending patients for cancer tests. Sara Hiom, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘These guidelines should give them more options to get patients referred quickly. But to be truly effective doctors need better access to diagnostic tests and speedy results.’ Doctors are being told to send patients with 'unbvious' symptoms which could have a number of explanations - such as a cough or fatigue - for cancer screening tests . The guidance came as it emerged that thousands of cancer patients are waiting too long to start vital treatment. Official quarterly figures revealed that for the third time this year the NHS has missed its target of ensuring at least 85 per cent of patients undergo surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or receive other drugs, within 62 days after being referred by a specialist. Over the last three months only 83.5 per cent of 33,404 were treated in 62 days. Some 5,519 waited longer. A third of hospitals breached the target, including some where just half of patients were treated in 62 days. Sarah Woolnough, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘These targets exist to ensure swift diagnosis and access to treatment, which is vital if we’re serious about having the best survival rates. ‘These breaches have become a trend and they are worsening.’","Doctors told to refer patients with 'unobvious' cancer symptoms for tests .

"A gaping sinkhole has opened up in the Perm region of Russia after the flooding of a nearby potash mine. The sudden collapse led to the suspension work at Solikamsk-2, owned by the world's number one potash producer. The hole - described as being between 100 and 130ft in diameter - appeared several miles to the east of the mine in Perm region. Disaster: Around 1,300 miners have been told to stay away from the Solikamsk-2 mine in Russia after a 130ft wide sinkhole opened up . Gave way: Some have theorised that an earthquake in the area 20 years ago may have weakened the rock, before mining and flooding caused it to subside . Geologists are urgently seeking to understand its cause. One theory is that an earthquake 20 years ago weakened the rock structure around the mine. Some 1,300 miners were ordered to stay at home as an assessment is undertaken into the safety of the flooded shaft. Workers in the mine were evacuated safely. The hole suddenly appeared several kilometres from the mine and is surrounded by 'dacha' summer houses. No-one was living in the homes close to the sinkhole, but many in the area are now concerned over further craters appearing in the area, linked to the flooding. One local said: 'People have not slept for three days, waiting for new holes.' Another stated: 'These are dacha houses in the pictures. They were empty when it happened, which was lucky. The nearest houses where people are living are two kilometres away. 'This hole appeared because the waters broke into the mine and the soil collapsed...there is almost panic in Solikamsk.' Collapse: Despite the ground around the mine giving way, all of the workers were safely evacuated . Huge loss: The Solikamsk-2 mine is owned by the world's biggest producer of potash - a chemical compound used in fertiliser - and may have to close as a result . A local estate agent said today residents were rushing to put their homes on the market after the sinkhole appeared on 18 November. 'The number of people who wish to sell their flat in the South of the city increased three times,' said Artem Bogushevsky, head of Khirsh agency. 'Our town has two parts northern and southern. There is really some kind of panic among the people from the southern part. They are trying to sell their flats now and move to other regions.' However, he warned new buyers 'do not want to invest into districts with potential risk for their lives'. The area is close to a notorious area of GULAG prisons in the Stalin era. The flooding is a blow to fertiliser giant Uralkali, which is traded on the London and Moscow stock exchanges. The company accepted there could be further 'subsidence', and linked the problems to an earlier mine flooding in 1995, which some blame on an earthquake. Dmitry Osipov, Uralkali CEO, said: 'The accident is not catastrophic to the company's operations or people living in the area. 'The impact is being localised and we have a clear plan to tackle the situation promptly. 'We will take all necessary measures to minimise the impact of the incident on the Company, our investors, partners and the inhabitants of Solikamsk and the surrounding area'. Solikamsk-2 mine is reported to have reserves of 150million tons amid fears that the mine will have to close. Uncertain: One bank estimates that the company could lose nearly half of its productivity to the collapse, putting thousands of jobs at risk . Aexander Baryakh, General Director of the Mining Institute of the Urals Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, said: 'The site where the inflow of brine has been detected completely overlaps with the site of the incident which happened at Silvinit Solikamsk-2 on 5 January 1995. 'This enables us to conclude that the 1995 accident and its consequences are directly linked to the accident on 18 November 2014.' But he insisted: 'There is currently no threat to the surrounding populated areas.' The plant has an annual capacity of 2.3million tons of potash, a crop nutrient. 'We estimate that up to 24 per cent of the company's capacity might be affected, with another 20 per cent of capacity in geographical proximity to the flooded mine,' said Renaissance Capital investment bank. 'We can not say that the mine is lost for the company,' said Dmitry Mazepin, the company's deputy chairman. The cause of the sinkhole is seen as different to the appearance of craters in northern regions of Siberia recently. The Siberian craters - in permafrost regions - are seen as the result of the melting of soil containing gas hydrates, leading to dramatic blowouts.","Huge hole opened up several miles to the east of a potash mine in Russia .

Builder Evo Ivanov told the Daily Mail: ‘The road was all closed off and there was a man lying in the road. ‘People were giving him first aid. ‘There were lots of plain clothed policemen around.’ Police refused to let patrons who had been eating and drinking at the Wealden Hall pub leave the pub car park, according to one witness. The unnamed policeman was hit by a gold Volkswagen Golf similar to this one (File photo) She said: ‘My son was in the pub at the time and the police weren’t letting anyone leave the car park.’ One pub worker, who asked not to be named, claimed police had been following the suspect ‘all day’ as part of a wider investigation.

"Admission: Lord Razzall with his partner, Baroness Bonham-Carter . A senior Liberal Democrat has revealed that he was approached dozens of times by wealthy supporters who offered £1million or more to buy seats in the House of Lords. In remarks that threaten a new cash for honours controversy, the party’s former treasurer Lord Razzall admitted yesterday he told business people who made such approaches ‘several times a year’ to ‘keep quiet’. The peer said he had advised would-be donors it would be against the law to sell an honour, but conceded there would be quasi-corruption in the political system until party funding is reformed. ‘In politics a lot of people particularly give big money because they want something,’ said Lord Razzall, who was in charge of Lib Dem finances for 12 years. ‘They either want to influence the party’s policies, or they want access to the leader, or in a lot of cases they want some sort of honour, which of course is a criminal offence. ‘Unless you restrict the amount of money that can come into the political process, you will always have quasi-corruption.’ Asked if he had been made ‘dishonourable’ offers, the peer told BBC Radio 5 Live: ‘Oh God, yes. ‘Anybody who has been a party treasurer of any of the three parties will tell you, if they are honest, that there are numerous people who came to you and said, “I will give you a million pounds as long as I can go into the House of Lords”. ‘There’s nobody to who that has not happened, and everybody knows what you have to say, which is, “I’m terribly sorry, that’s a criminal offence. Would you mind keeping quiet?”.’ Asked how often wealthy individuals attempted to buy honours over his 12 years as treasurer, Lord Razzall replied: ‘I should think several times a year. ‘If you were to ask the treasurer of the Tory party or the treasurer of the Labour party, and get them to be honest, they would say exactly the same.’ Under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925, it is a criminal offence to offer ‘any gift, money or valuable consideration as an inducement or reward for procuring or assisting or endeavouring to procure the grant of a dignity or title of honour’. But asked why he failed to report offers of cash for honours to police, Lord Razzall said: ‘I don’t think it’s an offence, no. ‘The offence would be to procure an honour for somebody in return for a payment. ‘All I can say is that a lot of treasurers would have to spend a lot of time at the police station if we had to report anyone who said that to us.’ Lord Razzall said he was approached dozens of times by wealthy supporters who offered £1million or more to buy seats in the House of Lords . Earlier this year former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott – who quit the party after being exposed as being involved in a plot to oust its leader Nick Clegg – also raised questions about donors. He complained that his efforts to ‘expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own’, had failed. Ken Ritchie, former chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: ‘This is further evidence that the Lords is a totally undemocratic body and the sooner we make it elected or scrap it altogether the better.’ Non-domiciled peers who do not pay tax in the UK were banned from peerages in 2010 under Labour, with cross-party support. But Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg’s plans to slash the number of peers from more than 800 to 450, with 80 per cent elected, was dropped after 91 Tory MPs rebelled and Labour refused to back the move. The original cash for honours scandal saw several businessmen who loaned money to Labour – which unlike a donation did not have to be declared – nominated for life peerages. A police investigation saw then prime minister Tony Blair questioned by detectives and Labour forced to repay the loans, although no charges were brought. It is a criminal offence to offer ‘any gift, money or valuable consideration as an inducement or reward for procuring or assisting or endeavouring to procure the grant of a dignity or title of honour’ (file picture) The Lib Dems have been heavily dependent on millionaire backers who have been made peers. Of all cash donations to the party in 2012, more than £600,000 – or 40 per cent – came from wealthy supporters who were subsequently appointed to the House of Lords by Mr Clegg. They include Ministry of Sound owner James Palumbo – now Lord Palumbo of Southwark – who has donated more than £500,000 to the party. And Domino’s pizza tycoon Rumi Verjee was made Lord Verjee of Portobello after handing over £770,000, some via his company Brompton Capital Ltd. There is no suggestion that any of the peers has done anything wrong. Party leader Mr Clegg has said businessmen are ‘perfectly’ entitled to give the Lib Dems large sums and it is unfair to suggest they should not separately be nominated for peerages. A party spokesman said: ‘The Liberal Democrats have robust procedures in regards to handling donations that comply with all legal requirements. ‘All staff involved in the process are aware of the rules and regulations surrounding donations and these are always made clear to the donor at the outset.’","Lord Razzall said he was approached several times by wealthy supporters .

"Veteran actress Sheila Hancock, 81,  has confessed she has started shopping around for an old people's home . SHE is as busy as ever and at 81 has no intention of putting her feet up. But Sheila Hancock is only too aware that time is not on her side and has confessed she has started shopping around for an old people's home. The veteran actress who last year starred in a musical and penned a novel, said if she develops dementia she would like to be cared for in a home. Discussing her age and the years that have gone by, she said: 'I have got to that age where I have got to think that I have only got a few years left. When you are past 80 you know you have about five years of active life or 10 years at the very most. 'You have to think seriously what you are going to do. I am not going to do any more long runs in shows. I want to be at home and do my own thing occasionally. 'I still like a drink but it is mainly on my own. You do begin to feel old when your daughter is 50 and my oldest grandchild is going to be 20. That is when you know you are getting near the end.' She then added: 'I am inspecting old people's homes. That is my latest mission. I don't want to be put into a nasty one so I am looking at all the old people's homes in the district saying 'I am not going to that one. I may go to that one. If I go senile I want to go to that one'. Miss Hancock made her comments during her appearance on ITV's Jonathan Ross show which will be shown on Saturday evening. Care of the dying is a matter close to her heart – she has opened two dementia wards, one run by Quakers in a psychiatric hospital in York and another in Portsmouth. She has also said in the past: 'I feel strongly that terminal care should be mandatory for every nurse and doctor. People are still dying badly.' Miss Hancock, whose 60-year career encompassed TV, film and theatre, last year starred in musical Barking in Essex and ensures that she stays in shape by doing yoga, pilates and swimming and walking everywhere. She told host Ross that these days she is not short of offers to work but finds most of the parts marked for her are either for characters who 'either get senile or die now or get shot.' And she revealed she once suffered from terrible stage fright when she was in Sweeney Todd and tried everything from hypnotherapy to drugs to cure it. She said: 'It is absolute terror. I get scared. When you are an actor you are afraid that you are going to forget your lines. I lost my nerve totally and then I went to a hypnotist and I used hypnotherapy. I have used it for giving up smoking and fear of flying. It works for me.' Asked if she had ever taken medication for her anxiety she added: 'I took pills like mad...uppers and downers but they did not work.' Miss Hannock made the revelation on ITV's Jonathan Ross show, which airs tomorrow . Miss Hancock was married to actor John Thaw, best known for his starring roles in The Sweeney and Inspector Morse. He died of oesophageal cancer in February 2002, aged 60. Miss Hancock has admitted in the past that Thaw was a depressive and alcoholic and as such it turned their marriage into a tempestuous one. And it appears she has no desire to find a replacement for Thaw – describing a date she was encouraged to go on by her friends, she said: 'I went out with this old guy. He asked me out. All my friends said 'Go on, make an effort'. I started doing the thing of being lovely and hopefully attractive and suddenly half way through I found myself thinking 'Have I put on the electric blanket?' 'I knew. I thought I have got to the age now where I am more interested in my electric blanket than some boring old git.' The mother of two told Ross she had developed a penchant for pop music and now has a fondness for Adele, Lily Allen and Noel Gallagher. But while she may be willing to embrace modern music, the modern face of Labour does not move her. Becoming the latest celebrity to express discontent with Ed Miliband's party she told Ross: 'I am a member of the party but I am a bit ambivalent at the moment. I could not vote for anybody else but I am a bit worried at the moment. We have got to vote whatever.'","Actress, 81, reveals she has been 'inspecting' old people's homes .

"It is not a region known for its promotion of equal rights for women. However, a 28-year-old woman from Dubai has struck a blow for her Arabic sisters after becoming a train driver for the city's Metro system. Not only is Mariam Al Safar the first female in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to get behind the controls of a train - she is also the first in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Inspiring: Mariam Al Safar urged women to think more about unconventional jobs when considering their career paths . 'Top priority': Miss Al Safar said her jobs had made her open to challenges and unafraid to take risks . Her feat is all the more impressive when you consider women are arrested in Saudi Arabia for driving a car. Miss Al Safar, a native Emirati, is one of a select few UAE residents qualified to get behind the controls of a Dubai Metro train - and is the only woman, it was reported. The network, which is described as the most advanced in the world is primarily an unmanned automatic driving system, which is operated from a centralised control room. However, in the event of system repairs or an accident, it needs manual operation. Miss Al Safar told Gulf News: 'I am always open . to challenges and I am not afraid to take risks. I work hard and my job . is my top priority.' She added: 'Being a train attendant . has helped me understand how to interact with people and staff from . different nationalities and different cultures. This has empowered me to . tackle different kinds of situations with ease.' One for the girls: While women in Saudi Arabia are banned from driving cars, Mariam Al Safar is the first lady in the Middle East to control a train . At the controls: Native Emirati Mariam Al Safar is one of a select few UAE residents qualified to drive the train . Pioneering: Mariam Al Safar at the controls of a Dubai Metro train, which is primarily an unmanned automatic driving system . She also urged more women to think more about unconventional jobs when considering their own career paths. She told Gulf News: 'Don't . live your life without a target or vision. Set a target and strive to . achieve it.' Dubai's large expatriate community accounts for 80 per cent of its citizens, making Emiratis minorities in their own country, so jobs like Miss Al Safar's are usually carried out by foreign nationals. However, in a bid to reduce the UAE's reliance on foreign labour and expertise, the Government is introducing policies to boost the number of Emiratis in the workforce. The Dubai Metro said it actively promotes the policy of employing of local Emiratis and claimed the number of locals working for Serco - the operator of the system - is almost 135, which is 12 per cent of the total workforce. The process of 'Emiratisation' is to be increased to push up this number to between 50 and 60 per cent by the end of 2014. In recent years, Dubai has seen an upsurge of young women overturning a traditionally patriarchal culture to find their feet in the workplace. The government drive to empower and educate women - along with exposure to westernised cultures - has resulted in the female population moving into a range of professions. Popular: Dubai's large expatriate community accounts for 80 per cent of its citizens, making Emiratis minorities in their own country . The UAE's stance on women's employment is progressive when compared with other countries in the Middle East. In Saudi Arabia, women can be arrested for driving a car. Several campaigns have been mounted . to overturn the ban, but there is still widespread opposition to . allowing women behind the wheel of a car. A report published in the Middle . Eastern kingdom last year claimed that allowing women to drive would . result in an increase of prostitution, pornography homosexuality and . divorce. Highly segregated: Women and men in Saudi Arabia are restricted in how they are allowed to mix in public . Women struggle to get around in Saudi Arabia, and it isn't just a result of the driving ban. Taxis can be sparse and some men refuse to drive a woman without a chaperone - usually their husband or a close male relative. In September, a woman in Jeddah named Shayma Jastaniah was found guilty of driving through the streets. She was sentenced to 10 lashes as a result of the charges despite holding an international driving license. Earlier this month Saudi . Arabia's government announced it will begin enforcing a law that allows . only females to work in women's lingerie and clothing stores, despite . disapproval from the country's top cleric. The 2006 law banning men from working in female apparel and cosmetic stores has never been put into effect. This is partly because of the stance . of hard-liners in the religious establishment, who oppose the whole idea . of women working where men and women congregate together, like malls. Women and men in Saudi Arabia remain highly segregated and are restricted in how they are allowed to mix in public.",Mariam Al Safar is only female qualified to get behind the controls .
"Weaving through walls of sweets, I feel like I have wandered on to the set of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. Display stands of M&Ms and Skittles stretch out in front of me as far as the eye can see. Vast bowls containing lollipops and bubblegum fight for my attention. One stand is heaving with Haribo - every kind of Haribo, in bumper bags. The effect of the multi-coloured wrappers in neat stacks stretching on and on is almost hypnotic. Scroll down for video . Like a child in a sweet shop... but Melissa's haul of goodies came from clothing store Next . But this is not a sweet factory, or even a sweet shop. This is clothes retailer Primark. I am queuing in its flagship store on London's Oxford Street to buy a top. But before you can purchase anything, the store forces you to snake through this maze of sugar, fat and E numbers. Elsewhere on Oxford Street, I found vast quantities of sweets by the tills in Topshop, River Island and Next. It seems highly ironic, and cynical, that the clothing stores catering to image-conscious young women are pushing sugary treats in such an aggressive way. The problems this practice could be exacerbating, or even causing, could not be more worrying as the country faces a worsening epidemic of obesity. In the UK, 64 per cent of adults are now classed as being overweight or obese. A huge increase in heart attacks, strokes and diabetes has been predicted by health experts unless this trend is turned around. Most worryingly, perhaps, the latest figures for 2012/13 showed that 18.9 per cent of children in Year 6 (aged ten to 11) were obese and a further 14.4 per cent were overweight. Why so many sweets in a clothes shop? The sweet treats in Next are 'seasonal merchandise aimed at the gift market' according to their spokesman . The problems caused by treats at the tills - the 'please Mum!' syndrome - sparked a massive campaign a few years ago by parents and health groups, with such pressure being brought to bear on the food retailers that a number of the big ones - including Tesco and Aldi - have said they will remove all chocolates and sweets from all their checkout areas by Christmas. But outside the supermarkets a new battle is raging, for which campaigners admit they were totally unprepared. The phalanx of calorie-laden nasties offered up by clothing giants makes the supermarket checkouts seem decidedly tame. What is happening in clothes stores is far more insidious, because these shops are not on the radar of the health officials, and the sweets are clearly aimed at adults. Take the message on Topshop's own-brand products, for example: 'You don't stop eating sweets when you get old. You get old when you stop eating sweets,' it declares. Clearly, a good deal of thought has gone into marketing these 'sweet treats', as they call them. A stand near the door is filled with giant jars and packs of Marshmallow Fluff, Reese's Peanut Butter Pieces, and Millions Strawberry Bits. Temptation: Oxford Street's Topshop store even has a cup cake stall . There's also a range called Gourmet Naturally. The packaging reveals that the Watermelon Sours in this range contain 28 calories and nearly five grams of sugar per sweet - that's over a teaspoon each. There's nothing natural about that. Move beyond this mountain of sugary gunk, and you find a display cabinet full of Lola's Cupcakes, with cakes iced every colour of the rainbow. But, surely, nobody goes to a clothes store to buy chocolate, sweets or cupcakes? So why put it in their minds? Malcolm Clark, of the food and health charity Sustain, says it's all about channelling the 'sitting duck' queueing at the check-out. 'Compared with five or ten years ago there is this whole range of non-food retailers who have taken on the profit-making idea of sweets at the checkouts, primarily in shops for teenagers. There is no excuse for it in clothes shops. It's really cynical.' Not for those wanting to fit into a skinny jeans: Melissa was amazed at how many sweets were on sale in River Island . And why pick the very worst kinds of sweets? In River Island, there are super-sized marshmallow bars which are so full of E numbers that they bear a warning on the back: 'May have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.' Somehow, I rather suspect they aren't much good for adults, either. Ploughing on, I head to Next, which I thought might be more restrained. But a stand by the checkout bears a polka-dot patterned 480g jar of chocolate and toffee popcorn and, for a second, I catch myself thinking it would look nice on my desk. The practice of selling food in non-food shops has been gaining pace for years. WHSmith made headlines in 2006 when David Cameron attacked it for promoting cut-price chocolate at the counter. But the store defended its actions and still forces customers to run the gauntlet of chocolate and sweets whenever you pay for a newspaper. Well-placed: The sweets are by the tills in Primark to tempt shoppers as they queue . It is arguably worse than most in that its staff are instructed to ask customers if they want the chocolate that is on special offer when they make a purchase. Even the self-service checkouts force you to press a button accepting or declining a chocolate or drink offer before you can pay and leave. It is especially shocking to see this level of sugar-pushing on the High Street after the supermarkets moved to stop the practice. Tesco was the first to remove sweets and chocolates from checkouts at its larger outlets way back in 1994 - and its smaller outlets are to follow soon. In January, Lidl banned confectionery from the checkout in its 600 British stores and replaced it with dried and fresh fruit, oatcakes and juices. What the clothes shops are up to is manipulative in the extreme. To understand how it all works, you have to consider the stress of finding then trying on an outfit on a crowded shop floor while pounding pop music assaults your ears. A sugar low is inevitable. And then there's the emotional factor. Teenagers and young women feel unprecedented pressure to look like their idols - either stick-thin like Kate Moss or with impossible curves like Kim Kardashian. Wonkers: This Primark display looks like something out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . There is nothing so depressing as the sight of a normal body trying to squeeze into the latest fashions in an unforgiving changing room mirror. A girlfriend of mine in her 20s, for example, tells me that she recently became so frustrated in Topshop she picked up a giant bag of Haribo while queuing. 'They get you when you are feeling terrible about your body because you can't fit into any of the clothes,' she says. 'I was trying to comfort myself, basically, while queuing up to buy something in a bigger size than I thought I needed.' In other words, while customers might buy the sweets, they hate themselves for doing it, and hate the stores for tempting - or indeed tricking - them. Double standards: While campaigns have been launched to stop sweets aimed at children being placed at supermarket tills, these sweets aimed at adults are allowed in clothing stores . Armfuls of junk: Melissa with sweets from River Island which they can sell with big margains . So why do the stores persist? One word: profit. Industry experts say the profit margins must be huge, although the stores are incredibly protective about the sales figures of these items. They know all too well, perhaps, that they may soon be on the radar of health campaigners and the Government. Another factor is the deals allegedly done by confectionery giants, some of whom may be paying the stores to place their chocolate bars and sweets in prominent positions. We asked all the retailers whose stores we visited why they sold sweets but only one, Next, replied. 'The reason we have more confectionery in store at present is because it is part of our seasonal merchandise aimed at the gift market,' its spokesman said. So what can customers do? You could leave one of Sustain's Checkout Challenge cards, available on its website, in a shop to let them know if you're annoyed with the amount of junk food on sale. 'The Government's focus has been on the stores selling food so those companies are engaged in a process. But the clothes stores are getting away with it,' says Malcolm Clark. Last night, a Department of Health spokesman said: 'We are delighted that stores such as Aldi, Lidl and Tesco are leading the way in removing sweets and confectionery at checkouts. We encourage other shops to follow their example in helping their customers to make healthier choices.'","Vast quantities of sweets by the tills in Topshop, River Island and Next .

"It was once the most stylish hotel in Aleppo, hosting the likes of former French leader Charles de Gaulle and novelist Agatha Christie. But the feted Baron Hotel has been forced to close its doors as the Syrian civil war grips the city, with the front line separating government and rebel forces just metres away from the building. Haunting photos of owner Armen Mazloumian sitting on the abandoned terrace and empty rooms in the once-grand hotel have emerged painting a bleak picture of life on the front line. Scroll down for video . The Baron Hotel, the oldest hotel in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, has been forced to close . Armen Mazloumian, the owner of the Baron Hotel sits at the terrace and reflects on the future . The lobby of the Baron Hotel still holds an element of class and distinction . The hotel was founded in 1911 by Mazloumian's grandfather, whose name it bears, and was once the fanciest in Aleppo, Syria's former commercial hub. In 1958, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser delivered a speech there. It was also at the Baron that Agatha Christie wrote parts of 'Murder on the Orient Express'. But since fighting arrived in the city in 2012, paying clients have dwindled to zero and the once-glamourous building is falling into disrepair. 'It's been nearly four years since the war began and I see nothing that inspires any optimism in me, quite the contrary,' says 63-year-old Mazloumian, unshaven and wearing a blue woollen hat. Aleppo has been divided between government control in the west, and rebel control in the east since shortly after fighting began. The conflict, which started with anti-government protests in March 2011 and has since spiralled into a brutal civil war, has ravaged large parts of the historic second city. The reception has struggled to cope with reservations - or more, a lack of them . The conflict, which started with anti-government protests in March 2011, has since spiralled into a brutal civil war . The war has ravaged large parts of the historic second city hitting local businesses and tourism . Mazloumian is the last of four generations of Armenian hoteliers in Aleppo in his family. His great-grandfather Krikor opened the family's first hotel, named Ararat after the mountain revered by Armenians, in the second half of the 19th Century. In the Baron's lobby, on a yellowing wall, an advert from the 1930s can still be seen. 'Hotel Baron, the only first-class hotel in Aleppo,' it proclaims. 'Central heating throughout, complete comfort, uniquely situated. The only one recommended by travel agencies.' The reception hall is in a state of decay, with no hope of ever being restored to former glories . The telephone booth is dusty and outdated, emphasising the true effects of war . Nowadays, it's a different story. Everything inside seems outdated and dusty -- the reception hall, the telephones, the polished wooden bar with empty liquor bottles. The roof has been perforated by incoming shell fire, with water leaking inside when it rains. Rooms that once hosted celebrities and political leaders are empty, or home to a handful of displaced families who have been allowed to take refuge in the hotel. The hotel is not far from the Aleppo Museum, which has been closed since the war began, and near the rebel-held Bustan al-Qasr district. 'You think all this will stop? It will take years,' Mazloumian says over the sound of gunfire. It's a world away from the hotel's glory days of glitterati. An old car belonging to Armen Mazloumian, the owner of the Baron Hotel, stagnates outside . The key to the presidential suite at the Baron Hotel, where guests such as Charles de Gaulle stayed . Many of the hotel's rooms are forever linked to the famous guests who once stayed in them -- Room 201 was that of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, while Room 215 was where King Faisal I of Iraq and Syria stayed. Lawrence of Arabia stayed in Room 202 and Christie preferred Room 203 for her visits. 'I met her in 1959, but I was too young to know why she was important, I only learned that later,' said Mazloumian. 'She came every year with her husband, the archeologist Max Mallowan, who did excavations at Chagar Bazar and Tell Brak' in northeastern Syria.

'There were so many famous people who came here that if I started listing them all for you I wouldn't finish before tomorrow morning,' he said, ticking off names like billionaire David Rockefeller, former French leader Charles de Gaulle and aviator Charles Lindburgh. 'But this is all in the past now. Honestly, the hotel will never go back to how it was,' Mazloumian sighed, stroking Sasha, his black terrier.

"A food company is planning to house hundreds of students from Romania and Bulgaria in caravans because it can’t recruit domestic workers. Staples Vegetables, which supplies some of the country’s leading supermarkets, has angered locals by announcing it will pitch dozens of caravans near Boston in Lincolnshire. The firm has been given council permission to expand its on-site accommodation to take on more EU student labour because of an ‘inability to recruit from the indigenous population’. Staples is planning to extend on-site accommodation in Boston, Lincolnshire. Pictured, workers harvest vegetables in a field in Suffolk . Staples employs up to 378 students and this could rise to 650 in the peak season. The company is based on the outskirts of the village of Wrangle, just nine miles north of Boston, which has experienced a higher population percentage increase of new arrivals from Eastern Europe than anywhere else in the UK. Tensions in the town have made Boston a key Ukip target, with a recent poll suggesting 46 per cent of residents would vote for the party in the May’s General Election. Staples was given approval by Boston Borough Council to make its current 63 on-site caravans and amenity buildings permanent, while adding a further 52 caravans. The students are hired for up to 126 days through the Harvesting Opportunities Permit Scheme and are paid at least the adult minimum wage. The company’s planning statement says it suffers an ‘inability to recruit from the indigenous population’, but adds Lincolnshire ‘still thrives because foreign students visit the area to work’. The statement accuses agency staff of being ‘often unreliable and unmotivated’ and says Staples has to regularly retrain and induct new personnel. The foreign students, however, are employed directly by Staples. Managing director Vernon Read said: ‘We feel that employing people directly is a better system than relying on agency workers – it allows us to give better training and get much more continuity in the workforce.’ Two years ago, Staples said it received just 11 applications for 130 jobs which were advertised locally. But speaking outside Boston’s Jobcentre, one unemployed man, who would only give his name as Ed, said employers seemed to be looking for East European workers. He added: ‘It is very hard to find work in Boston unless you go to one of the agencies who seem to prefer East Europeans. ‘I know people say the locals won’t work but that is wrong. The arrival of all the migrants has changed the jobs market so people are taken on in bulk through the agencies.’ A Boston cab driver added: ‘I’ve got three children of my own and it is difficult for them to get work since all the East Europeans arrived. I don’t think attracting more and putting them in caravans is the answer.’ Tensions in Boston have made the town a key Ukip target.

"SNP MP Angus MacNeil has written to Scotland Yard asking them to review new evidence of attempts to 'buy' a seat in the House of Lords . The MP who sparked the original ‘cash for honours’ investigation last night demanded a new police probe into claims that wealthy Lib Dem supporters had offered money to the party in an attempt to ‘buy’ seats in the House of Lords. On Wednesday the party’s former treasurer Lord Razzall admitted he received such approaches from business people ‘several times a year’ but instead of reporting them he simply told them to ‘keep quiet’. Last night SNP MP Angus MacNeil wrote to Scotland Yard asking them to review the new evidence, and insisted Lord Razzall had a duty to name the individuals to the police. Mr MacNeil, who made the 2006 complaint about Labour’s efforts to secure peerages for wealthy individuals who had loaned the party money, said the peer’s comments amounted to a ‘smoking gun’. He said: ‘Lord Razzall has to tell the police who these people are and then the police have to talk to them and take it from there. ‘It’s very straightforward really. This is not so much the smoke from a smoking gun as the actual gun itself.’ His call was backed by the former Westminster standards watchdog Sir Alistair Graham. Sir Alistair, who chaired the Committee on Standards in Public Life said: ‘He has a civic responsibility to report people who are attempting to break the law. ‘I suppose the reason that people don’t report it because they are hoping to get donations all the same,’ he told the Telegraph. ‘If they have made an offer, by my understanding, they have broken the law. I suppose in each case, you would want to ask, did the parties receive a donation from these people anyway? The Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 makes it an offence to offer ‘any gift, money or valuable consideration as an inducement or reward for procuring or assisting or endeavouring to procure the grant of a dignity or title of honour’. But Lord Razzall, who was in charge of Lib Dem finances for 12 years, appeared to think only actually giving someone an honour was a crime. In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live was asked if he had been made ‘dishonourable’ offers. He replied: ‘Oh God, yes. ‘Anybody who has been a party treasurer of any of the three parties will tell you, if they are honest, that there are numerous people who came to you and said, “I will give you a million pounds as long as I can go into the House of Lords”. He also said the treasurers of both Labour and the Tories would say the same. ‘There’s nobody to who that has not happened, and everybody knows what you have to say, which is, “I’m terribly sorry, that’s a criminal offence. Would you mind keeping quiet?”.’ Asked how often wealthy individuals attempted to buy honours over his 12 years as treasurer, Lord Razzall replied: ‘I should think several times a year. Lord Razzall told BBC Radio 5 Live that wealthy people approached him regularly looking to buy peerages . Mr MacNeil complained to Scotland Yard earlier this year after comments made by former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott - who quit the party over a plot to oust Nick Clegg. Lord Oakeshott said, ‘my efforts to expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own, and help get the Lords elected have failed.’ Mr MacNeil said he was still waiting for a response from the police to that complaint. He added: ‘The Met need to review this new evidence, which highlights the depths of corruption in our second chamber. ‘Under the Westminster system, we have the ludicrous situation that there are far more legislators who are appointed than elected - and people in Scotland elect only 4 per cent of the Westminster parliamentarians who hold powers over the economy, welfare, defence, our place in Europe, and many other crucial areas of policy. ‘While the Liberal Democrats concede the House of Lords is out of date and undemocratic- they continue to stuff it with cronies. Labour are no better- they say they want a Senate but they continue to stuff the House of Lords with their own peers. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ‘We are not aware of any of the specific conversations Lord Razzall discussed. ‘As he made clear, any attempt to bribe a political party, and pay for a peerage is illegal. These are points he has previously made before select committee hearings, echoed by treasurers from other political parties.’ ‘As the Labour cash-for-peerages scandal proved, anyone engaging in this activity should face the full force of the law.’","SNP's Angus MacNeil has written to Scotland Yard calling for action .

"A Labour MP's wife whose popularity soared after she posted a string of selfies of her cleavage online has hit back at Twitter trolls who called her fat – by claiming the abuse motivated her to lose half a stone. Karen Danczuk, 31, who is married to Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk, 47, today uploaded two photographs of herself to Twitter with the caption: 'Can I please thank my trolls for calling me fat, I've lost over half a stone & feel fantastic KD #lastlaugh.' It comes after a tweet posted by the 31-year-old mother of two on November 15, in which she said: 'Anyone who calls me fat are a disgrace. It's no wonder girls become anorexic. If I'm fat at a size 10 God help us. KD.' Scroll down for video . Karen Danczuk, 31, who is married to Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk, 47, today uploaded two photographs of herself to Twitter claiming she had lost over half a stone after receiving abuse over her weight . Mrs Danczuk, 31, took to her Twitter page today to 'thank  trolls' for motivating her to lose over half a stone . Critics have attacked Mrs Danczuk's pictures but she has continued to claim they 'aren't supposed to be sexy' The social media lover has posted dozens of photographs in recent months, mostly of her cleavage, and about 60 images alone since the beginning of July. The Rochdale councillor's 'selfies' have attracted national attention and she has gained more than 25,000 followers since uploading the steady stream of images. Critics have attacked Mrs Danczuk for her pictures but she has continued to address criticism and has claimed the photos 'aren't supposed to be sexy'. Earlier this year, she said: 'I'm not an attention seeker. I don't roll out of clubs drunk. I'm not silly. I'm not a crazy party animal. I'm not a girly girl and I rarely wear make-up. In fact, I'm quite a tomboy. 'Not all my tops are low-necked. I don't wear short dresses — all my dresses are knee-length. Gosh, I've seen more flesh in the supermarket than I have in my photos.' In August, she was forced to defend herself after becoming embroiled in a bitter row with former Tory MP Louise Mensch - over the pictures of her cleavage. On November 15, the councillor uploaded this image to Twitter blasting those who criticised her weight . Mrs Danczuk has posted a string of 'selfies' on Twitter over the last few months, mostly featuring her chest . She has gained more than 25,000 followers on Twitter and has posted more than 60 racy photos since July . Mrs Mensch described the councillor in her newspaper column as 'Westminster's most embarrassing wife'. The former MP, who moved to New York with her music manager husband Peter after stepping down from Parliament, also said: 'She can't stop posting pictures of her cleavage on Twitter, cheapening women in politics.' However, Mrs Danczuk hit back at the claims and accused Mrs Mensch of being 'obsessed' with her chest and called on her to stop 'b****ing' about other women in politics. She also claimed her husband – who she owns a deli with in Rochdale - was proud of the attention she received, something which he reiterated by reposting one her online tweets with the caption: 'Proud of my wife — brains and beauty!' The pair married in 2012 and have two sons together, Milton, six, and Maurice, four. Mrs Danczuk is married to Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk, 47, and the pair have two children .","Karen Danczuk claims jibes about her weight motivated her to slim down .

"Gillian Weatherley - who was one of the officers present when Andrew Mitchell clashed with police in Downing Street sparking the 'Plebgate' scandal - gave evidence at Mr Mitchell's libel case today . A WPC at the centre of the Plebgate row who later claimed she could ‘topple the Tory government’ was yesterday accused of telling the High Court ‘a pack of lies’. Gill Weatherley was the first police officer to stop MP Andrew Mitchell from cycling through the main gates that evening. Her colleague PC Toby Rowland then intervened and claims the former chief whip called officers ‘f****** plebs’ when he was forced to use the pedestrian gate. Two days later Miss Weatherley sent a sick friend a text saying: ‘This will make you feel better. I’m the officer that stopped the chief whip leaving Downing Street on Wednesday. He didn’t swear at me but [at] Toby that let him out the side gate. I could topple the Tory government.’ A month later the police marksman sent a text to her builder saying: ‘I’m at the front gates [of Downing Street] tomorrow so I still have time to bring the government down.’ She claims the messages were meant to be sarcastic. Miss Weatherley was dismissed for gross misconduct in April after a Scotland Yard disciplinary panel examining the leaking of information found her to be a ‘thoroughly dishonest witness’. Giving evidence at the Plebgate libel trial yesterday, she was accused of telling the ‘same pack of lies’ by James Price QC, representing Mr Mitchell. ‘The truth is that you were intent on doing some damage to Mr Mitchell and the Government, weren’t you?’ he said. Scroll down for video . Mr Mitchell (left) is suing for libel over claims he branded Downing Street police 'f****** plebs'. Pc Toby Rowland (right) is in turn suing Mr Mitchell after he accused him of fabricating his allegations . Miss Weatherley denied that was the case and said she did not even know who the MP was when she confronted him in Downing Street. She claimed she was ‘somewhat surprised and shocked’ when PC Rowland told her that Mr Mitchell had called the officers ‘f****** plebs’ who should know their place. The following day Miss Weatherley sent a copy of PC Rowland’s account of the altercation to James Glanville, another officer in her squad. PC Glanville was later sacked for passing a photograph of PC Rowland’s email to The Sun newspaper. He had told her he wanted to read the email to see if the stories he had heard at work had been exaggerated, the court heard. Miss Weatherley said PC Glanville told her he had deleted the email and she did not suspect him to be the source of the leak. When she heard he had been arrested she told her chief superintendent what had happened. The disgraced officer was also accused of speaking to PC Rowland on the phone for 22 minutes in the aftermath of the incident to ‘get their story straight’. CCTV from the day of the clash shows Mr Mitchell cycling towards the gates, which are guarded by police . She said the conversation was simply a ‘sort of welfare’ chat because of the press attention the pair were receiving. Mr Mitchell is suing News Group Newspapers, publishers of The Sun, over the allegation that he called officers ‘plebs’ during the altercation in September 2012. Mr Mitchell denies using the word, but admits saying ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us’. News Group Newspapers argues its article was substantially true. PC Rowland is suing the MP for suggesting that he made up the allegations. The case continues.

"Britain’s net value has doubled in less than two decades to a record £7.6trillion, it emerged today. The total wealth is equivalent to £119,000 for every person or £289,000 for every family in the country. And we are a nation of homeowners, with the value of houses accounting for almost two-thirds of the entire net worth of the UK. Since 1997 the total net wealth of the nation has risen from around £3trillion to £7.6trillion in 2013 . The eye-watering sums were revealed in the latest National Balance Sheet, published today. It shows that the total value of everything in the UK more than doubled between 1997 and the end of 2013. The value of Britain has risen steadily every year, with the exception of the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009. The ONS said: ‘At the end of 2013, the UK was valued at an estimated £7.6 trillion, an increase of 4 per cent (£324 billion) from 2012, which continued the long-term upward pattern.’ Homes and charities were worth £8.46trillion alone, with the debts of businesses and the government reducing the total national wealth . The value of non-financial assets, which range from houses and cars to cattle and fine art, rose by £343 billion, while net financial assets and liabilities decreased in value by £19 billion. The combined wealth of households and non-profit organisations such as churches, charities and trade unions was a net £8.5 trillion, up from £7.6trillion in 2012. This was equivalent to an average of £320,000 per household. By far the most valuable assets in this sector were houses, worth £4.7 trillion. The value of properties have steadily increased in value in recent years, except for a decrease in 2008. In 2013 their value was estimated at £4.7 trillion, over three times their estimated value in 1997 (£1.4 trillion), without removing the effects of inflation. Between the end of 1997 and the end of 2013, the average house price increased by 234 per cent. The value of other buildings - including warehouses, roads, railways, pipelines, bridges and sports stadiums - increased by £86 billion (5 per cent) to £1.7 trillion. Machinery, transport kit and ICT equipment rose in value by £14billion to £814billion. The value of central government has fallen dramatically in recent years to -£633billion in part caused by rising national debts . Elsewhere insurance, pension and standardised guarantee schemes were worth £3.1 trillion while cash and savings were worth £1.4 trillion. Growing national debt means wiped £158billion off the value of the UK, the amount that the government owes more than it owns in assets. Central government net worth has fallen every year since 2001. Without removing the effects of inflation, central government’s estimated net worth was minus £663 billion at the end of 2013, a decrease of 0.2 per cent on the previous year and over eight times less than its net worth in 2006 (£82 billion).","Nation's total wealth is equivalent to £119,000 for every person .

"An Indian woman's parents have strangled her to death after claiming she destroyed their family's 'prestige' by marrying a man from a different caste, police say. The tragic death of Bhavna Yadav, a 21-year-old student from a leading New Dehli University, appears to be the latest of a series of cruel honour killings that have shocked India. Police allege Bhavna was strangled by her parents and uncle because she had secretly married 24-year-old Abhishek Seth in a union that undermined their family's 'prestige'.

Bhavna (pictured) went back to her parents' home to sort out their differences after she married a man from another caste . Abhishek is  Punjabi, while Bhavna was Yadav, from the Rajasthan region. She told her parents day after the couple secretly married. Under the auspices of sorting out their differences, her parents Jagmohan and Savitri Yadav then invited her to come home. It was during this stay she was beaten and strangled. After killing their daughter, the parents took her body to their village in Alwar, Rajasthan, where they set it on fire, police said. Abhishek told NDTV: 'I never got any indication of course that her parents would do this. If I had any inkling, I would have never sent her back home. 'Six months ago, I called her parents and told them about us - they told me: ""You are Punjabi, stay away. We are Yadavs. This won't work"".' Jagmohan and Savitri were arrested on Tuesday and sent to judicial custody by a Delhi court - although police are still hunting Bhavna's uncle, who is suspected of being complicit in the murder. 'The accused have been charged with murder, but we are investigating if it is a case of honour killing,' a senior police official said. Abhishek (right) claims he was told by Bhavna's (left) parents to 'stay away' and that the relationship 'won't work' Police are now searching for Dhavna's uncle, who they say was involved in the killing.

"Archie Collicutt, 18, has been jailed for ten years after he admitted raping or sexually assaulting seven underage girls including one as young as 12 . A teenager who attacked seven underage girls before threatening to kill them and their families to keep them quiet has been jailed for ten years. Archie Collicutt, 18, befriended the Oxfordshire girls before sexually assaulting them, including one victim who was just 12 years old. The attacks all took place between March 2012, when Collicutt was aged just 16, and September 2013 when he was finally caught. Collicutt was jailed today after admitting rape, sexual assault, sexual activity with a child and  attempted rape of a child under 13 at Oxford Crown Court. In March 2012, aged just 16, Collicutt raped a 13-year-old girl and said he would kill her and her family if she told anyone about it. In another incident in June 2013, Collicutt attempted to rape a 12-year-old girl and again threatened her and her family to stop her telling police. The teenager, from Wilcote Riding, Finstock, was eventually arrested  in September 2013. Detective Constable Ian Gibbard said: 'Collicutt deliberately took advantage of young girls, abusing them and threatening them in order to stop them telling anyone. 'We are pleased he took the opportunity to plead guilty and spare the victims from having to come to court, but that in no way makes up for what he did to them. 'I would like to take this opportunity to commend their bravery in coming forward to tell police what had happened to them. 'We will always take any allegations of sexual offences seriously and so I urge anyone who is a victim of offences like these, or knows someone who is, to get in touch and we will help in any way we can.'

"A 64-year-old Pennsylvania woman who has said she sold marijuana to help raise several grandchildren after her daughter died has been sentenced to 15 to 30 months in state prison. The Valley News Dispatch reported Candace Kelly was also ordered Thursday to cough up $75,000 for fines, and appear December 1 at a prison. Kelly entered guilty pleas last month for drug selling charges, according to the newspaper. Grandmother: Candace Kelly, 64, has said the funds she made from selling drugs were used to raise her multiple grandchildren . Drug selling: Police say Kelly bought large quantities of marijuana at $3,300 per pound and resold it at a profit of $100 per pound . It is believed by investigators that Kelly sold up to 100 pounds of marijuana a year for more than four years, The Valley News Dispatch reported. State police seized $393,000 when they raided her Buffalo Township home last fall. Police also seized 64 pounds of hydroponically grown marijuana. The newspaper reported that police seized 2 pounds of hallucinogenic mushrooms as well as roughly 2 pounds of hashish - plus 'drug pipes, items used to package the marijuana, a marijuana grinder, digital scale, and papers showing the extent of her drug trafficking.' The Pennsylvania State Police, as well as the Pennsylvania State Attorney General's drug task force, are set to get the majority of Kelly's hefty funds -- which she assented to handing over at the October plea hearing, The Valley News Dispatch reported. She has said the funds were used by her to support her grandchildren. Police say Kelly bought large quantities of marijuana at $3,300 per pound and resold it at a profit of $100 per pound. 'Legalize it man,' Kelly told CBS Pittsburgh in January 2014. 'If I can make that kind of money, why can’t the rest of Pennsylvania wise up? 'I never got on Welfare, I never drew anything from the system, I raised all my kids on my own. That’s my only crime.'

"The former Marine convicted of sexually abusing his two children will spend the rest of his life behind bars, after receiving two life sentences in Florida court today. U.S. District Judge Roy B Dalton Jr. called what 26-year-old Jonathan Adleta did to his children 'heinous', saying he is reposible for 'the destruction and scarring of his own children'. During the trial it was revealed that Adleta started planning to abuse his children before they were born, telling his pregnant girlfriend Sarah Adleta, 29, that he would only marry her if she allowed him to have 'daddy-daughter sex' with their child. Sick plan: Sarah Adleta, 29, was convicted of sexually abusing her two children with her ex-husband Jonathan Adleta, 26.  During her ex-husband's trial, she revealed that their plan to abuse their children started before the two were born . The abuse started when their daughter was born in March 2009, and the two were married the following year. They went on to have a son together, and the parents sexually abused both children. Soon after getting married, the two broke up but the abuse continued over Skype and with visits to Adleta in OKlahoma where he already had a new girlfriend. Girlfriend Samanatha Bryant, 23, had a daughter and she let Adleta abuse her as well. Enabler: Adleta's new girlfriend Samantha Bryant, 23, allowed him to abuse her daughter as well. She is serving a 15-year sentence consecutively with a 30-year sentence . Both women testified during Adleta's trial, shedding light on the gruesome abuse. During that trip to Oklahoma in December 2012, Sarah let her ex-husband abuse her daughter in his bedroom while she watched. The toddler 'seemed very resistant and 'really upset' the mother testified, leading her ex-husband to suggest she find another man for the child to have sex with so she wouldn't be 'freaking out' in the future. The Adletas horrifying and despicable sexual abuse of their own children was only uncovered when FBI were tipped off when the mother sent naked pictures of herself and the toddlers to a man in North Carolina. The mother performed sex acts on her children so the man could watch, according to testimony she gave the court this week. Sarah Adleta was sentenced to 54 years in prison in October for abusing her children. The Adleta children have since been put up for adoption. Adleta's girlfriend Bryant faced seperate charges herself, and was found guilty on two counts of lewd molestation. She was sentenced to consecutive 15- and 30-year sentences. Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen Gable called Adleta's crimes 'despicable and egregious' and said he is a 'grave danger to children'. Horrifying: Jurors heard despicable details of the sexual abuse of two young children in Orlando federal court (pictured) Despite that, Adleta's defense said consideration should be taken in for Adleta's military service in Afghanistan. The judge disagreed, saying what he did brought 'dishonor to the Marine Corps'. Adleta's former father-in-law Leonard Lippy, asked the judge to 'make sure he never touches another child again'. Lippy has no contact with his grandchildren who are being put up for adoption. 'He gets time but it didn't rbing my family back,' Lippy told the Orlando Sentinel after the hearing. 'You're going to tell me two life sentences makes this right?'","Jonathan Adleta, 26, was given two life sentences for sexually abusing his two children .

"The story of  the greatest escape of World War II has been told for the first time. The audacious breakout saw dozens of Allied prisoners of war scale the wire at a camp deep in Nazi Germany using four huge ladders they had made and disguised as bookshelves. During the breakout 32 prisoners got out and legendary pilot Douglas Bader, who was a prisoner in Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, described it as the most daring escape of the war. One of the ladders  laying across the fences the day after the escape on August 31 1942, photographed by German camp guards . It was overshadowed by the famous tunnel Great Escape which was immortalised in a Hollywood film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. But a new book describes the incredible breakout two years earlier and pays tribute to the unsung heroes behind it. They were led by Major Tom Stallard, a charismatic 37-year-old from Bath, Somerset, who was one of the most determined escape artists in captivity. After repeated failures with tunnels - which camp guards kept finding - he decided to go over the wire. He initially planned to get 250 men out but in the end had to settle on 40. A young Scottish lieutenant, Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, then came up with the idea of making the folding ladders to scale the twin 12-foot high perimeter fences, which stood six feet apart. Major Stallard launched Operation Olympian, so-called because it was an international effort involving men from all over the Commonwealth, which took five months to plan. The 2nd Battalion Durham Light Infantry (pictured) in September 1939  - Major Tom Stallard is third from the right on the front row . The ladders were made of two 11ft long sections, each with seven rungs which would open and form a right-angled bridge up and across the fence. The wood was plundered from a hut the vengeful camp guards had wrecked after finding yet another attempted escape tunnel. The first ladder was made in the camp's music room where the prisoners had relatively free rein and the sawing and hammering could be hidden by the sounds of instruments. The two sections were stood against the wall and disguised as new shelving units and filled with sheet music and other literature. They even fooled the despised camp's chief security officer, Hauptmann Rademacher, who inspected them and praised them for being well made. In the meantime the prisoners had discovered how to short the perimeter floodlights thanks to an electrical fault deliberately left by forced labourers who built the camp. Maurice Few's hand-drawn map of the section of camp where the plan unfolded - it shows the planned routes of the four escape teams . As the ladders were built, a forging department dubbed 'Thomas Cook' produced the documents the escapees would need. They were led by RAF Flt Lt Gilbert 'Tim' Walenn, an ace forger who was the basis for Donald Pleasance's character in The Great Escape film. Walenn took part in the real Great Escape from Stalag Luft III in 1944 and was among the 50 executed in cold blood on Hitler's orders. Zero Hour for the escape was set for 9.30pm on August 30 1942 and 40 Allied prisoners gathered in two huts near the perimeter. Each man carried 12lbs of food to last him between 18-21 days, plus washing kit, tinned cigarettes, basic medical kit, spare socks and underwear. Maps were made on very fine tissue paper and compasses were smuggled into the camp in Red Cross parcels by MI9, the specialist 'escape' arm of military intelligence in London. The lights were knocked out and a short distance away two homemade grappling hooks left hidden by the wire were pulled by unseen hands to distract the nearest sentry, who was standing 50 yards away. Two white painted ladders had been left leaning against the fence, adding to the bluff and a stream of fake orders were shouted in the air by two German-speaking British officers. Another view of the ladders left behind by the prisoners and photographed by German camp authorities the day after the escape . At the same time, in the music room other prisoners were gleefully playing instruments as loudly as possible to add to the general confusion. The diversions worked perfectly as the four 10-man teams darted from the huts carrying their ladders ‘like firemen’, and hit the fence. Four men quickly erected the ladders and locked the 'bridge' section in place and the teams poured over the wire. Unluckily, ladder number four collapsed after just two men had managed to climb over, but the other three ladders worked like clockwork and in just 40 seconds a total of 32 men were free. Belatedly, the guards realised what was happening and began shooting into the dark with their rifles and machine guns. Incredibly, just one Allied prisoner was hit by the hail of bullets, when one ricocheted into his heel  - but it failed to stop him. Six of the escapees were quickly recaptured, but by dawn 26 PoWs were free. Back in the camp, in cheeky reference to the Allies' narrow escape from Dunkirk a year earlier, a sign had appeared against the ladders: 'Another British evacuation.' Jock Hamilton-Baillie's identity card from Colditz Castle, where he was sent following the Warburg Wire Job and Eichstatt Tunnel . Of the 26 escapees remaining, just three successfully had a 'home run' and got back to Britain via Spain. They were later awarded the Military Cross and have all since died. Author Mark Felton, a military historian, said: 'The escape itself was one of the first mass escapes and the to my mind the most daring of the war. 'What struck me was the nature of it - the sheer audacity of it. 'This was slightly suicidal - the idea of charging the wire and running into the night - and rather unique. 'If the distractions hadn't been so successful it would have ended in disaster and a great many of the prisoners would have been shot. As it was, 32 made it over the wire.' He added: 'This kind of escape could really only be done once. 'Later in the war the Germans were more inclined to shoot those who were recaptured, as they did with the Great Escapers.' 'Zero Night, The Untold Story of World War Two's Most Daring Great Escape', by Mark Felton is published by Icon Books.","Daring escape code named Operation Olympian took five months to plan and allowed 32 Allied prisoners escape .

"A woman whose fiance watched her fall to her death off a 25-metre cliff during a camping trip was imprisoned for threatening to kill a former lover. Campbelltown couple Paul Veitch and Megan Moody were at the popular swimming hole, Mermaid Pools near Tahmoor, south-west of Sydney, when the 38-year-old plunged to her death on Tuesday night. It has now emerged Ms Moody had threatened a past employer she had sex with once, saying she would 'take to [him] with a f***ing knife' in a text message, and was sent to prison for 10 days over the incident in 2007, The Daily Telegraph reported. Scroll down for video . Campbelltown couple Paul Veitch and Megan Moody were at the popular swimming hole, Mermaid Pools near Tahmoor, when the 38-year-old plunged to her death on Tuesday night . The couple had been engaged for two months when Ms Moody slipped while collecting water with a billy can . Ms Moody had previously worked at a real estate agency in Geelong before her move to Sydney and was fired from her role in 2009. When this happened, she sent more than 160 text messages to her former employer, with one reading: 'You know this is ending in death, don't you?' In another, she wrote: 'You give me a dead grandmother and I'll give your parents a dead son. Either way, I'm going to kill you.' The man who these messages were directed at filed an apprehended violence order (AVO) against Ms Moody in 2010, but she breached it. Mr Veitch tried to revive her after he made his way down the cliff  and found his fiancee's unconscious body . When she was unresponsive, he made his way back to their campsite and called for emergency services . Ms Moody was also questioned three months ago over the stabbing of Mr Veitch but was not charged. In August, an AVO was applied for in Campbelltown Court to prevent Ms Moody from living with, stalking or assaulting Mr Veitch and safeguard him. The couple had been engaged for two months when Ms Moody slipped while collecting water with a billy can about 8.30pm two days ago, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Mr Veitch, 36, tried to revive her after he made his way down the cliff to the isolated spot and found his fiancee's unconscious body. When she was unresponsive, he made his way back to their campsite and called for emergency services. Police are still trying to determine what led to Ms Moody's death - whether she had lost her footing or she had jumped, according to News Corp. On September 4, Mr Veitch announced his engagement to 'Meg' on Facebook after being together for just six months and said she had made him 'real happy'. 'I lashed out and offered to marry her,' he wrote. 'Geez it felt good when i got told to bugger off nar jokes the ring fit an she said yes woohoo my meg rules hah anutha 9 day in paradise party on (sic).' Three days later after the engagement, Mr Veitch - who listed his occupation as a prawn trawler -posted a selfie of him and Ms Moody smiling at 'a cool little pad up the mountains'. Police said Ms Moody's death appeared to be an accident but they were still investigating the matter . Police will prepare a report for the coroner . The couple had been planning on spending the night at Mermaid Pools with police warning people to be careful when camping near cliffs. 'Just a general warning to people who are attending these sort of areas of a night time - particularly if people are intoxicated,' Inspector Michael Bright told ABC Radio. 'There's no lighting, it's quite a high area - there's a lot of cliff face around it and there's also no mobile service so if something goes wrong it's an area where you're not going to get a quick response from emergency services.' Police will prepare a report for the coroner.","Peter Veitch and Megan Moody were camping south-west of Sydney .

"Their fur flying and their paws stretching out behind them, these clever photos appear to show pet dogs posing in mid-air. German photographer Julia Christe captured the mid-leap snaps, which include a range of breeds, among them huskies and Chinese Crested Dogs. To create the shots, the dogs were dropped onto a mattress by their off-camera owners from a low height, with extra drama created via the use of a wind machine.

An adorable husky shows off its best side (l) and a Spitz dog flies through the air (r) The project came around after Ms Christe, from Tettnang in Germany, decided she wanted to portray her favourite animal from an new perspective. Although she never planned to become a pet photographer - despite owning two Spanish water dogs herself - Ms Christe found herself working on commercial animal shoots and so her passion for pet portraits began. Her latest project, which saw more than 100 canines visit her Berlin studio, is called Freestyle and includes photos of Boxers, Griffon Nivernais, Bearded Collies and Australian Shepherds among many others. 'The dogs were dropped by their owners onto a mattress from as low a height as possible, and the impression of flight was enlarged by wind machines,' explained the 41-year-old.

'Not every dog is born to fly, but some had great talent and became proper shooting stars.Some breeds like greyhounds didn't like it as they were afraid of being lifted, but other dogs such as the spaniel had a lot of fun. 'Some of the dogs had so much fun, we were even able to repeat the jumps. The expression on their faces mostly reflects the surprise of the first flight, and in most cases the first jump provided the best pictures.' Not everyone likes her work however, with Ms Christe revealing that she has been contacted by animal rights organisations, voicing their fears about the dogs' welfare. 'I have various reactions to my pictures, from fascination and astonishment to fears from animal rights activists,' she added.

"If you see a $100 bill on your windshield, it might not be an early Christmas present, authorities have warned. In fact, it could be a scam encouraging you to get out of your car to grab the bill - before lurking thieves jump into your running vehicle and speed off. Although the Maryland Assistant Attorney General said she has not seen such a scam in a police report, a resident informed her of one incident during a public information safety session, she said. 'But because it's something of a frightening nature, if this happens to someone, we hope they will take the proper precautions,' Karen Straughn told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Beware: Authorities have warned of a holiday scam where someone sees a $100 on their windshield and gets out of their car to retrieve it. Waiting thieves then jump in the car and take off . She added that there is also the added danger of children being in the car if this scam occurs. The Baltimore County Police Department's auto theft task force added that while it has not seen the $100 bill scam yet, they have noticed similar ploys. 'We have seen incidents where auto thieves will bump the back of someone's car in traffic,' a spokesman said. 'When everyone gets out of their cars, a thief will jump in the victim's car and drive off.' And those aren't the only scams that authorities are warning drivers about this holiday season. Among them, Straughn warned that scammers will approach a motorist and ask if they can prepare small dents in their car for a set amount, such as $200. But after the job is finished, the motorist might drive away and find they did a bad job or the scammer might actually demand a much higher sum. Warning: Announcing Maryland's new consumer protection office, state Assistant Attorney General Karen Straughn said motorists should be aware of scammers working in parking lots over the holiday period . In one incident, a scammer actually drove the motorist to the bank so they could get out the money, Straughn said. But that offender was reported and caught. 'Don't just accept business or items from people who approach you in a parking lot who want to sell you something,' she said. 'You should check out a business before you decide to pay them money.' Another scam reported in Baltimore County  involved a suspect yelling for help in a mall parking lot and when someone approached to give them help, the suspect tried to grab them. 'During the holiday season, the scams ratchet up tremendously,' Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler told WTOP. The state has now opened a new consumer protection office in Prince George's County, where people can report scams and learn hot to avoid them. 'Having this office here and available to help people navigate getting some of their money back, or all of their money back, is going to be a great thing for the people of Prince George's and Montgomery counties,' Gansler said.",The Maryland Assistant Attorney General has warned motorists to be aware of scammers operating in parking lots over the holiday period .

It takes Katie, who is flanked by her father and physiotherapist, around three minutes to get from start to finish. As she takes each step, hundreds of teary spectators watch on. The newlywed told WAFB News that she was 'nervous the whole way' and 'shaking so bad.' 'At first my legs got caught up on one another so that was a challenge,' she added. Prior to her big day, Katie went through months of intense and, at times, painful rehab. Look of love: It takes Katie, who is flanked by her father and physiotherapist, around three minutes to get from start to finish - As she takes each step, hundreds of teary spectators watch on . Mike Barwis, a renowned sports trainer featured in the Discovery Channel TV show American Muscle, was the man responsible for getting her in shape. When she first started physical therapy sessions, Katie had braces from her chest down. But the ones she wears now start just above the knee. She also has rods and plates in her spine, to hold her vertebrae in place. 'It's 90per cent mental,' she said of her battle to walk again. Bad news: Breland suffered severe burns and was told that she will never walk again . Special goal: Katie has been training with her coach for months so she could take her first steps when she walks down the aisle . Wreckage: Breland missed a stop sign on her way to work and her Nissan was broadsided by a truck . 'You just have to believe in yourself enough to say, ""No, I don't accept this. I'm not gonna remain in the chair, and I see bigger things for my life.""' Katie's accident occurred in October 2011 when she missed a stop sign that was turned sideways. A truck hit her Nissan broadside and she flew through the windshield and across the road, landing in a ditch. Her car landed on top of her. It took an emergency crew 33 minutes to extract her from beneath the engine. Severe burns covered three-quarters of her body and two vertebrae were shattered. Katie was in the hospital for 100 days and had many surgeries, including skin grafts and a surgery where rods and plates were placed to hold her back together. But the strong, athletic young woman who has spent most of her life playing sports, was determined to regain use of her legs. She became even more determined to get moving again after Odie proposed in December 2013. 'I told my sister, I said ""I will not get married until I can walk down the aisle, and I won't have it any other way.""'Kate recalled. She and Odie met around three years ago when a mutual friend introduced them before her accident. The couple lost touch but then reconnected. Small steps: Mike Barwis, a renowned sports trainer featured in the Discovery Channel TV show American Muscle, was the man responsible for getting her in shape . Fan base: When she's not training herself, the brunette helps others keep fit at her own gym, Katie’s Shed . On the go: Katie had several dress rehearsals to practice walking in such a big dress as opposed to gym shorts . Describing the moment he saw his blushing bride walking up the aisle in September, Odie said: 'I was just so proud of her. In my mind I'm just encouraging her, ""C'mon baby, c'mon baby, you got this.""' Katie had several dress rehearsals to practice walking in dress as opposed to gym shorts. When she's not training herself, the former runner helps others keep fit at her own gym, Katie’s Shed. The certified personal trainer holds classes there several evenings each week and also works individually with clients. Katie said she is thankful for the support she’s received from the Bogalusa community, with countless people following her progress and participating in fundraisers and events for her. True love: Last December, Katie  got engaged to Odie Hughes, whom she met three years earlier . She said she knew from the time of her wreck that she wanted to make the best she possibly could of the situation. About a year ago she decided she was ready to share her story, and since that time she has had several speaking engagements each month. She has also started a charity called Katie's Cause. Though it has been a testing few years, Katie said the wreck has changed her life in good ways, too. ‘It’s humbled me. It’s made me see things through completely different eyes,’ she concluded. Now she and Odie will be gearing up for their first Christmas together as husband and wife.","Katie Breland Hughes, 27, from Louisiana, was on her way to work in 2011 when a truck slammed into the vehicle she was driving .

"Poor performance by Network Rail is leading to thousands of extra cancellations and delays for millions of passengers as more than one in ten trains run late, rail watchdogs ruled today. 'Too many people are facing too many delays', said Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) chief executive Richard Price. Train service performance is 'generally below expectations' said the watchdog in its assessment of Network Rail's performance for the period from April to October 2014. And the data that Network Rail relies upon to plan and manage works on the railways is often 'unreliable' and could be preventing it from hitting its targets, said the ORR. The Office of Rail Regulation found Network Rail's poor performance led to thousands of extra delays and cancellations between April and October . Rail unions said Network Rail was 'failing millions of passengers.' In the six months from April to October passengers faced 46,545 more late trains in England and Wales than had been expected or allowed for. In Scotland the figure was 2,730 more late trains than expected; . Across England and Wales there were 18,544 more trains cancelled or severely disrupted in than expected. Punctuality levels at 89.1per cent are 0.7percentage points short of the level expected. The watchdogs said Network Rail was making progress on its own two-year performance recovery plan but warned that this was not having the desired effect on punctuality. Network Rail had also reported delivering less work than it planned to do, in both maintaining and renewing the network. There was a lack of reliable data on bridges, structures and earthworks as well as volumes of work being delivered and this was having an adverse impact on Network Rail's ability to work effectively. Rail unions said Network Rail is 'failing millions of passengers' despite massive investment . Failure to make sufficient progress on the early stages of some improvement work cast doubt on its its ability to deliver more ambitious enhancements. Mr Price said: 'This is vital as too many people are facing too many delays. It is the biggest source of dissatisfaction with the railways, and the industry needs to tackle the problem'. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: 'Despite massive investment by the taxpayer, £38billion over the next five years, Network Rail is failing millions of passengers, with more than 10per cent of services regularly running late. They need to up their game, especially when you take into account that those long-suffering passengers are paying the highest fares in Europe.' Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: 'If the hundreds of millions of pounds bled from our railways by the vultures from the private train companies was invested back into infrastructure we would be able to modernise and expand our railways up to a level that could meet surging passenger demand. 'All the time that our rail network is seen as an open door to a fast buck by greedy speculators reliability and safety will take a back seat. The answer is to end two decades of profiteering and exploitation and return to an integrated and publicly-owned railway run in the public interest.' Publishing its own review of its performance - covering April to September 2014 – Network Rail admitted its passenger train performance was 'behind plan'. The company added: 'There are clear improvement strategies in place but these will take time to have an impact on Britain's network, which is seeing continued growth in passenger numbers.' The watchdog said that some of the data Network Rail relies on to plan works on the railways is 'unreliable' Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne said: 'The railway continues to see strong growth in passenger numbers. 'However, we know that there are too many passengers that do not get the level of reliability they have a right to expect and that this has a real impact on their daily lives.'","Train service performance is 'generally below expectations,' said Office of Rail Regulation .

Hate messages: Father Marian Rajchel said he started receiving the text messages after carrying out an exorcism on a teenage girl . 'The author of these texts is an evil spirit who has possessed her soul', he said. 'Often the owners of mobile phones are not even aware that they are being used like this. However, in this case it is clear.' Father Rajchel claims that the devil and his followers were not shy about using modern technology but that in many cases their actions were not identified as being the work of evil. One of the text messages, the Austrian Times reported, read: 'She will not come out of this hell. She’s mine. Anyone who prays for her will die.' He replied, and was then sent another message in return: 'Shut up, preacher. You cannot save yourself. Idiot. You pathetic old preacher.'

"The fiance of a woman who watched her fall to her death off a 25-metre cliff during a camping trip was the victim of a domestic stabbing incident in August. Campbelltown couple Paul Veitch and Megan Moody were at the popular swimming hole, Mermaid Pools near Tahmoor, south-west of Sydney, when 38-year-old Ms Moody plunged to her death on Tuesday night. Three months ago, Ms Moody was questioned by police over the stabbing incident but not charged, the Daily Telegraph reported.

The couple had been engaged for two months when Ms Moody slipped while collecting water with a billy can about 8.30pm, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Mr Veitch, 36, tried to revive her after he made his way down the cliff to the isolated spot and found his fiancee's unconscious body. When she was unresponsive, he made his way back to their campsite and called for emergency services. Police told Fairfax Media Ms Moody's death appeared to be an accident but they were still investigating the matter. '[There were] no arguments before.

"The city of New York has been paying $200,000 to store a homeless woman's possessions, even though it would have been cheaper to have rented her an apartment. Andrea Logan's things have been locked up since she lost her Upper East Side apartment in 2006 after a debilitating stroke. Ever since, the city has been picked up the tab at the cost of New York taxpayers. New York state law requires it to cover storage expenses for homeless people. The city of New York has been paying $200,000 to store Andrea Logan's belongings. The 54-year-old former model has been homeless for eight years and suffered a stroke just before things took a turn for the worse . Logan, 54, had 11 storage units stuffed full of belongings ranging from 'hundreds of cartons of books,' as well as furniture, appliances and women's clothing, in the years after her stroke. According to the New York Post, officials didn't notice the huge tab until it reached $3,585 a month last year. For the same kind of money, a one-bedroom duplex in Greenwich Village could easily be rented or a large two-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side. Cumulatively, Logan's storage units total more than 1,000 sq feet - which is more than a number of Manhattan apartments. After the extortionate spending came to light, the city refused to fund the rent any longer, prompting her to sue in Manhattan Supreme Court. Now Logan has agreed to have a clear-out and cut down belongings so that they fit into just three storage units at a facility in The Bronx for $1,297 a month. State law mandates that the city pay for storing furniture and personal belongings for homeless people 'so long as eligibility for public assistance continues and so long as the circumstances necessitating the storage continue to exist.' Logan ran an antiques business before the stroke left her legally blind, however she does not know the value of all of the items she has stashed away. 'There's so much stuff that I wouldn't even know where to begin,' she told The Post. 'The most critical and valuable things are the irreplaceable items — documents from medical-malpractice and personal-injury cases, personal family documents, photographs and mementos.' Whilst the city is continuing to pay her way when it comes to storage, the former model says she hasn't lived in a city shelter for four years and is now staying with friends or even squatting in abandoned buildings.","Amanda Logan, 54, was left homeless after suffering a stroke .

"Most people see chores as a complete bore but some savvy entrepreneurs have turned signing up for all kinds of odd jobs into a thriving six-figure business. The latest trend to come from the wonderful world of the internet is people advertising a task that they either don't know how to do, don't have the time to complete or simply would prefer to outsource. Some keen taskers have found the odd jobs business so lucrative that that they thrown in their careers to concentrate on completing chores for other people as a full time occupation. People post a job on the website Airtasker with the price attached that they are willing to pay - and then a secret bidding war decides which person gets the gig. Daily Mail Australia looks at some of the more peculiar chores that people have taken on to make some big bucks: . Scroll down for video . Daniela White has been earning up to $1,500 a week from odd jobs advertised on the website Airtasker. Her husband, Phil, is quitting his job as a caravan builder so they can start earning at least double that amount . Daniela White has been earning up to $1,500 a week since August and is on such a winner that her husband, Phil, is quitting his job as a caravan builder so they can start earning at least double that amount. 'I get so many requests that I don't get enough time in the day to do all of them,' she said.'I've had to knock some back because I haven't had time to put in an offer.' The 37-year-old Melbourne resident has done it all from charging $100 to sew scout badges on five blankets for a family and reviewing a phone app for a restaurant. But the most surreal job Daniela has signed up for is pretending to be a man's partner for a timeshare holiday presentation for an hour and a half. 'He didn't want his partner to know because it was a surprise for her but he needed to have a partner to get the freebie holiday voucher,' she said. 'We had a blast and I made $50.' Rod Armstrong has been a handy man at a Bondage parlour which filled with whip, chains and harnesses . A former software engineer, Rod Armstrong, 60, took on ageism and won by doing chores for others and is now earning a tidy sum. 'Nobody gives a technical job to anyone over 30 anymore, so when I got sick of being rejected I tried Airtasker,' he said. 'My first job was moving two chairs 3km from one house to another for $75. It was such easy money and I was hooked.' The Sydneysider has been paid for all sorts of odd jobs including installing an iPod connection to a 1933 valve radio and fixing furniture in a bondage and discipline house. 'I didn't know what the business but I was taken into a dark room and asked to wait for the lady who was with a client,' he said. 'I had to wait for 15 minutes and I figured out pretty quickly that I was in a dungeon because there were whips, chains, harnesses, masks, feathers and red velvet on the walls.' He has been back to the business several times to do a variety of tasks including painting walls, plumbing jobs and refitting doors. Assembling furniture for people is a chore that Rod has taken on regularly. 'It doesn't surprise me that people want to pay for their furniture to be put together because it requires patience,' he said. 'It's easy to screw things up.' It's not uncommon for Rod to turn up to a job and have to disassemble the piece and literally start from scratch. 'A man once tried to put together a Dyson vacuum cleaner and when I turned up he gave me a bucket with all of the parts - people just give up.' Rod has fixed at least a dozen doors across Sydney which have been knocked down - much to his amazement. 'Some people say they had to get in because they had a child locked in the bathroom and others have been drunk when they got home at night and can't get in,' he said. 'I always evaluate whether it's worth the money, taking into account petrol prices and travel time, but I've managed to make a decent living for a while now.' Dee has been paid to pick up and deliver a parrot and also buying a crocodile bathmat from IKEA . Dee Papworth was stressed out working in income protection and decided to take a break for a couple of months ago to work out whether to return her job or have a complete career change. The 40-year-old started to do a few odd jobs a couple of months ago and is now earning a minimum of $1,000 week. She said she could be earning a lot more but was restricted by sharing a car with her partner and also holding down a part-time job. But the Melburnian said she is planning to resolve these roadblocks and will then be well on her way to earning at least double what she makes now with the six-figure mark becoming a highly achievable target. 'One of the most unusual jobs I have had is picking up a parrot that a uni student had bought and looked after it for six hours before dropping it off to him,' she said. 'It was quite funny because it would start squawking really loudly every time I walked into the room.' 'I also had to pick up a crocodile bath mat from IKEA for a man's child.'","Assembling IKEA furniture is a popular chore on Airtasker website .

"The $30 billion U.S. National Institutes of Health blamed tightening federal budgets on Monday for its inability to produce an Ebola vaccine, but a review of its grant-making history in the last 10 years has turned up highly unusual research that redirected precious funds away from more conventional public health projects. The projects included $2.4 million to develop 'origami' condoms designed with Japanese folding paper in mind, and $939,000  to find out that male fruit flies prefer to romance younger females because the girl-flies' hormone levels drop over time. Other winners of NIH grants consumed $325,000 to learn that marriages are happier when wives calm down more quickly during arguments with their husbands, and $257,000 to make an online game as a companion to first lady Michelle Obama's White House garden. The agency also spent $117,000 in taxpayers' grant dollars to discover that most chimpanzees are right-handed. Scroll down for video . No southpaws: The NIH spent more than $700,000 to find out that most chimps are right-handed, and that those with the best communications skills are also the best poop-flingers . NIH chief Dr. Francis Collins said a lack of research dollars in the past decade has hampered the search for an Ebola vaccine – but his budgets are higher now and NIH already funds some unconventional stuff . 'Virtual Sprouts' is a 'web-based gardening game' based on first lady Michelle Obama's White House garden; the quarter-million-dollar project is aimed at teaching nutrition and fighting obesity . The same group of scientists determined, at a cost of $592,000 for NIH, that chimps with the best poop-throwing skills are also the best communicators. But while flinging feces might get another primate's attention in the wild, they discovered, it's not much good in captivity. 'I've never in my life seen a chimp be given a banana for throwing s**t at someone,' Emory University psychologist Bill Hopkins told Wired magazine. The marital-argument research, conducted at Stanford and Northwestern Universities, involved 82 couples and found that when wives 'downregulated' their negative emotions during a spat, both partners had 'greater marital satisfaction over time.' Not so for men who held their tongues, however. Part of a $666,000 NIH grant supported a University of Buffalo researcher who determined that watching sitcom reruns like 'Seinfeld' or re-watching old movies helps older people feel re-connected with pseudo-friends from their past. Another outlay of $181,000 went to University of Kentucky researchers who studied how cocaine use 'enhanced' the sex drive of the Japanese quail. The researchers' website explains that they chose the birds because they 'readily engage in reproductive behavior in the laboratory' and 'provide a convenient and interesting alternative to standard laboratory rats and pigeons.' The 'Origami' condom research has become doubly controversial with dueling lawsuits in which the newfangled condom's designer and his assistant are lobbing accusations of fraud and misuse of government funds for trips, cars and cosmetic surgery. The Washington Free Beacon reported in May that Origami Condom creator Daniel Resnic was accused of spending NIH grant money on an Amsterdam junket, a Cadillac and a party at the Playboy Mansion. He also is under investigation for flouting research protocols by designating his friends as test subjects and asking them to report back after they tested the product. NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), the subagency that would ordinarily fund vaccine research for Ebola, provided Resnic with the money beginning in 2006. Dr. Francis Collins, the head doc at NIH, complained bitterly on Sunday that budget 'cuts' were to blame for his agency's failure to produce a vaccine in time to fend off this year's Ebola virus epidemic. All coked up and ready to go: Japanese quails have no compunction about mating in front of lab-coated researchers, making them perfect candidates for an NIH study about the effects of cocaine on libido . 'Origami Condom' creator Daniel Resnic is accused of spending NIH grant dollars on cosmetic surgery, a Playboy Mansion party and exotic trips, and using his friends as informal research subjects instead of holding a controlled human trial . BUDGET CUTS? Overall federal funding for the NIH (in red) is up 69 per cent since 2000; the NIAID, which is in charge of epidemic disease research, is up 220 per cent . Collins blamed a '10-year slide in research support' in a Huffington Post interview. But overall NIH funding sits at $30.15 billion this year – up from $17.84 billion in 2000. NIAID has seen its budget grow by 220 per cent over the same stretch of years. It took a different NIH department to see the value in giving a University of Missouri team $548,000 to find out if 30-something partiers feel immature after they binge drink while people in their mid-20s don't. 'We interpreted our findings to suggest that, at 25, drinking is more culturally acceptable,' declared a doctoral student who coordinated the government-funded field work. A generous $610,000 paid for a 120-nation survey to determine how satisfied people in different countries are with their lives. A staggering $1.1 million funded research into how athletes perceive their in-game surroundings, including one Purdue University study that discovered golfers can putt 10 per cent better if they imagine the hole is bigger. And $832,000 went to learn if it was possible to get uncircumcised South African tribesmen into the habit of washing their genitals after having sex. 'If we find that men are able to practice consistent washing practices after sex,' researchers at Penn State University told the NIH, 'we will plan to test whether this might protect men from becoming HIV infected in a later study.' $484,000: Researchers explored whether hypnotists could help postmenopausal women avoid hot flashes . Deep breath and count to ten ... yes, you on the left: Precious NIH research dollars established that marriages are happier when wives calm down quickly after arguing with their husbands . The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group that advises federal lawmakers, reported in 2011 that NIH's funding 'has grown significantly over the past 15 years,' including a $10 billion increase solely from President Obama's 2009 economic stimulus plan. 'In 2010, over half of all nondefense discretionary spending for health research and development went to NIH,' CBO noted. The agency recommended a drastic cut in NIH's funding, citing a 2009 Government Accountability Office report that 'found gaps in NIH’s ability' to keep tabs on what happened to its outgoing grant money. 'Some costs could probably be reduced or eliminated,' the CBO concluded, 'without harming high-priority research.' One of those candidates might be a $484,000 study to determine if hypnosis can reduce hot flashes in postmenopausal women. If that doesn't work, NIH also spent $294,000 to try yoga.","The NIH budget included $2.4 million for a new condom design whose inventor is now being investigated for fraud .

"Few can fail to be awed by the spectacle of shimmering curtains of green that twist and turn on the horizon, combined with twirling cascades of red, yellow and purple.

Stunning: The Northern Lights were also visible in the North East of England. Above, the Aurora Borealis light up the sky near Hallbankgate in North Cumbria . Out of this world: And they also appeared over areas of Scotland, such as Carrbridge in Inverness-shire (pictured) But not this week. After months of . storms, floods and downpours, nature took pity on us and gave a rare . glimpse of the lights across most of the British Isles, including . southern England. In . Essex, Norfolk, South Wales, Gloucestershire and even Jersey, stargazers . were able to enjoy one of the best displays in years. The sight is . caused when electrically charged particles ejected from the Sun – known . as a coronal mass ejection – hit gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere. The nature of the Earth’s magnetic field means these particles usually rain down around the North and South Poles. But . if the outburst from the Sun is strong enough – and an eruption this . week was particularly powerful – there are so many charged particles . bombarding the atmosphere they can be seen from much lower latitudes, . including southern Britain. Dr . Lucie Green, of Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College . London, said astronomers got wind that we were in for a spectacular week . after satellites captured activity on our nearest star. Spectacular: People watch the Northern Lights, dance over St. Mary's Lighthouse in Whitely Bay just outside Newcastle . Lit up: The lighthouse appears to light up as a collision of particles from the sun enter the earth's atmosphere .

Visible: Such light displays in the sky often occur in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, but they were visible in North Tyneside . Amazing: A sightseer points at the Northern Lights at Embleton Bay in Northumberland . Colourful: The bay was lit up with purple, blue and green colours as millions of particles entered the earth's atmosphere . She . said: ‘When we were watching the Sun on Tuesday we saw that a . particularly large and fast eruption leapt off from its atmosphere, and . the models predicted that we would probably get a glancing blow from . this eruption, and they were right.’ She . added: ‘They are always seen at high latitudes – they are there all the . time. But when we get a large coronal mass ejection from the Sun, it . erodes the Earth’s magnetic field and we get the lights at lower . latitudes. In 1859, the lights were so strong they were seen almost down . at the Equator.’ The . colours of lights produced depend on the gases hit by the solar . particles. The most common in northern latitudes is a yellowish pale . green – caused as a result of collisions with oxygen atoms 60 miles . high. Rarer red aurorae . happen when particles striking oxygen 200 miles up. Nitrogen gas . produces blue or purple light. Scientists know what causes the colours – . but the reasons behind what causes patterns like shimmering curtains or . steadily glowing sheets  remain a mystery.

William Henderson, who spotted the lights from Pan Tod Beacon on . Ruardean Hill in Gloucestershire, said: 'Well tonight turned into . something truly amazing. 'What was meant to be a simple night time shoot of the stars turned into something which I can only describe as awesome.

Thompson, presenter of Stargazing Live, told the BBC: ‘What happens is . there is stuff called the solar wind, which is electronically charged . particles, and they take two or three days to get here and when they do . get here they cause the gas atoms in the sky to glow. It is as simple as . that.’ The lights could be seen in the northern regions of the country last night, such as . Whitely Bay in North Tyneside, where a lighthouse could be seen shining brightly. They were also captured by photographers above Scotland-based homes in Carrbrige in Inverness-shire, and Inverkirkaig, near Lochinver in Sutherlandshire. Mr . Thompson said the aurora over Britain had been expected, after a burst . of activity on the sun around four days ago, but that it had been . brighter than expected. ‘Aurora . displays usually happen around the North and South poles, so to see . them this far south is pretty rare,’ he told the Eastern Daily Press. ‘I haven’t seen one like that in Norfolk for about 20 years.’ The aurora was due to last for several hours before fading during the early hours of this morning. ‘Scientifically, we don’t learn a lot from aurora borealis – they are just nice to look at,’ he added. ‘But .

"As the big chill hits America, runners are heading indoors - but many are finding all the treadmills are already taken. However, a Chilean firm may have the answer. Oxford Fitness has built a giant running machine with space for ten runners at once. Scroll down for video . Over the weekend, Oxford plans to host a pair of two-hour races on the machine in Santiago, Chile, incraeasing the speed until only one runner is left. Designed by Chilean company Oxford Fitness, which sells gym equipment, it is 5 meters high, 3 meters wide and 6 meters long. Speed increases in increments of just over half a mile per hour all the way up to roughly 10 miles per hour, or a 6-minute per mile pace. Over the weekend, Oxford plans to host a pair of two-hour races on the machine in Santiago, Chile. 'Oxford Treadmill Fitness invites us to participate in a form of racing like never before,' the firm says. 'The idea is that the last competitor who falls, wins the race.' The site claims the contests won't be for the faint hearted. For the first of two races, the treadmill's speed will be set at a steady 6 miles per hour to test stamina. Designed by Chilean company Oxford Fitness, which sells gym equipment, it is 5 meters high, 3 meters wide and 6 meters long. Speed increases in increments of just over half a mile per hour all the way up to roughly 10 miles per hour, or a 6-minute per mile pace. During the second race, organizers will gradually edge up the pace so that runners who can't keep up get ejected off the back. The last runner remaining upright and on board will be declared the winner.

"The new Krispy Kreme milkshake is packed with calories . Not even the most deluded person would pop into a Krispy Kreme doughnut and coffee bar for a healthy meal. After all, the chain, which has become a fixture on the British High Street in just a few sticky years, is famed for its indulgent sugary treats. But the calorie content of its latest range might cause even Homer Simpson — the world’s most famous doughnut lover — to raise an eyebrow. It has been revealed that Krispy Kreme’s new ‘doughnut-inspired’ milkshakes contain up to 612 calories — nearly as much as a roast chicken meal or a McDonald’s cheeseburger with fries. Add a doughnut — perhaps with a caramel crunch or vanilla cappuccino topping — and your morning ‘snack’ will give you a staggering 1,000 calories. That’s half the calories that a woman needs in one day and 40 per cent of those recommended for a man. Even without the doughnut, the shake is more than a quarter of a woman’s daily recommended calorie intake. Short of injecting yourself with glucose, there can’t be many quicker ways to pile on the pounds. Krispy Kreme’s addition to the highly calorific milkshake market is just the tip of the iceberg. Everywhere you look, multinational coffee chains and takeaway outlets are plying us with belly-busting shakes, gut-bulging smoothies and waist-expanding frappuccinos. So just how bad for us are these shakes? And how on earth did the big food companies persuade so many adults to consume what used to be drinks for children? Krispy Kreme was created in 1937 and arrived in the UK from America in 2003, when it opened an outlet in Harrods. Setting up stall in Britain’s poshest shop was a statement of intent. The company is coy about its ingredients and each item’s nutritional content . The company wanted to change the image of the doughnut from a cheap and cheerful treat to something more luxurious, expensive and profitable. In the past 11 years, it has largely succeeded. Today, the company, sells 60 million doughnuts a year in the UK — 165,000 every day. The company attracts the sort of loyalty normally reserved for pop stars and iPhones. When a new store opened in Cardiff in 2011, 1,000 people queued overnight. With this kind of devoted fanbase, the arrival of yet more calorific treats was inevitable. And they sure are fattening. Krispy Kreme’s strawberries-and-cream shake — a blend of fruit juice, sugar, cream and shortbread biscuit — contains that staggering figure: 612 calories. The chocolate-and-honeycomb-topped Caramel Crunch has 508 calories, while the Chocolate Dream shake — cream, cocoa powder and chocolate flakes — has 555. The closest it comes to a ‘healthy’ shake is its ‘Coffee Kreme’, made with espresso, chai tea and cream. But that is still packed with 446 calories. The company is coy about its ingredients and each item’s nutritional content. By law it doesn’t have to display them online or on the cups, but the berry-and-cream version of the shake on sale in America, with a similar calorie count, contains 24g of saturated fat and 71g — that’s 17 teaspoons — of sugar. It’s difficult to imagine who this ‘coronary in a cup’ is aimed at. And if a packet of crisps with 180 calories is classed as ‘junk’ food, what on earth do we call these drinks? Rubbish-tip treats? Perhaps it’s unfair to pick on Krispy Kreme. Others are just as guilty. Starbucks sells a gigantic white chocolate mocha coffee with whipped cream containing 613 calories. At McDonald’s, the large caramel iced frappe — made with skimmed milk — has 460 calories, while the Caffe Nero Caramellatte has 485 calories. The companies selling these sugary, fatty beverages insist they are only offering consumers a choice. Judith Denby, chief marketing officer at Krispy Kreme UK, said: ‘Krispy Kreme offers a range of drink options. Milkshakes range in calories from 446kcals to 612kcals, making them occasional indulgent treats rather than an everyday drink.’ But what alarms experts is the way the body reacts to calories in liquid form compared to those found in solid food. Dr Sarah Schenker, spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, says: ‘You are less likely to feel as satisfied with liquid calories. And because it’s in liquid form, your blood sugar levels can go higher more quickly — then drop again. That may leave you feeling hungry soon afterwards.’ Scroll down for video . Add a doughnut to the milkshake — perhaps with a caramel crunch or vanilla cappuccino topping — and your morning ‘snack’ will give you a staggering 1,000 calories . What also concerns dietitians is the way some of these drinks are marketed as treats to be consumed between meals. Not many customers go into a Krispy Kreme store for a square meal at lunch. ‘If you had a roast chicken meal or burger with fries, you would hopefully stop what you are doing, sit down and concentrate on eating it,’ Dr Schenker says. ‘But these drinks are almost mindless eating and snacking. Two hours after you have one you may be ready for a roast dinner.’ The arrival of the mega-calorie milkshake doesn’t just reflect the desire of big businesses to flog us sugar and fat in ever more creative ways. With more calories than a burger and chips, the new Krispy Kreme milkshake takes junk food to a new level . It also highlights the creeping infantilism of our diet. This fashion for childish food is everywhere. You see it in the rise of the sugary ‘doughnut-flavoured’ milkshake and the popularity of doughnuts themselves. You see it in our enthusiasm for iced frappuccinos and hot chocolate with whipped cream in coffee bars. You see it in the extraordinary popularity of Haribo sweets among adults. One of Marks & Spencer’s biggest successes in recent years had been the Percy Pig sweet. ‘Percy’ now appears on dozens of products bought by adults. Britain has yet to reach the obesity levels of America. But with this fashion for children’s drinks and food among adults, it won’t be long before we are turned into a nation of blubbery Homer Simpsons.","Krispy Kreme’s new ‘doughnut-inspired’ milkshakes contain up to 612 calories .

"Pet owners looking to launch the next online sensation or just longing for a new view of their dog's dashing and digging won't have to shop for long to find the perfect holiday gift. Wrap up a dog harness that holds any durable, wearable camera and watch Frisbee fetch, lazy lap naps and every memory in between come alive. GoPro Inc.'s Fetch dog harness fits over Fido's chest or back and holds the small, waterproof camera known for attaching to helmets, surfboards, cars and wrists to film rugged adventures. Sony, Garmin and Kurgo also make camera mounts for dogs. The device is among a legion of gifts that retailers have rounded up for pet wish lists this year. Narrowing it down is tough, but the harness tops the more unique options and creates footage that lasts. Doggone awesome: A dog wearing two GoPro cameras, one on his back and one on his chest is  held on by what is known as a Fetch dog harness . Bark up someone's else's tree: Thor, a French bulldog, wears what is marketed as an 'ugly' sweater, created by Bret Michaels for his Pets Rock Line . The most pet-friendly camera in the GoPro Inc. line is the Hero4, which allows people to decide what the dog records and control all the functions with a touch screen, company spokeswoman Kelly Baker said. The camera sells for $399, and the mount costs $59. The chest harness captures bone-chewing and digging, while the back mount films running and jumping, Baker said. They adjust to fit dogs weighing 15 to 120 pounds. The canine camera view has proved popular. A video went viral of an eager Labrador strapped with a camera sprinting through trees and across rocks to an Italian beach, where it leaps into the ocean. John Duffield of Santa Monica, California, loves the footage he got from the GoPro he mounted on his two dogs. He got enough shots to make a short video shortly before his chow-Labrador-Akita mix, Lupa, died. But Duffield didn't strap the camera to his Chihuahua, Pup, three months ago when he and his wife brought their newborn daughter home from the hospital. 'Pup is like a member of the family, too,' Duffield said. 'He belonged in this picture because he was welcoming home part of his family.' Those looking for pet gifts besides the traditional treats, new bowls and beds can give something unexpected such as: . UGLY SWEATERS . They are the rage this year, so PetSmart Inc. will hawk ugly sweaters for cats and dogs from Bret Michaels' Pets Rock line ($15.99), said Shelly Albrecht, spokeswoman for the national retailer.

"He is the man behind one the most iconic album covers in the world. And now Sir Peter Blake, the pop art expert, has decided to recreate his Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover for the Beatles in a new work urging people to support their local shopkeepers. The 82-year-old has created a collage called High Street Heroes in the style of the album cover featuring 40 small businesses - including fishmongers, cheese makers and a baker - from across the UK. Sir Peter, who worked at a local butcher when he was 13, said it is important to support small independent businesses that give character to a local area and are only able to thrive through hard work. High Street Heroes has been created by pop artist Sir Peter Blake and resembles the Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover he developed for the Beatles, which is now one of the most famous designs . The cover for the Beatles album has become one of the most iconic and won a Grammy award for its design . He said: 'I try and use small shops as much as I can. I live in a place where there is a wet fish shop and a couple of delicatessens. 'I buy my art materials from a local small shop. 'Small shops and the Great British shopkeeper have been at the forefront of British culture for hundreds of years now. 'The notion of a 'nation of shopkeepers' is embedded in our folklore and the wonderful variety of today's independent shops as well as the character that small businesses bring to a local area make them an ideal subject matter for modern pop art. 'Having worked at a local butcher at the age of 13, I have also experienced the dedication and hard work that goes into running a small shop. 'I still buy all my art materials from an independently-run art shop. It is for all these reasons that I am thrilled to be lending my support to a campaign that champions small businesses.' The artist has joined supermodel Daisy Lowe, 25, in urging people to support their local shops, traders and restaurants on December 6 as part of the Small Business Saturday campaign. His artwork is modelled on his Sgt Pepper album cover which became one of the most recognised in the world and won a Grammy award for its design in 1967. Sir Peter Blake said supporting independent shopkeepers is important and makes communities unique . Sir Peter unveiled his artwork in advance of the Small Business Saturday event taking place on December 6 . It features the Beatles surrounded by celebrities including Edgar Allan Poe, Fred Astaire and Bob Dylan. An adaptation of his work, featuring the faces of music executives in place of the Beatles was valued at £70,000. It was created in December 1967 to celebrate the success of the album. Sir Peter, of Chiswick, west London, said of his design: 'It is a form I use quite often, the idea of a crowd. 'What I wanted in this case was very formal photos of people just standing absolutely still looking at the camera and holding something which indicates what their trade or shop is.' Husband and wife Merlin Jones, 28, and Genevieve Schiffenhaus, 29, who run independent deli 'General Store' in Peckham Rye, south London feature in the top right corner of the collage. They quit their careers in 2011 and toured the country learning how to make cheeses and bake bread before opening their shop last year. The adapted artwork for the Beatles album cover saw it become the most valuable in the world . The shop's wares include locally sourced bread from Brixton, Peckham-grown redcurrants, handmade jams from Hackney and coffee roasted in Clerkenwell. Mrs Jones said: 'Merlin and I both knew that food was where our interest lay, so we decided to take the leap three years ago. 'We left London and visited firms in Somerset, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, Wales and Scotland to learn how to make cheese and bake bread. 'That now informs our running of the shop as we know about the production processes and all the skill and hard work that goes into them. 'Since we are a small shop, we have personally selected every item in here and would recommend and stand by every one of them. Babette Kulik, 47, who sources rare first edition books and stages candlelit evening readings and poetry events at her bookshop The Society Club in London's Soho features on the collage. Also appearing are Cardiff fishmonger Nick Bryant, 36, who takes delivery of the catch of local fishermen at 3am, and Bath boutique owners Olivia Brewer and Nik Blake, both 32. Small Business Saturday is organised by American Express which found the event boosted the turnover of small businesses by £468 million last year. It was originally run in America and Chuka Umunna, the business secretary, asked the company to bring the event to British shores. Model Daisy Lowe is one of the celebrity supporters of the campaign. She said:  'I'm passionate about small, independent shops and have picked up some of my most treasured outfits from one-of-a-kind boutiques. 'One of my favourite discoveries in small business is an amazing shop in Somerset near where my mum lives. I always find amazing 1930s dresses.'","Sir Peter Blake designed the Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover for the Beatles, which is one of the most iconic album covers .

"A glamorous TV presenter with close family ties to Vladimir Putin claims well-to-do young Russians are desperately fleeing the country due to his authoritarian policies. Ksenia Sobchak, who has known the Russian president since she was a child, said growing numbers of people are leaving Moscow, seeking citizenship, residency or visas for western countries. Ms Sobchak's father, Anatoly Sobchak, was a political mentor to Putin and introduced the ex-KGB officer into the world of politics. Ksenia Sobchak, daughter of Vladimir Putin's mentor Anatoly Sochak said many of her friends were actively trying to flee Moscow because of the Russian President's hardline regime and the economic slump . Vladimir Putin, attending the funeral of Anatoly Sobchak with Mrs Sobchack and her daughter Ksenia . Putin, holding flowers, was very close to Ms Sobchak's father Anatoly, whom he regarded as a mentor . Sanctions imposed by the West over the Kremlin leader's annexation of Crimea and military threats to Ukraine have led to major economic turmoil with the rouble plunging to its lowest-ever level, slashing the savings of many people. Ms Sobchak said: 'This is the main society talk in good restaurants in Moscow. It is either getting citizenship, or residence permits, or the like.' She said she would join new anti-Putin protests even though she is 'scared' of being sent to prison. 'My friends, all they are talking about is visas.' She said: 'They keep sending me these messages, like ""Ksenia, there is Bulgarian citizenship"", ""nine other options open until the end of November"" or ""I got mine in the Czech republic"", or ""I got mine somewhere else"".' Anatoly Sobchak, centre, was the Mayor of St Petersburg and taught Vladimir Putin law after he left the KGB . Putin, left, was one of the most prominent mourners at Anatoly Sobchak's funeral in February 2000 . Ms Sobchak is the daughter of Putin's mentor Anatoly Sobchak, former mayor of St Petersburg, who gave the strongman his first political post after he quit as a KGB spy when the Soviet Union collapsed. Earlier he taught law to Putin at Leningrad State University. A grieving Putin stood alongside Ms Sobchak and her mother Lyudmila at his funeral in 2000. Ms Sobchak, pictured, said she was willing to join anti-Putin protests but was afraid of going to prison . Putin was so close to the family that earlier it was widely thought he was godfather to Ms Sobchak, though this is denied. Ironically, in 1997, Putin helped Anatoly Sobchak flee Russia to Paris when he faced a criminal investigation. The 33-year-old celebrity said in an interview with Echo Moscow radio that she had 'nowhere to run' and would stay in Russia, unlike many of her friends. Her comments came as new statistics show an alarming surge of Russians leaving their country with the highest ever figure of 203,000 in first eight months of the year. Many believe it is an underestimate. Many of those deserting Russia are the wealthy seeking to preserve their fortunes from the boom years, but also include 'qualified specialists' in management, technology and science, who are vital for the economy. Capital flight - sending money abroad - is expected to hit a staggering £60 billion this year further crippling the Russian economy. In a blistering critique of her father's protege, she criticised the increasing personality cult around Putin, arguing it was driving Russia to ruin. 'Our passion for relying on big personalities is what - sadly - is killing us,' she said. Ms Sobchak - who also owns a magazine and a restaurant - said she is ready to join new street protests against Putin, even though state TV channels boycotted her after she took part in earlier demonstrations. She also faced a probe of her finances. 'I can lose my magazine, my restaurant, I'm prepared to take these risks,' she said. 'I won't be going to set cars on fire with you, and I am not ready to go to jail for my beliefs. 'I am ready to lose my job, money, my social status, but there is a bit of an internal borderline. Mine is that I am not ready to go to jail.' She admitted this could be seen as 'my weakness, cowardice'. Anatoly Sobchak greets Prime Minister John Major right, while Vladimir Putin looks on in the background, third right, in 10 Downing Street on September 20, 1991, less than two years after he had left the KGB . She warned: 'In every normal Western country, any person who is not prepared to go to jail can be politically active and even think about a political career. 'In our country everything is too tough. In other words if you are ready to be jailed, to be like Mandela, then you can claim a right to become the next president. 'And if you are not ready, then don't even try. 'This is why I am not doing it, and I honestly say I am not ready to experience a Russian jail even for my beliefs that are important for me. I am scared.' She alleged Putin has 'so much money' that he is no longer interested in 'building another house in Crimea or getting another yacht'. She did not say where the alleged money came from. Last year his official salary was around £65,000, a drop in the ocean compared with oligarchs who have made fortunes in his presidency. The Kremlin has denied claims that Putin is once of the world's richest men. He thinks of himself as a 'big patriot' and he seized Crimea because he believed the West 'let him down' by meddling in his sphere of influence in the former USSR, added Ms Sobchak.","Ksenia Sobchak fears that Putin's hardline policies are bad for Russia .

"Hurricane Sandy is the second most powerful hurricane in modern history, with its might exceeding even that of Katrina, according to a measurement of the hurricane's strength in relation to its size. Researchers have found that Sandy's Integrated Kinetic Energy index, or IKE, which quantifies the power of a hurricane based on how far out tropical-storm force winds extend from the center, ranked second only to Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Hurricane Sandy's IKE was 140 Terajoules, which was about 20 Terajoules higher than Katrina's, according to Brian McNoldy, a senior researcher at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marin and Atmospheric Science.

'Sandy's IKE was over 140 Terajoules (TJ, 1 TJ = 1 trillion Joules = 277,778 kilowatt hours), meaning it generated more than twice the energy of the Hiroshima atomic bomb,' McNoldy wrote on a blog published by the Washington Post. 'At any given moment, many hurricanes contain more energy than an atomic bomb in their surface winds alone (even excluding winds at higher elevations and latent heat energy),' he added. The category levels that are more widely cited to quantify the power of hurricanes purely measure wind speed.   Katrina was measured as a Category 3 hurricane at landfall and later rose to a Category 5. The estimated cost of Hurricane Sandy is $20 billion .

"Channel 4 is to broadcast the Muslim call to prayer during Ramadan this year, it revealed yesterday. It is believed to be the first time a mainstream British television channel has broadcast the Islamic call to prayer. Starting next week, the broadcaster will transmit the morning call to prayer daily for the 30 days of Ramadan. Morning call: Channel 4 will broadcast the first call to prayer for the 30 days of Ramadan. There are five calls to prayer each day . Channel 4’s head of factual programming Ralph Lee said the channel would act as a ‘nationwide tannoy system’ for Britain’s 2.8million Muslims while they observed Ramadan. He said almost five per cent of the British population would ‘actively engage’ in Ramadan this month, adding: ‘Can we say the same of other national events that have received blanket coverage on television such as the Queen’s coronation anniversary?’ Critics questioned whether the decision to transmit the call to prayer was a ‘publicity-seeking stunt’ by the controversial broadcaster. Mr Lee said Ramadan usually received minimal coverage on Britain’s main television channels and said he believed Channel 4’s series of programmes during July and August was chance for Britain’s moderate Muslims to be heard. Earlier this year the channel was criticised for giving militant Anjem Choudary, the former head of banned Islamist organisation Al Muhajiroun, a platform to air his views. Choudary and radical Islamist Abu Nusaybah were given a slot of the broadcaster’s 4thought.TV, a two-minute opinion show which airs immediately after Channel 4 News’ nightly bulletin. Mr Lee told the Radio Times that most television coverage of Islam was linked to terrorism or extremism. He said: ‘Even when moderate Muslims do appear, it’s often only to provide a counterpoint to these issues. 'Nationwide tannoy system': Channel 4 says it wants to cater to the 2.8million Muslims who observe Ramadan.There are restrictions on religious programming, including a ban on seeking recruits . ‘Following the horrific events in Woolwich and subsequent reprisals against British Muslims, there has surely never been a more pressing need to give a voice to the moderate mainstream majority.’ The call to prayer is usually delivered from a mosque and is sometimes relayed by loudspeaker. There are five calls to prayer a day but Channel 4 said it would only broadcast the first morning call to prayer each day. All the daily prayers will be played on the channel’s website. It will be delivered by musician Hassen Rasool and accompanied by a three-minute video showing him outside various London landmarks, including St Paul’s Cathedral. The first broadcast will be next Tuesday (July 9), the first day of Ramadan, at 3am. Muslims around the world fast between sunrise and sunset during Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Channel 4 will also include the sunrise and sunset times during its weather reports. The broadcaster said it had consulted Muslim clerics about its series of Ramadan programmes. Mr Lee said: ‘The calls to prayer prompt Muslims to carry out quiet moments of worship, but hopefully they’ll also make other viewers sit up and notice that this event is taking place. Controversial: Channel 4 came under fire after giving airtime to militant Anjem Choudary . ‘No doubt Channel 4 will be criticised for focusing attention on a “minority” religion but that’s what we’re here to do - provide space for the alternative and a voice to the under-represented.’ His comments attracted some criticism among far-Right groups and commentators. A group called Britain First, which describes itself as a ‘patriotic political movement’, said on Twitter: ‘Get ready for a month’s worth of TV programmes pandering to Islam courtesy of Channel 4.’ The group’s followers expressed outrage about the decision, including calls for a boycott of Channel 4. There are restrictions on religious programming on British television, including a ban on seeking recruits. Religious organisations are banned from running national terrestrial stations, although there are some religious radio stations and satellite or digital channels. There is also a legal requirement for the BBC and ITV to broadcast a certain amount of religious programming. The new Archbishop of Canterbury warned earlier this year that dropping religion from television schedules would have ‘dangerous’ consequences and would ‘cultivate ignorance’. The Most Reverend Justin Welby praised ITV’s Strictly Kosher and Channel 4’s show Islam: The Untold Story as examples of good religious programming. Terry Sanderson, president of the National Secular Society, questioned whether Channel 4’s decision to broadcast the call to prayer was a ‘publicity-seeking stunt’. He said: ‘It seems reasonable that there should be some acknowledgment on TV of the needs of the growing Muslim population in Britain, although one can’t help wondering whether this is just another of Channel 4’s publicity-seeking stunts. ‘Given that the BBC devotes hundreds of hours a year to Christianity, with two or three church services every day on its radio stations, and hardly any mention of minority religions, a few minutes devoted to Islam doesn’t seem unreasonable.’","Call to prayer usually delivered from a mosque and relayed by loudspeaker .

"As a former England footballer, he might not be the first person you would expect to deliver  an impassioned critique of the literary canon. But John Barnes has blamed authors such as Agatha Christie, Rudyard Kipling and Edgar Rice Burroughs for making Britain a country of ‘passive racists’. The ex-Liverpool winger insisted classic tales such as Ten Little Indians, Tarzan of the Apes and The Jungle Book have instilled bigotry in the minds of generations of British children. Bigotry: England footballer, John Barnes told students at Liverpool University that 'passive racism' was in everyone because of hundreds of years of subtle bigotry in British culture . Barnes launched his fierce attack on literature in a lecture to students at Liverpool University about the causes of racism in football. The father of seven told the audience that ‘passive racism is inherent in all of us’ because of ‘preconceived ideas’ planted through books and films. He said: ‘Over the last 200 years we have had negative images of black people ... in literature by Rudyard Kipling to Agatha Christie. Tarzan showed that. Abused: John Barnes, pictured kicking away a banana thrown at him from the stands, was subjected to racist abuse throughout his career . Racism: Authors Agatha Christie, left, and Rudyard Kipling, right, have been accused of perpetuating bigoted views of black people which has contributed to created a nation of racists, according to John Barnes . ‘Racism came from the idea of race, which is a man-made construct. Race is not scientific or genetic. It does not actually exist. Race came about to validate and justify colonialism and slavery.’ He added: ‘There are examples everywhere. Rudyard Kipling, one of our greatest heroes, wrote The White Man’s Burden, in which he wrote it was incumbent on the Americans to go and civilise the savages in the Philippines. ‘Colonialism in Africa – Agatha Christie wrote a book called Ten Little N*****s. Would we accuse Agatha Christie of being racist? No, but that is passive racism.’ Controversial classics: Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, left, Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes, and Agatha Chrisite's Ten Little Indians are inherently racist, according to John Barnes . Barnes moved to England aged 13 in the late 1970s when his father was Jamaica’s military attaché to London. He is among England’s most-capped black players, but at Liverpool FC he was regularly subjected to racist abuse from spectators and infamously had a banana hurled at him during a Merseyside derby with Everton at Goodison Park. The Commission for Racial Equality has called for the comic hero's adventure Tintin in the Congo to be banned . Twice married, Barnes has called for the National Curriculum to be revised so all children are taught that race is only a concept. He said: ‘If we get rid of passive racism then overcoming overt racism will take care of itself.’ Ross Dawson, a senior lecture in English at Liverpool John Moores University, denied Barnes had branded the authors as racists. He said: ‘He identified the contemporary idea of race and racism as originating in the history of transatlantic slavery and colonialism. These were three writers which he used as examples of popular national literature which reproduced these racial assumptions. ‘His reference to passive racism was an attempt to show how we all have assumptions about race... without really understanding where those assumptions come from.’ Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: ‘The curriculum could do with being more explicit on this issue. A key role of education is to foster respect and understanding.’ Last year, one of Tintin’s classic adventures was banished to the adult shelves of bookshops because it was deemed overtly racist. Tintin In The Congo was given warning labels by many retailers over fears it could negatively affect children. Rudyard Kipling’s reputation has come under attack over recent years with some critics branding him a ‘racist’ and a propagandist for the elite. One of Kipling's most controversial poems The White Man's Burden, published in 1899, is often cited as revealing Kipling’s contempt for the colonised people, it begins: . Take up the White Man's burden,Send forth the best ye breed,Go, bind your sons to exile,To serve your captives' need;To wait, in heavy harness,On fluttered folk and wild,Your new-caught sullen peoples,Half devil and half child. The poem was originally written for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, but exchanged for ‘Recessional’; Kipling changed the text of ‘Burden’ to reflect the subject of American colonization of the Philippines, recently won from Spain in the Spanish-American War. Some scholars of the Nobel Prize winner, who was born of English parents in Bombay in 1865, at the height of the Raj, have advanced the view that Kipling used the poem to imply that white people have an obligation to subjugate other 'lesser' people. Other students of the poem have said it alludes to the philanthropic view, common in Kipling's formative years, that the rich have a moral duty and obligation to help ‘the poor’ ‘better’ themselves whether the poor want the help or not.","Former international footballer blames some of country's favourite writers for perpetuating 'negative images of black people'

"All in the taste: The world appears to have developed an almost ­insatiable appetite for Nutella . Devotees will tell you that it is delicious smeared over toast, sensational oozing out of pancakes, and the secret ingredient in one of the most delicious chocolate cakes known to man. Half a century after it was invented in the back room of an Italian bakery, the world appears to have an almost ­insatiable appetite for Nutella, the hazelnut chocolate spread. Last year addicts devoured a ­staggering 365,000 tonnes of the stuff in 160 countries. Nutella’s Facebook page has more than 26 million fans. In Britain sales have overtaken ­Marmite. With more than 11 million jars bought each year, it is now the most popular branded spread in the UK. If you’ve never been that impressed with the sickly sweetness or high calorie count, the appeal of Nutella can be hard to fathom. But for fans, the distinctive glass jar and plastic white lid instil the kind of brand loyalty that Pepsi, McDonald’s and M&S can only dream about. So why does this sugary brown gloop, which this month celebrates its 50th birthday, inspire such devotion? And how did such an unhealthy product become such a massive brand? Nutella may have been launched in 1964, but it only began to make serious inroads into the British breakfast in the Eighties. Before then chocolate spreads were runny, rather than thick and creamy, and flavoured overwhelmingly with cocoa. For those like me, raised in the ­Seventies, chocolate spread — ­particularly Cadbury’s Chocolate Spread — was a very occasional treat, saved for holidays or birthdays. But then came Nutella. Many of us assumed that, like most such sugar-laden indulgences, it hailed from ­America. In fact, the U.S., like Britain, was late to the party. Success: It wasn't until Michele Ferrero (pictured) took over the running of the company that Nutella took off internationally. His estimated wealth of $26billion makes him the 20th richest person in the world . For the Nutella story had started ­decades before, in the lean months after the end of the World War II when a young pastry maker from Piedmont, in the north of Italy, was looking for a way to compensate for a shortage of cocoa. Pietro Ferrero - heir to the Nutella empire - died after suffering an apparent heart attack in 2011 . His name was Pietro Ferrero and he began to experiment. The region specialised in ­growing hazelnuts and Ferrero realised he could bulk out the cocoa with nut paste. His first contribution came in 1946 with a hard cocoa and hazelnut brick that had to be sliced with a knife. He named it Giandujot after a famous ­carnival figure of the time. A few years later, he found a way to add vegetable oil to the mix, creating a spreadable v­ersion called SuperCrema — the forerunner of Nutella. Making the nut and chocolate combination soft was key. Now a little chocolate spread could go a long way. And crucially it could be spread on bread, a vital staple of the Italian diet. You might not have been able to afford chocolates in postwar Italy, but you could afford a taste of SuperCrema. In 1964 SuperCrema turned into Nutella, thanks to Pietro’s son, Michele, who improved the recipe and developed the ­distinctive glass jar. The new name was an attempt to appeal to an international audience — nuts for an Anglo-America coolness, and ‘ella’ to give it a soft, Italian ending. By 1966 it was on sale in France and Germany — and by 1977 production began in Australia. Today, around a quarter of all hazelnuts grown in the world end up in the spread. ‘They made such a blend, ­people became crazy about it almost immediately,’ says ­Ferrero President Francesco Paolo Fulci. ‘It is something absolutely ­fantastic because every time we enter a new market there is an immediate wave of interest for this product. We almost don’t need to do anything.’ A jar is sold every 2.5 seconds globally. The company produces enough Nutella each year to create a smear of spread that would circle the world 1.4 times. Stacked up, the jars would build 22,000 Big Bens. In the UK alone sales are worth nearly £30 million a year — and rose last year by more than 22 per cent. Part of its success is down to the way that the middle classes have embraced the product despite it being so obviously unhealthy. A German advert for Nutella hazelnut spread from circa 1970. Last year addicts devoured a ­staggering 365,000 tonnes of the stuff in 160 countries. Nutella's Facebook page has more than 26 million fans . Nigella Lawson, the epitome of middle-class cooking, uses it in recipes for cheesecake and chocolate cake, a treat she describes as ‘one of the most delicious cakes’ she makes. Meanwhile clever marketing means it was promoted from the very start as an everyday luxury, an affordable guilty pleasure. Ferrero also talked up Nutella’s naturalness and has suggested it can be part of a balanced breakfast, sometimes to the irritation of consumer groups. It’s certainly true that it is mostly natural. A 750g jar ­contains 97 hazelnuts, along with sugar, vegetable oil, cocoa and skimmed milk powder. It also has whey powder and soya lecithin to keep it glossy and creamy, along with a drop of vanilla flavouring. But healthy it isn’t. Nutella was created in 1946 by Pietro Ferrero in the back room of his bakery in the small town of Alba in Piedmont, Italy. With the help of his brother Giovanni, Pietro initially sold the product locally in solid loaves that had to be sliced like bread. Famed for the quality of the local chocolate and hazelnuts, residents in Alba quickly developed a taste for the product. But it wasn't until Pietro's eldest son Michele took over the running of Ferrero SpA that the Nutella product took off internationally. Relaunching his father's 'secret recipe' in 1964 in its easy-to-spread form, Nutella quickly changed the Italian thinking that chocolate was only to be eaten at Christmas and Easter. Michele's new recipe was fiercely guarded, with the company never holding a press conference or allowing media to visit a factory. However Nutella marketing push has been far more out in the open - its sponsorship of the Italian national football team in the late 1990s helping to cement the link between Nutella and Italian national pride. Now, 50 years after it first created Nutella, Ferrero SpA produces a number of different products, including Ferrero Rocher and Kinder. One in four hazelnuts produced worldwide now end up in a Ferrero product. In 2008 Michele Ferrero surpassed Silvio Berlusconi as Italy's richest man, and his estimated wealth of $26billion also makes him the 20th richest person in the world. Tragedy struck, however, when Michele's son Pietro - who had taken over as Ferrero SpA's CEO - died after suffering an apparent heart attack in South Africa 2011. The current heir of the dynasty is Giovanni Ferrero - Michele's second son - the company's acting CEO. More than half of Nutella (56.7 per cent) is pure sugar, while 30 per cent is fat. Some of that is the fat found in hazelnuts, but around 20 per cent of the spread is semi-solid palm oil. Just 13 per cent is hazelnuts. Its makeup — in terms of cocoa, sugar and fat — is almost identical to chocolate. Despite the hazelnuts, there aren’t many healthy nutrients. ­Claiming it’s good for you is like arguing that you get some of your five a day by eating ­Cadbury’s Fruit & Nut. In comparison with other breakfast spreads it does badly, too. Peanut butter has more protein, less unhealthy fat and more vitamins. And while jam and honey are 60 to 70 per cent pure sugar, they don’t have the fat. Eating Nutella is comparable to having a layer of golden syrup topped with peanut butter. And there are 100 calories in one tablespoon. You’d need to walk briskly for half an hour to burn that one spoonful off. Nutella got into trouble with the Advertising Standards Agency a few years ago after claiming ‘we want all our kids to have a balanced breakfast’ and implying that each 400g jar ­contained 52 hazelnuts, skimmed milk, cocoa powder — and nothing else. The ASA ruled that the advert exaggerated the health benefits. But those criticisms have been shrugged off by fans and by the parent company Ferrero SpA, the world’s fourth largest chocolate maker which also sells Kinder, Tic Tacs and those Ferrero Rocher truffles supposedly so beloved of ambassadors. For them Nutella is big ­business — sales make up a fifth of Ferrero’s annual £6.5 billion turnover. Today the company employs 30,000 people and has 20 ­factories around the world. Its reclusive 89-year-old owner, Michele Ferrero, is worth £15 billion — making him the richest person in Italy and, according to Forbes, the 21st richest man in the world. The Nutella bandwagon shows no signs of slowing. Ferrero has opened Nutella Cafes in ­Chicago and New York selling pastries and treats featuring the spread. Such is the ­popularity and pride in its home country that the Italian postal service issued a Nutella stamp earlier this month to mark the 50th anniversary. The company also celebrated the day with street parties throughout Europe and a pop concert in Naples. It may be sickly sweet, unhealthy and terrible for your teeth and waistline. But the popularity of Nutella just keeps on (ahem) spreading.","Nutella has 26 million fans on Facebook and sells 11million jars annually .

"Locked up: Riduan Masmud has been sentenced to jail for raping a 12-year-old girl he later married . A man who raped a 12-year-old girl, then married her three months later in an attempt to avoid being taken to court has been jailed for 12 years. Riduan Masmud, 41, will also be lashed twice after he was found guilty of assaulting his victim in a car parked by a roadside in Inanam, Borneo. The pair met through Facebook where Riduan had posed as a 24-year-old man to win her trust. She met him with a friend who witnessed the assault on February 18 last year. A member of the girl's family reported the attack to police and Riduan, a former restaurant manager, was charged. But when he appeared at Sabah Sessions Court in May last year, the father-of-four told the judge he had taken the girl as a second wife under shariah law. The court ruled that the fact he had married his victim could not be used as mitigation. Judge Ummu Kalthom Abdul Samad also noted that she had been deprived of her teenage life after stopping school and becoming a housewife, according to The Star. Sentencing, she ordered him to be jailed for 12 years, be lashed with a rotan – a type of cane – and fined. He will also be placed under police supervision for a year after serving the sentence. Riduan has also been charged with three counts of bribery for paying the girl's father 5,000 ringgit (£900) to give his consent to the marriage. Beauty spot: The island of Borneo attracts tourists from across the world, many of whom visit to see the orangutans . Speaking after the hearing, the girl’s aunt said she wanted her life to get back to school and eventually become a doctor. ‘We just want her to get on with her life and achieve her dreams,’ she told The Star. Riduan is appealing the sentence. His lawyer Ram Singh argued that there was no element of force or violence involved and that his client had married the girl, said the Sun Daily. Child marriage is not uncommon in Malaysia. The legal marriageable age in the country is 18, but Muslim girls under the age of 16 can marry with permission from religious authorities. Approximately 60 per cent of Malaysia’s 29 million residents are Muslim. Activists are calling for an end to child marriages in the country. Ivy Josiah, executive director of Women's Aid Organisation, said Malaysia should make 18 the legal minimum marrying age for all, removing the loophole for Muslim child brides. ‘It's not the end of the story. We keep hearing of isolated cases (of child marriages) but enough to raise concern,’ she said. Muslims are allowed to have up to four wives in Malaysia. Riduan's children from his first wife are aged three to 18.","Riduan Masmud, 41, sentenced to lashing, fine and jail for raping girl, 12 .

"There was an undeniable connection between two-year-old Zackary Walton and his idol Jono Lancaster when they first met on Monday. Zackary, who has Treacher Collins syndrome, had the opportunity of a lifetime to spend three days with his hero - a one of the world's most recognised individual who suffers from the same genetic disorder. Mother Sarah Walton, who contacted Mr Lancaster and asked him to spend time with her son during his nation-wide tour to educate schools about Treacher Collins syndrome, says the 30-year-old of West Yorkshire has left a huge impact on her family. The rare genetic disorder - which affects one child in every 50,000 - prevents the skull, cheek and jawbones from developing properly. Scroll down for video .

Zac carried by his mother Sarah Walton and pictured with Mr Lancaster and girlfriend Laura Richards . The 30-year-old who also suffers from Treacher Collins Syndrome is touring Australia to educate schools about the genetic disorder . 'Jono is a very important person to our family,' Mrs Walton told Daily Mail Australia. 'Not only is a huge celebrity and a hero to us but to have the same condition as our son and to have such a positive attitude is very inspiring. Treacher Collins syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of the head. It prevents the skull, cheek and jawbones from developing properly, causing facial defects and hearing loss. About one child in every 50,000 is affected. Problems range in severity from mild to very severe. In most cases, the child's intelligence is normal. 'His visit and how completely fine is after everything he has been through has given us hope for Zackary. 'He is an important role model to anyone anywhere upset about how they look and his speeches have helped change people's attitudes to love themselves for who they are.' Mr Lancaster arrived on Monday to meet the Walton family and stayed in Mannum, in South Australia, about an hour and a half from Adelaide. 'One of my biggest fears as a mother is that Zackary won't be accepted at school,' Mrs Walton said. 'But knowing that Jono is doing a tour to educate schools about Treacher Collins syndrome, it makes me feel relieved. 'It gives me hope that my son can grow up to be a happy man.' Two-year-old Zackary Walton has a tracheostomy, which means his airway is compromised and could be obstructed at any moment . Zackary is feed with a tube and his mother Sarah has to monitor him 24 hours a day . Mrs Walton says she witnessed the strong bond between the her son and Mr Lancaster on Monday afternoon. 'Zac is quite shy and doesn't warm up to anyone easily but for some reason, I don't know what it was, he connected with Jono,' she said. 'Maybe it's because Jono is such a friendly and caring person who isn't judgemental.' Just recently, Mrs Walton pleaded with the South Australian Government after they announced they were going to take away the highly-trained nurse who helps look after her son Zackary one day a week. The mother of five whose two-year-old son could die at any moment without round the clock care has told how she 'cried with happiness' after her campaign to stop her son's help being cut was successful.

Zac is held by his father Jason who's next to his wife. Mr Lancaster is pictured next to his girlfriend Laura Richards . 'We have to monitor him around the clock. It's already highly stressful and exhausting, and the one day of respite care allowed us to get by,' Mrs Walton wrote on a change.org petition that has been signed by over 37,000 people. The 27-year-old found out in October that the National Disability Insurance Scheme will reinstate Zackary's nurse after public outcry about the decision to cut his help. The family live in Mannum and living rurally means their local hospital isn't trained to deal with emergencies for people with a tracheostomy. Mrs Walton, who also looks after her four other children at home while her husband works long hours to make ends meet, said the response has been 'overwhelming'. 'I cried I was so happy. It just means so much. It means I will be able to manage, to look forward to things and plan things again,' Mrs Walton told Daily Mail Australia. 'I can do all the things everyone takes for granted again - one day a week - now without worrying about equipment or life or death. 'I can get in the car and just breathe.' On Mrs Walton's moving change.org petition she wrote: 'It's a scary weight to carry around, knowing that it's up to me to know what to do and keep my son alive' Mother Sarah Walton pleaded with the South Australian Government after they announced they were going to take away the carer who helps look after her son Zachary one day a week . Mrs Walton is looking forward to being able to continue to take her other children - Patience, Imali, Briella and Kynan - to the movies and the beach one day a week in the school holidays. 'Zackary can't go anywhere like that so the other kids miss out,' she said. 'And I can get my hair done and go food shopping, pay the bills, get in and out of the car, have coffee and have time to organise birthday presents - just the little things.' The mother described how Zackary 'absolutely adores' the nurse who looks after him one day a week and is 'very particular with people'. Over the next few years things are only going to get harder for the Walton family as Zackary begins major re-constructive surgery. The relief Mrs Walton feels knowing that a nurse will be there to help - at least for the foreseeable future - is palpable. Having a nurse for Zackary means Mrs Walton can take her four other children, Patience, Imali, Briella and Kynan, to the cinema and the beach in the school holidays . Zackary 'absolutely adores' the nurse who looks after him one day a week, Mrs Walton said . 'If anything it will get worse, not him but the issues he faces. For example he doesn't get head colds, it goes straight through his lungs… he will be starting kinder soon and the more he goes out the more he gets sick,' she said describing the challenges ahead. 'He will also have some big surgery. From next year he will have a jaw… they will break it at the back and slowly turn it millimetres per day to bring it forward. He will also have his checks rebuilt and the surgery will go into adulthood. 'There is no guarantee that he'll ever not need a feeding tube.' On Mrs Walton's moving change.org petition she wrote: 'It's a scary weight to carry around, knowing that it's up to me to know what to do and keep my son alive. It's a weight parents of children with tracheostomies shouldn't have to bear just because they live in a rural area. 'That's not right. We can't easily just move. We own our home, we'd need to uproot our other children, we have family here, we have hopes and dreams and aspirations for our future in this town. We just want to safely be able to include our son in that future.' The family are still calling for more training about tracheostomy patients for doctors and nurses in rural hospitals. 'This is my son's life at stake. It's also the lives of many other children with tracheostomy who are being ignored and neglected. Right now it seems like only a matter of time before the unthinkable happens, and someone like my son dies because of the lack of training and help the government is giving to rural tracheostomy patients,' she wrote.

"Tariq Ahmad, 35, who worked at Nur-Ul-Islam Academy, Florida, has been accused of the sexual abuse and rape of two middle school female pupils . Police are hunting the former head teacher of  a private Islamic school accused of the sexual abuse and rape of two middle school female students. Tariq Ahmad, 35, who worked at Nur-Ul-Islam Academy, Florida, has been charged with five first degree counts after the alleged abuse which left one student needing 'substantial surgical repair'. The girls were  aged 14 and 15 when Ahmad allegedly forced them into sexual relationships, according to a lawsuit. Their attorneys said Ahmed would use text messages, social media and even code on the chalk boards in the classroom to set up meetings with the girls. They also claim the Academy officials knew of Ahmed's illegal conduct for years and did nothing until now. Pembroke Pines police said the alleged incidents occurred between 2006 and 2008, but the pupils only came forward after years of therapy. In a statement, the school said: 'Recently, we have become aware of disturbing allegations regarding a former teacher of Nur-ul-Islam Academy. 'These allegations relate to alleged acts of the teacher six to eight years ago, which did not occur on the school's premise, concerning at least one former student of the Academy. 'Upon learning of these allegations, the Academy immediately suspended the teacher's employment, barred him from any further contact with Academy students and has since terminated his employment with the Academy. 'Although none of the acts are alleged to have occurred on the Academy's campus, such acts, if true, clearly violate the conduct policy of the Academy, along with being a gross dereliction of the high level of moral character the Academy expects from its faculty. 'The Academy's primary concern is to foster a safe and caring environment for all of its students, in which they can flourish personally and academically. A LinkedIn profile in Ahmad's name said he most recently served as the 'head of high school' at the academy, where he started working in August 2006 . 'The Academy, therefore, has undertaken a full review of its policies to determine what, if anything, needs to be done to further ensure the safety of our students. 'In the spirit of Islamic teachings, we offer prayers for the well-being of all our students, current and former.' Attorney Scott Mager said: 'There was significant sexual abuse, intercourse and other inappropriate behaviour such that one of the students had to have substantial surgical repair of that (private) area. It's horrific. 'He would use the chalk board to arraign for times and places to meet victims after school,' said attorney Michael Dolce. The attorneys claim Nur-Ul-Islam Academy officials knew of Ahmed's illegal conduct for years and did nothing until now. 'They knew in 2008. What do they do? Absolutely nothing, expect accuse the kid of doing it. What do they do, they blame, they cover up, they don't tell the parents,' said Mr Mager. Pembroke Pines Police are currently looking for Ahmad who allegedly fled the jurisdiction after he was made aware of his pending charges. Sergeant Carlos Corretjer said: 'There is an investigation, it's still an open case,' Corretjer said. 'We're still trying to locate him.' The attorneys for the two students are asking anyone who may have information as to where Ahmed might be to contact Pembroke Pines Police immediately.

"Sometimes in life you'll say things you always wish you could take back, and for Prime Minster Tony Abbott it happened in an empty football stadium in Penrith last year. It was here on Friday, September 6, 2013, that he gave an interview to SBS World News just before the federal election to reaffirm his party’s pledges to the voters. When asked by interviewer Anton Enus – an experienced, award-winning broadcaster – a straightforward question about cuts to public broadcasters, his answer was clear and unequivocal. Scroll down for video . After SBS World News presenter Anton Enus asked Tony Abbott if there will be any cuts regarding public broadcasters, Mr Abbott's response was an empathic: 'No' ‘I trust everyone has listened to what Joe Hockey has said, last week and again this week: no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST, and, no cuts to the ABC or SBS,’ was Abbott's no-nonsense reply. The sound bite lasted just over 10 seconds, but it’s one that his political adversaries have used relentlessly against him since as it became increasingly apparent that, like many politicians before him, he would not be able to keep his word. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the SBS website clip has now been shared on Facebook more than 8000 times. While YouTube videos of the promises have been viewed more than 110,000 times, spiking sharply after the May budget and continuing to rise. Labor has also mixed the interview into its 'You'll Pay for Abbott's Lies' attack ads. So it came as no surprise when on Wednesday the Communications Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, detailed a $254 million funding cut to the ABC, which means the national broadcaster will receive $5.2 billion over four years, rather than $5.5 billion.

However, Mr Turnbull has defended Abbott's pre-election pledge in Penrith. In an interview on ABC's 7.30 on Wednesday, Mr Turnbull said that he and Treasurer Joe Hockey had made it clear during the election campaign that cuts had to be made and ‘the ABC and SBS couldn't be exempt and that we would be seeking to address waste and inefficiencies’. Despite his pledge, Mr Abbott's government has announced a $254 million funding cut to the ABC, and the SBS will have its budget cut by $25.2 million . While Finance Minister Mathias Cormann also backed his leader saying the revised budget did not amount to a significant cut at all because the ABC had escaped ‘efficiency dividends’ for the past 20 years.

"Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith today accused the BBC of launching a ‘politically-motivated’ attack on government plans to cap benefits at £26,000. In an extraordinary on-air blast, the Work and Pensions Secretary accused the Corporation of using ‘lots of little cases’ to claim that limiting welfare payments would not get people back to work. The confrontation live on Radio 4’s Today programme marks a significant escalation in the political row between Mr Duncan Smith and the BBC over reforms to the benefits system. Clash: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith (left) accused BBC presenter John Humphrys of using politically-motivated cases to undermine his welfare reforms . From today the maximum amount of benefits a family can claim will be capped at £26,000 a year – a figure equal to a pre-tax salary of more than £34,000. A poll today reveals that almost three-quarters of the public back the cap, with two-thirds saying it will help get people on benefits back into work. Mr Duncan Smith was grilled by BBC presenter John Humphrys, after the Today programme aired an interview with one benefits claimant who said she did not want to leave her home in London to find work. As the debate heated up, Mr Duncan Smith insisted many working people who commute long distances every day. He added: ‘The reality is there are plenty of families out there working and paying their taxes who will be asking this question: “Why are we arguing about this, why having a debate as to whether or not somebody should be earning more than they are on welfare payments not working?”’ Mr Humphrys intervened to argue: ‘But that’s not the point I am putting to you.’ Mr Duncan Smith then tore into the BBC’s attempts to undermine his reforms. He hit back: ‘No, cos what you are doing as always happens in the BBC is seeking out lots of little cases from people who are politically motivated to say this is wrong.’ Mr Humphrys said: ‘There are facts and beliefs and you can believe whatever you like.’ The minister responded: ‘The facts we have got, the fact is that people will not be earning more than average earnings sitting out of work unless they are in the exempt categories. ‘The way to resolve that is to go back to work, to earn your money so that as a result of that you no longer are capped. This is the incentive to take the right choices, it’s fair to taxpayers.’ Incentive: People told their benefits will be capped are already making renewed efforts to find work, Mr Duncan Smith insisted . Under the benefits cap, couples and . lone parents will not receive more than £500 a week under the new cap, . with single people limited to £350 a week. The . coalition argues it is fair on people who do work and pay taxes that . those on state-funded benefits do not receive more than the average . working family. An Ipsos . Mori poll commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions found . that just 11 per cent of the public think the benefits system is working . effectively. Some 59 per . cent said they wanted politicians to do more to cut Britain’s welfare . bill. A total of 74 per cent said they supported the benefits cap. However, . during today’s radio clash Mr Humphrys insisted: ‘We are arguing . because it isn’t working. Nobody argues with the principle, that people . who are capable of working, they should work. ‘The . question is whether your scheme is going to do what it sets out to do, . and the evidence such as it is - admittedly little so far - seems to . suggest it doesn’t work.’ David Cameron blundered on Twitter today when he confused a Cabinet minister with a spoof Twitter account. The Prime Minister, who once warned 'too many tweets might make a tw*t', wrote: We're rolling out a cap on Benefits today - @IDS_MP and I are determined to make work pay.' But @IDS_MP is not Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith but a parody Twitter account based on the minister. The clues should have been there. The account biography includes 'parodia' and the phrase 'chin chin old bean'. The most recent tweet reads: 'I've always supported a Mansion Tax. Your Tax buys my Mansion. Chin chin!' This morning the account reacted to the Prime Minister's gaffe: 'Chin chin Dave. Round mine for a Pimms later?' Mr Duncan Smith, who repeatedly interrupted to insist his reforms are working, responded: ‘I believe we are right. ‘That what we are seeing, and this is the view of lots of people working in Jobcentres. ‘That they are getting people who were notified of the cap, their belief – this is advisers, they talk to me., I have been out on the ground, I have seen it myself, I talk to people actually in the Jobcentres – our belief generally is that they are going to seek work where they might not have sought work.’ Relations between the senior Tory and the BBC deteriorated in April after he was ambushed on air over whether he was challenged over whether he could live on £53-a-week by market trader David Bennett.But questions were later raised about the true level of Mr Bennett's income. Mr Duncan Smith has also heavily criticised the BBC's use of the phrase 'bedroom tax' to describe changes to housing benefit. The government says it is ending the 'spare room subsidy' for people receiving taxpayer support for rooms they do not need. But the Corporation took to using Labour's 'bedroom tax' slogan, which Mr Duncan Smith said was a 'disgrace'. However, charities criticised the introduction of the benefits cap. Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, accused the Government of trying to use a 'blunt instrument' to solve a complex problem. He added: 'The debate around this cap has focused solely on workless adults, but the reality is that children are seven times more likely than adults to lose out. '140,000 children, compared to 60,000 adults, will pay the price as parents have less to spend on food, clothing and rent. 'We fully support efforts to make work pay. But it is not right to do this by putting more children on the breadline. Instead, the Government should do more to help families by tackling the sky high rents in some parts of the UK and making childcare affordable.'","Iain Duncan Smith clashes with Today presenter John Humphrys .

"Consumers who buy Halal-certified products could be funding Islamic extremism, an Australian politician claims. Nationals MP George Christensen has questioned whether shoppers who buy goods with the Halal logo are funding a push for Sharia law or even backing terrorists in an opinion article titled Terror In The Tucker Box on his website. He said it was 'outrageous' his grocery dollars were going towards a 'religious tax' on products with Halal certification, including Vegemite, Corn Flakes and Freddo Frogs. Nationals MP George Christensen has questioned whether shoppers who buy goods with the Halal logo are funding a push for Sharia law or even backing terrorists . 'Worse still, I don't know whether my grocery spend is going to fund extremist versions of that religion or extremist religious activities that I would rather not see in Australia,' Mr Christensen wrote. 'While it’s not terrorism, there is no doubt that halal certification is funding organisations with extremist views and activities in Australia. 'It’s lovely to know a jar of the salty black stuff (Vegemite) is sponsoring the advocacy of robbing women of all of their marital property rights.' In an opinion article titled Terror In The Tucker Box on his website, Mr Christensen said there's no way to know where the funds from Halal-certified goods end up . Mr Christensen says there's no way to know where the funds from Halal-certified goods end up, despite conceding one certifier - Australian Federation of Islamic Councils - builds mosques and funds education programs with the money. The Nationals deputy whip said it was 'entirely feasible' to think some Halal certifiers could be financing groups like Hamas or the Muslim Brotherhood, citing cases in the US where such links were found. Controversy over Halal certification has come to a boil over the past few weeks. Mr Christensen said it was 'outrageous' his grocery dollars were going towards a 'religious tax' on products with Halal certification, including Vegemite . He said with a vast range of products that are now halal approved, like Corns Flakes and Freddo Frogs, it was impossible to escape it . South Australian dairy producer Fleurieu Milk and Yoghurt Company was forced drop its Halal certification after receiving threats on social media. As a result, the company lost a $50,000 deal it had with Middle Eastern airline Emirates. Sales and marketing manager Nick Hutchinson said they pulled the pin due to negative publicity, but hoped the ditched deal wouldn't effect redundancies or lost hours for employees.","Nationals MP George Christensen questioned whether shoppers who buy Halal products are funding a push for Sharia law or backing terrorists .

"National Front president Marine Le Pen - whose party is leading opinion polls, the latest surveys suggest . The National Front is leading opinion polls before France’s European elections next month. The latest poll - a CSA survey for BFMTV and Nice Matin - puts their vote at 24 per cent. This compares to 22 per cent for the UMP opposition and 20 per cent for President Francois Hollande’s Socialist Party. It follows a massive swing to the right in local elections which led to the entire Socialist government resigning earlier this month. Mr Hollande spoke of a ‘moral crisis’ in France, and appointed a new administration. However, his left-wing policies are still failing. Unemployment is spiralling above the 11 per cent mark, as other polls regularly show Mr Hollande’s personal approval rating at less than 20 per cent. This makes him by far the most unpopular head of state in the history of modern France. The National Front (FN) enjoyed unprecedented success in the April elections - taking control of 11 key constituencies, and up to 1200 municipal seats. Most of its gains were in areas of high unemployment and immigration, especially in the south of France and the depressed north. ‘No one can seriously deny this has been a huge victory for us,’ said FN leader Marine Le Pen, who believes they will do even better in May’s European elections. Ms Le Pen is widely credited with having modernised the FN - moving it away from its racist and anti-Semitic roots. She won almost 18 percent of the national vote in the first round of presidential elections two years ago, and has worked hard to ‘detoxify’ other FN members. Her infamous father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founded the FN and has a number of convictions for stirring up racial hatred. President Francois Hollande¿s Socialist Party is currently at 20 per cent. The results follow a drastic swing to the right in local elections - leading to the resignation of the entire Socialist government . Mr Le Pen is now 85, and takes a back seat from the day to day running of the party. Polls have regularly suggested that the FN could win up to a quarter of the popular vote in the European Parliament elections in May, but this is the first time that their vote has appeared higher than the two main governing parties in France. The FN currently has three seats in the European parliament, compared to 11 in 1994. Despite the FN’s widespread popular appeal, they have been viewed as a chance to protest against mainstream parties. The FN currently only has two seats in the French National Assembly, compared to 35 in 1986.","Latest survey shows National Front is leading opinion polls ahead of European elections next month .

"In the wake of the tragic death of a 19-year-old freshman student who killed herself after being outed for appearing in a porn film, Duke porn star Belle Knox has written an open letter expressing her sympathy and revealing how she too has come close to suicide. Knox, 18, whose real name is Miriam Weeks, wrote that she saw many parallels between her story and that of Alyssa Funke who took her own life last month after being mercilessly taunted over her decision to appear in a porn film. Knox, a women's studies major, made headlines earlier this year when one of her classmates outed her secret life as a porn star to the student body. Scroll down for video . In an open letter, Belle Knox, left, has written that she saw many parallels between her life and that of Alyssa Funke, right, who killed herself last month after being mercilessly taunted over appearing in a porn film . She wrote on xoJane that she would see ‘chilling’ parallels between Funke's story and her own. ‘When I first heard your story, my eyes immediately filled with tears,’ she wrote. ‘That could’ve been how it all ended for me, too, I thought to myself.’ ‘We were both straight A students. Like you, I have battled depression for years. I too was a freshman in college when I was outed as a porn performer. ‘We even shot for the same website, [CastingCouch-X] where I had an experience that traumatized me to this day. And, just like you, I was bullied relentlessly by my fellow students for my actions as a porn performer.’ Knox writes that she also considered killing herself, even imagining the headlines that would haunt her bullies forever, but felt ‘a flicker of hope’ that caused her to keep going. Knox, a women's studies major, made headlines earlier this year when one of her classmates outed her secret life as a porn star to the student body . ‘You have shown me the other side of the tunnel, an ending I must never forget I could have just as easily taken.’ Knox doesn't blame the porn industry for Funke's suicide, but rallies against the stigma against porn and sex work that gives rise to cyber-bullying. ‘I wish I could have done something,' writes Knox, before going on list what she wishes she had been able to tell Funke before her death. 'I would have told you that it does get better, past the darkness - and that the ignorance of some asinine college students today would have no significance in your life in a few years, when you were a successful, bad-ass anesthesiologist just like you said you were going to be. 'You were an intelligent, beautiful, and compassionate young lady who, despite what everyone told you, did not ruin her life when you shot that scene.' Stunningly beautiful, straight-A chemistry student Funke took her own life with a 12-gauge shotgun on April 16, just weeks after she dabbled in the seedy world of amateur porn and was mercilessly taunted for her decision. Funke went to Las Vegas for her interview with CastingCouch-X in March where she called herself Stella Ann. She appeared nervous on the tape and talked about her real dreams of becoming an anesthesiologist . Miss Funke decided to take part in a sex video with a stranger in Las Vegas for website CastingCouch-X, using the name 'Stella Ann'. Days after the sex tape of the teenager, from Stillwater, Minnesota, was posted online in March, abusive messages flooded her social media accounts, many from her former schoolmates at Stillwater High. The messages, ranged from gossipy and sarcastic to nasty slurs about the University of Wisconsin student. High school students had reportedly gathered around tables in the cafeteria to watch the teen's sex tape on their cellphones, according to KMSP-TV. One called Miss Funke a 'thot', a slang word for prostitute, adding: 'Does her dad know?' Another message sniped: 'Nothing brings a school together like a porn star who graduated last year.' Miss Funke fought back - defending herself. She tweeted: 'Pornstar status' and 'FAMOUS for dayzzzzz.' During her interview for the amateur porn site in March, Alyssa Funke, who called herself 'Ann' looked nervous and described her college plans and described her childhood as 'pretty much normal' The last message she posted on . Facebook on March 4 read: 'The people that envy & hate you the most, . stalk you on social media the most so, hey hi hello how r u doing, this . ones for you.' She wrote a . post to her 'future husband' and about vulnerable message about wanting a . relationship where you 'never feel unwanted or alone'. The 19-year-old did not know the easiest of childhoods, despite describing her past with a shrug in her porn video interview as 'pretty much' normal. Her biological father Rashad Bowman was jailed in 2001 for fraud in Maricopa County, Arizona. Court records show that as a young girl, Alyssa tried to keep in contact with her father using audio tapes. The teenage college student had a troubled upbringing with her father in jail in Arizona and her mother and a boyfriend arrested for dealing drugs . Her mother and a boyfriend were . charged with drug-dealing. Family told KMSP-TV that the teenager had . money worries and struggled with depression. Despite . brushing off the taunts from her peers, the words affected her, family . said. On April 17, the teenager bought a shotgun, drove to Big Carnelia . Lake and killed herself on her family's boat. Her devastated family, who have been unwilling to speak publicly on her tragic death, launched The Alyssa Stop Bullying Fund, which raised just $165. On the site, a family message reads: 'On Wednesday April 16, at the young age of 19 Alyssa Funke took her . own life. Alyssa like so many other teens was a victim of bully and . sadly the bullying lead to her death.' According to KMSP-TV, Miss Funke's video remains on their website. Attempts to contact the site have so far been unsuccessful. The local sheriff's office is investigating the teenager's death but does not believe that the messages sent to Miss Funke amount to criminal harassment.

"A mother who lost 19 stone thanks to weight loss surgery she now bitterly regrets the operation after it left her in constant pain and with less confidence than before. Kelly Urey, 30, now suffers from crippling stomach pains which leave her barely able to eat, meaning she is constantly frail and tired. She has also left with unsightly excess skin, which she says makes her feel less confident than when she was obese. Despite several medical consultations, doctors cannot find anything wrong with her - and say the the problem is all in her head. Kelly Urey, 30, ballooned to 26st and eventually doctors recommended her for a gastric bypass operation. She lost 19 stone in 18 months (right). But she now says she deeply regrets the operation  after it left her in constant pain and with less confidence than before . After the gastric bypass procedure, Ms Urey slimmed down to a size eight, but says she has been left with unsightly and saggy excess skin (pictured), making her feel less attractive than before. She claims she is barely able to eat and has shrunk to a skeletal seven stone . Ms Urey shrunk from a size 30 to a size eight dress size in the space of just 18 months. Now weighing a skeletal seven stone, she says she is malnourished and easily exhausted. She said: 'I might look good now - but I feel awful. I don't have as much energy as when I was obese and I actually feel less attractive.' Ms Urey, of Bury, began gaining weight when she was a teenager thanks to her habit of snacking frequently on crisps, chocolate and soft cheese between regular takeaway dinners. She said despite her size she was confident in social situations. She said: 'People saw me as a larger-than-life character. I would often make jokes about my size so others wouldn't get the satisfaction of making fun of me.' When she reached her twenties Ms Urey realised her weight was causing noticeable health issues, including frequent shortness of breath. After consulting a GP and dietician she was put forward for gastric bypass surgery. Doctors warn complications of the surgery include internal bleeding, a blood clot inside the leg (deep vein thrombosis) and a blood clot or other blockage inside the lungs (pulmonary embolism). Despite these potential complications, Ms Urey decided to proceed with the surgery, going under the knife in October 2012. Ms Urey says she was a 'larger than life' character before her bypass (pictured) and actually had more energy . Initially, she was happy losing weight after the surgery, but soon found eating was so painful she needed painkillers with each meal . She said: 'I was nervous. Any surgery is nerve-racking but it was the end result which concerned me the most.' After her gastric bypass Ms Urey was initially pleased with her weight loss, but as the pounds tumbled away she became less and less fond of her new physique. She discovered even the smallest of food portions would leave her in immense pain. She said: 'I was happy with how quickly the weight fell off but alarmingly it never slowed down. 'I found every bite of food would knot my stomach in crippling agony and I had to pop a painkiller just to eat a small amount of scrambled egg.' Ms Urey, has been left with nausea, bloating, cramping, diarrhoea,dizziness, and fatigue. She has also been left with unsightly and uncomfortable excess skin. She said: 'I'm just too weak. I thought I would have more energy but I'm in too much pain now. ' Ms Urey says she has been left with bloating, cramping, diarrhoea, dizziness, fatigue . When Ms Urey realised the extent of her discomfort she decided to seek medical attention. She said: 'I went to the GP but they said they couldn't find anything wrong with me. 'I told them it hurt too much to eat but it was no use. Medics concluded the pain was all in my head. I felt helpless.' Due to her stomach pains Ms Urey can only usually stomach soft foods, preventing her from getting all the nutrients she needs for a healthy diet. Her typical daily diet now consists of two oat bars for breakfast, a piece of fruit and tub of yoghurt for lunch. For dinner she typically eats some salad with flavoured humus or salted popcorn. Despite her health issues, she is looking towards the future, having enrolled in a hairdressing course at Bury College. She said: 'I needed a practical hobby and the hairdressing course gives me a few hours of the day to get away from it all and it will give me some job prospects once my health improves. 'I have to stop over-thinking things, I have to stop looking at food and getting worried about the pain. I just need to make sure I eat my three meals. 'I still wish I had never had gastric bypass surgery. 'I want others to think it through before they go ahead with such procedures.' The NHS recently reported that the number of gastric bypasses performed in the UK has gone up by 530 per cent in the last six years. A gastric bypass is where the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach so a person digests less food and it takes much less food to make them feel full . Privately, it costs £9,500-15,000, but is available on the NHS to to treat people with potentially life-threatening obesity. It is offered when other treatments, such as lifestyle changes, haven't worked. People with a gastric bypass will lose around two-thirds of their excess body weight . They will need to stick to a rigorous and lifelong plan afterwards to avoid putting weight back on or long-term complications. This plan will include a carefully controlled diet and regular exercise. There are known risks to the surgery, including internal bleeding, a blood clot inside the leg (deep vein thrombosis) and a blood clot or other blockage inside the lungs (pulmonary embolism) The rapid weight loss may cause relationship problems, for example with a partner who is also obese, and it may lead to unwanted loose folds of skin, which may need further surgery to correct. Also, many people with mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety, find that these problems do not automatically improve because they have lost weight.

"Clive Palmer has stormed out of an interview but it isn't the first time the Palmer United Party leader has yanked out his earpiece and refused to answer further questions from the ABC program. Appearing on Lateline via videolink from the Gold Coast on Thursday night,  presenter Emma Alberici started off the interview about his public spat with Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie. But when asked about an ongoing legal battle with the Chinese Government-owned investment company CITIC Pacific, he refused to continue the interview. Scroll down for video . Clive Palmer has stormed out of another interview with ABC . Ms Alberici said the civil trial brought against him, in which he is accused of dishonesty and fraud, soon turned into a heated discussion between the pair. 'Why did you tell your Chinese clients that you spent $12 million on the management of port facilities when in fact you spent that money on your other companies, yourself and the Palmer United Party?' Ms Alberici said. But Mr Palmer said the allegations were 'not true' and 'it was just a lie'. 'Well that's just not right. How did you spend your salary at the ABC?' he said. Before Ms Alberici said: 'Well did you want me to answer your question?' The Palmer United Party leader appeared on Lateline on Thursday night . Mr Palmer responded: 'Yeah, well how'd you spend it? Well let me - I'm giving you an example. That money was paid as port services. Once it's paid to our company, it's no longer their money, it's our money and how we spend it's our business. Mr Palmer refused to be drawn on the legal battle, persisting the allegations were 'not true' and they have been 'made up'. But the host continued to raise  issues  from court documents, while they both interrupt each other. 'Look, I'm not interested in that document,' Mr Palmer said. When presenter Emma Alberici asked Mr Palmer about the allegations, he refused to continue the interview . He was seen yanking out his earpiece as he waved goodbye . But Ms Alberici said 'Well our viewers may well be interested because it - I wanted to ask you if - you're a public figure, Mr Palmer.

Goodbye. I don't want to talk to you anymore. See you later,' he said.

The men, aged 35 and 39, were arrested today on suspicion of committing a number of sexual offences against underage girls between 1990 and 2001. It comes after the Jay report earlier this year revealed that at least 1,400 children were abused by gangs of men, predominantly of Pakistani origin, in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, between 1997 and 2013. Scroll down for video . The men were arrested following a search of five properties in the Goole area of East Yorkshire (above) today . Forensic experts and police officers could be seen collecting evidence in small, clear bags outside the homes . Today’s arrests were made after search warrants were executed at five properties in the Goole area of East Yorkshire. Police said attempts are currently being made to transfer the men to South Yorkshire for interview. The arrests come Professor Alexis Jay’s report into historic sex abuse in the South Yorkshire Town in which she criticised the way in which police and Rotherham Council dealt with complaints from teenage girls who said they had been raped and trafficked by gangs of mainly Asian men. The controversy that followed the publication of the report led to a series of high-profile resignations including Rotherham council leader Roger Stone, council chief executive Martin Kimber and council director of children's services Joyce Thacker. The most high-profile resignation was that of South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright, who was the Rotherham councillor overseeing children's services between 2005 and 2010. He had defied demands from political leaders of all parties to resign and refused to see why he should take any blame before later having a change of heart and quitting ‘for the sake of the victims’. South Yorkshire's chief constable David Crompton has also been under pressure to explain his force's attitude towards child sexual expolotation over the last 15 years. Earlier this week, further details emerged of how police turned a blind eye to the horrific crimes and even blamed the young victims. Police executed search warrants at five properties before arresting two men in connection with historic child sexual exploitation. Attempts are currently being made to transfer the men to South Yorkshire for interview . One police officer could be seen searching a black car outside one of the properties in Goole earlier today . A number of incidents have now been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which is investigating 14 former and serving police officers. Two of the incidents referred to the watchdog involve police arresting the victims of reported abuse while no action was taken against alleged offenders. In one case, a mother of an alleged victim was told it would breach her 13-year-old daughter's human rights to examine her mobile phone, following interactions with 150 Asian men. The spotlight first fell on Rotherham in 2010 when five men, described by a judge as 'sexual predators', were given lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex. The five men - Umar Razaq, Adil Hussain, Razwan Razaq, Zafran Ramzan, and Mohsin Khan - preyed on their victims over several months and threatened them with violence if they refused their advances. One of the men branded his victim a ‘white bitch’ when she resisted, while a second smirked: ‘I’ve used you and abused you.' The men, all British-born Pakistanis, attacked the four girls in play areas, parks and in the back of their cars, Sheffield Crown Court heard. The damning Jay report published earlier this year revealed that at least 1,400 children were abused by gangs of men, predominantly of Pakistani origin, in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, between 1997 and 2013 . Today’s arrests were made after search warrants were executed at five properties in Goole, East Yorkshire . They gave them gifts and introduced them to their friends. The girls were abused so frequently that after many months it ‘became a way of life’. The girls, who were being monitored by social services, were eventually rescued by police and removed from their homes amid growing concerns for their safety. In her report, Professor Jay said senior police and council officials must have known what was happening but failed to act, with staff reluctant to report their concerns out of fear of being called racist. Children as young as 11 were trafficked, beaten, and raped by large numbers of men between 1997 and 2013, the council commissioned review into child protection revealed. More than a third of the cases were already know to agencies, but according to Professor Jay: 'Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist'. She condemned the 'blatant' collective failures by the council's leadership, concluding: 'It is hard to describe the appalling nature of the abuse that child victims suffered.' In her report, Professor Alexis Jay (pictured) said  police and council officials must have known what was happening but failed to act. The report revealed children as young as 11 were trafficked, beaten, and raped . South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright (pictured), who was the Rotherham councillor overseeing children's services between 2005 and 2010, resigned earlier this year after public outcry . Fears had also been raised by schools over the 16 years but the alerts went un-investigated. Teachers reported seeing children as young as 11, 12 and 13 being picked up outside schools by cars and taxis, given presents and mobile phones and taken to meet large numbers of unknown men in Rotherham or other local towns and cities. The majority of victims believed the perpetrators to be their boyfriend who gave them gifts, alcohol and drugs. Some of the victims still maintain they were not groomed or abused. Analysing the case studies, Professor Jay said many of the children came from dysfunctional families, had parents with addictions, and had suffered domestic or sexual abuse as a child. Anyone with concerns about child sexual exploitation should contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"Earth appears as an insignificant-looking pale blue dot below Saturn's majestic rings in a breathtaking new image from the Cassini spacecraft. The picture was captured on July 19 by the probe's wide-angle camera from a distance of 900 million miles. Magnifying the image five times reveals not only the Earth but also the moon, a fainter smudge to the right of the planet. The images were taken by the Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting the ringed giant since its arrival in the Saturn system in 2004, and astronomer Carolyn Porco, . who oversees the Cassini imaging team at the Space Science Institute in . Boulder, Colorado said: 'The whole event underscores for me our . 'coming of age' as planetary explorers.' A tiny spot: Planet Earth can been seen as just a miniscule star from this enhanced shot of Saturn taken by the NASA spacecraft Cassini nearly 900million miles away . Magnified: An Argentine physicist blew up the images of the Earth to show our planet and the moon as they might look from a telescope from Saturn . This shows the first image of Earth captured from the outer solar system taken by NASA's Voyager 1 in 1990, titled 'Pale Blue Dot' After the event, she tweeted: 'WASN'T IT FABULOUS?! I thought of all of you and all the people around the globe thinking the same thoughts I was. Felt SO connected to everyone. The Earth has only been pictured in images from outer space on two other occasions. The first was  in 1990, when Voyager 1 captured an image . from 3.7 billion miles away. The second occasion was when Cassini took a photo in 2006 from 926 million . miles away. NASA took the image on July 19 because Saturn was backlit by the Sun and Earth was included in the picture. Linda Spilker, Cassini spacecraft lead scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said: 'We can't see individual continents or people in this portrait of Earth, but this pale blue dot is a succinct summary of who we were on July 19.' Cassini snapped the picture on Friday, the same day NASA's Mercury-orbiting MESSENGER probe imaged Earth as well. In that picture, Earth and the moon take up less than a pixel, but appear large because they are overexposed. 'That images of our planet have been acquired on a single day from two distant solar system outposts reminds us of this nation's stunning technical accomplishments in planetary exploration,' said MESSENGER lead scientist Sean Solomon, with Columbia University in New York. The raw images of Earth that arrived . back home from Saturn on Saturday were raw and not easy for the average . layman to decipher. The images showed both wide and narrow-angle views . and different shots were taken with different color filters, . additionally, Cassini moved slightly in between shots. Usually, spacecraft in the far reaches of the solar system don't look back toward Earth to avoid damaging their instruments by direct sunlight. Last week, the sun was temporarily blocked relative to Cassini's line of sight, allowing the U.S. space agency to take the picture. Say cheese! Thousands of people posed for Cassini's pictures - though the gesture was obviously just symbolic . The blue dot of Earth as seen from Saturn appearing as a bright smudge with the fainter moon to its right. The picture was captured from a distance of 898 million miles by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft . Val Klavans, an image processor and social-media leader for the 'In Saturn's Rings' film project, produced an unofficial color image composite of the raw data that was sent back. Guillermo Abramson, a physicist at Argentina's Bariloche Atomic Center, tweeted a zoomed-in shot of Earth - as seen from nearly 900million miles away. Thousands of Earthlings looked up at Saturn and waved at 2.30pm Pacific time on Friday to participate in the symbolic #DayEarthSmiled and #WaveatSaturn campaigns at the time Cassini was shooting the pictures.

Costumed sci-fi fans at Comic Con in San Diego - including a few Storm Troopers from Star Wars - also posed for the pictures. The main purpose of the photograph is to study any changes in Saturn's rings, after an 2006 image showed possible changes. 'A . previous mosaic of the Saturn system Cassini made in 2006 revealed that . the dusty E ring, which is fed by the water-ice plume of the moon . Enceladus, had unexpectedly large variations in brightness and color . around its orbit,' Cassini scientist Linda Spilker said. 'We'll . want to see how that looks seven Earth years and a Saturnian season . later, giving us clues to the forces at work in the Saturn system,' she . said.","Photos taken from Saturn by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft show Earth as a tiny pale blue dot .

"Karl Stefanovic has called for more cultural diversity on Australian television and advised non-Indigenous Australians to 'butt out' from commenting on problems faced by Aboriginal Australians. The Channel Nine Today show host made the comments during an interview with the National Indigenous Television (NITV) channel on Thursday. 'I do believe that there should be more faces,' Stefanovic told NITV. Scroll down for video . Today show host Karl Stefanovic has called for more cultural diversity on Australian television during an interview with the National Indigenous Television (NITV) channel . 'I think that fundamentally white people are pretty bland. They're pretty beige and the more difference you have in colour, in accent, in race, in humour, in belief - I think the richer you are.' The 40-year-old had been invited to speak about the representation of Indigenous Australians in media following a panel discussion on the Today show regarding SBS's recently released documentary series, First Contact. Despite the series' main premise being that six out of 10 white Australians have never met an Indigenous person, the panel of four did not include an Indigenous Australian's opinion in their discussion. When confronted about this fact by NITV, Stefanovic promptly replied: 'there was no thought given to that,' before admitting he had asked himself at the time: 'why are we doing this?'. NITV questioned him about a panel discussion of SBS's First Contact that he took part in which did not include an Aboriginal Australian's opinion. This is despite the show's main premise being that six out of 10 white Australians have never met an Indigenous person . Despite confessing that he did not know how to change the norms of Australian media to include more indigenous voices, the television host called, more generally, for 'white people' to 'stop talking with any degree of expertise' about the problems faced by Aboriginal Australians. 'I don't want to hear from people in the city like myself who are in nice suits and in nice houses and drive nice cars and earn a great wage, talking about what it must have been like for Aboriginal Australians,' Stefanovic said. 'I don't want to hear them talking about or offering their opinions about how to fix a situation that they have no idea about. Stefanovic also said he believed 'white people' should 'butt out' and stop commenting on the problems faced by Indigenous Australians, saying 'For too long I believe white people have been trying to stop the problems of indigenous Australians and they have no idea how to do it' 'For too long I believe white people have been trying to stop the problems of indigenous Australians and they have no idea how to do it. 'We don't know what it's like or what it must be like to live as an indigenous Australian... so butt out.' Stefanovic also opened up about his own experience with different ethnicities during the interview, mentioning that he came from an Icelandic background and went to school in Cairns with peers from a 'melting pot' of cultures.

"A 29-year-old terminal cancer sufferer who had previously spoken of her plan to take her life on November 1 has had a change of heart. In a video released on Wednesday, Brittany Maynard said she hasn't decided when she'll end her life, but it remains a decision that she's determined to make before getting too ill. ‘I still feel good enough and I still have enough joy and I still laugh and smile with my family and friends enough that it doesn't seem like the right time right now,’ she said. Scroll down for video . Brittany Maynard released a video on Wednesday in which she said she hasn't decided when she'll end her life, but it remains a decision that she remains determined to make before getting too ill . ‘But it will come, because I feel myself getting sicker. It's happening each week.’ Maynard has stage IV glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer and in April doctors gave her just six months to live. The newlywed recently managed to tick visiting the Grand Canyon off her bucket list after previously announcing that it was one place she hoped to visit before she died. On Friday, she had revealed on her website that she had managed to travel from her home in Oregon to Arizona with her husband, mother and stepfather 'thanks to the kindness of Americans around the country who came forward to make my ""bucket list"" dream come true'. In her latest statement, a video produced by end-of-life choice advocacy group Compassion & Choices, she acknowledges that some people have been skeptical about her story. 'When people criticize me for not waiting longer, or, you know, whatever they've decided is best for me, it hurts,' she said, 'because really, I risk it every day, every day that I wake up.' Maynard also revealed that her health has been deteriorating and described a recent 'terrifying' day when she had two seizures and found herself unable to say her husband's name. 'I think sometimes people look at me and they think. ""Well you don't look as sick as you say you are,"" which hurts to hear, because when I'm having a seizure and I can't speak afterwards, I certainly feel as sick as I am,' she said. Maynard had previously said that she planned to take the medication she'd been prescribed on November 1 because she wanted to celebrate her husband's birthday on October 30. Now she says she's waiting to see how her symptoms progress, but her greatest fear is taking too long to make the choice. Dream trip: Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old cancer sufferer who will end her life on November 1, is pictured with her husband Dan at the Grand Canyon - a trip she had hoped to take before her death . Happy memories: Maynard, second right, and her husband were joined by her mother and stepfather . 'The worst thing that could happen to me is that I wait too long because I'm trying to seize each day,' she said, 'but I somehow have my autonomy taken away from me by my disease because of the nature of my cancer.' She hopes to be surrounded by her husband, mother, stepfather and best friend when she does it. After her recent visit to the Grand Canyon, Maynard had written on her website in glowing terms about the experience. 'The Canyon was breathtakingly beautiful, and I was able to enjoy my time with the two things I love most: my family and nature,' she wrote. Images taken at the Canyon show her kissing her husband, Dan, and embracing her mother and stepfather, grins across their faces. Final days together: Maynard, who is an only child, is pictured with her mother, Deborah Ziegler, on the trip . But just a day after the experience, she suffered her 'worst seizure thus far', which left her temporarily paralyzed and tired for the rest of the day. 'The seizure was a harsh reminder that my symptoms continue to worsen as the tumor runs its course,' she wrote. She finished the post by saying she found meaning in her battle for other states to implement right-to-die laws, as Oregon and four other state already have. 'My dream is that every terminally ill American has access to the choice to die on their own terms with dignity,' she wrote. 'Please take an active role to make this a reality.' Maynard gained nationwide attention after she shared a heart-wrenching video that explained  why she was choosing to end her life at age 29 - while campaigning to expand right-to-die laws. Debilitating: A scan shows the Glioblastoma multiforme that would claim her life slowly within 14 months . Brittany Maynard launched an online video campaign for Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life non-profit organization, to promote death-with-dignity laws, which currently exist in only five states. Washington, Oregon, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico  allow people to die on their own terms, but Maynard says it is not enough. ‘Right now it's a choice that's only available to some Americans, which is really unethical,’ she said. Working through her foundation, The Brittany Fund, Maynard wants other states, like California, New Jersey and Colorado, to consider passing laws that would allow people to make the ultimate choice - life or death. Since Oregon lawmakers passed the Death with Dignity Act in 1997, more than 1,170 people have obtained prescriptions under the law, and fewer than half of them used them to end their lives. She explained that, after suffering intense headaches, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor in January and was initially given 10 years to live, which she said was devastating. But in a scan a few months later, doctors told her the cancer had progressed to Glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive tumor. Sufferers have a life expectancy of around 14 months. When she learned that she would die painfully and slowly, she decided to move from her home in California to Oregon, which has a 'Death with Dignity Act'. After releasing her video, critics lambasted her as selfish, but in an interview with CBS she said she was suffered immense pain - and wished she didn't have to be making the decision. Maynard said her biggest regret is that she will never get to have a family. 'I'd say most of my sadness centers around how much I wanted a family,' Maynard told CBS This Morning. 'And it feels like for me, that was always, like, how you created a legacy was, like, through your children. And sort of inadvertently - through sharing my story, I've realized there's a bit of the legacy I'm creating this way and I'm not ashamed of that. I'm not ashamed to attach my name to what I think is a right that should belong to all terminally ill Americans.' 'I don't want to die,' Maynard explained. 'If anyone wants to hand me, like, a magical cure and save my life so that I can have children with my husband, you know, I will take them up on it.' Time cut short: She is pictured with her husband, Dan. He said he is devastated he cannot spend the rest of his life with her, but understands she wants quality of life over quantity . The couple on their wedding day a year ago. Dan spoke of how sad he is that he will not get to spend the rest of his life with the woman he married . She also has made a deal with her mother, Debbie, that if she travels to Machu Pichu in Peru after her passing, Brittany’s spirit will meet her up there among the breathtaking Inca ruins. In the same interview, Debbie, who raised Maynard on her own, talks about the discussion she had about her daughter when she learned of her decision. 'Early on, I told her, ""It would be my honor to take care of you, whichever way; if you need to be fed or diapered, it would be my honor,""' she said. 'And that was important for me, for her to know.' Maynard's husband, Dan Diaz, also spoke about how sad he is that he will not get to spend the rest of his life with the woman he married little over a year ago. 'That was the original plan, right?' he said. 'But the reality that, I guess, that feeds into the argument of quality of life versus just quantity.' She hopes to be surrounded by her husband, mother, stepfather and best friend .","Brittany Maynard, 29, had previously planned to legally end her life on November 1 - before she loses her battle with terminal brain cancer .

"Most of us boast Facebook friends that number in the hundreds but a new study has found that online friendships bear little resemblance to the real deal. Being counted as a real friend means meeting up at least twice a month and indulging in eight phone chats over the same period. What's more, friendships must last for at least three years before best friend status can be conferred. Britons actually have a very strict criteria for whom they consider to be considered a close friend . The findings are the result of a new study which looked at the impact of social media on offline friendships. Far from boosting friendship, the study found that the majority of Britons only speak to one in nine of their Facebook friends on a regular basis. The 2,000 adults asked also said that in order to qualify as a real friend, shared experiences such as holidays and weddings are essential, as are shared life events such as pregnancies. Friends should also know plenty about each other, including who their first lover was and what their favourite food is. Real friendship requires speaking on the phone or texting up to eight times per month . Men had lower expectations in terms of how often they speak to and see close friends, with the majority claiming to see their best friends less than once a month. People aged between 24 and 35 have the most close friends, with 10 apiece, while those aged between 56 and 65 had the fewest. Those living in Leeds are the most popular in Britain, with one in five boasting more than 10 close friends. Meanwhile, Glaswegians are the least popular, where a paradoxically lonely one in five claim to have no one they consider to be close friends. Buying thoughtful presents at key times like Christmas and birthdays, along with gifts to commemorate weddings, new babies, new homes and wedding anniversaries, was also considered important, with an average spend of £25 per occasion. More 25-34 year olds reported having more than 10 close friends than any other age group . 'These days, most people spend a lot of time keeping in touch via social media,' said a spokesman for One4All Gift Cards, which commissioned the research. 'But our study shows that this alone does not make for meaningful friendships, and most of us still believe that the traditional values of friendship. 'Spending quality time together, being there for key life experiences and doing thoughtful things such as giving presents on special occasions are the things that really matter to most.'","Real friendship requires eight calls and two meetings a month .

"Terrified Romans living in the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum saw ‘sheets of fire and leaping flames’ as they ran through dark streets carrying torches with pumice stone raining down upon them. The description was penned in a letter by a Roman named Pliny the younger who watched from a safe distance to describe the panic on the fateful day of August 24 in 79AD, which was immortalised beneath ash spewed from the erupting volcano, Mount Vesuvius. Now, French and Italian archaeologists excavating areas of the ancient town of Pompeii have discovered raw clay vases that appear to have been dropped by Roman potters fleeing the disaster. French and Italian archaeologists excavating areas of the ancient town of Pompeii have discovered raw clay vases (pictured) that appear to have been dropped by Roman potters fleeing the disaster . The 10 pots, which were found sealed beneath a later of ash and pumice, appear to have been ready to be fired, Discovery News reported. It looks as if they were dropped as frightened potters saw the smoke and smelt the sulphurous fumes that would have been spewed out by the volcano - and decided to make a run for it. Historical accounts and archaeological evidence show that many Pompeians took to the streets in a bid to leave the city, braving hot ash and pumice stones ejected from Vesuvius, with some collapsing from inhaling poisonous fumes. The 10 pots, which were found sealed beneath a later of ash and pumice, appear to have been ready to be fired. This sketch shows the patternation applied by the potters before they fled their workshop . Roman writer, Pliny the younger, described the panic during the eruption of Mount Vessuvius. Terrified Romans (illustrated) living in the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum saw ‘sheets of fire and leaping flames’ as they ran through dark streets carrying torches with pumice stone raining down upon them, he said . The scene at the pottery, with its abandoned kilns, reveals a terrifying moment frozen in time when the potters decided to evacuate. One of the kilns (pictured left) and a reconstructed broken vase (right) are shown . The pottery was discovered in an area of the town outside its Herculaneum Gate and comprises three rooms housing two large kilns. The scene at the workshop, with its abandoned kilns, reveals a terrifying moment frozen in time when the potters decided to evacuate. Dig director Laëtitia Cavassa, from the Jean Bérard Centre, said: ‘They abandoned the workshop and everything they were doing at that moment.’ An administrator and poet called Pliny the younger watched the disaster unfold from a distance. Letters describing what he saw were found in the 16th century. His writing suggests that the eruption caught the residents of Pompeii unawares. He said that a column of smoke 'like an umbrella pine' rose from the volcano and made the towns around it as black as night. People ran for their lives with torches, screaming and some wept as rain of ash and pumice fell for several hours. While the eruption lasted for around 24 hours, the first pyroclastic surges began at midnight, causing the volcano's column to collapse. An avalanche of hot ash, rock and poisonous gas rushed down the side of the volcano at 124mph (199kph), burying victims and remnants of everyday life. Hundreds of refugees sheltering in the vaulted arcades at the seaside in Herculaneum, clutching their jewellery and money, were killed instantly. As people fled Pompeii or hid in their homes, their bodies were covered by blankets of the surge. While Pliny did not estimate how many people died, the event was said to be 'exceptional' and the number of deaths is thought to exceed 10,000.

Archaeologists found pottery wheels as well as the tools needed to create the elaborate patterns and textures on the pots and vases. They believe that the 10 smashed vessels discovered were intended to be used to hold water and wine. Dr Cavassa said: ‘They are really unique items. The potters made them with clay, embellished them with decorations, and were ready to place them into the kiln when the Vesuvius erupted.’ She explained that the vases are evidence that the workshop was active at the moment of the famous eruption. The city of Pompeii (pictured) is an invaluable resource to historians because so many tiny details of daily life, from food to objects in houses, were preserved by hot ash when Mount Vesuvius destroyed the city .","French and Italian archaeologists found broken 'raw' pots and two kilns .

"Quarterback Tom Brady has the top selling jersey among female NFL fans in four states, but for the ladies of Vermont seem to prefer New Orleans' own Drew Bees. But why should Brees beat out Brady in a state closer to the New England Patriots' home turf? It's possible the Brees beats out Brady in Vermont simply because the Saint has a national following. Dick's Sporting Goods has created a map to show the top selling NFL jersey among female fans in every state . The data, compiled in a map by Dick's Sporting Goods, shows the top selling jersey among women fans in every state. Other top sellers include Brandon Marshall in Illinois, Jason Witten in Texas, and Colin Kaepernick in California. As BDC Wire notes, Both Brees and Brady have similar sales patterns having the top spot in three states that would not normally be consider fan strongholds for their teams. Quarterbacks Tom Brady and Drew Brees each dominate jersey sales among female fans in four states, even in those where their teams are not widely followed . Brady, for example, is a top seller in Wyoming. They also top states that have small populations. There are only 627,000 in Vermont and just 583,000 in Wyoming. For states with smaller populaces, even a handful of jersey sales can tip the scales.","Brady and Brees each top sales in four states .

"A 17-year-old child porn suspect enrolled in an elementary school and pretended to be a 12-year-old using another child porn suspect to pose as his father. Ricardo Javid Lugo, 17,  enrolled at Hurst Hills Elementary School in Hurst, Texas, in August using fake documents while Randy Ray Wesson, 28, posed as his father. The pair allegedly planned to recruit potential victims from the school for both of them. Police said Wesson also admitted to sexually abusing over 100 children between the ages of 7 and 14. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arrested: Randy Ray Wesson, 28, (left)  was arrested on charges of possession with intent to promote child pornography along with 17-year-old Ricardo Javid Lugo who allegedly posed as a sixth grader . According to an arrest affidavit, detectives said Wesson 'confessed that police would find approximately 42,000 child pornography images on his computer, thumb drive, phone and SD cards.' It states: 'Wesson also admitted to sexually abusing over 100 children between the ages of 7-14 years of age. He identified 12 victims by name.' During a search of Lugo's phone, officers found images of 'children at school, dated August 25 through 26, 2014.' Documents also state a video on Lugo's cell phone dated August 31, 2014, shows Lugo spanking a child who appeared in a previous photograph taken at school, reports NBC DFW. Posing: An investigation revealed that Ricardo Javis Lugo, 17, has been enrolled in 6th grade at Hurst Hills Elementary in Texas since August and may have done so to capture child pornography . In one message, Lugo told Wesson that he saw one child's genitals and 'talks about telling other kids not to tell, and having to follow them home to see where they live,' the affidavit said. 'Ricardo tells Randy on September 12, 2013, that a kid told him he has always wanted someone to touch him and invited him over. Ricardo tells Randy, 'He said we could do it if I promise not tell, and I said the same thing,' the affidavit said, reports the Star Telegram. According to the arrest affidavit, Lugo and Wesson met on Instagram in 2013 when Lugo was using the name Matthew and living in Mexico. He apparently told Wesson he was 12-year-old and that he was unhappy at home in Juarez. A few months later - either late February or early March, Wesson drove to El Paso, and took Lugo back to his home in Fort Worth with Wesson. Wesson told investigators he and Lugo have had a sexual relationship since that time. According to the arrest affidavit, Lugo (pictured left and right) and Wesson met on Instagram in 2013 when Lugo was using the name Matthew and living in Mexico . Detectives interviewed Wesson's father Bruce and he told them he had caught his son looking at 'possible' child porn before. He told police his son informed him that Lugo was 12-years-old - he said he was introduced to Lugo in February because his mother didn't want him, according to the affidavit. Bruce told detectives that Lugo wore diapers and was called Matthew Drew Wesson. The investigation started when a online tip was sent to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on June 8 that associated an Instagram account with an email address connected to with Wesson, according to the arrest affidavit. The center's staff searched websites for Wesson's email address and found statements like 'I want to be your daddy, I want to change your diaper,' according to the arrest affidavit. Acting on the tip, police searched Wesson's Fort Worth home and found child porn images. According to a statement from the Hurst-Euless-Bedford Independent School District, Lugo enrolled in August. District officials say Wesson posed as Lugo's father during the process and provided a birth certificate, immunization records, and proof of residency. 'Hurst Hills staff followed all procedures regarding enrollment when the student was enrolled in August,' the statement read. 'There was no indication that the student's records were forged or that the student was too old to attend elementary school. 'The student's behavior at school also did not raise any concerns.' They have contacted parents of sixth grade students on Wednesday to inform them of the news, and a letter was sent home with all Hurst Hills students. A woman in El Paso positively identified Lugo as her son when a detective showed her a picture of him. In August she posted on Facebook saying her son had been missing from El Paso for the last six months. Wesson faces charges of possession with intent to promote child pornography, sale/display of harmful material and tampering with a governmental record. He was in the Hurst jail Thursday night with bail set at $3 million. Lugo faces charges of possession of child pornography. He was in the Hurst jail with bail set at $250,000.","Ricardo Javid Lugo, 17, enrolled at Hurst Hills Elementary School in Hurst .

"A milkman was sacked after he appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show accused of cheating on his wife while he was on his rounds. Shaun Dadds, 44, took lie detector tests to see if he had been unfaithful to his wife, who was also on the ITV programme in September.

Mrs Dadds, 43, also angered her husband's managers by using the company's slogan 'Milk and More' in a conversation on Jeremy Kyle's programme. She said: 'There was nothing there between us — not just the sex, but no intimacy, no affection. 'I said to him, ""It says you deliver Milk and More but that seems to be the only thing you deliver"".' On the show, Mr Dadds took lie detector tests to determine whether he had 'sexual contact', 'sexual interaction' and 'passionate kissing' with another woman while he was in a relationship with his wife.

"A new vaccine designed to protect against the human papilloma virus prevents 90 per cent of cervical cancers, scientists have claimed . The vast majority of cervical cancers could be prevented thanks to a new vaccine designed to target the human papilloma virus, scientists claim. The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, Gardasil, which protects against only two cancer-causing types of HPV. In the UK, the current vaccine is offered to girls aged 12-13; in the US, HPV vaccines are offered to those aged 11 and 12. The new jab protects against nine strains of the virus, seven of which cause most cases of cervical cancer. Scientists at Queen Mary University in London  found the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is 97 per cent effective at protecting against high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease caused by five types of HPV. It is also as effective as the current vaccine in preventing diseases triggered by four HPV strains. Scientists examined the vaccine's effectiveness when given to more than 14,200 women, aged 16 to 26 years old. Professor Jack Cuzick from the university, who co-authored the study, published in  the New England Journal of Medicine, said: 'This is a significant achievement. 'The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. 'Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset. He added: 'Gardasil 9 offers the potential to increase overall cervical cancer prevention from 70 to 90 per cent, nearly eliminating this cancer among vaccinated women. 'However, it's crucial to remember that vaccination must be done before exposure to the virus. 'Our focus for prevention must be on girls aged 12 to 13, as the current UK vaccine programme is doing, but the vaccine may also be appropriate for women 25 to 45 as part of a screening appointment.' Until late last year there were just two vaccines available globally to protect against HPV related diseases. In the UK, Gardasil is used to protect against four types and offers around 70 per cent protection against cervical cancer. It also significantly reduces the risk of other types of cancer and genital warts. However, scientists have been trying to find a way of completely eliminating cervical cancer and other HPV related diseases by adding five more cancer-inducing HPV strains. Gardasil 9 marks an important step in that direction, the researchers said. HPV is the most commonly sexually transmitted virus. Many people who are infected clear the virus from their systems with no lasting health complications and most types of the virus are low risk, causing warts or verrucas. Gardasil is given to girls aged 12 and 13 as a vaccination against HPV. But the new version, Gardasil 9 is a 'significant achievement' experts said, adding it will mean fewer women need to take part in screening programmes in future . But other types are deemed high risk, causing cervical cancer, and in fewer cases vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal and throat cancers. The majority of cervical cancer cases occur as a result of infection with high risk strains of HPV. Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common cancer in women across the world, with more than half a million cases and 250,000 deaths each year worldwide. In the UK around 3,000 women a year are diagnosed with cervical cancer and in 2011 there were around 970 deaths. In Britain all girls aged 12 to 13 are offered the HPV vaccine as part of the NHS Childhood vaccination programme. Professor Cuzick added: 'Following these important findings, this vaccine has been licensed in the USA and approval is currently being sought in the UK and other countries. 'It is encouraging that the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation is reviewing Gardasil 9 in light of this new evidence.' Last December, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Gardasil 9 for use in girls aged nine to 26 and men aged nine to 15. Around 3,000 cases of cervical cancer, pictured under the microscope, are diagnosed each year in the UK . What is HPV? The human papilloma virus is the name given to a group of viruses that affect a person's skin as well as the membranes lining the body - for example, in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat. HPV is very common and highly contagious. More than three quarters of sexually active women acquiring it at some point in their lives. And in the U.S. it is the most common sexually-transmitted infection. The human papilloma virus is a group of more than 100 viruses that affect a person's skin, and membranes lining the cervix, anus, mouth and throat . Most people are oblivious to the fact they have been infected and as a result can pass it on to a partner without realising. There are more than 100 types of HPV - around 40 of which affect the genital area. What does HPV infection do? The majority (nine in 10) of infections disappear of their own accord within two years. But the other 10 per cent of infections can cause health problems, including: . The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different to those infections that cause cancer. Other HPV infections can cause more minor problems, including common skin warts and verrucas. How do people get HPV? HPV is a sexually-transmitted infections. In most cases a person will become infected after having vaginal and/or anal sex. Men and women can also become infected through oral and other sex play. In many cases a person will not realise they are infected, and can still have HPV years after coming into contact with an infected person. In very rare cases a pregnant woman can pass HPV to her baby during delivery. In these cases a child can develop recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), a rare condition where warts grow in the throat. The HPV vaccine . A national vaccination programme for HPV is in place in the US and UK for girls aged 12 and 13. Three injections are given within a 12-month period by a nurse. The vaccine is given at a young age because it needs to be administered before a person comes into contact with HPV. It has also been found to provide greater immune response in preteens, than it does in older teenagers and young women. Clinical trials have showed the vaccines provide close to 100 per cent protection against precancers and for HPV4 - genital warts. Since it was first recommended in 2006, there has been a 56 per cent reduction in HPV infections among teenage girls in the US. Protection offered should be long-lasting, with trials showing the vaccine lasts in the body for at least 10 years. HPV vaccination does not replace the need for regular cervical smear tests in women between the age of 25 and 65.

"As a demonstration of how well-drilled New York City officials are in how to deal with Ebola, it left a lot to be desired. Two New York City police officers who attended the Harlem apartment building of Dr Craig Spencer - the first confirmed Ebola case in the city - were observed afterward dumping their protective gear and caution tape in a garbage bin on the street. While it was not immediately clear if the two officers had been inside Dr Spencer's apartment, the episode had many people asking if the equipment should not have been disposed of in a biohazard bag - even if only as a precaution. Scroll down for video . Is that where that goes? The NYC police officers marking off the area around Dr Craig Spencer's apartment in Harlem earlier this afternoon . No but really, should that go there?: The men were seen throwing caution tape along with their masks and gloves in a trash can . Are we really doing this?: Not just any trash can, but one on a public street corner . Jitters spread through New York on Thursday after it was revealed Dr Spencer spent seven days in the city after returning from Africa with the Ebola virus in his bloodstream. On Tuesday, Dr Spencer described suffering from fatigue and exhaustion. He took the subway from his home in Harlem to popular tourist spot the High Line, a park created on a disused railway line in Chelsea. He stopped at Blue Bottle Coffee stand and then had lunch at The Meatball Shop in Greenwich Village. On Wednesday morning, the doctor went running for three miles on Riverside Drive and the Westside Highway in Manhattan. That evening, he took the subway to The Gutter bowling alley in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He later took an Uber cab ride home to Harlem. The doctor was not advised to quarantine himself for 21 days on his return to the U.S. but had been monitoring his temperature twice a day. While officials say he had no symptoms at the time of these activities and was therefore almost surely not infectious, many New Yorkers are worried all the same. Dr Spencer, whose case was confirmed Thursday evening, had been in Guinea this past September with Doctors With Borders, helping to treat patients infected with the virus. Keeping it covered: It is uncertain if the men were at any point in the apartment on Dr. Spencer . Unlucky passersby: These folks are likely unaware of what is happening . Get it all in there: The men discarded everything in the trash can . New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio reminded the public in his press conference tonight that, 'Ebola is an extremely difficult disease to get,' then adding that, 'Every hospital in the city is prepared in the event other patients come forward.' However, New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo, speaking at the same press conference, said four people were potentially exposed to Dr. Spencer 'during the relevant period.' They are Dr Spencer's fiancee, two friends, and the driver of a taxi he rode in. There was no word during the press conference as to how prepared police officers were to deal with the deadly virus. Dr Craig Spencer rode the subway along with visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley, The Gutter, and the High Line park. It was revealed today that he had also eaten at The Meatball Shop in Greenwich Village and stopped at Blue Bottle Coffee on the High Line on Tuesday . September 16: Dr Craig Spencer flew to Guinea to treat Ebola patients as a member of the French organization Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontiers).

Walked on High Line and stopped at the Blue Bottle Coffee stand (10th Ave & W 16th St) At around 5:30 PM, he got off the High Line at 34th Street and took the 1 train to the 145th Street station. October 22: At around 1:00 PM, Dr Spencer went running along Riverside Drive and Westside Highway. Around 2:00 PM, he went to pick up Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm share at 143rd St and Amsterdam Avenue (Corbin Hill Farm) and picked up a box which he took to his apartment. At around 5:30 PM, Dr Spencer left for The Gutter bowling alley in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with two friends. For his arrival at Gutter, he took the A train at 145th Street and transferred at 14th Street and took the L train to Bedford Avenue. Around 8:30 PM, Dr Spencer left The Gutter. For his return trip, he used Uber as his means of transportation. October 23: Around 10:15AM, he first reported a fever. At this point, he called Medecins Sans Frontieres and the New York City Health Department. He was immediately taken to Bellevue by FDNY EMS.

"Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes has a policy of not having real-life political figures make guest appearances on her Washington, D.C. based political thriller. But the powerhouse producer told E! News last week that she would be willing to make an exception for philandering president Bill Clinton. 'That's not really our thing, but I will say, ""Bill Clinton, if you're out there, we would love to have you…We would always love to have you,"" 'she said. Casting Call: Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes says she'd love to have former President Bill Clinton make a cameo on the show . Like Scandal's fictitious President, Fitzgerald Grant, played by Tony Goldwyn, Bill Clinton was publicly shamed during his presidency for knocking boots with a White House staffer. After infamously claiming he never had sexual relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky in January of 1998, Clinton, who was then in the second year of his second term, admitted in an August 1998 televeised address that he did in fact have an improper sexual relationship with Lewinsky. Rhimes' twisted political drama, which is gearing up for its fourth season, is not a dramatization of Clinton's time in office, however. Grant is a Republican, and the show is very loosely based on the administration of Republican President George H.W. Bush, who held office for one term from 1988 - 1992. The character played by actress Kerry Washington, former White House communications aide and presidential mistress Olivia Pope, was inspired by former Bush administration aide Judy Smith, who now runs a high-end crisis communications shop in Washington, D.C. Smith also serves as a co-producer on Scandal. Real-life fixer Judy Smith (left) and her . on-camera counterpart Kerry Washington (right) pictured here at . Variety's 5th Annual Power of Women event presented by Lifetime in . October 2013, where Washington had just won an award for her portrayal . of Olivia Pope on Scandal . At a Scandal-themed Politico Playbook breakfast held in concert with the White House Correspondents dinner in early May, Bush's former Transportation Secretary, Andrew Card, said that Smith called up her former boss to forewarn him about the racy content of the show and he teased her about the on-air affair and said he was 'honored' to be the inspiration for Scandal's hunky president. President Bush and Smith were not romantically involved like their on air counterparts but the sex-filled side plot between Pope and the POTUS in Scandal makes for a juicer storyline. Neither the Bush administration nor the Clinton administration made a habit of killing anyone who stood it its way, either, a common remedy for political problems that arise in Scandal. 'There are always interesting politicians out there who would be interesting [to have on the show], but our show is a very heightened, very dark view of Washington,' Rhimes told E! News. 'I don't think really Bill Clinton or any of those people belong in our Washington.' Not everything that occurs in Scandal is completely out of the realm of possibility, however. When the press learns of the president's affair with Pope, paparazzi show up at the fixer's door and bombard her with questions about her intimate relationship with the Commander in Chief. Lewinsky was pestered by the press in a similar manner after she was outed as Clinton's former mistress. Ironically, it was Judy Smith who represented Monica Lewinsky during Clinton's impeachment proceedings, which would make an on-set rendezvous between the former president and Smith all the more titillating. It's unlikely that Clinton would want to draw new attention to his sex life by appearing on the show, but much stranger things have happened in politics. The former president hasn't made any cameos in the past, however, Clinton is known to be a fan of the show and may fancy an opportunity to meet the cast and crew.","Shonda Rhimes wants former president Bill Clinton to make a cameo on her hit ABC show, Scandal .

"A mall in Thailand that used to be awash with shoppers is now teeming with fish after the abandoned building was flooded. The New World Mall, in Bangkok, was closed in 1997 after it was found to have breached building regulations, before a fire in 1999 left it without a roof. Rainwater slowly filled the building with water, causing a major mosquito problem. In an effort to rid themselves of the pests, the locals introduced freshwater talapia fish to eat the insects. An abandoned mall in Thailand has become home to hundreds of fish after it flooded. Locals introduced the talapia to eat mosquitoes which had been attracted by the stagnant water . Meant as a simple pest control measure, the talapia have now thrived and hundreds of them can be seen swimming in the strange urban pond . The New World Mall was closed in 1997 after it was found to have breached building regulations and a fire in 1999 destroyed the roof allowing rainwater in . The fish thrived, quickly multiplied, and now fill the lower floors of the mall, swimming around rusty escalators and across the 5,000sqft floor. Shops around the mall sell fish food to tourists who visit, but throwing anything else into the subterranean lake is banned in order to protect the aquatic inhabitants. Backpacker Jesse Rockwell, 30, stumbled across the deserted mall while travelling in Thailand. He said: 'It is quite bizarre - I was really surprised when I came across it. It is literally three blocks away from backpacker central, but nobody is even aware it is there. As the water level rose, the locals noticed it was attracting mosquitoes and so introduced the freshwater talapia fish in order to eat the pests . The mall was closed after it was found to be seven floors taller than the original building plans allowed . 'It was very quiet in the mall, I could only hear the sound of splashing fish, even though it's close to a main road.' Mr Rockwell, from Santa Rosa, California, USA, added : 'A sign written in Thai outside says 'Do not throw anything into the water' - so people are trying to protect the fish.' New World Mall, found on Bang Lam Pu Junction in Bangkok's old town, was built in the 1980s. The company that built the mall was found to be in breach of building regulations as the 11-storey mall was seven floors taller than the approved construction blueprint. Local shops sell fish food for visitors to throw to the fish, but tossing anything else in the lake is banned as residents try to protect the animals from coming to harm . From outside the mall, it is impossible to tell that there is a lake of fish inside and it is one of the lesser-known tourist attractions in Thailand . The mall was forced to close in 1997 and was set ablaze in 1999, leading to its partial demolition. The fifth to eleventh floors were later dismantled so the empty shopping centre was in line with the original  construction plans. Mr Rockwell, a chef, said: ""Some people think it was set ablaze because it was too tall. Lots of people in old town Bangkok think it is insulting to build something taller than The Grand Palace. 'So when the mall was built people got really angry.'","New World Mall in Bangkok, Thailand, flooded after fire destroyed roof .

It's alleged that over the course of several days in May, Morrison placed over 120 calls to his wife, Ashley, at her home in Darien. The protective order does not require that he stay away from his wife, but it does forbid him from undertaking any harassing activity. Arrested: Former television news anchor Rob Morrison, 46, who lives in Connecticut faces new charges in connection with his arrest last year on domestic violence charges. The former WCBS News anchorman, was arrested again on June 16 . Tempestuous relationship: Ashley and Rob Morrison seen here in 2008 in New York City are still together - despite Mr. Morrison being arrested for a second time on charges of harassment. He was accused of choking his life last year but those charges were dropped . Morrison’s wife, former CBS MoneyWatch anchor Ashley Morrison, went to police 'physically shaking' and in a 'very fragile state' on May 25 to report the alleged harassment, according to the Connecticut Post. She told cops she feared her husband 'could kill her if she got him arrested.' A search of Rob Morrison's cellphone records indicated that over the course of the Memorial holiday weekend, he placed 121 calls to his wife's cellphone and home phone. Most of the calls were made on May 25 when he allegedly called 109 times and 'would hang up and call right back for approximately 14 hours,' police said. The couple have a nine-year-old son together and they were apparently arguing over the possibility of her relocating with him. He said he told her that it wasn't the time to talk about it, saying his son has no idea that a move is in his future. 'We have done a wonderful job of shielding him from what has transpired over the past 16-17 months,' Morrison said to the Stamford Advocate. IN his previous case in which the charges were dropped, Morrison said that he acted badly against his wife and that his court case has been a time of 'personal growth' Initial plea: WCBS Television anchorman Rob Morrison looks on during his arraignment in Superior Court on Tuesday Feb. 19, 2013 in Stamford, Connecticut . He said after a few moments after the heated conversation began, he turned and saw his son standing near the stairs crying. Morrison said his wife then cut off communications, frustrating his efforts to talk to his son. 'There . was no response and I became concerned,' he said. 'I don't want to talk . to Ashley. I need to know my son is OK; what he witnessed, if it . troubled him. We had . long-term plans to go golfing the next day being broken. All he may be . thinking is, `Daddy's gone and he isn't coming back.' ' Over the course of the next couple days Morrison admitted, 'I tried like hell to get in touch with her.' For three weeks after the incident, Morrison said he and Ashley and their son have 'had some wonderful times.' Scene: Rob Morrison's family home in Darien, where it is alleged that he choked wife of 11 years Ashley Morrison and where he made 121 calls over the Memorial Day weekend . 'I had no idea she went to the cops,' he said. 'I still don’t know why.' 'As . far as I’m concerned, it was simply that she was aggravated and angry . that I wouldn’t have that conversation and she decided to put a barrier . between me and my son,' he said. 'I . think that’s an abuse of a protective order that’s put in place to help . people who are in danger or some sort of peril. It’s not meant — . because you’re in a bad mood — to prevent a father from talking to his . son.' Morrison declined to comment if he and Ashley were considering staying together . Morrison . is charged with one count of criminal violation of a protective order . and one count of harassment in the second-degree. He was released after posting a $50,000 bond.

"This is not your typical hot air balloon ride. While most tourists enjoy a tranquil glide through the air while enjoying the sights below, these thrill-seekers instead decided to throw themselves out of a hot air balloon basket and swing to a second  balloon while attached to a rope. YouTube superstar Devin 'Supertramp' Graham and his team filmed the exhilarating moment which combined two seemingly tame activities, the hot air balloon ride and the rope swing, to create one heart-stopping stunt. A hot air balloon ride with a difference: Extreme sports enthusiasts have filmed themselves creating the world's craziest rope swing . Thrill-seekers: YouTube star Devin 'Supertramp' Graham filmed his crew throwing themselves from a hot air balloon . Cinematographer Devin, 31, specialises in extreme sports and adventure videos, pulling off mind-blowing stunts each week in videos watched by over 2.6million subscribers. In this video, Devin filmed his team swinging 180ft though the air and to the ground in the desert outside Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 29. The jumpers each held GoPro cameras, capturing the stunt from different perspectives, while a helicopter was also used to take a bird's eye view of the balloons. Stunt: The jumpers were tied to a rope that was attached to a second hot air balloon . The face of fear: The jumpers captured the moment on GoPro cameras with selfie sticks . The videos were made in collaboration with the Citi Double Cash Card, with the idea of combining two fun activities into a double stunt made epic. The thrilling video has had over 420,000 views since being uploaded one week ago. A behind-the-scenes clip shows Devin and his team setting up for the shoot in the desert, with some team members camping outside in the near-freezing temperature to protect the equipment. Up in the air: Six of the team members braved a swing of 180ft through the air and to the ground . Don't look down: The video was created in collaboration with Citi Double Cash Card . Remote: The stunt took place in the Nevada desert on October 29 . On his blog, Devin, from Salt Lake City, writes that they ran into a number of obstacles when pulling together the stunt, and had to change the plan a few times. His original concept was to create a 'Tarzan' scenario, with the crew swinging from rope to rope across multiple hot air balloons, but it was deemed impossible to pull off. That's when the idea of a rope swing created by jumping out of one hot air balloon while attached to another was born, with the plan calling for the team members to swing into a lake below. But the shoot had to be moved to the desert when the weather conditions became too windy. Despite the obstacles, the end result is undeniably spectacular.","Devin 'Supertramp' Graham filmed stunt in Nevada desert on October 29 .

"Teenagers are taking the illicit drug ecstasy from just 15, with the belief they are completely immune to the dangers of the potentially deadly substance. But these drugs seem to be becoming increasingly dangerous, with reports from users online revealing pills are putting people in hospital and inducing psychotic episodes. This comes just days after the funeral of Sydney teenager Georgina Bartter, who died of a suspected drug overdose after taking 'one and a half' pills at Harbourlife music festival earlier this month. Her family believe it was due to an acute allergic reaction from the drugs. Scroll down for video . Sydney teenager Georgina Bartter died at Harbourlife music festival from a suspected overdose two weeks ago . Paul Dillon, head of Drug and Alcohol Research Training Australia (DARTA) warned that Australian teenagers are taking ecstasy tablets younger than ever. Paul Dillon from Drug and Alcohol Research Training Australia said there was a concerning trend which saw teenagers were taking ecstasy younger . Mr Dillon has been analysing drug trends and working with schools across the country on their substance education programs for many years, also revealed the concerning rates at which young people are consuming pills. 'I go to schools and I see 15-year-olds that are popping ecstasy,' Mr Dillon told Daily Mail Australia. 'Those young people that do use drugs start earlier and doing it in a more dangerous way than before. 'If you take the drug away these are very young people who have no life experience and if something goes wrong they have no idea what to do,' he continued. Head of the NSW drugs squad, Detective Superintendent Tony Cook, agreed telling Daily Mail Australia the young age at which people were consuming these drugs set off alarm bells. 'Its concerning that we have the anecdotes and evidence of very young people taking them,' Superintendent Cook said. However Mr Dillon argued that it was not only the age teenagers were starting to consume the drugs but the way they were consuming them that also raised alarm bells. 'The thing that concerns me is that I am seeing more and young people who are seeing no risk in ecstasy.' He added that teenagers are consuming the drug and completely ignoring the idea that these are potentially deadly substances. Drug community website Pill Reports feature warnings about various dangerous drugs around Australia currently, such as these known as Gold Bars . These claims for experts come just days after Ms Bartter's funeral, held in North Sydney . Drug community website Pill Reports is a forum where users can share information about certain types of pills and warn others about particularly bad batches. Currently the most recent warning exists for a pill known as Gold Bars, which originated in the Netherlands but has made its way to Australia. One user said an imitation of the original tablets from overseas bought in Sydney meant a 'friend ended up in hospital in a psychotic state off of two (ecstasy tablets). 'Do not recommend consumption.' This drug user also said the pill left them feeling unwell, unhappy and unable to sleep. 'Started to trip and feel absolutely terrible, an ominous overhanging feeling that can only be described as weird. Blue pills known as Scissors or Quackers have also caused concern with people already hospitalised after using them . 'Was reduced to sitting down waiting it out, effects lasted pretty far into the next day, felt very unwell and unable to sleep,' the user recounted. A second report on small blue pills known as Scissors or Quackers was also visible online, this time originating from the ACT. Canberra Times report that some have already been hospitalised after consuming them. A similar pill has also been seen in NSW, with users issuing a warning as they did not think the substance contained MDMA - the main ingredient in ecstasy pills. Despite many places online which allow users to share such information, Superintendent Cook had one message for them: drugs kill. Mr Dillon said Ms Bartter's death was tragic but ultimately came down to bad luck, as drugs affect all people differently . 'The bottom line is drugs are illegal and they kill,' he said. He said the death of Ms Bartter plus the overdose of nine others at the festival was tragic, but it reinforced a message he and others had been trying to get across for years. 'There’s no such thing as recreational drugs, people don’t know what they're getting, they don’t know how they're going to react. Mr Dillon echoed these sentiments, saying someone could take a certain pill on day and have a positive experience, but take the same one the next week and have a vastly different reaction. He added that Ms Barrter's death could not have been predicted although it was unlikely she was the only one who consumed the pills she did. Superintendent Cook warned that drugs were unpredictable, and it was tragic that deaths often brought up these conversations . 'I think we'd have to be extremely naive to think that she was the only person who took the drugs that she took. 'The reality is with her death like so many of them ... when it boils down to say why, usually you have to turn around and say bad luck. 'It's a horrible thing to say but it comes down to luck,' Mr Dillon said. When asked about issuing warnings for particularly dangerous drugs, Mr Cook said they do that in certain cases such as earlier this year when a pill called Blue Batmans were making people very ill. However he made clear that the key message was about preventing people from taking any drugs at all and ultimately it would need to come down to social change.","Teenagers are taking drugs younger than ever and in more dangerous ways .

"Joshua Waddington, 21, started a brawl at his sister's wedding, after attacking a couple who were on a romantic break at the same venue . A wedding at a historic country hotel descended into chaos after the groom and his new brother-in-law started a fight with a couple who were staying at the same venue. Jessica Franklin and her husband Ian were celebrating their marriage with friends and family at Bosworth Hall Hotel, Leicestershire, in December last year when the brawl broke out. The drama unfolded after the bride's 21-year-old brother Joshua Waddingham launched an attack on Rebecca Rankin and her fiancé Paul Gurney, who were enjoying a romantic mini-break at the same Grade II listed hotel. Leicester Crown Court heard how the bride desperately tried to pull her loved ones from the brawl as Waddingham and Franklin, 31, began assaulting Mr Gurney. Wedding guests James Sharman, 27, and his 21-year-old wife, Chloe, also joined in with the attack. The court heard how, as the group beat Mr Gurney, Ms Rankin stepped in to protect her fiancé. But Ms Rankin was hit twice by Waddingham, who later kicked her in the head as she fell to the ground. She suffered a bloody nose and black eyes while Mr Gurney sustained a broken ankle, which required two operations. He was unable to walk for six weeks. Waddingham, said to have taken the lead in the attack, was given a two-year jail sentence, suspended for two years. He admitted causing grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm when he appeared at Leicester Crown Court. He was also given 200 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay £1,000 compensation to Mr Gurney and £250 to Ms Rankin. Judge Nicholas Dean QC said: 'This was an utterly disgraceful episode on what should have been a day of happiness for everyone involved.' Prosecutor Sarah Lloyd told the court how the 'atmosphere changed' in the bar of the 17th-century hotel when the victims had a disagreement with wedding guests. Mr Gurney suffered a cut ear in a minor tussle in the toilets before trouble brewed again. He threw a table, which did not hit anyone, 'to protect himself', the court was told. Miss Lloyd said: 'Waddingham punched at Paul Gurney, who fell to the floor. Ian Franklin and James Sharman became involved, kicking and punching him to his head and body as he lay on the floor.' Ms Rankin then intervened in the scuffle, shouting, 'Are you going to hit me now?', the court heard. Miss Lloyd said: 'Waddingham punched her at least twice to the face in quick succession, causing her to fall, where he hit her again and kicked her head. 'As both complainants were laid out on the floor, Chloe Sharman kicked in the direction of their heads on three occasions as the bride attempted to pull the defendants away.' The mayhem took place during a wedding at the Grade II listed mansion Bosworth Hall Hotel, Leicestershire . The three men admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Gurney, while Ms Sharman admitted affray. Franklin and James Sharman were both given 12-month jail sentences, suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work. Each must pay £750 compensation to Mr Gurney. Chloe Sharman was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 100 hours of unpaid work. Judge Dean said to the defendants: 'It may be Mr Gurney and, to an extent, Miss Rankin contributed to what happened, but to a much lesser extent than you.' Gareth Weetman, mitigating for Waddingham, said: 'He's genuinely ashamed. It's unclear who started the second flashpoint - there was aggression on both sides.' Rachel Darby, for Franklin, said: 'It was a combination of drink and emotion. He had a natural desire to protect his wife on her wedding day.' Bosworth Hall Hotel and Spa is set in the Warwickshire countryside and dates back from the 17th century. The Grade II listed building is set in landscaped gardens, and its luxurious rooms can fetch hundreds of pounds a night .","Jessica and Ian Franklin had their wedding at Bosworth Hall Hotel, Leics .

"Veteran fisherman Kim Haskell has been fishing all his life, but had never seen anything like the catch he and his family snagged while out fishing past the Great Barrier Reef. Kim, 64, a fruit grower from Bloomfield, Queensland was on a fishing trip with his brother Jamie and nephew Christopher near Osprey Reef in the Coral Sea, off the Queensland coast. The trio rose early and had already caught several tuna off the side of the 18 meter boat when Christopher reeled in an enormous dogtooth tuna. However, it was not that the tuna weighed in at a whopping 40 kilograms that drew the keen anglers' attention, but the fact that the fish had a giant horn sticking straight out from its head. Kim Haskell's nephew Christopher reeled in a 40kg dogtooth tuna with a giant spike sticking out of it's head . Dubbed by social media users as a 'tunicorn', the bizarre sight of the horn stopped Kim and Jamie, both experienced fishermen, in their tracks. The Bloomfield resident said that he could see that something was different about the fish as they were reeling it in, but it wasn't until it was in the boat that he and his family could get a closer look. 'We got it up, and it had a spike sticking straight out,' Kim told Daily Mail Australia. 'We brought it on deck and carefully removed the bill in the dinghy and revived it.' Kim said that he was almost certain it was the elongated bill from a sailfish, similar to a swordfish or marlin, which had become embedded in the dogfish tuna's head. 'It looked to me like the only way it could have gotten there is that there was a feeding frenzy. My guess is there was a bait ball, and the sailfish must have speared the tuna by mistake, and the bill snapped off.' The trio extracted the bill, and released the tuna back in the water. As a result of where they were fishing, the bleeding tuna quickly attracted sharks and was killed soon after. 'We've been fishing all our lives, and it looked so strange,' said Kim. 'The area around the bill was well healed, which makes me think that it had been sticking out of the tuna's head for months or maybe years.' 'It's incredible that the bill missed major blood vessels and brain tissue and that the tuna was still able to operate.' Kim said that the area they were fishing in is an amazing piece of nature, and that he always feels lucky to head out to the reef. The area he and his family were fishing in is quite a remote area, approximately 100 kilometers past the Great Barrier Reef. 'You'd go all night, and because you're so far out you have to clip yourself on to the boat. If you fall off, it's unlikely you'll be found again because it's so remote.' 'I've seen some amazing things out there. Every time I've been there I'm reminded that it's one of the best places I've gone too,' said Kim. 'The water is so clear and everything is so big that you always feel incredibly lucky every second you're in the water.' 'The visibility is unbelievable, and you can see distance underwater.' Kim said that he still has the spike to remind him of the strange day. It's not the only odd thing he's seen out on the water though. A few weeks ago, he was out on the inner reef of the Osprey when he speared a coral trout. After climbing back into the dinghy he cut the trout to bleed it, and a small cod, about 10 centimeters, fell out of the fish's severed stomach. The cod was alive, and spewed out a 5cm bait fish which was dead. Kim put the cod over the side and it swam away. 'The trout must have just swallowed the cod just before I speared it,' said Kim. 'How lucky can you be?'","Experienced fisherman Kim Haskell, his brother Jamie and their nephew Christopher were on a family fishing trip in a remote part of the Osprey Reef in Queensland .

"The government's worst-case scenario forecast for the Ebola epidemic in West Africa won't happen, a U.S. health official said Wednesday. In September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated the number of people sickened by the Ebola virus could explode to as many as 1.4 million by mid-January without more help. Things have changed. On Wednesday, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said, 'We don't think the projections from over the summer will come to pass.' Sense of hope: The government's worst-case scenario forecast for the Ebola epidemic in West Africa won't happen, a U.S. health official said Wednesday . Frieden did not provide new estimates. He was speaking in Washington at a U.S. Senate hearing on preparedness and response to public health threats. The earlier projection was a worst-case scenario for reported and unreported illnesses in Liberia and Sierra Leone, based on conditions in late August - before an international surge in medical aid and supplies. That seems to have helped slow the epidemic in Liberia, one of the three hardest-hit countries. However, the epidemic has been fierce lately in Sierra Leone; it remains unpredictable in Guinea, . When he released the Ebola projections two months ago, Frieden said he was confident the most pessimistic numbers would not occur. Positive projection: On Wednesday, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden (pictured above) said, 'We don't think the projections from over the summer will come to pass' Since then, 'there has been very effective intervention with USAID, ourselves, the global community, and most importantly the countries and the communities most affected,' he said Wednesday. Since spring, there have been more than 14,000 Ebola cases and more than 5,100 deaths in the epidemic, according to World Health Organization figures. Frieden said the CDC thinks that now between 1,000 and 2,000 new cases are occurring in West Africa each week. That seems to be in the neighborhood of the CDC's best-case estimates for the epidemic by mid-January. Also on Wednesday, a Pentagon spokesman said the U.S. military is scaling back the size and number of Ebola treatment facilities it is building in Liberia from 17 to 10 centers.","In September, the CDC estimated the number of people sickened by  Ebola virus could hit 1.4 million by mid-January .

A spokesperson for the Denver Police Department told MailOnline Monday morning that Kitterman's disappearance remains an active missing persons case, but they do not have any leads and they do not suspect foul play at this time. Paul Kitterman was in the stands with his son during the first half of the Denver Broncos game against the San Diego Chargers Thursday night. Jarod left his 53-year-old father at halftime and didn't see him again after he arrived back at their bleacher seats. When the game ended and his father was nowhere to be seen, Jarod began to worry that he had disappeared. 9 News reported that Tia Bakke and her boyfriend had invited Paul and Jarod to see what would be their first Broncos game. 'Paul and Jarod had never been to a game so we got some extra tickets,' said Bakke, who drove down to Denver with the two from Kremmling, about two hours away. The father and son were seated in bleachers away from Bakke, but met up during the halftime intermission. When they separated again, Paul told Bakke he'd see her after the game. Father and son: Jarod Tonneson (left) and Paul went with Tia Bakke and her boyfriend for their first Broncos game on Thursday . Missing: A friend of Kitterman said that it was uncharacteristic of him to disappear and leave his son and family worrying about him . That was the last anyone has seen of him. His son Jarod was in the restroom during halftime and said that he returned to his seat but that his father never did. Paul's friends and his son scoured Mile High stadium after the game, speaking to staff and police, and phoned the area jails and hospitals without getting any clues as to what happened to Paul. According to Bakke, Paul is 'not a technology guy' and was carrying only $50 in cash, without any credit cards, cellphone or a car. Though a missing persons report has been filed, so far there has been no trace of Paul. 'He's absolutely nowhere to be found,' Bakke said. 'It's been the longest, [most] miserable three days of our lives.' There were no known medical problems or drug use in Paul's past that would lead him to disappear suddenly, said Bakke. Disappeared: Bakke described Kitterman as not being 'a technology guy,' possibly complicating the search for him as he disappeared without a cellphone or credit cards . 'This is just so not characteristic of Paul,' she said. 'Paul is one of the most loyal, responsible people you'll ever meet in your life. He would never, ever just leave you hanging, and especially his son. He would never leave Jarod.' Denver police told KDVR Sunday they did not suspect any foul play to be involved with Paul's disappearance. Tia Bakke's boyfriend, Jay Ust, said that nothing out of the ordinary happened before or during the first half of the game, and that Kitterman seemed in good spirits. 'Nothing adds up,' Ust added. The 53-year-old father was said to be 'totally out of his element' in the big city. Paul Kitterman is described as a white male, 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 190lbs, with brown hair and hazel eyes. He was last seen wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and a Broncos baseball cap. Anyone with information on Kitterman’s whereabouts is being asked to call Denver Police at 720-913-2000 .","Paul Kitterman, 53, was last seen by friends  at a game at Mile High stadium in Denver Thursday .

"Jail sentences of less than a year should be abolished unless there are exceptional circumstances, a Liberal Democrat justice minister declared last night. Simon Hughes said there should be a legal presumption that no one goes to jail for less than 12 months, with criminals given community or suspended sentences instead. But figures show such a move would mean 60,000 fewer criminals going to prison every year, including thousands of violent thugs, burglars, sex attackers and robbers. Simon Hughes (pictured) said there should be a legal presumption that no one goes to jail for less than 12 months, with criminals given community or suspended sentences instead . Over time it would lead to the halving of the current prison population of nearly 85,000, leaving tens of thousands of repeat criminals on the streets instead of behind bars. Campaigners against soft justice pointed out that most of those given short prison terms had already been ‘let off’ with several non-custodial sentences. Victims groups say short prison sentences are essential to give them some respite from those making their lives a misery. Mr Hughes set out his views in a speech to prison reform campaigners. He boasted in his speech about how his party had tamed the Conservatives in government by reducing the use of remand – ensuring more offenders are free on bail ahead of their trial. He also said Lib Dems had abolished the use of indeterminate prison sentences which allowed the most dangerous criminals to be locked up indefinitely because of the threat they posed to the public. And he said the Lib Dems had blocked Tory plans to double the maximum prison sentence which could be handed down in a magistrates’ court. Mr Hughes said: ‘I believe that it is time for a statutory presumption against custodial sentences of under 12 months. 'And, where a court decides that there is a justification for their use, they must have to set out the exceptional circumstances which warranted the sentence.’ Mr Hughes also challenged the Tory doctrine that ‘prison works’, first set out by then Tory Home Secretary Michael Howard (pictured) in 1993 . ‘Instead, we need alternative, more effective ways to punish those who break the law in the community.’ He added: ‘This is not about soft options.’ ‘Forcing someone to confront their behaviour – and, where appropriate, make amends to those directly affected by their offending – can be tougher than languishing in a prison cell for days on end.’ Mr Hughes also challenged the Tory doctrine that ‘prison works’, first set out by then Tory Home Secretary Michael Howard in 1993. Since then, the prison population has increased from about 44,000 in the early 1990s to some 85,000 now. Tories point out that in the same period crime levels in Britain have plummeted. An analysis of official sentencing figures carried out by the Mail shows what offences were committed by those who were jailed for less than a year over a five year period from 2009 to 2013. In 2013, some 59,322 offenders were given a jail term of less than 12 months. Over the five years from 2009 to 2013 that included a total of 2610 robbers, 8244 thieves, 12,572 violent thugs and 9252 burglars. It also included 1129 sex offenders convicted of assaults – the vast majority on women. Some 6566 thugs caught with a knife would also have escaped jail, as would some stalkers, kidnappers, and drug traffickers. A Conservative source said: ‘Going soft on crime isn’t the way to sort out re-offending. ‘Letting criminals get away with not going to prison seems to be the Lib Dems’ latest wheeze which we don’t for a moment think is what the vast majority of the public want to see.’ Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention think tank said: ‘It is incredibly rare for anyone to go to prison without first committing many, many serious offences. ‘Sending far fewer of these serious, repeat offenders to prison would be an extremely dangerous experiment with public safety.’ ‘The evidence is very clear. Short prison sentences have high re-offending rates, but so do people on community sentences and suspended sentences. ‘So the only sensible way to cut short prison sentences is to give criminals longer sentences. It’s once a criminal is in prison for two years or longer that we really see re-offending drop - and the public is completely protected in the mean time.’","Simon Hughes said sentences of less than a year should be abolished .

"Surrey is Britain's leafiest county according to the first ever complete tree count in England and Wales. Experts have carried out the exhaustive tree survey using the latest aerial mapping technology, showing there are 280 million trees in the UK. It revealed that the highest concentration of trees was not in rural areas but surprisingly in Greater London and Surrey. The first ever complete tree count in England and Wales has been carried out showing there are 280 million - with the most densely covered areas in Surrey. The new tree map shows dark green over London and surrounding areas, representing a densely tree populated area . The resulting map shows seven of the county's districts were in the top ten, with large swathes of dark green - representing a densely tree populated area - in London and the surrounding commuter belt. The new tree map shows large light patches where you'd expect to see trees in the countryside - and large dark green over London and surrounding areas. People behind the research says Surrey features so heavily because of the large gardens - where in more rural areas trees tend to be cut down for agricultural reasons. Rather than rural areas, its the residential estates and urban streets that are more heavily covered by trees, researchers found using photographs taken from planes. The Surrey Heath district of Surrey is 40 per cent covered, making it the most densely populated area. The resulting map shows seven of the county's districts were in the top ten, with large swathes of dark green - representing a densely tree populated area - surprisingly in London and the surrounding commuter belt . Bracknell Forest, in Berkshire, and New Forest, in Hampshire, are the only forests to feature in the top ten, according to the National Tree Map by Bluesky. The company's technical director, James Eddy, said: 'If you think about driving around Surrey, it's the big gardens and big houses with all the trees. 'It's strange - you'd think the big forests would be in the top ten. But the forests tend to be in more rural areas which are heavily farmed. 'They have taken out huge rows of trees and grown crops - that doesn't go on in Surrey. 'We were also quite surprised at London and how green it is - most people think cities are devoid of trees.' People behind the research says Surrey  features so heavily because of the large gardens - where in more rural areas trees tend to be cut down for agricultural reasons. Pictured is Box Hill, Surrey . Aerial view of Beaulieu, Hampshire one of the areas in the UK most densely covered in trees . Two heavily farmed Lincolnshire districts, Boston and South Holland, rank bottom with 2 per cent tree coverage and neighbouring Cambridgeshire districts Fenland and East Cambridgeshire are also in the bottom 10. Waverly, in Surrey, is shortly behind Surrey Heath and Neath Port Talbot, near Swansea, topped the Welsh chart with 32 per cent tree coverage. Bluesky's managing director Rachel Tidmarsh added: 'It's really interesting to be able to blow some preconceived ideas out of the window and dispel many popular misconceptions that surround the way we view the places where we work, live and play.' Researchers also found that England and Wales are covered by nearly 8,000 square miles of trees, an area large enough to cover Slovenia. The Leicestershire-based company also calculated the height of each tree using 3D imaging and will soon release date for Scotland. Bluesky hopes the data will be of use to a range of organisations including insurance companies and councils. 1. Surrey Heath (Surrey) 40.6pc . 2. Waverley (Surrey) 40.2 . 3.

"Gary Sims, 55, choked to death as he took part in the pickled egg eating contest at the Boar's Head Inn . A former Royal Marine  choked to death during a 'friendly' pickled egg eating contest in his local pub, an inquest heard. Father-of-two Gary Sims stopped breathing after stuffing three eggs into his mouth in a bid to win the challenge. The 55-year-old crashed off his chair and his eyes rolled back, prompting friends and staff to attempt the Heimlich manoeuvre, before ringing 999. Despite their best efforts Gary - known as Joe to his mates - suffered a cardiac arrest and died in the ambulance outside the Boar's Head Inn in Berkeley, Gloucestershire. The hearing heard the egg eating race was sparked after Mr Sims saw a friend buying an egg at the bar in June this year. He promptly bought six eggs, each costing around £1, and issued the challenge. Friend Alex Thackeray said: 'At 9pm a friend of his decided to buy pickled eggs, at which Gary issued a challenge, and more eggs were purchased. 'The two decided to have a race to see who could eat the quickest, with Gary putting all three in at once. 'He swallowed then took a swig with his pint to wash them down. 'I recall him trying to look at me directly before his eyes rolled in his head and he fell backwards. 'Initially it was believed he knocked himself out. Several of us picked him up and put him in the chair. 'It was very clear he was not breathing.' Gloucester Coroner's Court heard an ambulance was called immediately and a call handler issued advice over the phone. The friends tried to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre without success before attempting to unblock his airway with their fingers. They also performed CPR, which was then taken over by ambulance crew members. A second crew arrived, but further efforts to save him failed and was declared dead at 11.04pm. Fellow drinkers desperately tried to save Mr Sims by performing the Heimlich manoeuvre, before ringing 999. A post mortem examination found a 22mm-long piece of egg white lodged in his right airway. A blood test revealed at the time of his death he had 136 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood - the legal limit for driving is 80 milligrams. Mr Sims suffered a hypoxic injury due to shortage of oxygen to the brain, which led it to swell. Coroner Katy Skerrett concluded that his death was the result of an accident. She said: 'While drinking he entered a friendly competition or challenge with another drinker as to who could eat the pickled eggs the quickest. 'He started to choke and despite the efforts of his colleagues and paramedics, they could not save him.' Mr Sims, who lived in Berkeley, was also as a former contractor who had worked on the decommissioned power station at Berkeley for around five years.","Father-of-two Gary Sims was with friends in the Boar's Head Inn .

"An ex-soldier accused of murdering a Gold Coast nightclub singer said he had no choice but to kill the man in revenge for the rape of his girlfriend, a court has heard. Matthew Cox, 27, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Sex 'N' Chocolate singer Tony Williams in his Mermaid Waters unit on December 23, 2011. Crown Prosecutor David Meredith told the Brisbane Supreme Court that Cox tracked down Mr Williams and violently bashed him to death with a hammer, believing his girlfriend had once been raped by the singer and borne his child. Crooner: Tony Williams was an accomplished singer . Williams, born in New Zealand, was part of the band Sex 'N' Chocolate . The New Zealand-born victim's battered body was found on the floor of his lounge room the next day. The prosecutor said Cox's girlfriend, Sarah Davis, had a son believed to be Mr Williams' child who was the product of a casual sexual relationship with the singer and the hospital orderly. Some non-consensual sexual activity had once taken place, but Cox had been led to believe Mr Williams had raped Ms Davis in a one-off encounter that left her pregnant, Mr Meredith said. In early December 2011 Cox contacted friend and former soldier Joshua Middleton and allegedly said: 'I have something important and any man worth his weight would help me out on this one.' Mr Meredith said Cox wanted to make Mr Williams pay. 'I should put him in a wheelchair or kill him. What shall I do?' Cox allegedly asked Mr Middleton. 'Sex N Chocolate': The Gold Coast banned are pictured here, with Tony Williams at the centre . White suits: Tony Williams, right, was talented behind the microphone . When his friend asked if it had to be 'so drastic' Cox is said to have replied 'It has to be done'. Mr Meredith said Cox posed as a postman to gain entry to Mr Williams' unit before bashing him to death with a hammer, leaving blood smeared across the walls of the unit. Mr Middleton disposed of the evidence. The prosecutor said though Cox claimed he killed Mr Williams in self defence after confronting the singer over the alleged rape, there was evidence he'd taken gloves to Mr Williams' unit. 'If you were going to confront someone ... then you don't need to hide the fact that you're present,' Mr Meredith said. 'You don't need gloves. Gloves you might think hide the fact that you're there.' The trial is expected to run for up to 12 days.

"A married New Jersey police officer was arrested on Monday after being accused of exposing himself to young drivers during traffic stops and letting them go without a ticket. Jason Miller, 37, allegedly exposed himself during 'numerous' traffic stops to 'satisfy his prurient interests,' says an affidavit. After 'exposing himself' he is accused of letting drivers go without a ticket despite knowing that some of them had been drinking or that they had an expired registration. The Smoking Gun reports that Miller, who is a father of two, was freed in $35,000 bail. Charged: Jason Miller, 37, is accused of exposing himself to several young male drivers . The New Jersey Herald reports that Miller, who has been a police officer since 2001, turned himself in to the Sussex County Prosecutors office on Monday and is suspended indefinitely without pay. The affidavit details interactions with five men between the ages of 18 and 26 but police say that they have evidence of other, 'late night or early morning stops involving Officer Miller and young adult males…wherein it appears that Officer Miller’s pants were opened and/or his genitals were exposed and/or a zipper can be heard opening or closing.' One of the alleged encounters occurred between Miller and an 18-year-old man who is identified at J.A. J.A. told the Newton Police Department that he was stopped by Miller in September and that he observed something uncomfortable. J.A. says, 'he noticed the officer’s zipper was down and he saw what he believed to be the officer’s exposed genitals.' Both J.A.'s driver registration and insurance has expired but Miller allegedly let the teen go without impounding his car. The teen said that J.A's 'junk was hanging out'when telling the story to his girlfriend. A 23-year-old driver identified as K.K said that he and a male friend were stopped by Officer Miller. K.K. said that Miller asked him if he noticed the officer's 'zipper was down.' The driver said, 'no' and when the traffic stop was over K.K. dropped his friend off at home and continued driving. K.K. then realized that he was  being followed by Miller. Miller allegedly drove beside K.K., asked him to roll down his window, and repeated the question about whether or not the teen has seen him open his fly. K.K. then told the cop 'no,' once again. Miller is then accused of asking the man if the boy he was dropping off was his boyfriend. Suspended: Jason Miller has been suspended from the police department indefinitely without pay . 'K.K. told him no, and then told him that he has a girlfriend,' said the affidavit. Miller then supposedly, ‘told him to have a good night and left the area.' Police reviewed several videos of Miller's traffic stops. In one of the videos of a 2:39am traffic stop, Miller's 'pants are open and his genitals are exposed' while he speaks with a 26-year-old driver. The affidavit also states that Miller stopped a man in March who 'acknowledged he was coming from a bar and had consumed alcohol.' Instead of Miller issuing a summons, he walked back to his car and 'you can hear what appears to be the sound of a zipper opening and/or closing,' according to the affidavit.","Jason Miller, 37, allegedly exposed himself during 'numerous' traffic stops to 'satisfy his prurient interests'

"This is the moment a secret camera set up by his concerned mother and father captured a care worker hitting their disabled teenager on the back of the head and calling him stupid. Stanley Nkenka was caught abusing Zak Rowlands, 19, after his concerned parents set up the hidden camera in his bedroom in Oxen Barn Residential Home in Leyland, Lancashire, because he had started flinching when people came near him. And the fears of Paul and Julie Rowlands were confirmed when they watched the footage and saw their son being hit on the back of his head as he was put to bed before the teenager was left sobbing on his own in the darkness. Scroll down for video . Stanley Nkenka was captured on film hitting disabled Zak Rowlands, 19, at a residential home in Leyland, Lancashire, after Zak's parents set up a hidden camera because they feared the teenager was being abused . Nkenka has been jailed for six months after he pleaded guilty to ill treatment. In the video clip the 35-year-old is seen hitting the boy on the back of the head and flicking him as he tells him to go to bed. He then pushes the teenager on the bed and says 'it's time to sleep' and calls him a 'stupid boy.' As the youngster lays in darkness, Nkenka warns him 'Don't come out, or I will hit your head' before he swipes at him again. Nkenka is seen later approaching Zak and saying quietly: 'Do you want some more?' before he leaves him alone in his bedroom. Nkenka calls Zak stupid as he puts him to bed and then threatens to hit him if he gets out of his bed again . Zak Rowlands, 19, (left) who cannot speak and suffers with autism and severe learning difficulties, was hit round the head, threatened and then called a 'stupid boy' by carer Stanley Nkenka (right) on his birthday . At the end of the clip the teenager is heard sobbing on his own in the darkness. Mr Rowlands, a firefighter, told the Daily Mirror: 'Seeing that man do this to my son sent a chill down my spine. 'I felt guilt that I wasn't there for Zak when he needed me most.' Mr Rowlands said his wife, a police woman, had persuaded him to go through the police rather than confront Nkenka himself. The couple are now campaigning to have cameras installed in all care home bedrooms in a bid to stop patients being abused. 'Sadly we believe this treatment is rife in the care industry,' said Mr Rowlands. Nkenka is seen helping Zak on with his dressing gown before they go out of the bedroom at Oxen Barn . Nkenka brings Zak back to his bedroom after the teenager had apparently got up and told him to go to bed . As he puts Zak to bed Nkenka calls him stupid and repeatedly says 'down' to get him to move down in bed . The 35-year-old leaves the teenager in the darkness and threatens if he gets up again he will hit him again . He said he felt disabled patients needed property dignity and should therefore have cameras in their rooms to ensure they were not being mistreated. Oxen Barn - privately run by the Priory Group - is a specialist home for adults who have autistic spectrum disorders and severe learning difficulties. The Priory Group said it had a 'zero tolerance' policy towards abuse and Nkena was sacked immediately after his 'totally unacceptable' actions came to light. Nkenka, 36, from Bolton, pleaded guilty at Preston Crown Court last month to ill-treatment of a person without mental capacity in the early hours of May 12. At the hearing Judge Christopher Cornwall said: 'The ill-treatment that is complained of seems to me to be dismissive of him as an individual, unkind and uncaring, and really disrespectful of him as a human being. 'Carers must know that if they fall so far below the standards that are expected of them to the extent that they ill-treat the people they care for, they must know they put their liberty at jeopardy.' Zak Rowlands' father Paul (left) said Nkenka (right) has damaged the trust they have in the care of their son . When his parents noticed the  teenager was flinching, they set up a hidden camera at Oxen Barn care home . Mrs Rowlands previously told the court: 'When I saw the video recording of Nkenka hitting him, I felt sick, heartbroken, angry and incredibly guilty. 'It's hard to articulate the actual words that really describe my emotions. I'm scared, really scared that it will happen again.' She said she knew something was wrong when her son started to flinch when he was touched or approached. 'Sadly Zak, my loving, affectionate, special and incredibly vulnerable son hasn't the mental capacity to be able to speak but he communicates in his own way,' she told the court. 'By making sounds and by the sparkle in his eyes when he's happy and by the tears and the sorrow in his eyes when he's sad or hurt. But when that's not enough I am my son's voice and will always be until I take my last breath. Earlier this year, two care workers working for another Priory Group company in Bury were jailed for seven months after they were caught on a secret camera physically and verbally abusing a quadriplegic man.","Zak Rowlands, 19, cannot talk and suffers with severe learning difficulties .

"A New Jersey high school cheerleader who sued her parents for child support and tuition has agreed to dismiss her lawsuit. Rachel Canning, 18, appeared in court in Morristown on Tuesday and testified that she has decided to drop the complaint against her parents, Elizabeth and Sean Canning. Family Division Judge Peter Bogaard ruled that he found her decision to dismiss the litigation 'was a knowing and voluntary decision,' and he ordered the case dismissed, The Star-Ledger reported. Rachel moved out of her parents' home in Lincoln Park in late October after her parents refused to pay her bills if she refused to accept their house rules and break up with her boyfriend. Dismissed: Rachel Canning (pictured earlier this month), a New Jersey teenager who sued her parents for child support and tuition after she left home, has dropped the lawsuit . Starting afresh: She had sued Elizabeth and Sean Canning, pictured in court, after leaving home last year . In her lawsuit, Rachel had sought child support, private school and college tuition and payment of her legal bills. But last week, the teenager returned home with her tail between her legs after the judge took a dim view of her lawsuit, and she was pictured outside the home with her parents. Just hours after the teenager . returned home, Rachel's attorney had requested a court-appointed legal . guardian for the girl - which was promptly denied. Though . Canning went to court hoping to shame her parents into paying her child . support after kicking her out for failing to abide by their rules, she . was the one who took the brunt of criticism - both from her parent's . lawyers and the judge himself. 'Have . you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I . don’t see it in my house,' Family Division Judge Peter Bogaard said at a . hearing two weeks ago. Reunion: Mother and daughter were seen outside their house together last week after she returned home . Back to normal? The family was reunited a week ago after Mrs Canning called her daughter . He also warned he must consider the 'slippery slope' where 'we open the gates for a 12-year-old to sue for an Xbox, a 13-year-old to sue for an iPhone… what about a 15-year-old asking for a 60 inch TV?' Last week, the lawyer representing Rachel's parents held a . press conference confirming that the family had been reunited, but would not say what had sparked it. 'This is a long process, it's only the beginning,' Angelo Sarno said, according to the Daily Record. 'This . is a private matter. It should have never been brought to the court's . attention. It should have never been brought to the public.' He added: 'It's ancient history, it's done... This is a happy situation.' In shocking legal documents submitted . to the court throughout the process, the honor-roll student said her parents’ behavior . contributed to her developing an eating disorder at a young age and saw . her weight plummet.

A Department of Children and Families . investigation cleared Mr Canning of any claims of abuse, with Rachel's . parents claiming an official assigned to the case came to the conclusion . she was just 'spoiled'. Her parents had claimed their daughter ran off . to stay with friends when she turned 18 because she refused to abide by . rules they had set down, including to stop dating her boyfriend. The . judge clearly took a dim view of the lawsuit. He said: 'What kind of . parents would the Cannings be if they didn’t try to set down some strict . rules? Emotional: Both Sean and Elizabeth Canning began . crying in the courtroom earlier this month as their lawyers explained that they had to enforce their rules with their often . rebellious child . No cares: Rachel was seen . with her friend Jaime Inglesino, whose family took her in and paid her legal fees . 'I'm not going to put myself in anyone's shoes, he's (father Sean) trying to raise a child. It's clear to me all the positive qualities Rachel obviously has, in terms of sports and academics, but I’m not going to step on a father for how he tries to get his child on the right tracks when she has obviously come off the tracks, to put it mildly.' Through the hearings, it was revealed that she previously threatened to sue a teacher for kicking her out of the Homecoming dance because he thought she was drunk. Judge . Peter Bogaard also read an expletive-laden and vicious voice message left by . Rachel to her mother, in which she said: 'I wanna s*** all over your . face'.

"Bryan Barkley, who staged a solo protest against same sex marriage in March . A volunteer has been dismissed from the British Red Cross for protesting against gay marriage. Bryan Barkley, 71, was told he is no longer welcome at the charity because his views are incompatible with its values. The church-going pensioner received his dismissal letter after holding a one-man protest outside his local cathedral. He held up a placard saying ‘No same sex marriage’ and ‘No redefinition of marriage’. Yesterday his supporters said the charity’s action was shocking and it was punishing volunteers for their thoughts and views. Mr Barkley, who has worked for 20 years as a senior Red Cross volunteer, is appealing against his dismissal which he calls ‘unfair and without justification’. The grandfather, who has been married for 42 years, joined the organisation after taking early retirement from his job as a civil engineer and had recently represented it at a Buckingham Palace garden party. He said yesterday: ‘What have I done wrong? I passionately believe that the institution of marriage is between a man and a woman and is the cornerstone of our society. Why is it wrong to say so in public? ‘Freedom of expression is being stifled in this country. I have nothing against homosexuals. But I don’t believe Parliament was representing the views of the people when it changed the definition of marriage.’ Mr Barkley, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, worked for the charity’s international tracing service helping reunite families in Britain with relatives in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He staged his protest outside Wakefield Cathedral in March. It was reported in the local press and Pink News but his link to the Red Cross was not mentioned. However, in May he received a letter from Andy Peers, director of operations for the charity in Yorkshire, summoning him to a disciplinary hearing. The letter said it was to discuss his protest in relation to the ‘fundamental principles of the Red Cross, Red Crescent Movement and the values of the British Red Cross’. During the meeting, Mr Peers told Mr Barkley that the British Red Cross does not have a view on same sex marriage because as a charity it is impartial and neutral. Yet on August 8, Mr Barkley was told the charity was withdrawing his ‘opportunity to volunteer’ with immediate effect. The letter of dismissal accused him of breaching its principles. Coalition for Marriage, which co-ordinated opposition to gay marriage, is providing Mr Barkley with legal advice. Its director, Colin Hart, said: ‘This is a shocking case. Mr Barkley held the protest outside his local cathedral in Wakefield earlier this year . ‘For nearly two decades Bryan helped reunite people with lost family members. ‘Yet after voicing his opposition to the Government’s plans to rip up the traditional definition of marriage he was fired. ‘His only crime seems to be that he was one of millions of ordinary people who opposed this change. What will disturb most people is that the Red Cross says it is not his actions but his thoughts and views that were the problem. ‘Is it now official policy of the Red Cross that any volunteer who holds traditional views on marriage will face the sack?’ The Red Cross said: ‘We are committed to and bound by our fundamental principles which... do not take sides in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature. ‘We have to consider the compatibility of people’s publicly expressed views in line with the fundamental principles.’","Bryan Barkley held the one-man protest outside Wakefield Cathedral .

"Families were conned out of millions of pounds in life savings after handing over cash for luxury seaview apartments in UAE to a 'shyster developer'. At least 25 British buyers handed over up to £100,000 each to Iranian developer Frank Khoie, whose company was supposed to oversee the building of the properties. Khoie, who defaulted on the United Arab Emirates deal despite more than 700 international buyers paying deposits worth £50million, was jailed in 2009 after a £9.5million cheque to purchase land for the La Hoya development bounced. Among the British investors were Geoff Land, who lost £100,000, and pensioners Richard and Marilyn Chandlder, who lost £30,000 of savings that was meant for their retirement. Geoff Land (left) and his family had their dream of moving to a seaview apartment in UAE shattered by 'shyster developer' Frank Khoie (right) Retired couple Richard and Marilyn Chandler invested £30,000 in one of Khoie's apartments and planned to use it as a holiday home . Mr Land put down £100,000 on an apartment at the La Hoya development (artist's impression pictured) but it was never built . At least 25 Brits lost millions of pounds on the investment when Khoie was jailed after a £9.5million cheque to pay for the land bounced . Mr Land, from Birmingham, planned on moving to the idyllic La Hoya Bay Residences apartment on the man-made island of Al Marjan on the northern cost of UAE with his wife, Alika, and children. However after paying around £100,000 of their hard-earned money to Khoie, it became clear that the properties were not being built. They fought for their money to be returned after Khoie was jailed, but they are still waiting to be compensated by the developer - who was released from prison after just a year. Mr Land, an IT consultant, was forced to start working in Saudi Arabia for four years because of the failed property deal, flying in from UAE on Mondays and only seeing his family at weekends. He said: 'We have spent a lot of money trying to get this whole process sorted out. We realised it was not going to happen and we had to change track. We went to Saudi Arabia for four years, and had to re-save money. 'The flat has never been built. We were planning to stay there as a family. The development was supposed to be built on Al Marjan, a man-made island on the northern cost of UAE . Mr Land took legal action against Khoie Properties and is now waiting to be compensated. He was forced to work in Saudi Arabia for four years, hundreds of miles away from his family, to get by after the failed deal . 'It would have been a dream place in many ways, business was good, it is not far from Dubai, the lifestyle is super, it doesn't drop below 18 degrees in winter. 'It was on the coast with mountains behind it. It is a great place to bring up kids right by the beach. Home to work would have been a short walk across the Plaza. It was a dream which was shattered. Mr and Mrs Land moved to the Middle East in 2002 for work and, after having a child, decided to buy a home and settle down. The La Hoya Bay property promised a swimming pool, a beach, restaurants, shopping outlets and a safe environment for Mr Land's family. He paid £60,000 deposit and a further £35,000 in June 2008, but alarm bells started ringing when building work did not begin - just 15 months before construction was supposed to finish. After four years of legal battles and commuting to and from Saudi Arabia, the Lands moved back to the UK in 2012. At least 24 other British investors were left out of pocket, but they are finally set to be compensated over the next few months . 'I met Khoie several times. He was very gracious in the way he spoke to you, never aggressive. But the guy is just a shyster,' he claimed. A landmark legal victory by international legal services company Judicare Group cancelled sales agreements and ordered that deposits were repaid, but Mr Land, 55, says he still faces a wait for his money. He said: 'He has taken a lot of money from a lot of people, and he is still trying to do what he can to frustrate the legal system by stringing things out as long as he can. 'We have not got anything out of this yet, nothing is guaranteed. There is a mortgage on the land and it is protected until it is paid off. We are trying to unpick the legal process to get it sold off at auction. 'We do not know what the outcome is going to be, we hope that it turns out to be positive.' 'Looking back, Frank Khoie was selling a pyramid scheme. He has tainted the whole idyllic dream we once had of living in the UAE and we've had to completely change our life plans. 'The UAE legal system is expensive, arduous, slow and unresponsive and makes it so difficult for international investors. 'I would advise any property investor to steer clear of the country.' When Richard and Marilyn Chandler invested £30,000 in a luxury second-floor apartment at the La Hoya development in 2008, they thought they had set themselves up for a comfortable retirement. The pair, who are now in their late sixties, wanted a place in Middle East to be nearer to their son, who lives in Dubai, so they and other other family and friends could visit . But they, like the Lands, lost all of the money to Frank Khoie. The La Hoya Bay property promised a swimming pool, a beach, restaurants, shopping outlets and a safe environment for families . The pair, who are in their sixties, now live in Ramsgate, Kent - a far cry from their Middle East dream. Mr Chandler, who was a tiler before he retired, said: 'It was supposed to be nice and secluded with a great view - it would've been perfect. 'We were going to pop out and use it as an investment and later roll it over and pay for the rest of our retirement. 'We are gutted. Everything seemed so legitimate. For that amount of people to lose so much money, it's just unthinkable. 'Some have paid more than £100,000 and some bought more than one property. 'The £30,000 was there and now it's gone. We didn't stop talking about it for so long.' 'It's difficult to put into words. We're gutted this so-called gentleman has lost us £30,000.' Neil Heaney, chief executive of Judicare, said: 'Clearly the ruling is good news for our clients and is a warning to developers in the UAE who attempt to frustrate purchasers seeking reimbursement of invested monies for non-delivery of property, especially if they rely on an inaccurate Force Majeure argument.' Frank Khoie could not be traced for comment. Did you invest your hard-earned money in the La Hoya development, only for it not to be built?

"Film fans are being charged an extra £1 a ticket to see the latest blockbusters. The Odeon cinema chain has imposed the surcharge on Hollywood movies including Interstellar and the third in the Hunger Games series. It says the £1 extra is part of its ‘dynamic pricing’ policy. Scroll down for video . It costs £1 more to watch Hollywood blockbuster Interstellar (pictured) than British films at one of Odeon's cinemas because the chain has imposed a surcharge on popular Hollywood movies . But the move will infuriate filmgoers who feel that a trip to the cinema, from overpriced popcorn to the higher cost of peak-time screenings, is already a rip-off. At the Odeon in Richmond upon Thames, South West London, the adult price to see Interstellar, starring Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey, is £11.50, or £9.30 for a teen and £8.75 for a child. But they would all pay £1 less for popular British films such as The Imitation Game, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, or Mr Turner, starring Timothy Spall, at the same cinema. Similarly, the price for a family of four going to see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, starring Jennifer Lawrence, would be £35 in Richmond, £4 more than they would pay to see the British films. The Odeon’s policy appears to be driven by demand. Like other cinemas, it already charges much more to watch a film in some parts of the country, particularly the South, than in others. Like other cinemas, Odeon already charges more to watch a film in some parts of the country . For example, at the Odeon in Hull a family of four would pay only £18 to see Interstellar and The Hunger Games – around half what they would have to pay in Richmond. Industry blog Film Divider found the surcharge for blockbusters is applied in Odeons across the country. A member of staff at one cinema told the blog that it was necessary to ‘pay for the extra staff’ for a popular film. In a statement, the company said the surcharge was ‘so we can give our guests the very best experience and keep it that way’. It added: ‘We operate a dynamic pricing policy so that we can offer some excellent discounts during our quiet periods. ‘As Interstellar is a blockbuster film and has a high popularity rating, the premium price is applied. 'However this extra £1 will be dropped from the films after a few weeks of release.’ Zygi Kamasa, UK boss of Lionsgate – the studio behind the Hunger Games franchise – said it was right to charge more to see American blockbusters – which cost hundreds of millions to make – than for cheaper British movies. He told the Screen Daily website: ‘I think we should see UK films priced at £4 and US films at £10. A trip to the cinema isn’t cheap any more.’","Odeon cinema chain imposes £1 surcharge on popular Hollywood movies .

"Environment Agency chiefs spent £700,000 more on public relations than it would have cost to carry out dredging work that may have prevented flooding on the Somerset Levels, it has been revealed. The Government agency chose not to spend £1.7million on dredging stretches of the River Tone and the River Parrett before the recent flooding left much of the crisis-hit Somerset Levels underwater. However, bosses at the Environment Agency did spend at least £2.4million on PR activities. Costly: The Environment Agency spent £2.4million on PR activities, but chose not to spend £1.7million on dredging stretches of the River Tone and the River Parrett before the recent flooding left much of the crisis-hit Somerset Levels, including a number of villages, underwater . Surrounded: Many areas have been completely cut off by flood water, including the small community at Burrowbridge on the banks of the River Parrett . Underwater: Mark Kirby and his wife, Kate with their children, Dom, 16, Georgine, 14 and Theo, 10, inside their flooded home in Moorland . The figure, revealed in request under the Freedom of Information Act by The Sun, does not include the salaries of the agency's PR staff. 'It's disgraceful. They don't want to do the work until they absolutely have to,' Bryony Sadler from campaigners Flooding on the Levels Action Group told The Sun. There were repeated calls for dredging on the Somerset Levels made to government departments by farmers and others in the region at least six months ago. However, funding was declined. Many families have been forced to leave their homes with villages including Moorland, Currymore, Muchelney, Thorney, Burrowbridge and Westonzoyland all flooded or cut off and surrounded by water. According to Prime Minister David Cameron, who visited the region last week, the area has not been dredged since the late 1990s, and this had made it more prone to flooding. Waist deep: Kate Kirby outside her home in Moorland, Somerset, as she saves a few possessions from the rising water . Desperate: Dave and Sue Donaldson with daughter Heather at their flooded home in Burrowbridge . He blamed the last Labour government for the pause in dredging, a process which removes silt from river channels, and said that as soon as the flood waters subsided the area should be dredged. Last week Environment Agency chairman Chris Smith said that just £400,000 had been set aside for dredging, and that this had not been enough. The quango was instead waiting for other agencies to put forward money to enable dredging to begin. Fourteen Environment Agency executives take home salaries of more than £100,000 a year. The Environment Agency . has said that an increased amount of dredging would not have stopped the current flooding in Somerset, due to the unprecedented amount of water. Crisis: Many people living in Burrowbridge have been evacuated from their homes as water levels have risen . It said that it had spent £45m in the last financial year on improving river flow . across England, including clearing weeds and dredging. The Environment Agency has defended the money spent on PR and said: 'Money sepnt on communications is within strict government guidelines.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who has now been put in charge of handling the flooding crisis by David Cameron, said Lord Smith should make a public apology for the Environment Agency's mistakes. And asked whether the former Cabinet Minister, should resign, Mr Pickles said bluntly: ‘He has to make his own decision.’ ‘We made a mistake, there's no doubt about that and we perhaps relied too much on the Environment Agency's advice,’ Mr Pickles told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show. Visit: According to Prime Minister David Cameron, who visited the region last week, the area has not been dredged since the late 1990s, and this had made it more prone to flooding . ‘We recognise that we should have dredged and I think it is important now that we get on the process of getting those people back into their houses once we are able to really do some serious pumping.’ Mr Pickles has criticised under-fire Agency chairman Lord Smith for refusing to say sorry for the failures when he was besieged by angry locals on visit to the area. Asked if Prime Minister David Cameron should also apologise, Mr Pickles said: ‘I'll apologise. I'll apologise unreservedly. ‘I am really sorry that we took the advice ... we thought we were dealing with experts.’ The Agency was ‘fit for purpose’ and its staff were doing a fantastic job on the ground dealing with the floods but there were serious questions about parts of its leadership, he said. Abandoned: The flood-hit village of Moorland . Hitting back at ministers in the growing row over the handling of devastating winter storms Lord Smith insisted his staff knew 'a hundred times' more than any politician. He also squarely blamed Treasury funding rules for failure to dredge rivers, and again insisted he had no intention of resigning. Lord Smith said he had 'kept his counsel' up until now over Government funding and rules. 'When I hear someone criticising the expertise and professionalism of my staff in the Environment Agency who know more about flood risk management - 100 times more about flood risk management - than any politician ever does, I am not, I'm afraid, going to sit idly by,' he said. 'The EA is bound by the rules that are laid down by the Government. So when someone says that we followed the advice of the EA, what they were actually doing is following the Treasury rules that say how much we can spend and how much we cannot spend on any individual flood defence scheme.' The former Labour Cabinet minister said the Environment Agency was previously permitted to allocate only £400,000 to Somerset, and no other funding came forward. Damning: Asked whether Environment Agency chairman Chris Smith (right), should resign, Eric Pickles (left) said bluntly: ‘He has to make his own decision' Funds: Lord Smith said the Environment Agency was previously permitted to allocate only £400,000 to Somerset, and no other funding came forward . 'The situation now has completely changed because not only has the Government come up with some extra money for Somerset, but they have said the Treasury rules won't apply to Somerset.' He added that 'money absolutely is a big part of the issue'. Lord Smith was asked about reports that Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who was leading the Government flooding response before being forced to undergo an eye operation, complained to Downing Street about Mr Pickles' criticism of the EA. 'I have indeed spoken with Owen Paterson by text... he has been hugely supportive throughout of the Environment Agency, its staff and its work and I very much appreciate that.'","Government agency chose not to spend £1.7m on dredging stretches of the River Tone and the River Parrett before recent floods .

"A young German tourist has died in a hospital in Maui, Hawaii, one week after she lost her right arm in a horrific shark attack. Lana Lutteropp, 20, had been on life support and in 'very critical condition' at Maui Memorial Medical Center since she was pulled from the water last Wednesday by a heroic teacher who heard her screams. 'Jana fought hard to stay alive. However, we are sad to say that she lost her fight today,' her family said in a statement on Wednesday. Lutteropp was snorkeling 100 yards off Palauea Beach in Makena when a shark attacked and bit off her arm. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Globetrotter: German citizen Jana Lutteropp, 20, is on life support after losing her arm in a shark attack while vacationing in Hawaii . 'Jana was a very beautiful, strong, young woman who was always laughing, and we will forever remember her that way,' her family said. California high school teacher Rick Moore, who jumped into the water to save Lutteropp, said the young tourist kept repeating that she was going to die. ‘As soon as we stand on the beach, we heard this blood-curdling scream,’  the 57-year-old of Laguna Niguel, California, said. ‘We look out and there was blood everywhere in the white water around her.’ With the bikini-clad woman's other arm around his neck, Moore backstroked about 100 yards through strong ocean currents. ‘It . dawned on me - I was in danger now,’ he said. ‘The shark is around me . and she's bleeding. I start praying out loud, “God, God protect us.” She . said, “I'm dying. I know I'm going to die.""’ ‘About 10 feet from her, I saw her floating on her back, with no arm,’ Moore said. ‘It was completely severed from her body.’ Lutteropp is originally from Zierenberg north of Kassel in western Germany. She was a member of the town's carnival troupe called Grace Berger Dance Guard and had left Germany last summer to work as an au pair in Seattle, Washington. She was in Hawaii for a three-week vacation and was planning to return to Germany September 11, according to her personal blog as well as the HNA.de website that serves the region where her town is located. On her blog, Lutteropp wrote about her experiences working as an au pair for an American family living in Issaquah – a suburb of Seattle. Hero: Rick Moore (left), a 57-year-old gym teacher from California, jumped in the water after hearing Jana (right) screaming and brought her ashore, where he performed CPR until help arrived . The 20-year-old had spent a year caring for her host family’s three boys – 4-year-old twins and their 5-year-old brother. Her last day on the job was August 12, after which the young au pair apparently headed to Hawaii for a vacation. After Moore got Lutteroppto shore, his friend, Nicholas Grisaffi, 61, of Laguna Beach, stood in neck-high water and took the woman from Moore and carried her limp body out of the water. ‘What was left of her shoulder was in my chest,’ said Grisaffi, who teaches homeless fourth- and fifth-graders. ‘I had a pure-white rash guard on’ but there was very little blood on it, an indication of how much blood she lost. The two teachers said they put the woman in a bystander's kayak, using it as a stretcher to bring her up a trail leading to the street. The woman's three friends were in shock as Moore performed CPR. Attack: The victim is understood to have lost an arm after being bitten by the shark in Hawaii . ‘Pretty much everybody was out of . control except me and Rick,’ Grisaffi said. ‘If we're not there, she's . not saved. Nobody did a thing. They just stood there in shock, watching . the blood and everything.’ A . police officer arrived with a tourniquet as the woman was going in and . out of consciousness, Grisaffi said. An ambulance rushed her to Maui . Memorial Medical Center. Joshua Craddock, a 23-year-old from London who was sunbathing on the beach at the time, called 911. He hailed Moore's bravery. ‘He . was pretty heroic and selfless to dive in the water when by this stage . she was surrounded by a pool of blood which we could see form the . shore,’ Craddock said. Moore . and Grisaffi have visited the woman in the hospital and said she was in . stable condition Friday. Authorities have declined to release her name. ‘I just can't get the screaming out of my head,’ Grisaffi said. ‘The arm didn't bother me. At our age, we've seen a lot.’ The ordeal has changed his perspective on the ocean. ‘I won't take risks of going too far out any more,’ he said. Hawaii officials say shark attacks are unusual considering how many people are in the state's waters. Stunning: The young German tourist was snorkelling just 50 yards from Makena beach, Hawaii, when she was attacked . There . have been six shark attacks this year through the end of July, . including three on Maui, according to a state database. There were 11 . shark attacks in the state in 2012. The last time anyone in Hawaii died from a shark attack was in 2004. To . reduce the risk of being injured by a shark attack, state officials . urge people to swim in groups and avoid going in the ocean at dawn and . dusk, when sharks may come closer to shore to feed. But Craddock said he . doubts many people are aware of these warnings. ‘She was a young, fair-haired blond girl on vacation and she clearly had no idea,’ he said.","Shark attack victim Jana Lutteropp, 20, was on life support .

"Jayne Copley put on her old nurse uniform and pretended she was on duty to get hold of Tramadol . A former nurse wore her old uniform and carried her ID card to trick hospital staff into handing over strong painkiller Tramadol. Jayne Copley, 34, pretended to be on duty by putting on her old uniform at Hull Royal Infirmary and duped staff into giving her packets of the drug, claiming they were for patients. The mother-of-one brazenly walked into two hospital wards, asked for the narcotic-like drugs - which can be highly addictive - and explained they were for a patient in another ward. But another nurse on duty raised the alarm after she became suspicious and Copley, from Hull in East Yorkshire, was arrested the same day. She admitted two charges of fraud by false representation yesterday at Hull Magistrates' Court. Prosecutor James Byatt said there had been an element of 'pre-planning' by Copley before she went into Wards 4 and 40 on June 9, this year, to obtain the drugs. 'This lady used to be a nurse and she kept her nurse's uniform and identification badge,' he said. 'She was going into Hull Royal Infirmary to one ward saying, ""Can I have some Tramadol tablets"", claiming they were needed by staff for a patient in Ward 6. 'She wasn't working at the hospital and the ward didn't need the tablets - they were for her. 'She then went into another ward and did the same thing.' Copley, who has a two-year-old daughter, had told staff she was employed by private health service Bupa but was working at Hull Royal Infirmary as a temporary bank nurse - registered nurses who provide cover to NHS hospitals. When Copley was arrested she denied the offences and claimed staff had mistaken her for someone else. At an earlier hearing, Mr Byatt said: 'I understand Ms Copley is a registered nurse but at the time of these alleged offences she was not working for the NHS or a private company. 'She suggested to various people she was working for Bupa and had signed up on that day as a bank nurse on Ward 6. 'She went into two wards - Ward 4 and 40 - and requested from members of staff there, Tramadol, the painkilling drug. 'It was alleged the drugs were needed by staff for a patient on Ward 6. 'There was not a huge quantity of the drug and the staff say it was being used as a controlled drug to relax the patients.' Mr Byatt added that she had breached the trust of the other nurses when she made off with almost 70 tablets of the painkiller, which is used to treat moderate to severe pain. Copley walked into Hull Royal Infirmary (pictured) and asked staff on two wards for the powerful drugs, claiming they were for a patient in another ward. She pocketed the 70 pills for herself and was later arrested . She was caught when another nurse became wary and informed management, who investigated and called the police. In mitigation for Copley, Michael Miller described the case as 'unusual' but asked for it to be adjourned for pre-sentence reports. He said: 'It is clearly unusual circumstances and they don't fit neatly into the sentencing guidelines. 'She has no previous convictions and has a two-year-old daughter. 'Clearly there are issues as to the background of this. 'Obviously these drugs were for her own use. I ask for the preparation of a pre-sentence report.' Russell Moore, the head of security at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, praised staff for raising the alarm quickly. He said: 'Fraud committed against the NHS takes vital funds away from our hospitals and the patients we serve.

"If it seems you are permanently single while everyone around you is in a relationship, blame your DNA. Scientists have identified a 'singleton gene'. Those who have it are 20 per cent more likely to be single than others. It is thought that by lowering levels of the feel-good brain chemical serotonin, the gene makes people less comfortable in close relationships. This could make it harder to form them in the first place – or lead to break-up after break-up. Scientists have identified a 'singleton gene', so if you find yourself often without a significant other, like Bridget Jones, played by Renée Zellweger (pictured), blame your DNA . The scientists tested hair samples from almost 600 Chinese university students to analyse a gene called 5-HTA1 which comes in two different versions. Those with the 'G' version were much more likely to be single than those with the 'C' version. Some 60 per cent were not in a relationship – compared to 50 per cent of those in the 'C' group. Importantly, the link couldn't be explained away other factors that influence relationships, including appearance and wealth. It is thought that by lowering levels of the feel-good brain chemical serotonin, the gene makes people less comfortable in close relationships . The key to the finding seems to be the role of the 5-HTA1 gene in the brain. Those with the 'G', or singleton, version, make less of serotonin, a brain chemical involved in mood and happiness. It was already known that people with the 'G' allele, or version, find it more difficult to get close to others. Plus, they are more likely to be neurotic and to suffer from depression. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers said: 'As pessimism and neuroticism are detrimental to the formation, quality and stability of relationships, this connection between the G allele and psychological disorders might decrease carriers' dating opportunities or lead to romantic relationship failure.' The Peking University researchers said that students may have more free time and freedom to form relationships that others. And at other times of life, other factors, such as pressure from parents to marry, may be much more influential. Despite this, they concluded that their study provides 'evidence for genetic contribution to social relationships in certain contexts'. Other scientists said that while genes will inevitably influence relationships, their role in most cases will be small. Dr Pam Spurr, a relationship expert, said that we don't have to let our genes rule our lives. She said: 'I know that our genetic heritage determines some of our behaviour but we always have choice. 'If someone's difficulties with dating are flagged up to them, I believe they can learn to interact in a way that will make them more successful in meeting somebody. 'I feel quite optimistic about that.'","Scientists have identified a 'singleton gene' which lowers level of serotonin .

"These stunning pictures show a 100-mile (160km) long cloud that looks just like bubble wrap blanketing the sky. Hundreds of round 'balls' of cloud are seen hanging at sunset, during a storm in the US. The spectacular bubbly clouds are officially known as mammatus and are extremely rare because they can only be seen when they are low in the sky and lit up by sunlight. Storm chaser Mike Hollingshead from Nebraska has captured incredible photos of 'bubble clouds' in the sky (shown). Known as mammatus clouds the amazing structures form behind storms. While most clouds have wispy edges, mammatus lobes, which are usually stable for only a few minutes, have unusually sharp and well-defined boundaries. Each lobe can be up to a mile (1.6km) in diameter . The extraordinary bubble wrap clouds were taken by storm chaser Mike Hollingshead who lives in Nebraska. The 38-year-old was out chasing storms when he decided to try his luck at seeing the mammatus clouds. Mammatus are bulbous formations that are found under other clouds. While most clouds have flat bottoms, mammatus have round pouches that are caused by sinking air. This has led to cloud physicists referring to the shape as being caused by negative buoyancy. Their name is said to be derived from the Latin for breast. The clouds, which often form in turbulent air, can stretch for hundreds of miles and can be a sign of a gathering storm. For the clouds to form, there must be a sharp change in temperature. He said: 'They're amazing, especially when they are highly pronounced like these. 'They look even more amazing when there is good sunset light on them, it makes the colours look better.' The clouds, which are formed after a sharp change in temperature or moisture, can sometimes be a sign of an approaching thunderstorm or, in some cases, a tornado. 'Turbulence within a cumulonimbus cloud may cause these clouds to form, especially on the underside of the projecting anvil,' the UK Met Office told MailOnline. A cumulonimbus cloud is a dense towering vertical cloud associated with thunderstorms. The agency explained that the bumpy, multi-lobed features are most prominent when the sun is low in the sky. Often, streaks of precipitation that don't reach the ground, known as virga, can be seen within the mammatus clouds. While they are most common in large continents such as the US, they are very occasionally seen in the UK as well during severe thunderstorms. The name is derived from the Latin for breast. Mammatus clouds are associated with powerful storms that can occur in the summer, and are a sign of the massive quantities of water vapour that are held in the languid summer air. While most clouds have wispy edges, mammatus lobes, which are usually stable for only a few minutes, have unusually sharp and well-defined boundaries. Each lobe can be up to a mile (1.6km) in diameter. They take the appearance of hundreds of little balls caused by turbulence within a cumulonimbus cloud.

While they are most common in large continents such as the US, they are very occasionally seen in the UK as well during severe thunderstorms . Mr Hollingshead continued: 'Sometimes when there is a storm I get much more motivated to go to the back of it to see the mammatus clouds. 'They're really incredible to see, the lighting was so nice too because it was at sunset. Here in the plains of the US you could probably see one a year. 'They usually will stay like that for hours. The problem is often you can't see them until the sun dips further out west. 'When looking for them you have to wait until the sun gets below a certain point. 'You can see them after sunset through twilight into dark. Some of the coolest scenes are just city lit ones at night. But it's so hard to get really clear skies behind storms to really view them.' 'They're amazing, especially when they are highly pronounced like these,' said Mr Hollingshead.

"The family of a film worker who was killed in a train accident while shooting a movie near Savannah has reached a settlement with several defendants in a civil suit. A statement from the Harris Penn Lowry law firm Wednesday said the settlement in a suit filed by the family of 27-year-old camera assistant Sarah Jones includes Unclaimed Freight Productions, Inc., Rayonier Fibers, LLC, and several others. Jones was killed the first day of filming for a movie on musician Gregg Allman in February and attorneys say the terms of the settlement are confidential. Settlement: The family of a film worker who was killed in a train accident while shooting a movie near Savannah has reached a settlement with several defendants in a civil suit . Confidential: A statement from the Harris Penn Lowry law firm Wednesday said the settlement with Unclaimed Freight Productions, Inc., Rayonier Fibers, LLC, and several others will remain confidential . The statement says CSX railroad and Meddin Studios are still listed as defendants. Her death sparked a renewed discussion about precautions on film sets, as Jones' father, Richard Jones, says his family is continuing to advocate for safety on film sets through the Sarah Jones Film Foundation. Hairstylist Joyce Gilliard, who suffered an arm injury in the crash, said those involved in the shoot had been told that if a train comes, 'you have 60 seconds to get off the track'. Referring to Miss Jones's death on February 20, she added: 'At first it was like a quiet, like people were in shock at what happened. I remember hearing somebody say ""Oh my gosh, she's dead"".' After carrying out a number of inquiries, investigators determined the filmmakers went onto the railroad bridge to shoot the footage after CSX Transportation denied them permission. A letter to location manager Charley Baxter seemingly confirms officials' findings, reading: 'Unfortunately CSX is not able to support your request.' Meanwhile, director Randall Miller is reportedly said 'that's not my job' when asked questions on why he didn't know that there could be a train barreling down on his crew. The Jones's attorney, Jeff Harris, said: 'You don't shoot on a railroad track unless you have permission to be there.' Miss Gilliard, who is also suing Miller and others involved in the shooting added: 'They wanted to get the shot, so whatever it took to get the shot is what they did. Officials say filmmakers went onto the railroad bridge without permission . Miller and others accused of involuntary manslaughter . 'The entire crew was put in a situation where we all had to basically run for our lives.' On Thursday, Mr Harris said the Joneses have decided to dismiss all claims against Allman - an executive producer of the film based on his life story - after reviewing evidence in the case. 'It is clear that Mr. Allman ... had no involvement in any of the decisions that resulted in Sarah's death,' he said in a statement. Allman - who was dismissed alongside two others - was among 10 individuals and eight corporations named as defendants in May when the Joneses filed their lawsuit in Savannah. The couple is still seeking damages from others, including Miller, railroad firm CSX Transportation and Rayonier Performance Fibers, which owns the property surrounding the crash site. Miller and three other filmmakers have also been indicted on criminal charges of involuntary manslaughter, a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and trespassing in rural Wayne County where the crash occurred. Allman's attorney, David Long-Daniels, said the singer had little involvement with the movie other than licensing the rights to his memoir, 'My Cross to Bear', to the filmmakers. 'We're delighted the Jones family has dismissed us,' Long-Daniels said. 'We remain very sorrowful for the tragedy they have endured with the loss of their daughter.' The Jones family's attorneys said they also dropped claims against Michael Lehman, an executive producer on the film, and Open Road Films, a film distribution and marketing company. During the 20/20 report, photos of Miss Jones's final hours as a camera assistant were also unveiled, including one of her working beside Hurt, who was lying on the bed on the train tracks. The bed was being used in a dream sequence that involved Allman lying down and seeing his late brother across the bridge, according to The Hollywood Reporter. It also aired a 911 call from the set following the fatal train crash, in which someone is heard requesting an ambulance, saying 'someone got hit by a train'. During her career, Miss Jones also worked on the set of The Vampire Diaries, where she was described as a 'cosmic sister' by actor Ian Somerhalder. The attorney's comments followed an earlier prepared statement from Miller and Savin in which they said the crash and Miss Jones's death 'will haunt us forever' Miller and producer Jody Savin's attorney told ABC that the filmmakers believed they had permission to be on the tracks from Rayonier. They added: 'They had no reason to believe that anyone would be placed in danger. They will live with the sorrow of Sarah's death for the rest of their lives.' The attorney's comments followed an earlier prepared statement from Miller and Savin in which they said the crash and Miss Jones's death 'will haunt us forever'.. A railroad safety expert also pointed out that the crew had no way of knowing when a freight train might speed down the track because there is no train schedule 'like a major airline might publish'.","Sarah Jones was killed the first day of filming for a movie on musician Gregg Allman in February .

"The British arm of an elite American fraternity - which counts presidents including Bush and Ford among its Alumni - is being probed over claims members made jokes about rape at a meeting. As reported in The Student, brothers of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Edinburgh University allegedly made jibes about raping members of the feminist society, including going for a 'raping trip'. According to minutes from the meeting, members of the frat - known as Deke - suggested a 'phone a Deke' service to escort drunk women home from campus, and allegedly made offensive comments about transgender people. The Edinburgh University chapter of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity is under investigation amid allegations that members joked about raping members of the feminist society (pictured, the DKE emblem) The Edinburgh branch of Delta Kappa Epsilon is the only UK branch of the historic American fraternity which was founded at Yale in 1844. The scandal, which could see the branch closed down, comes less than a week after they were officially recognised as a chapter of the DKA fraternity. The offensive comments were reportedly made by the all-male group during the discussion of an agenda item labelled 'Feminists'. One frat member suggested organising a game of paintball with the Feminist Society to 'calm the waters' after the group spoke out against a brnach of DKE being established. Another member vetoed the motion, prompting the proposer to ask: 'How are we going to rape them?' before a second member added: 'Let’s go to Montenegro, for a raping trip.' A member of the fraternity also joked that a female EUSA official had raped his friend in Florida, before another member responded: 'She didn’t need a strap-on!' Among the Alumni of the elite fraternity are Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and George W. Bush, along with Sidney Souers, the first director of the CIA, and Briton Hadden, who co-founded Time Magazine . Delta Kappa Epsilon claims to have 44,000 'brothers' in 54 active chapters across North America and five former US Presidents are members. Vice President Societies & Activities at EUSA, Eve Livingston said: 'We were alerted to the existence of minutes from a ""Delta Kappa Epsilon"" fraternity meeting which detailed discussions of rape threats, transphobia and other unacceptable content. Founded in 1844 by fifteen students at Yale, Delta Kappa Epsilon was designed to give members companionship, allies in college politics, and help with studies. Members had to prove that they were a 'gentleman' to be considered for entry, with the ideal candidate combining 'in the most equal proportions the gentleman, the scholar, and the jolly good-fellow.' The frat, along with its identity pin and secret handshake, established itself on campuses around America, and now has 44,000 members in 54 chapters. Among its most famous Alumni are Presidents Bush junior and senior, Theodore Roosevelt, Rutherford Hayes, and Gerald Ford. Sidney Souers, the first director of the CIA, Briton Hadden, co-founder of Time Magazine, and Charles Alton Ellis, who designed the Golden Gate Bridge, were also members. In recent time the frat has courted controversy, with the Yale chapter suspended after members were recorded marching across campus chanting pro-rape slogans. 'Kappa Delta Epsilon have no affiliation with EUSA. 'We as an organisation, alongside NUS Scotland, have publicly condemned them in the past, commenting on the dangerous and misogynistic nature of fraternities which have no place in our student community. 'We are shocked and appalled by the contents of the leaked minutes and our priority is absolutely the welfare and safety of our students. 'As of this morning I have raised the issue with the University Secretary as a breach of the Code of Student Conduct and a potential criminal offence, and I await an official response from the University. 'Students have my assurance that finding and disciplining those responsible for these unacceptable comments and threats will remain a top priority until this is resolved.' A message on the Edinburgh University Feminist Society Facebook page said: 'FemSoc condemns in the strongest terms the abhorrent misogynistic and transphobic behaviour and statements made by the DKE frat. 'We hope the university will join us in standing up against sexism and take disciplinary action against students involved in the frat. 'We plan to take further action on this issue to make sure the Frat cannot continue to operate on this campus.' The Yale branch of the fraternity is also currently suspended after members were recorded walking across campus chanting 'no means yes' in 2011.","Minutes of Delta Kappa Epsilon meeting 'show members joking about rape'

"A student who took her life just hours before a classmate also killed herself was devastated over a leg injury that would keep her from joining the Navy, her stepdad has revealed. Ciara Webb, 16, shot herself dead in her home in Olathe, Kansas on November 7 - just two days before her friend and soccer teammate Cady Housh, 16, stepped in front of a freight train. Now, as the small town struggles to deal with unimaginable tragedy, Webb's stepfather has revealed that his daughter had asked to stay home from a trip to a shooting range - and took her life instead. Mike Gage told People magazine that his daughter had stayed home from school, which was not unusual because she had undergone five surgeries since a leg injury two years before. Loss: Ciara Webb, 16, shot herself dead last month, just two days before a classmate took her life. Her step-father revealed she had long struggled with a leg injury and had to drop out of the soccer team . Tragic: Two days after Ciara died, her classmate, 16-year-old Cady Housh, pictured, also took her life . She often attended doctors appointments and sometimes her parents allowed her to stay home when she was in pain because she was a good student, Gage said. The injury meant that she had dropped out of the soccer team in September and it also seemed unlikely that she would be able to join the Naval Academy, where she dreamed of training as a diver. On her day off, they had multiple activities planned - a meal at a steak restaurant, a trip to the shooting range and then a film - but instead she asked to stay home and watch TV. Gage said they had noticed she had been quieter in recent weeks and happier to spend time alone. When they spoke to her about it, she said she just wanted to get on with her life and go to college. Missed: Webb's stepfather Mike Gage, pictured together, said they were supposed to go to a shooting range on the day she took her life, but instead she asked if she could stay home and watch television . But when the family left her alone in the house that day, she took her life. The school was notified and students, including Cady Housh, were shaken by the news. Friends said she seemed upset at soccer practice, but pointed out that they were all devastated. On Sunday, she posted a message to Twitter reading: 'Worst weekend of my f***ing life.' That evening, she stepped in front of a train in Lenexa. The driver saw her and called authorities but was unable to stop the train, and she was killed. Authorities have said that they do not believe there is a connection between the two deaths, but friends say they think otherwise. 'She said if she had reached out to [Ciara] more, then it wouldn't have happened,' friend Abby Conner told People. 'She wasn't thinking rationally. She said, ""I wish I could have done something"".' Heartbreaking: Cady posted this message to Twitter just hours before she stepped in front of a train . Remembered: Hundreds gathered at a candlelit vigil for the teenagers days after they took their lives . The school and small town are now trying to deal with the tragedies. 'You dreaded going into the hallways,' ONW high student Katie MacDonald told the Kansas City Star. 'Class was fine, because I'm a freshman. But when you went into the hallways, that's when people that knew (the first victim) were there.' Friends told People that people continue to cry in the lunchroom. The girls were remembered at a candlelit vigil days after the double tragedy. One of their fathers told the crowd to share their feelings with one another to prevent anything similar from happening ever again because he never would have predicted his daughter would take her life.

"It's been nearly two months since their 19-year-old son was found dead after an early-morning fraternity activity, and Gary and Cindy Hipps still don't have any answers explaining his mysterious and untimely death. The  body of Clemson University freshman Tucker Hipps was found submerged in the Seneca River at the end of September, hours after his brothers at the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity reported him missing. It's believed the pledge class president fell off a 20ft bridge into the water. Hipps was last seen on a pre-dawn run with his brothers on September 22 where he started to fall behind, but was allegedly first noticed missing when he didn't show up for breakfast that morning. His parents are now speaking out, believing someone knows what happened to their only son that morning and is holding back. Scroll down for video . Cindy (left) and Gary Hipps (right) lost their only-son Tucker this past September. The 19-year-old Clemson University student's body was found submerged in Seneca Lake hours after participating in a fraternity activity . Tucker (pictured) was last seen on a pre-dawn run with his fraternity brothers the morning of September 22. Brothers say he started to fall behind, but that they didn't notice him missing until he failed to show up for breakfast . 'That's a horrible thing to hold inside, it's going to affect you for life,' Mrs Hipps told Fox Carolina. 'It's going to affect all of your relationships. It's going to affect your school, it will affect how you deal with things. It might not feel so bad right now, but as time goes on it gets worse and worse. Truth, the power of truth sets you free.' The incident is still under investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and Oconee County Sheriff's Office. They are not speaking about the case until their final report is published, with will include toxicology results. Tucker's death is even more tragic considering his parents warned him against joining a fraternity, preferring he spend his time in college focusing on his studies. But they relented since he was a social young man and students in Greek Life organization do, on average, maintain higher grade-point averages. Following Tucker's death, Clemson University suspended all Greek Life activities. It's unclear if that's suspension is still in place . Tucker apparently fell from this bridge into the waters of the Senca River. Police are still investigating the incident, and will not be commenting on the case until they release their full report, including toxicology reports . Mr and Mrs Hipps believe someone knows what happened to their son, and is holding the details back. They are now speaking out in hopes of inspiring that person or people to come forward. Pictured above, officers and campus police arriving at the scene where Tucker's body was found . 'I told him I'm not going to say you can't do it but I am not going to pay for it,' Mr Hipps told WSPA. Just four days before he died, Tucker's parents had dinner with him, and they saw that the pledging process noticeably taking a toll. 'I can tell you that last time I saw him he was both tired and worn out he looked like he hadn't had much sleep,' his dad said. 'It was hard and I asked him I said are you feeling okay are you doing alright?' Following Tucker's death, Clemson University suspended all Greek Life activities though they wouldn't say it was directly because of the incident. It's unclear if that suspension is ongoing. Calls to the university were not immediately returned Thursday morning. Mr Hipps (left) says he didn't want his son (right) to join a fraternity, but relented because he didn't want to deny  Tucker a place to be social. However, he did make his son get a job to pay for the fraternity fees himself . The Hipps also hope their son's death will help bring change to the fraternity pledging process. Tucker pictured above with an unidentified young woman on the left . 'There seems to be something systemically wrong with the pledging process, and how kids are put through the things they are put through,' Mr Hipps said, adding that he is not 'making any friends'  in the Greek community as he searches for answers in his son's death. Mr Hipps also expressed condolences to the family of Nolan Burch, a West Virginia University student who died last week after he was found unconscious at his fraternity house. 'When people begin to be injured and die then it's time to really take a hard look at processes that put our children in danger,' Mr Hipps added. Now the Hipps are faced with the prospect of spending Christmas without their only son for the first time. However, they plan to celebrate as they usually do, decorating the house and putting Tucker's special ornaments on the tree.","Tucker Hipps, 19, was found dead in a South Carolina lake in September after going missing on a pre-dawn run with his Sigma Phi Epsilon brothers .

"A father and son were killed when their light aircraft broke up in mid-air and fell from the sky 'like a stone', an inquest has heard. Roger Hayes, 75, from Holsworthy, Devon, and son Andy, 39, from Birmingham, died when their twin-seat plane crashed at Pierre-Buffiere, in central France, on June 29 2012. The plane crashed 20 minutes after taking off from nearby Limoges as they flew to the south of France. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. Roger Hayes, 75 (left) and his son Andy, 39 (right) were killed when their light aircraft crashed over France . Pilot Mr Hayes Jnr, a video producer, and his father, a farmer, had been heading to the southern town of Rodez in their white Jabiru 450. They hit restricted airspace, which they did not have permission to travel through, at around 4,000ft (1,219m) and Mr Hayes Jr attempted a 180-degree turn to leave it. The pair were in thick cloud at the time and may have suffered from spatial disorientation, causing Mr Hayes Jr to become unaware the aircraft was nosediving, the inquest heard. He attempted to pull sharply out of the manoeuvre but this led to a sudden shift in pressure in the light aircraft - causing first the left wing and then the right to break off in mid-air. Exeter and Greater Devon Coroner's Court heard the airspace could have been restricted due to military operations, or a number of other unspecified reasons. Dr Elizabeth Earland, Coroner for Exeter and Greater Devon, concluded both men died as a result of multiple injuries in 'accidental' deaths. She said: '(They) were in a light aircraft which left Limoges at around 12.06pm on June 29 2012 on its way to Rodez. 'At approximately 12.44pm the left wing separated from the fuselage and shortly after that the right wing as the aircraft was subjected to an increased load as it climbed at 4,500ft in an attempt to avoid a restricted area. 'There was low cloud and bad weather and the plane broke up and crashed into a water outlet in Pierre-Buffiere.' A Jabiru 450 like the plane which crashed as Mr Hayes Snr and his son flew to the south of France (stock) Dr Earland said an RAF Puma helicopter had been in the same airspace at a similar time but there was no collision with the aircraft. The two men had set off from Cherbourg before landing at Limoges to refuel, leaving at 12.06pm to head for Rodez. French air traffic controllers had warned Mr Hayes Jr, who had 56 hours 45 minutes of flying experience, of scattered cloud at 2,400ft (732m) at around 12.20pm. At 12.45pm, the controller heard a background noise on the frequency and tried to make contact but could not reach Mr Hayes or his father. Witnesses heard the sound of the aircraft's engine revving before seeing it circling out of control and the left wing flying off, followed by other pieces which fell to the ground. Jacques Keedah, who worked near the crash site, said: 'The left wing was falling into the air and the plane turning like a whirlpool. 'It fell like a stone. The plane came down directly to Earth in a spin. After it had hit the ground I heard the sound of a collision but no further explosion.' Elsewhere, school assistant Didier Paulet was called by pupils in the playground to reports of the plane falling from the sky. 'Looking up in the direction they showed me, I saw what I thought was a small white aircraft,' he said. 'The engine was racing as if it was jammed. The aircraft quickly started losing bits. Other bits, some bigger, started falling off. The rest of the plane fell in one piece almost immediately.' The inquest heard that data gathered from Mr Hayes' iPad, which had a navigation app running, showed the aircraft had attempted to turn round shortly before the nosedive. Adrian Cope, senior inspector at the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch, said the plane had entered restricted air space and could have been trying to leave it. 'The pilot may have realised he was in restricted air space and was trying get back out again,' he said. 'It was descending significantly and the aircraft speed would be increasing. The pilot realised he was descending and was trying to rectify that situation. 'If that was done quite abruptly that would have put strain on the wings.'","Roger Hayes, 75, and son Andy, 39, died when their light aircraft crashed .

Reeps One, whose real name is Harry Yeff, is famous for his unique ability to create bass music using his vocal chords. The artist believes the key to his success is moving away from the hip-hop style that is historically associated with beatboxers, and instead towards electronic music such as grime, dubstep and drum and bass. Scroll down for video . Reeps One, whose real name is Harry Yeff, is famous for his unique ability to create bass music using his vocal chords . 'The electronic influence as a whole completed defined the way I beatbox,' he said. 'When I started doing that publicly, started not thinking about other beatboxers, not even other musicians, but what resonates with me, it really affected the entire world community.' 'I'm so honoured when people tell me ""you're the reason I started beatboxing""'. After winning the UK Beatbox Championships twice in a row, Yeff moved on to touring the world, taking the place of DJs to perform high energy, hour long sets in night clubs using just his voice. Reeps One judging at the American Beatbox Championships last month in New York where he also performed . Reeps One has now recorded a documentary with Sofar Sounds, a revolutionary music organisation who set up secretive gigs in people's homes . 'I'm so honoured when people tell me ""you're the reason I started beatboxing'""he said . Last month he flew to New York to judge the American Beatbox Championships alongside American actor and beatboxer Michael Winslow. Yeff also took up a residency at famous celebrity haunt, The Box, and recorded a documentary with Sofar Sounds, a revolutionary music organisation who set up secretive gigs in people's homes. 'For some reason I seem to have had a massive influence on the American community, and I've felt that in my time here so much,' he said. Yeff also took the chance to challenge New York's famous chess hustlers - who play for cash in the city's Union Square - showcasing another of his talents, honed competing in chess tournaments as a teenager. He said: 'It's the one place where you really see the semi-ghetto vibe mixing with intellectual prowess. 'I used to turn up to chess tournaments with my flat caps and tracksuits and that energy has always really appealed to me.

Cerebellum activation in Reeps One (yellow) compared to a novice (pink). Neurologists compared their brains as they beatboxed. Yeff mostly used two brain areas while the novice used many more brain areas, suggesting a need to plan each sound and a lack of automatic processing . 'To go and win a few games and hustle the chess hustlers a little bit, was something to tick off the life 'to-do' list.' So impressive are his skills, scientists at University College London asked him to have a brain scan as part of a study to find out how someone's mind changes when they become an expert. Neurologists compared the brain activity of Yeff with a novice, while they both beatboxed. Yeff  mostly used two brain areas, including the cerebellum - responsible for learning complicated movements. The novice used many more brain areas, suggesting a need to plan each sound and a lack of automatic processing. Yeff can feel this natural automation as he performs, 'When I was on a project with a group of soloist musicians, a number of them said to me ""When we play our instrument it's an extension, but your voice is completely close to your mind"" and this is true. 'That's what makes my performance, I think, so connecting and engaging. It's not a mechanical block, it's shifting and changing and skewing all the time dependent on the reaction of the audience.'

"At one time, they might have left a pig’s head on the doorstep. But these days the Neapolitan mafia are increasingly employing ferocious and exotic animals, including crocodiles and tigers, to terrify their victims into paying their protection money, police say. Some bosses have been known to threaten victims by putting snakes in their car windows, while other clan members employ parrots as drug dealers. Sinister: In a scene worthy of a Bond film police confiscated a crocodile from the home of the nephew of a mob boss in Orta di Atella, outside Naples . In a scene worthy of a Bond film police confiscated a crocodile from the home of the nephew of a mob boss in Orta di Atella, outside Naples. It was used to scare businessmen who had not paid their protection fee or ‘pizzo’, due three times a year at Christmas, Easter and August Bank holiday, police said. The entrepreneurs would be weighed and then left on the terrace to keep the vicious beast ‘company’. ‘Pay up or you can be his next meal’, the business owners were told, according to Forestry police officials. Terrifying: One Mafia godfather ordered that a Siberian tiger be chained up outside his villa . Another group of heavies in the mafia-torn town of Villa Literno, instructed to send a warning to a debtor, left a ten foot boa constrictor in his car. The same thing happened to a policeman, soon afterwards, when a python was put through the window of his moving car in an apparent response to an operation a few days before. In the Traiano area of Naples police seized a pair of African grey parrots which has been trained to act as drug pushers . One godfather ordered that a Siberian tiger be chained up outside his villa. Another in the Avellino area near Naples placed a cage with two macaque monkeys in the middle of the room where he met his businesss associates. In the Traiano area of Naples police seized a pair of African grey parrots which has been trained to act as drug pushers. When a phone rang they would respond ‘Hello. How much do you need?' In stressful situations or when someone tried to take them out of their cage they would say, I’ll shoot you'. All the seized pets now live in a refuge for animals in judicial custody where they have 'a complete zoo, A-Z', police vets said. Police chief Marco Trapuzzano said ‘Recently the traffic of dangerous animals has reached frightening levels. ‘The Camorra are using animals such as snakes as their weapon of choice to intimidate people. Tigers, alligators, monkeys, snakes they are all used as a sign of power. 'They are a demonstration that the bosses can do whatever they want- even own ferocious animals that are feared by others. ‘The rarer the animal the more omnipotent the boss feels because it would be risky for someone to attack him at his home.' Prices rang from £400 for a boa with special colours to £24,000 to import a Siberian tiger, he said.","Gangs now employing ferocious and exotic animals to terrify victims .

"You might think that happy, healthy and educated kids don't give much thought to complex human rights issues, but Australian children are more socially aware than they are often given credit for. At just 10 years of age, Maddie Alfred already worries about complex issues such as child labour, child marriage and children in detention. 'Refugee children shouldn't be locked up they should have the same rights as us go to school and stuff,' Maddie said. Scroll down for video . Maddie Alfred (left) , 10, from West Pymble in Sydney, pictured with her sister . Maddie is one of a number of kids to feature in a global campaign to address children's rights (right) 'And also in poor countries they shouldn't have to work or get married at an early age.' But it's not just issues affecting children from overseas that Australian kids are worried about. New research shows that just one in seven Australian children think their friends are safe from violence or bullying. A global survey conducted by international aid group ChildFund Alliance found that 24 per cent of kids aged between 10 and 12 think that children's rights to protection in our country are not being met. The survey of more than 6000 kids also found just 14 per cent of Australian children said young people in our country are always protected from physical or psychological harm. Diana Masonis from ChildFund Australia said even though the issues are advanced for 10 to 12 year olds, Australian children are very socially aware. Lily Nigro, 12, from Lisarow on the NSW Central Coast, also appeared in the video . Lily, pictured with her dad Orlando Nigro on holiday in Fiji . 'Children were absolutely showing an awareness of the reality of their peers within their friends and at school,' Ms Masonis said. 'They were saying children who live in families experiencing domestic violence, those children's rights are not being upheld. 'There were lots of quotes saying children should be free from racism, that people being bullied for being themselves was wrong.' Ms Masonis said Australian children also showed compassion for children in situations less fortunate than themselves, recognising that not all young people have access to the four main rights of survival, development, protection and participation. 'They want the world to be fair,' she said. 'I think children in Australia have access to a lot of information and they're very interested in what's happening to their peers, other children in Australia and around the world.' The campaign marks the 25th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child . It is is aimed at ensuring more is done to address the breaches of human rights that still plague children around the world . This comes as Maddie, from West Pymble in Sydney, and other Australian children have featured alongside kids from around the world in a video addressed to world leaders. The campaign, which marks the 25th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, is aimed at ensuring more is done to address the breaches of human rights that still plague children around the world. Maddie said she thought the finished product looked very good. 'I thought it was quite clever, how they sort of take everyone's voice and put it into a sentence and how they all say the same thing, to show respect,' she said. 'I filmed it at my house, it was very tiring because we did it for three hours.' The 10-year-old said she often talks about children's rights with her family. More than 6000 children from 44 countries participated in a survey about children's rights and what they mean . Small Voices Big Dreams is one of the largest global polls of children’s views in the world . 'I think that um children's rights means even poor ones have the right to learn and grow to go to school and be treated nicely,' she said. 'And the right to be happy and not go to war, because I sort of know about how there's lots of things that have been happening in those countries.' But Maddie said she didn't think most kids in Australia really understood what child rights are. 'They take them all for granted, because we are quite lucky and we have money,' she said. 'And we get to go to school, well we have to go to school, and we get to have fun and play.' Lily Nigro, 12, from Lisarow on the NSW Central Coast, also appeared in the video said she thought children's rights included many different things. 'Being safe, being able to have food and water, being able to have shelter, being in a place where there's no wars and being with their families,' she said.","Just one in seven Australian children think their friends are safe from violence or bullying .

"Barack Obama does not need to ask Congress for permission to launch air strikes in Iraq, top lawmakers have said. After a meeting with Obama, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the president 'indicated he didn't feel he had any need for authority from us for steps that he might take.' Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House Minority Leader, said in a statement after the meeting that Obama does not need 'any further legislative authority' for the options discussed so far.

He . praised their efforts to bring together their respective communities in . a televised show of unity against the group Islamic State in Iraq and . the Levant (ISIS), the White House said. But former U.S. general David Petraeus, who led the 'surge' that finally brought calm to Iraq, struck a cautious note on Western intervention. Speaking at a conference in London, General Petraeus said the Iraqi government needed to reach out to the Sunni minority before the US got involved militarily. He said: 'If the US is to support the Iraqi government it would have to be a government against terrorism, rather than one side in a civil war.' 'This cannot be the United States being the air force for Shia militias, or a Shia-on-Sunni-Arab fight,' he told the Margaret Thatcher Conference on Liberty.

"Former SBS Dateline presenter Anjali Rao has broken her silence about why she quit her role hosting the respected current affairs show saying she needed a new challenge, but fears she may struggle to land a 'dream' role because of her distinctive British accent. Rao also told Daily Mail Australia rumours she left the show because of cuts announced to the ABC and SBS were untrue, but said: 'I might be doing them a favour by leaving'. The 40-year-old enjoyed a successful six-year stint at CNN International in Hong Kong but the lure of working in her homeland proved too much in early 2013 and she signed with SBS to host Dateline. But now, almost two years later, she believes another  challenge beckons. 'I am up for any broadcaster, commercial or public,' she told Daily Mail Australia, while  admitting there may be a problem with that plan. 'I am not going to deny that there have been issues surrounding my accent and I cannot say that I have experienced this at any time, anywhere in any country other than since moving to this country and this is my country, so it's been a little difficult,' she said. Scroll down for video . Anjali Rao had a successful broadcasting career with CNN before moving back to Australia to host Dateline on SBS two years back . How the popular presenter made her decision known on social media . Presenter and journalist Anjali Rao has quit after two years as host of SBS program Dateline and is seeking a new 'high octane' challenge in Australian TV . 'I get told on a multiple times, daily basis, ""oh my God, we love your accent"" where's that from and ordinary people love it which is great, fantastic. 'I went to boarding school in the UK which is what did this to my accent but people say to me ""when can you get back on TV because it's so distinctive we automatically know it's you, if we are not even watching or preparing the dinner or whatever, we know it's you"" and I think that is a really valuable thing. 'It means a huge amount to me as well because I am very proud of my accent. I would hope that it is not an obstacle also given my experience in this industry. 'One would hope that a silly little thing like my accent is not going to stand in the way of great things. 'I moved here for new opportunities and those are the sorts of things I want to now investigate. 'I love this country, I am half Australian, my mother is from Bendigo and my passport is Australian, it always has been, despite my accent. 'I am committed to staying here and I have a five year old son who lives here, I will be staying here.' 'I love this this country, I am half Australian, my mother is from Bendigo and my passport is Australian' Anjali Rao said that 'I had always planned at about this time, I have been incredibly fortunate to have hosted Dateline for the past two years it has just been an absolute privilege to work with these people' Hard news reporting and once-a-week programs behind her, Anjali Rao's eyes are now firmly fixed on in-depth interviewing roles. 'I had always planned (to resign) about this time, I have been incredibly fortunate to have hosted Dateline for the past two years it has just been an absolute privilege to work with these people. 'For me, I realised that I wanted something more. Dateline is just once a week and I come from a breaking news background, six years doing breaking news at CNN and prior to that breaking news at Sky News in London. So I come from a very high octane environment and I just wanted a bit more of that, I felt like as far as hosting Dateline was concerned I had done pretty much all that I could do.' The spectre of cutbacks didn't help, she admitted. 'I can't deny that when you see the writing on the wall with something like this, it certainly hurried things up in my mind. 'More than that, it just cemented what I was feeling was the right thing to do, that was to step down and you know if budget cuts are part of it then I might be doing them a favour by quitting.' Rao says of the imminent cutbacks at the public broadcaster that she feels sad for 'those wonderful people who are now going to be on the job-hunt I guess but they are such good journalists that I have absolutely no doubt they will go onto fabulous things' She leaves with a heavy heart, aware her colleagues face an uncertain future. 'I was always very sad of just myself leaving because I thought I won't get to see these fantastic people as often any more. That already made me sad but now with the sort of snowball-effect of what has happened, of course, I do feel a bit gutted. 'I do feel particularly sad for those wonderful people who are now going to be on the job-hunt I guess but they are such good journalists that I have absolutely no doubt they will go onto fabulous things.' She is proud at what the show achieved with her in the hot seat. 'The idea that we were actually hitting a quarter of a million in audience figures on a very frequent weekly basis shows there is a significant appetite for what we were serving up, which is incredibly encouraging. 'Then again if management saw something to which we are not privy to, in that the format was not working any more for whatever reason, they are totally within their rights to go ahead and change that format, there is nothing anyone can do, it is the nature of the industry. When she once was the face and voice of CNN International. Anjali Rao spent six years at the broadcaster in Hong Kong, fronting breakfast and talk shows . 'I have had 18 years of hard news but what I was best known for at CNN were two shows, my daily prime-time breakfast and also my weekly talk show, ""Talk Asia"" and that is the style of thing of what I would like to get back into. 'Meeting people, famous or otherwise and just finding out about their lives and what makes them who they are. Anybody who has got a story, that's essentially what I am into, more like psychological journalism. 'I've done enough of the hard news I want to get into the interviewing one-on-one, finding real slice of life stories, that's absolutely where my passion lies.'

"Astronomers believe the Cassini spacecraft has spotted Saturn’s rings giving birth to a new moon. Named ‘Peggy’, the baby moon sits on the very edge of Saturn's A ring - the outermost of the planet's large, bright rings. It was first discovered exactly one year ago by Professor Carl Murray of Queen Mary University and was named after his mother-in-law. The thin, outermost ring shown in this picture from the Cassini probe is Saturn's F ring, and the bright dot near it is the moon Prometheus. The thicker white band is the A ring. The smudge in the red circle near what looks like the tip of that ring was created by Peggy . In a chance discovery, Professor Murray spotted disturbances on the A ring, with one showing an arc that was 20 per cent brighter than its surroundings. The arc, which is 750 miles (1,200 km) long and 6 miles (10 km) wide, is thought to have been created by the gravitational effects of the new moon. At present, the scientists estimate Peggy is probably no more than around half a mile (0.8 km) in diameter. Published in the journal Icarus, the researchers predict the new moon will remain the same size, and may even be falling apart . Saturn is known to have of 53 natural with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings. On Saturn, a full year is the equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning Cassini has only been able to observe a third of a Saturn year . Launched in 1997, Cassini has been exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004. On . Saturn, a full year is the equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning . Cassini has only been able to observe a third of a Saturn year. Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer. Cassini . has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving . there in 2004, also observing Jupiter, the heliosphere, and testing the . theory of relativity . Cassini is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit, and its mission is on going as of 2013. But the process of its formation and outward movement helps in the understanding of how Saturn's icy moons formed. ‘We have not seen anything like this before,’ said Carl Murray of Queen Mary University of London, and the report's lead author. ‘We may be looking at the act of birth, where this object is just leaving the rings and heading off to be a moon in its own right.’ Peggy could help explain how the cloud-wrapped Titan and ocean-holding Enceladus, may have formed in more massive rings long ago. It also provides insight into how Earth and other planets in our solar system may have formed and migrated away from the sun. Saturn's icy moons range in size depending on their proximity to the planet - the farther from the planet, the larger. And many of Saturn's moons are comprised primarily of ice, as are the particles that form Saturn's rings. Based on these facts, and other indicators, researchers recently proposed that the icy moons formed from ring particles and then moved outward, away from the planet, merging with other moons on the way. Last year, hundreds of objects up to half a mile in diameter were caught on camera wreaking havoc with one of Saturn's rings. From left to right in the top row, the trails in these images are 18, 85 and 96 miles long. In the bottom row from left to right, the trails are 43, 129 and 32 miles long .

Based . on these facts, and other indicators, researchers recently proposed . that the icy moons formed from ring particles and then moved outward, . away from the planet, merging with other moons on the way. ‘Witnessing the possible birth of a tiny moon is an exciting, unexpected event,’ said Cassini Project Scientist Linda Spilker, of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. According to Ms Spilker, Cassini's orbit will move closer to the outer edge of the A ring in late 2016 and provide an opportunity to study Peggy in more detail and perhaps even image it. It is possible the process of moon formation in Saturn's rings has ended with Peggy, as Saturn's rings now are, in all likelihood, too depleted to make more moons. Because they may not observe this process again, Professor Murray and his colleagues are trying to learn all they can from these observations. ‘The theory holds that Saturn long ago had a much more massive ring system capable of giving birth to larger moons,’ Professor Murray said. ‘As the moons formed near the edge, they depleted the rings and evolved, so the ones that formed earliest are the largest and the farthest out.’ Last year, hundreds of objects up to half a mile in diameter were caught on camera wreaking havoc with one of Saturn’s rings. The objects were actually snowballs created by some of Saturn’s 60 moons, like Prometheus. At the time of the discovery, Professor Murray said, ‘I think the F ring is Saturn's weirdest ring, and these latest Cassini results go to show how the F ring is even more dynamic than we ever thought.’","Moon sits on edge of Saturn's A ring - the outermost the planet's rings .

"We all dream of living a long, happy life - often in a warmer, more relaxing climate than we are currently based. But where are the happiest places in the world? A new map of 151 countries has revealed exactly which parts of the globe deliver long and happy  lives for their citizens, within the environmental limits of the planet. And the results may surprise you, with Costa Rica, Colombia and Vietnam topping the league. The UK features at position 44 - higher than Germany (47), Spain (62), Canada (65), Australia (76) and the US (105). The map was compiled by the relocation website Movehub, using data from the latest Happy Planet Index (HPI) - a global measure of sustainable wellbeing. The HPI claims it 'measures what matters', rather than wealth: the extent to which countries deliver long, happy, sustainable lives for the people that live in them. Scroll down for video . A new map of 151 countries has revealed exactly which parts of the world deliver long and happy lives for their citizens, within the environmental limits of the planet. Each of the three component measures – life expectancy, the level of well-being experienced and ecological footprint – is given a traffic-light score based on thresholds for good (green), middling (amber) and bad (red) performance.These scores are combined to an expanded six-colour traffic light for the overall HPI score, where, to achieve bright green – the best of the six colours, a country would have to perform well on all three individual components . Each of the three component measures – life expectancy, the level of well-being experienced and ecological footprint – is given a traffic-light score based on thresholds for good (green), middling (amber) and bad (red) performance. These scores are combined to an expanded six-colour traffic light for the overall HPI score, where, to achieve bright green – the best of the six colours, a country would have to perform well on all three individual components. In order to compile the data, researchers directly asked people in each country for their views. Experienced well-being: This was assessed using a question called the ‘Ladder of Life’ from the Gallup World Poll. This asks respondents to imagine a ladder, where 0 represents the worst possible life and 10 the best possible life, and report the step of the ladder they feel they currently stand on. Life expectancy: Alongside experienced well-being, the Happy PIanet Index includes a universally important measure of health – life expectancy.

The HPI uses the Ecological Footprint promoted by the environmental charity WWF as a measure of resource consumption. It is a per capita measure of the amount of land required to sustain a country’s consumption patterns, measured in terms of global hectares (g ha) which represent a hectare of land with average productive biocapacity. Two of the three main factors are directly about happiness. The third (Ecological footprint) is regarded as sustainable happiness. i.e. whether a country could sustain its citizens without any outside help. The idea is that if there was an incident which cut a country completely off from the outside world, or a country had to be completely self-sufficient, most of the developed world would be unable to do that (without losing a lot of its population first). The reason for some high-income nations to score significantly below other nations is the ecological footprint left on the planet. The map also doesn't take into account internal inequality measures and human rights issues which is why some countries like Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia feature so highly .

Costa Rica, Colombia and Vietnam topping the happiness league. The map was compiled using data from the latest Happy Planet Index (HPI) - a global measure of sustainable wellbeing . The HPI (Happy Planet Index) puts at the heart the idea that happiness is not necessarily about wealth, but living long lives with a high experience of well-being. The idea is that if a country had to be completely self-sufficient, most of the developed world would be unable to do that (without losing a lot of its population first).The reason for some high-income nations to score significantly below other nations is the ecological footprint left on the planet . Each of the three component measures – life expectancy, the level of well-being experienced and ecological footprint – is given a traffic-light score based on thresholds for good (green), middling (amber) and bad (red) performance . Mexicans and Canadians both appear to be happier than their U.S. neighbour - most likely due to the country's ecological footprint .

"Ian Horridge, 44, drowned during a deep sea dive while was on holiday in Norway in June this year . An adventurer known as 'Action Man' drowned  in Norway just moments after sending his wife a picture captioned: 'If Carlsberg did dives, they would probably be the best dives in the world'. Ian Horridge, 44, was on holiday off the coast of Bremanger in June this year as part of a week-long diving expedition in the Fjords. The father-of-one, from Urmston, Greater Manchester, was about to take part in a 50-metre scuba dive above a Second World War shipwreck when he texted a picture of the water to his wife Sandra. But as Mr Horridge was swimming to a buoy above the the wreck, he suddenly passed out and free-fell to the bottom of the sea. A fellow diver found Mr Horridge - who had more than 20 years' diving experience - lying chest-up on the shipwreck with his mouthpiece loose. Mr Horridge, who was diving along with 12 other enthusiasts, was flown by helicopter to Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen but was later pronounced dead. His 63-year-old wife, who described Mr Horridge as a 'larger than life' character, had text her husband back but believes he never received the message. An inquest into his death in Stockport heard how there is no clear evidence about exactly how Mr Horridge died. But something 'dramatic, sudden and significant' happened as he was starting to descend, which caused him to pass out. The court heard how Mr Horridge had already completed three successful deep-sea dives in the days before his death and gave no indication that he was feeling unwell or there was a problem with his equipment. The structural engineer was also described as being 'meticulous' in checking his breathing gases, which experts say appeared to be functioning properly. But the court heard how Mr Horridge, who set off to explore with 12 other divers, probably died after losing consciousness due to a lack of oxygen to his brain. The court heard he also had an enlarged heart, for which he had undergone surgery in 2005. Coroner John Pollard said: 'The experts have confirmed it would appear there were no equipment failures and as far as possible to check, the breathing gases were checked. 'I've heard divers would breathe through their equipment for 2-3 minutes and would then swim on the surface to the area where the shot line is located. 'At that point something dramatic, sudden and significant happened. My very firm belief is he had lost all consciousness as he started to descend and was completely oblivious as to what was happening to him.' The father-of-one, from Urmston, Greater Manchester, sent this photo with the caption: 'If Carlsberg did dives, they would probably be the best dives in the world' before embarking on 50-metre scuba dive . During the hearing, Mr Horridge was described as an avid 'technical diver' - a term coined to describe those who dive at greater depths than conventional scuba diving and stay underwater longer. The hearing heard how technical divers do not usually use conventional air because it creates a high risk of oxygen toxicity. Instead, they add gases such as helium to the air mix so they are able to use their equipment at greater depths. The court heard that Mr Horridge could have suffered from a lack of oxygen in his air mix, something which is imperative for the diver's safety. His wife Sandra, 63, (pictured left with their son Adam Steel) replied to her husband's final message but believes the father-of-two (pictured right) did not receive it . Giving evidence at the hearing, fellow diver Robert Braithwaite said Mr Horridge started off 'very controlled' but soon fell in trouble. He said: 'I started my descent down the shot line and at about 10metres I stopped to sort something out with my equipment. 'I saw Ian going down free-diving on to the wreck. He looked very controlled and totally co-ordinated without errors or issues. If anything I thought he was going slightly quickly but he might have been wanting to get his oxygen pressures up. 'Unfortunately as I got over within 30 seconds I realised he was on his back and when I got down to his level - about 50 metres - I realised he was in trouble.' Mr Braithwaite described how he tried to grab Mr Horridge's his hand to pull him up, but his glove came off. Mr Horridge, a structural engineer, pictured with his wife, had been diving for 20 years and was always 'meticulous' in checking his equipment, the inquest heard . He said: 'It was a very dead weight. There was no buoyancy. I realised it was Ian and got hold of him and pulled him by hand to get him to the surface. 'I had to somehow get buoyancy into the system to get him to the surface. I got air into a valve and he started to rise and I rode him to the surface. It was faster than I should have gone in order to be safe. 'We got him on to a platform and then on to the deck. By looking at Ian I thought he was dead - I wish I could have done more.' Mr Horridge, also a keen cyclist, was given his 'Action Man' nickname after travelling all over the world to deep-sea dive . Mark Evans, another diver on the trip, said it is imperative for divers to have enough oxygen in their unit before they descend. He said: 'Swimming to the buoy is the most difficult part. Your equipment is very heavy. 'You are swimming against the current, working quite hard but the gas in your unit is only 10 per cent oxygen so you have to make sure you have enough before you descend. 'If something is wrong and the oxygen hasn't auto-injected when you get to the top of the shot line you could fall asleep. 'You have lights and sirens that would tell you if it isn't working properly and they flash and you can check your computer but if you miss them you can pass out. That's the most dangerous part. 'If your loop [mouthpiece] falls out your mouth and the unit floods with water it will take you down'. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Pollard described Mr Horridge as 'fit and well', despite having had surgery for an enlarged heart in 2005. He had also been treated for 'the bends' during a previous expedition. Mr Pollard added: 'Mr Horridge was an experienced diver and described by those who dived with him as careful and meticulous in his preparations and executions.' After the hearing Mrs Horridge, a bank worker, said: 'Ian was a larger-than-life character and a very active man. 'He always told me not to worry and on his last dive he sent me the picture of where he was about to dive and said, ""If Carlsberg did dives, they would probably be the best dives in the world."" 'I texted him straight back but he obviously didn't get the message. He used to say, ""Life isn't a dress rehearsal, you have to live it."" He did more in 44 years than most people do in their lifetime.' Mr Horridge got his nickname from his family because he travelled all over the world to take part in deep-sea dives. The expedition had set off from Bergen to explore the wreckage of the German steamship Helga Ferdinand which was bombed by British Beaufighters and sank in the Midtgulenfjord in 1944.","Ian Horridge, 44, was on week-long diving expedition in the Fjords in June .

"For newlywed Kirsty Taylor-Pendlebury, thinking of her wedding day brings a tear to the eye. But they are not the tears of joy you would expect. Rather, reliving the day - which was four years in the planning - conjures up memories of being rushed to hospital with her new husband Carl, both struck by violent food poisoning. The 26-year-olds managed to quickly utter the words 'I do' before their wedding planner called an ambulance. The newlyweds from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, were left doubled over in agony, suffering vomiting and diarrhoea on their £14,000 big day. Once admitted to hospital, the couple spent their first night as husband and wife in adjacent hospital beds. Newlyweds Kirsty Taylor-Pendlebury and her husband Carl, on their wedding day in Turkey on August 8. The couple ended up in hospital after being struck down by food poisoning . The devastated maths teacher said she cannot stomach looking at their wedding album, because she and her husband look so unwell in the pictures. She said it will take them years to save enough to pay for another wedding, because they are still paying for the first, after using credit cards to fund their 'dream' big day. Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury said: ‘We are heartbroken. I can't think of our wedding day without wanting to cry. 'We’d planned our day for years and I still can’t believe it was totally ruined. ‘Your wedding is supposed to be one of the happiest days of your life, but ours was like hell and we are still paying for it every month which means we can’t save for another.’ The couple who met at school when they were 14, got engaged in 2010 after graduating from the same university. They soon began planning their big day and eventually decided on an idyllic waterside wedding in the sun. In 2012, Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury booked a luxury ceremony in Oludeniz, Turkey, to take place in August this year and began planning all the final details, including arriving at the service by speed boat. The couple spent their first night as husband and wife in hospital suffering gastroenteritis . The couple flew out to meet their guests from the UK in perfect health. But when they woke days later on the morning of the ceremony on August 8, Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury complained of stomach cramps. She said: ‘They were getting worse but everyone was convinced it was just wedding day nerves. 'They kept telling me to calm down and I hoped they were right.’ But the pain worsened when she was having her hair and make up done and guests reported that the groom was also suffering. Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury said: ‘I had never felt so ill. I was holding my stomach in agony with cramps and I couldn’t stay off the toilet. ‘When I heard Carl was the same I thought we were never going to make it down the aisle.’ When the best man reported the groom was curled up in the foetal position on the bathroom floor in their hotel suite Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury wanted to cancel the ceremony. She said: ‘Carl insisted that we carry on. We had waited so long to get married but it was turning into a nightmare.’ While on the speedboat left Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury was forced to lie on the floor of the boat trying not to vomit on her wedding gown. When she arrived at the beach she was shocked to see just how ill her groom looked. ‘Carl was green,' she said. 'He was pacing up and down and sweating buckets with a fever. I was worried sick.’ They managed to speedily exchange vows before Mr Pendlebury had to dash off to the toilet again leaving his bride to toast their wedding alone. She said: ‘I could hardly raise the glass to my lips because the smell of alcohol when she you fell that sick is horrendous.’ Both were unable to face the lavish wedding feast they had splashed out on. Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury, said: ‘The sight of food when you feel like you are dying is horrific. 'We had to walk away and poor Carl was vomiting into the sea while we waited for guests to finish their meals. Suffering vomiting and diarrhoea, the couple could not face trying the wedding breakfast they had chosen . ‘The heat made it even worse because we were both sweating with fevers.’ The couple were left gagging when they cut the wedding cake and spent their first dance rooted to the spot trying not to throw up. With bride and groom spending more time on the toilet than with their guests they had to admit defeat, instructing the wedding planner to end their celebration two hours early. Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury said: ‘Trying to get a wedding dress on and off to go to the toilet is hard enough at the best of times, let alone when you are in a hurry. I just wanted the whole thing to be over with.’ But first the struggling couple were taken back to the speedboat for their wedding pictures. Mrs Taylor –Pendlebury said: ‘I was crying and lying down holding my stomach between shots but doing my best to smile for the camera because I wanted to have at least one nice picture of us on our wedding day after waiting for it for so long. 'Carl turned bright green every time we hit a wave. We couldn't wait to get off it.’ Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury said: 'We’d planned our day for years and I still can’t believe it was totally ruined' The couple's wedding planner was forced to call an ambulance after Mr Pendlebury became so ill he could no longer enjoy the reception. They were forced to cut short their big day by two hours . During the cruise back to the hotel with their guests Mr Taylor was so unwell that their worried wedding planner called an ambulance. When they docked it was waiting to rush him straight to a local hospital where he was diagnosed with severe dehydration and gastroenteritis. Desperate to stay with her groom on their wedding night, the newlyweds were moved to a room in the maternity ward where Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury slept next to her husband in a camp bed. She said: ‘We were too ill and upset to even talk. It’s not how either of us imagined our wedding night. The whole thing had been a disaster.’ The groom was discharged the following morning and the newlyweds spent the next five days in their hotel room recovering. Meanwhile several other wedding guests started suffering the same symptoms and were also diagnosed with gastroenteritis. Mrs Taylor said: ‘We had eaten at several local restaurants so it could have been any of them that made us ill.’ The couple cannot afford to pay for another wedding because they are still paying for the first, having put the majority of the cost on credit cards . Family and friends are hoping to raise money to help the couple pay for a new ceremony to replace their bad memories for their first big day . But it was only when she started to feel well again that the true cost of their wedding disaster hit home. She said: ‘I just couldn’t stop crying. The wedding we had looked forward too for so many years had been totally ruined. ‘It was horrific. We both flew home feeling utterly distraught and disappointed. ‘When I saw the wedding pictures we both looked so sweaty and sick I couldn’t even stomach looking at them.’ But the couple won’t be able to afford to pay for a new wedding until they finish paying for this one. Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury said: ‘We don’t earn a lot so we put most of it on credit cards. 'Seeing the payment go out every week for a wedding both of us would rather forget about is soul destroying.' Friends and family are now trying to help the couple raise funds for a new ceremony to replace the bad memories of their last one. Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury said: ‘We would love to have a ceremony where neither of us is dashing of to the toilet or vomiting.’","Teenage sweethearts Kirsty and Carl tied the knot in Turkey in August .

"An 'average-looking' doll, complete with acne and stretch marks, has gone on sale this morning after a successful crowdfunding campaign. Artist Nickolay Lamm, 26, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, created 'Lammily' based on government measurements of an average 19-year-old American woman, wanting to offer an alternative to Barbie and other fashion dolls that perpetuate outrageously unrealistic beauty standards. 'I think a realistic sized doll is important because, when I look at current dolls on the market, I can’t help but notice how disproportionate they are,' Mr Lamm told Salon. Scroll down for video . Realistic: Lammily, an 'average-looking' doll that features stick-on cellulite, stretch marks and other imperfections, went on sale this morning . Things that go bump: Lammily also has stick-on acne, seen here on her forehead . The 11-inch doll, now available on Lammily.com for $25, comes dressed in an ombre denim shirt, shorts and white sneakers. A variety of stylish ensembles, all inspired by cosmopolitan cities such as New York, London and Paris, are sold separately. But her most unusual accessory is a $6 packet of Lammily Marks - a selection of 38 reusable stickers that resemble acne, cellulite, freckles, moles, stitches, scrapes, bruises, mosquito bites and other imperfections. After Mr Lamm launched a crowdfunding campaign in March, 13,621 backers pre-ordered more than 19,000 dolls totaling $501,384. Thick skin: The doll even has a stick-on scar, in case she suffers any pretend injuries . Sold separately: Lammily Marks, which cost $6, include 38 reusable stickers that resemble freckles, moles, bruises and other imperfections . Each model features average proportions of a typical 19-year-old girl (32-31-33), a light amount of make-up and bendy joints. If the dolls are a success, he plans to extend the range to 'embrace diversity, from race to body type.' In his research, Mr Lamm found that, scaled up to human size, Barbie dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36-18-33, compared with the typical 19-year-old girl's 32-31-33. What's more, while the average 19-year-old is a modest 5ft 4"" tall, Barbie would have a supermodel stature and would be a relatively lofty 5ft 8"". Thanks to her ultra-slender measurements, it has been estimated that, if she were to exist as a human, Barbie would weigh about 110lbs and would have a BMI of 16.24. This would fit the weight criteria for anorexia, as a healthy BMI range is between 18.5 and 24.9. Average teen: Mr Lamm created Lammily based on government measurements of a real 19-year-old American woman . Crumbs and all: He wanted to offer an alternative to Barbie and other fashion dolls that perpetuate outrageously unrealistic beauty standards . Mr Lamm's hope is to promote a more positive body image to children. 'I wanted to show that average is beautiful. Rather than waiting for change to happen, let's be the change,' he says in a YouTube video for his crowdfunding campaign. He concludes: '[It's] so that our girls can grow up to become happier, stronger women, truly confident and proud in their own bodies.' Mr Lamm consulted with Robert Rambeau, former vice president of manufacturing at Mattel, for advice on finding a suitable manufacturer to produce his Lammily line. Frustrated: 'I think a realistic sized doll is important because, when I look at current dolls on the market, I can’t help but notice how disproportionate they are,' he said . Woman of the world: A variety of stylish ensembles, inspired by cosmopolitan cities such as New York, London and Barcelona (pictured), are sold separately . While the production process took months to figure out, Mr Lamm said the biggest challenge will be getting children to go for something new. Attempts at average-sized dolls in the past have not been successful, he says, but he believes that's because the 'average size' message wasn't appealing to kids. 'It would be like me trying to feed them broccoli,' he joked to Fast Company. Instead the entrepreneur wants children to see 'a cool-looking doll' and he will not push the 'average-looking' message too hard. In demand: After Mr Lamm launched a crowdfunding campaign in March, 13,621 backers pre-ordered more than 19,000 dolls . Curvy girl: Scaled to human size, Lammily would have measurements of 32-31-33, while tiny-waisted Barbie's proportions would be 36-18-33 . The public appear to be supportive of Mr Lamm's empowering goal. 'Awe this is awesome. [The Lammily doll] looks just like me! Thank you for making me feel beautiful!' one commenter said. And another added: 'Thank God someone finally created an ""average Barbie"" ... I love it! I hope by the time i have kids myself Lammily will have taken over the market.'","Lammily, created by artist Nickolay Lamm, has a figure based on government measurements of an average 19-year-old American woman .

"Britons will have to be mindful of protecting their skin in the coming days of surprisingly strong sunshine to avoid sunburn (pictured) A lobster-red sunburn is not a good look on anyone and can result in painful blistering and long-term skin damage. Now Britons will have to be more careful than ever of protecting their skin in the coming days of surprisingly strong sunshine. This is because a recently formed ozone hole over the UK is allowing high levels of potentially harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays to travel through the atmosphere, increasing the risk of fair skin being burned. The ozone layer in the Earth’s stratosphere usually prevents most of the UV rays reaching people far below. Every year ozone levels over Antarctica and sometimes the Arctic, plummet because of the use of CFCs by humans and ozone from other areas fill the gap. Consequently, UV levels in Britain have soared in recent days with the formation of a new ozone hole. As skin has been swathed in warm clothes over winter, it has not had time to acclimatise to UV by making a brown pigment called melanin, which protects the DNA in skin cells against damage from UV rays by absorbing the incoming radiation. People particularly susceptible to sunburn also have to be careful at this time of year, as although temperature may not be as high as summer, the light is still powerful as the sun is higher in the sky. John O’Hagen of Public Health England told The Times: ‘There’s more sunburn at Easter than the middle of June’. ‘It’s not necessarily hot, but the levels of ultraviolet in sunshine are rising and if there’s an ozone hole it exacerbates the problem.’ The ozone hole is an annual thinning of the ozone layer over Antarctica, caused by stratospheric chlorine. Smaller areas of thinning are known as ozone holes. Every year ozone layers over Antarctica fall drastically during the Southern Hemisphere's spring and the Arctic can be affected too. Experts think this started happening in the 1970s as a result of the use of CFCs, which were popularly found in aerosols, How Stuff Works explained. The hole forms in the Antarctic because cold air is trapped by strong circulating winds and leads to the formation of ice clouds, which break down chlorine-containing compounds, because of our use of CFCs. This makes the area especially susceptible to ozone depletion. To plug the gap, ozone from other areas returns over the affected poles every year. But small holes still occur elsewhere. Sun worshipers beware! A recent ozone hole over the UK is allowing high levels of potentially harmful ultraviolet rays to travel through the atmosphere and burn fair skin. The ozone layer in the Earth's stratosphere (illustrated) usually prevents most of the UV rays reaching people far below . Experts advise wearing a summer hat – even though it is Springtime – especially between 11am and 3pm when the sunshine is at its strongest. They think that people are caught unawares by the danger of being burned as they sit outside for longer and do not get so hot at this time of year. While there are warnings that an ozone hole will be over Britain over the Easter Bank Holiday, cloudy weather is forecast, which will act as a filter to stop the worst of the UV rays getting through. The weather is expected to be cloudy and rainy next week. While it is important to protect skin against the harmful effects of sunburn, including premature ageing and an increased risk of skin cancer, experts have also stressed the health benefits of being outside so that our bodies get enough Vitamin D. Being outside in the sunshine has also been linked to lower blood pressure and lowering the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Skin cells detect UV light using a photosensitive receptor previously thought to only exist in the eye, according to a 2011 study. The receptors sense light and trigger the production of melanin within hours - more quickly than previously thought - in a rush to protect against damage to DNA. 'As soon as you step out into the sun, your skin knows that it is exposed to UV radiation,' said senior author Elena Oancea, assistant professor of biology in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Physiology and Biotechnology at Brown University in Rhode Island. 'This is a very fast process, faster than anything that was known before.' Scientists believe that melanin protects the DNA in skin cells against damage from UV rays by absorbing the incoming radiation and while it is effective, it isn’t perfect, which is why people must use sun block to protect their skin. The study showed that the body mounts its defence much sooner than thought and well before it becomes apparent in the form of a tan. Previously, scientists only knew that melanin production occurred days after UV radiation had already begun damaging DNA.","A hole in the ozone layer over the UK is allowing high levels of ultraviolet rays to travel through the Earth's stratosphere .

"Some people keep guinea pigs or hamsters as pets. But in Cuba, where a larger, more exotic rodent runs wild, Ana Pedraza and her husband prefer the hutia. With a rope-like tail and long front teeth, the hutia grows more than half a metre in length, weighs the same as a dog and has the appearance of a giant rat. Now Mrs Pedraza and her husband Rafael Lopez have made it their mission to save the maligned creatures - by domesticating them with kisses, car rides and nips of rum. Scroll down for video . Rafael Lopez steadies a rum bottle as his pet hutia Pancho takes a sip while balancing on his back feet . Mr Lopez calls the hutia 'a precious, curious and very intelligent little animal'. Here Pancho is pictured perched on top of Mr Lopez's car . Congui, a domesticated hutia, rides on the front door of the classic car driven by Mr Lopez . Rafael Lopez sticks out his tongue infused with rum for his pet hutia, called Pancho, in Bainoa, Cuba . The couple say they only want to want to protect and take care of the animals, which are often killed for food on the Caribbean islands to which they are endemic. They began collecting hutias about five years ago when they found one languishing on a roadside and named her Congui. Not long after, they found her a mate and now have more than a half-dozen hutias in their home, about  25 miles east of the capital, Havana. The couple claim Congui and her family like to drink sweetened coffee and munch on crackers and vegetables. Congui's son Pancho also enjoys an occasional nip of rum - which is delivered to him on the tongue of Mr Lopez. While some hutias can be aggressive, the couple claim they have found the huge rodents to be wonderful companions. Mr Lopez called the hutia 'a precious, curious and very intelligent little animal'. Pancho is the son of the couple's first pet hutia. Here he is pictured taking a closer took at the camera . The hutia is a large rodent endemic to the Caribbean islands which can grow more than half a metre in length. Although they look like giant rats, they are more closely related to the much cuter guinea pigs and hamsters. Though they are generally herbivores, some variations of the hutia (many of which are now extinct) eat small insects and reptiles. Remarkably, there is an overabundance of the rodents at the Guantanamo military base in Cuba due to a lack of predators. However, across the rest of the country, a single hutia is revered for its ability to feed an entire family - usually once it is stewed with nuts and honey, and served with sauce.

Arrest: Jesse Matthew, 32, has been arrested in connection with the disappearance of Hannah, right . Teams have searched 95 per cent of an eight-mile radius around the area she was last seen, WVIR reported. Tips are also sparking searches of specific areas, authorities said. Graham had left an off-campus party on her own before she vanished. She was captured on surveillance video and by witnesses with 32-year-old Matthew. After eluding authorities and fleeing to Texas, he was later arrested and charged with abduction with the intent to defile in connection with the case. He is currently behind bars. Since his arrest, Matthew, a nursing assistant, has been linked by DNA evidence to the disappearance of 20-year-old Morgan Harrington.

"The number of internet trolls convicted in court of bullying online has soared by more than 150 per cent in just four years. New figures show more than 1,200 people last year were convicted of sending offensive, obscene or threatening electronic messages - up from just 498 in 2007. After several high profile cases involving celebrities and families grieving for loved ones being targeted on Twitter, Facebook and chatrooms, police have become more willing to use the full force of the law. The number of convictions for sending offensive, indecent or menacing electronic messages in England and Wales has soared from 498 in 2007 to 1,286 in 2011 . But prosecutors have also warned the criminal justice system could become overwhelmed with cases. In August, classical singer Katherine . Jenkins called in police after Twitter users threatened to ‘cut’ her . over false rumours she had an affair with David Beckham. Director . of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer has promised that prosecutors will . be given new guidance on dealing with social media cases, after a surge . in complaints. In . September he ruled out taking legal action against Daniel Thomas, a . semi-professional footballer who posted a homophobic tweet about Olympic . diving star Tom Daley . ‘The time has come for an informed debate about the boundaries of free speech in an age of social media,’ Mr Starmer said. This month Mr Starmer was reported as . suggesting new guidelines could mean only popular Twitter users are . prosecuted for offensive comment in future. Chief Constable Andy Trotter, ACPO lead on e-crime, said:  'The increase in reports of indecent, threatening or offensive messages sent on social media places an extra demand on police and that is only likely to increase. 'ACPO looks forward to the Crown Prosecution Service’s guidance to police and prosecutors on this issue and will participate in the  consultation process. Many offensive comments are made every day on social media and guidance will assist the police to focus on the most serious matters.' Classical singer Katherine Jenkins faced death threats on Twitter this summer while prosecutors decided not to take action against a footballer who posted an abusive message about Olympic swimmer Tom Daley . A breakdown of data for England and . Wales reveals the South East to be the trolling capital of the nation, . with 816 people found guilty from 2007-11. Crime prevention minister Jeremy Browne told MailOnline: 'What is illegal offline is illegal online. People should not be able to use social media to post anonymous abusive or threatening comments without facing any consequences. 'We have robust legislation in place to deal with internet trolls, cyber-stalking and harassment but we recognise that having these laws is not enough on its own. That is why we are working with the Crown Prosecution Service and the police to improve guidance and training for police and prosecutors. 'Prevention is also key and the government is working with industry, academia, charities and parenting groups to develop tools to combat misuse of social networking sites.' Under . Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 it is an offence to ‘send by . means of a public electronic communications network a message or other . matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing . character’. Trolls . can also be charged if, for the purpose of causing annoyance, . inconvenience or needless anxiety to another, they send an electronic . message which they know is false. In 2010, Colm Coss, from Manchester, . was jailed for 18 weeks under Section 127 after posting obscene messages . on Facebook tribute sites, including one for former Big Brother star . Jade Goody. In 2010, Colm Coss was convicted after posting offensive comments on a tribute page set up for former Big Brother star Jade Goody . Offenders convicted under Section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to £5,000 . Last month Matthew Woods, 19, from Chorley, Lancashire, was jailed for 18 weeks after posting explicit comments and jokes about April and Madeleine McCann. Also in October Azhar Ahmed, 20, of Fir Avenue, Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire, was ordered to carry out 240 hours community service and pay a fine of £300 after posting an offensive message on Facebook about the deaths of six British soldiers. He wrote: ‘All soldiers should die and go to hell.’ Official figures suggest around three . quarters of cases result in a conviction. Offenders can be jailed for . up to six months and fined up to £5,000. In . 2007, 498 people were successfully convicted under Section 127, . including 96 in the South East. It has risen sharply each year to top . 1,286 in 2011, including 227 in the South East. Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer has said new guidelines are needed to help prosecutors to deal with a surge in complaints about messages posted online . In total, there have been 4,536 successful prosecutions from 2007-11. Labour MP Andrew Gwynne, who obtained the figures in parliamentary questions, said:  MP said:‘Given . the massive growth in the internet and other media like Twitter and . Facebook, it is hardly surprising that there has been such an increase . in harassment convictions over the electronic media. 'It is important that there are guidelines governing the internet to ensure it isn’t used to harass people.’ In a debate on the subject last . month, media minister Ed Vaizey said: ‘This Government are committed to . tackling trolling, cyber-bullying and other forms of abuse and misuse of . social networking sites.’ He rejected calls for new laws, insisting Section 127 had been proven to be effective. ‘It . has been established that abuse posted on social media sites, such as . Facebook and Twitter, can be prosecuted under that Act and, as case law . develops in that area, we will see swift action when such cases arise,’ he added. Section . 127 was used to prosecute Paul Chambers over a tweet he sent after . being delayed at Doncaster Airport. He wrote: ‘Crap! Robin Hood Airport . is closed. You’ve got a week and a bit to get your shit together . otherwise I am blowing the airport sky high!!’ The conviction was eventually quashed by an appeal court. Jeremy . Todd, chief executive of BullyingUK, said:  ‘Trolling is . straightforwardly bullying: intimidation and harassment perpetrated by a . person who feels anonymous because they don't have to use their real . Identity. ‘People across the UK – young and old alike - really need to think carefully before they get involved in what might be seemingly harmless and imagine how it will be taken by the person, or their family, on the receiving end. ‘Actions on the Internet can have real consequences and the law is clear that using a communication system to harass or intimidate another person is an offence. 'The law protects those on the receiving end of trolling behaviour, as recent cases have shown: trolls are not beyond the long arm of the law.’","Just 498 cyberbullies were convicted in 2007 but by last year the number had rocketed to 1,286 .

"THE GOLDEN AGE OF PANTOMIME : SLAPSTICK, SPECTACLE AND SUBVERSION in Victorian England by Jeffrey Richards (I. B. Tauris £25) Often, I wonder what foreigners must think of us come Christmas time? The pantomime tradition is so wonderfully and eccentrically uniquely British. The daft catchphrases (‘It’s behind you!’; ‘Oh no it isn’t’; ‘Oh yes it is!’), the oo-err-missus vulgarity of frilly knickers and bras made of colanders, the ugly, old blokes playing women, the girls in tights playing chaps, the cows and horses, which are evidently two people in a silly costume. The whole thing is topsy-turvy and corny, and yet even illustrious thespians like Sir Ian McKellen can’t wait to show the public his Widow Twankey. I think he played Widow Twankey before he played King Lear, which gives you an idea of his priorities. Deliberately uncool, pantomime expresses our nutty national temperament . Deliberately uncool, pantomime expresses our nutty national temperament. As Richards says in this unnecessarily sombre tome, pantomime always revolved around slapstick, gender role reversal and topical allusion. The latter is what is lost to us — Victorian jokes about Captain Webb (the first person to swim the Channel) are on the obscure side now. The first thing Queen Victoria did after her Coronation in 1839 was visit the pantomime in Drury Lane, thus making the entertainment ‘one of the most popular exhibitions of our metropolis’, according to contemporary reports. The whole thing is topsy-turvy and corny, and yet even illustrious thespians like Sir Ian McKellen can’t wait to show the public his Widow Twankey . Later, there would be many Command Performances at Windsor Castle, culminating in 1941 when Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose starred in their own production of Cinderella, with the band of the Royal Horse Guards providing music. Panto in the 19th century soon belonged with ‘cards and carols, turkey and plum pudding, presents and family gatherings’ in the pantheon of a traditional Christmas. Dickens was besotted by the ‘poetry, the lights, the music, the smooth, stupendous changes of glittering and brilliant scenery’. There was much boisterous physical action deriving from the circus — brutal horseplay based on Punch and Judy puppets battering wives and beating babies. Joseph Grimaldi made fun of binge-drinking, gambling and knavery, ‘holding authority up to ridicule’ by picking pockets, or pilfering legs of mutton. Audiences grew hysterical if a policeman had his helmet knocked over his eyes — Chaplin perpetuated all this in his silent movies, and the anarchic links with music hall were to continue with the Goons, the Pythons and the Carry On team. I agree with Richards that a clown’s jokes are based on cruelty. I always much prefer the comic dame, a role played by male actors since Regency times. The performer is clearly a man dressed as an absurd and ugly woman. Les Dawson was a genius as Widow Twankey; today’s maestro is former Coronation Street actor Eric Potts, whose mountainous Sarah the Cook appears this year at the Bristol Hippodrome, co-starring with Britain’s Got Talent winners Ashleigh and Pudsey. Opposite the dame was always the Principal Boy, played by a lissom lass, ‘ample-bosomed, small-waisted and with thighs — oh, such thighs! — thighs that shone and glittered in different-coloured tights’. Steady on, professor! The Queen was always the Principal Boy in Windsor. But even as an impressionable child, I remember Anita Harris smacking her own rounded limbs with a riding crop and lamenting that she was already 50 miles from London and still there’d been ‘no sign of Dick’ — Dick Whittington, she meant. Bawdy innuendo was essential and, in Victorian days, as today (unless the politically-correct patrol have put a stop to it), everyone liked to see the chorus high-kicking and displaying ‘amber silk drawers’ or Union Jack knickers. Plots have always been based on classical myths, fairytales and legends: Robinson Crusoe, Aladdin and Dick Whittington have long been favourites, allowing ample scope for such stock characters as abominable uncles, misers, barons or bailiffs, wicked stepmothers, bankrupt widows, plus wholesome heroes and princes, who embark on quests or are set tests, winning through by using their wits and strength. Pantomime always revolved around slapstick, gender role reversal and topical allusion . They also utilise supernatural aid, represented by the genie of the lamp or a fairy godmother, roles taken today by the likes of Britt Ekland or Barbara Windsor. Indeed, TV veterans and movie has-beens often tread the boards at Christmas. Jerry Hall is a Wicked Witch in Richmond this season; David Hasselhoff is usually at large somewhere as Captain Hook. I once saw the elderly Anna Neagle waving a wand. As a child, I saw Bernard Bresslaw and Victor Spinetti giving their Abanazars, whipping up a storm of booing from the audience. I met the latter years later and told him he was a bigger ham than Laurence Olivier. Spinetti told me that when Olivier dressed up as Father Christmas for a National Theatre party, the tots present screamed with terror — Olivier played Santa as Richard III. Playing Widow Twankey in a pantomime has been a priority for many performers . The Victorians also mastered stage illusion, utilising magic lanterns, kaleidoscopes, gaslight and stained glass to create ‘elaborate mechanical effects’. Cinderella’s coach, complete with Shetland ponies, was always a set-piece, as was Aladdin’s treasure-cave. What audiences particularly applauded were the transformation scenes, when ‘the glitter of tinselled pasteboard’ turned swamps or the murk of London, before the spectators’ very eyes, into paradise gardens: ‘vistas of flowers and tall, crystal columns ranged in avenues’. This happens today — I’ve known Buttons and Prince Charming nip backstage for a fag break, so that the audience can don 3D specs and watch computerised sea-monsters swimming around in front of their faces. Pantos also utilise supernatural aid, represented by the genie of the lamp or a fairy godmother, roles taken today by the likes of Barbara Windsor . In the century before foreign travel, what panto provided on stage was a vision of abroad — fantasy foreign realms, ‘all the gorgeousness of the East’, which was fast becoming part of Victoria’s Empire. It didn’t come cheap. A Christmas panto might cost £6,000 (£680,000 in today’s money) to mount, though profits of £25,000 (£4.5 million today) could accrue. Eight hundred people were involved, on stage or behind the scenes, particularly troupes of children, dozens in each show, dancing and playing pixies, elves, squirrels, or monkeys. Incredible as it may sound, Richards says an estimated 10,000 children were employed during the pantomime season in London and up and down the country. Until Acts of Parliament in 1879, no particular thought was given to their welfare. Such moppets were never educated — indeed, they were maltreated, and the reformer Lord Shaftesbury thundered against the plight of ‘pantomime waifs’, who suffered ‘physically and morally for no purpose other than to administer to the pernicious amusement of the populace’. I’m old enough to remember celebrity dwarves and midgets like Wee Georgie Wood and Jimmy Clitheroe. I found them dead creepy, actually, yet in typically fascinating detail, Richards says the character of Tom Thumb was a Victorian hero, rather than outcast. Competitive auditions were fierce. The character would be obliged to fall in a honey pot, be carried off in a bag of gold, be devoured and disgorged by a cow, carried into the air by a crow, swallowed by a giant, found in a salmon, drowned in a punch-bowl, and ended up ‘at King Arthur’s court riding on a mouse.’ Beat that, Ashleigh and Pudsey.","Deliberately uncool, pantomime expresses our nutty national temperament .

"British police have been asked to conduct their own independent DNA tests as the Thai investigations into the murders of two Britons plunged into disarray today. Lawyers for two Burmese men arrested for the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller asked Thailand's National Human Rights Commission to press British police to help with the case. The new development came as the Burmese lawyers said the men, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, had retracted their earlier confessions. Scroll down for video . Fitted up? Burmese suspects Zaw Lin (left) and Win Zaw Htun (right), both 21,during a televised reconstruction of the crime. Their lawyers want British police to conduct independent DNA tests . Thai prosecutors have also said the 300 page dossier presented to them by police had holes in it and further evidence was required. The National Human Rights Commission has also decided to send a team to Koh Tao to examine the crime scene, The Nation newspaper reported today. Thai police have come under intense criticism locally and internationally for the way they have handled the case since the bodies of the two Britons were found on Koh Tao's Sairee Beach on the morning of September 15. They failed to seal off the crime scene and issued a number of conflicting statements before announcing that the two Burmese men had been arrested. But the bar workers claimed later that their 'confessions' had been forced from them under duress. They said the bruises on their bodies proved they had been beaten by police. Detectives denied this and said DNA evidence matching samples from the body of Miss Witheridge and the two men was evidence of their guilt. Prosecutors, however, said the evidence was still not strong enough to take the men to court and they have asked police to re-submit their file on the case after adding evidence that was required to make it watertight. The bodies of Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found on  a beach on the island of Koh Tao . Suicide risk: The chief of Koh Samui prison says he's asked other inmates to keep an eye on the suspects . The insistence that more evidence was required has now prompted the men's lawyers to ask for an independent examination of the DNA evidence. The lawyers have called on both the Human Rights Commission as well as the Myanmar (Burmese) Embassy in Thailand to make approaches to Scotland Yard and ask for a forensic team to look at the DNA evidence. In a sign of the distress the suspects are suffering, the chief of the prison where the two men are being held says they are being monitored to prevent any possible suicide attempts. Chanin Liangsuwan, chief of Koh Samui District Prison, said: 'I have instructed other inmates to monitor the two Burmese men. I am afraid they may commit suicide, because they show signs of stress. 'They may be feeling guilty for the crime they have done.' Thaivisa.com quoted Mr Chanin as saying the pair are being held in a general holding cell with other inmates, but that wardens were still doing their best to keep an eye on them. Witthaya Suriyawong, director of the Department of Corrections, explaining he had warned prison officials to be wary, added: 'They are a special case because they are charged with a serious crime, which carries a high penalty. 'Even the food they eat has to be checked thoroughly to prevent any incident. I also want officials to set up CCTVs and guards to monitor their safety when they sleep.' Regional Public Prosecutor Thawatchai Siangiaew said today that once the amended police report, with the added requested evidence, had been submitted, a decision would be made within seven days on when the men would be brought before a court.","Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, retracted their earlier confessions .

Dog lovers have always known it, but now science seems to be lending weight to the idea that our canine best friends emphasise with us when we are sad. In fact, research published this month in the journal Animal Cognition suggests that that dogs may respond more to our emotions than anyone other species - and that includes other humans. They will approach strangers in distress to comfort them, regardless of expectation of reward or care. The research by Goldsmiths University doctors concluded that dogs nuzzle and lick humans they think are in distress - behaving in a submissive manner designed to offer comfort. Dr Deborah Custance and Jennifer Mayer, both from the Department of Psychology, developed a test to examine if domestic dogs could identify and respond to emotional states in humans. Eighteen pet dogs, spanning a range of ages and breeds, were exposed to four separate 20-second experimental conditions in which either the dog's owner or an unfamiliar person pretended to cry, hummed in an odd manner, or carried out a casual conversation. Significantly more dogs looked at, . approached and touched the humans as they were crying as opposed to . humming, and no dogs responded during talking. The majority of dogs in the study . responded to the crying person in a submissive manner consistent with . empathic concern and comfort-offering. Dr Deborah Custance of Goldsmiths, University of London, said: 'The humming was designed to be a . relatively novel behaviour, which might be likely to pique the dogs' curiosity. 'The fact that the dogs differentiated between crying and . humming indicates that their response to crying was not purely driven by . curiosity. ‘Rather, the crying carried greater . emotional meaning for the dogs and provoked a stronger overall response . than either humming or talking.’ Sad eyes: Dogs will nuzzle and console us when we are down, perhaps following years of evolution alongside Man . The study also found that the dogs . responded to the person who was crying regardless of whether it was . their owner or the unfamiliar person. ‘If the dog's approaches during the . crying condition were motivated by self-oriented comfort-seeking, they . would be more likely to approach their usual source of comfort, their . owner, rather than the stranger,’ said Jennifer. ‘No such preference was found. The . dogs approached whoever was crying regardless of their identity. Thus . they were responding to the person's emotion, not their own needs, which . is suggestive of empathic-like comfort-offering behaviour.’ Custance told Discovery News: 'We have domesticated dogs over a long period of time. We have selectively bred them to act as our companions. 'Thus those dogs that responded sensitively to our . emotional cues may have been the individuals that we would be more . likely to keep as pets and breed from.'","Study at Goldsmiths University shows dogs will spot crying people and approach and nuzzle .

Even strangers get the same level of concern as a dog's owner ."
"A couple had some unexpected wedding crashers this weekend when their big day was over run by Occupy protesters. Thousands were expected to march in downtown Chicago today to the lakeside McCormick Place convention center where President Obama and dozens of other world leaders will meet for the Nato summit. Newlyweds Tim and Beth Alberts left the church in the city centre on Saturday after exchanging their vows and found themselves in the middle of a mass demonstration. Scroll down for video .

Both Chicago residents, Mr Alberts is a law clerk at Brady, Connolly & Masuda and Mrs Alberts is a medical aesthetician at Cellular Intelligence Med Spa. Hundreds of protestors paid little heed to the newlyweds on their march through the city. The anti-NATO protests were also aimed at Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's budget cuts. There were high tensions and frequent clashes between protesters and police today as violence broke out in pockets around the city.

Police in riot gear surrounded the downtown areas of Grant Park and the Loop and also patrolled train stations. Protesters began arriving at 6.30 am at the park and set up under the trees to shade themselves from the sun. The hacking group Anonymous said it had attacked the websites of the city of Chicago and police department because of a violation of human rights. Officials said they were still investigating how the sites went down in a possible cyber attack. The sites shut down this morning. In one Anonymous tweet, the group claimed to have taken the police site out of commission as the Nato summit began in the city today. All sites were now back up and running. Following the rally in the park, protesters planned to march to the convention center at McCormick Place. Around the Nato summit, concrete barriers have been set up along with black, anti-scale fencing. Some businesses and homes in the area have taken the precaution of boarding up their windows. Chris Geovanis of the Chicago and New Media Collective told the thousands gathered in the park that police had interfere with the march and hurt some protesters, according to the Chicago Tribune. The Reverend Jesse Jackson also appeared and said the protests must remain non-violent. He said: 'We learned from Dr. King in Birmingham. We march in a disciplined, non-violent way. We cannot afford to have our message hijacked by acts of provocation.' There have been 18 arrested over the past week - not including the five people arrested on suspicion of two separate terrorist plots to use Molotov cocktails during the summit. What to do?

Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai met this morning at the opening of the Nato summit to discuss Afghanistan's 2014 elections, as well as the prospect of a political settlement with the Taliban. The crowds were in the hundreds on Saturday, down from an estimated 2,500 people on Friday at Daley Plaza - named after Mayor Richard J. Daley, who headed the city during bloody clashes between police and anti-Vietnam War protesters at the 1968 Democratic convention. Chicago police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said late last night that there had been 18 arrests during the week. One protester was taken to a hospital after a group of people swarmed on a police vehicle and slashed a tire, he added. Local media showed video of the man in front of the vehicle trying to stop it but it was unclear if he was run over. Another protester spray-painted an 'A' for anarchy on the door of a Verizon Wireless store. Discussions: Obama meets with Afghan president Hamid Karzai this morning at the Nato summit in Chicago . Saturday's marches began early, with an estimated 500 people protesting outside Mayor Rahm Emanuel's home to criticise cuts in city mental health services. Mr McCarthy said protesters were 'making noise and disrupting some people's lives,' but that overall, events were going well. President Obama and First Lady Michelle were greeted on their arrival to Chicago last night by Emanuel, his former chief of staff, and his wife Amy Rule  on the tarmac at O'Hare International Airport. Earlier Obama had wound up talks with fellow members of the G8 regarding the eurozone financial crisis and attempts to keep Greece in the Euro.

The city of Chicago had not granted a permit for Saturday's protests but police allowed several groups of protesters to wander around the city guided by officers mostly on bicycles. There was some pushing and shoving between police and protesters but no major clashes. Saturday's protests followed the announcement that three men arrested earlier in the week had been charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism. Prosecutors said the three self-described anarchists were planning to attack President Barack Obama's Chicago campaign headquarters and Emanuel's home.

Saturday's protests stressed economic and social policy issues rather than international questions, such as the war in Afghanistan, expected to be discussed by world leaders at the NATO summit on Sunday and Monday. Three protest leaders said they met with Nato Ambassador Kolinda Grabar of the military alliance's public diplomacy unit . 'My message to Ambassador Grabar was that we are very aware of the immense violence and oppression that the U.S. in its Nato guise does to the world, and that no amount of words from her or pronouncements from the summit itself will obscure that,' said Andy Thayer, one of the protest leaders . Many of the protesters were from the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in New York last autumn to protest policies that lead to income inequality. The group says 1 per cent of the U.S. population holds too much of the nation's wealth.

"The High Street decorations are up, the window displays are sparkling and festive Muzak is blaring out of almost every shop door. With less than a month to go, this is the week when Christmas shopping begins in earnest for millions of bargain-hunting Britons. And, this year, supermarket shelves seem to be overloaded with half-price Christmas offers like never before. Waitrose shoppers have been snapping up 50 per cent off Christmas biscuits all week. You can pick up half-price coffee machines at Sainsbury’s, half-price Irish cream at Morrisons and half-price Cadbury’s Christmas Milk Tray at the Co-op. And at Tesco the aisles have been groaning under the weight of half-price Nivea, L’Oreal and Baylis & Harding toiletries gift sets. Many Christmas products put on the shelves at the end of the summer have been reduced to half price this month - just in time for Christmas shoppers . At Asda, shoppers are bombarded with promotions for deals on Barbie dolls, Lego trucks and Peppa Pig play sets. But while the deals look fantastic, shoppers looking for a recession-busting Christmas might want to pause before filling their trolleys. For when it comes to surviving the festive season there are two golden rules: never drink on an empty stomach, and never shop on an empty head. Half price doesn’t always mean half price. And when it comes to ripping us off at Christmas, no one does it quite like the supermarkets. So what exactly does ‘half price’ really mean — and how can shoppers avoid the dodgy deals? Bogus supermarket offers were supposed to have been outlawed last year when all but one of the major supermarkets signed up to new voluntary guidelines from the Office of Fair Trading (Asda said it simply wanted more time to consider the code). The rules say prices must not be ‘artificially manipulated’ to make future discounts more attractive. That means shops can’t inflate prices simply to slash them a few weeks later and claim the product is at half price. Shops are not supposed to have goods on a sale price longer than they were at the full price. And they are not supposed to set higher prices when goods are out of season — only to lower them in time for the expected seasonal rush. While supermarkets insist they follow the rules, some appear to be sailing very close to the wind. Christmas bargains: The Office of Fair Trading rules mean that supermarkets must not 'artificially manipulate' prices to make future discounts seem more appealing . It’s long been a source of bewilderment to shoppers why Christmas chocolates and toys start appearing in stores in September. But there’s a very good reason. Extending the Christmas season back to the end of summer allows retailers to indulge in some crafty — but perfectly lawful — ‘discounting’ in November, when the festive shopping season really takes off. Waitrose started to sell a Thorntons chocolate snowman on August 26, priced £8 for each 250g figure. That’s an eye-watering price for chocolates and it’s a time of year when most parents are thinking about new school shoes, not stocking fillers. But after two months, the price of the Snowman chocolates was halved to a more reasonable £4 on November  5 — and up went the ‘half-price’ labels promoting another apparently fabulous bargain. And because Waitrose had them on sale at full price for so long — all the way through September and October — it is allowed to promote the chocolate figures as ‘half price’ all the way to Christmas Eve. Harrassed parents, looking for a quick stocking filler during the weekly shop, won’t have time to consider whether £4 is such a bargain. They’ll see the half-price label, grab it then head for the  frozen peas. Waitrose did it with its Christmas chocolate biscuits, too. They went  on sale for £6 at the end of August before their price was dropped by half in November. It could be argued that selling Christmas chocolate and biscuits in August at full price — only to slash them in November — is not in the spirit of the OFT rules. But the guidelines are vague about what counts as ‘in season’ and ‘out of season’. Supermarkets argue that the end of August is the start of the Christmas period in the shops and they are doing nothing dodgy. It’s difficult to prove that . supermarkets inflate prices out of season, before cutting them to boost . sales in the run up to Christmas. And all, naturally, insist that their . pricing is honest and transparent. Festive shopping: It could be argued that these half price deals are not in the spirit of the OFT rules . But one only needs to visit the wine and spirits section of the local supermarket to see the full extent of ‘yo-yoing’ Christmas price offers. Six out of ten wine bottles sold in supermarkets are on special offer. It’s virtually impossible to visit a store without stumbling across a fantastic looking half-price deal. In Tesco this week it’s the turn of Australian Rawnsley Estate Cabernet Merlot — reduced from £10.99 to an impressive £5.49. Wine lovers will tell you that, for £5.49, it’s a perfectly decent bottle of plonk for a Christmas party and reasonably good value. But is it really an  £11 bottle? You don’t need to be a wine buff to know that £11 can get you a really good bottle — including some award-winning wines. Rawnsley Estate Cabernet Merlot is not one of them. What it seems to be is a classic example of a ‘yo-yo’ price promotion. According to the website Mysupermarket, Tesco had it on ‘half price’ through most of January and the first ten days of February. It was back at half price for 11 days in March, for four weeks in April and May, and for another four weeks over the summer. It reappeared as a half-price bargain on November 13 ready for the start of the Christmas party season. So far this year it’s been sold at half price for nearly four months out of 11. And while Tesco insists it is not in breach of any rules, it looks suspiciously like a product designed to spend two thirds of the year at an inflated price. In reality, that’s not a bargain. It’s a marketing trick. And other shops do the same. Earlier this month, the BBC’s Watchdog programme showed that most supermarkets use the same  yo-yo technique. Comparison: Shoppers can use websites such as Mysupermarket to check the prices of products throughout the year . Sainsbury’s Piccini Chianti Riserva supposedly costs £11.99 at full price — and when it drops to £5.99, it’s promoted as a half-price bargain. Watchdog found out that it spent 43 per cent of  the time as a  £5.99 wine. And it’s not just wines that yo-yo in price. The Co-op is promoting  ‘half-price’ Cadbury’s Milk Tray for £3.99 this month. Last month the same box cost £8. At the end of August and start of September it was back down to £4. Tesco has been heavily promoting its half-price Christmas toiletries gift sets. They appeared in shops at the start of September as part of a three-for-two offer, went up to full price in October, and were at half price from the start of the month to the weekend just gone. Technically, the store is following the OFT rules. But effectively the gift sets have been on discount for more than half their time on supermarket shelves. So how can we shoppers avoid the half-price rip-off? Shopping around certainly helps get a sense of when bargains are real and when they are inflated. And online databases such as Mysupermarket can help show the real prices over a year — not just the inflated prices before the discount. All the supermarkets insist they are doing nothing wrong. A spokesman for the Co-op said its Christmas pudding was launched in August to allow people to ‘spread the cost of the festive season’ and went on promotion in October when demand rises  ‘as more people’s thoughts turn to Christmas’. Waitrose said its promotions ‘will have been on full sale price in the same shop for the full period stated’. And it added that its price tickets were ‘very clear’. One thing is clear — supermarkets need to be more transparent, putting information on the shelves saying when and where goods were last at full price, and shoppers need to be more cynical about ‘half-price’ festive offers. There’s one old adage that is never truer than at Christmas. When something seems too good to be true, it usually is.","Office of Fair Trading rules say prices must not be 'artificially manipulated' by shops to make future discounts more attractive .

"At the age of four, he's already been made a member of Mensa and achieved fame for his intellect. But that wasn't enough for Sherwyn Sarabi, who is now being compared to Albert Einstein, Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking after recording an IQ score of 160. The psychologist who tested Sherwyn, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said his score - the highest possible on the Wechsler Scale - showed he has a 'very superior level of intelligence'. Scroll down for video . Sherwyn Sarabi, four, has achieved an IQ score of 160 - the highest possible mark on the Whechsler Scale . His IQ score is the latest in a long line of grand achievements by Sherwyn, who joined Mensa when he was three years old. He spoke his first words at ten months, was talking in full sentences at 20 months, and has been wowing his parents, teachers and doctors ever since. Ten months: At less than one year old, Sherwyn spoke his first word . 20 months: Ten months later, he was speaking in sentences . Two years: Sherwyn shoots to fame after learning to identify every country in the world. The toddler can also read up to 500 words, describe all major body organs and their functions, count to 200, identify shapes and explain volcanoes and shooting stars . Three years: Is made a member of Mensa and starts going to school . Four years: Sherwyn records an IQ score of 160, putting him on a par with Albert Einstein, Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking. Now, Sherwyn has a mental age of eight years and nine months - more than twice his actual age - and is studying at that level. Educational psychologist Dr Peter Congdon said: ‘Sherwyn has a very superior level of intelligence, he is incredibly gifted and his vocabulary is out of this world. ‘His intellect reaches the highest possible levels of reason and when he talks to you he has the social skills of a much older child.' He added: ‘It is very unusual for a child to have this type of intelligence, he came out at the very top on the tests. ‘I specialise in specially gifted children but when I tested Sherwyn I knew I had come across something very special.’ While most four-year-olds have not yet . started school, Sherwyn is already studying work for eight and . nine-year-olds at Rastrick Independent School, Huddersfield. The psychologist who tested Sherwyn said has a 'very superior level of intelligence' Sherwyn’s mother, Amanda Sarabi, 37, a former teacher, said: ‘He is a very happy healthy child and loves to talk. ‘He questions everything and I have been doing my best to answer his questions to the best of my knowledge.' She added: ‘His general knowledge is amazing for a four-year-old - I think it’s because of all the questions he asks all day long.' Sherwyn, who is an only child, has read more than 940 books and, according to his mother, 'his favourite is the encyclopaedia as he loves learning new things.’ Mrs Sarabi, a former teacher, has given up . work to care for her construction worker husband, Daroud, 37, as he recovers from a . serious car accident.

"The BBC has been accused of celebrating drugs culture in its news reports about the launch of a Bob Marley cannabis company. The heirs of the Jamaican reggae singer have sparked outrage by launching what they describe as the ‘world’s first global cannabis brand’. Critics say the artist’s fame and image will only encourage young people to abuse the drug. Marijuana king: The BBC has been accused of celebrating drugs culture in its news reports about the launch of a Bob Marley cannabis company . They also point out that the weed he smoked in the 1960s and 70s was much safer than modern skunk. But instead of questioning the move in its news reports, the corporation aired a light-hearted, uncritical report that even its own reporter jokingly described as a ‘puff piece’. David Raynes, of the National Drugs Prevention Alliance, said the BBC’s handing of the topic was irresponsible. ‘As a public service broadcaster it has a duty to be fair and balanced,’ he said. ‘This is not a straightforward issue and they should have presented both sides of the story. 'People will be harmed because of the Marley cannabis brand. ‘Some young people may be permanently damaged. ' And some may be encouraged to take the drug because of this irresponsible reporting.’ Partnership: Rita Marley, the late singer's wife, is said to have initiated Marley Natural by contacting private equity firm Privateer Holdings and suggesting a partnership . Couple: Jamaican singer-songwriter Bob Marley and his wife Rita Marley on July 26, 1978 . Radio 4’s Today programme devoted five minutes to the news of the Marley business venture yesterday, filling the segment with reggae music and clips of the singer’s children advocating cannabis use. Business reporter Simon Jack interviewed Brendan Kennedy, the American investor who has paired up with the Marley estate to sell strains of marijuana, weed-infused lotions, creams and accessories. Under the brand name Marley Natural, the products will initially be sold in American states that have legalised cannabis use. Marley, who died of cancer in May 1981, embraced cannabis as part of his Rastafarian faith and supported legalisation. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Today has an intelligent adult audience who would appreciate that this was a light-hearted business item, which did not relate to the supply of cannabis inside the UK. It was made clear that cannabis is illegal in the UK.’","Family of late singer Bob Marley have launched a high-end cannabis brand .

"Michael Shrimpton, 57, (pictured) sparked a security scare when he claimed spies were plotting to bomb the Queen  during the 2012 London Olympics . A barrister who sparked a security scare when he claimed German spies were plotting to assassinate the Queen with a nuclear weapon during the 2012 London Olympics has denied he is a ‘fantasist, nutter or liar’. Michael Shrimpton, 57, allegedly called the House of Commons and the Aylesbury Conservative Association to warn them that a bomb stolen from a sunken Russian submarine had been smuggled into the country and was stashed in an east London hospital. The lawyer, who had a ‘fascination’ for political and military intelligence, told a close colleague of former Defence Secretary Philip Hammond that the deadly weapon would be detonated during the 2012 Olympics, Southwark Crown Court heard. He also bombarded the offices of MP David Lidington with voicemails to repeat his bomb hoax, the jury heard. Appearing at court today, Shrimpton, of Wendover, Buckinghamshire, insisted he was not a compulsive liar and said he was giving a ‘reasoned intelligence briefing from an intelligence specialist’. ‘The idea I was acting in bad faith didn’t occur to me... I thought I was doing something sensible,’ he said. Shrimpton said he was ‘genuinely concerned’ for the safety of the Games and the Queen ‘for whom I hold deep affection’. The lawyer denies communicating false information and is representing himself at his trial. Today, prosecutor Alan Blake asked him: ‘Do you accept lots of people claim to be involved in intelligence but aren’t and lots of them can be fantasists, nutters or liars?’ To which Shrimpton replied: 'Yes'. Mr Blake continued: ‘Because mostly when lawyers are dealing with people who claim to have an intelligence connection, normally it is people making things up? To which Shrimpton replied 'yes' again before adding: ‘I can’t recall when I said them but they are my words.' The practicing barrister, who has also sat as an immigration judge, later insisted: ‘I tell the truth’. And he insisted he was not a ‘nutter’, telling jurors he had never suffered from mental health problems and had never been referred to a psychiatrist. When Mr Blake asked Shrimpton if he was solely responsible for his actions, he replied: ‘Yes. I am the maker of my fate and the captain of my soul.’ Shrimpton, who describes himself as a 'major player', claims to be well connected in international intelligence and defence organisations. He denied he was a compulsive liar and stressed there was ‘absolutely no point trying to pass duff intelligence’ as it would damage his reputation in the ‘glamourous, exciting area’. Shrimpton also told the court that he formerly worked on the investigation into Madeleine McCann’s disappearance and the case of former Chilean president Augusto Pinochet. The barrister told a close colleague of former Defence Secretary Philip Hammond that the deadly weapon, taken from a Russian submarine, would be detonated during the 2012 Games, Southwark Crown Court heard . He read extracts from his address book with a number of ‘contacts’ in the CIA, FBI, MI6, the Pentagon, Chinese intelligence and Parliament. Shrimpton said: ‘I admit that the stuff I deal with is bound to sound strange, highfalutin, incredible and fantastic. ‘It’s my world, welcome to my world.’ Shrimpton also claims he has previously rubbed shoulders with royalty, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and he listed a number of famous names including Richard Branson and Steven Forbes. He boasted about possessing the name and number of the private secretary of His Royal Highness Prince Phillip who he said he has met twice in a social context. Shrimpton also claims he has travelled the world on intelligence assignments and carried a gun into America with permission from the CIA. He also claims to have the authority to issue a Defence Advisory Notice on behalf of the Government to stop British media from publishing stories that could compromise national security. He said he wanted to prevent the News of the World from blowing his intelligence, and added they were ‘very cooperative’. Shrimpton also told the jury that there was an assassination attempt against him by the Chinese authorities who wanted to ‘whack’ him. Jurors heard how Shrimpton reported that the deadly weapon was going to be used against the Queen, the main stadium or the opening ceremony during the 2012 Olympics. He denied he was a compulsive liar today . He claimed the Los Angeles Sheriff Department also consulted him on possible terror attacks over a cup of coffee. Jurors heard he passed information about an imminent attack in London to people in high authority when the preparation for the 2012 games was at an ‘advanced stage’. Shrimpton announced that a nuclear weapon stolen from the sunken Russian submarine, the Kursk, had been smuggled into the UK and was being stored in an east London hospital, it was said. He first dialled the House of Commons on April 19 and received a call back from Barry Burton who was the principal private secretary to Philip Hammond. Shrimpton boasted of ‘credible European sources’, name-dropped MPs and said intelligence had been blocked through official channels. During the 20-minute call with Mr Burton, Shrimpton said he was a lawyer with information about four nuclear warheads that had been removed from a submarine. One warhead was being held in a hospital to mask its radioactive signals and was going to be used to attack the Olympic Games. The weapon was going to be used against the Queen, the main stadium or the opening ceremony, jurors heard. Shrimpton denies communicating false information and is representing himself at Southwark Crown Court . Mr Burton was forced to pass the information to the Olympic security team and the police, despite his suspicions that it was a hoax, it was said. The next day, Shrimpton rang the Aylesbury Conservative Association and spoke to Sarah Sproat. He told her he needed to get a message to the MP David Lidington about a nuclear warhead which she then reported to a colleague at parliament, the court heard. Shrimpton was arrested on suspicion of communicating false information the same day. He previously admitted leaving the voicemail at the House of Commons but denied making positive statements about a nuclear threat, jurors heard. Shrimpton claimed the Deutsches Verteidigungs Dienst (DVD) - a reference to ‘a covert and rather sinister’ German agency -had penetrated MI5, MI6 and GHQ. He allegedly claimed the DVD was responsible for sabotaging the Kursk in 2000 and stealing the nuclear weapons. The information had initially come from the Russian intelligence agency the GRU, jurors heard. Shrimpton has been a member of the Aylesbury Conservative Association since he defected from the Labour party in 1997. He denies two counts of communicating false information with intent. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Michael Shrimpton claimed bomb had been smuggled into London hospital .

"The case of Felix Garcia - a deaf man serving a life sentence for a murder he says his brother framed him for - took an unexpected turn this week when a third brother arrived in court to say both his siblings are guilty. Garcia's supporters insist he did not receive a fair trial in the 1981 murder-robbery of Joseph Tramontana, Jr. in Tampa, Florida, for which both he and his brother Frank are imprisoned. At a parole hearing yesterday, the board decided to move up Felix Garcia's potential parole date by one year, to 2025. He will get another hearing in three years. Felix Garcia (left) claims he was framed for the 1981 murder by his brother Frank Garcia (right) Both are currently serving long sentences . They did not move up the date for brother Frank Garcia, who is serving a 99-year sentence with a potential 2026 release date. His case will be reheard in seven years. The third brother, Mike Garcia, and sister Tina Daniels spoke at the hearing only in the proceeding for Frank Garcia. 'You know your family members - when they're telling the truth and when they're not telling you the truth,' Mike Garcia said. 'People can bull crap, I understand that. People are con artists, I understand that. I know my brother Frank. I know my brother Felix. I know Francisco Garcia did not pull that trigger.' Attorneys Reginald Garcia (left) and Pat Bliss - who has fought 18-years on Felix' behalf - speak to the Florida Commission on Offender Review on behave of Felix Garcia  in Tallahassee . A commission member asked if that meant Felix participated. 'Yes. Yes, they were both there at that time,' Mike Garcia answered. After the hearing, he told reporters that he believed Felix is the person who killed Tramontana Jr. Felix Garcia's supporters insist he did not receive a fair trial in the 1981 murder-robbery . 'That's what I've heard over the years. I wasn't there,' he said. 'I know my brothers, and that's it. ' Mike Garcia's account is a vastly different story than lawyers presented. They said Felix Garcia had two witnesses placing him six miles away from the motel where the murder happened. The lawyers insist Frank Garcia, his sister, Tina, and her boyfriend, Ray Stanley participated in the crime and framed Felix. They say Frank Garcia gave Felix the victim's ring to sell, and the pawn shop slip tied him to the crime. Neither the sister nor Stanley was charged, and Stanley has since died. Frank Garcia later admitted Felix wasn't involved in the murder, the lawyers also said. Although Felix Garcia was given a hearing aid, and a courtroom speaker was turned up,  lawyers say he still could not understand the proceedings at the murder trial. 'He is totally innocent,' lawyer Reggie Garcia, who isn't related to the brothers, said. 'Felix Garcia has an alibi before, during and after the murder.' Prosecuting attorney Mark Ober speaks to the Florida Commission on Offender Review concerning Garcia . But prosecutor Mark Ober said the affidavit Frank Garcia signed on behalf of Felix was part of a plot to get his brother out so he could sue the state and then help seek Frank's release. After the hearing, Pat Bliss - an attorney who has fought for 18 years on Felix' behalf - approached his siblings and said she was shocked they did not speak for him, too. 'He never asked us,' Ms Daniels said. 'He feels like he's been deserted by his family,' Ms Bliss responded.

"One of Britain’s biggest banks has been fined £56million for an IT glitch which locked millions of customers out of the bank accounts - equivalent to £8.60 for every affected customer. The record penalty on Royal Bank of Scotland has been levied by City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority, which imposed a £42million fine, and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, which fined the lender £14million. Some 6.5million  customers of RBS, NatWest and Irish subsidiary Ulster Bank endured a week of chaos in June 2012 when a software upgrade went spectacularly wrong. RBS has been fined £56million for an IT glitch which locked millions of customers out of the bank accounts. Millions of customers of RBS, NatWest and Irish subsidiary Ulster Bank endured a week of chaos in June 2012 when a software upgrade went spectacularly wrong . The ensuing IT meltdown left customers unable to make or receive payments, with many hit with hefty charges for breaching their overdraft limits and not receiving their wages. The scandal has already landed RBS with a £175million bill to compensate customers and pay overtime to staff as the bank was forced to extend opening hours at branches to sort out the mess. Former chief executive Stephen Hester forfeited his bonus of up to £2.4million over the fiasco at a bank which is still 81 per cent owned by the taxpayer. The fine – which is the biggest ever for an IT failure – comes just days after RBS was one of six banks fined £2.6billion for rigging the £3trillion a day foreign exchange market. RBS was hit with a £400million penalty by UK and US regulators, with regulators publishing damning transcripts of its traders bragging about the conspiracy. The IT failure has raised concerns about the state backed lender’s creaking computer systems which have continued to let down customers in recent years. Former chief executive Stephen Hester forfeited his bonus of up to £2.4million over the fiasco at a bank which is still 81pc owned by the taxpayer . RBS suffered another systems outage in December on the busiest online shopping day of the year, the third time in about 18 months that such a problem had prevented customers from using cards, cash machines and online banking services. RBS bosses admitted previously they had failed to invest enough in their IT systems for decades, following a computer meltdown that hit millions of customers. The extraordinary admission a after a string of glitches where millions of  debit card cash withdrawals and purchases, some credit card transactions, plus online banking and banking via mobile phone, were blocked. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said the most recent systems failure was ‘unacceptable’, and admitted: ‘For decades, RBS failed to invest properly in its systems. We know we have to do better.’ In 2012 a junior technician in India was blamed for causing the RBS computer meltdown which froze millions of British bank accounts. But it later emerged it came from their Edinburgh headquarters. It says it has been ploughing billions of pounds into bolstering its IT systems to help ensure that similar problems do not reoccur. The lender recently pledged to invest an extra £1billion in its digital and IT services as it attempts to persuade more of its customers to bank online and on their mobile phones. But it has repeatedly denied reports that the problems in the summer of 2012 were caused by workers in the Indian city of Hyderabad, where it set up an IT support centre to cut costs. The results of its internal investigation into the source of the failure have yet to be published as it waits for the FCA’s verdict. Last night one expert suggested RBS has escaped lightly. David Buik from broker Panmure Gordon said: ‘Given the size of the trangression and the damage caused to customers this fine is nothing more than symbolic. We are talking about a bank which could not even get the basics right - stuff that affects people in their day to day life. It’s little wonder there is a complete lack of trust between banks and their customers.’ RBS declined to comment. Before the 2008 financial crisis, Royal Bank of Scotland was one of the largest and most aggressive banks in the world. The bank was founded in Edinburgh in 1727, but by the end of the 20th century it was a major player in the City of London too as the UK capital became the world's leading financial centre. RBS sealed its place at the top table of British banking in 2000 when it bought NatWest, which dates back to 1650 and was considered one of the 'Big Four' retail banks in the UK. Fred Goodwin, right, became chief executive of RBS the following year and pioneered a gung-ho expansion strategy with resources poured into its investment banking division. One of the biggest deals came when RBS joined a consortium to buy Dutch bank ABN Amro for £49billion, which was later revealed as a major overvaluation. With the advent of the 2007 credit crunch and subsequent global financial turmoil, RBS was exposed as being dangerously indebted and unable to meet its obligations. The Labour Government felt it had no option but to step in, and in October 2008 it took a 57 per cent stake in the bank in return for £37billion of new capital. As the bank's losses spiralled and it required even more bail-out money, the state share of the firm rose to 82 per cent. Much of the blame for RBS's troubles was attributed to Goodwin, who was forced to resign and subsequently stripped of the knighthood he had received in 2004.","The record penalty was levied by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority .

"A killer who shot dead a policeman and soldier before donning a burkha in a bid to evade police was beheaded in Saudi Arabia yesterday. Salih bin Yateem bin Salih al-Qarni was executed in the southwestern city of Abha, the official Saudi Press Agency said. Qarni was intially arrested on other charges and was transported in an official vehicle by the soldier and a member of the Muttawa religious police. Saudi women are required to cover up from head to toe, often with only their eyes exposed . 'He shot them with a gun that he was carrying,' the SPA said, without explaining how he obtained the weapon. After stealing the keys from the security officer driving the vehicle, Qarni chewed some narcotic qat 'and disguised himself in women's clothing' in an attempt to flee, but was recaptured, it said. Saudi women are required to cover from head to toe, often with only their eyes exposed. The report did not say when the escape bid occurred. Qarni is the latest of 69 Saudis and foreigners executed in the kingdom this year, despite international concern and condemnation for human rights groups. Rape, murder, apostasy, drug trafficking and armed robbery are all punishable by death under the kingdom's strict version of Islamic sharia law. Last year, Human Rights Watch's Nisha Varia told The Observer: 'The Saudi justice system is characterised by arbitrary arrests, unfair trials and harsh punishments.' Salih bin Yateem bin Salih al-Qarni was executed in the southwestern city of Abha, Saudi Arabia . Last week, a man who was convicted of smuggling heroin in his intestines became the seventh Pakistani beheaded for drug trafficking in Saudi Arabia in a month. Under the Saudi Sharia legal system it can actually be harder to avert execution for crimes without a specific victim, like drug smuggling, than for murder. Of the 59 people executed by mid-October, 22 had been convicted for smuggling drugs, according to figures compiled by Human Rights Watch from Saudi media reports. In Saudi Islamic law, charges of violent crimes like murder are usually brought under the system of 'qisas', which is retaliation on the principle of an eye for an eye. While a murderer would normally be sentenced to death, the victim's family is permitted to accept 'diyya', or blood money, instead of execution. The lives of women are worth half those of men, and non-Muslims a fraction of the value of Muslims. Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah announced plans for legal reform in 2007 but judges, have so far succeeded in putting off meaningful change . Convicts from less wealthy backgrounds, or without tribal connections, who might intercede with the family or tribe of the victim, are more likely to die because it is harder for them to arrange a blood money payment. One Saudi man, Mohammed Bakr al-Alaawi, was put to death for sorcery this year, the third such case since 2011. Although such cases are even rarer, judges can also demand execution for adulterers or Muslims who abandon their faith. Saudi Arabia has no civil penal code that sets out sentencing rules, and no system of judicial precedent that would make the outcome of cases predictable based on past practice. King Abdullah announced plans for legal reform in 2007, but judges, drawn from the traditionally conservative clergy, have so far succeeded in putting off meaningful change. His attempts to introduce more modern training for judges and a system of precedent to make sentencing more predictable have so far been blocked by strenuous opposition from conservatives. Even Saudis who want reform generally do not oppose the use of the death penalty by public beheading. Defenders of the Saudi death penalty say beheadings, usually with a single sword stroke, are at least as humane as lethal injections in the United States. They deplore any comparison between the kingdom's execution of convicted criminals and Islamic State's extra-judicial killing of innocent hostages. But rights activists say they are more concerned by the justice system behind the death penalty in the kingdom than by its particular method of execution. And critics of the Al Saud ruling family say the latest wave of executions may have a political message, with Riyadh determined to demonstrate its toughness at a moment of regional turmoil. Saudi Arabia beheaded 26 people in August, more than in the first seven months of the year combined. At the time, Madawi al-Rasheed, visiting professor at the Middle East Centre of the London School of Economics, said: 'It's possible the executions were used as intimidation and flexing of muscles. It's a very volatile time and executions do serve a purpose when they're done en masse. 'There's uncertainty around Saudi Arabia from the north and from the south and inside they are taking aggressive action alongside the U.S. against Islamic State, and all that is creating some kind of upheaval, which the death penalty tries to keep a lid on.'","Criminal was executed in the southwestern city of Abha yesterday .

"A Virginia high school administrator spoke out Thursday about her racially charged retweet that sparked a student protest this week and caused her to be placed on leave. Booker T. Washington High School Assistant Principal Amy Strickland released a statement to WAVY-TV saying that she is currently on leave after acknowledging that she retweeted an image that prompted a group of students to walk out of class Monday. Ms Strickland, a mother of two, responded Thursday to the uproar over a June post that had appeared on the satirical Twitter account ‘OrNahhTweets.’ 'Media reports suggesting that I am racially prejudiced are one thousand percent false, as my record and my many students, colleagues, friends, and family members who are African American can and, if necessary, will attest,' she stated. 'I deeply apologize to anyone I have inadvertently offended.' Breaking her silence: Assistant Principal Amy Strickland, left, released a statement Thursday acknowledging that she retweeted this image (right) from the account @OrNahhTweets, along with the caption: ‘every white girl's father's worst nightmare Or Nah' Viral image: Photo of seven interracial prom couples was retweeted by Strickland back in June, but it has gone viral only recently. The educator explained that she shared the picture with her daughter because the teen had had a black prom date herself . The image at the center of the controversy depicted seven couples in prom clothing, the boys black, the girls white, with the caption, ""Every white girl's father's worst nightmare Or Nah?"" Strickland told WAVY-TV through her lawyer that she forwarded the tweet to one of her daughters as a joke and never interpreted it as racist. Strickland noted that both of her daughters went to prom with black dates. 'The ""tweet"" appeared to me at the time to have been an attempt at good natured humor concerning mixed race couples attending a high school prom,' she wrote. 'I have devoted years of my life to educating students in a predominantly African American school and was named Teacher of the Year for the predominantly African American Portsmouth school system last year. 'Partly because of my exemplary record of working well and achieving success in an urban school system, I was hired this fall as Assistant Principal at Booker T. Washington.' Amy Strickland revealed also in her statement Thursday that she is currently on administrative leave. The educator pointed out through her attorney that she issued the statement as an individual, not as an employee of Booker T. Washington High School. The school administration reportedly has banned Strickland for talking to the press. The NAACP, which has launched an investigation into the matter, responded to Strickland's statement saying that the organization is not calling her racist, but they want to know what motivated her to retweet the picture. 'We hold the administration accountable for their actions. We will not tolerate racism in this city and definitely not in the education system,' stated NAACP President Joe Dillard. 'Booker T. Washington High School is a fragile school; and the last thing we need in our community are students walking out of school in protest to racist administrators.' On Monday, about a dozen students at Booker T. Washington High School in Norfolk staged a walk-out to draw attention to the racially charged message sent out by the white educator. 'I could have been any one of the boys in the picture,' Booker T Washington junior Michael LeMelle, who is African-American, told the station WAVY. 'And I really don’t see myself... as anyone’s worst nightmare.' For the past week, students at the school have been sharing among themselves screenshots of the incendiary tweet, which has since been deleted, along with Amy Strickland's account. Students said that they have appealed to the faculty last week to look into the retweet, but their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Norfolk School Board members told the news station Monday that they were unaware of the tweet until WAVY reached out to them for comment. Shakira Harris said that she and her classmates do not necessarily want Strickland fired, but they believe she deserves to be reprimanded for her poor judgement. ‘Do something to let us know it has not gone unnoticed,’ Harris pleaded. Video Source 13NewsNow.com . Troubled school: The Norfolk, Virginia, high school lost its accreditation last month over poor test scores and low graduation rates . Norfolk Federation of Teachers President Thomas Calhoun issued a statement Tuesday taking the school board and the Booker T Washington administration to task for allegedly dragging their feet. ‘Sometimes they seem to be hoping the problem will go away or maybe no one will notice,’ Calhoun wrote. ‘I feel everyone would be better served if they would address issues before the news media, the public, the staff, and the students get involved and form their own opinions of what is going on.’ According to her biography on Booker T Washington High School’s website, Amy Strickland, a graduate of Old Dominion University and Eastern Virginia Medical School, where she earned a Master's degree in public health, was hired as assistant principal earlier this year. After working in public health education for several years, Strickland switched gears in 2008 and became a science teacher and cheerleading couch in Portsmouth, where she led her team to 17 Eastern District and Conference titles. This year, she won three Teacher of The Year awards, including the overall citywide award for Portsmouth. The school, named after the legendary 19th century African-American community leader, educator and presidential adviser Booker T Washington, has more than 1,400 students enrolled in 9-12 grades, with 85 per cent of them black. Last month, Virginia's Board of Education stripped the high school of its accreditation because it has failed to meet state minimum scores on the Standards of Learning tests and graduation rates for the past four years.","Photo of seven interracial prom couples was retweeted by Booker T Washington High School Assistant Principal Amy Strickland back in June .

"'Anxious': Former Human Rights Commission chairman Trevor Phillips said the findings were 'not good news for integration' White Britons are 'retreating' from areas dominated by ethnic minorities, a study has revealed. Analysis of census figures shows that white Britons are leaving areas where they are in a minority and are being replaced by immigrants and other ethnic minorities. As a result, nearly half of ethnic minorities – 4 million people – live in communities where whites make up less than half the population, the study by the Demos think-tank found. Demos said the survey showed a 'spiral of white British demographic decline' as white Britons choose to leave minority-dominated areas. Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the findings should make us 'a little anxious', and were 'not good news for the cause of integration'. He said: 'What ought to make us a little anxious is the “majority retreat” it has unearthed – white people leaving minority-led areas and not being replaced.' In 2005, Mr Phillips warned Britain was 'sleepwalking into segregation' as the UK was dividing into 'ghettos' of particular races and religions. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the MigrationWatch think-tank, said: 'This is extremely serious. It is undeniable evidence that we have indeed been  sleepwalking into segregation as Trevor Phillips warned, and it is the clear result of Labour's mass immigration policy. 'Public dismay at the pace of change in our communities largely explains why so many voted as they did in last week's local elections. The case for a sharp reduction in immigration is now overwhelming; we cannot possibly integrate new arrivals on anything like the present scale.' Change: London has been a centre of 'white flight', with the number of minority residents increasing . Segregation: Many areas of the capital have been deserted by their white British residents . More than 600,000 white British Londoners have left the capital in a decade, it was reported earlier this year. Census figures show that between 2001 and 2011 the level of 'white flight' reached 620,000.It is the equivalent of a city the size of Glasgow - made up entirely of white Britons - moving out of the capital. The figures mean that for the first time, white Britons are in a minority in the country's largest city. At the same time, some rural areas have seen a rise in the proportion of people who describe their ethnicity as 'white British'. Some 3.7million Londoners classified themselves as white British in 2011 – down from 4.3million in 2001 – despite the city's population increasing by nearly a million over the decade to 8.2million. It was reported in February that white Britons made up 45 per cent of the city's population, compared with 58 per cent in 2001. Behind white Britons, the largest ethnic group in London is Asians (18 per cent). Black Londoners make up 13 per cent. Demos said the change was the result . of 'white retreat', where departing white Britons are replaced by . migrants and 'the natural growth of the minority population'. Its . analysis of the 2011 Census showed 4.6million ethnic minorities – or 45 . per cent of the total – live in areas where white Britons make up less . than half the population. Some 4.1million ethnic minorities . live in council wards in which all whites – including foreign nationals – . add up to less than half the total. That compares with only a million . ethnic minorities – 25 per cent of the total – in the same situation at . the time of the 2001 Census. Such areas include Yardley in Birmingham and several council wards in East and South London, Demos said. At the same time, it showed more ethnic minority families were moving into 'white-dominated' parts of the country. There are now just 800 council wards out of 8,850 where the population is 98 per cent white. That compares with 5,000 in 2001. Mr Phillips said: 'This very interesting piece of research reveals a number of vital findings about how people in England and Wales are living together. 'First, it shows a kind of “Ambridge effect” – a welcome minority advance into areas previously only the preserve of the white majority. 'It also demonstrates a greater degree of ethnic mixing within cities, although unfortunately this appears to be mostly between minorities.' 'Flight': Whites make up less than half the population in several council wards in east London, pictured . The 'Ambridge effect' refers to the . arrival of ethnic minority characters in recent years into plotlines on . the Radio 4 soap The Archers. David Goodhart, director of Demos, said the survey identified a growing population which is 'geographically separate' and has 'limited familiarity with majority cultural codes'. He added: 'The greater concentration of the ethnic minority population means there is less opportunity for interaction with the white mainstream.' Eric Kaufmann, a professor at Birkbeck College who carried out the detailed analysis, said: 'These results present a mixed picture. While ethnic mixing and integration is being helped by more minority people moving into England's whitest areas, the most concentrated minority areas are just becoming more so.'","Census figures show white Britons are leaving areas where they are minority .

"A married woman whose husband donated sperm without her knowledge is calling for clinics to be forced to ask for a wife's consent. The unnamed mother-of-one from Surrey said she feared that children fathered with the sperm – who would be half-brothers or sisters of her son – may one day 'disrupt' the family by getting in touch. She has written to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority calling for guidelines on sperm donation to include the spouse's views – and says the sperm should be treated as a joint 'marital asset'. The unnamed woman has made contact with Diane Blood (pictured) who conceived two children using her late husband's frozen sperm after a legal battle . In marriage, sperm should be considered some kind of 'marital asset', wife argues . A controversial ruling in 2005 meant . all children born through sperm donation – up to ten families are . allowed per donor – have the right to trace their biological father when . they reach adulthood. In her heartfelt letter to the . fertility watchdog, she told how her husband had donated sperm against . her wishes after suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder following the . birth of their child. But if the children he fathers – to . help infertile couples or single women – contacted her in the future, . she would 'not feel able to push them away'. The businesswoman said: 'I am . personally in this situation with my husband having donated sperm . against my wishes when he was suffering from PTSD. 'Despite my contacting the clinic (I . never received an acknowledgment), this sperm may already have been used . to father children who in 18 years' time may come knocking on our door, . disrupting family life and unsettling our own children.' Sperm donation helps infertile couples to have families and is also used for research purposes . She added: 'There is then a huge . emotional debt I would owe the child. I would not feel that I could push . them away. It is something I would need to explain to our son. 'It is not something I had ever . imagined having to encounter. It would almost feel like introducing the . offspring of an adulterous relationship.' The wife believes that the procedure . for sperm donation 'should also include the wife or partner being asked . about their views and signalling consent.' She said: 'I think it is a decision both parties should make. It [the sperm] must be some sort of marital asset.' The woman has made contact with Diane . Blood, the widow who won a legal battle to conceive her two children . using her late husband's frozen sperm after his sudden death from . meningitis. Mrs Blood said: 'There needs to be a . public discussion about the matter. When fighting my own case I quoted . the marriage vows which say “All that I am is yours”. Sperm donors are recruited through . licensed clinics and are not paid but can claim reasonable expenses for . travel and lost earnings. A man who has donated sperm may withdraw his . consent before it has been used. There is no obligation for clinics to . establish whether the wife objects, although some counsellors suggest . men discuss the subject with their partner. Since the 2005 ruling . against donor anonymity, they must provide a name and address. Dr Gulam Bahadur, a former HEFA board . member and specialist in men's health at Homerton University Hospital in . London said he was 'grateful the point had been raised'. He said: 'At the moment, the person . from whose body the sperm comes has total say over its use, but if this . use impacts on the wife's family life, the situation is not cut and . dried.' An HEFA spokesman said: 'Donors must, . by law, be offered counselling to discuss their donation before it takes . place.

"The general consensus up until the late 20th century was that after Earth’s formation 4.54 billion years ago, the planet was a hellish place covered in magma. But now scientists say conditions on Earth for the first 500 million years after it formed may have been surprisingly similar to the present day complete with oceans and even continents. Researchers say that ancient rocks in Iceland indicate that early Earth had a more moderate temperature and was more hospitable than thought. Researchers at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee say that the young Earth (pictured from space on the ISS in 2007) might not have been inhospitable to life. It had been thought that in its first 500 million years after its formation 4.54 billion years ago our planet was covered in magma and was a hellish place . The study was conducted by a team of geologists from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. They examined a long-standing theory that modern Iceland is an analogue of the early Earth. Previously it had been thought that Iceland’s crust, which formed from magma that is much hotter than anywhere else on the planet, was similar to Earth’s in its first 500 million years. However in the study the researchers examined zircons - crystals that have existed almost since Earth’s formation - in Iceland. The first 500 million years of the Earth's life are known as the Hadean Eon. Although this time amounts to more than 10 percent of Earth's history, little is known about it, since few rocks are known that are older than 3.8 billion years old. For much of the Hadean, Earth and its sister worlds in the inner solar system were pummeled with an extraordinary number of cosmic impacts. And they found that while the zircons on Iceland were indicative of a hot formation, they did not match the composition of zircons found elsewhere on Earth. This suggest that Iceland is not a model for the young Earth - and instead Earth 4 billion years ago was not as hellish as thought. ‘We discovered that Icelandic zircons are quite distinctive from crystals formed in other locations on modern Earth,’ explained Vanderbilt doctoral student Tamara Carley who was part of the study. ‘We also found that they formed in magmas that are remarkably different from those in which the Hadean zircons grew.’ Analysis of zircon crystals - remants of the ancient Earth - in Iceland suggests our planet was hospitable early in its formation. Shown are images of a collection of Icelandic zircons taken with a scanning electron microscope. They range in size from a tenth of a millimeter to a few thousandths of a millimeter . The researchers found that while zircons on Iceland grew from hot magma, they did not match zircons found elsewhere on Earth, suggesting Iceland was not an analogue of the young Earth. Pictured is Professor Miller, who led the study, at the Kerlingarfjoll volcano in central Iceland . Carley collected samples from volcanoes and sands derived from the erosion of Icelandic volcanoes. She separated thousands of zircon crystals from the samples, which cover the island's regional diversity and represent its 18 million year history. Together with other scientists she analysed about 1,000 zircon crystals for their age and elemental isotopic compositions. Most importantly, their analysis found that Icelandic zircons grew from much hotter magmas than Hadean zircons. Although surface water played an important role in the generation of both Icelandic and Hadean crystals, in the Icelandic case the water was extremely hot when it interacted with the source rocks. By comparison, the Hadean water-rock interactions were at significantly lower temperatures. ‘Our conclusion is counterintuitive,’ said Professor Calvin Miller, who led the study. ‘Hadean zircons grew from magmas rather similar to those formed in modern subduction zones, but apparently even ""cooler"" and ""wetter"" than those being produced today.’ The researchers would suggest Iceland is not an analogue of Earth, and instead our young planet may have had more moderate temperatures as opposed to being a hellish place as shown in this illustration. This means that in its first 500 million years continents and even oceans could have formed on the surface of Earth .","Researchers at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee say that the young Earth might not have been inhospitable to life .
It had been thought that in its first 500 million years after its formation 4.54 billion years ago our planet was covered in magma and was a hellish place .
But analysis of zircon crystals in Iceland suggests this is not the case .

The 12 Dinky toys, including this one with the Hornby Trains on it, were bought by a private collector . Experts at Special Auction Services in Newbury, Berkshire, were amazed when the toys, which cost the equivalent of 2.5p in the 1930s, fetched double their estimated guide price. Toy expert Hugo Marsh said the vans were a 'collector's dream'. 'The two boxes contain the first Dinky Toys ever made that featured advertising on them, produced in 1933 when the brand was in its infancy', he said. He added: 'To find one example of an early dinky toy is rare, and to come across a complete box of them is incredibly rare. 'To have two boxes, consecutively numbered, in the same sale is unheard of - up until now it had never happened before.

"A British couple on a round-the-world cycling tour have been killed in a road crash in Thailand. Peter Root and Mary Thompson, both artists aged 34 from Guernsey in the Channel Islands, set off on a global adventure in July 2011 and had cycled through Europe, the Middle East and China. But the couple died on Wednesday when they were run over by the driver of a pick-up truck while riding their bicycles on a road 70 miles east of Bangkok in Phanom Sarakham, Chachoengsao. Round the world: The British couple were killed in a road crash in Thailand, the 23rd country in their cycling tour . Tragedy: Peter Root (left) and Mary Thompson (right), both artists aged 34 from Guernsey in the Channel Islands, set off on a global adventure in July 2011 and had cycled through Europe, the Middle East and China . They were in their 23rd country when tragedy struck. Mr Root's devastated father Jerry today said he heard of the tragedy on Wednesday and described the pair as a ‘golden couple’ who ‘loved life’. Mr Root was visited by a Guernsey Police officer and asked for authorities to repatriate the bodies immediately. He said friends and family will be notified about a celebration of the couple’s life. Thailand is well known for its perilous roads, with more than 13,000 killed and almost 1million injured each year in accidents. A Foreign & Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the deaths of two British nationals in Thailand on February 13 and we are providing consular assistance.’ Round the world: The couple died earlier this week when they were run over by the driver of a pick-up truck while riding their bicycles on a road 70 miles east of Bangkok in Phanom Sarakham, Chachoengsao . Mr Root was born in Jersey but grew up in Guernsey. Miss Thompson was originally from Bristol. They met 14 years ago at a college in Falmouth, Cornwall. During their trip, the couple documented their experiences on a website called Two on Four Wheels. They had cycled through Europe and a number of danger areas including Iran and Afghanistan. Next to his successful career as a talented artist, Mr Root was also a lecturer in art and media. Miss Thompson, who graduated with a degree in fine art from University College Falmouth in 2001, was also an artist.

"A stalker obsessed with former EastEnders star  Brooke Kinsella visited her murdered brother's grave, bombarded her with unwanted messages and even bought her a wedding dress. Paul Mason, 40, nicknamed  the actress 'pumpkin' and followed her to events during a terrifying three-month stalking campaign where he told her: 'You will be my wife'. Today he was convicted of stalking Miss Kinsella at Bexley Magistrates' Court and will be sentenced on December 10. The terrified actress, who set up the Ben Kinsella Trust to campaign against knife crime after her sibling's murder in 2008, was initially tipped off about the stalker by the Home Office. Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Actress Brooke Kinsella was stalked by Paul Mason, right, who bought her gifts, bombarded her with messages and even got her a wedding dress . In texts sent to Miss Kinsella's phone, dreadlocked Mason, who obtained her number through a website, wrote: 'Your wedding dress is ready pumpkin'. Another said: ''Pumpkin I will be coming down Saturday to see you and the kids' - in reference to the True Stars Academy, her performing arts school for children in Hoxton, north London. Target: Mason would attend events linked to the murder of Brooke's brother Ben, and even visited his grave, a court heard . On one occasion Mason turned up at a trust event with perfume, oils, a scarf and numerous CDs containing his own songs. At another event held at the Lion Centre next to Millwall Football Club he managed to get close enough to give her a  hug. Miss Kinsella, 31, who gave evidence from behind a curtain at Bexley Magistrates' Court, said she received a warning about Mason from the Home Office. She said: 'I had been given a warning from the Home Office about him which really frightened me. 'The whole thing was just really worrying. Without having been told by the police to be vigilant I might not have been so worried about it. 'But I'm glad they did tell me. It really frightened me and it upsets me - the not knowing. Not knowing when the next contact from him will come.' 'I remember noticing him at the Lion Centre in the crowd. Then all of a sudden he came up to me and hugged me. 'I didn't know what to do. There was a lot of press and people around so I just kept it short and sweet and said 'hi Paul' and left it at that..' Family: Jade Kinsella, Brooke Kinsella and Georgia Kinsella organised a march following the death of Ben in 2008 . 'I turned up at the Bromley Theatre for a rehearsal and one of the theatre staff said to me 'your friend was waiting for you' I asked who it was and she told me it was Paul. Criminal: Police found a poster of Miss Kinsella on Mason's wall and a series of hand-written love letters on his bed . 'When I saw the message 'you will be my wife' it really shocked me. It was frightening. 'I felt really very threatened by his messages and the whole thing was escalating before me. That was what worried me the most.' Mason constantly set up new Facebook accounts which he was able to message the star through. Abigail Kegg, manager of the Ben Kinsella Trust, recognised many of the messages because of their personal nature. She told the court how she confronted Mason when he went to the Lion Centre in August last year with gifts. She told Mason: 'I don't think Brooke is expecting you, I don't think she wants your gift and I don't think she is your friend.' Giving evidence, Miss Kegg told the court how at this point Mason lifted his shirt and showed her a 'huge scar' on his stomach he claimed was the result of being stabbed several years ago. Miss Kegg told Mason she would accept the gifts on Miss Kinsella's behalf on the condition he left. He was arrested on suspicion of stalking in April a few days after the hugging incident. At his home police found a poster of Miss Kinsella on the wall and a series of hand-written love letters on his bed. During the trial, an erratic Mason lifted his shirt to caress his scar, mumbled to himself in the dock and tried to take evidence claiming the love letters he wrote were part of his autobiography. Mason was found guilty of stalking and will be sentenced on December 10. He stalked the actress between January 1 to April 4 last year.","Paul Mason has admitted a three-month stalking campaign against actress .

"Six Muslim faith schools in London are expected to be branded inadequate today over fears that they are not preparing pupils for life in modern Britain. In a memo to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, Ofsted inspectors are expected to highlight ‘serious concerns’. They will also criticise a leading state school in the same east London borough after it emerged that sixth-formers used a Facebook page to post references to Sheikh Omar Suleiman, an Islamic preacher who has called homosexuality a ‘disease’ and a ‘repugnant shameless sin’. Scroll down for video . Inspection: Sir John Cass’s Foundation and Redcoat Church of England School (above) in Stepney, east London, will be criticised in a report by Ofsted for failing to safeguard pupils from extremism . The problems at Sir John Cass Foundation and Redcoat CofE School in Stepney have echoes of the recent Trojan Horse affair, which engulfed schools in Birmingham, said to have been infiltrated by Islamic extremists. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, will publish a series of reports on schools in Tower Hamlets today alongside the advice note to Mrs Morgan. Ofsted is expected to say it has ‘serious concerns’ over Sir John Cass and the six private Muslim faith schools. The watchdog will claim that the lack of a broad and balanced curriculum in the six faith schools was preparing pupils poorly for life in modern Britain, according to the advice note leaked to Channel 4 News. In all six schools, pupils’ physical and educational welfare were also at serious risk, inspectors said. The schools focused intensively on developing Islamic knowledge at the expense of other important subjects on the curriculum, it is claimed. Inspectors noted very limited opportunities to learn about history and geography other than those aspects relating to Islam. Music, drama and art were rarely taught. Ofsted will today condemn the Sir John Cass school, which was previously rated as ‘oustanding’, for failing to protect pupils from extremism. Inspectors are expected to accuse staff of failing to act on police warnings about social media sites produced by a sixth-form Islamic society at the school. They are likely to warn that Islamic society Facebook pages are linked to individuals associated with extremist activity. Pages still available online show that pupils cited Sheikh Suleiman, an American preacher who has voiced explicitly anti-gay views. On his own Facebook page, Sheikh Suleiman, a scholar at a conservative Islamic teaching institute, asked followers: ‘When Allah describes homosexuality as a repugnant shameless sin and details his punishment of a people that practised sodomy, how can anyone who believes in Allah not find it immoral?’ He also said: ‘If as Muslims we don’t take a clear stance on this, we will be forced to conform and watch this disease destroy our children.’ In a separate posting, he said: ‘Practising homosexuality is a sin like adultery, drinking, etc. The sin should be condemned, and the sinner should be called to the path of the Most Merciful.’ It does not appear that pupils at Sir John Cass quoted these particular comments but referred to the sheikh in a different context. Report: The school (pictured), which has failed its inspection as a result, is the first institution outside Birmingham to fail on such a safeguarding issue since the so-called Trojan Horse plot was uncovered . Sir John’s headmaster Haydn Evans (above) is said to have been ‘shell-shocked’ by the developments . Quotes posted from the sheikh refer to how the Islamic faith can ease the pain of grief. Ofsted is expected to criticise a lack of monitoring of a YouTube channel set up by the Islamic society. Further criticisms are expected to centre on playground segregation of boys and girls, which the school says is an historical arrangement. In 2008, Ofsted estimated 93 per cent of the school’s intake was from ethnic minority groups, with two-thirds from Bangladeshi backgrounds. About 80 per cent of students were classed as bilingual. The school, once one of the lowest-performing in the country, was transformed into one of Britain’s most successful inner-city comprehensives by head Haydn Evans. It was graded ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in its last two inspections, but it will be put into special measures for failing to safeguard pupils. There were claims from local education sources last night that Ofsted was ‘over-reacting’ to problems in Tower Hamlets, which they said were different from the Trojan Horse affair. ‘There are no governors wanting to take over the school and introduce hardline Islamic practices,’ said one. Robert McCulloch-Graham, director of education at Tower Hamlets Council, said: ‘Where any issues in our maintained schools do occur, we have a strong record of intervening swiftly and successfully to address them. We will work with the leadership of this school to address any issues identified by Ofsted.’","Pupils at school in Stepney, east London, 'exposed to Islamic extremism'

During an impassioned keynote speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, Castro attacked Mitt Romney's stance on immigration as the result of a party that 'doesn't get it'. The 37-year old, a rising star in Texas but little known on the national stage, roused the packed audience at the Time Warner Center by claiming that 'Mitt Romney, quite simply, doesn't get it.'

Mr Castro's tale was in part standard political fare for a party seeking to solidify its standing among immigrant voters. Raised by a single mother born in the U.S. and a grandmother who had emigrated from Mexico, Mr Castro and his identical twin brother Joaquin achieved happiness and success through hard work and a good education made possible by the American dream. But from there, he pivoted to an assault on Republican Mr Romney, whose policies Mr Castro said would 'dismantle' the middle-class if elected. He said: 'We know that in our free market economy some will prosper more than others. What we don't accept is the idea that some folks won't even get a chance. 'And the thing is, Mitt Romney and the Republican party are perfectly comfortable with that America.'

Mr Castro . also taunted Mr Romney for his shifting positions on issues like . abortion rights, gay marriage and his own push for universal health care . as governor of Massachusetts. He said: 'Gov Romney has undergone an extreme makeover, and it isn't pretty.' The Romney campaign shot back at Mr Castro's claim the GOP presidential nominee is insensitive to the middle-class.

BlackBerry Passport has a full HD 4.5-inch square screen, which is said . to offer a similar viewing space to a 5-inch phone, but ‘an even better . viewing experience’ because of the screen’s width. It will be first time BlackBerry has launched a new device, globally, since its BlackBerry 10 devices in 2013. The Passport was first revealed in June by BlackBerry boss John Chen during the company's quarterly earnings report. The project was previously known as Windermere, and Mr Chen said at the time that Passport would be officially announced at an event in London in . September. The Passport combines a large touchscreen with a physical keyboard. BlackBerry chief executive John Chen first revealed the square phone (pictured) during the Canadian company's annual general meeting in June . In June , BlackBerry announced it was offering . 240,000 Android apps to its smartphone users in a surprise deal with . Amazon. The . deal lets BlackBerry add a selection of consumer apps to its . devices, and to focus on developing enterprise and productivity . applications. For example, BlackBerry customers will be able to access popular . Android apps such as Groupon, Netflix, Pinterest, Candy Crush Saga and . Minecraft. The . apps will be available on BlackBerry 10 devices from autumn, when . the company rolls out the BlackBerry 10.3 operating system, the . statement said. Further details were unveiled by Matt Young on the Inside BlackBerry blog . in July: ‘Consider how IMAX movies begin with the screens set to a more . traditional 16:9 aspect ratio projection for conventional movie . trailers, before expanding to their true dimensions. 'The Passport is like the IMAX of productivity, and you don’t have to sacrifice screen real estate, vertically or horizontally.' Academic research has shown that the optimal number of characters on a line in a book is 66 characters. Most . rectangular smartphones show approximately 40 characters per line, . while the BlackBerry Passport is said to show 60 characters. This makes the Passport ‘the ideal device for reading e-books, viewing documents and browsing the web.’ It also solves the problem of having to switch between landscape and portrait mode when taking a photo or filming a video. ‘We’ve . been living in a rectangular world for quite some time and know it’s a . great ergonomic design that drives content, media consumption and quick . communications,’ continued Mr Young. The Passport (right) was unveiled alongside Blackberry's touchscreen phone the Z3 (left), and the Classic (centre) in a slide, earlier this year. It is unclear how comfortable the phone will be to hold, when making a call for example . ‘However, the rectangle has become a defacto approach to smartphone design, perhaps limiting innovations. ‘Just as a passport is the universal symbol of mobility and was the inspiration for the size and form factor of this device, your BlackBerry Passport becomes your ticket to open new doors of opportunity.’ It is unclear how comfortable the phone will be to hold, when making a call for example, and BlackBerry has not released any details about the price. The blog post did, however, position the device more towards businesses than consumers. For example, it stated architects and mortgage brokers could use it to look at full designs and schematics on the go. While medical staff could view X-rays and medical documents in the office with a patient . Mr Young . concluded: ‘The BlackBerry Passport will take you to new places on the . best business trip you’ve ever had. We want you to imagine the . possibilities.’ [caption] . The . move is the latest by the smartphone pioneer to streamline its focus as . it attempts to reinvent itself under new chief executive John Chen. BlackBerry phones have recently lost ground to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy devices. Chen . wants to remain a competitor in the smartphone segment, but is focused . on making BlackBerry a dominant force in machine-to-machine . communications. The . company's QNX software already is a mainstay in the automobile . industry, powering electronic and other systems in a wide range of cars. BlackBerry . already works with hundreds of large enterprise clients including . corporations and government agencies to manage and secure mobile devices . on their internal networks.

"Tony Blair has been handed an award for spending billions of taxpayers’ money on foreign aid. The former prime minister was honoured by Save The Children, a charity whose UK chief once worked for him in No 10. He received the award at a star-studded ceremony in New York. But critics said it was undeserved, accusing him of leaving the country bankrupt and saying his legacy was nothing to celebrate. Scroll down for video . Celeb bash: Former prime minister Tony Blair speaks on stage at the 2nd Annual Save The Children Illumination Gala at the Plaza Hotel in New York City after he is awarded the charity's Global Legacy Award . Mr Blair, who set Britain on course towards spending 0.7 per cent of its national income on overseas aid, was given the Save The Children Global Legacy Award in recognition of his leadership in international development. The UK arm of the charity is headed by Justin Forsyth, who worked as an adviser for both Mr Blair and his successor Gordon Brown. Looking sharp: Mr Blair rubbed shoulders with Hollywood royalty including Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner as guest of honour at the star-studded event . Mr Forsyth was accused by Tories of changing Save The Children into a politically motivated organisation two years ago when it launched a campaign for the children of the UK, claiming many could not afford shoes or hot meals. Mr Blair hobnobbed with Hollywood stars as guest of honour at the ceremony in New York. Hero dog: Lassie, or rather her latest incarnation, was also among the guests at the sumptuous gala event . The latest incarnation of Lassie the dog was among the guests, along with actor and director Ben Affleck, his wife Jennifer Garner and actress Dakota Fanning. As prime minister, Mr Blair set up the Department for International Development and hosted a series of aid summits. Critics say Britain’s foreign aid budget – which hit £11.4billion last year – has led to a string of perverse outcomes, including spending millions in countries such as India which can afford its own space programme. Accepting his award last night, Mr Blair said: ‘From the beginning of humankind there has been brutality, conflict, intrigue, the destructive obsession with a narrow self-interest. But throughout all human history, never has been extinguished that relentless, unquenchable desire to do good. To act not only in self-interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it.’ A spokesman for Save The Children said: ‘The UK’s achievement of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to international aid in 2014 is the culmination of work started under [Mr Blair’s] leadership.’ But Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, said: ‘I am not sure that giving overseas aid to China and India and setting us on the path to the biggest crash in a century is anything to celebrate.’ Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, said: ‘This award is undeserved and frankly I think most British people will find it totally inappropriate that someone who has left the country bankrupt is honoured in this way.’ Star-studded bash: From left to right, Blair, Mike Bezos, Dakota Fanning, and Nicholas Kristof .

"Up to 100 people, including civilians and pro-Russian fighters, have been killed during a 24-hour bloodbath in the eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk. Dozens of militants were reported dead in a furious battle for control of the airport in the key city of Donetsk where bodies were lying in the streets. Pro-Moscow rebels said they may have up to 100 dead as morgues in the city struggled to cope with the shocking death toll. Other estimates put the death toll at closer to 50.

Violence erupted on Monday when rebels moved to seize the city airport and were repelled by Ukraine forces which used combat jets and helicopter gunships. It came as the Kiev government sought to wipe out pro-Russian insurgents amid claims of Stalinist-style executions of rebel deserters. In chilling scenes, there were claims several rebel commanders had been 'sentenced to death by shooting' with notices saying the 'executions' were conducted under a law enacted by Stalin's Supreme Soviet during the Second World War. An order from the separatist militia in Donetsk claimed that 'commanders' Dmitry Slavov and Nikolay Lukyanov had been executed by a shot to the head. Two other officers of Gorkovka police were also 'shot dead in front of all other policemen for betraying Donetsk Republic', it was reported. The orders to execute were signed by Igor Strelkov, real surname Girkin, who is claimed by the Ukrainians to be a Russian career intelligence officer. The rebel commanders were accused of ""abandonment of combat positions"" under a Stalin law dated 22 June 1941.

This is the funeral ceremony organised for the Ukrainian soldier in the town of Karlovka today . But shooting continued through the night and by mid-morning machine gun fire could be heard on one of the main roads leading to the airport. On Tuesday, Arsen Avakov, the interior minsiter, said the airport was 'completely under control', adding 'The adversary suffered heavy losses. We have no losses.' But it was plain that Kiev was struggling for control despite a heavy use of force. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said it had lost contact with a four-member team in Donetsk after they were held at a checkpoint. Miners went on strike against the military operation by the Kiev authorities, while in the war zone of Slavyansk there were calls to evacuate children from the carnage.

"A senator took an unorthodox approach to appeal to voters on Saturday as she helped college students do keg stands at a football game. Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu, who is up for re-election, joined in the wild antics during a Louisiana State University Tigers game against Mississippi State University's Bulldogs. The 58-year-old senator, who attended LSU, joined those tailgating in the parking lot and even helped one fraternity brother, who was lifted upside down on the keg, by holding the nozzle to let him chug beer. Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu (pictured right) helped LSU college football fans on Saturday as they performed keg stands . Ms Landrieu holds the beer-keg nozzle for LSU football fan as he does a keg stand at a tailgate party on the Louisiana State University campus before the game on Saturday . Ms Landrieu, who is up for re-election against Republican Representative Bill Cassidy, appeared to be popular among students, who chanted: 'Mary! Mary!', NBC reported. She did not take part in her own keg stand challenge. Her rival Rep. Cassidy stopped by the party soon after but didn't appear to have taken part in any  keg stand antics. The images of the keg-stand party popped up on Twitter on Saturday. One was accompanied by the caption: 'Mary Landrieu wants your vote - and will help you keg-stand in order to get it.' The senator's show of school spirit didn't much help the final score with LSU losing 34-29 to the MSU Bulldogs. Ms Landrieu, who is married with two children, graduated from LSU in 1977 and was a member of  the Delta Gamma sorority. For the uninitiated, a keg stand is a drinking game popular at student parties where an individual does a handstand, often with help of bystanders, to drink for as long as possible from the beer tap on the keg.

"Meet the pampered pet who only eats food from Marks and Spencer, has his paws washed with designer soap if he steps outside - and costs his owners a staggering £5,000 a year. Louis, a Lhasa Apso, detests dog food and will only eat organic scrambled eggs for breakfast, smoked salmon for lunch and Marks and Spencer egg fried rice for dinner, and according to devoted owner Jo Jose, 60, she often hand feeds him. Louis, or Lou-Lou as he is known to Jo, 60 and husband Graham, 72 from Loughborough, Leics, regularly enjoys being pampered and having his long fur washed with salon bought shampoo - and always enjoys a proper blow dry. Louis, here with doting Jo, only eats food from Marks and Spencer and  has his paws washed with designer soap if he steps outside . Louis has a list a demands which he likes Jo and Graham to meet, including having his face washed and being talked to at all times . If he goes outside Jo will make sure . Louis’ paws are hand washed with designer Bulgari soap - costing £10 a . bar - as according to Jo it makes Louis fur come out the cleanest. Doting Jo said: 'Lou Lou is utterly spoiled. He eats better than most people do and is very demanding. 'For . a dog, he is very independent and exudes an air of dignity. He has a . beautiful long coat is an impressive sight.' Jo admits that Louis, pictured here with his favorite Chardonnay wine, is more like a 'spoilt child' than a dog . Jo will wash and condition Lou-Lou¿s long fur with Treseme shampoo and conditioner and the pampered dog will often fall asleep while being brushed. Louis descends from a long line of Crufts champions but he demands to be treated like a human and Jo and Graham think of the 10-year-old mutt as a 'spoilt child.' After being taken for a long walk at 7am with Graham, in manicured gardens near the family’s home, Louis will demand breakfast for 9.30am sharp. Jo said: 'It’s as if Louis knows the time and he will come up to me and make it known that he is hungry. Longhaired Louis takes a lot of grooming and loves to be fussed over, including having his teeth done daily . Louis demands his meals at 9.30am and 6.30pm sharp, and often ends up being hand-fed .

Jo and her husband Graham, 72, like to go on holiday to Abu Dhabi four times a year and before they book their holiday they make sure Louis can stay at The Grove, a luxury dog hotel which caters to Louis’ every whim. Jo said: 'The Grove is fantastic for looking after Louis and cooking him all his different meals at the correct times. They really accommodate for every one of Louis’ needs and we couldn’t be more grateful. 'As soon as we get to our hotel in Abu Dhabi we will video call The Grove and make sure we can speak to Louis.' Every birthday, the couple will buy a card for Louis with his age on, and Louis will receive a Marks and Spencer Victoria sponge cake, with candles on it. Jo said: 'We like Lou-Lou to feel special and he enjoys a slice of the cake. We always treat him around Christmas and birthdays - he is like our child.'

"Scientists have created a technique which can cause cancer cells to self-destruct by injecting them with salt. Researchers from the University of Southampton are part of an international team that has helped to create a molecule that can kill the disease by carrying sodium and chloride ions into the cells. Synthetic ion transporters have been created before but this is the first time researchers have demonstrated how an influx of salt into a cell triggers cell death. These synthetic ion transporters, . described this week in the journal Nature Chemistry, could point the way . to new anti-cancer drugs while also benefiting patients with cystic . fibrosis. Scientists at the University of Southampton have created a new technique, which can cause cancer cells to self destruct, by injecting them with salt . Researchers have found a molecule can kill the disease, by carrying sodium and chloride ions into the cells . Study co-author Professor Philip Gale, of the University of Southampton, said: 'This work shows how chloride transporters can work with sodium channels in cell membranes to cause an influx of salt into a cell. 'We found we can trigger cell death with salt.' Cells in the human body work hard to maintain a stable concentration of ions inside their cell membranes. Disruption of this delicate balance can trigger cells to go through apoptosis, known as programmed cell death, a mechanism the body uses to rid itself of damaged or dangerous cells. One way of destroying cancer cells is to trigger this self-destruct sequence by changing the ion balance in cells. Unfortunately, when a cell becomes cancerous, it changes the way it transports ions across its cell membrane in a way that blocks apoptosis. It is hoped the breakthrough will help pave the way for new anti-cancer drugs. Pictured are cancer cells under the microscope . The researchers have overcome this by developing the synthetic way for transporting the ions but unfortunately this also destroys healthy cells which would have to be overcome for it to be useful in treating cancer. Prof Jonathan Sessler, at Austin's College of Natural Sciences at the University of Texas, said: 'We have thus closed the loop and shown that this mechanism of chloride influx into the cell by a synthetic transporter does indeed trigger apoptosis. 'This is exciting because it points the way towards a new approach to anti-cancer drug development.'","Scientists at the University of Southampton have helped create a technique that can cause cancer cells to self-destruct .

"Gone are the days when history buffs waited to stumble across a lucky find while out walking. Now treasure hunters are using the internet to make their own fortunes. One man has stunned professional archaeologists by locating a Bronze Age settlement using Google Earth. Howard Jones’ online research was proved correct when he unearthed 5,000-year-old flint tools and other evidence of habitation. Spotted: One man has stunned professional archaeologists by locating a Bronze Age settlement using Google Earth. This aerial picture taken in 1989 shows the area in Spriddlestone, South Devon. The lines indicate the location of the prehistoric buildings thought to lie beneath the earth . He began his search for a settlement by trawling satellite images for the sort of terrain that would have offered food, water and shelter to prehistoric man. Using Google’s overhead mapping website to zoom in on fields and farmland, he managed to pinpoint a site in Spriddlestone in the South Hams, Devon. The former Royal Marine from Plymstock, Devon, then sought permission from the local landowner before using a metal detector to look for remains. It didn’t take long before he unearthed scraps of metal, pottery shards and flint tools. Unearthed: Howard Jones unearthed scraps of metal, pottery shards and flint tools (pictured) at the prehistoric site. They include an Iron Age hinge from a bucket (the curved piece of metal). Experts hope to find more similar fragments when they excavate the site in February next year . Excavations are ongoing to establish the importance of the settlement, which lies in Spriddlestone in the South Hams, Devon. It is thought to be Bronze Age, or Iron Age. Howard Jones discovered flint tools, pottery fragments and metal shards thought to be 5,000 years old. A geophysical survey revealed two large buried structures thought to be prehistoric farm buildings. Other parts of the settlement could date from Roman times, between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago. The survey images show tracks, enclosures and pits, which could indicate a metal works. Mr Jones told Devon County archaeologist Bill Horner about his discovery, who carried out a geophysical survey using ground-penetrating radar equipment. Together, they found two large buried structures that they believe are farm buildings dating back to the Bronze or Iron Age. Mr Horner said: ‘The survey shows two or three probable farmsteads which look to be late prehistoric, bronze age to Iron Age. ‘Other parts of the underlying settlement possibly continue to the Romano-British period, around 1,500 to 2,000 years ago. ‘The images also show tracks and enclosures, as well as a number of pits, which alongside Howard’s findings, looks like evidence of metal works. ‘We know that Devon’s mineral resources were being traded along the coast and along the channel in prehistoric times. Scanned: The former Royal Marine from Plymstock, Devon, sought permission from the local landowner before using a metal detector to look for evidence of prehistoric habitation on the land (pictured) ‘While Dartmoor is famous for preserved historic sites, the same is not true of coastal areas. So this could be the missing link between those moorland sites and the evidence we have of trading.’ Mr Jones, who is now a commercial diver, said: ‘Night after night I looked at Google Earth asking myself the question ‘if I was alive 3,000 years ago where would I live’. ‘I would need food, water, shelter, close to Dartmoor for minerals, close to a river to access the sea and trade routes. ‘After a few weeks I put an “X marks the spot” on the map - that was where I would live.’ He was initially unable to test his theory because he was unsure who the land belonged to, until he came across the landowner by chance.

Discovered: Mr Jones (pictured right) told archaeologist Bill Horner about his discovery, who carried out a geophysical survey using ground-penetrating radar equipment. They found two large buried structures that they believe are farm buildings dating back to the Bronze or Iron Age. Small finds are pictured left . ‘At kids rugby training one night I remembered that one of the other coaches was a farmer and I asked him if I could field walk and detect on his land. ‘As I didn’t know where his farm was, I arranged for my family and I to meet him and he gave us a tour of his fields. ‘It was then I found out that my “X marks the spot” was on his land - it was unbelievable.’ It is hoped that a series of trench digs, set to take place February next year, will provide further evidence of the prehistoric settlement. Mr Jones has previously searched for ancient artefacts underwater and in 2010 he was involved in the discovery of a 300-year-old Dutch merchant vessel called the Aagtekerke, off the Devon coast.","Former Royal Marine from Plymstock, Devon, trawled Google Earth for terrain that would have offered food, water and shelter to prehistoric men .

"The biological mother of Maria, the blonde girl found in a Roma camp in Greece, has had five of her nine other children taken into care. The Telegraph reported state authorities have taken the children from the home of Bulgarian couple Sasha and Atanas Ruseva. Sasha Ruseva, 35, was proved to be the biological mother of the four-year-old via a DNA test after an international appeal was launched to reveal the girl's true identity. Taken away: Sasha Ruseva (pictured here holding daughter Penka, two), the biological mother of Maria, has had five of her children taken from her . Maria: The four-year-old girl was found after a police raid in Farsala, Greece . Maria was found living in Farsala after a police raid two weeks ago, and Bulgarian authorities have said they will ask Greece to hand her over. Mrs Ruseva, and her two youngest children - Nasko, three, and Penka, two - were moved to housing in Stara Zagora, the regional capital 25 miles from the Roma ghetto on the outskirts of Nikolaevo where the family lived. Kosyo Kosev, the mayor of Nikolaevo, said: 'Social services have decided to settle Mrs Ruseva and her two youngest children in social housing while the other five under age will be re-homed for the time being either in a state institution or with foster families.' The couple also have a two older daughters, aged 20 and 18, who are married and have children of their own. Maria is currently being cared for by . the Smile Of The Child Charity in Athens. She will stay there until . state authorities decide what will happen to her next. Bulgaria's State Agency For Child Protection (SACP) wants Maria returned. Eva Zhecheva, head of the SACP, said: 'Bulgarian . authorities are ready to take full responsibility for Maria now that it . is known she is the child of Bulgarian nationals.' Maria will most likely be taken to a crisis centre or placed in foster care . until she is either returned to her biological family, or found a . permanent home. 'Maria will remain there until a solution is found for her upbringing – a return to her biological family, a placement with relatives, or in a foster home or state institution,' Mrs Zhecheva said. 'We are awaiting a decision from Greek authorities as whether she will be transferred to Bulgaria.' Moved: Mrs Ruseva, and her two youngest children, Nasko, three, and Penka, two, were moved to housing in Stara Zagora, the regional capital 25 miles from the Roma ghetto on the outskirts of Nikolaevo where the family lived (pictured is Sasha and Atanas Ruseva with Penka) Fake parents: Christos Salis, 39, (right) and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, (left) are the Greek Roma couple with whom Maria was found in Farsala. Both have been charged with child abduction and falsifying documents . Mrs Ruseva said she wants Maria to live with her. She is under investigation for allegedly selling her child in Greece where she and her husband were working as olive pickers, before returning to Bulgaria. She denies receiving money for the child and insists she meant to return for her but 'was too poor and then another two babies came along'. Christos Salis, 39, and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, the Greek Roma couple with whom Maria was found in Farsala, have been charged with child abduction and falsifying documents. Their lawyers are expected to appeal the charges and the couple have said they will apply for custody for the child they have brought up 'like their own'.

"It is news that will put a smile on the face  of plenty of women of a certain age – and stop them worrying about the lines it may leave. Anti-ageing creams really do work, scientists claim. Experiments have found that an ingredient in anti-wrinkle creams does have the power to turn back the hands of time. Researchers say chemical called Matrixyl used in some anti-wrinkle creams really can work - by doubling the amount of skin-plumping collagen it produces . The secret weapon, Matrixyl, almost doubles the production of collagen, the anti-wrinkle protein that keeps skin looking plump and youthful. Even better, the ingredient is found in face creams made by high street brands such as Olay, with prices starting at just over £8 for a large tub. Chemist Ian Hamley, who is researching the use of collagen in wound healing, looked at the effect of Matrixyl on sheets of skin cells in a dish. His research, published in the journal Molecular Pharmaceutics, found that when concentrations were high enough, the chemical hugely boosted the amount of collagen made. Collagen (pictured) is a protein that gives skin its strength and elasticity . The Reading University  professor said: ‘Our research shows that products with Matrixyl will have skincare benefits. Studies like this  are very important for the  consumer, as cosmetic companies rarely publish their  work so that rivals don’t copy their products.’ Matrixyl is found in Olay’s Regenerist range, as well as in creams made by less well-known brands such as St Ives and Skin Doctors. Word is already out and some products have sold out online. Previous research has questioned the benefits of creams that contain collagen, claiming it cannot penetrate the skin to get to work. However, Matrixyl – which is a peptide, or protein fragment – stimulates the collagen factories from within the skin. Lisa Haynes, beauty editor at the Press Association, said: ‘Anti-ageing creams frequently boast about being packed full of peptides, but aren’t specific as to which one. ‘Now the secret’s out and there’s some scientific evidence for its collagen-boosting properties, women will be rushing to find out if it’s in their anti-ageing potion. ‘It’s likely that brands with products that do contain Matrixyl will start shouting about it too if the “miracle” peptide becomes the new buzz word in beauty. ‘There was a stampede at Boots in 2007 for No 7 Protect & Perfect Beauty Serum after a BBC2 Horizon programme scientifically backed the lotion. Stand by for the Matrixyl face cream frenzy.’ Around 20 weeks’ supply of Boots Protect & Perfect Beauty Serum sold out in just a day after the Horizon documentary featured a study which revealed it could make the skin look younger. Chief scientist at Olay, Dr Sian Morris, said the company’s ‘studies have shown consistently the abilities [of Matrixyl] to help reduce the appearance of fine lines, improve visible firmness and provide younger-looking skin’.","A chemical called Matrixyl used in some anti-wrinkle creams may double the amount of collagen in skin .

"An American contractor has been killed in Kabul by a policewoman who is said to have mental problems. Authorities also revealed the killer was an Iranian who moved to Afghanistan ten years ago using false documents provided by her husband. The shooting, on Christmas Eve, is the first by a woman in a spate of insider attacks by Afghans against their foreign allies. The policewoman walked into a heavily guarded compound in the centre of the Afghan capital and shot 49-year-old Mr Griffin, a civilian police advisor, with a single bullet. Friend or foe: The killing of an American adviser is the first insider attack committed by a woman . Security: Afghan police stand guard over the compound of the chief of police in the country's capital today . According to an interior ministry . spokesman the woman, a mother-of-four in her early 30s, joined the . police five years ago and had a clean record. ‘Her mental condition is not good,’ he said, describing her behaviour as ‘unstable’. Under interrogation she said her plan . had been to kill either the Kabul governor or  police chief but when she . realised that security was too tight, she saw ‘a foreigner’ and turned . her weapon on him instead. The woman, identified as Afghan . police sergeant Nargas, had entered the strategic compound in the heart . of the capital and shot the adviser with a pistol as he came out of a . small shop with items he had just bought. The policewoman - who like many Afghans only uses her first name - was taken into Afghan custody shortly after the attack. Earlier, she had asked bystanders where the governor's office was located, Kabul governor Abdul Jabar Taqwa said. The killed adviser was a contractor whose identity was not immediately released. The attack occurred outside the police . headquarters in a walled, highly secure compound which also houses the . governor's office, courts and a prison. Kabul deputy police chief Mohammad Daoud Amin said an investigation was under way. Mr Amin said Nargas, a mother of four, had worked with a human rights department of the police for two years and had earlier been a refugee in Pakistan and Iran. Killing: Police outside the Kabul headquarters today following the  'green on blue' attack . Aftermath: U.S. and Afghan security personnel escort a convoy into the compound as investigations begin . Captured: Officials in the capital have said the policewoman is being held in custody . She could enter the compound armed . because as a police officer she was licensed to carry a pistol, the . police official said. Mr Amin did not know whether the killer and victim . were acquainted. Canadian . Brig Gen John C Madower, a command spokesman in Kabul, called the . incident 'a very sad occasion' and said his 'prayers are with the loved . ones of the deceased'. A . Nato command spokesman, US air force Lt Col Lester T Carroll, said: 'We . can confirm that a civilian police adviser was shot and killed this . morning by a suspected member of the Afghan uniformed police. It came just hours after an Afghan policeman shot dead five of his fellow officers at a checkpoint in northern Afghanistan. Senior . officials have described killing as an 'insider attack' - when Afghan . security forces turn their weapons on coalition troops or foreign . contractors. At least 53 international troops have been killed by Afghan soldiers or police this year and a number of other assaults are still under investigation. Nato . forces, due to mostly withdraw from the country by 2014, have speeded . up efforts to train and advise Afghan military and police units before . the pull-out. The surge in insider attacks is throwing doubt on the capability of the Afghan security forces to take over from international troops and has further undermined public support for the 11-year war in Nato countries. More than 50 Afghan members of the government's security forces also have died this year in attacks by their own colleagues. Taliban militants claim such attacks reflect a growing popular opposition to both foreign military presence and the Kabul government. Nato said around 25 per cent of insider attacks are by Taliban infiltrators, with the rest being borne out of personal animosities or cultural differences. In an earlier attack, a policeman shot dead five colleagues late last night in the Jawzjan province. Officials said he then stole the officers' weapons and fled to join the Taliban.

"An American woman whose skin turned silver after using nose drops is warning people of the dangers of medicines containing the metal. Rosemary Jacobs, 71, has lived with the irreversible skin condition argyria for 60 years and it has blighted her life. The retired primary school teacher's skin started to turn silver when she began using nasal drops containing colloidal silver (CS) at the age of 11. Rosemary Jacobs (pictured at 36) has lived with silver skin for 60 years after she was given nose drops containing the metal when she was just 11 years old . Four years later, a skin biopsy revealed silver particles bound deep beneath her skin and she was diagnosed with argyria. Argyria is a condition caused by exposure to chemical forms of the element silver. It causes the skin to become blue or bluish-grey coloured and develops because silver accumulates in the body over time. It is thought to be irreversible. Ms Jacobs, from Vermont, U.S., said: ‘When I was 11 years old, my mother mentioned to an ENT specialist that I always had a cold. ‘He told me that it had to be allergies and prescribed nose drops that contained silver recommending I take them “as needed”.’ Ms Jacobs took the nose drops whenever she had a stuffy nose and it was only until a nurse spotted her argyria that she saw a dermatologist and was diagnosed. Ms Jacobs (pictured at the age of 36) said: 'People point and stare, calling me names and telling me to take my Halloween makeup off' Ms Jacobs has argyria - a condition which is caused by the build up of silver in the body. The main symptom of the condition is that the skin takes on a blue hue . But in the 1950s no treatment was available so she was forced to live with the skin condition. Argyria results from prolonged contact with, or ingestion of, silver. It occurs when silver builds up in the body staining the skin a bluish colour. The condition is most commonly seen in workers involved in silver mining, refining or manufacturing. Cases have also been attributed to taking colloidal silver dietary supplements and surgical procedures involving using silver sutures. The condition is very rare and does not usually cause other symptoms. Source: Medscape . She was subjected to cruel comments from strangers who would think she had a contagious disease and would cross the street when they saw her. Ms Jacobs, who lives alone and has never had a long term relationship, said: ‘They told me my colour was permanent. It was devastating. ‘I have not been a normal colour since and it has blighted my life. ‘People point and stare, calling me names and telling me to take my Halloween makeup off. ‘Some even say I look like the walking dead. ‘I used to get asked where I was from and what languages I speak. ‘It's really hurtful, even though I have looked this way for such a long time I still long to look “normal”. Ms Jacobs has even been discriminated against by employers who refused to hire her because of the way she looks. Ms Jacobs (pictured before using the nose drops) says the colour of her skin has blighted her life meaning she never formed a long-term relationship and is subjected to cruel comments from strangers . Ms Jacobs (pictured before the condition developed) says even after 60 years she still longs to look 'normal' An air hostess once tried to give her oxygen on a plane, after thinking the blood had drained from her face. At 36, desperate to rid her body of . its silver hue, Ms Jacobs underwent a skin dermabrasion, where the top . layer of skin was removed, leaving it red raw. Her face healed, but she was left with a pink and blotchy complexion with patches of grey still visible. She . said: ‘The dermabrasion didn't hurt at all, it just looked awful for a . while afterwards. It took about six months to know what the final colour . would be. Ms Jacobs (pictured at 26) says she has been discriminated against by employers who refused to hire her because of the way she looks . Ms Jacobs (pictured with her mother, Rose, before her skin turned silver) says an air hostess on a plane once tried to give her an oxygen mask when she saw the colour of her face . ‘I did it as an experiment, but I would never let anyone dermabrade my upper or lower eyelids so I knew that if it worked I'd end up looking like a raccoon, so basically still weird. ‘I don't think I look much better now.’ Now, . after years of verbal abuse, cruel remarks and severe skin treatments, . Ms Jacobs is determined to raise awareness of the dangers of taking . supplements and medicines containing silver. She . believes there has been an increase in dietary supplements containing . it and says they should have warning labels about argyria. At 36, Ms Jacobs underwent a skin dermabrasion, where the top layer of skin was removed. Her face healed, but she was left with a pink and blotchy complexion with patches of grey still visible . Ms Jacobs (pictured with her mother, Rose, when her condition was developing) said: 'The change in my skin colour was so slow I didn't notice. My family and friends didn't notice either because they saw me every day. I didn't notice until it was too late' She said: ‘Silver is still present in lots of products sold on the internet. ‘Taking it can ruin your life and people need to know that. ‘The . change in my skin colour was so slow I didn't notice. My family and . friends didn't notice either because they saw me every day. ‘I didn't notice until it was too late.’ There . are a few dozen other cases of argyria worldwide. The most famous was .

"Energy Secretary Ed Davey said Britain had a 'moral duty' to act around the world . Critics of the Government’s spending on foreign aid were dismissed as Little Englanders by the Liberal Democrat climate change secretary yesterday. Ed Davey praised Britain’s £720million pledge to a new UN fund to tackle climate change in the Third World, saying it was our moral duty to act. The UK is among a number of nations meeting in Berlin to contribute to the Green Climate Fund, which helps poor countries adapt to low carbon energy, such as wind. Much of the money will be spent shoring up sea and flood defences in less-developed areas. Tory backbenchers said it would be better spent on flood defences at home, amid fears the Somerset Levels could again be deluged. The National Audit Office said flood spending in England was ‘insufficient’ to maintain defences. But Mr Davey, the Energy and Climate Change Secretary, said: ‘The poorest and most vulnerable on the planet are already suffering the effects of climate change and it’s our moral duty to act. ‘The idea that we should be isolationist Little Englanders is a complete nonsense. ‘From protecting low-lying islands and coastal settlements from the impact of rising sea levels to helping farmers struggling with lower crop yields caused by weather effects of climate change – British aid can save lives. ‘Other major economies such as the US, Japan, Germany and France have made substantial pledges, and I urge other countries to be equally ambitious.’ He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that climate change around the world has implications for the UK, affecting supply chains of groceries and other products. ‘People listening, I think, recognise that we live in a global economy where when something happens in another part of the world it can affect our lives here,’ he said. Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh, former chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said it was not appropriate to spend so much money elsewhere with the UK still borrowing £100billion a year. ‘We have to look at the interests of the taxpayer and our own people,’ he told the same programme. Tory MP Sir Edward Davey said he had no problem with helping other countries, but UK flood defences needed to be shored up . ‘We had appalling scenes at the Somerset Levels last year. I’ve had villages flooded in Lincolnshire. ‘As the NAO said, we’re still not spending enough on flood alleviation. First of all we need to spend the money here. I’m happy to give money to humanitarian projects. 'I’m happy to spend money properly on protecting a village in Bangladesh from being flooded, but I don’t want to commit now to £650million on spec.’ Lord Stern, a former government adviser on climate change, said: ‘To suggest we must choose between investing in flood defences in the UK or helping international efforts to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing sea levels to rise along British coasts . . . is to misunderstand both the phenomenon itself and the basics of policy. 'Reducing risk and managing the effects of climate change must go hand in hand.’ At the Berlin conference, aimed at encouraging governments to give money to the fund, the US has pledged £1.92billion, Japan has offered £959million, and France and Germany will offer £640million each. Mark Goldring, of Oxfam GB, said: ‘This is a big step forward in the fight against climate change and is further evidence that the UK is a global leader in tackling poverty. ‘The money will be crucial in helping poor people protect themselves from the rising sea levels, storms and droughts that climate change will bring. 'This pledge will help build momentum for a global deal in Paris next year to cut emissions.’","Energy Secretary Ed Davey insists the UK has a 'moral duty' to act .

Last night critics asked why Britain was, in effect, subsidising a space programme for a nation where 70 per cent of people live below the poverty line. This latest controversy came just two days after Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom ignited a fierce debate by saying it was folly to give billions in aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’. Big spending: Nigeria has already launched these surveillance rockets from Russia as part of its plans to join the space race . Yesterday David Cameron said the remarks were offensive and accused Mr Bloom of being guilty of a ‘stop the world I want to get off’ approach to foreign aid. The £1.14billion Nigeria will receive over the five years of the Coalition is double the £500million set aside to prop up struggling accident and emergency departments at our own hospitals. Backbench Tory MP Philip Davies said it was ‘totally unjustifiable and unaffordable’ for Britain to give this money to Nigeria, given the scale of its ‘grandiose’ space programme. ‘We cannot go around the world saying “don’t worry, we will feed your public for you while you waste your money on all sorts of other projects”,’ he said. ‘We have got to say to these countries “you have got to spend that money on your people where it’s most needed not on some grandiose space programme”. We are against welfare dependency at home but at the same time we are encouraging welfare dependency abroad.’ The row surrounding Mr Bloom flared when he insisted that sending aid to Africa was tantamount to treason. He added: ‘How we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month, when we’re in this sort of debt, to Bongo Bongo land is completely beyond me.’ He claimed foreign leaders frittered the money away on ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris and Ferraris’. Poverty: Millions of Nigerians are living in poverty, despite the country earning huge profits from its oil deposits . Resources: Nigeria generates millions in oil revenue every year but much of the population lives in poverty . He was widely criticised for using the term ‘Bongo Bongo land’ but many commentators believe he was right about the building resentment over spiralling foreign aid. The Department for International Development’s budget is rising by 35 per cent in real terms by 2015. But while aid costs are ballooning, spending on the military, the police, border control and care homes is being slashed. Britain . is also spending about £280million a year on aid to India, another . country with its own space programme. Despite Nigeria having the . second-highest national income of all African countries, most of its . people still live in poverty. It is also mired in corruption. The most . modest estimates suggest between £2.5 and £5billion is stolen from the . state’s coffers every year by corrupt officials and politicians. Debate: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom has reignited the issue of Britain's foreign aid contributions with his infamous 'bongo bongo land' comments . Jonathan Isaby from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘When budgets are tight both for families and the Government alike, people cannot understand why ministers are sending more and more of our hard-earned cash overseas. ‘Taxpayers find it especially unacceptable when their money is sent abroad as aid to developing countries which then somehow find sufficient cash to fund the likes of a space programme. ‘It is totally unacceptable that British taxpayers’ money is effectively subsidising Nigeria’s efforts to send an astronaut into space.’ Nigeria’s space programme started in 2003 but its first satellite lost power and disappeared from orbit. It now has three in space, NigComSat-1R, NigeriaSat-2 and Nigeria-Sat X, the first to be constructed by Nigerian engineers. Although it has bought its own . satellites and launched on Russian rockets, Nigeria has built . laboratories which it hopes will produce its own space craft by 2028. The . National Space Research and Development Agency confirmed Nigerian . astronauts should be trained and ready for space travel within two . years. In July this . year, NASRDA’s director general, Professor Seidu Onailo Mohammed, . declared: ‘By our road map we are supposed to have astronauts prepared . by 2015. Before the end of the year, the recruitment of astronauts will . begin so that we have them handy and as soon as we get the nod we can . pick from that number.’ The . Nigerian government has not released detailed figures on how much it is . spending on its space programme, but it is thought to be hundreds of . millions of pounds a year. British aid to Nigeria will increase by 116 . per cent under the Coalition government, from £141million in 2010/11 to . £305million in 2014/15. It amounts to a total of £1.14billion over five . years. Response: The Prime Minister David Cameron said Mr Bloom's remarks showed a 'stop the world I want to get off' approach to foreign aid . The country has also been criticised for failing to crack down on corruption. The only senior figure from Nigeria to have been prosecuted over corruption in recent years was jailed by a British court. James Ibori, the former governor of the country’s oil-rich Delta state, was sentenced to 13 years for money laundering, forgery and fraud totalling nearly £50million. He used the money to live a lavish lifestyle, buying a house in London worth £2.25million and luxury cars worth over £650,000. Last night a spokesman for the Department for International Development said spending aid money in Nigeria would help cut crime and illegal immigration in Britain. ‘No UK aid money goes through the Nigerian government,’ she said. ‘Our investment goes into specific health, education and poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria is home to a quarter of the poorest people in Africa, and supporting their development will benefit our own trade and security.’","Oil-rich country has accepted £300million in aid this year alone .

"She caused headlines up and down the country when she revealed on national television that she had been a 'mistress' for six years. But now The Real Housewives Of Cheshire star Ampika Pickston, 32, has clarified that the man in question wasn't married, or even with, anyone else - and they're not together any more. The Opium beauty salon owner said: 'As it stands I have no relationship in my life, I would love to find love.' Scroll down for video . Ampika Pickston poses at her salon in Hale Barns, she has revealed to FEMAIL that she has ended the six year secret relationship she was having as it wasn't going anywhere . Ampika, who originally revealed the relationship in a teary chat with her co-stars filmed for the hit ITVBe show, went on to reveal: 'Doing this TV show highlighted what I really want out of my life and it gave me the encouragement to realise that the situation that I was in, I was never really going to get what I wanted. 'It was time for me to get my balls out and move on and find someone and a situation that is going to work moving forward for me and my son in the future.' Still keeping quiet as to the identity of the gentleman in question, Ampika explained that they are, 'not in a relationship'. She goes on to add: 'It was very emotional when I said what I did, it was a true reflection of how I felt - even though I used the wrong word and it got misinterpreted, after five bottles of champagne my lips got carried away with themselves. 'But I was quite happy to be honest and open with the girls.' At the time of her confession Ampika was hosting a dinner party for her fellow housewives Dawn Ward, Lauren Simon, Tanya Bardsley, Leanne Brown and Magali Gorre at her lavish Cheshire home. Ampika with her co-stars from the hit ITV2 show Real Housewives of Cheshire (L-R) Dawn Warn, Tanya Bardsley, Lauren Simon, Leanne Brown and Magali Gorre . Becoming frustrated that they wouldn't stop talking about their happy love lives Ampika blurted her revelation to her stunned cast mates. The TV show follows the lives and loves of the six woman, Ampika is the odd one out of the bunch as being single she is not technically a 'housewife'. This isn't the first romance of Ampika's that hasn't gone quite as she'd hoped though. Her marriage to multi-millionaire businessman Mark Pickston, 54, with whom she had a son, Jake, eight, lasted just two years. They split when she was 30. She describes the process of coming out of the union - which she ended - as difficult, along with adjusting to single life. 'It was quite hard and I had to change a lot of the people that I went out with because when I was married it was always couples,' she said. 'I needed to find myself again and almost change my friends because I wasn't going to dinner parties any more, I wasn't going on couple weekends away. It was a whole life changing experience for me. 'I lost myself and I needed to find myself. I'd been with someone since the age of 18 and I didn't know who I was. 'By the time you get to 30 you change massively as a woman and who you are and what you want and you evolve.' In a shot from the show Ampika drinks champagne in the bath showing off her lavish Cheshire lifestyle . Two years on and Ampika is more settled, she has a successful beauty business which has been open for just over a year and she's just started a second building business. She and Mark are close and he's even appeared alongside her on the show. Ampika does admit there have been moments where she has doubted whether she made the right decision to end it, but she's proud the pair have remained friends. She says: 'It's really important because at the end of the day once upon a time we did love each other and, as much as that relationship has changed and we're no longer intimate, I don't think the love ever really dies. 'There's always going to be that love for one another and because we've got a child  it's logical that we get on so that Jake doesn't lose out - the only people that lose out in an acrimonious split are the children and I never wanted that to happen to our son.' Ampika wears a glamorous blue gown, she has revealed to FEMAIL that she thinks it is important to maintain her glamorous look at all times . Ampika dotes on Jake and revealed that he, like most school-children would, has been revelling in his newfound fame after briefly appearing in the show. 'He's always telling his classmates to remember to turn on to the show, even though they're too young to watch it,' she said. What kind of man it would take to tame Ampika, who refers to herself as a 'snake' in the opening credits of RHOC? 'I'd like someone who is loyal and faithful, that's the number one condition,' she said. 'The biggest draw for me would be someone who would love my son and accept my son as well so it wasn't just a relationship about him and myself there's also a third person involved there. 'Likewise, if my future partner had children I would welcome his children into my life as well with open arms. 'Because I'm a successful businesswoman as well, I'd like someone who is ambitious and successful like myself because they I would feel that we're equal.' Ampika revealed she works hard to stay groomed and always wears a full face of make-up . If there's one thing the Real Housewives of Cheshire stars are known for it's their ability to look glamorous at all times. Even when they're in the gym these women are rocking big hair, full make-up and only the most stylish of work out gear. Ampika tells us that for her looking super-groomed has always been a priority: 'I'm a bit of a perfectionist so I like to be well dressed, suited and booted everyday. 'I'm presenting myself to the world so I always make sure I have been to the gym, I have a full face of make-up on. 'I'm very well presented, I like to make sure that my nails are manicured and my hair's done. 'I'm blessed because that's the line of work that I'm in and, having a business that's open seven days a week, I never have a crisis that something's not been done. 'I always keep on top of myself to make sure I'm maintained and groomed to the best of my ability.' Ampika, who enjoys CACI and Skinbreeze facials says that her favourite brand of make-up is the HD Brows collection started by Nilam Holmes-Patel. She said: 'I love HD brows, we have the range here. I invested in the whole thing. I fell in love with the colours, I fell in love with the lady who started it.' But now she's on the television, does she feel under pressure to look good all the time? 'I don't look at it that I'm under pressure from other people but I put myself under pressure myself. I know at the end of the day I can be the best person I can be and if I don't keep it up then the only person I'm letting down is myself.' Does she want more children in the future? '110 per cent yes, I definitely want to have more children. I don't have dreams of having a huge family but to go through that whole thing again marriage, the engagement and the baby. That's the dream.' She's also in the strange situation of receiving prank calls from 'fans', an experience she described as 'quite strange, it's surreal.' She added: 'On one hand it's nice because they've watched the show and they want to get to know you and on the other hand it's quite surreal because I've gone from being a woman in Cheshire who very few people know to being on a national and very successful show.' But would she date a fan? 'I haven't thought about it, I suppose if I'd like them I wouldn't pooh-pooh it, they'd have to be a bit of a fan or they wouldn't like me!'","RHOC star beauty salon owner Ampika Pickston reveals she is single .

"An Oxford University student who claims she was raped by another undergrad after playing a drinking game, says she was 'ignored' and pressured into dropping the charges. Writing under an assumed name, the student known as 'Maria Marcello' says she was raped in  her second year after passing out in her own bed due to the effects of alcohol. She claims that the man bragged about it at dinner the next day, but police pressured her into dropping the charges and advised her to drink less in the future. Writing under the name 'Maria Marcello', the Oxford university student says she was raped in her sleep . The student also slammed Judge Mary Jane Mowat's controversial comments which suggested  the rape conviction rate would not improve until women stopped drinking so heavily. Ms Marcello said: 'Judge Mowat's recent comments about rape convictions are outrageous, but to me they are also personal. 'I was raped while passed out in my bed. Yes, my unconsciousness was due to alcohol. 'Poker rapidly descended into a drinking game and I, being a fatal combination of bad at poker and intolerant of alcohol, passed out. I have since learnt that I was put to bed, but I don't remember anything. Then a guy I didn't know had sex with me in my sleep. 'I have one very clear memory which still haunts me two years later. Marcello slammed Judge Mary Jane Mowat's suggestion that the rape conviction rate would not improve 'until women stop getting so drunk' 'I remember waking up during the night and seeing him on top of me, my trousers around my ankles and my shirt still on. I pulled away and heard him mutter 'Oh no, it fell out' to himself, at which point I blacked out again. I assume he continued to rape me.' She says that when she plucked up the courage to go to the police station, a receptionist insisted that she gave the details of the rape in front of everyone in the waiting room. Two officers then came to her house, where she was questioned further. She said: 'One described rape as 'just something that happens', especially at university. The only advice I received was to drink less in future.' Ms Marcello then claims she was forcefully questioned by a woman who concluded that because she was drunk she would not be able to prove anything in court. 'The woman insisted on me deciding whether or not to press charges immediately,' she said. 'Still shaken and vulnerable, I was in no position to make such a decision on the spot, and frankly her description of the court process scared me. It was little wonder, then, that I dropped it. The president of the Oxford Union, Ben Sullivan, 21, was cleared of rape allegations in June this year . 'I was not allowed to leave the kitchen until I had made my decision. She didn't fail to emphasise how traumatic I would find the process or her certainty my case would not stand up in court: I would be unable to prove I was unconscious at the time or that I didn't drunkenly consent.' The female officer allegedly said that there was not enough evidence, even though photos and videos had been taken of her by  friends which showed her unconscious on the floor and bed. Ms Marcello said: 'Had the police cared enough they could have acquired DNA, but the woman told them to return the clothes, bedsheets and used condoms I had given them. 'These all provided incontrovertible evidence that the guy had sex with me. In fact, given his bragging at dinner the following day, this was never really in question. 'I lost the poker,' he said, 'but I did pretty well if you know what I mean. Just typing that today sickens me.' The Sexual Offences Act 1956 lists 'evidence that by reason of drink, the complainant was unaware of what was occurring and/or incapable of giving valid consent' as a means by which to establish rape. A spokeswoman from Thames Valley Police said: 'If a person if unhappy with the service they have received then we would invite them to make an official complaint to our quality of service department. All the details are on the website.' Ms Marcello says that she was largely 'ignored' by the welfare officers at her college at Oxford University . The student says that when she spoke to the welfare staff at her Oxford college she was largely ignored and her alleged attacker received a minor reprimand and no further repercussions. She said: 'My Oxford college, when I spoke to its professional welfare staff, largely ignored me. 'Despite several friends explaining on multiple occasions that his mere presence unnerved me, he seemed to devote his life to making me feel uncomfortable. On nights I was working behind the college bar, he would carefully place himself between me and the exit, sitting there all night. 'One time when I left a party as soon as he came in he followed me all the way out of college. I ran, and made it halfway back to my house before stopping. Whether his behaviour was intentional is irrelevant: I spent as little time in college as I could, rarely attending events there. 'I have contacted the welfare officers about this, but they have largely ignored me except to say that if he’s around I should just leave. I have a year left at Oxford, as does he. I still don’t understand why I should be the one leaving.' A spokesman for Oxford University said: 'Sexual harassment and violence of any kind is unacceptable at Oxford. When such incidents do occur, our culture is one of strong support for victims, including guidance and advice on making complaints.' Judge Mowat's comments sparked outrage after suggesting that women should not get drunk in order to protect themselves from being raped. The Oxford-educated judge said: 'It is an inevitable fact of it being one person's word against another and the burden of proof being that you have to be sure before you convict. 'I will also say, and I will be pilloried for saying so, but the rape conviction statistics will not improve until women stop getting so drunk.' In response to this Ms Marcello said: 'Mowat is right in that rape conviction statistics are lower than they should be. However, the criminal justice system is to blame, not drunk women.' In Oxford, only 24 per cent of rape trials result in conviction, according to the latest figures. The president of the Oxford Union, Ben Sullivan, 21, was cleared of rape allegations in June this year and has called for the right of anonymity for those accused of similar claims. He was on bail for six weeks after being arrested over claims he raped one fellow student and attacked another.","Oxford student Maria Marcello was raped after playing a drinking game .

"Natasha Leggero, the comic who was slammed as 'disgusting' for making a joke that World War II veterans are so old they are only able to chew SpaghettiOs during NBC's New Year's Eve coverage, says she is not sorry for the jab that created controversy for the TV network. The 31-year-old comedian angered some audience members during NBC's 'New Year's Eve With Carson Daly' when she made an offhand remark in regard to a tasteless tweet that SpaghettiOs had posted on Pearl Harbor Day. 'I mean, it sucks that the only survivors of Pearl Harbor are being mocked by the only food they can still chew,' Leggero quipped. Deluged in angry Tweets, most of which can't be published, Leggero responded in a post on her blog on Friday, reported the New York Daily News. 'I'm not sorry,' she wrote. See the video below.. Cruel: Natasha Leggero, right, appeared on Carson Daly's New Year's Eve show and joked that Pearl Harbor survivors are now so old they can only eat SpaghettiOs because they're soft . 'I don't think the amazing courage of American veterans and specifically those who survived Pearl Harbor is in any way diminished by a comedian making a joke about dentures on television.' 'Do we really believe that the people who fought an defended our freedom against Nazis an the Axis powers will find a joke about SpaghettiO's too much to bear? Sorry, I have more respect for veterans than to think their honor can be impugned by a glamorous, charming comedian in a fur hat.' Leggero pointed to issues with care of veterans as a larger issue than her remark. 'On the one hand you have me, making a joke about how old people can't chew tough foods very well,' she wrote. 'On the other hand you have Veterans who receive inadequate care upon their return from active duty, rampant sexual assault against female soldiers, staggering rates of suicide, traumatic brain injury, PTSD, substance abuse and depression among soldiers and political gridlock that prevents these problems from getting solved quickly.' 'Where do you think your outrage and action would be better served, calling me a c-t or doing something about the above problem?' Leggero concluded. The drama started when Spaghetti0s tweeted a pictured of their mascot holding an American flag and asking people to . 'take a moment to remember #PearlHarbor with us' - which some saw as a . tasteless marketing ploy. Oops: Leggero's comment came as the guests spoke about an insensitive tweet that SpaghettiOs had sent out on Pearl Harbor Day . 'It offended a lot of people, corporations glomming on to, you know, . sentimental American historic traditions, seemingly looking for people . in business. It wasn't good. But you were offended for another reason,' Daly said. 'I'm offended because they were referring to SpaghettiOs as pasta,' said Jane Lynch. Leggero then added: 'It sucks that the only survivors of Pearl Harbor are being mocked by the only food they can still chew.' After Leggero mocked the veterans, Anthony Anderson whooped with laughter - and couldn't stop. As the segment aired, viewers were not impressed. 'Natasha . Leggero just made a joke about the SpaghettiOs Pearl Harbor tweet that . was probably more offensive than the tweet itself,' one viewer wrote on . Twitter. 'Making fun of Pearl Harbor vets? Changing channel. Disgusting. Really NBC?' another said. One other viewer added on the network's Facebook page: 'Shame on you, NBC, for making fun of the WWII vets.' Attack: After Leggero, pictured, made the comment, viewers slammed NBC across social networking sites . Having a laugh: The other guests, especially actor Anthony Anderson, left, found her comment hilarious. Glee favorite Jany Lynch said what she found more offensive was SpaghettiOs being deemed 'a pasta' After SpaghettiOs' insensitive tweet last month, the company issued an apology.

"The man who runs the Sherlock Holmes Museum has launched a bizarre investigation to try to clear a notorious murderer. John Aidiniantz has spent thousands of pounds – made from tourists at the museum – on preparing an appeal for the man who murdered Dr Lin Russell and her daughter Megan and left her other little girl, Josie, for dead. Drug addict Michael Stone attacked Lin, 45, and Megan, six, in a quiet Kent country lane in 1996. Stone, now 53, was convicted after a fellow prisoner said he had confessed to him. Battle: John Aidiniantz, left, claims the conviction of killer Michael Stone, right, would horrify Sherlock Holmes . But Mr Aidiniantz believes the real killer is Levi Bellfield, 45 – the man who murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler. He has set up a so-called ‘justice department’ in the ‘spirit’ of Sherlock Holmes, aimed at overturning miscarriages of justice, and is preparing evidence for the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which refers cases for appeal. The armchair detective, who runs the museum at Holmes’s fictional address of 221B Baker Street in London, said: ‘The trial and conviction of Michael Stone would have caused the author of the Sherlock Holmes stories to choke on his pipe. Victims: Lin and Megan Russell were found dead on a country lane in Kent in 1996 . ‘We are in touch with Michael and he is . delighted that someone is taking an interest in his case. But this is . not about exonerating people. This is about catching the perpetrator. ‘This is what Sherlock Holmes did in the books. He was a forerunner of forensics to solve a case – and that’s how to solve the Michael Stone case, using forensics and not listening to the gossip. You have got to look at the DNA rather than gossip of prisoners. There is no DNA from Michael Stone on the big long lace, used to strangle Megan. ‘The DNA doesn’t lie and it rules out Michael Stone. We need the case to be looked at again.’ For Lin Russell’s surviving daughter, Josie, now 23, who has gone on to rebuild her life, it raises the upsetting prospect of having the whole case dragged through the courts once again. Two juries, one at a retrial in 2001, found Stone guilty of the murders and in 2010 the CCRC rejected Stone’s efforts to have his case  reheard once more. Last year the museum spent £10,000 on a legal challenge to try to get Kent Police to disclose DNA evidence which Mr Aidiniantz believes will open up the case. But a judge refused the request, saying it was nothing more than a ‘fishing expedition’ that would not come ‘within a mile’ of casting doubt on Stone’s guilt. He added that Josie and her father Shaun deserved ‘finality’. Other forensic investigations funded by the museum have already borne fruit. Omar Benguit who was jailed in 2005 for murdering a Korean student has had his conviction been sent back to the Court of Appeal. Mr Aidiniantz gathered the funds earned from his museum in Baker Street dedicated to the character . Mr Aidiniantz is no stranger to controversy. He was sued by his 86-year-old mother Grace last year over control of nearly £2 million of ticket and gift shop receipts from the museum. Mrs Aidiniantz helped set up the museum in 1999. She took the  claim to the High Court after family members raised concerns about missing funds. But last night Mr Aidiniantz told The Mail on Sunday he had settled the case with his mother and that they were now on good terms.","John Aidiniantz spent thousands on appeal for drug addict Michael Stone .

"A pair of German DJs have had saline injected into their chests in a bid to discover what life as a woman is really like. John and Rasheed, who are famous in Germany for their strange stunts, had 700ml of saline injected into their chests to create breasts that would last 24 hours. The pair, who work for Jam FM, visited surgeon Mark Wolter, in Germany, for the temporary boob job that took an hour to complete. Scroll down for video . What a lovely pair: German DJ's John and Rasheed go bra shopping for their new fake boobs . Undergoing the 'op': Jam FM DJ John prepares to have 700ml of saline pumped into his chest . Video courtesy of Jam.FM . As he prepared for the procedure Rasheed said: 'Mum, I'm sorry', while John brought his wife with him for moral support and to supply him with bikinis. Despite the dangers of bruising and inflammation the pair remained undeterred as both men opted for a C cup and even managed to joke around on the 'operating' table. Although their fake bosoms initially felt hard and unnatural, within a few hours they were as soft as the real deal. Embarking on an 'If I Were a Boy' Beyonce-style bucket list, the two men took to social media to share a few bra-clad selfies the before going bra shopping, hitting the gym and trialing their bouncy new body parts by using a skipping rope. The beginning of the breast: Surgeon Mark Wolter inserts the needle into John's pectoral muscle . Preparing the pecs: Rasheed mentally readies himself as surgeon Mark Wolter cleans the area for injection . Surgeon's marks: Rasheed's pectoral muscles were outlined before they were injected with saline to create his bouncy new body parts . The real deal?: Rasheed's new asset is given a firm squeeze to test whether it's the real deal. The breasts started off hard but soon softened to feel more natural . What are you looking at?: John tries on a bra for size. Both men opted for a C cup . As they proudly showed off their new assets to the world, the men also found themselves the centre of attention - among other men. By the end of the day, the men said they had a new understanding of how it feels to be a woman - even if not every part was good. John said having his chest stared at all the time made him feel small and the pair concluded: 'Bras are torture and every woman should get a medal for wearing this monster.' The perks of the job: Rasheed grabs his perky new breasts as the pair joke around in the fitting rooms of a lingerie shop . Give 'em a squeeze: As the pair premiered their new boobs passers by couldn't help but give them a squeeze . If I Were a Girl: The pair reflect on their experience, saying bras are 'torture' and all women deserve medals . The procedure the German DJs underwent to see what it's really like to be a girl is also available in the UK and is fast becoming a popular choice with the wealthy flat-chested. Dubbed 'vacation breasts' and 'party boobs', the beauty treatment that will only last long enough for a day at the beach or a night out. Cosmetic specialist Dr Neetu Nirdosh, who is based in Harley Street, London, offers the 24 hour boob lift and she said it's been popular with her celebrity clients who want to have larger breasts for a red carpet event. She told MailOnline how it works: 'Saline is injected into the breast tissue to give a very temporary breast enlargement. Within minutes a woman can go from a size A to C cup, but within hours the effect fades. 'The saline is essentially salty water so the body's metabolic system will get rid of it within 24 hours. 'It is not directly medically harmful, however you have to tread with caution with sodium based water as it may effect electrolyte balance in the body, so it is not wise to have several of these procedures close together. 'Being water based, it spreads so it has a diffuse reaction of breast swelling.' She added: 'Women must understand that they are paying for a procedure that will flatten very rapidly. 'It can be suitable pre-wedding, before parties, a day on the beach or red carpet events. As women are moving away from the idea of invasive breast augmentation due to recent scandal against PIP implants, and looking for non surgical alternatives, this can provide a realistic option to see what a surgical breast enhancement would look like.' Dr Nirdosh warns though, if you are going to wake up next to a new boyfriend who is not familiar with your boob size, then they may be shocked that your breasts have shrunk in the morning.","Jam FM DJs John and Rasheed both opted for a C cup .

"Race row: TV Presenter Richard Hammond has angered travellers with his use of the word 'pikey' Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond has been embroiled in a race row after he used the word 'pikey' in a magazine column. An Irish traveller group slammed the 42-year-old television presenter and journalist, saying the word was the equivalent of calling a black person a 'n*****'. Hammond used the word in his regular column in this month's Top Gear magazine while writing about how much money he had spent on his Land Rover. He wrote: 'I have, over the 10 years I've owned it, spent way too much money on my Land Rover. I've documented on this page before some of the car's many stages of evolution. 'It's spent time as a blinged-up street cruiser with chrome wheels, blue neon underlighting, straight-through dragster sidepipes and a pumped-up stereo that could damage your pelvis on loud. 'A lot of my little touches have been fun, innocent and pretty harmless. I have fitted chromed accents on the dash and commissioned back seats bearing my daughter's names. 'Yes, I am a pikey, and it is important that my Land Rover reflect that.' A spokesman for the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain said: 'He has to understand that pikey is the equivalent to the n word. 'You could make a joke with the n word in but if you did it wouldn't be funny. It would be offensive. It is the same with pikey.' Top Gear magazine's editor Charlie Turner said: 'We're sorry this term has caused offence. That was never the intention.' Pikey is a highly-offensive word to Irish travellers and gypsies, who consider it derogatory, and its use has landed other celebrities in hot water. Four years ago Formula One commentator Martin Brundle used the word in a television broadcast and ITV had to apologise to viewers after complaints. Favourite wheels: Hammond used the word in this month's Top Gear magazine while writing about how much money he had spent on his Land Rover (above) The term 'pikey' can be traced as far back as the 16th Century when it was derived from the word pike, which meant a road on which a toll is collected. As such, it is strongly associated with a transient lifestyle. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, its first use in print was in the Times in 1837 to refer to strangers who had come to the Isle of Sheppey island to harvest. Later that century, it meant a 'turnpike traveller' or vagabond. In 1847, the Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words recorded the use of 'pikey' to mean a gypsy for the first time. In more recent years, however, it has become a term of abuse and can been deemed a racist offence, given its association with Irish travellers and Roma Gypsies. The previous year celebrity chef Marco Pierre White used the word on ITV's Hell's Kitchen amid another race storm. Hammond . himself has previously been accused of racism after he made an . insulting parody of Mexicans to describe a Mexican sports car. He suggested the vehicle reflected the national characteristics of people from its country of origin - to wit, ‘a lazy, feckless, flatulent oaf with a moustache, leaning against a fence asleep, looking at a cactus, with a blanket with a hole in the middle as a coat’. He also described Mexican food as ‘refried sick’. Co-presenter James May ventured it was ‘like sick with cheese on it’. Clarkson predicted they would not get any complaints, suggesting that the Mexican ambassador would be holding a remote-control and snoring in front of the TV. But the Mexican ambassador, Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza, was furious. He described the comments as 'offensive, xenophobic and humiliating' and the BBC was forced to deliver a personal apology.

"Reports of crimes involving Facebook and Twitter - such as posting abusive messages, grooming and complaints of stalking - have increased eight-fold in four years. In 2008, a total of 556 complaints were . made to police, according to the statistics released by 29 police forces . in a Freedom of Information request. But the phenomenon of social networking . crime has grown substantially and last year 4,908 offences were reported . in which the two sites were a factor. The figures show 653 people were charged for social networking crime in 2011 alone. Scroll down for video . Huge increase: Reports of crime involving Facebook and Twitter rose 780 per cent in just four years . Landmark case: Paul Chambers's conviction for sending a menacing communication under the Communications Act, after posting a tweet saying he would blow up Robin Hood Airport was over-turned in February . Sensible approach: Chief Constable Andy Trotter said forces should prioritise crimes that cause genuine harm . Police forces said there has been a wide variety of offences via the social media platforms, with harassment and menacing messages among the most common. Greater Manchester Police charged the highest number of people, at 115. Lancashire Police received reports of six threats of murder and there were numerous sexual offences as well as allegations of racially aggravated conduct and reports of fraud. Civil liberties campaigners said the . statistics demonstrate how some police forces had 'lost all proportion' in dealing with social media complaints. They added that the figures reveal how poorly some police forces have dealt with complaints about comments made online. Nick Pickles, director of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'These figures show just how badly some police forces had lost all proportion when dealing with social media. 'So many arrests was clearly undermining freedom of speech and while the new guidance should reduce the problem, hundreds of people now have criminal records for the rest of their lives when it is far from clear they should do. 'The law around speech crimes is still in need of a total overhaul as the legislation that led to some of the more absurd prosecutions remains in place.' Chief Constable Andy Trotter, the . Association of Chief Police Officers’ lead on communications, said . forces must prioritise crimes which cause genuine harm, rather than . attempting to curb freedom of expression. Paul Chambers's conviction for joking . on Twitter about blowing up Robin Hood Airport in South Yorkshire was one of the most high profile social networking crime cases in recent years. Mr Chambers tweeted ‘Robin Hood Airport is closed. You’ve . got a week and a bit to get your s*** together otherwise I am blowing . the airport sky high!!’ when it was closed because of snow. Jailed: Nine people were ordered to pay the woman raped by footballer Ched Evans, pictured, £624 for naming her on Twitter or Facebook . He was convicted in May 2010 of sending a menacing communication under the Communications Act, when an airport security official saw the tweet five days later. Mr Chambers was supported by the likes of Al Murray and Stephen Fry during his appeal and his conviction was eventually over turned at the High Court in February. Since then the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) set a 'high threshold' for police intervention in social . networking crime intervention, which is expected to result in fewer . criminal charges being brought. Director of public prosecutions Keir . Starmer QC announced the new guidelines on how people who post offensive . messages on Facebook and Twitter should be dealt with. Mr Starmer admitted the CPS made the wrong 'judgement call' in the Chambers case. He said: 'In most cases, once you have put the (new) safeguards in place . then a prosecution is unlikely to be the appropriate response. 'To that extent, therefore, it is to make it less likely that these cases will be prosecuted.' Other . high-profile cases involving social media include nine people who were each ordered to pay compensation to a woman raped by Ched Evans who they named on Twitter or Facebook. Mr Trotter said social media poses new challenges for police. Total number of complaints and charges from 29 forces . 2008 - 556 complaints and 46 charges . 2011 - 4,908 complaints and 653 charges . Greater Manchester Police charged 115 people this year - the most in the country . Gloucestershire Police only charged five people from 27 complaints . Northern Constabulary received 700 complaints - more than any other force that replied . Lincolnshire Police charged 54 people this year from 579 complaints. In 2008 just one person was charged from 19 complaints . He . said: 'It is a new world for all and we could end up in a situation . where each constabulary needs a dedicated Twitter squad. In my opinion, . that would not be a good use of resources in difficult financial times. 'We need to accept that people have . the right to communicate, even to communicate in an obnoxious or . disagreeable way, and there is no desire on the part of the police to . get involved in that judgment. 'But . equally, there are many offences involving social media such as . harassment or genuine threats of violence which cause real harm. It is . that higher end of offending which forces need to concentrate on.' Police forces that responded to a . Freedom of Information request said 653 people faced criminal charges . this year over allegations involving the two sites that included posting . abusive messages ad crimes that were provoked by postings such as . violent attacks. Four years ago just 46 people were charged. Tayside . Police received 66 reports involving the sites this . year, 44 of these involved sending obscene or menacing messages and in . Merseyside 21 of the 76 crimes reported this year involved harassment. Other notable cases that have caused fierce debate about freedom of speech include that of Reece Messer, 17, who was given an official warning for 'offensive' tweets he posted about diver Tom Daley. Last month, Linford House, 19, was arrested after complaints were made about a tweet in which he was seen burning a Poppy. He was arrested by Kent Police but did not face prosecution for the picture, which he published in the early hours of Remembrance Sunday. Mr Trotter said . offences involving social media can be roughly divided between crimes which would have been . committed, albeit in a different way, before the emergence of social . media and those which exist because of the online platform. 'There is an issue of public expectation,' he said. 'We have to respect free speech and cannot have police forces responding simply because of public outcry. 'In . many ways, online communities can be self-regulating and good at . weeding out unacceptable behaviour. We need to find a way of . distinguishing between that type of behaviour and that which requires . police intervention.'","Crimes include posting menacing messages, and sexual offences such as grooming .

"Just in time for the holidays, a Louisiana judge ruled on Thursday that a woman had a . right to offer her neighbors an unusual seasons greeting by hanging Christmas . lights on her house shaped like a middle finger. Sarah Childs was in a dispute with some of her neighbors in . Denham Springs, just east of Baton Rouge, so she decided to send a message with . her decorations. Neighbors complained and police threatened to arrest her, . so she teamed up with the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana and sued . the city. Christmas may be over, but Sarah Henderson wants to continue with her 'rude' lighting display to get her own back a neighbor . Henderson now says the display was a message to a neighbor who she believes stole her dog . ‘I imagine it will be back up before too long,’ ACLU of . Louisiana executive director Marjorie Esman said of the display. Childs put up the lights on her roof last month. She has . removed them twice since - once after a police officer told her she could be . fined and again after another officer threatened to arrest her, her lawsuit . said. U.S. District Judge James Brady issued an order temporarily . barring city officials from interfering with the display. The two-page order . said the city's ‘continued efforts’ to prevent Childs from displaying her . holiday lights will violate her rights to free speech and due process. Denham Springs attorney Paeton Burkett said the city will . comply with Brady's order, but she declined to comment on the lawsuit. ‘We're going to sit down with everybody involved and see if . there's any merit to it,’ she said. Mayor Jimmy Durbin and Police Chief Scott Jones, who are . named as defendants, didn't immediately respond to calls seeking comment. The suit said the police department dispatched an officer . to Childs' home after several neighbors complained directly to the mayor. The officer told Childs she would be violating the city's ‘obscenity . statute"" and could be fined if she didn't take it down, according to the . lawsuit. However, Denham Springs doesn't have an obscenity statute, the suit . said. Childs removed the lights but put them back up after the . ACLU defended her in an open letter to the city. That time, the display showed . two hands with extended middle fingers. After another round of complaints, the city responded with . a ‘collateral attack,’ issuing her two tickets, according to the suit. One . accused her of obstructing the flow of traffic as she walked down the side of a . street. Another ticket accused her of disturbing the peace while . singing an impromptu song about her neighborhood dispute while standing in her . driveway. Henderson has twice removed the lights from her roof, but with the support of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana she is attempting to sue the city, its mayor and police . ‘Childs' impromptu song allegedly contained some . obscenities directed at her neighbors, so the city cited her for simple . assault,’ the suit said. The lawsuit filed . suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana in . Baton Rouge seeks an injunction, damages and attorney's fees. The ACLU would not say exactly what the neighborhood . dispute was about, and a no one answered at a telephone listing for Childs. 'This is a victory . for the First Amendment and the rule of law,' said Margorie Esman, . executive director for the ACLU of Louisiana. A hearing on Childs’ request for a preliminary injunction will be held on January 7. Childs, a mother of four . children aged between 4 and 16,  admits she deliberately fashioned her . light display to look like a human hand ‘flipping the bird’. She said the middle finger salute was a message to some of her neighbors . whom she has been involved in a year-long dispute with. 'They put themselves into affairs of . mine that they had no business in,’ she told WBRZ. ‘They spread vicious . lies throughout the neighborhood.’ Henderson had initially agreed to . remove the offending display after she received a visit from Denham . Spring Police. Corporal Shawn Perkins informed Henderson that her . display was in violation of obscenity laws and that she faced the . possibility of a $300 or $400 fine. Traditional display: Henderson's neighbor Gemma Rachel said Christmas lights should be something wholesome for children to enjoy . Childs said she could have fought the request, but she decided to take the lights down out of respect for her mayor and city council. One . local neighbor, Gemma Rachel told WBRZ that while she hasn't have . anything personal against Childs, she didn’t think the lights were an . appropriate symbol for young children to be exposed to. ‘Christmas lights should be something for kids to enjoy’ she told WBRZ. Since taking down her lights, Childs has received support from the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. Marjorie Essman, executive director . at the ACLU, has sent a letter to the Denham Springs chief of police . saying the city has no right to restrict Childs' expression purely because it, or Childs' neighbors, finds it vulgar or offensive. In the letter, Esman wrote: 'The . Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeal, which presides over Louisiana, Texas . and Mississippi, has specifically commented on the protected expressive . nature of a middle finger extended in defiance or protest: ""The thumbed . nose, the projected middle finger, the Bronx cheer, the grimace and the . smile are all conduct intended to convey a message that is sometimes . made even more expressive by its bold freedom from a garb of words.""

"Gay marriage is one of several threats to the traditional family unit that undermines 'the future of humanity itself', Pope Benedict XVI warned yesterday. The pontiff told diplomats from nearly 180 countries that the education of proper of children needed proper 'settings' and that 'pride of place goes to the family, based on the marriage of a man and a woman.' The Pope made his comments, some of his strongest yet against gay marriage, during a new year address to the diplomatic corps accredited to the Vatican. New year address: Pope Benedict, pictured arriving for an audience with the diplomatic corps at the Vatican yesterday, where he warned gay marriage is one of several threats to the traditional family unit . During his speech, he touched on some economic and social issues facing the world today, including gay marriage. He said: 'This is not a simple social convention, but rather the fundamental cell of every society. 'Consequently, policies which undermine the family threaten human dignity and the future of humanity itself. The family unit is . fundamental for the educational process and for the development both of . individuals and states. 'Hence there is a need for policies which promote . the family and aid social cohesion and dialogue.' The Vatican and Catholic officials around the world have protested against moves to legalise gay marriage in Europe and other developed parts of the world. One leading opponent of gay marriage in the U.S. is New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan, who the Pope will elevate to cardinal next month. Dolan fought against gay marriage before it became legal in New York state last June, and in September he sent a letter to President Barack Obama criticising his administration's decision not to support a federal ban on gay marriage. In that letter Dolan, who holds the powerful post of president of the U.S. Bishops Conference, said such a policy could 'precipitate a national conflict between church and state of enormous proportions'. The Roman Catholic Church, which has some 1.3billion members worldwide, teaches that while homosexual tendencies are not sinful, homosexual acts are, and that children should grow up in a traditional family with a mother and a father. Gay marriage is legal in a number of European countries, including Spain and the Netherlands. Some Churches that have allowed gay marriage, women priests, gay clergy and gay bishops have been losing members to Catholicism, and the Vatican has taken steps to facilitate their conversion. In 2009, Benedict decreed that Anglicans who leave their Church, many because they feel it has become too liberal, can find a home in Catholicism in a parallel hierarchy that allows them to keep some of their traditions. The Vatican has since set up ""ordinariates,"" structures similar to dioceses, in Britain and the U.S. to oversee ex-Anglicans who have converted and be a point of contact for those wishing to do so.",Pope Benedict XVI was making a new year address to the diplomatic corps accredited to the Vatican .
"A law student’s future lay in ruins yesterday after he admitted sending racist messages on Twitter to former England footballer Stan Collymore. Joshua Cryer, 21, was arrested after the Liverpool striker turned radio pundit contacted police in January. Cryer, the son of a company  director, initially denied sending the messages on the social  networking site, claiming his account had been hacked into. Foolish: Student Joshua Cryer, 21, sent former footballer Stan Collymore a series of racist tweets. He was spared jail this week after appearing at Newcastle Magistrates' Court . But he later admitted sending grossly offensive messages and yesterday was given a two-year community order. The final-year student at Newcastle University’s acclaimed Law School was also told to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work. He had sent the obscene messages to ‘get a rise’ out of the former striker, the court was told. District judge Stephen Earl told Cryer: ‘There will be a dramatic effect on your job and your career. But you put yourself here and you have to man up to that reality. ‘I find it difficult to fathom what on earth you thought you were doing. It was stupid and you ought to have known better.’ Immature: Cryer told police he hoped to gain a reaction from Collymore, pictured, who is a broadcaster for talkSPORT and also campaigns against racism . The judge said he expected Cryer ‘to have put his education to better use’. One message from the student, who captains the law school’s football side Barca-Law-Na, read: ‘Has anyone ever called you Stan ****ymore.’ A second, also sent from user  @joshuacryer1, said: ‘Has anyone ever referred to you as semi pro as in a semi pro ****.’ Collymore, 40, who was capped three times for England and is now a talkSPORT presenter, re-tweeted the posts to his 230,000 followers. He is said to have replied: ‘Not having this crap any more. Joshua, I see you’ve deleted your tweets. I haven’t. Not having it any more, it’s virtually every day now. ‘Two officers from Staffordshire Police have been and they have a statement and evidence. ‘In the process of reporting you to Newcastle Police for racist abuse, which is in contravention of UK law. See you in court.’ The ‘JoshuaCryer1’ account was deleted after the tweets were sent. Cryer’s name and mobile phone number were later posted on  football forums. Veronica Jordan, prosecuting at Newcastle Crown Court, said the tweets were of a ‘racist nature’ and ‘repeated over a number of days’. She added: ‘Cryer appeared to have been boastful, saying: “I have found a new hobby”. ‘He started to cover it up by making false claims that someone had hacked into his account. Once he was arrested, he made a full admission and appeared to be contrite. ‘There was an element of showing off, wanting a response from Mr Collymore to get him to reply.’ Held: Cryer was arrested in January after Collymore reported online abuse to Staffordshire Police . Cryer’s sentencing comes days after biology student Liam Stacey, 21, admitted writing racist tweets after Bolton star Fabrice Muamba, 23, collapsed during an FA Cup tie with heart failure. Disgusted Twitter users, including Collymore, alerted police. The Swansea University student will be sentenced next week for inciting racial hatred. The case comes as police in Strathclyde were investigating  racist Twitter messages sent to two black Rangers FC players. And in November, two teenagers were bailed after Newcastle player Sammy Ameobi claimed he was the victim of racism on the site. Collymore said he has repeatedly faced racist abuse on Twitter and called on the Government to make it clear what is legal. ‘Some people believe freedom of speech means you can say anything to anyone,’ he wrote. ‘You can’t.’","Joshua Cryer, 21, admitted using Twitter .

"Tv star Lorraine Kelly, 54, said woman 'want to look fantastic' Forget thongs and frills, for when it comes to fashion the woman over 50 would far rather hang on to her jeans than fancy lingerie. Comfort rather than style appears to the mantra of the nation’s mature women, who feel high street chains are ignoring them. In fact, women over 50 are emerging as Britain’s most powerful consumer group and they are a hugely lucrative market for the fashion industry with annual sales worth some £6.7billion. Yet a new study says that too often designers and retailers fail to understand them and what they want from clothes. The research, commissioned by retailer JD Williams, found that just 20per cent of mature women feel well catered for on the high street and 61per cent feel that their age group is forgotten. Around one in three said they felt pressured by the big chains to dress younger than their years. And when they were asked about their favourite piece of clothing, a pair of jeans came out top with 15per cent putting it at number one, while just one per cent named lingerie. This might have something to do with the comfort offered by a well cut pair of jeans, for the study found 71per cent rate comfort over style when it comes to fashion. Researchers asked older women which parts of their body they felt most negative about and wanted help with. Top was the stomach at 64per cent, ahead of the upper arms at 35per cent and thighs at 28per cent. Given these findings, it is not surprising that some 57per cent of the women questioned said they would like to lose weight. The study said: ‘Fifty-three per cent of women aged 50+ feel that it can be hard to find clothing that suits them, with 22per cent saying they would like to buy more fashionable clothes but find clothes shopping intimidating. ‘Sixty-six per cent of mature women feel they would like to see more choice from fashion retailers suited to their age group.’ JD Williams has commissioned daytime TV star Lorraine Kelly to create her own collection next year. Earlier this year, she fronted a fashion campaign for the retailer. Jeans, like this pair by Armani, were named the favourite piece of clothing by women over 50 . The 54-year-old said: ‘These women have the spending power and they want to look fantastic, it doesn’t matter what size or age they are, we have neglected them. I know this from my own experience.’ She said she knows many women her age who have struggled to find clothes that flatter a slightly older figure while remaining stylish. ‘Fashion is all about feeling comfortable in your own skin and all of the clothes that I’ve chosen make me feel great,’ she said. The study also asked older women about the advantages and challenges of growing old. Some 22per cent said they were excited about getting a bus pass, which ranked slightly higher than a pension. They were looking forward to more leisure time, having grandchildren and spending time with friends and family. Just 10per cent were worried about getting wrinkles, while 77per cent have ruled out any form of plastic surgery. Angela Spindler, the 52-year-old chief executive of N Brown Group, which owns JD Williams, said: ‘Shopping for clothes should be easy and enjoyable whether you’re 16 or 60. ‘There are more women in the 50+ bracket than ever before and it’s abundantly clear that they have felt let down by the fashion industry. ‘Recent years have seen this population of women emerge as the most powerful consumer group and the fastest growing fashion sector. No longer does 50 signal the start of the slow decline into old age, it now marks the midpoint of a woman’s life. ‘We hope this report heralds a wake-up call to the fashion, retail and media industries to give these women what they want, in the way we do. It’s our job to empower; after all ignoring them should be done with peril.’","Jeans named as the favourite item of clothing for women over 50 .

"An online retailer which was caught selling vulgar Jimmy Savile T shirts has sparked fury by selling a selection of golliwog goods. The items, including T shirts, duvet covers, pillow cases and cushions have been branded as ‘deeply offensive racist paraphernalia’ by campaigners who have urged the site to remove them. The merchandise, which range in price from £1 stickers to the £58 duvet cover, were discovered for sale via on-line community and marketplace Redbubble. T-shirts with golliwog prints in a selection of sizes and colours were being sold on the site for £14.93 . The selection of golliwog goods, including bags, have been branded as ‘deeply offensive racist paraphernalia’ by campaigners who have urged the site to remove the items . Campaigners for racial equality said the golliwog was 'deeply offensive' and should be 'consigned to the dustbin of history' The site caused outrage when it was found last week selling T shirts with paedophile Jimmy Savile on them . Redbubble was also advertising vulgar Jimmy Savile T shirts on its site which glorified the paedophile . Only last week, the site was caught selling T-shirts of paedophile Jimmy Savile with jokey slogans about child abuse. Lee Jasper, a British race relations activist, told MailOnline: ‘It remains an offensive caricature of the African slaves entertaining other slaves on a plantation. ‘It should be consigned to the dustbin of history, as it is deeply offensive. ‘The golliwog character was created at the end of the most vicious period of the 500 years of slavery. ‘The African community are getting tired of seeing it used as a means to make a profit. ‘It is deeply disappointing that we are having this type of discussion in the 21st century.’ The golliwog, with thick lips, unruly black hair and paws is seen as an offensive caricature of black people . Redbubble said they were aware of the controversy around golliwog dolls, but said they only removed dolls which have 'implicit or explicit racist undertones or are used in an offensive manner' The golliwog character was created by Florence Upton in 1895 in her book entitled ‘The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwog’, where it was described as ‘a horrid sight, the blackest gnome’. She clothed her golliwogs with thick lips, unruly black hair and paws instead of hands and feet. After Upton created the golliwog, it became a favourite for collectors and was popular in the UK as the mascot of Robertson’s jam. But by the 1980s, it was increasingly seen as an offensive racist caricature of black people. Robertson’s dropped their golliwog mascot, called Golly, from their labelling in 2001. Chi Onwurah MP, who became Newcastle’s first black MP in 2010, said: ‘Golliwog was one of the most common and most hurtful of the racial insults I faced as a child. ‘I find it amazing that any reputable retailer would seek to make money by promoting this racist stereotype. ‘If they are selling Jimmy Savile T-shirts as well, they clearly see a market opportunity in offending both victims of racial and sexual abuse and they certainly do not deserve to profit from it.’ Adam Afriyie MP said: ‘I am delighted MailOnline are highlighting this issue, which causes concern to so many people.’ The duvet covers with golliwog prints retailed at £58 - campaigners said it was 'completely mistaken' for any company to sell products that 'only promote racist bigotry' The range of golliwog merchandise was described as 'deeply disappointing' by MPs and campaigners . Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote, said: ‘In a free market we have to reluctantly accept this horrible merchandise. ‘This imagery is deeply offensive to the majority of black people. We are in the 21st century and the vast majority of people are acutely aware of the historic and offensive nature of these golliwog dolls with the caricature of black people with bulging eyes and big lips. Adam Afriyie MP said: ‘I am delighted MailOnline are highlighting this issue, which causes concern to so many people' ‘It is deeply offensive to us and our children. ‘Now Redbubble know about this, I would hope they would issue a quick apology and not sell items that deeply offend tens of thousands of people.’ Ian Pattison, from the Youth Against Racism in Europe group, said: ‘Golliwogs and other racist paraphernalia rightly went out of fashion long ago. ‘Today most people are completely opposed to racism, and reject any attempt to return to the divisive attitudes of the past. It is completely mistaken for any company to sell products that only promote racist bigotry.’ In recent years, there have been a number of scandals involving the golliwog character. In February 2009, Carol Thatcher, daughter of Margaret Thatcher, was sacked from her slot on the BBC’s One Show after she made off-air comments comparing French tennis player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to a golliwog. Despite being confronted by presenter Adrian Chiles and other guests, Thatcher refused to apologise and was promptly axed. In March 2011, two prospective Conservative local councillors, Bill and Star Etheridge, a married couple, resigned from the party after their membership was suspended following complaints from fellow party members that they had used images of golliwogs as part of a protest against political correctness. The pair then both defected to the UK Independence Party. In August, Bill Etheridge hit the headlines again, when he described Hitler as a ‘magnetic and forceful public speaker’ who ‘achieved a great deal’ – and said UKIP candidates should copy the rhetorical style deployed by Hitler at the Nuremberg rallies. In 2011 two Conservative councillors, married couple Bill and Star Etheridge posted pictures of them posing with golliwog dolls - they subsequently resigned and defected to UKIP .

"An Iranian athlete refused to shake the Duchess of Cambridge's hand after she presented him with his discus silver medal on Sunday. The Royal was warmly received on the podium by Paralympic GB's gold medal winner Aled Davies and Chinese bronze medallist Lezheng Wang. But when it was Mehrdad Karam Zadeh's turn to step up, the 40-year-old failed to offer a hand to the Duchess, clutching them close to his chest. Scroll down for video . Hot on her heels: Kate Middleton presented the medals to the Men's Discus Throwing winners on Sunday . Briefed: St. James's Palace insists the Duchess was warned not to expect a handshake . His decision not to shake hands with the Duchess was likely to have been a result of Iranian cultural . convention which bans such contact between unrelated men and women. The . Duchess appeared to have been briefed on the situation, because she did . not offer her hand either. The incident threatened to overshadow a glittering night for Paralympics GB, which enjoyed its most successful day of the Games so far with seven gold medals. The Iranian delegation in London have not been available to comment on the incident, but according to the Daily Telegraph, they have told Games organisers Zadeh was not making a political statement. It's believed the athlete was merely conforming to Iranian cultural convention, forbidding men from shaking hands with unrelated women. A spokesman for St. James's Palace has revealed the Duchess was briefed beforehand and warned not to offer her hand to Zadeh. Presentation: The Duchess hands over the medal, left, and Zadeh claps his hands to his chest, right . End of the presentation: The Duchess of Cambridge moves away from the athlete . The Islamic rules about touching apply to Muslims and non-Muslims. A man or a woman is only allowed to shake hands, or have similar contact, with someone of the same sex. However, there are several exceptions for close relatives such as brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, and so on. 'Many male athletes from Islamic countries do not shake hands in public with women they are not related to for cultural and religious reasons,' the palace representative said. The palace added Middleton was 'honoured' to get the chance to present the medals, particularly to a British champion in Davies. It put Paralympic GB in second place in the medal table, with 54 in all. The Iranians have said that had the . medal been presented by a man Zadeh would have shaken his hand. Likewise, had the Duchess presented the medal to a female Iranian they would not have hesitated to shake hands. However, it's not the first time the Iranian custom has caused controversy. Last year the Iranian volleyball team had to apologise after several team members shook hands with a female referee after a game against Afghanistan. The gesture provoked outrage and Iran’s state-owned media described the players' behaviour as 'stunning and inappropriate'. Beaming: The Duchess of Cambridge smiles as she hands the gold medal to Aled Davies of Paralympic GB . Shaking hands: The pair have no such issues as Aled Davies enjoys his moment of glory . Podium: Mehrdad Karam Zadeh poses with gold medallist Aled Davies and third placed Lezheng Wang of China . Earlier on Sunday, Kate cheered with delight as Britain's mixed coxed fours crew - David Smith, James Roe, Naomi Riches, Pam Relph and cox Lily van den Broecke - pulled away from their German rivals and crossed the finish line first at Eton Dorney. In all, there were medals across athletics, rowing, dressage, table tennis, swimming and cycling yesterday – taking the overall total to 16 golds, 24 silver and 14 bronze. It puts Paralympic GB in second place in the medal table, with 54 in all. Mariia Pomazan, Qing Wu from China and Jiongyu Bao from China at the original medal ceremony . The Ukrainian athlete who was ordered to give back her discus gold medal because of a scoring blunder did not turn up to the rearranged ceremony at the Olympic Stadium this morning. Mariia Pomazan stayed away in apparent protest as the gold she had been presented with on Friday was awarded to China's Wu Qing. The 23-year-old was demoted to silver and the place on the podium reserved for the second-placed athlete remained empty. She admitted yesterday she was 'very, very angry' after losing her gold in the F35/36 class, with organisers announcing the wrong medals had been awarded. Points rather than distance determined the final standings in the combined-class event. She revealed those feelings had been behind her shot put gold yesterday. All three athletes who received medals on Friday were asked to return them, with an appeal by the Ukrainian National Paralympic Committee for the original result to stand rejected by the jury of appeal. An International Paralympic Committee spokesman said: 'Since Friday we have tried to investigate if an alternative could be found that suited all parties that was within the rules. This has not been possible.'","Discus thrower Mehrdad Karam Zadeh clutched his chest after he was presented with his silver medal .

"Father-of-two Doyin Richards has opened up about why he believes a picture of him taking care of his daughters became an overnight internet sensation. When the Los Angeles, California resident shared a photo of himself cradling his baby three-month-old girl Reeko in an Ergo while brushing the hair of his other daughter Emmyko, three, he was shocked to discover that it sparked nasty comments about his race. 'I took the ultimate selfie,' he said of the internet's impassioned reaction in a Today show appearance. 'There's race, there's fatherhood. . . there's all types of things that go into it.' Scroll down for video . Big reactions: Father-of-two Doyin Richards has opened up about why he believes a picture of him taking care of his daughters became an overnight internet sensation. 'I took the ultimate selfie,' he said . Talking point: 'There's race, there's fatherhood. . . there's all types of things that go into it,' he said of the innocent photo, which sparked some nasty comments . Explaining how the multi-tasking situation came about, he told the hosts that he was on paternity leave when his wife, who was getting ready for work, didn't have time to do their daughter's hair. 'I said, listen, I've got this. So I put the little one in the Ergo and then I had (my older daughter) come over and I was combing her hair.' he recounted. 'And I thought there's no way my wife is going to believe me. . .  so I took the ultimate selfie.' Little did he know the passionate response he would inspire by posting the photo on his Facebook and Twitter pages. Within hours, the photo had thousands of views, 'likes', shares and comments - some of them from awe-struck fellow parents, and others overwhelmingly negative. Some commenters took issue with the color of his skin, making cruel assumptions about his lifestyle. 'I would bet anything that you're a deadbeat,' one nasty commenter wrote on his blog Daddy Doin' Work, . while another said: 'Cute picture. Now why don't you hand the children . back to their mom so you can go back to selling drugs or your bootleg . rap CDs?' VIDEO: Doyin Richards tlaks to Katie Couric about his viral photo . Internet controversy: When Doyin Richards shared this photo of himself cradling his baby girl in an Ergo while brushing his other daughter's hair, the post went viral, receiving both positive and negative feedback . But many reacted in the same way as Today hosts Al Roker and Carson Daly: complete and utter admiration. Indeed, Mr Roker greeted the doting dad as 'my hero' when he came on, and Mr Daly said jokingly: 'Thanks for setting the bar so high. Now when we can't do something, our wives will just say, ""Well, Doyin does it!""' When he originally posted the photo, some commented on the fact that his . children, who are three months old and three years old in the photo, . don't share his exact same skin color. 'He probably rented those kids. They . don't even look like him,' one commenter said about his daughters, whose . mother Mariko is half-white and half-Japanese. Ignorance: Some critics made offensive remarks about his race, and others commented on the fact that his children, who are half black, a quarter Japanese and a quarter white, don't share his exact same skin color . Cruel assumptions: 'He probably rented those kids. They don't even look like him,' one commenter said about his daughters, whose mother Mariko (pictured) is half-white and half-Japanese . Surprisingly, Mr Richards notes that . many of the people posting racist comments were actually black men like . himself, who had negative things to say about his mixed-race wife and . daughters. To these people, Mr Richards hit back in a response called 'I Have a Dream' on his . blog. ‘You're a damn embarrassment to Dr King and his legacy.' The . father-of-two added: 'If the first thing you want to do is to criticize . the skin color of my kids for not being as dark as mine, you have some . serious issues.' Despite the negative reactions, Mr . Richards told Katie Couric that he hopes his picture can generate a . conversation about parenthood and a father's role in their child's life. Hitting back: 'Grow up and stop being so f****** ignorant,' he wrote to his critics, many of whom are black men like himself. 'You're a damn embarrassment to Dr King and his legacy' Taking a stand: The devoted father-of-two added: 'If the first thing you want to do is to criticize the skin color of my kids for not being as dark as mine, you have some serious issues' 'We really need to change the narrative on what fatherhood is all about, get more changing tables in men's bathrooms, do all these things to help celebrate the great dads of the world,' he said on her talk show, Katie. 'Enough of the negativity. We need to get the great . dads of the world, and let them know that there's more out there. I'm . just one of many.' His powerful 'I Have a Dream Post' garnered more than 230 comments on his blog, with many of his followers showing their support for him. 'What enrages me about this situation is that it only became a negative situation because you're a non-white dad raising mixed raise kids,' wrote one mother-of-seven from Mississippi. Good parent: 'We really need to change the narrative on what fatherhood is all about, get more changing tables in men's bathrooms, do all these things to help celebrate the great dads of the world,' he said . Backlash: One of his supporters commented: 'I can't believe anyone would look at a picture like this and find a way to take issue with something. Spending time actually raising your kids is a gift' 'The photo you posted melted my heart. It drew negative attention because you're not supposed to be a positive influence in their lives,' she wrote. 'You're supposed to be a dead beat. . . because that's what the societal mold would dictate, and they don't know how to process the fact that you don't fit into it.' One fellow doting dad said that he could relate to his dedication to parenting. 'Many fathers relinquish parenting duties to the mother, and take a back seat,' he wrote. 'This was never what I had in mind for my own child.' Another commented: 'I can't believe anyone would look at a picture like this and find a way to take issue with something. Spending time actually raising your kids is a gift for both you and them.'","A photo that Los Angeles, California blogger Doyin Richards posted of himself cradling one daughter in an Ergo while doing the other's hair recently went viral .

"A pair of Twitter trolls who threatened to kill and rape a feminist for campaigning to have Jane Austen on the £10 note were facing jail yesterday. Isabella Sorley, 23, a binge-drinking college graduate, and John Nimmo, 25, a jobless recluse living on benefits, bombarded journalist Caroline Criado-Perez with vile messages threatening her with attacks ‘worse than rape’. The threats started in July last year after the Bank of England revealed that the Pride And Prejudice author would replace Charles Darwin as the face of the £10 note. Scroll down for video . John Nimmo (left), 25, and Isabella Sorley (right), 23, have admitted a charge of sending 'menacing' tweets to 29-year-old student Caroline Criado-Perez . The announcement was hailed as a . ‘brilliant day for women’ by Miss Criado-Perez, who had led a . high-profile campaign on social media to ensure a female face would . remain on banknotes after the Bank dropped social reformer Elizabeth Fry . from the £5 note in favour of Winston Churchill. But days later she began receiving a stream of abuse from 86 Twitter accounts. Sorley, . from Newcastle upon Tyne, has a degree in creative advertising from . Leeds College of Art and is currently said to be working in an Asda . supermarket in Newcastle. But . she deluged Miss Criado-Perez with menacing messages claiming that she . had just been released from prison, writing: ‘I will find you and you . don’t want to know what I will do when I do, you’re pathetic, kill . yourself before I do.’ Caroline Criado-Perez (left) and Stella Creasy MP (right) received the 'menacing' messages after a campaign for more women to be featured on banknotes in July last year was successful . Other . vile messages included: ‘I’ve only just got out of prison and would . happily do more time to see you berried!!’ (sic) and ‘Rape?! I’d do a . lot worse things than rape you!!’ Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution. The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500. Since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet, e-mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge Twitter trolls. Student Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act. Two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster airport 'sky high' was charged under the Communications Act 2003. Sorley later told police she was ‘bored’ and ‘off her face’ with drink at the time. Defence counsel Sean Caulfield said Sorley had an alcohol problem and has 21 convictions for being drunk and disorderly. She received a community order in December after assaulting a police officer and is currently on bail for four other offences. Nimmo, . from South Shields, also abused East London MP Stella Creasy when she . tried to help Miss Criado-Perez, calling her a ‘dumb blonde bitch’. The . troll’s messages to Miss Criado-Perez included: ‘Ya not that gd . looking. To rape u be fine,’ and: ‘Just think it could somebody that . knows you personally. The police will do nothing its only twitter.’ (sic). Westminster magistrates heard that Miss Criado-Perez had suffered ‘life-changing’ psychological effects from the abuse. Prosecutor Alison Morgan said: ‘The messages involved extreme language and caused substantial distress and fear.’ Yesterday both defendants admitted sending by public communications network messages that were menacing in character. District Judge Howard Riddle remanded Sorley in custody, warning she will ‘almost inevitably’ be sent to prison. The banknote announcement was hailed as a 'brilliant day for women' by Ms Criado-Perez who led the high profile campaign . Nimmo was released on bail until January 24, when they will both be sentenced. Following . the hearing, Miss Criado-Perez said: ‘I hope this conviction will be a . warning: online abuse is not consequence-free.’ Police are still investigating a number of other trolls.","John Nimmo and Isabella Sorley admit charge of sending tweets last July .

"Last week her community worked together to transform her house into a winter wonderland for an early Christmas, fulfilling a dying wish. But on Tuesday morning Calianna Griggs, a two-year-old girl from Glendale, Arizona, whose body was riddled with about 40 tumors, succumbed to her battle with adrenal cancer. Her father, Gregg Griggs, posted on the family's GoFundMe page that his daughter died in her parents arms about 1.20am. 'She was sleeping and went peacefully with her mother and I holding her and talking to her,' the post read. 'Thank you everyone for your support through all of this.' Tragic: Calianna Griggs, aged two, passed away early Tuesday from adrenal gland cancer . Cali was diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome and adrenocortical carcinoma in April. Cali's LFS prompted adrenocortical carcinoma, a rare cancer that forms in the outer layer of tissue of the adrenal gland. Despite chemotherapy and multiple surgeries, doctors said she was unlikely to make it to December. A date for Cali's princess-themed memorial has not been set. On Thursday, thanks to dozens of volunteers and donations from the community, Cali got her dying wish. She and her parents were picked up by Santa Claus in a horse-drawn carriage down the street from their home. When it came around the corner, she saw her home transformed. Dying wish: Christmas came early for Cali last week as volunteers transformed her house into a wonderland . Gifts: Santa, elves and even Minnie Mouse was on hand to ensure Cali's final Christmas was special . Love: Cali passed away in the arms of her parents, Ashley and Greg Griggs, on Tuesday . Part of the wonderland featured a tent with Minnie Mouse, Cali's favorite character, and gifts for the toddler. Her father Greg Griggs told AZ Central: 'She just wanted to get out and play with everything. 'And I had to fight it, I was about to cry.' Volunteers filled the yard with decorations and blanketed the house with lights - which will stay up for the entire holiday season. The local fire department and J Barry Designs spent hours making snow that covered the lawn - and despite it taking all day, it was worth it when Cali enjoyed a snowball fight with her father. Magical: Volunteers worked all day to put up lights and decorations to fulfil the two-year-old's dying wish . Ho ho ho: No Christmas would be complete with a visit from Santa and his elves . All smiles: The transformation was possible after thousands of dollars was raised in donations . A couple of weeks ago, Cali's family said her doctor gave her one to three months to live and desperate for her not to miss Christmas, they said they planned to stage it early. The genetic syndrome she has, which affects fewer than 500 people in the world, has created the rare cancer and given her more than 30 tumors on her lungs, one on her adrenal gland, another in her belly and one on her spine. Despite undergoing intense chemotherapy twice and multiple surgeries, doctors at the hospital in West Valley, Arizona, told her parents, childhood sweethearts Greg and Ashley Gonzalez, that she had between one and three months left. 'Calianna is our precious little angel, she is so sweet and deserves a chance to be with us a little longer,' her mother said. Last wish: Her parents Greg Griggs and Ashley Gonzalez hope to make her last Christmas the most special . Diagnosed: This is Cali in the early stage of her cancer last spring, when she grew three dress sizes in 10 days . 'We want her last Christmas to be the best and we also want for her funeral service to be very special.' Mr Griggs was tearful as he told MailOnline: 'She is in a world of pain that I couldn't even imagine. 'It is just getting harder and harder and harder.' The couple noticed something was wrong when Cali ballooned from aged two clothes to aged five clothes in just 10 days. The swelling continued and Cali was increasingly lethargic. In a recent local TV interview, Mr Griggs broke down in tears as he heard the microphone picking up Cali struggling to breathe. 'It was just too much. She finds it so difficult. Sometimes now she just sleeps for hours at a time.' Fun: Cali loved playing dress up games with her family . Before the child's death, her mother updated family and friends of Cali's condition in a heartbreaking post on GoFundMe. 'She is so swollen now and her tummy is as hard as a rock,' Mrs Griggs wrote. 'But the saddest part is she is struggling to breathe now. 'I am scared to fall asleep every night because I'm afraid she will stop breathing in the middle of the night.' In a matter of days, the donations on the family's GoFundMe page increased from $4,000 to over $30,000. Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a disorder that affects a handful of people worldwide. It stems from mutations of either the TP53 gene or CHEK2 gene, which normally act as tumor suppressors by controlling the growth and division of cells. When mutated, it allows cells to multiply, grow and divide in and out-of-control nature, making sufferers more susceptible to cancer, especially leukaemia, brain and breast cancer. In many cases, one of the sufferer's relatives will have had a cancer that displays similar characteristics. Cali's LFS prompted adrenocortical carcinoma, a rare cancer that forms in the outer layer of tissue of the adrenal gland. The gland is a small organ on top of each kidney that makes steroid hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline to control heart rate, blood pressure and other body functions. The disease, which affects up to just two million people a year, has a five-year survival rate of 20-35 per cent. Symptoms include hair growth, weight gain, a lump in the stomach or back of the head, muscle weakness and high blood pressure.

"A vicar who complained about 'blasphemous' comments made by Jeremy Clarkson has been told by the BBC that 'offensive language is just a part of everyday life'. The Rev Graeme Anderson said he was 'surprised and upset' after the Top Gear presenter shouted 'Jesus wept' and 'God Almighty' during a show on March 4. The 52-year-old has vowed never to watch the motoring programme again after receiving an 'unsatisfactory' response from the broadcaster, which claimed 'there is no consensus about words that are acceptable'. 'Offensive': The Rev Graeme Anderson, left, said Jeremy Clarkson had 'trivialised, belittled and cheapened' his faith . No apology: Clarkson's comments were made in a episode of Top Gear that aired on March 4. He shouted 'Jesus wept' while driving a KTM X-bow open stop sports car in the rain from his home in London . 'Double standards': The BBC told Rev Anderson that Clarkson's words are 'a part of everyday language' Mr Anderson, of St Mary's church, in Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I thought Top Gear was great before this. 'But I found Jeremy Clarkson's comments very offensive and I think many Christians would. 'They belittled, trivialised and . cheapened Jesus Christ and Christianity. I was really quite surprised as . he is a BBC presenter and it is blasphemous. 'There are many normal, honest people who I think would have been offended. Jeremy Clarkson has a long history of controversy. In December he sparked fury for a series of Carry On style digs at India's clothing, trains, toilets, food and history. And last year the BBC apologised about an item on BBC2's Top Gear which led . to the Mexican ambassador complaining about the 'outrageous, vulgar and . inexcusable insults' made about Mexicans by Clarkson and co-hosts James . May and Richard Hammond. The BBC’s editorial complaints unit upheld criticisms of the show and ruled that it reinforced stereotypes. Clarkson was also roundly condemned . earlier this year for comments he made about the energy saving mode on . his new television which, he said, made every programme look 'like it's . being presented by Lenny Henry in a cave.' After those comments, war hero Johnson . Beharry, 31, from Grenada, said: 'Remarks like this just aren’t funny. They legitimise racism.' In . February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown . a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' and in November the previous year, the BBC . received almost 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers . murdering prostitutes. 'Sometimes the Church and Christians . are belittled and cheapened, and sometimes we deserve it, to be honest. But this is different. 'I also drew attention to double . standards between the way the BBC deals with Christianity and Islam. I'm . delighted the BBC treats Islam with such respect. 'I just wish they would treat Christianity with some.' Mr Anderson has also made a complaint . to the watchdog Ofcom. In a statement – which the vicar said was the . same response he received – a BBC spokesman said: 'There is no consensus . about words that are acceptable, when, and by whom, as different words . cause different offence to different people. 'Some of . the words and phrases that can cause offence have, whether we like it or . not, become part of everyday language and it would be unrealistic for . broadcasters to suggest they are not widely used in a range of contexts. 'We do . however respect the fundamental human right to exercise freedom of . thought, conscience and religion, this includes an individual’s freedom . to worship, teach, practice and observe. 'While we also have a duty to . reflect society as it really is, we try to ensure our output is not used . to denigrate the beliefs of others.' However, Rev Anderson was unhappy with the response, branding it a 'non reply', and has vowed never to watch Top Gear again. 'It did not really engage with my concerns at all,' he added. 'So far, I have not heard Jeremy Clarkson apologise for anything and mean it. Part of me didn’t want to go very public with this because he might need this type of publicity for his career. 'I won’t be watching again. I can’t risk the offence.' Rev Anderson has also complained to Ofcom, and is awaiting a response. Clarkson’s comments were made in a episode of Top Gear that aired on March 4. He shouted 'Jesus wept' while driving a KTM X-bow open stop sports car in the rain from his home in London to the show’s studio at Dunsford Aerodrome in Waverley, Surrey, and blurted out ‘God Almighty’ as he was behind the wheel of a Bentley powered by a Spitfire engine. It is not the first time Top Gear has offended Christians. The 2010 Boxing Day edition of the show caused anger with a nativity scene that depicted the new Stig - the show’s mystery test driver - as the baby Jesus.","Car enthusiast Reverend Graeme Anderson has vowed never to watch Top Gear again .
