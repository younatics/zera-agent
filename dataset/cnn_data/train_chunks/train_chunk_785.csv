For years, they were the  preserve of youngsters. But now video games are proving to be a popular tool for the older generation as they look to stay in shape. A survey by Saga has found that one in 25 over-50s exercise using Nintendo’s Wii Fit video game. The title is even popular among those who have long since retired, with one in 50 over-75s using the game to keep fit. The poll of more than 10,000 older . people found that 80 per cent were more conscious of the need to . exercise and live a healthy lifestyle now than they were in their . thirties. It revealed . that more people are putting in the hours as they get older, with a . quarter of women saying they do more exercise now than when they were . younger. Almost 40 per cent of fiftysomethings . flex their muscles for two to five hours each week – but of those aged . between 65 and 69, the rate rises to almost half.

Wii Fit, which comes with an . electronic ‘balance board’ to monitor the player’s weight, has even . overtaken the perennial pensioners’ favourite, bowls, in popularity. The video game guides players through a variety of exercises, including yoga. Ros Altmann, Saga’s director-general, . said: ‘It’s really beginning to dawn on the older generations that the . retirement age is not a countdown to the nursing home, but the start of . the 'bonus years'. ‘To make the most of the opportunities . in work and play, they need to have a decent standard of fitness – so . more older people are spending more time exercising.’ However, rather than using the Wii to . ward off the ill-effects of old age or prepare for working longer, some . of the survey participants said they decided to do more exercise in . order to improve their sex life. The comments follow a survey earlier . this year which found that people in their fifties prioritise sex more . than those in their thirties. For fiftysomethings, sex was  the third most popular pastime, behind eating out at restaurants and gardening. However, it was only tenth in the list for thirtysomethings, who preferred going to the gym or watching television.","Survey found one in 25 over-50s exercise using Nintendo’s Wii Fit video game .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Thousands of firefighters from across Massachusetts and beyond have joined family and friends in paying final respects to a 43-year-old Boston firefighter killed in a nine-alarm blaze last week. Lt. Edward Walsh died alongside 33-year-old colleague Michael Kennedy when they became trapped by the fire at a Back Bay brownstone one week ago. Walsh was married with three children all under the age of 10 who were all in attendance at his funeral today. The funeral came the day after firefighters spent hours searching through the rubble for 'Eddie's' wedding ring, which was missing from his hand when his body was found. Emotional salute: Fellow firefighters give a final tribute to the funeral procession of Boston Fire Lt. Edward Walsh as the coffin arrived outside the Church of Saint Patrick in Watertown on Wednesday . Hero's reception: Engine 33 and Ladder 15 were used to transport Walsh's coffin . Brothers in arms: Thousands of firefighters and police officers from across Massachusetts attended the funeral on Wednesday . Filling the streets: Lt. Walsh, a 43-year-old . father-of-two, was one of two firefighters who died in a nine-alarm . blaze last week . Sea of uniforms: Walsh's funeral (pictured)came first today and colleague Michael Kennedy's will be held Thursday in Boston's West Roxbury neighborhood . 'Eddie never took his wedding ring off,' firefighter Richie Paris told the Boston Globe. Walsh's . wife Kristen called the firehouse asking if they had found the ring . during the ensuing investigation after the fire, his friends realized . that it was still missing and headed out to the site for hours on . Tuesday to find it. The . Globe reported that the group found the ring just before dusk and . rushed to the church where his wake was being held to get it back to . Kristen. She put it on her finger- even though it was much too big for . her- while seated next to her husband's coffin. On Wednesday, it was a sea of blue uniforms along the . streets outside of St Patrick's Church in suburban Watertown in support . of their fellow emergency responder. Walsh will be buried next to his father, a former Watertown firefighter. His late uncle also served as a fireman in Watertown and his cousin is currently their captain. The Mass was attended by Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley and Irish tenor Ronan Tynan sang. Kennedy's wake is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. His funeral is Thursday in Boston's West Roxbury neighborhood. Staying strong: Walsh's widow Kristen stands and watches her husband's casket pass by .

"By . Paul Newman . To his millions of followers, Kevin Pietersen presented a picture of a loyal man who had been forced into exile from the country he loves. Twenty-four hours after being dismissed by England, Pietersen took to Instagram to post a picture of him looking distraught after his final Test innings in Sydney as England crashed to a defeat that sealed their 5-0 Ashes humiliation. ‘So sad that this will now be the last time I leave a field in an England shirt,’ posted Pietersen. ‘I love England and honestly hope they have every success in the future.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alec Stewart reflect on the end of Pietersen's England career . Bittersweet tweet: Pietersen posted this on Twitter with a link to this Instagram picture (below) showing him leaving the Sydney Cricket Ground, but his reaction in the dressing room wasn't taken to kindly . Struggles: Pietersen attempted to turn the team against Flower (right) and clashed with captain Cook (left) Sweet words, but those who observed him in the England dressing room saw a different side of KP. Sportsmail can . reveal that as soon as Pietersen was away from the public eye in the . Sydney pavilion he whistled happily all the way into the England . dressing room and continued as he sat down in his place alongside . team-mates. Pietersen’s . apparent nonchalance over his dismissal, at the start of an embarrassing . clatter of wickets that left English cricket as a complete laughing . stock, shocked his team-mates and the England management. Some . senior England figures believe he departed the international scene with . a whiff of hypocrisy. His actions were considered another example of . the attitude and poor example that had completely exasperated senior . figures and convinced them it was the end of the road for their gifted . maverick. Over and out: England have decided it is not worth keeping Pietersen in the side . Happier times: Pietersen is presented with a commemorative cap after playing in his 100th Test . ‘It said everything about his apparent commitment to England,’ one of the people in that dressing room told Sportsmail on Thursday, ‘It confirmed we had lost our way, lost the team ethos that had taken us so far.’ In . isolation it may not seem too serious but to a chastened England, who . had welcomed Pietersen back after the Andrew Strauss text-gate scandal, . it was pretty much the final straw. Pietersen . had started the Ashes as an integrated part of the England group but as . time went on old habits began to creep back, with his behaviour . starting to deteriorate after the Perth Test. Sportsmail’s . information is that Pietersen was perceived to be  undermining coach . Andy Flower, whom Pietersen tried to oust as batting coach when he led . his failed coup against Peter Moores in 2008, and whose relationship . never recovered from ‘text-gate’. Out of place? He was a character, but South African-born Pietersen never belonged . There . was the pivotal team meeting after the Melbourne Test, revealed in . these pages on Thursday, where Pietersen misjudged the mood of other . players and started trying to garner support for his anti-Flower stance. Pietersen’s . decision to whistle a happy tune after his demise in the final Test was . not the only time he clashed with his team-mates in Sydney. Reports that he squared up to captain Alastair Cook are wide of the mark but the pair, Sportsmail . understands, did disagree over the best preparation for the final Test. Cook wanted to concentrate on fitness, where England had been found . wanting, whereas Pietersen thought they should be working on skills. It was then that Flower confronted Pietersen over what he saw as . attempts to turn younger players against him after the  Melbourne . meeting and decided in his mind that England’s record runscorer had to . go if they were going to emerge from the ashes of their worst ever tour . with their team principles reinstated. Critic: Pietersen told Andy Flower the issues that the England players had with his management . At . that stage it looked sure that Flower was going to stay to oversee that . rebuilding process but even after he resigned last Friday Pietersen had . fallen out with far too many important figures for any sort of reprieve . to be granted. He was told . his fate on Monday night, ahead of a final meeting between Cook, . managing director Paul Downton and one-day coach Ashley Giles, and knew . that his England career was over when he conducted a coaching session at . The Kia Oval on Tuesday. It was confirmed by the ECB on Wednesday. It . is important these details emerge because the ECB remain adamant that . they cannot publicly say what Pietersen has done wrong for legal . reasons, with the last details of Pietersen’s contract settlement still . being finalised. That . decision is leaving them open to ridicule from England fans, who expect a . proper  explanation. There was even support for Pietersen on Thursday, . from Prime Minister David Cameron as only a one-sided version of events . has so far emerged. Re-integrated: Team-mate Matt Prior posted this picture of Pietersen on Twitter in late 2012 with the caption: '""Re-integration complete. Well played"".' James . Whitaker, the new national selector, became the first man involved in . the seismic decision to speak publicly about the sacking on Thursday, . but his appearance on Sky TV was little more than an embarrassing . shambles. No newspapers were . allowed at the announcement of England’s squad for their tours of West . Indies and Bangladesh and Whitaker’s answers to Sky’s Tim Abraham, who . was admirable in the circumstances, seemed strictly controlled. However, . the usually personable Whitaker did allow himself to say of Pietersen’s . sacking: ‘In a way it was a tricky decision but in another way it gives . other players an opportunity to excel in that environment. There is a . legal position and I’m not at liberty to say anything else. England exit: Kevin Pietersen peers out of his car after discovering his international career is over . ‘Any . team has certain values that good teams adhere to and carry with them. England over the past four or five years have shown these good values. Over time they can (slip) a bit but now is the time to rewrite those. We . want to win back the positive perception of what the England team are . all about.’ It has been a . miserable week for that objective and England clearly remain paranoid . about any confidentiality clause in their agreement with Pietersen. But . if one exists, isn’t Pietersen breaking it by leaking details of the . Melbourne team meeting to his mouthpiece Piers Morgan? Pietersen’s . attack on Prior, the most selfless of England players, via Morgan on . Twitter on Wednesday was a spectacular own goal for his status as a . martyr and perhaps revealing of the real reasons behind his departure. And surely it frees up senior England figures to say far more than Whitaker managed on Thursday.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Scientists have bred a colony of rabbits that can glow in the dark in a leap forward for developing medicine for life-threatening genetic diseases. Researchers in Hawaii and Turkey successfully created the litter of eight rabbits, which included two kits that glow green when the lights are out. The florescent coloring is an indicator that genetic material injected into the embryos was incorporated into the rabbit's natural make up. Scroll down for video . Glowing: Scientists have created two rabbits that glow in the dark . Ordinary: In daylight the rabbits look the same as their littermate . 'Itâ€™s just a marker to show that we can . take a gene that was not originally in the animal and now exists in the . animal,' Dr Stefan Moisyadi, of University of Hawaii, told KITV. The rabbits, which look identical to their white siblings in daylight, were born at a research center in Turkey. Life changing: Dr Stefan Moisyadi says the experiment could help mass produce medication . 'They live just as long as normal animals do ... and they show no ill effects,' Dr Moisyadi told KHON2. He added: 'These rabbits are like a light bulb glowing, like an LED light all over their body.' The experiment, which used florescent protein from jellyfish, furthers the research started in the 1980s when glow in the dark mice were created. Since then, scientists have recreated the experiment in kittens, puppies, monkeys and piglets. While most glow green in the dark, in 2007 South Korean scientists managed to develop cats that glowed red under ultraviolet light, according to the Daily Telegraph. Scientists hope the research will help them find a way to create cheaper medicine for genetic disorders such as hemophilia. They plan to replicate the experiment in farm animals, which would then be used as bio-reactors that produce pharmaceuticals. '[For] patients who suffer from hemophilia and . they need the blood clotting enzymes in their blood, we can make those . enzymes a lot cheaper in animals with barrier reactives rather than a . factory that will cost billions of dollars to build,' Dr Moisyadi said. Now they have successful created glow in the dark bunnies, the team is planning to create a florescent lamb by November. Start small: Researchers first created glow in the dark mice and plan to repeat the experiment with farmyard animals . The team would like to bring their research to the U.S. but said bureaucracy and fear of using transgenic animals has prevented it. 'At home, there is this hysteria that transgenic animals should not be used for anything,' Dr Moisyadi said. He added that the team was committed to the research 'because there is an eventual benefit for the human race in this. And if we donâ€™t do it in these first-world countries, where will we do it?'","Experiment could help mass produce medication for genetic diseases .

"By . James  Nye . The humiliated wife of serial sexter Anthony Weiner partly blames herself for his philandering ways, it emerged today. Family and friends of Huma Abedin, 38, told People magazine that she began to beat herself up because Weiner returned to phone sex after they stopped going to couple's therapy and their new baby began to take up more of her time. However, after returning to counseling, she now feels she and Weiner are closer than ever despite revelations he continued to send lewd pictures of himself to women, including 22-year-old Sydney Leathers, who has heaped embarrassment on Abedin by making claims about her husbands sexual fetishes in her numerous media appearances. Humiliation: New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin attend a news conference in New York last month . While Abedin's decision to stand by her shamed husband in the wake of last month's latest episode has disappointed many of her would-be supporters, her friends claimed in People that she stayed with her cheating husband for the sake of their child and to 'help' her husband. 'She was seriously thinking, 'Maybe I can't do this.' There was the possibility of leaving on the table,' one family member told the magazine. 'It would have been perfectly logical if she had said, 'I'm out of here,' said family friend, Rory Tahari to the magazine. 'Any woman could have understood that.' For Better: Huma Abedin (left - with her husband on their wedding day in 2010) decided to stay in her marriage to help Weiner and for their child Jordan (right) Fresh Revelations: New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner admitted to sexting 22-year-old Sydney Leather's (right) Indeed, Abedin and New York mayoral candidate Weiner let their friends know that their marriage might end. Their friends let People Magazine know that former Hilary Clinton political aide Abedin's suffered huge doubt about their marriage during a Hamptons vacation one year ago. 'All the parties they had once been invited to, Huma was now invited to but Anthony wasn't,' a family member said. 'It was a difficult time.' However, the worst was yet to come. Just one month later after the Hampton's debacle, Weiner confessed that as their marriage deteriorated he had returned to sexting women lewd pictures of himself. He also confessed to frequent phone sex with 22-year-old Sydney Leathers and sending pictures of himself to two other women under the pseudonym Carlos Danger. Loyal: Huma Abedin, alongside her husband, New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, speaks during a news conference at the Gay Men's Health Crisis headquarters, Tuesday, July 23, 2013, in New York . However, instead of leaving her husband, Abedin resolved to stay for the sake of their 19-month-old son. 'Huma has a very strong moral character, and she made a commitment for better or worse,' said Tahari. 'She never wanted Jordan to say to her, 'Why didn't you do everything you could to help Dad?' Despite her moral conviction to stay, friends and family have said that since the news broke of Weiner's continued sexting habit, Abedin has been trying to hide her tears from her son. 'He is the light in her life, and that's what she was focused on. She needed to pull herself together,' said one friend to People magazine. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (R) receives a note from her aide Huma Abedin (L) as she testifies about the State Department's 2012 budget during a hearing of the State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Subcommittee . And, since it became clear she is not going to walk away from her marriage, Abedin has become distraught at the second guessing of her decision by friends - including the Clintons. 'No one wants to see Huma go through this,' said a source close to the Clintons. 'They are done with him. As part of caring about Huma, neither would shed a tear if he left the race and went away.' Despite the public disapproval for remaining with Weiner, Abedin has vowed to continued to campaign by his side. Seemingly stuck between a rock and a hard place, Abedin is acutely aware that if she appears too forgiving it will add to her husband's problems, but if she disappears altogether, it will look worse. 'Every day that she alluded to his problems and said he's a better man and it's in the past, she was taking it too far,' a friend said. 'She knows that.' 'What worries me about her is this feeling that she has to be what everyone thinks she is. Some steely superhuman.'","Huma Abedin, 38, has told friends that she felt responsible for Anthony Weiner's sexting .

"By . Kirsty Walker . Updated: . 04:06 EST, 29 December 2011 . The number of elderly people being admitted to accident and emergency departments has soared to more than 1.2million a year, figures have revealed. The numbers of over-80s taken to A&E has risen 37 per cent in two years, according to the Department of Health figures – from 913,785 in 2007/08 to more than 1,247,672 million in 2009/10. Last night campaigners blamed a crisis in out-of-hours care provision and Britain’s increasing ageing population. Surge: The numbers of over-80s taken to A&E has risen 37 per cent in two years, according to the Department of Health figures . Pledges: David Cameron (left) and Health Secretary Andrew Lansley (right) promised the NHS will not be affected by cuts to public spending . Revealed in a Parliamentary answer, the figures will add to the pressure on casualty departments amid fears that many are already struggling to cope with too few staff and not enough beds. Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a member of the Commons Health Select Committee, warned last night that the NHS was in danger of ‘going bust’ unless an ‘urgent solution to the crisis of social care’ is found. He said: ‘These figures show the serious impact that our ageing population is having upon the NHS. ‘We must get to grips with how we . ensure that the elderly are best cared for- more than ever, we need to . find an urgent solution to the crisis of social care we are likely to . face. Otherwise the NHS will likely go bust under the demands placed . upon it.’ Burden: The figures will add to the pressure on casualty departments amid fears that many are already struggling to cope with too few staff and not enough beds . David Cameron and Health Secretary Andrew Lansley promised the NHS will not be affected by cuts to public spending. But medical groups and charities warn health spending is failing to keep pace with the rising cost of the ageing population. A poll of GPs and hospital doctors . earlier this week found that four out of five doctors said they had seen . patient care suffer as a result of health service cuts during 2011. Warning: MP Chris Skidmore said the NHS was in danger of 'going bust' unless an 'urgent solution to the crisis of social care' is found . Ruthe Isden, of Age UK, said: ‘There is a general sense . that there is a problem with inadequate and patchy out of hours . provision. 'People can find themselves unable to access the help they . need from GPs or community services at night or the weekend, as a result . they may turn to A&E due to a lack of an alternative. 'Lack of access to end-of-life care services at home and in the community may also be a problem.’ She added that the rise in admissions was also due to poor management of chronic and long term conditions. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said more elderly people were being forced to fend for themselves,  leaving them more vulnerable to injury. Health Minister Paul Burstow blamed the increase on Labour’s botched handling of GP contracts which allowed them to opt out of responsibility for patients outside office hours and at weekends. He said: ‘Labour’s disastrous decision to stop GPs being responsible for out of hours care meant that hospitals saw huge increases in the number of vulnerable patients having to go to hospital. ‘These figures expose the extent of Labour’s failure. Under the Coalition’s plans, GPs will take responsibility for out of hours care and we are establishing a new 111 urgent care system that will mean everyone will get the care they need first time round.’","Numbers of over-80s rises 37 per cent in two years .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An airstrike yesterday killed a top Al Qaeda leader on the FBI's most wanted list for his role in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole warship, Yemeni officials have confirmed. The CIA drone attack killed Fahd al-Quso as he stepped out of his vehicle, along with another Al Qaeda operative in the southern Shabwa province. News of his death comes as officials say Al Qaeda militants have killed 20 Yemeni soldiers and captured a further 25 in the south of the country this morning. Plotter? Senior Al Qaeda leader Fahd Al-Quso, killed on Sunday by a drone strike, was believed to be behind the updated underpants bomb plot . The Yemeni officials were speaking on condition of anonymity in accordance with military regulations. The U.S. refused to confirm al-Quso's death but a telephone text message claiming to be from Al Qaeda media arm confirmed al-Quso was killed in the strike. The airstrike came as the U.S. and Yemen cooperate in a battle against Al Qaeda in southern Yemen. Reports emerged this morning of a pre-dawn assault by Al Qaeda militants on an army base in the southern Abyan province. In response, government forces shelled militant positions elsewhere in Abyan, killing 16 fighters. Al-Quso, 37, was on the FBI's most wanted list, with a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. He was indicted in the U.S. for his role in the 2000 bombing in the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen, in which 17 American sailors were killed and 39 injured. He served more than five years in a Yemeni prison for his role in the attack and was released in 2007. He briefly escaped prison in 2003 but later turned himself in to serve the rest of his sentence. Wanted: Al-Quso was on the FBI's most wanted list for his role in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole warship . Open Wound: After the attack on the USS Cole, 17 American sailors were killed and 39 injured . Al-Quso was also one of the most senior Al Qaeda leaders publicly linked to the 2009 Christmas airliner attack. He has allegedly met the suspected bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in Yemen before he left on his way to execute his failed bombing over Detroit. In December 2010, al-Quso was designated a global terrorist by the State Department, an indication that his role in Al Qaeda's Yemen branch had grown more prominent. Local Yemeni official Abu Bakr bin Farid and the Yemeni Embassy in Washington confirmed al-Quso was killed in Rafd, a remote mountain valley in Shabwa. Yemeni soldiers patrol in the southern province of Abyan yesterday before an Al Qaeda attack killed 20 soldiers . Still There? Because U.S. officials have not confirmed his death, he's still listed on the FBI's list . It is the area where many of Al Qaeda leaders are believed to have taken cover, including the U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, killed in a U.S. airstrike in Yemen last year. Yemeni government officials reported that al-Quso and al-Awlaki were killed in an airstrike in 2009 in Rafd, but they both resurfaced alive. Al-Quso was known for his ability to move in disguise. He was from the same tribe as al-Awlaki, and local tribesmen said he was a close aide. He studied ultraconservative Salafi Islam as a teenager in northern Yemen, then returned home to learn welding. False Alert: Yemeni government officials falsely reported that Al-Quso was killed in an airstrike in 2009 . The White House and the State Department had no immediate comment.Yemen's government has been waging an offensive on Al Qaeda militants, who have taken advantage of the country's political turmoil over the last year to expand their hold in the south. The new Yemeni president has promised improved cooperation with the U.S. to combat the militants. On Saturday, he said the fight against Al Qaeda is in its early stages. Al-Quso's association with Al Qaeda dated back more than a decade, when he met with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. Bin Laden allegedly told him to â€˜eliminate the infidels from the Arabian Peninsula.â€™ . From there he rose through the ranks. He was assigned in Aden to videotape the 1998 suicide bombing of the USS Cole, but he fell asleep. Despite the lapse, the local leader, Nasser al-Wahishi, declared him the regional leader in Aden. He was also believed to have played a prominent role in Al Qaeda's attack and capture last year of Zinjibar, the capital of Abyan province.Government troops are trying to drive Al Qaeda out of Zinjibar.","Fahd al-Quso killed by CIA drone attack in south of country .

Designed by ipv Delft, the 'Hovenring' was commissioned by the Dutch city of Eindhoven to 'hover' over a busy motorway intersection that has seen a number of accidents to cyclists in recent years.

'Like a flying saucer,' the firm's website says, 'the steel bridge hovers above the Heerbaan/Meerenakkerweg intersection, its impressive pylon marking the entrance way to the cities of Eindhoven and Veldhoven. 'There used to be a level crossing here, but the development of a nearby housing estate meant the intersection needed changing in order to cope with growing traffic.

New idea: The firm says there used to be a level crossing there, but the development of a nearby housing estate meant the intersection needed changing in order to cope with growing traffic . Safer all round: Lights attached to a cable framework in between the pylon and bridge deck and to the inner surface of the circular counterweight illuminate the intersection underneath, making it a safer place for pedestrians as well . Heavyweight: A 230-foot tall central pylon was erected, which was then connected by 24 steel cables to the circular bridge deck to hold a structure weighing more than one million kilograms . 'As Eindhoven City Council refrains from cyclist underpasses and didnâ€™t want a level crossing roundabout either, they asked (us) to look at possible solutions. A circular cable-stayed bridge soon appeared to be the best option.' It adds that 'the functional lighting is integrated into the railing, where LED-lighting illuminates the bridge deck and ensures facial recognition of the bridge users at the same time'. Lights attached to a cable framework in between the pylon and bridge deck and to the inner surface of the circular counterweight illuminate the intersection underneath, making it a safer place for pedestrians as well. Construction started on February 11 2011 and the suspended roundabout opened the following December. A 230-foot tall central pylon was . erected, which was then connected by 24 steel cables to the circular . bridge deck to hold a structure weighing more than one million . kilograms. But within a few weeks, unexpected vibrations in the cables caused by wind forced it to be closed while engineers worked to fix the problem. After extensive research by structural experts, high frequency and low frequency vibration dampeners were attached to the cables to resolve the vibration issues. The Hovenring officially reopened to the public on 29 June 2012.","The 'Hovenring' will 'hover' over a busy motorway in Dutch city Eindhoven .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . Friends and family said goodbye to Johran McCormick on Monday, while wearing bow ties and singing along to the tune of American gospel song When the Saints Go Marching In. They said they had chosen to dress up in bow dies because Johran liked wearing them. In the sky above the church, multi-colored balloons soared in his memory. The 17-year-old, from Spring near Houston, Texas, was shot dead on Sunday when an unidentified father found the boy in his 16-year-old daughter's room. Gone too soon: Johran McCormick, 17, was shot dead early Thursday morning after sneaking in to the house of a 16-year-old girl. His sorrowful mother Zakia says she expects the girl's father to call her and apologize . The daughter initially denied knowing Mr McCormick but later admitted that she did know the boy who was in her bed. A grand jury will now decide whether any charges will be filed against the Texas father who fired one fatal shot at a 17-year-old boy he found in his teenage daughter's bedroom early Thursday morning. On Sunday, friends and family remembered the boy that they called the bird man at a funeral at Plymouth United Church, Spring. Tributes were paid to the teenager, one friend told Click2Houston: 'I just miss him, I wish I could hug him one more time.' Another described him as 'an amazing person'. 'I feel terrible that that had to happen to him,' she said. Others expressed their views on the father who fired the shot with several friends saying that he should be put behind bars. Another expressed the anger that he felt towards the daughter who was found in bed with the teenager. He told the Houston television channel: 'I don't actually think the father should be charged - I think the daughter should be.'

"By . Sam Creighton . and Kieran Corcoran . Julie Griffiths has been accused of breaching her order for a third time . A wife from hell who was given an Asbo for shouting at her own husband so loudly it kept her neighbours awake is being hauled back before a court for a third time - for laying into her partner's hygiene. Julie Griffiths, 45, is accused of breaking the terms of her order and will answer to magistrates on April 14, just two weeks after she was was fined for berating Norman Griffiths, 64, for buying the wrong type of scratch card. As this would be her third time breaking the conditions of her Asbo, which bans her from making noises loud enough to disturb neighbours of her terraced house in Talke, Staffordshire, the warehouse worker could face up to 26 weeks in jail. In a recording of the latest rant, obtained by The Sun, Mrs Griffiths can be heard shouting: 'Give the bath a clean. Why should I have to do it? I drew a bath for you. 'Get that Cillit and give the bath a clean. No, not that one... Get the door shut... Shut the door... I keep saying, shut the door... you have to shut the door... Come out and shut that door... For God’s sake what you doing?' The tirade did not stop there, however. Popping outside for a cigarette, she continued to yell back into the house: 'You mind if I have a bath once a week... because you’ve got no hygiene sense. I have a bath every day. I said you’re washed then? There’s no water running.' Mrs Griffiths appeared before North Staffordshire Justice Centre on Tuesday and was ordered to pay £270 after a blistering 45-minute rant at her husband for buying the wrong type of scratch card. Neighbours have been complaining about her outbursts since 1999, and it was around thirteen years before she received her Asbo in December 2012. She was also dragged into court after a noisy argument last year. Griffiths, pictured in 2012 around the time of her ASBO being issued, was fined on Tuesday for breaching order . Night-shift worker Griffiths was originally handed a five-year Asbo in December 2012 after noise monitoring equipment was installed to measure the volume of her shouting. The ruling prohibits her from creating noise audible to neighbouring properties, shouting, screaming or banging on internal doors and communicating with certain neighbours. But she breached it just four months later it was imposed when she argued with Norman last April. Alan Dawson, defending her at her court appearance earlier this week, said: 'The circumstances are that Julie Griffiths lives in a terrace with her husband of 25 years. Unlucky neighbours: People have been complaining about the noise Griffiths made since 1999 . 'She has an Asbo but during this day in particular, there is an argument at the address and it’s as simple as that. 'There is no intention by this lady to encroach on the neighbours, she confined the argument to the house, she was not out on the streets, but the neighbours could hear it. 'Her husband said he slammed the door when he left the room and that was not her. Griffiths admitted the offence and accepts what she has done. 'She has lived at the address for 26 years and it is only quite recently that these issues have been reported. This is a lady who wants to get on with her life and keep herself to herself, but there is going to be some escape of noise in relation to her neighbours.' Magistrates told Griffiths that breaching an Asbo was a serious offence but agreed to be lenient on this occasion. She was fined £165 and ordered to pay £105 in court costs. She must also attend anger management classes. Griffiths, who was escorted from court by two police officers, refused to comment after the hearing. Julie Griffiths's rants will be nothing new to her long-suffering neighbours, who have been complaining about her for more than a decade. She was first given a noise abatement order in 1999, and was fined £500 for a breach which was recorded in 2010. Over the next two years the situation became especially dire, and the local council eventually installed noise monitoring equipment in 2012. Between July and October of that year, Griffiths breached her noise abatement order an incredible 47 times. Neighbours revealed that she has been banned from family events thanks to her short temper. After receiving her Asbo in December 2012, it was just four months until she was back in court for breaching the order. She was then fined £750 and ordered to pay costs of £85. Irate neighbours eventually revealed the contents of her furious rants, in which she orders the long-suffering Norman Griffiths out of the house. In . one from the morning of August 27 2012, she can be heard shouting: 'Get . out if you want a fag. Go! You’re not smoking in bed, I said get out if . you want a fag! Get out if you want a fag! Get your shoes on and get out . if you want a fag. Now get out.’ Griffiths then continues her . rant, screeching: ‘Not gone yet, can’t hear the door, get your shoes on . and get out, otherwise you’ll know about it. Get out, Do I have to say it . again.’ In another she tell her husband: 'Don't worry Norman, I'm just about sick of you!' Further clips show she is aware of being recorded, but continues regardless. She says: 'Stop ignoring me, you are. I am being recorded by them next door now thanks to you.''They are recording every day. Because of you  I keep f*****g up.'

"By . Ashley Collman . While its competitors are shelling out $4million for 30 second spots during Sunday's Super Bowl, Chipotle Mexican Grill will be paying $1million for a four-episode TV series that only mentions the restaurant once. Next month, the Denver-based fast casual chain will release a new series called 'Farmed and Dangerous' on Hulu, which promises to be a satirical take on industrial farming. No scenes will be filmed at Chipotle restaurants and there will be no lines about how delicious their burrito bowls are as the brand steps takes native advertising into original programming. Instead the series is designed to subtly draw attention to the fact that Chipotle promises to use wherever possible meat and dairy from animals raised without antibiotics or hormones and organic produce. Scroll down for video . Shared values: Chipotle will be releasing a four-part Hulu TV series called 'Farmed and Dangerous' in an attempt at subtle advertising that will bring in customers who agree with their 'Food with Integrity' message. Above, a still from the series . Bosses hope message that will make consumers naturally gravitate to their restaurant. The series will include four 30 minute episodes and star actor Ray Wise as Buck Marshall, a man who works for farmers who are planning to feed cows petroleum pellets to lower costs. In a subtle nod to the chain, the hero will be named Chip, a young man dating Mr Marshall's daughter. '""Farmed and Dangerous"" is meant to strike large emotional chords â€” itâ€™s not about selling burritos,' Daniel Rosenberg, a former Hollywood executive whose company, Piro, produced the series with Chipotle, told the New York Times. No Golden Arches here: The Denver-based company will only be referenced by name once in the show, in a line to clarify that they are not owned by McDonald's - a common misconception . Mr Rosenberg says the process for producing the show was no different than for any other TV show. His agent took the idea to Hulu, and screenwriter Jeremy Pikser (who wrote the film Bulworth) was brought in to pen the scripts. On Hulu, the show will be called a 'Chipotle original series' but it will exist right next to all their other television shows. The company's executives say they have no problem putting it on the site because of the high-production quality. Like all Hulu shows, there will be breaks for advertisements, and some of the ads will be for Chipotle. But the only time the restaurant will be mentioned during the show is in a line clarifying that Chipotle is not, in fact, owned by McDonald's. Their message: The company previously produced short animated videos backed by popular musicians, promoting a return to simple farming . The restaurant has been struggling to disassociate itself from the fast food giant which had a controlling stake in the company until 2006. Since its inception, the company has prided itself as a restaurant that serves 'Food with Integrity'. On their website, Chipotle promises to use - whenever possible - meat and dairy from animals raised without antibiotics or hormones and organic produce. 'Farmed and Dangerous' will cost the company $250,000 an episode, and could go on to have multiple seasons and distribution overseas. This isn't the first time that Chipotle has gotten innovative with its advertising. Last year, the company produced several short animated videos promoting a return to simple farming and their new app game, featuring music by Willie Nelson and Fiona Apple. Since being founded in 1993, the company has expanded to $1,500 and is worth more than $15billion on the stock market.","'Farmed and Dangerous' will not feature any scenes shot at Chipotle and will only reference the restaurant once .

"By . Martin Robinson . A depressed woman who strangled her disabled husband with a cravat because he was 'too nice' only failed to murder him because a Sainsbury's driver arrived to deliver their weekly shop, a court heard. Christine Houston, 66, has admitted the attempted murder of partner Stewart, who said today she is still 'as gentle as a lamb' and he remains 'devoted' to her. Mrs Houston, who has a history of mental health problems, will be detained indefinitely in a mental hospital for her crime, but Mr Houston believes she should never have been prosecuted. Attempted murder: Christine Houston, left, was interrupted while trying to murder her husband Stewart, right,  by the arrival of a shopping delivery. Mr Houston says he loves her and she shouldn't have been prosecuted . Saved: Mrs Houston was in the process of trying to kill her husband when their shopping from Sainsbury's arrived (file picture) After her sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court the couple shared a hug outside before she was taken away to hospital. One of the reasons Mrs Houston, a retired pharmacist, gave for attempting to kill her husband was that he was 'too nice'. Mr Houston, who suffers from muscular dystrophy and is wheelchair bound, was left with blood spotting behind his eyes and marks to his neck as a result of the attack. Newcastle Crown Court heard that the attack only stopped when a Sainsbury's shopping delivery arrived and interrupted them. Mr Houston dialled 999 and said that his wife had tried to strangle him, not long after Mrs Houston herself called the police in a distressed state. Prosecuting Barrister Jamie Hill QC said: 'She was describing herself as being very cruel from an early age and that she has been neglecting her husband. 'She asserted that she had fooled people for years, that she was a Christian when in fact she was an evil person. 'When the police arrived Mrs Houston said ""I tried to kill him, I wanted him dead"".' Sentencing: The judge at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) decided she should be detained indefinitely in a mental hospital . But outside court today Mr and Mrs Houston shared a loving embrace and Mr Houston said: 'Christine has shown a great deal of sacrifice and love in the 28-years that we have been married.' In love: Despite his ordeal Mr Houston has paid tribute to his wife and her love and care for him over 28 years . The killing bid has been linked to 'carer's fatigue', where a person snaps through the pressures of looking after a loved one. Tony Davis, defending said that Mrs Houston had been an 'extremely caring person and a cheerful wife' and that 'thankfully this was a very brief moment in time.' Mrs Houston, who is of previous good character but suffering from severe mental health problems including bipolar disorder resulting in severe depressive episodes, psychotic episodes and obsessive thoughts which had began in her 20's. The 66-year-old pleaded guilty to attempted murder at their home in Waldridge, Chester le Street and was held in a secure mental hospital following the attack where she will now remain as Judge Paul Sloane sentenced her to an indefinite hospital order. Mrs Houston also admitted trying to strangle her husband the day before with his oxygen tube but stopped when the victim asked her to. Judge Paul Sloan said: 'On May 26 your husband called the police and reported that you had tried to strangle him on that occasion with a cravat. 'You said that you had wanted to kill your husband but as you didn't have a gun and you didn't like knives strangling was all you could think of. 'Your husband still loves you and wants you to receive help.'","Christine Houston, 66, admitted the attempted murder of partner Stewart .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Young pupils at an exclusive prep school have been told they must improve their manners after failing their headteacher's 'Politeness Challenge'. Boys at Wetherby Prep School in Notting Hill, London, were sent home for their Easter holidays with a ticking off by headmaster Nick Baker, who wrote in his his blog to parents that some pupils had 'lost focus' when it came to being polite. The children at the private school, formed as a sister school to Wetherby Pre-Prep where Princes William and Harry were pupils, were set the challenge of improving their manners after Mr Baker spotted two students being rude. Minding their manners: Young pupils at exclusive Wetherby Prep School have been told they must improve their manners after failing their headteacher's 'Politeness Challenge' 'I witnessed some pretty poor behaviour from a couple of normally . incredibly polite and considerate boys this week,' he had written in January. 'It was not directed . at a teacher or another boy in the school, but directed towards their . driver and nanny, respectively. 'I really was taken aback by the way . that these boys spoke and their lack of respect towards an adult.' Mr Baker said the incident had prompted him to set up the Politeness Challenge at the £16,935 a year school, telling parents they had his full support when it came to disciplining their children if they were rude to family members. In his latest letter to parents, Mr Baker said that his initiative had improved standards of manners and courtesy in the school, and that both visitors and staff had been impressed with the politeness exhibited by pupils, who are aged between four and eight. Alumni: The children at the private school, formed as a sister school to Wetherby Pre-Prep where Princes William and Harry were pupils, were set the challenge of improving their manners after Mr Baker spotted two students being rude . But he said that the boys had not fully met the criteria of the challenge, and therefore it would continue into the summer term. 'The . instantaneous improvement that we witnessed earlier in the school year . has dissipated somewhat,' he wrote. 'Therefore, we are rolling over to next term. 'I . hate ending the term on a low point but I am sure you will agree that . this is an important area that we cannot simply cave into or one in . which we should be too liberal with our praise.' In February, Education secretary Michael Gove claimed the Thomas Jones primary school in West London, where most children are brought up with English as a foreign language offers a better education than Wetherby. In a speech to the London Academy of . Excellence, Mr Gove said the evidence shows ‘beyond any reasonable . doubt’ that English state education is starting to show a ‘sustained and . significant improvement’. He . said state schools could become the best in the world by tapping into . the expertise of the independent sector, claiming that Wetherby school . in particular may already have been overtaken by nearby state schools . teaching much poorer pupils. Improving: Mr Baker said that the boys had not fully met the criteria of the challenge, and therefore it would continue into the summer term . Contrast: In February, Education secretary Michael Gove claimed the Thomas Jones primary school in West London, where most children are brought up with English as a foreign language offers a better education than Wetherby . He said: ‘There are state primary schools every bit as ambitious, as supportive, as exciting, as the smartest of private prep schools. ‘Like, for example, Thomas Jones primary in West London – a school with a majority of children eligible for free school meals during the last six years, a majority coming from homes where English is not their first language – which is just as good, if not better, than the pre-eminent London prep - Wetherby school - just a mile or so away. ‘Under the changes we're making, it’s becoming easier for state schools to match the offer from private schools. ‘Instead of reinforcing the Berlin Wall between state and private, as the current Labour leadership appear to want, we should break it down.’ Responding to Mr Gove's comments in his blog, Mr Baker said: 'I have no knowledge of the school they referred to but I am delighted . that it is doing so well and is thriving. 'The Education Secretary . often makes many newsworthy comments and, at the very least, it gets . people discussing education. William and Harry both attended the pre-prep school in Notting Hill in the 1980s before taking up places at Ludgrove School in Berkshire and later Eton.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 21-year-old suspected bank robber was busted by the FBI after posting photos of himself on his Facebook page brandishing a submachine gun he allegedly used in a Michigan heist. Jules Bahler, who calls himself 'King Romeo', posted the 'selfies' on March 5 with the accompanying caption, 'Bought my first house And chopper today … lifes great (sic). That same day, according to an FBI affidavit, the Brooklyn native threatened staff at Chemical Bank branch in Bay City, Michigan, with the assault-style weapon and fled with about $7,000. Authorities say they were able to match Bahler's face from his Facebook  pictures with images of the robber from surveillance footage, linking him to three robberies in Pontiac, Michigan. Selfies: Police tracked down suspected bank robber Jules Bahler, 21, after he posted these images of himself brandishing a gun on his Facebook page . Weapon: On March 5, Jules Bahler posted this picture of a new gun he purchased on his Facebook page . Bahler is also accused of stealing $4,300 from Genisys Credit Union on February 26 and $4,000 from a Bank of America branch on March 4. The Smoking Gun reported that a day after the March 5 robbery, Sergeant Todd Hunt of the Oakland Sheriff's Office was tipped off about the suspect's Facebook page.The affidavit doesn't reveal where Hunt got his information. 'Affiant looked at these photographs and observed that the individual depicted in the photographs appeared to be the same individual,' the affidavit states. 'Additionally, affiant had an agent from the FBI's Bay City Resident Agency look at the photographs and he indicated that the machine gun looked like the same gun used in the robbery of the Chemical Bank in Bay City.' Police identified the weapon as a submachine gun. FBI officials  and local sheriff’s deputies began staking out Bahler's South Astor St, Pontiac, home - which he recently purchased - on March 7. After Bahler emerged and drove off, the investigators stopped him, and said they found the machine gun in a duffel bag in the car. Officials also said he confessed to the robberies. He has been charged with bank robbery and carrying a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and is reportedly scheduled to face U.S. District Court in Detroit tomorrow. Accused: Bahler (left) has been charged with robbing three banks in Michigan, using a machine gun (right) in one of them .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Two young brothers dubbed 'demons from hell' after making their neighbours' lives a misery are still getting into trouble with the law nearly a decade later. Ricky and Daniel Oakley were both given anti-social behaviour orders in 2006 when they were just 11 and 12. It was hoped the ASBOs would help put a stop to their loutish behaviour which included throwing knives, starting fires and letting down tyres in their hometown of Park Village in Wolverhampton. But fast-forward eight years and it seems not much has changed, with both brothers - who were once nicknamed the 'Asbros' - having racked up a string of criminal convictions. Scroll down for video . Asbros: Ricky, 18, pictured left, and Danny Oakley, 20, pictured right, have both racked up a string of convictions since they were handed ASBOs in 2006 . The Oakleys feature in a new documentary Running Riot: Britain's Teen Crims, which looks at what has become of some of the UK's most notorious tearaway teens. And in the case of the brothers, it seems they decided to continue down the road of misdemeanors and petty crime. Daniel Oakley, now 20, was yesterday sentenced to a 12-month probation order at Walsall Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to burglary. He was also ordered to pay £570. It is his fourth criminal conviction to date. Meanwhile is brother Ricky, now 18, has . been in and out of prison six times since he and his brother were first . given two-year ASBOs in 2006. It demanded the pair behave or face five years in a young offenders institution but both brothers now admit they just saw the ASBOs as badges of honour. Ricky told documentary makers: 'The . ASBO really didn't bother me. It was like: ""We've got one, you haven't. We've been to the police station and to court"". They were a badge of . honour.' The boys claim they grew up in a troubled household. Abandoned by their mother at a young age and left in the sole care of their father, they said they became used to committing antisocial behaviour and crime. Ricky said: 'My mum wasn’t there for us. We didn’t have the family support we needed. 'I . thought what’s the point? I may as well go out and get in trouble . because I’m having more fun with that than I am with my family.' During . their reign of terror in their small community, the brothers often set things a light, which on one occasion resulted in the pair both suffering severe burns . after Ricky placed a can of foam on a fire and it exploded. 'Demons from hell': Daniel Oakley, 12, and Ricky Oakley, 11, pictured soon after getting their ASBOs in 2006. They are both shown with injuries after Ricky put a can of foam on to a bonfire and it exploded . Ricky . said: 'Me and my brother were setting fire bins, anything we could really. We’d make fires in the street. We even set fire to one of the neighbour’s car. We did it for attention. 'We were doing general kids stuff - knocking on people’s door, . running off, putting bricks through windows, smashing up neighbours . cars, smashing the fences, jumping over back gardens.' Danny added: 'I did used to find it funny to go out there and cause trouble. Everything I did was a laugh. 'I thought it’s funny to throw an egg or to smash someone’s fence down or to rob someone’s car.' At 10 years old, the boys’ petty crimes escalated to burglaries and robberies. Danny admitted: 'It wasn’t just once a week it. It was constant offending - every single day.' Ricky added: 'We were taking anything we could - TVs, PlayStations, any mobile phones, gold. Anything you could carry under your arm we’d take it. 'And we’d sell it straight away so when the police came around they’d have no evidence on us so they’d have to release us.' He added: 'When we robbed people with a knife we’d say give me all your shit out of your pockets now, otherwise you’re going to get stabbed. 'The reason people took it so seriously was because people had heard from our neighbours what we were like and we’d stop at nothing to get what we wanted.' Back in court: Daniel Oakley, now 20, was yesterday sentenced to a 12-month probation order for burglary . Despite receiving the ASBOs, the brothers say they still found a way to carry out their criminal activities. Danny said: 'My ASBO never banned me from coming in to Walsall town centre. 'There are a lot of shops that are quite easy for shoplifters. My brother and I didn’t used to care. We’d walk in to a shop like it was our own shop and take what we wanted.' Ricky added: 'When I was younger people probably saw me as a bit of psychopath. They said we didn’t have empathy, we didn’t care about people. We didn’t see it like that. We just thought why should we care about people.' But since 2006, Danny claims he has tried to get his life back on track. He said: 'I’m well known for bad things. I don’t want to be known for that anymore. All I can do is apologise for what I’ve done. 'I’m now just thinking positive. I’m going to get myself somewhere to live and I’m going to get a job and star working.' His brother, however, doesn't share his concerns. Ricky, who was released from . Brinsford prison, Wolverhampton, last month, said: 'I’m not bothered about going back [to jail]. It doesn’t bother me because I’m not scared of jail. 'That’s why I go back so many times because I’m not scared.' He added: 'In jail you get three meals a day, . a warm bed and a TV, you get people looking after you. 'Some people . have got more on the inside than they have on the outside. That’s why . most people go back to jail because they’ve got less on the outside than . they do in jail.'","Ricky and Daniel Oakley were given anti-social behaviour orders in 2006 .

"By . Dan Bloom . A woman was left feeling ‘violated and butchered’ after routine surgery left her with virtually the same effects as female genital . mutilation, a tribunal has heard in the first case of its kind. Dr Sureshkumar Pandya performed a commonplace operation on the woman in 2012 - but last year, after she fell pregnant, a midwife who examined her said she had been mutilated. Today Dr Pandya appeared before a tribunal where it was claimed he was acting beyond the 'limits of his competence' and removed parts of the woman's genitals which should have remained intact. Accused: Dr Sureshkumar Pandya admitted performing a routine labiaplasty on the woman, but denied the GMC's claims that he was acting beyond his competence and the results were the equivalent of FGM . The woman approached the Regency Clinic in east London and Dr Pandya performed a labiaplasty operation on her in March 2012, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard. Labiaplasty is the most common type of women's cosmetic genital surgery in Britain, and can be carried out on the NHS, with procedures rising fivefold in the last 10 years. It is often used to treat serious medical conditions, but its popularity has also been criticised by experts who say it encourages unnecessary surgery and a trend towards 'designer vaginas'. In November the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said it should no longer be carried out on the NHS. Procedure: The woman said she felt like self- harming after the surgery by Dr Pandya (pictured) Known only as Patient A, the woman was 'distressed and unhappy' by the results of her procedure and contacted doctors to . raise her concerns, the fitness to practise panel heard. Her own GP noted: ‘Patient was upset with the procedure, . which was not as expected, unhappy with the surgeon and did not feel she . was told the whole truth. ‘Tearful. Feels low and feels like harming herself.’ Sean Larkin QC, for the GMC, told the panel: ‘After the procedure a nurse told her she didn’t know why it had been done as it wasn’t needed. ‘She . wondered if she had been circumcised. The patient had no idea what this . meant. ‘It is quite . clear [from medical notes] that the impact of this . procedure was devastating on Patient A and caused her extreme anguish, . such that there were concerns about the state of her mental health as a . result of the procedure. ‘Coincidentally . it seems on this same day another doctor referred the case to the GMC. 'Her referral is made on the basis that Patient A had reported being . railroaded into the procedure and feeling violated and butchered . afterwards.’ The woman . underwent a number of examinations in 2012, none of . which concluded that she had undergone FGM, also known as female circumcision. It was not until last year, after she fell pregnant, that a . midwife said the result of the procedure had been virtually the equivalent of being circumcised. An expert report said the ‘anatomical result was virtually indistinguishable from FGM type I-II.’ Mr Larkin told the panel aspects of the procedure could be covered by criminal legislation. He . said they ‘would be covered by the definition of the FGM Act 2003 and . by the definition according to the World Health Organisation. 'That shows the extent to which there were these injuries.’ Intentionally performing FGM has been a criminal offence since 1985, and in 2003 the maximum sentence was increased from five to 14 years in jail. Procedure: The common operation took place at the Regency Clinic in east London in March 2012 . The panel was . told Dr Pandya occasionally performed operations at the Regency Clinic, . but despite his significant surgical experience, had not . practised gynaecology since 1994. He denied this, saying he performed the operation but that many of the other claims about his work were untrue. Patient A will not be called to give evidence to the fitness to practise panel, with it instead relying on expert witnesses and medical notes. It comes as a minister said victims in criminal FGM cases - in other words, where FGM has been performed intentionally - could be given anonymity in court, to combat the fear and shame of coming forward. Justice Minister Damian Green (pictured) told the Evening Standard today: 'The Government is committed to tackling and preventing the abhorrent practice of female genital mutilation. 'We are considering suggestions for strengthening the criminal law on FGM and we'll be looking at whether present arrangements for protecting witnesses' identities are adequate.' Dr Pandya is not accused of a criminal offence and it is not thought he has been questioned by police. Dr Pandya has already admitted performing an operation on the woman, known as Patient A. He also admitted not noting down his discussions with her about the surgery, particularly its risks. But he denied the other three allegations against him at the tribunal, which were brought by the General Medical Council. They were that he removed and damaged certain parts of the woman's genitals; that the result was the equivalent of FGM; and that he had not practised in gynaecology since 1994. This morning, the hearing in Manchester was warned there is a stark difference . between a botched operation that technically fell within the definition . of FGM, and a doctor deliberately conducting the procedure in what would be a criminal offence. The panel, chaired . by Dr Anthony Morgan, was told they can only find the allegation proved . if the doctor fully intended to perform FGM. The . hearing was told that there are thought to have been two other . regulatory cases of doctors, and one of a dentist, involving FGM, but all three related to undercover journalists making inquiries about . the procedure. ‘This is the first time that this . matter has properly been assessed and it is important for any case that . may follow to set out the ambit of female genital mutilation,’ Mr Larkin . added. Dr Pandya is currently subject to an interim conditional GMC order, originally imposed in July last year, which restricts the work he is allowed to carry out. The string of conditions keeps him closely monitored and bans him from carrying out female genital operations. The hearing continues. Banned: It is illegal to intentionally carry out FGM . To intentionally carry out FGM has been illegal since 1985, but Britain's first criminal charges were not brought until last month. Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, 31, from Ilford, east London, was working at the Whittington Hospital in north London when he was accused of carrying out the procedure. Hasan Mohamed, 40, from Holloway, north London, is accused of encouraging and helping him, prosecutors said. Both will appear before Westminster magistrates later this month. The prosecutions follow a lengthy campaign by human rights groups to raise awareness of the procedure's existence. It is thought as many as 66,000 women in the UK have suffered FGM with 24,000 girls under 11 also at risk. The tradition originated in ethnic groups spread throughout 28 African countries, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan, and spread across the world as groups emigrated. The circumcision or 'cutting' is often carried out for cultural reasons, sometimes because it shows a girl's virginity on her wedding night. FGM is defined as any partial or full removal of a woman's outer sexual organs. It can also involve sewing up the vagina.","Dr Sureshkumar Pandya performed operation at Regency Clinic, London .

"By . Luke Garratt . Police made a dawn raid on four houses which were home to a Romanian 'car fraud gang', and seized £30,000 in cash and a top-of-the-range BMW from the house at the centre of their £1 million scam. Four houses were raided in south east London, and at least two arrests were made as a part of the targeted police operation on the Romanian gang, in a clamp down on organised economic crime. One of the houses they entered was thought to be an 'ID factory' where gang members were creating fake documents to open bank accounts. Police made a dawn raid on four houses which were home to a Romanian 'car fraud gang', and seized £30,000 in cash and a top-of-the-range BMW from the house at the centre of their £1 million scam . Their scam allegedly involved bonus car adverts that were targeting thousands of motorists looking for cut priced cars on websites like Autotrader and Gumtree. The gang members allegedly stole money from the 'buyers' without ever parting with the vehicles they had advertised for sale. They are accused of then laundering the money through phoney accounts, withdrawing cash from cash points or transferring it straight out of Britain. The alleged scam is thought to have hooked its prey by offering prospective buyers the chance to put money in a holding account before the final payments, followed by a test drive so a buyer could be sure about the purchase. However, once the money transfer was made, the fraudsters would withdraw the money from the account, so the prospective buyer could not retrieve it. Police also said 'mules” were paid to open account at banks using fake documents in order to launder the proceeds of the frauds. Hundreds of ordinary Londoners looking for cars worth between £5,000 and £8,000 are thought to have been caught in the alleged scam. A 30-year-old man was arrested in Charlton and is being questioned on suspicion of fraud and money laundering. A 30-year-old man was arresting during the raid which was part of Operation Subidor. The scam allegedly involved bonus car adverts that were targeting thousands of motorists looking for cut priced cars on websites like Autotrader and Gumtree . A 63-year-old woman was also arrested, by the UK Border Agency, on suspicion of being in possession of fraudulent immigration documents. At the alleged 'ID factory' police found fake documents, two laptops, seven mobile phones and memory sticks, thought to be for use in opening fake bank accounts for money laundering. The raids were carried out as part of Operation Subidor - an initiative launched by the newly-formed London Regional Fraud Team. They were made by officers from City of London Police, Scotland Yard and British Transport Police, as well as officials from the Home Office. Head of the new squad, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Fyfe, said: 'The fact that the unit consists of detectives from the three police forces serving the London region is evidence of the wider commitment from law enforcement to really clamp down on economic crime. 'With organised crime gangs increasingly targeting people who are prepared to make large purchases online, I would expect internet-related investigations and arrests to be a major focus for us over the coming months - with many more early morning visits to the homes of key suspects.' A police spokesman said : 'Buyers who express an interest have been receiving emails, supposedly from eBay, offering to hold payment for the vehicle in an escrow account until it has been viewed and a price agreed. 'In theory, this would allow the buyer to release the funds securely rather than having to carry around thousands of pounds in cash. 'In reality, victims are finding the advert to be bogus and the money they transferred to have been quickly withdrawn - often out of cash machines -from bank accounts set-up with false details.' DCI Fyfe said: 'I want people to be . extremely cautious online and check what sort of payment or banking . facility they enter into as you don’t know who you are dealing with . until you have met them in person.'

"By . Paul Donnelley . Robert Arundel leaves court where he was ordered to pay his wife £9,000 compensation and was given a suspended sentence after he pleaded guilty to three counts of assault by beating . Jealous husband Robert Arundel narrowly avoided jail after a court heard that he treated his wife like a slave. He plotted a campaign of physical and psychological abuse against wife Michele at their remote Lake District bungalow. Arundel, 43, of Kendal, was ordered to pay £9,000 compensation and was given a suspended sentence after he pleaded guilty to three counts of assault by beating. He punched and insulted her, took her passport away, refused to allow her holidays, and forced her to work seven days a week unpaid. She also said he installed CCTV cameras to keep an eye on her. Arundel, who used to run Frydays fish and chip shop on New Road, would threaten his wife’s kittens with his dog. Lisa Hine, prosecuting, told South Lakeland Magistrates’ Court that Arundel threw a screwdriver at his wife before slapping her. CCTV footage of the attack was shown to the court, from a camera set up in the couple’s home – which Mrs Arundel copied onto her mobile phone as evidence. The court heard that one night when Arundel got home from work, he punched her about four times on the right thigh while watching TV. Chippy: Robert Arundel used to run this fish and chip shop in Kendal in the Lake District. He forced his wife Michele to week there seven days a week for no pay . However, Mrs Arundel took pictures on her phone after the assaults in August, September and October last year and kept a diary of the abuse on her iPad. But then she stopped as she did not think she would be believed. Miss Hine said on another occasion he ‘grabbed’ and bruised his wife’s finger after she raised it, thinking he was going to hit her. The court heard that Mrs Arundel, who approached police in December, now suffers from clinical depression. She described how she worked seven days a week in the chip shop for which she was not paid and received no holidays. She married Arundel in 2007 and claimed that the verbal abuse started straight away. In her victim statement, she said she believed she was being ‘monitored by CCTV cameras’ which made her feel like she was living in a prison. She was not allowed to speak to male customers, was not allowed money or a bank account of her own and had to take him a receipt if she bought anything. ‘I wasn’t allowed a passport which meant I didn’t exist, which was what he wanted,’ she wrote in her victim statement. ‘I had no means to escape. The remote Lake District cottage where Robert Arundel terrorised his wife Michele . ‘I was monitored by CCTV cameras, it was like living in a prison.’ Miss Hine said one night while the couple watched a film, Arundel turned to his wife and said: ‘I have a place to bury your body where no one will find you’. Mrs Arundel said that she left with a suitcase and moved to a refuge in Carlisle. ‘I’ve had to rebuild my life while Robert’s life has not changed,’ she said. In mitigation, Rachel Broughton said that Arundel accepted the three assaults to which he pleaded guilty. ‘This was a long standing relationship, they spent 24/7 together but had a level of accumulating debt which caused stress and fatigue for Mr Arundel, who took it out on his wife,’ she said. Arundel was no longer working as he had sold the business and was claiming benefits. Chairman of the Bench John Falvey said: ‘This was systematic, physical and psychological abuse. The only thing that has saved you from prison is your guilty plea. ‘Over the last five years you have not paid any money to your wife for her work. In my view you have treated her like a slave.’ Arundel was ordered to pay £3,000 compensation to the victim for each offence, £250 court costs and an £80 victim surcharge. He was also given a 120-day prison sentence suspended for 24 months, a restraining order and will be supervised by the Probation Service for 24 months. He must also complete a Building Better Relationships programme and an alcohol awareness course.","Robert Arundel of Lake District pleaded guilty to three counts of assault by beating .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Oklahoma police captain has been sentenced to four years in prison on Wednesday for shooting dead an unarmed teenager who was running away from him. Del City captain Randy Trent Harrison was convicted of first-degree manslaughter for shooting Dane Scott Jr in the back. The 18-year-old had been involved in a chase with Harrison, after the police captain tried to pull over his car in March 2012. Sentenced: Police Captain Randy Trent Harrison is led from the courtroom on Wednesday after being handed a four-year prison term . Victim: Dane Scott Jr was shot in the back after a scuffle with Harrison in 2012 . During a scuffle Scott pointed a handgun at Harrison's head before the police captain disarmed him. The 48-year-old had previously arrested Scott on drug violations, and prosecutors said his pursuit of the teenager had crossed the line from professional to personal. The defense portrayed Scott as a drug dealer, and said Harrison believed the teenager had been reaching for a second weapon at the time he was shot. Oklahoma County District Judge Donald Deason sentenced Harrison after the victim's parents, Dane Scott Sr, and Deloise Dockins read emotional statements describing the impact their son's death had on them. Harrison, dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit and shackled, stood nearby. Crime scene: Harrison had chased the teenager after he failed to stop when the police tried to pull him over . Prison: Harrison, left, appears in court to be sentenced over the death of Dane Scott Jr, right . Defense attorney Carolyn Merritt pleaded for Judge Deason to sentence Harrison, a 23-year veteran officer, to probation. A pre-sentencing investigation report by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections had recommended that Harrison receive probation. But District Attorney David Prater urged the judge to impose a prison sentence and said Harrison had made inconsistent statements about his actions on the day Scott died.","Randy Trent Harrison chased victim after he refused to pull over .

"By . Lucy Crossley . An Al-Qaeda leader suspected of recruiting White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite has been shot dead in Kenya. Abubakar Shariff Ahmed was killed by unidentified gunmen as he and a friend were walking from a court in Mombasa to a nearby mosque. A witness said that two gunmen had opened fire, with around 20 shots fired as Ahmed, also known as Makaburi - meaning graveyard, fell to the floor, dressed in a white checked robe. His companion was also shot dead. Killed: Al-Qaeda leader Abubakar Shariff Ahmed, who is suspected of recruiting White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite has been shot dead in Kenya . The witness said that police arrived soon afterwards, and slid the preacher's body into the back of an official pick up truck. Human rights activists' have claimed that the . Kenyan government â€” rattled by the presence of Islamic extremists in Kenya and . by the attack last year by al-Shabab on a Nairobi mall â€” was  behind the . killing, and were also responsible for the deaths of two other Muslim leaders. Ahmed . had been linked to fugitive terror suspect Lewthwaite, dubbed the White . Widow, as he helped more than 100 Britons to join Somali terrorist . group al-Shabaab, which counts her as a member. The 29-year-old British Muslim convert is . the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering . the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, . and three others with links to al-Shabaab. Link: Ahmed had been linked to fugitive terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite, dubbed the White Widow, as he helped more than 100 Britons to join Somali terrorist group al-Shabaab, which counts her as a member . Wanted: The 29-year-old British Muslim convert is the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, and three others with links to al-Shabaab . However, in September last year Ahmed denied ever having met Lewthwaite, who is the widow of of 7/7 bomber . Germaine Lindsay. Ahmed was also linked to another British fanatic, Jermaine Grant, who is currently on trial over a plot to bomb hotels. A UN investigation has suggested that Ahmed and Grant took over the Kenyan and East African leadership of Al-Qaeda in 2012. In October Ahmed told how he was 'living on borrowed time' after two other other Muslim leaders of a mosque that Makaburi was associated with were killed by unidentified gunmen in Mombasa. When he was interviewed in October, Ahmed, who was seated under a cloth bearing a hand-painted sword and religious text in Arabic, railed against the killings of radical . Muslim leaders, saying that while Kenyan security forces might think . that killing them helps snuff out radical Islam, it actually increases . the problem. Worry: In October Ahmed told how he was 'living on borrowed time' after two other other Muslim leaders of a mosque that Makaburi was associated with were killed by unidentified gunmen in Mombasa. Outspoken: In February Ahmed was pictured arguing with senior police officers outside the Masjid Musa Mosque in Mombasa, Kenya . 'Mombasa youths are looking for guns. It was nothing, then knives, and now it's guns,' he said. He . added that whoever had ordered his two friends killed would also order . his death. Police and the government have denied involvement but have . made no arrests in connection with the shootings. Yesterday the US Embassy deplored the recent violence in Kenya, including Makaburi's murder, and called for a full investigation. The US has encouraged dialogue between the government and religious leaders 'to address the underlying causes of tensions and to help counter the danger presented by violent extremist groups.' Samantha Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber . Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between . King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations. She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam. The British Muslim . convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 . people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia. Interpol . issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks . for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011. The 29-year-old is . the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering . the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, . and three others with links to al-Shabaab. On Tuesday evening, just prior to his . death, Ahmed had left a courtroom where he had helped more than two . dozen youths accused of being part of al-Shabaab. Hussien . Khalid, an official with a human rights group in Mombasa called Haki . Africa, said government agents are prime suspects in such killings. He . said 20 Muslims have been killed in the city the last four months. 'We know the government is targeting us now,' he said. 'We know our lives are in danger because we are speaking up against the atrocities they are committing to people at the coast, so they see us as the enemy to their cause, which is fraught with human rights violations.' The US State Department's report on Kenya's human rights record published earlier this year found that Kenyan security forces were responsible for the most serious human rights abuses in 2013, 'including unlawful killings, forced disappearances, torture, and use of excessive force.' Violent attacks have been increasing in Kenya. On Monday three blasts detonated in central Nairobi, killing six people Police said Wednesday they have since arrested 900 people from the Somali enclave of Nairobi. Although described by some as charismatic and intelligent, Ahmed held radical views and notably said that the four al-Shabaab gunmen who slaughtered at least 67 people in Nairobi's Westgate Mall in September 'had every right to do what they did'. 'Islamically it is justified. We cannot allow foreign forces entering Muslim countries, killing innocent Muslim people and then it go unpunished,' he said, citing Kenya's military presence in Somalia and the need for an 'eye for an eye' defense of Muslim life. A July report from the UN Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea accused Ahmed of maintaining ties to a Kenyan terror group known as al-Hijra and said he wanted terrorist attacks to be deadlier. Speaking in October, Ahmed said he was bound by the Quran to avenge the killings of his two friends, Sheik Aboud Rogo and Sheik Ibrahim Ismael. 'We will kill the people who killed them,' he said. He argued that Muslims in Kenya have no other recourse. 'There is no law here. We are in the jungle,' he said. 'We cannot see our fellow Muslims being slaughtered in front of their children and wives and not do anything. We are the ones being terrorised here.'

"By . Sarah Bull . They were never going to be understated when it came to raising their daughter. And Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland started as they mean to go on as they made their public debut with their little girl in London on Wednesday. The new parents looked undeniably proud as they pushed along three-week-old Sophia in a customised, Swarovski crystal-encrusted Silver Cross pram while out in the sunshine in the capital. Only the best! Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland stepped out with daughter Sophia in a customised, crystal-encrusted pink Silver Cross pram in London on Wednesday . Doting: Tamara and Jay looked like the picture of parental bliss as they strolled along with Sophia in the sunshine . Personalised: . The pram also had the name 'Sophia' in a name plate on the front - in . case there is any doubt over who it belongs to . While it is not clear just how much . pram's customisation cost, just the Silver Cross - the iconic Balmoral . pram - itself costs a staggering £1,450. And while there are several companies in the UK who offer the customisation, it wouldn't have come cheaply for the heiress to get the pram changed to her liking. However, Tamara didn't actually pay for her pram herself as it was a gift - from her sister Petra. Bling: The pram itself, the Balmoral, costs £1,450 - while the customisation would have been more - including the baby's 'Sophia' nameplate would have been more . Fit for an Ecclestone princess: Sophia is riding in style in her blingtastic baby carriage . The Balmoral pram has been popular among celebrities for years, with stars including Lily Allen splashing out on the designs for their children. It not only looks good but boasts a hand-sprung chassis, is cushioned with leather suspension straps and features handspoked wheels. The transport also includes a lever operated brake system, a soft foam mattress for maximum comfort and an extremely large chrome shopping basket. While the pink hood and apron come as standard on the pram, it is the crystallised pink and silver detailing on the body of the pram that Tamara would have had to pay extra for. The pram also features a silver nameplate which read 'Sophia' on the front - just in case there is any doubt as to who is belongs to. Despite only giving birth to Sophia on 17th March, Tamara already appeared to have snapped back into shape. Are you ok in there? Tamara and Jay couldn't help but coo over their little charge mid-stroll . In 1877, inventor William Wilson created Silver Cross because of a lack of suitable buggies for his own children. He opened a small workshop in Silver Cross Street, Leeds, where he grew the business with the help of his three sons. In 1913, it became the official royal pram, and a special edition was created and sent to George VI for Princess Elizabeth, who is now Queen. After moving to larger premises, an old silk factory in Guiseley, it has grown to a worldwide brand, with more than 10million parents having bought one in more than 50 countries. Tamara's Balmoral pram from the Vintage Collection costs £1,450. The Kensington style starts at £950. The 29-year-old socialite showed off her post-baby body in a striped black and grey jumper with a pair of three-quarter length black leggings and pink Nike trainers for the outing on Tuesday. With her make-up and hair completely flawless, it's hard to believe that Tamara is a first time mother. Speaking to Hello! magazine recently about parenthood, Tamara said: 'Motherhood is the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I'm enjoying every minute of it. 'I knew I would love it - I just didn't know how much. I feel born to be a mother. 'Although I've always wanted children, . I've never felt that intensely before. But Sophia has turned my world . upside down in an amazing way and I've never been happier. 'Having my own . family with Jay is just perfect.' How did she do that?

"By . Paul Donnelley . A silent film long thought lost has been found in a disused cinema in Holland. The 90-minute film, Love, Life And Laughter, was released in June 1923 by director George Pearson and starred Betty Balfour, the biggest British female star of the era who was nicknamed the Queen of Happiness. It tells the story of a poor writer and an actress and their dreams of becoming rich and successful. 'Britain's answer to Mary Pickford': Betty Balfour as chorus girl Tip-toes in Love, Life and Laughter (1923) George Pearson directed Betty Balfour in Love, Life And Laughter (1923); a copy of the film was found in a former cinema in Hattem, Holland by a property developer . Betty Balfour, Britiain's most popular actress in the 1920s, gazes out on London in the 1923 film Love, Life And Laughter . Dutch film museum Eye in Amsterdam. Curators there were sent film cans from a disused cinema In Hattem and found a copy of Love, Life & Laughter, a film thought long lost . Only one other film by Pearson survives in its entirety – Squibs Wins the Calcutta Sweep – and Love, Life and Laughter was included in the British Film Institute's (BFI) most wanted list of lost films. The film comes from an era when silent feature films were being made for Britain. The following year, the majority of British studios went bankrupt in the financial crisis and bailiffs were sent in to remove film stock, which was then burned or recycled. It is thought that 80 per cent of British silent films are lost. It was found in old film cans in a former cinema in the Dutch town of Hattem as the building was being redeveloped. The developer passed the cans on to experts at Eye, the Dutch film museum. He thought that they might contain films from the Second World War. Eye’s curators recognised its importance. Bryony Dixon, the silent film curator at the BFI archive, said: ‘This is a major discovery featuring Betty Balfour, the biggest female star of the silent period. It is also a rare survival of the work of George Pearson, one of Britain's most talented directors of this time whose First World War drama Reveille is another film on the BFI’s most wanted list. ‘Contemporary reviewers and audiences considered Love, Life And Laughter to be one of the finest creations of British cinema, it will be thrilling to find out if they're right. We hope to be able to acquire some material from our colleagues at EYE soon so that British audiences can have a chance to see this exciting discovery.’ Publicity brochure for Love, Life And Laughter, the Betty Balfour starring vehicle which has long been thought to have disappeared . Miss Dixon added that Pearson was one of Britain's most talented silent film directors. ‘He launched Balfour's career and it is this film that really pushed her in to that stellar arena. She was our biggest star of the silent era. She was much loved and had that common touch, she was quite ordinary and she played on it.’ Pearson made many films with Balfour, in part because he had a crush on her – he was devastated when she refused to marry him. Balfour, who died in 1977, plays a chorus girl called Tip-Toes in the film who dreams of becoming a music hall star. She made her name playing a comic character called Squibs in a popular series of films, also directed by Pearson, which were huge hits in Holland as well as the UK. Born at Chester-le-Street, Durham in March 1903, Betty Balfour began acting on the stage when . Betty Balfour (left) with Jessie Matthews during filming of Evergreen . she was just 10 and even took over from Gertrude Lawrence on stage in The Midnight Follies. Balfour was the most popular actress in Britain in the 1920s. She appeared in the popular Squibs comedy series produced by George Pearson who was in love with her although it was not reciprocated. Their professional partnership ended when she turned down his marriage proposal. She starred in Alfred Hitchcock’s Champagne (1928) but her talkies debut, The Nipper (1930), based on Squibs, was only moderately successful. She did not mature into a character actress and her career floundered to the extent that in 1952 she attempted suicide. She spent the last 25 years of her life living quietly out of the spotlight. She died at Weybridge, Surrey in November 1977 aged 74.","Love, Life And Happiness stars Betty Balfour who was nicknamed Queen of Happiness .

"By . John Hall . A beauty queen turned lawyer who was . jailed for a drunken hit-and-run has written a letter to her victim saying she is 'really, really sorry' - but insisted she had no idea she had hit him. Kristina Long, 26, was jailed for 12 . months after being found guilty of crashing into museum technician David . Robinson, catapulting him 80 feet into the air, while she was driving . home drunk from a work Christmas party held at the Reebok Stadium in . Bolton. Although he claims she initially refused to take the blame for his extensive injuries, Mr Robinson said Long had now written to him to apologise after his lawyers demanded she help pay for his recovery from fractures to the neck, spine, pelvis and leg, and bleeding on the brain. 'Really, really sorry': Although he claims she initially refused to take the blame for his extensive injuries, Mr Robinson said Kristina Long (pictured) had now written to him to apologise . Prison: Kristina Long (left) was jailed for 12 months after being found guilty of crashing into museum technician David Robinson (right) while driving home drunk from a work Christmas party . Long, who competed in international . beauty pageants while at university, was jailed for 12 months in February and is currently held at Styal women’s prison in Cheshire. She had been driving at twice the legal . drink drive limit when she crashed into Mr Robinson and left him for dead at a pedestrian . crossing in Salford on December 15, 2012. Speaking today, Mr Robinson said: 'I was upset by the way she drove off and left me - that is the thing that resonates and is the most painful thing about it all. Describing his reaction to her letter, he added: 'She didn’t really seem to take responsibility for it all, she kept saying she just had two glasses of wine but she was double the legal limit and that was quite a while after driving that they had tested her. 'During her court case she implied she had panicked but in a letter she sent me she said she was very sorry... She said said she was really, really sorry for what happened to me and that she had only had two glasses of wine and that she didn’t know she had hit something.' 'But I don’t actually believe that. One thing that came out of the trial is to see the photograph of the car damage and it was clearly a hard hit.' Denial: Long, who was a trainee lawyer at the time of the crash, was arrested two hours later but spent up to a year claiming she was not responsible for the hit-and-run . Badly hurt: Mr Robinson said Long wrote to him to apologise after his lawyers demanded she help pay for his recovery from fractures to the neck, spine, pelvis and leg and bleeding on the brain . The accident happened when Long was driving a group of friends home from a Christmas party their employer had organised at the Reebok Stadium in . Bolton. Long had just entered a 20mph zone but was traveling at 30mph when a friend . started vomiting in the back seat of her Vauxhall Corsa due to the . effects of alcohol. Distracted, Long collided with Mr Robinson and then continued her journey into . Manchester City Centre, leaving Mr Robinson lying badly injured in the . road until a passing motorist called an ambulance. In court Long said she knew she had 'hit someone', which appears to contradict what she wrote in her letter. Mr Robinson spent a month in Salford Royal Hospital with two fractures to his . spine, two fractures to his leg which required surgery, a pelvic . fracture, neck fractures and a bleed to the brain. Long, . who was a trainee lawyer at the time of the crash, was arrested two . hours later and spent up to a year claiming she was not responsible for . the hit-and-run. Kristina Long was jailed for 12 months and disqualified from driving for two years at Manchester Crown Court after being found guilty of crashing into David Robinson (right) while over the alcohol limit . Speeding: Long (right) was travelling at 30mph in a 20mph zone when she crashed into David Robinson . But in February she was jailed for 12 months after she pleaded guilty to dangerous . driving causing serious injury, failing to stop at the scene of a . collision, and driving with excess alcohol. She was also disqualified from driving for two years, but told the court she had no intention of driving again anyway. In March it emerged that Mr Robinson’s lawyers at Irwin Mitchell were taking . legal action over the accident and were currently agreeing a figure with . Long’s insurers to pay for his recovery. Mr Robinson, a bachelor who creates displays at Salford Museum and was walking home from his own Christmas party at the time of the accident, has already needed several operations and external frames to be fitted to help with his recovery and faces a long rehabilitation battle. Describing his recovery, he said: 'At the time of the accident I had booked a ski holiday and was very happy with the way my life was going.' 'I don’t remember anything about the impact itself but I had to spend the next 10 months having additional surgeries to correct his right leg which was fractured in many places.' 'I basically had a broken neck and obviously the brain injury so we didn’t know if I was going to be able to lead a normal life... I had a metal frame around my leg with steal pins going into the bones. 'I couldn’t walk and it could be incredibly painful. Some of the breaks didn’t heal properly so then I had to have another metal frame with metal wires through the bone. Long won beauty pageant Miss Bolton and also represented Northern Ireland in a beauty pageant in South Korea before turning her attention to law, where she got a job at UK firm Keogh's . Banned: Long pleaded guilty to a series of driving offences and was jailed for a year, as well as being disqualified from driving for two years. She told the court she had no intention of driving again anyway . Drunk: Long, who competed in international beauty pageants while at university, was driving at twice the legal drink drive limit when she crashed into Mr Robinson at a pedestrian crossing in Salford . 'I used to love swimming, walking my dog and running before the crash but I am not mentally quite as fast I think. I am just trying to go through normal life using pain killers and I plan ahead any activities I do now otherwise I will be laid up for a couple of days, Mr Robinson said. ‘I think the year sentence seems about right, even though she will do less than six months actual time. I don’t think she would have benefited from being in prison for any longer,' he added. 'I suppose I feel slightly sorry for her and that she has had to go to prison but then I do feel irritation about the process of law and her pleading not-guilty... A person able to take responsibility would have just said 'well yes I am guilty'.' During . the trial, Manchester Crown Court was told Long had spent four hours drinking wine . and vodka at a work party held at Bolton’s Reebok Stadium by her law . firm Keogh’s. When it was revealed that Mr Robinson would be seeking damages, his . lawyer Matt Brown said: 'This was a horrific accident that could have . been avoided had the defendant driver thought about the possible . consequences of her actions. Long was jailed for 12 months at Manchester Crown Court after she pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing serious injury, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and driving with excess alcohol . Event: Long was driving home over the limit after a work Christmas party at Bolton's Reebok Stadium (pictured) when she hit Mr Robinson at more than 30mph in a 20mph zone . 'Drink . driving is extremely dangerous and this case highlights the impact it . has on the innocent victims that are left seriously injured,' Mr Brown added. 'Also . in this case the defendant failed to take responsibility for her . actions and cruelly pleaded not guilty for a long period of time before . changing her plea very late in the day.' 'This . dragged the criminal proceedings out far longer than necessary having a . further impact on David and his family as they were unable to fully . concentrate on his recovery.' Police found 45mg of alcohol . on Long's breath almost two hours after the incident - meaning she was . likely to have be at least 61mg in her body at the time of the crash. The legal limit is 35mg. Long's car was also severely damaged from the impact with Mr Robinson. Long, . from Altrincham in Greater Manchester but originally from Belfast, . competed in World Miss University in 2010 representing Northern Ireland, . where she won the 'Miss Speech' award. After graduating she became a lawyer at Keogh’s.","Kristina Long had been driving home from work Christmas party in Bolton .

"By . Richard Spillett . A young couple were given a bizarre early-morning wake up call when a sealed can of baked beans suddenly exploded in their kitchen. Ben Leo and his girlfriend Rhian Wade said they thought a bomb had gone off when they woke to the sudden noise at 3am in the morning. But they were left confused after a late-night search last Saturday failed to find the source of the loud bang. The can of baked beans, bought from supermarket Lidl, suddenly exploded in the cupboard of Worthing's Ben Leo and Rhian Wade . After going back to sleep, Mr Leo went to make a meal the next day and found the exploded tin of baked beans, bought from Lidl, in their kitchen cupboard. Mr Leo, 24, from Worthing, West Sussex, said: 'We had no idea what it was and at 3am we were very confused and tired. 'It sounded like a small bomb had gone off in the house somewhere. The next day I went to make some lunch and opened the cupboard to find the beans everywhere. 'The can had somehow expanded and blown its top. Instead of having beans on toast for lunch I had to clean them up.' Mr Leo said the tin was still in date and had only just been bought from a nearby store. The couple said they thought a bomb had gone off due to the loud bang created when the baked bean can exploded . Lidl say they have strict quality controls in place and will be contacting their supplier to investigate the explosion . He told of his fears he could have been 'seriously injured' if the beans had not been in the cupboard. He said: 'It's pretty scary to think what could have happened if I had been looking through the cupboard when the tin exploded. 'The tin is extremely sharp and it could have left me badly cut or severely bruised - I could have been seriously injured. You wouldn't have expected this from something as innocent as a tin of baked beans. 'But thankfully we are both safe and we'll definitely think twice about where we buy our baked beans from now.' Budget supermarket Lidl has moved to assure other customers and says it will launch an investigation into the explosion. A spokesman said: 'We have strict quality control processes in place with our suppliers and, as such, take these matters extremely seriously. 'We would ask that the packaging is returned to us so that we may begin all relevant investigations into this, along with our supplier.'","Ben Leo and girlfriend Rhian Wade were rocked from their sleep by the bang .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Jennifer Lopez recently made headlines for serenading the oppressive ruler of Turkmenistan and now a human rights group says it’s not the first time she’s shaken her famous derriere for the world’s most notorious thugs. Human Rights Foundation criticized Lopez’s June 29 rendition of ‘Happy Birthday’ for President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov and now the group claims she’s taken money to perform for at least three other leaders and businessmen of ill repute. While Jenny from the Block was paid a reported $1.5 million for the Turkmenistan gig that was hosted by China National Petroleum, Human Rights Foundation says she’s made a total of $10 million from that and other questionable bookings. Scroll down for video . Ta da! Jennifer Lopez gives birthday performance for Turkmenistan president Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov June 29. Lopez is under fire for taking over $1M from the notoriously repressive leader . ‘J.Lo has repeatedly mingled with and entertained some of the world’s worst thugs and their cronies,’ Human Rights Foundation president Thor Halvorssen said in a statement. Berdimuhamedow has been criticized for oppressive rule by human rights organizations. Human Rights Watch describes Turkmenistan as ‘among the most repressive in the world.’ According to Human Rights Foundation, other leaders and businessmen with a history of human rights violations for whom Lopez has performed include Telman Ismailov, a Russian oligarch widely accused of corruption, and a 2011 performance for Uzbek industrialist Azam Aslanov at the wedding of his son. Lopez was booked to sing happy birthday to another man, an allegedly corrupt Russian bureaucrat named Alexander Yolkin. She was paid $2 million for the gig, but it never happened because Yolkin was arrested the day before Lopez was slated to perform. Easy money? A still from a Youtube shows Jennifer Lopez during her 2011 performance at the lavish wedding of the son of corrupt Uzbek industrialist Azam Aslanov. She was reportedly paid $1 million for the gig . Notorious: President Berdymukhamedov's country has been called 'among the most repressive in the world' by human rights groups but he's not the first corrupt leader J.Lo has performed for . The dictatorship of Azerbaijan, reports Human Rights Foundation, paid Lopez $2.5 million in 2012 to perform for a FIFA soccer tournament. The event was rescheduled for 2014, however Lopez and her representation reportedly met with the wife of the country’s dictator to negotiate a partnership in a proposed Azerbaijan music festival. Human Rights Foundation also criticized Lopez for taking a leg of her 2012 tour to Belarus, a country the group calls ‘Europe’s only dictatorship.’ Lopez's publicist responded to the row over the Turkmenistan event, and said the gig was vetted by the performer’s staff: ‘Had there been knowledge of human rights issues any kind, Jennifer would not have attended.’ However, her representation has yet to . comment on Human Rights Foundation’s latest accusations and MailOnline . could not reach publicist Mark Young for further comment as of Sunday . evening. Other instanes: In 2006, Lopez performed for Russian mogul Telman Ismailov, an ostentatious man often accused of corruption and known to be despised by the Russian government . Though Lopez appears to be more active in her overseas performances for the world’s wealthy, she is not the only celebrity to face criticism for showing up to photo-ops with dubious leaders. In 2011, Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank profusely apologized after attending a birthday party for Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who had been accused of torture and killings; she said she didn't have a full understanding of the event. Swank fired several members of her publicity team shortly after the incident. Interesting, Kadyrov was also in attendance at the 2011 Uzbekistan event where Lopez sang.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Country star Trace Adkins' estranged wife has set the scene for a bitter divorce by obtaining a restraining order preventing him from 'harassing, threatening or assaulting' her. Rhonda Adkins, the mother of the singer's three young daughters, has obtained a wide-ranging temporary restraining order from a Tennessee court, in which neither she nor the singer are allowed to take their children outside the state and sell or borrow against marital property. Rhonda filed for divorce in Tennessee after the couple officially separated on Monday - but now most definitely means business after it was today reported that Trace had fallen for actress Victoria Pratt. Scroll down for video . It is over: Trace Adkins wife Rhonda, pictured here last year, filed for divorce on Wednesday .

The publication claimed Trace - who went to rehab for drinking - had fallen off the wagon more than a year ago. It was also claimed that Trace had even told his wife he had fallen for curvaceous Canadian D-list actress Victoria Pratt, 43, who he met while filming The Virginian last spring. The blonde actress tweeted from the set: 'Gave Trace Adkins a sponge bath at work today…” Pratt boasted on March 30. “I owe the universe big time! #best job ever.' When filming wrapped and Trace, 52, went on to star on All Star Celebrity Apprentice, Victoria was his biggest fan, eagerly tweeting recaps of the show, with flirty jibes aimed at the singer.

Landlady Briony MacMillan, 61, said: 'I was surprised and thrilled - it's a nice accolade to have. 'To put it on a par with somewhere like Jamaica, you can't go wrong really, but it should be number one. 'We are in a fantastic location, where you can only get to on foot or by boat, we are starting to get very well known worldwide.'

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . This pint-sized hideaway could be the ultimate holiday destination for any Lord of the Rings fans. The tiny two-bedroom Secret Holt in Haytor, Devon, is set among a Scots Pines forest on land once owned by JRR Tolkien's family. The family - thought to be on Tolkien's wife's side - once lived in the now owner's home, located just a few meters from the alpine cottage. Kitsch charm: The Secret Holt in Haytor, Devon, in hear land once owned by JRR Tolkien . Secluded: The two-bedroom cabin is set among a Scots Pine forest . The now owner believes the legendary author visited the area when he was in his seventies when he and his wife Edith had moved to Bournemouth. The cabin, featured on Unique Home Stays, is surrounded by streams and miles of moorland and rainbows and is perfect for outdoorsy types looking for the ultimate get-away. The property is decorated throughout in a folksy-chic style with kitsch accessories. The master king-size bedroom includes a sky light so holidaymakers can lay in bed and look up at the branches of the surrounding ancient trees. Perfectly formed: The kitchenette is made from ancient granite and tiles from the Empire State Building . Eating well: The property may be small, but there's enough room for a dining table . The en suite bathroom has a double ended roll top bath and heated towel rails offering guests a cosy place to pamper. There is also a four-poster double bedroom usually used as a dressing room - but could be used for a second bedroom for younger members of the family. The kitchenette is made from an ancient piece of granite, and the cupboard doors are . fronted with tin wall tiles from the Empire State Building. The tiles were bought by the owner from a tile dealer in Devon who had purchased a large amount of them directly from the States. The dealer claims the tiles had been taken off the building or were being kept as spares. The tiles were then recycled into the unique cupboard fronts in the Secret Holt. The cabin has a small but perfectly formed garden that sits above the cabin boasting views across the woodlands. Cosy: The home includes a wood-burning stove and has a bright and fun interior throughout . Sleep tight: The home has two bedrooms, one with wooden features pictured . The cabin has a fire pit - perfect for enjoying as night falls in the woods armed with marshmallows for toasting. The cottage is located in the eastern part of Dartmoor, just off the abandoned . Templar Granite Tramway. The tramway was built in 1820 to move granite from Devon to the Stover Canal, where it would then be transported elsewhere. Unusually, the track was formed of granite sections, shaped to guide the wheels of horse-drawn wagons. Facilities: The larger of the two bedrooms has an en suite bathroom, pictured . Great outdoors: The property includes a lovely outside seating area looking over the forest, pictured . Charming: The Secret Holt is set in the woodlands with lots of nature all around . It is also near to the entrance of a Magnetic Iron Ore Mine - that had been mined since the Bronze Age. The cabin's owner said: 'Dartmoor is beautiful, even in rain the rainbows are magical. People come here to escape and recover in the romance and tranquility. 'It´s a joy to eat really well in all the local pubs. Guests feel they've been cradled in the top of the world and that’s part of the secret of the cabin.' Cost of renting the Secret Holt is £785 for a week stay, £620 for a 3 night weekend stay in low season. High season is £1430 for a week stay, £940 for a 3 night weekend stay. 'Father of high fantasy': J.R.R. Tolkien pictured in 1967 . John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, CBE, was an English author, poet and philologist. His family and relatives lived in the main house up the lane from The Secret Holt. He didn’t have many relatives as he was orphaned at 16 and only had one sibling. The owners of the cottage say he visited the property towards the end of his life - when he and his wife Edith lived in Bournemouth. He was a professor at Pembroke and Merton Colleges, Oxford from 1925 to 1959. He was a friend of C. S. Lewis as they were both members of the Inklings - a literary discussion group. However, he is best known for his works The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. While there were many fantasy authors before . Tolkien, the success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings is often said to have created a bit of a come-back for the genre. Some even say the author was the 'father' of high fantasy. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972. He died in 1973, aged 81, and is buried at Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford. After his father's death, Tolkien's son Christopher published a number of works based on his father's extensive unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings form a connected body of invented languages, tales, poems and literary essays about a world called Arda and Middle-earth. In 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of The 50 greatest British writers since 1945. With Forbes ranking him the 5th top-earning  dead person of note in 2009.","Tiny Dartmoor cabin in Haytor Devon set among a Scots Pines forest .

"By . Matt Blake . Disgraced governor Mark Sanford begged his ex wife to run his congressional campaign - four years after she caught him cheating on her with an Argentinian journalist. The love-cheat politician made the offer to Jenny Sanford after he announced his push for South Carolina's open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in January,  amid speculation that she planned to run for the same office herself, according to the New York magazine. But Ms Sanford, who acted as his campaign manager for free while the pair were married, is understood to have turned him down, preferring to instead continue 'serving on the boards of various charities'. 'According to Jenny,' the publication reported, 'she had already told Mark she would be taking a . pass on the race the day before, at the funeral of a mutual friend. South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford arrives with his wife Jenny at a White House dinner on February 22, 2009. Sanford admitted to cheating on his wife several months later . Candidate: Sanford is expected to announce next week that he is running for Congress . 'So . when Mark came to visit her, he arrived with a proposal. “Since you’re . not running, I want to know if you’ll run my campaign,” he said. “We . could put the team back together.” 'Jenny told him, in so many words, that wasn’t going to happen. Mark made one last appeal. '“I could pay you this time,” he said.' The South Carolina seat was left . vacant by Tim Scott when he was appointed to the Senate. Scott replaced . Sen.

South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford wipes his eyes as he speaks to the media about his trip to Buenos Aires, Argentina and admits to an extramarital affair . He was once thought to be a potential . 2012 presidential contender, but his political aspirations were dashed . when he was caught cheating on his wife in 2009. The scandal surfaced after Sanford, a father of four, mysteriously vanished on June 18, 2009 for six days. Sanford had told his staff that he . had gone hiking on the Appalachian Trail, but in reality, he was off in . Buenos Aires cavorting with his Argentinian mistress, Maria Belen . Chapur. His hiking story eventually foiled and his affair was revealed. He later admitted to visiting Chapur and said Chapur was his 'soul mate.' Maria Belen Chapur, Sanford's ex-mistress and now his fiancee, walks to her apartment after shopping at a supermarket in Buenos Aires . 'I've been unfaithful to my wife,' Sanford said at the time. 'I developed a relationship with what started as a dear, dear friend from Argentina.' Sanford said he wanted to try and mend his relationship with Jenny, his wife of 21 years, but she filed for divorce shortly thereafter. Sanford's affair didn't stop him from seeing out the end of his term for governor after South Carolina lawmakers unsuccessfully called for his impeachment following the revelations. He was eventually forced to pay $74,000 in ethics fines after the state ethics commission discovered Sanford's use of state planes and campaign cash to orchestrate his affair.

These are the men accused of murdering Roger Pratt during a bungled robbery in St Lucia . The men are accused of stealing a fishing boat and rowing out to the Warwickshire couple's £200,000 yacht, where they demanded valuables and cash . Yesterday afternoon, four men were brought to the courthouse in Vieux Fort in handcuffs. The suspects, dressed in shorts and t-shirts and in their twenties, tried to cover their faces as they were led out of a police van. Detectives said the men were known to police for 'petty crimes', including theft. The men are accused of stealing a fishing boat and rowing out to the Warwickshire couple’s £200,000 yacht, where they demanded valuables and cash. They brutally beat the holidaymakers, but swam away from the scene empty-handed, after seemingly panicking when the robbery turned violent, police said. Yesterday, the men sat with their heads bowed as the charges of ‘murder and robbery’ were read out in court. Magistrate Robert Innocent remanded them in custody until next month, when a preliminary hearing will take place. As they were led from the court, the sister of the one of the suspects screamed at police officers.

One of the men, in a checked shirt, took off his ring and handed it to a relative before being forced into a police van. The men were named in court as Kervin Devaux, Franis Joseph, Richie Khern, and Jeromine Jones. The men all live in a ‘swampy’ shanty town called Bruceville, half a mile from the bay where Mr and Mrs Pratt anchored their yacht in Vieux Fort, police said. Detectives arrested five men after receiving ‘intelligence from the local community’, but only four have been charged. Mr and Mrs Pratt were halfway through a dream year-long sailing trip around the world when the attack occurred. Mrs Pratt, 60, who suffered two black eyes and bruising to her cheekbones during the assault, did not attend yesterday’s hearing. The retired management became separated from her husband during the assault and found him floating in the water.

"By . Sophie Tedmanson . It is the roo that could change history: a tiny drawing depicting what looks like one of Australia’s most famous marsupials nestled among some branches has been discovered in a 400-year-old Portuguese manuscript. The sketch of what is thought to be a ‘canguru’ (kangaroo in Portuguese) was found in the document, dated between 1580 and 1620, which was acquired by the Les Enluminures Gallery in New York from a rare book dealer in Portugal. The Dutch ship Duyfken, which landed in Australia in 1606, was thought to been the first European ship to dock on the mainland. However the discovery of the long-lost manuscript has led historians to believe that images of kangaroos had been circulating for decades before then. A tiny drawing of a kangaroo curled in the letters of a 16th-century Portuguese manuscript could rewrite Australian history . The 16th century drawing was proof that the artist had either been in Australia or heard reports about the country and its native animals from other western European travellers, according to Les Enluminures researcher Laura Light. ‘A kangaroo or a wallaby in a manuscript dated this early is proof that the artist of this manuscript had either been in Australia, or even more interestingly, that travellers' reports and drawings of the interesting animals found in this new world were already available in Portugal,’ Ms Light told the Sydney Morning Herald. ‘Portugal was extremely secretive about her trade routes during this period, explaining why their presence there wasn't widely known.’ The manuscript also features of male figures adorned in tribal dress, baring naked torsos and crowns of leaves in the text, which Ms Light said could depict Aborigines. Native: Kangaroos are one of Australia's most distinctive animals and experts believe that the drawing could prove Europeans landed in Australian earlier than first thought . The pocket-sized manuscript contains text and music for a liturgical procession. It is inscribed with the name Caterina de Carvalho, who is believed to be a nun from Caldas da Rainha in western Portugal. Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon has long been credited with being the first European to discover Australia when he docked the Duyfken at the mouth of the Pennefather River on the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland in 1606. Some historians, including author Peter Trickett, have long debated that the coast of Australia was actually first mapped by a Portuguese maritime expedition nearly a century before the Dutch landing. ‘It is not surprising at all that an image of a kangaroo would have turned up in Portugal at some point in the latter part of the 16th century. It could be that someone in the Portuguese exhibition had this manuscript in their possession,’ Mr Trickett told the paper. Other historians theorised that the drawing could be the result of expeditions made by Portuguese explorer Jorge de Menezes to New Guinea – which has similar flora and fauna to northern Queensland where the Duyfken landed – in 1526. National Library of Australia curator of maps Martin Woods said the kangaroo-like image was not proof enough to rewrite history as it could actually depict a number of other animals from south-east Asia. ‘People will continue to look, but for now, unfortunately the appearance of a long-eared big-footed animal in a manuscript doesn't really add much,’ he told the paper. The Les Enluminures gallery will exhibit the manuscript - valued at $US15,000 ($16,600) - as part of a new exhibition Sacred Song: Chanting the Bible in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.","Drawing was found in a document which was bought by a New York gallery .

"By . Mia De Graaf . This Indian villager is addicted to eating bricks, gravel and mud, stomaching at least three kilos of his surroundings every day. Pakkirappa Hunagundi, 30, first developed a taste for the seemingly inedible objects at the age of ten. Ever since, he has snacked on walls and streets of Karnataka, India - and claims to suffer no ill effects. Scroll down for video . Addicted: Pakkirappa Hunagundi has been eating the brick, gravel and mud of Karnataka, India, for years . Despite suffering from the condition since the age of 10, Mr Hunagundi claims to have no digestive side effects . The bizarre eating . disorder is thought to be a form of Pica, an illness which gives sufferers an appetite for substances without any nutritional . value. Sporting a full set of normal-looking teeth, Mr Hunagundi blasts any suggestion he should curb the addiction. He said: 'I have been eating bricks and rocks for around 20 years now. I love eating them. It has become a part of my life. 'I started at the age of 10. Now it feels like a necessity to me. I can skip meals, but not bricks or mud. 'I have suffered no side effects. My teeth are absolutely fine. I can bite into the hardest stone without a problem.' The condition is believed to be a form of Pica, which gives sufferers an appetite for seemingly inedible objects . Despite numerous attempts by doctors and his mother to curb his addition, Mr Hunagundi loves it . Write caption here . His mother has spent 20 years trying to dissuade her son from eating away parts of their house and village. But Mr Hunagundi says the the building material tastes 'A1' - an Indian term for the best. Branding it better than 'divine nectar', he says it is best served with a glass of water. He said: 'Other than bricks, mud and stones, I don't like anything else. Even if you offer me divine nectar, I won't take it. 'My mother says don't eat all this. She keeps insisting, but even if she gives me chicken fry, I don't eat it. I don't like that at all. 'I need mud and bricks to eat. I can't help my own habit.' People from all over have come to his small village in the south west of the country to see his 'skill' in action . Plated up: While others eat stir fry, Mr Hunagundi is content with building material, washed down with water . He claims he would turn down 'divine nectar' if he had the option to eat a brick, which he highly recommends . One villager said: 'I have known him since childhood. He has always eaten mud and stones since then. 'Even a tiny stone in the mouth hurts so much. But he eats mud and stones everyday with so much ease. We find it extremely strange.' After news of his brick eating spread, Mr Hunagundi has been inundated with people wanting to watch him going about his everyday activity. His mother (right) tries to serve him rice every day, but each time he refuses, telling her he is happy this way . Mr Hunagundi, a labourer, has to assure his mother that although he keeps eating the house, he can't stop . One friend said: 'He has become very famous, but he is a poor man. We wish someone would help him. 'When we see him, we feel very bad. We have tried to convince him many times, but he does not listen. We have given up now. 'We advise him not to eat. But when he comes to our field, he goes around eating mud. He relishes hot charcoal too like a snack.' Villagers say they have grown accustomed to his strange habits, which many find fascinating . Since his father died, Mr Hunagundi has to look after his family, and hopes people will pay to watch him eat brick . Mr Hunagundi, who works as a labourer in his village and struggles to make ends meet, now intends to travel the country to showcase his act. He said: 'My father died four years ago. I have to take care of my mother. We don't have any income. So I want to make use of my talent. 'I want to show people what I can do. I want to earn some money.'","Pakkirappa Hunagundi, 30, started eating debris in Karnataka, India, aged 10 .

"By . Will Stewart . A 29-year-old Moscow lawyer shot dead five people in front of his ex-girlfriend who had ended their relationship ten months ago. Several hours before his frenzied attack on Wednesday, Dmitry Vinogradov posted a hate-filled manifesto on the web vowing 'to destroy as many parts of the human compost as possible'. Shooting from a gun in each hand, his trail of destruction left three men and two women dead, and severely wounded another man and woman. Witness: Anya Kaznikova saw her colleagues shot in the head by her ex-boyfriend, ten months after she broke up with him . Ex-girlfriend Anya Kaznikova, 26, witnessed part of his sickening killing spree but was not wounded during the attack, it was reported, contradicting earlier reports in the Russian media that she had been shot. All the dead victims were shot in the head at a Moscow pharmacy company where he worked. Among his victims were her finance department colleagues who, he claimed, advised her to end their relationship. A . former World Wildlife Foundation volunteer who saved seagulls from an . oil slick in 2010, he was finally overpowered by workers and security . men after he ran out of bullets, and armed police arrived to arrest him . at the scene of his murderous attack. Killing spree: Vinogradov (left) shot dead five people at the pharmaceutical company where he worked as a lawyer. He later told police that his work colleagues were to blame for ending his relationship with Ms Kaznikova (right), who also worked at the company in Moscow . Police sources claimed the motive for his killing spree was being spurned by Ms Kaznikova, but his sinister manifesto, posted at 4.56am, drew immediate comparisons with Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik, who shot dead 69 people at a camp last year. Police say Vinogradov came to the Rigla plant at Chermyanskaya Street, Moscow, where his ex-girlfriend worked, at 9am and was allowed in as a lawyer for the company. Miss Kaznikova said Vinogradov was initially nice, buying her cinema tickets and her favourite pancakes, before becoming possessive and angry . The killer then went to the toilet where he changed into army fatigues and went out into the depot with a Saiga hunting rifle and an Italian-made Benelli shotgun. He gunned down two men on the stairs before going into his ex-girlfriend's office where he shot his other victims. In a chilling confession, he later told police: ‘We were dating for a long time but in January this year we split up. ‘I tried to get her back but failed. In March I bought a rifle and 200 bullets and a uniform. ‘My colleagues are to blame - they advised Anya to split with me. ‘I came into the office where Anya worked and said: “Hello, colleagues”, and she saw how I began to shoot all of them. ‘I wanted them to see how strong I was and then I planned to kill myself.’ His male victims were named as Alexander Biryuk, Andrei Tertiakov and Denis Moiseev, all 33, and the women were Elena Lapshina and Natalia Plekhanova, both 25. Yaroslava Sergenyuk, 24, was struck by a bullet to her chest which pierced her lung, and another which damaged her nose. She was rushed to hospital by helicopter and is fighting for her life. Nikita Strelnikov, 29, suffered bullet wounds to his lung, liver, stomach and both legs after acting as a human shield seeking to prevent bullets striking the women. Ms Kaznikova said after the attack: 'We started dating in summer last year. He made me little sweet presents, took me to the cinema but he was too romantic for me, wenever got too close. 'We finally split up in winter when he started being angry. He was really jealous. In January he sent me a text message and blamed me formaking him feel angry. He also called me rude names.' She did not speak about the shooting, though newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said she was in her office during the horrific killings. Vinogradov’s mother Elena Vinogradova revealed on Wednesday that the couple had rowed before breaking up over a romantic trip he had booked to take her to Scotland. She said: ‘He quarrelled with that girl Anya from finance department. He is from the law department. 'I understand it that his shooting was in the finance department. It is likely that they mocked him somehow. ‘Before they split up, he bought her a trip to Edinburgh, ordered everything, paid for it all, and some two days before it she said: “I'm not going”. 'He was in a horrible depression after that.’ He had been on medication to cope with his depression but had not taken it the day before the shooting. Ms Vinogradova said: ‘He was absolutely quiet yesterday,’ adding she had tried to discourage his interest in shooting. In his manifesto posted on a Russian social site which also included racist images, Vinogradov declared:  ‘I hate human society and I am disgusted to be a part of it! I hate the senselessness of human life! I hate this very life! I see only one way to justify it: to destroy as many parts of the human compost as possible. ‘This is the only right thing which everyone of us can do in his life, it is the only way to justify it, the only way to make this world better. ‘The way of surviving and self-perfection of a man is a mistake, it leads to a dead end, to destroying of all the rest, of all what is really alive. Another life: Vinogradov is pictured saving a seagull from an oil slick in 2010 as a World Widelife Foundation  volunteer . ‘Evolve! Become aware of your real . meaning and place in this world! Understand that you are aliens here, . you are the genetic rubbish which should not be here, rubbish which . appeared accidentally, as a result of a mistake in evolution, rubbish . which must be destroyed.’ One image carried the slogan 'End Racism Kill Everyone', featuring a black child with a gun. He . described his views as ‘ultra-conservative’ and also said on his site . that the ‘main thing in life’ was ‘making the world better’. He listed shooting as an interest and is believed to have legally owned the firearms he used. Hate-filled declaration: One of the images Vinogradov posted online in a manifesto several hours before his frenzied attack, vowing 'to destroy as many parts of the human compost as possible' 'I hate human society': Vinogradov posted on a Russian social site before the killings and described his views as 'ultra-conservative' One of his favourite films was listed as Natural Born Killers. He . hated television, describing it as the ‘sewage of human intellect’. His favourite quote is listed as ‘hope is the worst evil because it . prolongs human suffering’ by Friedrich Nietzsche. A police statement said: ‘Three men and two young women sitting at their desks died on the spot. ‘One more man and another young woman were wounded, they are receiving medical help.’ A source said: ‘He told investigators that he had fallen in love with a girl who was a pharmacist, but his feelings were not reciprocated. ‘Because of that he drank for five days and today he came in and opened fire.’ Another source said he would undergo psychological assessment. He said: ‘He is of course not Breivik but the analogy suggests itself.’ He graduated in 2009 from the Academic Law University in Moscow and worked as a company lawyer for the Rigla chain of pharmacies.","Dmitry Vinogradov shot dead three men and two women, injured two others including ex-girlfriend Anya Kaznikova .

"By . Allan Hall . Updated: . 10:09 EST, 19 February 2012 . Forest boy: Artist's impression of 'Ray' who claimed he lived in the wild . German authorities said the fate of the mysterious English-speaking ‘Forest Boy’ will forever remain a secret from the world. 'He wants no publicity and we have nothing more to say on this subject,' said a spokesman for youth authorities in Berlin. 'We will not enter into discussions about secrecy or otherwise. There will be no more information forthcoming on this case.' Despite the German taxpayer stumping . up close to £5,000 a month for his upkeep, the spokeswoman said that his . wishes 'come first.' But sources say his claim to have been . brought up in a forest - and to have buried his father in a shallow . grave - have been proved false. One insider said; 'He is regarded now . as a fantasist with some mental health issues. There was no wood, no . grave, no mother who died in a car crash. He is just now just something . of an unfortunate.' The German authorities will not even say where he is being kept. The boy, known only as Ray, hit the headlines in September . last year. Speaking in broken English, he walked into a town hall in the . east of Berlin and claimed to remember few details about his life. But he spun a tale - in accented English - that gripped the imagination of the world. He said he had been living in a tent . in a forest for five years with his father, called Ryan, and that his . mother Doreen had died in a car crash five years previously. He said that his father died suddenly . in the woods and he began walking towards Berlin. He said he had buried . his father among the trees. ‘I’m all alone, please help me,’ he said. Lost in translation: The boy turned up in Berlin alone and saying he had been living rough in the woods . But his tall tale soon began to develop more holes than a Swiss cheese. A check of police computers in all 16 . states of Germany found that no one by the name of Doreen had died in a . car crash in the past decade. No sign of a grave has been found in . cursory searches of forests in the Harz Mountains, along the . Bavarian-Czech border or in Thuringia. Ray is unable to pinpoint the forest where he said he lived, he is also unable to say what nationality he is. Officials originally thought he could be British because he speaks English but only basic German, although they now doubt this. The tent he carried did not look as if it had sustained five years of treatment in a forest and Ray was well dressed and clean. Wilderness: The teenager's history is shrouded in mystery and he refuses to have his picture taken . As Interpol was alerted to check with . police forces for missing people in other European countries, Ray . triggered more suspicion when he said he did not want to pose for . photographs or make an appeal to try to find any of his family. ‘They’re all dead,’ he said. ‘I just want to get on and make a new life for myself.’ A police spokesman said: . ‘Unfortunately it seems that the boy told his guardian that he wasn’t . interested in discovering who he was.’ Several people from around the world . have claimed to be his relatives, including a Swiss couple who said he . was their missing grandson. But no real relative has been found.","German authorities refuse to discuss case any further .

And while genetics and a good diet no doubt play a role in Miranda Kerr’s near perfect body, she also credits plenty of sex for her toned curves. In an interview accompanying her steamy – and nearly nude- shoot for GQ, the mother of one, who split from husband Orlando Bloom six months ago, said that regular sessions between the sheets is what has been keeping her runway ready. Scroll down for video . Miranda Kerr stripped naked and posed for a Mario Testino shoot, for GQ magazine and it is hard to see where her arms are 'less toned' The mother-of-one posed in a string vest for the shoot, speaking openly about how she credits sex with her amazing figure . 'One thing I’ve noticed is now that I’m having less sex my body isn’t as toned,’ the 30-year-old explained. ‘The more sex I have, the more defined my arms and stomach get.' However, Miranda has also spoken about how her daily 30-minute yoga sessions and a 'super healthy' diet help hone her slender 5ft 9 inch frame. So while it may be slightly unrealistic to expect that amping up the bedroom antics will miraculously give you a body worthy of a Victoria’s Secret model, there is actually some evidence to back Miranda’s erotic body secret. Medical experts have long said that making love can slow down the ageing process, improve the immune system, boost circulation and help you live longer. Miranda also is a big fan of healthy eating and does 30 minutes of yoga daily to keep her figure . Dr David Weeks, clinical neuropsychologist at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, believes the most effective way to keep your youthful looks is to maintain an active love life. In his study, Dr Weeks questioned more than 3,500 volunteers aged between 18 and 102. He concludes that couples who make love three times a week look between four and seven years younger than those who have less sex. 'Sex is an excellent aerobic exercise because it raises the heart beat and pumps oxygen around the body which improves the immune system, boosts circulation and keeps you lean,' he said. Miranda split from her husband of three years Orlando Bloom six months ago, and says since she has not been able to have regular sex she has become less toned . Although sex is not the most efficient way to lose weight, you can burn between 100 and 250 calories an hour and also exercise the major muscle groups. If you have moderately active sex twice a week, you burn an extra 5,000 calories a year - the equivalent of a 50 mile run at a slow pace. Sexual intercourse also helps keep you lean as it raises levels of insulin-like growth factors (IGF) - a hormone that controls the activity of enzymes within those cells responsible for fat metabolism. When higher levels of IGF are released, this helps to break down fatty tissue in the body and promote lean muscle instead.","Miranda Kerr credits sex with keeping her body looking perfect .

"By . Sara Nelson . Updated: . 06:07 EST, 9 November 2011 . Greek political leaders have pledged to announce a new coalition government today â€“ despite having failed to name a new prime minister. The two-day deadlock in power-sharing talks is persisting despite pressure to reach a deal from Eurozone countries which are also grappling with a crisis in nearby Italy. Cabinet members made their resignations yesterday to Socialist Prime Minister George Papandreou and government officials insist the new Greek interim administration is to be announced later today. George Papandreou (left) and conservative opposition leader Antonis Samaras (right) have failed to name the next prime minister . Following an agreement to form a 15-week coalition, Papandreou and conservative opposition leader Antonis Samaras have so far failed to name the next prime minister.In the past two days government sources have made a number of optimistic predictions about forming the government, which must secure a 130-billion-euro ($180-billion) bailout from the euro zone, only for no deal to materialise. 'Today, the prime minister will meet the president of the republic,' deputy government spokesman Angelos Tolkas said on NET radio. 'Everything will happen in such a way that after 12 (1000 GMT) we will have the announcement of the new government.' Vice President of the European Central Bank Greek Lucas Papademos (left) has been touted as a possible candidate, as has President of the European Court of Justice Vassilios Skouris (right) The socialist and conservative parties had wanted former ECB vice-president Lucas Papademos to lead the government of national unity, aiming to re-establish an international credibility that the politicians lost long ago. But sources in both parties said this was now in doubt and the two sides were looking at other options. 'The Papademos candidacy has hit problems that have to do with both parties,' one of the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Some Greek media reported that Papademos had set conditions that the parties would not accept, and others that there were objections from Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, because Papademos wanted to change the government's economic team. Greek media have mentioned parliamentary speaker Filippos Petsalnikos and socialist lawmaker Apostolos Kaklamanis as alternative premiers, but both have denied the reports that they had been picked. Demonstrators affiliated to the Left Coalition Party of Greece hold a banner reading 'End the Governments of Bankers, Austerity is the Problem not the Answer', at the entrance of the Acropolis, in Athens, Greece, yesterday . The President of the European Court of Justice Vassilios Skouris was the latest name mentioned, with a source in the ruling socialist party telling Reuters on condition of anonymity that there was a deal on his name and that Finance Minister Venizelos would keep his post. The stakes could not be higher. Greece must have a new coalition to secure the bailout, negotiate the release of emergency funds from the EU and IMF to avoid bankruptcy when big debt repayments come due next month, and safeguard its place in the euro zone. On the other hand, the European Union needs to put out the fire in Greece to prove to international financial markets that it can tackle another blaze in Italy, a far bigger economy also heading for economic and political crisis. To Vima news website expressed the exasperation felt by Greeks with all their political leaders, especially Papandreou and conservative opposition leader Antonis Samaras. The website evoked a national fear that Greece might lose its euro zone membership, and be cast adrift to survive alone with its old currency. 'Despite its huge defeat, our political system won't get serious at the time when the country is threatened with complete collapse, wavering between the euro and the drachma. 'Mr Papandreou and Mr Samaras agreed on Sunday on a government to save the country and are now doing whatever they can to undermine it before it even starts its work,' it said. Adding to the confusion, conservative leader Samaras became embroiled in a dispute within his New Democracy party and a related row with the European Union. Party political sources said some New Democracy lawmakers were accusing Samaras of giving away too much, especially when he agreed to accept austerity measures in the bailout package. Samaras had long argued that the spending cuts, tax rises and job losses imposed by the outgoing socialist government under orders from the EU and IMF had deepened Greece's crippling recession, now in its fourth year. A New Democracy party source refused to accept the party was the main problem, but acknowledged internal divisions since Samaras staged his U-turn on the package last week, helping to open the way for Sunday's agreement in principle. 'Parts of New Democracy are causing trouble. Many party officials around Samaras don't like the way things are going,' the source said on condition of anonymity. Under pressure from party dissidents, Samaras attacked the EU for demanding written undertakings from Greece that it would stand by its promises to implement the bailout package which euro zone leaders agreed last month. European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn made the demand, exasperated by Greece's record of making promises on tackling its huge debt and budget deficit and then falling short of fulfilling them. Rehn singled out a decision by Papandreou last week to call a referendum on the bailout, a vote which might have seen Greeks reject the package because of the austerity measures tied to it. Papandreou backed down, but was forced into agreeing to make way for the unity coalition. Speaking in Brussels, Rehn said Greece had breached confidence with the EU by calling the referendum. Now Brussels needed undertakings to release even the next 8-billion-euro installment of funding for Greece under its original bailout package, pulled together last year. 'This confidence needs to be mended,' said Rehn. 'Finance ministers of the euro area expect that there is ... a written commitment, a written confirmation of the commitment of a broad-based government of national unity.' A government source said the EU wanted Samaras to sign, along with the new prime minister, finance minister, central bank governor and outgoing Prime Minister George Papandreou. The New Democracy response was blunt. Samaras hinted in a statement he might give no written assurances because his spoken word was enough. 'It's a matter of national dignity ... I don't allow anybody to doubt my statements,' he said.","Coalition negotiations far from over .

During the attacks several years ago, he repeatedly tried to rape one frightened victim and committed indecent acts on the other - but neither victim went to police. Simcock later met and married Stephanie in 2008 and two years later the couple had a baby together. He was then arrested in October 2011 and charged in March 2012 after the two victims he abused many years earlier complained to police.

The victim's father, whose name was not released, told Chinese media he had refused to lend money to his younger brother - Zhang's husband - who wanted to build a house. He said Zhang lured his son down an alleyway before attacking him with a fruit knife. The boy was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach one of his ears.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . The skipper of a yacht who rescued a crew member after he was missing for 90 minutes in freezing temperatures said finding the sailor was worse than looking for 'a needle in a haystack'. Sean McCarter , 32, was a skipper on the Derry-Londonderry-Doire boat in the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race. He said his team mate would have been unconscious and possibly dead if he had not been wearing a dry suit. Andrew Taylor, 46, from London, fell overboard 2,500 miles from land and was in the ocean for an hour and a half before being rescued. Andrew Taylor spent 90 minutes in freezing, stormy seas after a huge wave knocked him off the yacht he was sailing on . The 46-year-old father from London was feared lost after he was swept out of view of his desperate crew around 2,500 miles from land this morning . Skipper Sean McCarter saved Andrew Taylor's life. Mr MrCarter admitted that the crew member who fell overboard may only have survived because he was wearing a wetsuit . Mr McCarter, a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution volunteer from near Londonderry, Northern Ireland said: 'The moment he went out of sight the Pacific all of a sudden becomes a very big place. 'We had our man overboard position marked on the chart which gives us a point to start searching from and we start going through the motions, trying to estimate where he might have drifted to with the wind and current. 'We started searching but I mean a needle in a haystack doesn’t even describe what we were looking for.' Mr Taylor has now recovered from his terrifying ordeal, which happened in the early hours of Monday morning during the amateur yacht race. It is only the fourth time in the race’s 18 year history that a competitor has fallen overboard. At the time, Mr Taylor was suffering from severe shock after being hit by the rudder of the 70ft racing yacht as it swung past him. He was also suffering from hypothermia. Miraculously, after an hour of searching in horrendous weather conditions, Mr Taylor's fluorescent life jacket was spotted (pictured) The crew then performed a daring rescue operation which saw them expertly manoeuvre the boat close enough to Mr Taylor for one team member to grab hold of him . Mr Taylor is hauled back on to the boat after spending over an hour trying to stay alive in the bitterly cold sea . Mr Taylor recovered in the boat after the rescue. It is only the fourth time in the Clipper Race's 18 year history that a competitor has fallen overboard. All crew members were recovered . 'I just heard a noise, then I got wiped out by a really big wave. That's when the storm started - God, the storm was bad, it was horrible,' he said . Mr Taylor was with Mr McCarter trying to change a head sail when the boat rolled violently and he was thrown into the water - despite being clipped on to the ship. There were 17 other crew members on the boat. Mr Taylor said: 'It happened so quickly. One second my feet were on the boat the next my head was in the water. 'There was nothing in between, it was just, bang, gone. 'There was no feeling of losing my balance or trying to get hold of something or looking for something to hang on to.' Mr Taylor was brought into the boat to warm up after the ordeal . Mr Taylor said conditions deteriorated further while he was in the ocean being tossed about by waves. A storm then struck and the sailor was hit with rain, wind and hailstones. He said: 'I got hit from behind by a really big wave. I heard it coming, white water. 'It hit me from behind, winded me, rolled me over, tipped me upside down, and rolled me over and over and over, like getting wiped out in a surf or washed up on a beach.' He said that he watched as the boat 'got further and further away' Mr Taylor was treated by an onboard medic for hypothermia and shock . 'I . just heard a noise, then I got wiped out by a really big wave. That’s . when the storm started - God, the storm was bad, it was horrible.' The yacht was about halfway through the 5,600-mile leg across the Pacific from Qingdao, China, to San Francisco when the accident happened. Mr McCarter, who has sailed from a young age, said that searching for a longstanding crew member made the rescue operation more tense. He said: 'Being a crew member on an RNLI lifeboat we respond to lots of those but there’s a certain detachment when its not somebody you know, a friend or a crew mate. 'You are just out looking for a diver in the water or somebody who has been swept off a rock. 'It’s not quite the same as somebody you were just talking with a few moments before, someone you have been sailing with for whatever it is, seven months at this stage, and ultimately somebody I am responsible for.' The crew have been praised for putting all their training to good use and following man overboard procedures to the letter. But with the conditions in the middle of the ocean, there were fears for Mr Taylor’s life. The skipper said: 'The water temperature is 10-11 degrees so you really don’t want to have someone in there for really any longer than 10-15 minutes. 'We had huge seas, very strong winds, limited visibility, because the sea state was so bad and that made it a lot more challenging. 'As soon as we saw him the initial reaction was a huge relief and then followed quite quickly by: we don’t have a clue what state he is in. God forbid dead or alive, conscious, unconscious, injured. 'We got round and as soon as he could see the boat out of the corner of his eye we could see him waving his arms and that was another massive relief. 'We got near to him and before we knew it he was instructing us how to get him back on board.' The Pacific leg of the Clipper, between China and the US, is the tenth of 16 stages in the world’s longest ocean race at more than 40,000 miles. The boat Derry-Londonderry-Doire at the start of the race in Cape Town, South Africa . Justin . Taylor, the director of the race, praised the efforts of the crew in recovering Mr Taylor. He . said: 'In these conditions a man overboard is swept away from the boat . very quickly and visual contact can be lost in the swell. 'We . have a well-rehearsed procedure to mark the position, stop racing and . engaged the engine to search for and recover the crew member as quickly . as possible. 'An hour . and a half is a very long time to be in the water in these conditions . but a combination of his sea survival training and seven months at sea . as well as wearing a life jacket and dry suit will have contributed . enormously to his survival.' Sir . Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person ever to sail round the world . alone non-stop, added: 'The sea can be a harsh environment and we . rehearse every eventuality including a man overboard. 'The procedures were put into practice flawlessly by the crew in difficult conditions. 'It is a tribute to their training and determination that Andrew was successfully recovered.'","Sean McCarter saved man's life after fell overboard in freezing Pacific .

"A husband who strangled his wife with a scarf after she told him their marriage was over has been jailed for life. Muhammed Hussain Iqbal, 29, killed Salma Parveen, 22, in the bedroom of their home after he had seen her kissing another man. Iqbal killed Salma, a bank clerk, by wrapping a scarf around her neck as she was getting ready for work on April 29 last year. Muhammed Hussain Iqbal, 29, killed Salma Parveen, 22, in the bedroom of their home after he had seen her kissing another man . He then bound her hands and feet with more scarves and hid her body in their house in Coventry, West Midlands, before fleeing on a train for London. He handed himself in to police a day later, saying: 'I come from Coventry where I’ve committed a murder.' Despite confessing to killing Salma in police interviews, Iqbal pleaded not guilty to one count of murder. But he was found guilty by a jury of four men and eight women after a three-week trial at Stafford Crown Court. He has now been jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years behind bars. Speaking after the case, sergeant Mick Griffiths, from West Midlands Police, said after the case: 'Throughout this trial Iqbal claimed that he didn’t intend to kill Salma and that he had suffered a loss of control due to provocation. 'He has changed his defence and alleged in court that Salma attacked him with a knife. 'This was pure fabrication and the jury saw through these lies. 'Their relationship had broken down and Salma wanted him to leave the family home. 'Iqbal chose his moment carefully and then struck. Salma had no chance to defend herself and he killed her in a fit of temper.' The court heard the couple married in an Islamic ceremony in 2012 but to secure Iqbal’s visa - which expired this year - he wanted to tie the knot in a civil ceremony. But he became enraged when he found out Salma - who had been having an affair with a city councillor for over three years - had cancelled the wedding just weeks before her death . The jury were told Salma was murdered within hours of Iqbal allegedly seeing her kissing another man. Married Coventry councillor Kamran Caan admitted to the court he had an affair with the 22-year-old which started in 2009 or 2010. Despite confessing to killing Salma in police interviews, Iqbal pleaded not guilty to one count of murder. But he was found guilty by a jury of four men and eight women after a three-week trial at Stafford Crown Court . The Labour representative for Upper Stoke called Salma his 'Cinderella' in text messages but said he had no intention of leaving his wife for her. Jurors heard that Mr Caan, who was elected in 2012, had gone to the Britannia Hotel in Coventry city centre with her three times in the weeks before her death. After one visit, Ms Parveen text her lover saying: 'One hour isn’t enough - it’s just the frustration'. Mr Caan replied: 'Babes - it’s better than nothing'. The court heard they had exchanged numerous other messages in the weeks before her death and had arranged to meet on April 30 - the day after she was killed. Before her death Ms Parveen had searched the internet for 'mistress', as well as the UK Border Agency and a news article in which David Cameron called for illegal immigrants to be reported to the authorities. The victim’s father also told the court Iqbal behaved like a 'pyscho' in the weeks before his daughter’s death. Tariq Bashir said: 'She told me he was getting angry about silly things. 'He was throwing things around at night. She was feeling very worried and nervous. 'She called him a psycho. She did come to stay with me for about a week in March. 'He was pushing her for the register office date. It was the next step maybe to get to stay here. 'She said he was throwing things around and being very violent. 'She was scared. I said that if he ever hurts you the police station is just opposite.' After sentencing her family paid tribute to a 'beautiful' daughter. They said: 'Salma was the spark of our family and full of ambitions and dreams waiting to come true. 'Her life has not only been taken away from her, our lifestyle, spark and bonding of the family has also gone with her. 'Salma was the person we could trust with our eyes closed, the person who was always there for us, the person who we all looked up to. 'She was so beautiful and so was her heart. She was full of energy and up for any challenge regardless of how difficult it was.'","Muhammed Hussain Iqbal, 29, killed Salma Parveen, 22, in their bedroom .

"By . James  Nye . Carol the elephant has been welcomed back to Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Mississippi after her mysterious drive-by shooting this time last year. The 40-year-old circus favorite will take to the stage in Tupelo on Thursday night after rehabilitation from being shot in the shoulder in the early hours of April 9 while in her enclosure. No one has ever been arrested for the attack despite a $34,000 reward - the only lead being grainy surveillance footage showing a white SUV speeding away from the scene at 2am. Scroll Down for Video . Return: Carol the elephant was shot last year in April while in Tupelo, Mississippi in a shocking crime that has never been solved . 'She's back with a vengeance,' trainer Kathy Carden said. 'She's awesome.' Tupelo Police Lt. Jerry Davis said he’s frustrated, but will not give up hope of making an arrest. 'The case is still being investigated,' he told NBC News. 'Detectives are still working on it; we just do not have any new information to follow up on at this time.' The Mayor of Tupelo, Jason Shelton, said the attack was cruel and he is annoyed they have not caught the culprits. 'It was quite frankly an embarrassing moment for the city, but hopefully those days are behind us,' said Shelton. The shooting led to improved security for the animals of the circus in their fenced-in parking lot home. Elephant and trainer: Kathy Carden said that Carol is ready for her return and has not been affected by the shooting . Wound: This is where Carol was shot - just behind the neck in the shoulder . All healed: There are still bullet fragments in Carol's wound which means that police have not been able to do a full ballistics analysis of the shooting . And for the past year, trucks have been parked in a ring around the animals to add to their protection. And for this week, Tupelo Police said that they will increase their patrols around the animals while the Barnum & Bailey's show is in town. Kathy Carden said that Carol is not nervous about returning to action. 'I’m excited to get there and see everybody and show everybody in Tupelo that Carol is great,' she said. Headlights: The only evidence that police have to go on is this surveillance footage which shows two faint car lights of a white SUV . Friends: Cathy and Carol stare into each others eyes - happy to be reunited on the stage for Thursdays circus . Head over heels happy: Carol happily performs - ready for her return to Tupelo tonight in Mississippi . Cathy said that despite their reputation, she believes that Carol doesn't fully comprehend what happened to her. 'She doesn’t understand that somebody tried to maliciously hurt her; she doesn’t understand that. She just had a little boo-boo; we fixed it right away,' said Carden. However, Cathy says she has not forgotten. 'They intentionally tried to harm Carol, kill Carol, but they could have killed anyone of us. We were all in R.Vs. We were parked in my R.V. with my family, my two little boys and my husband.'","Carol the elephant was shot on April 9 while in Tupelo, Mississippi for the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus .

"By . Chris Paine . Robert Bastin's defence lawyer said the jobless labourer spotted the old-time bike and thought it 'looked like a good idea' A 20 year-old-man has avoided jail for stealing a penny-farthing on Christmas Day and riding it home – 14 miles away. Tipsy Robert Bastin nicked the old-fashioned bike from the garden of a house in Honiton, east Devon, and pedalled all the way back to Exeter where he was living at the time. A court heard he had enjoyed a Christmas drink with his brother when he realised he could not get home on and was stranded. After making it home, Bastin then decided to sell the £350 penny farthing on eBay - but it was the police who 'bought' it as they investigated the theft of the old-fashioned bike. Defence lawyer Peter Woodley told Exeter magistrates court: 'He was trying to get home. 'He had had a Christmas Day drink with his brother and it looked like a good idea. But a penny-farthing is not the easiest thing to return to its owner. 'He was in drink. He saw the back wheel sticking out of a bush, bizarrely not the larger front wheel. He pedalled it to Exeter. At that time of year, Christmas night, no one noticed. It was quite Dickensian. 'Stupidly he tried to sell it.' Jobless Bastin put it on eBay two weeks later and it was the police who 'secured' it for £75 and returned it to its owner, Dale Trott. He accepted the bid and insisted on cash . and the 'buyer' collected it from his home. He was nabbed and the bike . returned to Mr Trott. Bastin pedalled the penny-farthing all the way home - 14 miles to Exeter - and found it when he spotted the BACK wheel sticking out of the bush in the garden of a house in Honiton . Bastin did not say whether he rode the penny farthing along the main A30 dual carriageway between Honiton and Exeter. But he was also in trouble for taking a motor bike along the same road and going through a red light and No Entry sign as police tried to stop him. Bastin, of Honiton, Devon, admitted stealing the old bike which he did while on bail for other offences. He also admitted to aggravated vehicle taking on December 6. Exeter Magistrates Court heard that Bastin was riding a much more powerful Kawasaki motor bike at 5am on the A30 near Exeter airport at speed - 68mph in a 50mph zone. Prosecutor Philip Sewell said police saw his and he was riding in an 'erratic manner and was wobbling'. Bastin did not say whether he rode the penny-farthing along the main A30 dual carriageway between Honiton and Exeter . Bastin was answering other charges at Exeter Magistrates Court, including aggravated vehicle taking on a speeding motor bike . The penny farthing was one of the first ever bikes manufactured when it was introduced in 1870. The bicycle received its name due to its distinctive wheels which resembled Victorian penny and farthing coins. It was invented by James Starley and was unusual because the pedals were fixed directly to the front wheel. The . penny farthing had solid rubber wheels and a very high centre of . gravity - making it very unstable and difficult to ride. It also did not . have brakes or suspension. Production eventually ceased in 1878. A . new version of the historic bicycle was developed by Hawks Cycles in . 2004. It features steel caliper brakes and a modern steel alloy frame . costing £150. Police did not pursue him because they felt it would be unsafe to do so, but he was trapped when police found his clothes and DNA from his motor cycle helmet that he wore. Mr Woodley said the aggravated vehicle taking offence happened at 5am when the main road was 'relatively clear' but said it was not the 'worst case of excessive speed' or dangerous driving. The solicitor said: 'He went out for a drive and used the bike. 'He wasn't familiar with it and wobbled a couple of times. 'He rode through a red light and a No Entry sign at excessive speed – but it was a quiet time of day.' He said the jobless labourer was not coping with life over Christmas after losing his job and splitting up from his partner and young child. 'He had no money and was not thinking straight,' said Mr Woodley, who added that Bastin was stressed and 'acted impulsively and stupidly'. The JPs gave him an 18-month community order with supervision and thinking skills programme. He was banned from the roads for 18 months, ordered to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work and told to pay £75 to compensate the police for the penny-farthing. On another charge of aggravated vehicle taking, the court heard Bastin was riding a powerful Kawasaki motor bike at 5am on the A30 near Exeter airport at speed - 68mph in a 50mph zone .","Robert Bastin stole old bike to get home after drinking with his brother .

Defence lawyer claims it was harmless and 'quite Dickensian'"
"By . Associated Press . and James Rush . The U.S. has delayed an intercontinental ballistic missile test planned for next week amid mounting tensions with North Korea, a senior defense official has said. The official told Associated Press that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel decided to put off the long-planned Minuteman 3 test, due to take place at an Air Force base in California, until sometime next month because of concerns the launch could be misinterpreted and exacerbate the Korean crisis. The test was not connected to the ongoing annual military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea in the region which have angered North Korea.

Work: North Korean soldiers work beside their military fences near the demilitarized zone separating the North from South Korea, in this picture taken from an observation post of the South . Patrol: South Korean soldiers patrol along the military fences near the demilitarized zone . Hagel made the decision Friday, the official said yesterday. Meanwhile, South Korea's top military officer has put off a visit to Washington because of escalating tensions with North Korea that have also compelled more than a dozen South Korean companies to halt operations at a joint factory complex in the North, officials have said today. The tensions in the region have led South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Jung Seung-jo to cancel his plan to meet with U.S. counterpart, General Martin Dempsey, in Washington on April 16 for regular talks. The allies have agreed to reschedule the meeting because Jung couldn't be away from South Korea for several days at a time when North Korea is intensifying its rhetoric, said a South Korean Joint Chiefs spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing office policy. And with pressure growing on Beijing to get North Korea to step back from its war-like footing, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Sunday that no one country should be allowed to upset world peace and added China would work to reduce tensions over regional hotspots. In a speech to a regional business forum with political leaders from Australia to Zaire present, Xi did not offer any concrete plans for how to deal with China's neighbor, North Korea, which has elevated regional tensions through war-like rhetoric and missile deployments in recent weeks.

The state has repeatedly threatened to attack the U.S. and South Korea .

It isn't clear whether Xi was taking a . swipe at North Korea or at the United States, a frequent target of . Chinese criticism, when he criticized unilateral acts that threaten . stability. 'The international community should . advocate the vision of comprehensive security and co-operative security, . so as to turn the global village into a big stage for common development . rather than an arena where gladiators fight each other. Speech: Chinese President Xi Jinping (pictured last month) has said no one country should be allowed to upset world peace and added China would work to reduce tensions over regional hotspots . 'And no one should be allowed to . throw the region, or even the whole world, into chaos for selfish . gains,' Xi said at the Boao Forum for Asia, a China-sponsored talk shop . for the global elite. The North's military warned this week . that it was authorized to attack the U.S. using 'smaller, lighter and . diversified' nuclear weapons. South . Korean officials say North Korea has moved at least one missile with . 'considerable range' to its east coast - possibly the untested Musudan . missile, believed to have a range of 1,800 miles. U.S. officials have said the move . suggests a North Korean launch could be imminent. But while Washington . is taking the North Korean threats seriously, U.S. leaders say they have . seen no visible signs that the North is preparing for a large-scale . attack. North Korea . held its latest nuclear test in February, and in December it launched a . long-range rocket that potentially could hit the continental U.S. Increasing tensions is the uncertainty around the intentions of the . country's new young leader, Kim Jong Un. North . Korea has been angered by increasing sanctions and the U.S.-South . Korean military exercises, which have included a broad show of force . ranging from stealthy B-2 bombers and F-22 fighters to a wide array of . ballistic missile defense-capable warships. The exercises are scheduled . to continue through the end of the month. This week, the U.S. said two of the . Navy's missile-defense ships were moved closer to the Korean peninsula, . and a land-based system is being deployed to the Pacific territory of . Guam later this month. The Pentagon last month announced longer-term . plans to strengthen its U.S.-based missile defenses. The defense official, who was not . authorized to speak publicly about the Minuteman 3 test delay and . requested anonymity, said U.S. policy continues to support the building . and testing of its nuclear deterrent capabilities. The official said the . launch was not put off because of any technical problems. The globe-circling intercontinental . ballistic missiles make up one of the three legs of America's nuclear . arsenal. About 450 Minuteman 3 missiles are based in underground silos . in the U.S. The other two legs of the nuclear arsenal are . submarine-launched ballistic missiles and weapons launched from big . bombers, such as the B-52 and the stealthy B-2. The traditional rationale for the 'nuclear triad' of weaponry is that it is essential to surviving any nuclear exchange.","Fears the long-planned Minuteman 3 test could be misinterpreted .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Karl Warburton, 38, was given a 12-month jail sentenced suspended for two years and banned from driving for 18 months after speeding down a dual carriageway at 130mph . A father-to-be lead police on a 130mph chase on his motorbike before giving officers the slip. Karl Warburton, 38, was spotted by an officer in an unmarked car speeding down the A56 near Ramsbottom, Lancs., on June 30 last year. When the officer turned on his blue lights, instead of stopping, Warburton took off at 130mph, weaving in and out of traffic and even driving down the central reservation in an attempt to escape. Eventually he lost the police by driving the wrong way up a slip road, but was later tracked down using his licence plate and brought to court where he pleaded guilty to dangerous driving. Sentencing him to 12 months in jail, suspended for two years, at Burnley Crown Court, Judge Beverley Lunt said it was incredible Warburton had not caused a serious accident. She said: 'You were not just putting yourself at risk, you were putting others at risk. That is unforgivable.' The court heard that the builder, who runs his own business, had got ‘lost in the moment’ then panicked when he spotted the police. He has since sold his motorbike. Judge Lunt also disqualified Warburton, from Whitefield, Greater Manchester, from driving for 18 months and ordered him to pay £250 costs. She said: 'You are a 38-year-old, allegedly, grown man. A responsible grown man with responsibilities, a family and a business you started up yourself. Warburton was caught speeding along the A56. He drove along a section the central reservation without barriers to overtake cars in the outside lane before driving the wrong way up a slip road. Officers lost him, but later tracked him down using his licence plate . 'Your speeds were terrifying, your undertaking and overtaking was terrifying. The people in the other cars must have absolutely shocked.' After the case one traffic officer said: 'His behaviour was absolutely outrageous. You are surrendering your vehicle to the laws of physics. It was dangerous beyond words.'","Karl Warburton, 38, caught speeding near Ramsbottom, Lancs., last year .

"By . Andrew Chesterton . A powerful horse tranquilliser that doubles as a dangerous and illegal party drug was so successful as a treatment for depression that it helped a 32-year-old woman leave the house by herself of the first time in over a decade. The woman, who chose to remain anonymous, was part of a controversial study by the Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust in which 28 severely depressed patients were regularly injected with ketamine - a powerful and hallucinogenic party drug that’s usually snorted by its users - in an effort to improve their lives. Patients injected with the veterinary tranquilliser said the treatments left them feeling ‘peculiar’, saying the injections made ‘things sound and look different’ and left them with ‘a distorted sense of time’. Tranquilliser turned party drug ketamine helped a severely depressed woman (not pictured in this file photo) leave her house alone for the first time in 10 years . A controversial UK study has found regular injections of the party drug may help treat severe depression . The mother of one patient said the injections left her daughter - who'd suffered from crippling depression for most of her adult life, leaving her unable to leave the house by herself - feeling 'chatty' and able to 'concentrate better'. 'After she’s had the treatment, she’s already feeling better before we leave the hospital,' she told the BBC's Radio 4. 'It works that quickly, and she’s sort of got a lot more confidence in herself when she’s had the treatment.' Rupert McShane (left) says the drug ketamine (right) can improve the lives of those with chronic depression . Her mum said one treatment was so successful that her daughter went for a walk outside the house by herself for the first time in over a decade. 'She’s chatty and she’ll talk to people. She’s not as withdrawn as she’d normally be,' she said. 'She can concentrate better, and after one lot of the treatment she even . went out for a walk on her own the day after - which she’s not done...in the last 10 years.' Ketamine: A powerful horse tranquilliser once used to anaesthetise humans but was largely abandoned due the hallucinations it causes. The illegal party drug is now being used as a treatment for depression. Ecstasy: The drug, which produces hallucinations and euphoric feelings, is already being trialled as a treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder but could also be used by cancer patients. Magic Mushrooms: These naturally occurring hallucinogens could be used in psychotherapy to treat obsessive compulsive disorders or depression. Cocaine: The leaves of the plant that form the base for the party drug has long been used in its raw form as a topical anaesthetic and numbing agent for injuries or operations among South American tribes. The NHS-funded study's head . researcher, Rupert McShane, said patients were given either three or six ketamine injection over three weeks. Of the study’s 28 . participants, 29 per cent reported a positive benefit that lasted between . four and seven days, while 15 per cent reported feeling better for at . least a month. He said that for some patients, the effects lasted for up to nine months. Mr McShane said the challenge now is to find a way to regulate and extend the effects of the drug. ‘That’s the thing that will be interesting in the future, how could we extend the benefit,’ he said. ‘During . the 40 minute infusion of people having a low dose of this they feel . pretty peculiar and things sound and look different and they have a . distorted sense of time. ‘Occasionally . people feel anxious during the infusion, and we also had one person who . had a nasty faint as well. But those kinds of side effects stop pretty . much as soon as the infusion stops. ‘(The . effects) are very variable, some people it may only be six hours but . for others – we had one patient who seemed to get a benefit that lasted . nine months. In the majority though it’s about two weeks. 'It looks as if (the drug) is safe enough when used in a controlled setting.' Research into ketamine as a treatment . for depression was launched in America over a decade ago, after doctors . found that the party drug blocked receptors in the same part of the . brain thought to be responsible for depression. The results have proven so successful that private clinics - like New York's Ketamine Infusions, which provides patients TV and Wi-Fi while undergoing the hour-long procedure - charge US$525 (£315) per injection. The company's website warns patients might experience 'minor visual hallucinations' while undergoing the treatment.","Ketamine is a powerful horse tranquilliser that's also snorted as an illegal hallucinogenic party drug .

"By . Rachel Rickard Straus . Created: . 03:02 EST, 21 November 2012 . Brazen raiders in high-visibility jackets made off with treasured watches worth £210,000 from a collector’s home in Kent. They tied up and gagged a cleaner, then ripped out a safe that had been bolted to the ground.Homeowner Steve Sulley, 26, said he was sickened by the attack at his home. He has released CCTV pictures in a bid to find the culprits. He said: ‘The cleaner wasn’t attacked in the sense of cuts and bruises but she was pinned against the wall and had tape around her mouth. Brazen: Two of the robbers can be seen approaching the door to the house wearing high-vis jackets . ‘She was very shaken up and does not even want to answer the door after what has happened.’ The robbers took nine watches valued at £210,000, plus other items of jewellery, cash and credit cards totalling another £40,000. They burst into the property and pushed the terrified woman to the floor before ransacking the house. They pulled pictures off the walls, went through drawers and tried to destroy the hard disk of a computer, which they believed was linked to home CCTV cameras. Captured on CCTV: The pair approach the house before they attempt to gain entry - the empty van can be seen parked in the front of the driveway . Attempt to gain entry: The two men in high-vis jackets can be seen talking to a third person, believed to be the cleaner . Finding the safe was bolted to the ground they tore it out before carrying it away in what is believed to be a large silver van. Mr Sulley rushed back from Christmas shopping on Regent Street when one of his neighbours phoned him to tell him what had happened. He said: ‘It was shocking. The neighbour said ""your cleaner has been tied up and three guys have gone through your house"". I started feeling sick and nearly threw up.’ His cleaner was taken to the police station where she gave a statement about the robbery. Approach: A third person can be seen approaching the house - the empty van which is thought to have been used to take the stolen goods can be seen in the background . Robbery in broad daylight: Unlike the first two, the third man is not wearing a high-vis jacket as he approaches the front door alone . Uninvited: The third person also attempts to open the door to Mr Sulley's home while the watch collector is out Christmas shopping . It is believed whoever targeted Mr Sulley's house on November 10 might have known about his love of watches. The company director said: ‘I have a passion for watches and I have a good collection. ‘People know I’m fairly successful at what I do and I have nice watches and a couple of nice cars.’ CCTV images from Mr Sulley’s home have been released in an attempt to try and track down the robbers.","Robbers tied up and gagged a cleaner and then ransacked the home in Orpington, Bromley .

"By . Dan Bloom . Police have launched a bigamy investigation over claims a married businessman had a second family living in Thailand. Peter Leonard, 54, vigorously denied the claims as Facebook photos emerged of him with a woman calling herself Jaija Leonard. The businessman, who shares a £400,000 home in rural Bedfordshire with Fiona Leonard, 49, told The Sun he was not married in Thailand and said it was a case of 'a businessman with a girlfriend and baby, pure and simple.' Photos: Pictures on the Facebook profile of a woman calling herself Jaija Leonard showed her with businessman Peter Leonard, who told The Sun he vigorously denied 'vicious' claims of bigamy . He told the newspaper: 'I've been assisting police with their enquiries in order to quash these vicious, vile and untrue rumours that I am a bigamist, which I am not. I'm not married in Thailand.' When asked how his English wife felt about the situation, he said 'as long as she's looked after, I don't think she cares', The Sun reported. 'English wife': Fiona Leonard pictured on the doorstep of her home in rural Bedfordshire . A Bedfordshire Police spokesman said: 'A complaint has been received of bigamy. 'One person came into the police station voluntarily. They have not been arrested at this stage and enquiries are ongoing.' Mr Leonard reportedly met his wife while working at a country club, but started dating former air stewardess Jaija seven years ago and had a daughter with her. Photos on the Facebook profile of . Jaija, believed to be in her 20s, include shots of her walking on the . beach and blowing out candles on a cake with a young girl. Meanwhile Mr Leonard and Fiona - who he reportedly married in 1984 - bought their detached home in a rural Bedfordshire village last July, according to Land Registry records. A man who answered the door yesterday said no one was available to comment. Having more than one husband or wife is illegal in the UK, but prosecutions are rare. Between 1998 and 2009, police in England and Wales investigated almost 1,000 bigamy cases but just 200 people were convicted by the courts. Last week a couple who met online were spared jail for bigamy - after both of them failed to reveal they were already married.

But the marriage fell apart when Baker found documents referring to her new husband's previous life. Baker, of Brandon, County Durham, said she had been divorced as far as she was concerned but not received the right paperwork. She and Bradley, from Gateshead, pleaded guilty to bigamy and perjury.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Created: . 02:38 EST, 1 April 2014 . Joanne Oliver died of swine flu in January 2011, six weeks after she was diagnosed with a chest infection . A bride-to-be died from swine flu less than six weeks after an out-of-hours GP prescribed antibiotics, diagnosing her with a routine chest infection, an inquest has heard. Joanne Oliver, 31, rang the out-of-hours service for medical advice after complaining of a severe cough, aches and pains and bouts of sickness. The mother-of-one's condition was initially treated as urgent. But she was downgraded to routine after a 16-minute face-to-face consultation with a doctor in Oldham, Greater Manchester. Miss Oliver, who was asthmatic, was prescribed the antibiotic amoxicillin, and other medication to control her temperature and was sent to a pharmacy. Six days after her consultation the shop assistant's condition deteriorated 'drastically' and she was admitted to A&E at the Royal Oldham Hospital, struggling to breathe. Miss Oliver was assessed and rushed to intensive care. Initially doctors believed the 31-year-old was suffering pneumonia. But Miss Oliver was later found to have the H1N1 strain of swine flu and was transferred 140 miles away for specialist treatment at Newcastle's Freeman hospital. She spent three weeks fighting for her life, before being airlifted back to Manchester. She passed away shortly after being admitted at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. An inquest into her death heard the GP who treated Miss Oliver did not suspect she had swine flu because doctors had been given no direction to screen patients for a possible strain of the illness. Five months prior to Miss Oliver's death on January, 17 2011, the World Health Organisation declared the notorious 2009 swine flu pandemic officially over. But a week after her death, GPs were ordered to screen for the disease once more. The Manchester hearing was told the tragedy occurred after Miss Oliver, from Oldham, complaining of feeling unwell. She rang the Go To Doc service and was questioned by a trained call handler before speaking to a nurse. She then had a 16-minute consultation as part of the three-stage service with Dr Susan Nelson at the medical centre on December 7, 2010. The mother-of-one called the out-of-hours GP service in Oldham in December 2010, complaining of a severe cough, aches and pains and bouts of sickness . Four months before Miss Oliver complained of feeling unwell, the World Health Organisation declared the 2009 swine flu pandemic over . Giving evidence at the hearing Dr Nelson said 'Her symptoms included aching all over, back pain and vomiting. She had a slight ear ache, sharp pains and pains in muscles and she said the coughing hurt. 'I listened for any sounds on the chest and I listened to the heart as some conditions target it. There was air entry on both sets of lungs. 'She did not have a wheeze but signs of a chest infection. There were no signs of shallow breathing and there was no indication she had major breathing difficulty. I diagnosed her with Lower Respiratory Tract Infection. 'I believed she had a chest infection. This was the same diagnosis given by the doctor she spoke to over the phone.' Dr Nelson prescribed amoxicillin and a painkiller to help her temperature and advised to see her GP within 48 hours if her condition failed to improve. The hearing was told patients visiting the Go to Do service are diagnosed as ‘urgent’ and ‘routine’ cases. Miss Oliver's case had been triaged as 'urgent' after she spoke to a call handler and nurse, before being seen by a doctor. After her consultation Dr Nelson downgraded her condition to 'routine'. The hearing heard patients suffering asthma are considered to be in an 'at risk' group, who can be prescribed anti-flu medication Tamiflu, by GPs outside of a designated flu epidemic. When questioned by Assistant Coroner Robert Chapman, as to whether Miss Oliver should have been treated as an 'at risk' patient, Dr Nelson said: 'In terms of a chest infection, no. 'There was a question of an asthma diagnosis but I did not feel she was an acute asthmatic.' Mr Chapman asked Dr Nelson: 'One of the main issues is the emphasis made to Joanne about how important her state of health was at the time. Did you think she had got Swine Flu?” Dr Nelson replied: 'No. It was before we were directed as GPs to look for swine flu, which was a week later.' Earlier Miss Oliver’s stepmother Patricia Oliver, 75, told the Manchester hearing: 'Joanne used to walk everywhere, she was quite fit but she was a bit down at the time. The 31-year-old was seen by an out-of-hours GP, who prescribed her antibiotics and downgraded the her condition from urgent to routine. She died six weeks later at the Manchester Royal Infirmary hospital . Swine flu is a relatively new strain of influenza that was responsible for a flu pandemic from 2009 to 2010. It is also known as the H1N1 influenza, denoting the strain of the virus. On August 10, 2010, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared that the swine flu pandemic was officially over. Swine flu was one of the main viruses prevalent in recent winters and as a result it was included in the 2012-13 seasonal flu vaccine. People suffering swine flu typically complain of a fever or high temperature - over 38C. Other symptoms include aching muscles, sore throat or a dry cough - symptoms that are very similar to other types of seasonal flu. For those in high-risk groups experts advise getting vaccinated against swine flu. Those considered 'at risk' are pregnant women, people suffering chronic, long-term lung, heart, kidney or liver disease, people suffering conditions including cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's and diabetes. People aged 65 or over are also considered to be at high risk of catching the strain. Most people diagnosed with swine flu recover within around one week, even without specialist treatment. In 2009 swine flu spread rapidly across the world, promoting health bodies to announce a pandemic. The virus was first detected in Mexico in April 2009, but spread quickly from country to country due to it being a new strain. As a result very few people had a natural resistance to the virus. The 2009 pandemic was not as serious as it was first predicted to be, and relatively few people lost their lives as a result. If you suspect you have swine flu, you should contact your GP in the first instance. For more information visit the NHS Choices website. 'We were just told she had an . infection but we first realised she was very poorly when we got a phone . call from her saying she was going to A&E.' Miss Oliver was admitted into hospital on December 13, where her condition began gradually deteriorating. Her step-mother added: 'When we went there she was in a mask. 'We were told initially that she had got pneumonia but later we were told it was swine flu. 'She was in the intensive care unit at Oldham hospital before being transferred to Freeman’s Hospital in Newcastle. 'At Freeman’s her mum spent time with her. We rang three times a day to make sure she was okay. 'We spoke to the nursing staff on the ward but just her mum went to see her. We were told she had got to the stage where theycould transfer her back to Manchester. 'It was a shock to know she was coming home so soon. There was no discussion about the reason why she was being transferred. We assumed it was because it was quite expensive treatment. 'We went down to see her at around 5pm. We were told she had arrived at 3pm into the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). We saw her at 7.30pm. She was comatose at this point. 'At first a doctor had come to see us while we were waiting to see her and I felt elated. 'He said she would be okay, she would be fine. The information we were given then was very positive. 'We were with her for about 10 to 15 minutes and then we left to go home. 'We got a call when we arrived home that said to come to the hospital. She had died. 'We have had all these reports. They said she was in a critical condition when she left. Why was she transferred when she was in such a critical condition? Why was she not brought back by ambulance, why not come back by road.' Dr Peter Holden, a GP and expert witness, said at the time of Miss Oliver’s illness, no advice was being given by NHS about the issuing of Tamiflu and concluded Dr Nelson 'had done nothing wrong'. He added: 'Dr Nelson would not have been able to give Tamiflu even if she wanted. Out of hours is a high risk operation.' Coroner Mr Chapman said: 'I am not concerned over the examination of Joanne.' The inquest continues.","Joanne Oliver died in January 2011, six weeks after seeing a GP .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Whales at SeaWorld have been put on psychoactive drugs akin to Valium, documents have revealed. Orcas, or killer whales, are dosed with benzodiazepine to control their aggressive behaviour, it has emerged in a bitter court case between the marine park and its rival Marineland. The drug, which contains Valium and Xanax, is designed to quell anxiety and commonly causes users to become drowsy. Prolonged use has been proven to cause panic attacks, out-of-body experiences, and muscle spasms. Scandal: Court documents in a bitter dispute between SeaWorld and rival Marineland reveal the scandal-hit park's animals have been dosed on benzodiazepine, a psychiatric drug used to control erratic behaviour . It is the latest scandal to emerge from the marine park in Florida, which suffered a widespread year-long boycott in 2013 after a chilling documentary on the way they treat their whales. Animal rights activists have branded the latest incident the 'final straw'. PETA told MailOnline 'the end is near' for SeaWorld. In a statement, the animal rights organisation said: 'SeaWorld is in deep trouble and hot water since Blackfish showed the mental anguish of orcas taken from the great oceans and trapped for eternity in SeaWorld's swimming pools â€“ and now court documents have revealed that SeaWorld also pumps these marine slaves full of psychotropic drugs in order to force them to perform stupid tricks. 'If SeaWorld executives were locked up within our prison system, they would experience luxurious accommodation in comparison to those of the highly social, intelligent marine animals they imprison, which cause them to lash out, chew their own teeth to the nubs and attack their trainers. The revelations follow a scathing documentary and a book attacking the psychotic trauma SeaWorld's whales are driven to in captivity. Both address the whale Tilikum, which killed trainer Dawn Brancheau . The drug is a sedative used to control erratic behaviour, known for giving prolonged users psychotic reactions . 'SeaWorld can dress the issue up however it likes, but when investors want out, it's a sign that the end is near.' The details of the scandal emerged last night in a legal battle between SeaWorld and Marineland over the transport of Ikaika, one of the world's most treasured killer whales. In a sworn statement filed to Ontario . Superior Court of Justice, the scandal-hit park's rival explained the . creature was sedated using the drug. The . allegations were confirmed by former SeaWorld vice president, now . president and CEO of Pacific Research Laboratories Inc, Dr Lanny Cornell . in a statement to the court. Benzodiazepines affect the way chemicals transmit messages to certain brain cells. They decrease the excitability of many cells, which has a calming effect. When benzodiazepines were first used in the 1960s they were thought to be safe. In 1981, benzodiazepines were the most commonly prescribed medicines in western countries, used by many as a calming aid or sleeping pill. However, it is now known that if you take a benzodiazepine for more than 2-4 weeks, you may develop problems such as panic attack, out-of-body experiences, and muscle spasms. Most doctors will now only prescribe benzodiazepines in very specific cases, and only for a short period. Benzodiazepine, normally used to control human behaviour, contains Valium and Xanax. A spokesperson for SeaWorld defended the medication. He said in a statement: 'Benzodiazepines are sometimes used in veterinary medicine for the care and treatment of animals, both domestic and in a zoological setting. 'These medications can be used for sedation for medical procedures, premedication prior to general anesthesia, and for the control of seizures. 'The use of benzodiazepines is regulated, and these medications are only prescribed to animals by a veterinarian. 'Their use for cetacean healthcare, including killer whales, is limited, infrequent, and only as clinically indicated based on the assessment of the attending veterinarian. 'There is no higher priority for SeaWorld than the health and well-being of the animals in its care.' PETAâ€™s president, Ingrid Newkirk, accused SeaWorld of 'pump[ing] these marine slaves full of psychotropic drugs in order to force them to perform stupid tricks.' The park suffered long-term damage after the release of the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which set out to investigate how animals react to life in captivity and became a critical examination of SeaWorld's treatment of whales. For 12 months after the film's January release, the park was hit with cancellations from high-profile performers and school field trips, as well as aggressive animal activist campaigns. In December, the Orlando-based marine park attempted to salvage its reputation by placing full-page adverts in eight of the country's largest newspapers, rationalising their whale practices. Affidavit: Former vice president of SeaWorld Dr Lanny Cornell confirmed the allegations in this sworn statement . It came after the release in 2012 of . Death At SeaWorld, a book accusing the park of removing killer whales' teeth with power drills and needlessly separating them from their young. The scathing account came two-and-a-half years after the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau when performing with the famous whale Tilikum. Author David Kirkby blasted staff for being inadequately trained, and claimed whales kept in captivity suffer immense emotional and psychological trauma. His research revealed that when performing with Tilikum, staff are instructed to masturbate him with a gloved hand, collecting the semen for the park's artificial insemination programme.","Orcas at SeaWorld given benzodiazepine to control aggressive behaviour .

"By . Tara Brady . Footage has emerged which shows the moment a police officer violently shoves a girl over a bench during riots in Arizona. The video footage was captured during a riot by students from the University of Arizona after they lost to Wisconsin in Anaheim, California during the NCAA basketball tournament on Saturday. Fans back home at the college's Tucson campus took to the streets in a disorderly display of disappointment. Force: Footage shows the bench (left) before the officer appears from nowhere to attack the girl (right) Blink and you'll miss it: The officer in riot gear runs at the girl forcing her over the metal bench . The woman's legs can be seen dangling over the bench after she was hit by police (left) and (right) members of the public react angrily to the force used against the young woman . The officer in riot gear appears from nowhere throwing the girl over the metal frame. After tackling the girl to the ground the officer walks away but fails to arrest or restrain her for any offence. The clip has appeared on YouTube and been watched nearly 50,000 times. However, the online community has reacted angrily to the force used by the officer. One commentator wrote: 'If you slow the YouTube down frame by frame you will see she does nothing. The blonde consoling her says they were trying to find a way around the crowd to get to their cars.' Another added: 'She was just standing there, not attacking anyone. The little cop decided to pick on someone smaller than himself to show how big and bad he was, when in reality he looked like some Power Ranger figure.' However, one person said: 'Perhaps... Just perhaps, she should not have walked TOWARDS the riot police. 'Honestly, if you're an officer and see someone coming up behind you and your fellow officers while a riot is taking place, you would be concerned too. 'Now, the officers force may have been much, but what if the girl had not been innocent? He would then be deemed a hero. Don't be too quick to judge.' Meanwhile, another clip filmed on someone's phone during the riot shows a student standing up to police and taking pepper balls to the chest and abdomen when they tried to tackle him to the ground.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 12:07 EST, 12 December 2011 . RBS repeatedly ignored warnings about Sir Fred Goodwin's 'assertive and robust' management style from as early as 2003, the FSA said today. The regulator raised concerns about chief executive dominance during its meetings with the bank's chairman over the following three years. But the FSA was assured that the rest of the board provided an adequate challenge to Sir Fred, nicknamed 'Fred the Shred', who now enjoys a pension worth £342,500 a year. Sir Fred Goodwin, former chief executive of RBS, had boasted of catapulting his bank 'to the top of the premier league' before its failure . The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has committed a 'catalogue' of financial errors for which the taxpayer had to pay £45.5billion to bail it out . The report also highlighted the strained relationship between the FSA and Sir Fred prior to 2005, in particular RBS's reluctance to allow its non-executive directors to meet the FSA on an individual one-to-one basis. It added: 'FSA supervisory records from 2004 suggest that RBS management, and in particular the RBS chief executive, had been resistant to what they saw as unnecessary FSA interference.' The bank stood out among its peers in terms of the regularity and vigour of its pushback against FSA policy initiatives, although the watchdog said its relationship began to improve after a clear-the-air meeting with Sir Fred in October 2004. Highlighting the deficiencies in RBS's management, governance and culture, the FSA said that under Sir Fred's leadership the RBS board failed to consider in sufficient depth the risks involved in its ABN Amro takeover, preferring to concentrate on the scope for cost-cutting and synergies. The bank, under Chief Executive Sir Fred Goodwin (pictured), disastrously paid £50 billion for lender ABN Amro . The report suggests that RBS's successful acquisition and integration of NatWest in 2000, which was overseen by Sir Fred, may have led to over-confidence in the board's thinking on the ABN Amro takeover. Former investment banking boss Johnny Cameron told an FSA team: 'After we bought NatWest, we had lots of surprises, but almost all of them were pleasant. And I think that lulled us into a sense of complacency around that.' While the hostile nature of the takeover meant it could undertake only limited due diligence, the FSA said the 17-strong RBS board failed in its duties over the ABN takeover. It added: 'With so much at stake, there was a critical need for more fundamental probing, questioning and challenge by the board.' The report revealed City watchdogs admitted a catalogue of errors and flaws, including poor management under the former chief executive. The long-awaited report shed light on what went wrong in the run up to the £45.5billion rescue in 2008, which ended with the state owning more than 80 per cent of the bank. The FSA identified six key factors in . the failure of RBS, most significantly its weak capital position and . over-reliance on risky short-term funding in wholesale markets. RBS pursued a series of acquisitions, . including NatWest in 1999 and U.S. bank Charter One in 2004, but it was . Sir Fred’s disastrous £50billion purchase of Dutch lender ABN Amro in . 2007 – the biggest bank takeover in history – that proved a buy too far. March 6, 2000: RBS offer for NatWest is declared 'unconditional' May 4, 2004: Charter One bought for £5.8bn. RBS launches £2.5bn rights issue to fund takeover of U.S. bank . October 10, 2007: RBS declares takeover of ABN 'unconditional', but market value of assets plummet in the credit crunch . April 22, 2008: RBS announces £12bn rights issue to shore up its weak capital base . August 8, 2008: RBS reports pre-tax losses of £691m for the first half of the year, its first loss in 40 years . October 13, 2008: The Government announces plan to take £20bn stake in RBS . January 19 2009: Sir Fred steps down as chief executive and Government increases its stake to 70%. February 26, 2009: RBS reports a loss of £24.1bn for 2008, the biggest in British corporate history . April 11, 2009: An FSA investigations launched into the bank's bailout . In terms of the ABN Amro acquisition, . the FSA said RBS proceeded without appropriate heed to the risks . involved and with due diligence from the Dutch bank that in April 2007 . amounted to 'two lever-arch folders and a CD'. The FSA said the seventh key factor in explaining the bank's demise was the management, led by Sir Fred. It said: 'The multiple poor decisions that RBS made suggest that there . are likely to have been underlying deficiencies in RBS management, . governance and culture which made it prone to make poor decisions.' FSA regulators were unable to monitor . banks as complex as RBS because they lacked the right skills, while . checks at the bank were also flawed. The FSA admitted it was under pressure to adopt the 'light-touch' approach created by Gordon Brown. It added: 'This approach reflected . widely held, but mistaken assumptions about the stability of financial . systems and existed against a backdrop of political pressures for a . 'light touch' regulatory regime.' Today's report includes a recommendation . that banks should gain regulatory approval for significant acquisitions . and asks whether bank directors should be forced to prove their . innocence in the event of a future failure. However, it confirms that the FSA does not intend to pursue any new enforcement action against any of RBS's former directors. FSA chairman Adair Turner said: 'The fact that no individual has been . found legally responsible for the failure begs the question: if action . cannot be taken under existing rules, should not the rules be changed . for the future?' Business Secretary Vince Cable today said he will continue to look into the issue following the report. A police vehicle outside the Edinburgh home of former bank boss Sir Fred which was attacked by vandals in 2009 . Sir Fred Goodwin, with his wife Joyce, receiving his honorary degree from St Andrew's University . Mr Cable, whose department is in charge of bringing disqualification proceedings, has asked his legal team to provide further advice on what course of action is open to him in the light of the review. He has already been given 'underlying evidence' from accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers in February but was advised this was insufficient to proceed. The FSA said it was a different organisation to the one that failed to rein in RBS prior to its rescue. It claimed it is 'a different organisation now' because it now has more resources, better skills and far greater focus on capital, liquidity and asset quality. Its powers of supervision should be further strengthened under plans to split the regulator in two to create the Prudential Regulation Authority to monitor the strength of the banks and the Financial Conduct Authority to look at legal issues.","Financial Services Authority’s 500-page report published today .

"By . Associated Press . and Taylor Auerbach . A Chinese actor who apologised to his pregnant wife online for cheating on her has set a new record on the communist superpower's version of Twitter. Wen Zhang - a popular Chinese film and television star - was recently snapped canoodling with Yao Di, his co-star on the appropriately named TV series Naked Marriage. The images shocked millions due to Zhang's public image as 'a sensitive and happily married family man,' the Associated Press reports. Damning photos: The snaps that forced Zhang to apologise . Oops: Chinese actor Wen Zhang (right) apologised to his pregnant wife Ma Yili (left) after he was caught up close with another woman . Zhang, 29, has been married to fellow actress Ma Yili for six years and took to Weibo - a Chinese social media platform - in an attempt to patch things up. 'I have brought this upon myself. A mistake is a mistake. This has nothing to do with anyone else,' The Hollywood Reporter translates Wen's message as reading. 'Today, I am willing to accept all the consequences. I've let down Ma Yili and our children. My mistake does not deserve to be forgiven, and it will be difficult for me to make amends for all the harm I've caused. But I want to do it. I have to do it. This is what I'll do for the rest of my life.' Zhang's wife is currently pregnant with the couple's second child. Bad boy: Wen Zhang (left) described his actions as 'unforgivable' His heartfelt confession was posted on Monday to his more than 52 million followers along with the admission: 'the children could have had a warm and nice life, but everything was destroyed by me.' By Wednesday, his post had been forwarded more than 1.2 million times and received nearly 1.9 million comments. Many followers expressed anger towards the rising Asian star. His wife later responded, somewhat philosophically, 'Cherish what you have at the moment. Being in love is easy, being married is not.' At one point the topic was trending above the mystery of missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which has gripped the region and the world. Government censorship restricts what can be said on social media in China but Zhan Jiang, a journalism professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University told Associated Press that unlike political news, 'entertainment news isn't restricted or censored by the authorities. Lovers? Wen Zhang (left) with co-star Yao Di who he was snapped canoodling with recently . 'From the authorities' point of view it isn't good if the public cares too much about politics, but entertainment is safe.' Sina Weibo (the official name of the micro-blogging service) said on its site Monday evening that the vast majority of people discussing Zhang's post were educated women and girls aged 24 and under. Wen's 'tweet' broke a record set by pop singer Faye Wong in September when she announced via Sina Weibo that she was getting a divorce. But it is yet to catch up to the now legendary 3.4 million retweets garnered on Twitter after American chat show and Oscars host Ellen DeGeneres posted a 'selfie' of her alongside a bevy of A-list Hollywood stars at this year's Academy Awards ceremony. The photo - which includes Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep and Kevin Spacey - was such a hit it caused Twitter's servers to crash for minutes. It has since inspired myriad parodies across the world. ___ . AP news assistant Fu Ting contributed to this report. Lovers?

"By . Tom Kelly . Some thought they were under attack. Others swore they could hear a freight train hurtling  along the road or a plane about to crash. All were agreed, however, that the mini tornado that stormed through their seaside community was one of the most terrifying things they had ever experienced. Over 60 heart-stopping seconds, a ‘giant grey wall of wind’ tore along streets, uprooting trees, smashing down fences and ripping apart roofs. Scroll down for video . Lucky escape: Resident Tony Servis (left) with one of the uprooted tress yesterday. Right, a toppled wall's brick pillars and its panels . A Havant Council spokesman said the mini-tornado is believed to have caused damage to properties in Blackthorn Road and Ilex Walk although no injuries had been reported . Nearly 100 houses had roofs damaged after high winds and rain hit Hayling Island, near Portsmouth . Annette Blake in her ruined garden which was hit by massive winds. All her garden fences and the five foot brick pillars that supported them came down, alongside considerable damage to her garden shed . A tree was ripped from its bed in Hayling Island. Police and the council are now working to clear up the damage . Boats were tossed about in the air, garden sheds obliterated and beach huts and caravans wrecked. ‘I heard the roof tiles coming down . and hitting the floor and saw a kayak from two doors down come flying . over the fence and land in our pond. It all happened so quickly, and the . next thing you know there is a rainbow. But everything is demolished. ‘The worst thing about it is  that after 17 years we had almost finished the garden. We will have to start again now.’ Tony Servis in his garage - which had the roof blown off completely . By the time it was all over – just before 8am yesterday – 100 homes had been damaged in Hayling Island, near Portsmouth. It came as forecasters warned of heavy rain and unsettled weather across much of the country for the next few weeks. Residents on Hayling said 50mph winds left streets looking like bomb sites strewn with debris from broken fences, damaged cars and fallen walls. Annette Blake, 56, described hearing a ‘terrifying roar’ as the fierce winds rushed in. She said: ‘I was in sheer blind panic and total shock. It was as if someone was throwing fence panels like a Frisbee. Neighbour Debbie Hayman said she thought the island was under attack when she heard an ‘almighty bang’ during the tornado. She said: ‘I thought a plane was crashing on top of us. You just don’t know but I really thought something awful had hit us. ‘This was quite devastating to see it happen in front of our eyes. You panic as the noise is so frightening.’ Her husband, Tony, 61 added: ‘The trees looked like they were literally being torn out of the ground by the force of the wind . ‘A metal pole my wife uses for the washing line was ripped out of the ground and then span around and around the garden like it was in a washing machine, before being dropped to the ground. ‘Then I heard an almighty bang. I went and looked outside and discovered our caravan had been blown over and smashed into a neighbour’s tree. My shed was completely gone and my motorbike was also damaged.’ Debbie Hayman looks out of the ruined window of her caravan which was flipped on to its side by the huge winds . The winds were so strong they demolished the garden wall at Annette Blake's home. She is pictured with her niece Lana Owen . Mr Hayman said he believed the tornado had caused around £6,000 of damage to his belongings.He said: ‘It is lucky it happened so early on a Sunday morning because nobody was up and about.‘It could have been a lot worse if it had happened later in the day.’ Cheryl Hart described the tornado as sounding like ‘a freight train hurtling along the road’. ‘You could actually see it. It’s difficult to describe but it was like a big grey wall of wind.’ Paul Knightley, forecast manager for Meteogroup, said: ‘The conditions were favourable for a tornado. ‘There is an unstable atmosphere, it is fairly warm for this time of year and there is a lot of moisture in the air.’ Storms caused localised flooding across the country. Flash floods brought chaos to Cardiff  following prolonged heavy rainfall and thunderstorms. Many shops were forced to close after water seeped in through doors. The Met Office said the wet weather would continue for the next three or four weeks, with above-average rainfall expected in many parts. The West and North of England were likely to be worst affected.

"By . Taylor Auerbach . Three hoarders who have amassed a jaw-dropping mountain of rubbish at their Bondi home over the past 20 years are now camping on a footpath alongside their festering heap to prevent rubbish collectors from taking it from them. Cyprus-born Mary Bobolas and her daughters Elena and Liana live in squalor amid piles of filthy boxes, food scraps, clothes and junk in what has become an infamous eyesore in one of Australia's most idyllic suburbs. Last month, their local council finally won the right to force the Bobolas to dismantle the pile. But the trio are putting up an almighty fight and were spotted this afternoon alongside their garbage suburbs away from home. Stubborn: A defiant Liana Bobolas sits on point duty in front of her mounds of rubbish in Alexandria . Firetrap: The Bobolas' home in Bondi, Sydney has become a festering mountain of garbage . Furious neighbours described the three hoarders, whose home has turned into a disgusting animal-infested mound of garbage, as 'lepers' as their stubborn stand against council moved beyond 12 hours. 'It's horrible, terrible, very unhealthy,' said one local. The trio's house - which bulges with mounds of rubbish - has become the scene of an ugly legal stoush and has featured regularly in television, magazine and newspaper reports around the country. A 'delicate' cleanup began yesterday but the defiant hoarders were snapped by MailOnline this afternoon side-by-side with their jaw-dropping pile of garbage more than 10km from Bondi. Their neighbours issued a resounding 'stay put!'. Decades of hoarding and bizarre behaviour have turned their single-storey dwelling into a repulsive firetrap and one at the centre of constant attention from local and state governments. Furious neighbours: The house has been at the centre of ugly legal battles for years . Overflowing: The extent of the Bobolas' hoarding can be seen from space . Last month, in a breakthrough of sorts, the NSW Court of Appeal approved Waverly Council's decision to force the Bobolas to dismantle their mountainous insect-infested pile of garbage. Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported a 'good Samaritan' hired a Thrifty rental van for the family in a bid to help them shift the tonnes of rubbish, a move that has been slammed by neighbours. 'Who on earth would do that, Thrifty will never mean the same to me again,' said one longtime local. The offer backfired when the Bobolas began camping in the van and refused to hand back the keys. 'This is a very delicate situation, you couldn't dream it up,' the 62-year-old resident told MailOnline. 'We were told we were getting poor neighbours but what has happened is unbelievable...I've learned to live with it, they didn't ask to be born.' Nauseating: Locals describe the stench as 'sickening' Stay put! Neighbours welcome the Bobolas' absence as they camp alongside their festering heap . A Thrifty staffer had to reposses the vehicle with a spare set of keys and arrived on Monday night to find the van crammed full of the Bobolas' filthy possessions. They were photographed early on Thursday morning camped in front of the Thrifty depot in Alexandria - where the junk was dumped - alongside their familiar piles of decaying cardboard, clothes bags and electrical wiring. Curious neighbour Tina Sarafopoulos, who spotted them in-front of the depot, said the hoarders were not in a chatty mood. 'I stopped with my friend and I asked ""how are you?"" but she didn't say anything. I said ""could I buy some of your things?"" and she didn't answer. 'Eventually she said ""my friend's not here, I can't sell without her"". She wouldn't open the boxes.' Ms Sarafopoulos can see the Bobolas house from her verandah said the ugly mound is a scene of much inexplicable behaviour. 'At 4 o'clock in the morning they push things into the roof,' she told MailOnline. 'The smell is sickening, they're like lepers.' Out of place: The house festers in one of Australia's most sought-after suburbs . Bizarre behaviour: The hoarders have been spotted shoving trash into this hole in their roof . Another neighbour said the Bobolas weren't around during daylight on Tuesday or Wednesday, describing their absence as 'heavenly peace'. It is understood the Bobolas have been spending their days in front of the Thrifty property - roughly 12km from their Bondi abode - after police ordered them to remove their trash from the rental yard and stack it on a nearby footpath. The Bobolas can often be seen wandering the Bondi streets in the early morning hours looking for further items to add to their unenviable treasure trove. Strange pastime: The Bobolas have been in Alexandria for more than 12 hours, refusing to leave their rubbish .

"By . John Hall . These are the touching images of a woman who has formed a remarkable bond with a kangaroo. Julia Heckathorn, 28, from Virginia in the United States, adopted two-year-old Boomeroo from a farm in Texas when she was just 3 weeks old and the pair have been inseparable ever since. Boomeroo - who wears human clothing - lets out an excited squeak every time Mrs Heckathorn walks into a room, and often stretches her arms out for cuddles and follows her around the house.

Close: Boomeroo - who wears human clothing - lets out an excited squeak every time Julia Heckathorn walks into a room. The children's author (left) says her pet kangaroo also often stretches her arms out for cuddles . Friends: Although Boomeroo sleeps in an outdoor barn each night, she spends her days hopping around the house with Larry the cat (left) and staring out of windows (right, with a sugar glider possum on her back) Mrs Heckathorn is a children's author and takes Boomeroo with her whenever she visits a school in the hope of teaching them more about nature. She says Boomeroo loves to wear human clothes and even has her own wardrobe full of tops and dresses that have been specifically purchased from baby stores for her. When she was a joey, Boomeroo slept in the house Mrs Heckathorn shares with her husband Jason. But as she grew too big to spend all her time indoors, the couple built a temperature controlled barn in their garden where Boomeroo can sleep alongside the couple's other animals - an anteater called Noche, four . sugar glider possums, and a cat called Larry. Dressed up: Boomeroo apparently loves to wear human clothes and even has her own wardrobe full of tops and dresses that have been specifically purchased from baby stores for her .

Although Boomeroo sleeps in the barn each night, she spends her days hopping around the house and garden with Larry, staring out the window, and sleeping at Mrs Heckathorn's feet while she writes. 'When Boomeroo was younger I used to carry her around in a bag with me to the supermarket so she could get used to seeing people,' she said. 'To her I'm her mum and she follows me everywhere. When she sees me near she makes this little sound, like an excited chortle, just as kangaroos would do in the wild to locate their mum,' Mrs Heckathorn added. Family: When she was a joey, Boomeroo slept in the house Mrs Heckathorn shares with her husband Jason .

"By . Wills Robinson . Tragedy: Physics student Matthew Satterthwaite was battling with depression . A coroner has urged the sale of helium to be regulated after the son of a top university professor suffocated himself to death with the gas. Physics student Matthew Satterthwaite, 23, had been battling depression after struggling to settle at the prestigious Royal Holloway college of the University of London, . The coroner at the inquest into his death said he would . write to Theresa May, the Home Secretary, urging her to introduce restrictions on the sale of helium so similar deaths would be avoided in the future. While his mother, Professor Diana Mitlin, was away on academic business in Africa, Matthew  placed an order for the gas. He was was found dead in the bedroom of his family’s £250,000 Victorian townhouse in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester. His cousin became worried when he failed to reply to calls, emails and text messages. A note found near Matthew read: 'I can’t take this anymore. It’s been years since I instigated anything.' It also emerged Matthew was identified as being a suicide risk by a psychiatrist whilst living in student accommodation in London, but the details were not transferred back to Manchester where he was referred to a GP. But he dropped out twice and saw a psychiatrist in London before returning to his family home where he began counselling for depression. Despite his illness, he took up driving lessons and learnt Swahili ahead of a trip to Tanzania where he planned to help teach physics to young African students. Tragedy struck in September last year after Matthew’s mother, who is a Professor of Global Urbanism at Manchester University, went on a work expedition to Zambia and South Africa. His family described him as the: 'Kindest and most loving spirit with a wicked sense of humour.' Professor Mitlin, 53, the former . director and chair of the UK charity Homeless International, told the . Manchester hearing: 'He wanted to go to Tanzania with a person who was . teaching physics but he wanted to learn to drive before he went because . he thought it would be less of a burden. 'About . the end of May he started learning to drive and started learning . Swahili. He passed his driving theory in July and had the practical test . booked up for October and he was talking about going to Tanzania after . that. 'But he was . anxious about struggling with depression and not doing very much didn’t . help that. I wanted him to go sooner but he wanted to pass his test.' Abroad: Matthew's mother, Professor Diana Mitlin (right), was away in Africa when he killed himself . She added: 'It’s difficult to say what he was feeling at certain times because I had some sense he was trying to mislead me and he didn’t want me to think he was depressive or suicidal. 'I had no idea he had helium in his room but even if I did I wouldn’t have connected it with a suicide attempt anyway. I’ve never done physics so I wouldn’t know. 'We were going to go to Anglesey for a couple of days so he could practice his driving and he was looking forward to it.' Professor Mitlin said that in hindsight she believes that Matthew was trying out activities 'one last time.' She said: 'He wanted to go to a Thai restaurant we were keen on. Looking back on it he was conscious about wanting to do certain things. 'Now it seems strange that having been identified by his psychiatrist as suicidal to then be started again at the beginning when he got back to Manchester. Family home: He was was found dead in the bedroom of his family's £250,000 Victorian townhouse in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester. 'Why doesn’t one psychiatrist’s office refer him to a similar department? I think if the NHS had referred him to a similar department and he didn’t feel like he was going back to the start I think he would have presented differently.' Detective Sergeant Richard Thompson of Greater Manchester Police said the note Matthew wrote was found in between documents on his desk. He said police weren’t able to ascertain when the note was written or whether it was directly connected to the death. Recording a verdict of suicide Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows said of Matthew: 'He was clearly a very intelligent young boy with a scientist background and it is inevitable he would understand the consequences of what he did. 'If Matthew really had a better understanding of the grief and heartache he would leave behind I am sure he would have thought more than once about this. But he is an adult and he didn’t suffer from any diagnosable mental illness. He has made a choice. 'Losing one’s own child is the greatest burden of grief any one of us will have to manage. I propose to write to the Home Secretary and point out this is another case which involves the use of helium.' Addressing Professor Mitlin’s concerns over the transferral of documents between mental health institutions nationwide, Manchester Coroner Nigel Meadows said: 'This is a big issue because people can’t get the records. 'There is no national database. It doesn’t exist. I can write to the trust and explain this concern which is something I’m going to do.'

"By . Neil Sears . A humiliated Nigella Lawson last night lashed out over her ‘malicious’ treatment in court. As her two former housekeepers were cleared of a £685,000 credit card fraud, she said she had been ‘vilified’ and could not forgive the court process. Miss Lawson described allegations of her drug taking as a ‘ridiculous sideshow’, and said she found her time as a witness deeply disturbing. Last night huge question marks hung over the 53-year-old celebrity cook’s career, after the end of a dramatic trial in which details of her alleged secret drug abuse, disastrous marriage and chaotic lifestyle were laid bare. Scroll down for video . Fury: Nigella Lawson, pictured leaving Isleworth Crown Court after she gave evidence, has lashed out at drugtaking allegations against her which she called a 'ridiculous sideshow' orchestrated by her ex-husband . The jury found Italian sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo not guilty. The pair said they had effectively been permitted to spend money as they wished in return for keeping quiet about Miss Lawson’s use of drugs. Last night Miss Lawson said the trial was part of a campaign by her 70-year-old ex-husband, the multi-millionaire Charles Saatchi to ‘destroy her’ with malicious and false allegations. In an extraordinary statement, she hit out furiously at the judicial system, saying her experience as a witness had made her feel as if she was the one on trial. She said it had been harrowing to see her children ‘subjected to extreme allegations in court without any real protection or representation’, adding: ‘For this I cannot forgive the court process.’ And she again accused her ex-husband of a ‘sustained background campaign deliberately designed to destroy my reputation.’ Maliciously villified: Nigella Lawson's full statement, which attacked the court system and her former husband . Not guilty: The TV cook accused her ex-husband of a campaign 'deliberately designed to destroy my reputation' as former aides Elisabetta Grillo (left) and Francesca Grillo (right) were cleared of a £680,000 credit card fraud . Harrowing: A furious Nigella said after the trial ended her children had been 'subjected to extreme allegations in court without any real protection or representation', adding: 'For this I cannot forgive the court process' Miss Lawson said: ‘Over the three-week trial, the jury was faced with a ridiculous sideshow of false allegations about drug use which made focus on the actual criminal trial impossible. I did my civic duty, only to be maliciously vilified without the right to respond.’ She had never wanted to talk about her traumatic divorce, she said, and remained concerned ‘about a campaign to circulate false allegations carried out over the course of this summer’. Miss Lawson, pictured leaving court, accused her ex-husband Charles Saatchi of 'intimate terrorism' Over two days of humiliating evidence, Miss Lawson was forced to deny she was a drug addict after confessing to having snorted cocaine and smoking cannabis. Her former housekeepers, who admitted lavishing huge sums of money on themselves at her expense, had claimed that drugs were rife in the household, that she had taken cocaine nearly every day and that she had even allowed her children to smoke cannabis. They said Miss Lawson had let them spend what they liked in return for keeping her cocaine addiction and heavy cannabis use a secret from her ‘shouty’ and frightening husband. Miss Lawson categorically denied she was a habitual drug user – but her attempts to play down her drug use and preserve her wholesome image were effectively rejected by the jury’s verdict yesterday. There were cries of ‘C’e un dio’ – ‘There is a God’ – from the two women’s defence lawyers as the verdict was returned. The decision threatens to destroy Miss Lawson’s hopes of becoming a major television star in America. The cook is currently appearing on US TV show The Taste – but the country takes a notoriously tough line on allowing those accused of drugs offences even to cross its borders. And Miss Lawson also faces the prospect of further legal action in the UK. The police yesterday said they had no immediate plans to take action against Miss Lawson over her admitted cocaine and cannabis use and alleged use of cannabis with her children. But in a statement, they said they would not rule out launching a new investigation if fresh evidence emerged. And Mr Saatchi has previously threatened to sue his ex-wife for £500,000, saying it would be her fault if the Grillos escaped jail because she was ‘so off her head on drugs’. Mobbed: Miss Lawson said the allegations of her drugtaking had overshadowed the trial of Italian sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo, pictured surrounded by security as they left Isleworth Crown Court today . The trial at Isleworth Crown Court, which came after the couple reported the Grillo sisters to police in the summer of 2012, exposed the intimate lives of Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi to full public view. Mr Saatchi’s preference for burnt toast, eggs and frappuccinos over his wife’s delicious meals, his alleged shouting and expletive-filled rages, and Miss Lawson’s claim that he grabbed her by the throat out of jealousy simply because she talked of longing for grandchildren were all heard by the court. Miss Lawson also spoke at her relief at finally being free of the ‘brutal’ Mr Saatchi, whom she accused of ‘intimate terrorism.’ The escalating claims led Anthony Metzer QC, defence barrister for Elisabetta Grillo – known as Lisa – to claim the famous couple were abusing the court process to settle scores over their divorce. While the housekeepers eventually walked free from court, they still face potential civil action from Mr Saatchi to recover the money they spent. Many of their designer clothes have been seized to be sold. Their elder sister, Anna Grillo, last night spoke from the family home in Calabria, Italy of her relief that ‘the nightmare is finally over.’ Through sobs, she said: ‘It is thanks to God that people in Britain have finally seen the truth. The girls have never done anything to hurt Nigella and Charles. ‘They cared for their children like they were their own family, always, and this is how they were repaid.’","Question marks hang over the 53-year-old cook's career after dramatic trial .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . On the final day of enrollment this year for medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government website that runs the program went offline. Again. And White House Press Secretary Jay Carney found himself in the awkward position of taking a victory lap – citing enrollment totals of more than 6 million – while last-minute customers were frozen out of the system. Carney appeared rattled at the beginning of his daily press briefing, committing an unforced error that quickly attracted scorn on social media. 'Six out of ten people without insurance can get insurance for $100 a day or less,' he said, instead of citing monthly prices. Scroll down for video . The Obama administration's health care website stumbled on deadline day for new sign-ups. Visitors to HealthCare.gov on Monday morning saw messages that the site was down for maintenance . Oops! White House press secretary Jay Carney was rattled by the Obamacare news on Monday, saying in error that some uninsured Americans could get coverage for '$100 per day' -- instead of '$100 per month' Medical insurance enrollment fairs across the country saw an increase in participation over the weekend and on Monday, putting new levels of strain on the website as volunteers enrolled people on-site . Healthcare.gov was unavailable for six hours in the early hours of Monday, came back online for a half-hour, and then began connected visitors to its 'virtual waiting room,' a program that contacts users when the website has the capacity to serve them. By midday, however, even that stopgap system was offline, leaving new potential enrollees with no options. The website appeared to return to service around 1:45 p.m., but suffered additional glitches as late as 2:10. 'The tech team monitoring Healthcare.gov in real time has identified an issue with users creating new accounts,' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesman Aaron Albright said Monday. 'The application and enrollment tools are unavailable to new users at the moment. The tech team is working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.' While the website was knocked offline, Vice President Joe Biden appeared in a pre-taped video interview on the Rachel Ray Show to encourage even more Americans to go online and enroll. 'I think people are going to be really, really surprised how well this has turned out,' he said. 'Get in the queue, now. Get in the queue. There is still time today.' The White House blamed its online problems on a crush of last-minute customers, including more than 8.7 million Web visitors in the last week and 1.2 million on Saturday alone. Carney reminded reporters in his afternoon briefing that due to a last-minute policy shift unveiled last week, anyone who manages to begin the enrollment process will be permitted to finish it at a later date. He compared the situation to long lines on Election Day, and the generally accepted practice of allowing people to vote if they're in line when the polls close. But the White House's new policy only . requires insurance-seekers who missed Monday's midnight deadline to . check a box and claim that they tried in earnest to enroll in time. Carney . parried a question about how many previously uninsured Americans will . be covered because of Obamacare, and how many of them were newly insured . after Obamacare's strict minimum requirements caused the cancellation . of their previous policies. 'In . some cases it's kinda hard to measure this,' he said, because the . insurance marketplaces's normal 'churn' regularly eliminates some . policies every year anyway. What to do? Americans have struggled with online signups and call centers, leading tens of thousands to flood in-person events staffed by 'navigator' volunteers . People using the healthcare.gov website have encountered tech glitches as everyone entering the system -- including millions of new Medicaid enrollees -- competed for scarce computer resources on the final day . More than six million Americans have chosen health insurance plans on healthcare.gov and websites run by 14 states and the District of Columbia, but the question of how many have actually paid for coverage is a thorny one . He also boasted on Monday that the six-month enrollment total for Obamacare policies will be 'significantly above 6 million,' but declined to say – as he has many times before – how many of those enrollees have actually become insured by paying their premiums. 'We don't have those figures,' he insisted. Estimated compiled by MailOnline from states that report such numbers indicate that as many as one out of five subscribers haven't paid, lowering any White House numbers by 20 percent. That would take a possible 6.5 million enrollment total down to 5.2 million. Republicans are counting on Obamacare's dysfunctions – not just the enrollment roadblocks, but higher costs, limits on care and smaller physician networks – for a political windfall in November. 'We're not really going to know whether [Obamacare] worked or not until the third or fourth year. And of course, that's two elections down the road, Washington and Lee University Law School professor Timothy Jost told Reuters. 'What I worry about is that we won't be able to figure out whether it's worked or not until it's too late.' White House senior adviser David Plouffe said Sunday on the ABC News program 'This Week' that the GOP will fail in its bid to parlay Obamacare's failures into a sweep and a takeover of the U.S. Senate. 'I think the Republican playbook of just repeal Obamacare, repeal Obamacare, repeal Obamacare gets tougher as more and more people get health care,' said Plouffe. 'I think smart Republicans understand that.'","More than six hours of website outages plagued healthcare.gov on the last day for enrollment, harkening back to the system's disastrous October 1 launch .

"By . Alex Ward . A city trader who conned millions of pounds from wealthy investors was yesterday ordered to pay back £1. Nicholas Levene, 48, was jailed for 13 years last November after he admitted orchestrating a lucrative Ponzi scheme which raked in £316million. He used the money to finance his own lavish lifestyle with private jets, super yachts and round-the-world trips. Must pay £1: Jailed city trader Nicholas Levene (pictured arriving at court in November last year), who conned wealthy investors out of £316million, was ordered to pay the nominal sum because he is bankrupt . Now, because he is bankrupt, he has been given seven days to pay back a nominal sum of £1. The Serious Fraud Office found that Levene had conned £32,352,027 from some of Britain’s most successful businessmen. But with interest and lost profits, his clients are believed to be £101,685,406 out of pocket. It is unclear how much, if any of . this, his victims have recouped. Justine  Davidge, representing the SFO, . told Southwark Crown Court yesterday that Levene had been subject to a . bankruptcy order since October 2009 and there were ongoing . investigations into his assets. Jailed: Levene, nicknamed Beano because of his love of the comic (pictured left on the trading floor in 1990, and right with wife Tracy), was jailed for 13 years in November last year . She added that anything seized would . be dealt with by bankruptcy officials. ‘In respect of the realisable . amount, we suggest the court make a nominal order of £1 to be paid in . seven days,’ she said. ‘It may be in the future, Mr Levene could come . into further realisable assets.’ Levene admitted ripping off a series . of high-fliers, including Sir Brian Souter and his sister Ann Gloag, the . founders of the Stagecoach bus and rail group; Richard Caring, owner of . The Ivy and Le Caprice restaurants in the West End; and Russell . Bartlett, director of the R3 Investment Group and former owner of Hull . City Football Club. Nicknamed Beano because of his childhood love of the . comic book, Levene was a successful City worker with an estimated . wealth of £15million to £20million in 2005. High-flyer: Levene conned some of Britain's most successful businessmen while owning this £2million eight-bedroom property in Barnet, North London . Lavish lifestyle: Levene ran a multi-million pound illegal 'Ponzi' fraud scheme which he used to finance private jets (file picture), super yachts, a £150,000-a-year box at Ascot and on hosting £10,000-a-day pheasant shoots . But he was addicted to gambling, spending fortunes on spread betting, and had an insatiable taste  for luxury. Levene, a former deputy chairman of . Leyton Orient Football Club, admitted one count of false accounting, one . of obtaining a money transfer by deception, and 12 of fraud. He would take from Peter to pay Paul . and move the funds between accounts in the financial havens of Jersey, . Switzerland and Israel. Seeing stars: The fraudster spent £588,000 on his second son's Bar Mitzvah celebration, which featured a performance by girl band The Saturdays (file picture) Spent big: His fraud scheme meant he could pay for a £150,000-a-year box at Ascot (file picture) but with interest and potential profits considered, clients are believed to have lost out by £101.6million . Victim: Stagecoach Group's co-founders, brother and sister Sir Brian Souter and Ann Gloag (pictured) lost £10million . With his network of contacts and . strong reputation, he won people’s faith with seemingly concrete . investment deals from which he would take a commission or fee. The married father of three took . millions of investors’ funds, promising to invest the money in lucrative . rights-issue releases from  companies such as HSBC, Lloyds TSB and . mining firms Xstrata and Rio Tinto. But he dug an ever-deepening financial . hole for himself, having to fob off clients and make excuses about why . he could not pay them. Living the high life, he had a chauffeur-driven Bentley and went on several holidays a year, each lasting several weeks. Investigators found evidence of round-the-world trips, yacht hire and top hotel stays in Australia, South Africa and Israel. The fraudster had a fleet of luxury . cars and spent £588,000 on his second son’s Bar Mitzvah celebration, . which featured a performance by girlband The Saturdays. Levene’s main . house was a £2million eight-bedroom property in  Barnet, North London. His gambling was huge, with investigators finding evidence of him blowing £720,000 on a cricket match bet in 2007. Having been told about the seizure of . Levene’s assets, Judge Martin Beddow said: ‘As there is nothing . available, I direct the payable amount will be the nominal amount of £1 . to be paid in seven days.’ Levene did not appear in court for the hearing.","Nicholas Levene must pay the nominal sum because he is bankrupt .

"By . James  Nye . Samsung and David Ortiz appear to have duped President Obama into participating in their latest questionable promotional stunt. The supposedly spontaneous selfie the Red Sox hitter snapped with a smiling Obama on the White House lawn on Tuesday was in fact sponsored by the South Korean tech-giant as part of a new commercial relationship between the two. What had initially seemed a genuine part of the 2013 World Series winner's celebrations was confirmed to be an advertising campaign that brought a curt response from Jay Carney, the White House spokesman and himself a diehard Red Sox fan. Scroll down for video . Selfie and self-promotion: The photograph that David Ortiz took with President Obama on Tuesday was quickly seized upon by Samsung after it was announced that they and Ortiz had signed up to a commercial deal together . Spontaneity? Red Sox Designated Hitter David Ortiz (L) takes a selfie with US President Barack Obama after presenting a jersey during a ceremony on the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 1, 2014 . 'POTUS did not know,' said Carney in an email sent to Bloomberg, confirming that Obama had essentially been tricked into an attempt to boost the social media profile of Samsung and their cellphones. Proving as gleefully off-the-cuff as Ellen DeGeneres' 'Best Selfie Ever' at the Oscars, Samsung confirmed to ABCNews.com that they and the Red Sox player had conspired to snap the photo which was re-tweeted almost 40,000 times through Ortiz's Twitter account. Claiming they were 'thrilled to see the special historic moment David Ortiz captured with his Galaxy Note3', Samsung said that 'Similar to the selfie Ellen was able to capture during the Oscars, this was an opportunity for David to share the incredible moment.' However, Samsung said that a selfie with Obama was not specifically planned, although it would have obviously been top of the list of a White House visit.

'We didnâ€™t know if or what he would be able to capture using his Note 3 device,' the company said Tuesday in a statement, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday. Samsung did admit that prior to the Red Sox anticipated visit to the White House where they presented the president with his own '44' jersey, they 'worked with David and the team on how to share images with fans.' Ortiz grabbed the opportunity for his presidential selfie during the middle of the ceremony photo-op on Tuesday, asking Obama, 'Actually, would you mind if I take my own?' Tellingly, one of his teammates yelled . out, 'cha-ching' - possibly indicating he knew of the deal Ortiz had . signed with Samsung, which was announced on Monday. He quickly posted the picture, writing, 'What an honor! Thanks for the #selfie, @BarackObama.' Team mate selfie: David Ortiz also took the opportunity to snap some pictures of him and his victorious 2013 Red Sox colleagues during their visit to the White House . While the picture didn't come close to Ellen's record of 3.4 million retweets, Samsung US immediately retweeted the picture to its 5 million followers, writing: 'Big Papi, Big Selfie.' Samsung US were quick to tell its followers that the phone the shot was taken with. It retails for up to $700 on Amazon, dependent on the contract. As Twitter users quickly wised up to what was going on, they asked Samsung US's account what had happened. 'This photo was taken with a #GalaxyNote3,' Samsung immediately tweeted.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A homeless man's lucky day was cut short by police after he was able to withdraw over $37,000 from a Maine ATM. Police in Maine are investigating after a malfunctioning ATM at a bank spit out the whopping sum -- though the homeless man originally requested $140. South Portland police were called to a TD bank branch at 1am on Thursday morning when a man was sleeping next to the ATM, WGME-TV reports. Officers moved him along, but he later returned. A malfunctioning ATM at a South Portland TD Bank, seen here, dispensed $37,000 to one lucky homeless man early on Thursday morning . At about 5:30am, police received a call from a woman who said a man was spending an unusual amount of time at the ATM she was waiting to use, the station adds. When officers returned, they saw the same man from before stuffing money from the ATM into a shopping bag. Lieutenant Todd Bernard told the station that police have dealt with the man before, and that he used his bank card to withdraw $140 -- but the ATM kept giving him more money.

The money was returned to the bank, and bank officials said they don't want to press charges. Police continue to investigate the case.

"By . James  Nye . A Manhattan court stenographer with a drinking problem jeopardized the outcome of more than 30 verdicts by repeatedly typing 'I hate my job, I hate my job,' instead of the actual trial dialogue. Officials are rushing to repair the damage caused by Daniel Kochanski, 43, with 10 cases going through the appeals process potentially able to claim that crucial evidence is missing in their conviction. Alcoholic Kochanski's transcripts were an utter mess according to court sources familiar with his case saying, 'It should have been questions and answers - instead it was gibberish'. The New York Post compared Kochanski's antics to the meltdown of Jack Nicholson's unhinged character in 1980s The Shining, who writes 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,' again and again. Repetitive: Daniel Kochanski had some form of breakdown while working as a stenographer in a Manhattan court - brought on by his alcoholism . Kochanski, who was fired in March 2012 for misconduct hit either random keys during court proceedings or 'I hate my job'. The most high profile of Kochanski's botched transcripts is the 2010 mortgage-fraud trial of Aaron Hand - who was also convicted of trying to hire a hit man to take-out a witness who would testify against him. Claudia Trupp, of the Center for Appellate Litigation, said her office was handling the appeals in Hand’s and nine other cases. 'I never had a situation where a single court reporter was responsible for so much damage,' she said. At the time of his sacking, Kochanski was summoned to the Manhattan's DA Office and arrested and forced to make sense of his shorthand mess. Even that failed, and at the courts expense and time, judges have been holding 'reconstruction hearings' in which everyone in the case has to testify what they remember. Gibberish: Kochanski, who was fired in March 2012 for misconduct hit either random keys during court proceedings or 'I hate my job' 'This situation is terrible for everybody,' Trupp said. 'It’s very difficult to come up with a sufficient record based on everybody’s recollection years after the event.' The stenogrpaher's father, Ed Kochanski, told the New York Post that his son was an alcoholic - losing his wife and his job. His wife Heather Kochanski said that, 'The pressure of that job pushed him over the edge, leading him to lose everything.' And on the phone to the New York Post, Kochanski denied messing the transcripts up. 'I never typed gibberish. I always did my job 100 percent. I was let go because of substance abuse,' he said. 'I’m in recovery. July will be one year I’m clean,' he said.","Daniel Kochanski, 43, was fired for typing gibberish or 'I hate my job' repeatedly instead of actual court dialogue .

"By . Tara Brady . A mild-mannered musician has become the world's first professional Kim Jong-un lookalike. Howard, from Hong Kong, has endured endless jokes about his dictator double ever since Kim rose to power in 2011. Now the 35-year-old is perfecting his wave and stern smile to bag work moonlighting as the ruthless general's impersonator. Scroll down for video . Uncanny:  Kim Jong Un lookalike Howard poses for a picture at his desk in Hong Kong . Howard - who refuses to give his surname for fear of reprisals form the secretive state - said: 'The key to becoming Kim is to always look unhappy and dissatisfied. It is his trademark. 'The reaction whenever I step out in the Mao suit, make up and hair slicked back is always crazy. 'Sometimes I have to wear a baseball cap and sunglasses to try and avoid the attention when going about my everyday business.' Howard says he fell into the role almost by accident when a picture of himself posing as the Dear Leader went viral on Facebook last April. Dictator: Kim Jong Un lookalike Howard poses outside the United States embassy in Hong Kong . Power-trip: Kim Jong Un lookalike Howard salutes in front of a crowd in Hong Kong . The reaction prompted him to set up a page on the social networking site advertising his body double services - and received a string of requests and offers. Within weeks he had appeared in a controversial TV ad threatening to nuke America for an Israeli burger chain. Howard, a Hong-Kong born Australian, added: 'It seemed like a good idea at the time to turn professional and I figured I might as well make a buck or two out of my likeness. Double-life: Howard checks his phone while he travels on the metro in Hong Kong . Not so hostile: Kim Jong-Un lookalike Howard shakes hand with a person on the street in Hong Kong . 'He needed a lookalike so I figured I best step up to the task given my likeness.' And thankfully for the 35-year-old it is easy to keep up appearances in between gigs. Howard added: 'Keeping up with Kim's look is extremely easy and enjoyable. All I have to do is eat and eat and then eat some more. 'It is fun to play him because it freaks people out.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron and . George Osborne today celebrated scoring a victory over the International . Monetary Fund as it dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for . Britain. Less than a year . after the IMF warned the coalition was 'playing with fire' by refusing . to abandon its economic plan, today it revealed it now expects growth of . 2.4 per cent in 2014. The . dramatic upgrade from from a previous figure of 1.9 per cent puts . Britain among the fastest-growing of the world's advanced economies. Delight: George Osborne and David Cameron expressed their pleasure at the sharp increase in the IMF forecasts . Vindication: David Cameron took to Twitter to hail the upgrade as proof that the Government's plan is working . The IMF puts the UK's pace of expansion ahead of European rivals including Germany and France. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor will quick to express their delight at the sharp increase in the IMF forecasts. Mr . Cameron wrote on Twitter that it was 'another sign our long term . economic plan is providing jobs & security for hardworking people' and an 'encouraging sign of more jobs and security'. In . the latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF forecasts that growth for . 2013 will have come in at 1.7 per cent and that after recording 2.4 per . cent this year, it will slow to 2.2 per cent in 2015. The IMF report said: ‘Activity in the United Kingdom has been buoyed by easier credit conditions and increased confidence.’ But the report said ‘economic slack’ - spare capacity left in the economy which can be measured by factors such as unemployment - would remain high. However the upgrade is a major boost for the UK government just a day after the respected . Ernst & Young Item Club said it now expects the UK economy to grow . by 2.7 per cent in 2014. A separate report by global research group IHS said Britain will help drive growth around the world this year. ‘Economies . considered dull and old, like the United States, UK, Germany and Japan, . will actually be 2014’s new locomotives of growth,’ said IHS chief . economist Dr Nariman Behravesh. The IMF forecasts that the world economy will grow by 3.7 per cent in 2014, up from 3.6 per cent in its last forecast, though risks remain. The . improved forecasts for the UK will be particularly pleasing for the . Chancellor after he last year clashed with the Fund’s chief economist . Olivier Blanchard over his economic plan. New stance: It comes after IMF's Economic Counsellor and Director of the Research Department, Olivier Blanchard, pictured, accused Osborne of 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with austerity . In April last year the IMF's chief economist  Olivier Blanchard caused a political storm when he called for George Osborne to change course. He warned that with growth stalling, the austerity programme should be dropped. Challenged about why the UK Treasury was persisting with its economic plan, he declared: 'I think that I am right and they are wrong.' But events have proved him to be incorrect. This is what he said last year: . 'I think conditions have deteriorated. There is no question that the fiscal plan - which was designed a few years back - was assuming that private demand would be stronger than it is. 'The danger of having no growth, or very little growth, for a long time is very high; you get a number of vicious cycles which come into play… the result is that [people] don't spend, output is low. 'And I think you're playing with fire when you get to very low growth rates so... if you can decrease the speed of fiscal consolidation maintaining the credibility (so it's not a question of whether, it's a question of when), when growth is close to zero I think yes it's worth considering.' Mr Blanchard accused Mr . Osborne of ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead with austerity but has . since been forced to admit that he has been ‘pleasantly surprised’ by . the strength of the recovery. The IMF put the revival in the UK down to rising confidence and increased lending to households and businesses. It . is feared, however, that the recovery is based on consumer spending and . the housing market rather than business investment and exports. Britain still lags behind the US with the world’s largest economy set to grow by 2.8 per cent this year and 3 per cent in 2015. But the UK will be the strongest economy in Europe and also outpace Japan. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Today's report provides further evidence that the Government's long-term economic plan is working, with the IMF upgrading their 2014 forecast for the UK by more than any other G7 economy. ‘But the job is not yet done and so the Government will go on taking the difficult decisions necessary to deliver a sustainable recovery for all.’ The IMF's previous prediction of 1.9 per cent growth for 2014 last October was an upgrade from an earlier figure of 1.5 per cent. The . ailing French economy, struggling under the policies of Socialist . President Francois Hollande, is expected to grow by 0.9 per cent this . year - less than half the rate of expansion earmarked for Britain. Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'After three damaging years of flatlining, any growth is both welcome and long overdue. 'But this is the slowest recovery for 100 years and working people are facing a cost-of-living crisis with real wages now down £1,600 a year under David Cameron.' He added: 'With business investment still weak and the IMF forecasting that UK growth will slow down again next year, it’s clear that this is not yet a recovery that is built to last. Simply to catch up all the lost ground since 2010 we need 1.5 per cent growth each quarter between now and the election.'","UK to grow faster than any EU country, including Germany and France .

"By . James  Nye . The FBI has appealed for the public's help in tracking down a dangerous child predator caught on video sexually abusing a young boy. The man, known only as John Doe 28, was discovered in a downloaded video in November 2012 by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). The two agencies are so desperate to locate the man and rescue the exploited child that they have released three images of the pedophile to the general public in the hope of generating leads. Scroll down for video . Identification: The FBI want to find this man who has been captured abusing a young boy (barely visible in the blue) on a video found in another pedophiles home  - appealing to the public for their help . 'Subjects who show their faces in child pornography are not typical,' said Special Agent Karen Jurden. 'It is our hope that someone will recognize this individual and come forward. We were able to recover a very clear image of John Doe 28.' Identifying marks: The FBI have asked if people can place this burgundy t-shirt with a fish logo on it . The NCMEC and the FBI's Violent Crimes Against Children program have enhanced screen grabs from the sickening film to help provide any clues that may lead to his identification. Authorities hope details such as the picture hanging on the wall behind the man along with the blue chair in the images may jog someones memory. Also, John Doe 28 wears wire-framed glasses and a burgundy t-shirt with a fish on it that a member of the public might recognize. They have urges anyone who has any information to immediately contact the FBI. Unfortunately, so far, the FBI and NCMEC have not been able to identify the man, or even the state, town or area - but they believe he is American, because he speaks one word during the video, 'careful'. 'Sometimes we will get some type of identifier that narrows down the geographic region,' said Jurden, who has been working on these types of cases for four years, 'but that didn’t happen in this case. That’s why we are asking for the public’s help nationwide.' The two minute video was found during the arrest of a San Francisco man on child pornography charges. 'The video was part of his collection,' Jurden added, explaining that sexually explicit videos and images of children are often traded anonymously online. The rush to find this man ar part of the FBI’s Operation Rescue Me and Endangered Child Alert Program (ECAP) initiatives and represent a longstanding partnership with NCMEC. Since the inception of ECAP in 2004, 28 John Does have been investigated; 20 of these cases have been successfully resolved so far.

"By . David Mccormack . A teacher in a small Canadian town has given thousands of former students good cause to remember him later in life when they unexpectedly receive letters handwritten by themselves 20 years previously. Bruce Farrer, 72, began his career as a high school English teacher in Fort Qu’Appelle, a town of about 2,000 people in Saskatchewan, in 1961. Not long after he came up with the idea of getting his high school freshmen pupils to write a 10-page letters to their future selves, to be read by their eyes only when they reached adulthood. Bruce Farrer, 72, has given thousands of former students good cause to remember him later in life when they unexpectedly receive letters handwritten by themselves 20 years previously . Farrer, who spent much of his career at Bert Fox Community High School, started to exercise simply because he wanted to encourage his students to write. ‘I was trying to think of some assignment that would be special, and it just sort of came up,’ he recently told the National Post. By the time he retired in 2002 Farrer had amassed five bins worth of letters waiting to be returned to their authors. Every year Farrer sets about his task of tracking down his old pupils and this year it was the turn of the class of 1994. DJ Anardi poses with the letter he wrote 20 years ago. Back in high school he had wanted to go to college and play football, but instead he works at a steel mill . Among those who took a trip down memory lane when they opened their mailboxes last week was Scott Fulton, who is now a teacher himself. He remembered doing the assignment, but not what he wrote. ‘It kind of faded from my memory,’ he told CBS News. ‘To receive it again was pretty special.’ ‘So, anyway, are you married?’  his 14-year-old self asked. ‘To who? I've always wondered if I would get married to somebody I already know now or somebody I'll meet later on in my life ... Did you got to university? Which one?’ Fulton doesn’t currently have a wife or kids and decided to become a teacher, rather than do sports medicine, as his teenage self had planned. DJ Anardi has two children with Erin who he had a crush on at school 20 years ago, while Scott Fulton, who opened his 20-year-old letter this week is now a teacher himself . Another former pupil who received his letter this year is DJ Anardi. ‘Hey you good-looking guy, how is your life?’ his 15-year-old self had written. Back in high school Anardi had wanted to go to college and play football, but instead he works at a steel mill. He was dating another girl when he put pen to paper in the early 1990s, but had a crush on a girl named Erin. Today, Erin is his wife and the mother of his two boys. In his letter he’d written that he wanted three or four children. ‘I hope other teachers do it,’ he said. Farrer says not all his ex-students are so happy to receive their letters: ‘I think some of them are embarrassed by how immature they were, but when you’re 14, you’re immature.’ One particular student was obsessed with ABBA and dreamed of marrying a 'beautiful blond Swede' now lives in Sweden with his Swedish wife . ‘And some of them don’t want to show it to their spouses or their parents,’ he said. Some letters have unearthed amazing stories. One particular student was ‘obsessed with ABBA and dreamed of marrying a “beautiful blond Swede,”’ said Farrer. ‘Twenty years later, the young man had moved to Sweden and done just that.’ The retired teacher has spent countless hours tracking down students who’ve long grown up, moved away from home and married. Farrer does his best to use his network of former students, along with social media and good old-fashioned detective work to get the letters back to their authors. Farrer spent much of his career at Bert Fox Community High School in Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan . Sadly some students have passed away before they could read the words they wrote as teens, with suicide, car accidents, and illness claiming their lives. When students originally turned in the letters, they let Farrar know if he was allowed to read them or not. In the case of deceased students he reads them regardless, mostly to decide whether sharing them with their families would be comforting or painful. By and large it’s a happy process for Farrer, and he’s delighted to see how things have worked out for his students.","For more than 40 years Bruce Farrer got his freshman students to write a 10-page letter to their future selves .

"By . James Rush . Televangelist Pat Robertson has compared electronic payments and new technologies which would make cash redundant to the 'Mark of the Beast'. The television preacher warned viewers of CBN how new technologies in electronic payments could be used as a form of 'control'. Citing a passage from the Bible's book of Revelation, the television preacher warned of the 'dark side' of radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies. Scroll down for video . Televangelist Pat Robertson has compared electronic payments and new technologies which would make cash redundant to the 'Mark of the Beast' 'The Bible says that they cannot buy or sell without the Mark of the Beast,' he says. 'And people said, ""Oh, well, that's just fanciful Hebrew rhetoric that doesn’t apply to anybody real."" Who would have thought that we could live in an age that that could literally come to pass?' He later warns the audience of new technologies whereby people will no longer be required to use cash and instead carry a card which can be automatically read upon entering a store. He says: 'I hate to tell you, it's coming. Because it is a control thing. And Satan wants to control the lives of all the world. 'He wants to be God, he wants to be worshipped as God. And he wants to have control over everybody, and that's how it will be done.' He finishes the address with: 'Can't buy, can't sell without the Mark of the Beast.' Robertson warned his audience of new technologies whereby people will no longer be required to use cash and instead carry a card which can be automatically read upon entering a store . A report broadcast as part of the segment also featured Katherine Albrecht, the author of two books about RFID, who said: 'There will be a time when humanity will be forced to take a mark and that mark will be on the right hand or the forehead. It is the number 666.' Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data, for the purposes of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects. RFID tags are used to track animals and are inserted beneath their skin. The anti-theft hard plastic tags attached to merchandise in stores use the technology. RFID tags are used to check baggage in airports and identify trees. They are embedded in credit cards and Oyster transport cards so users can make payments by touching an electronic reader. She goes on to say: 'Some people say . RFID will be the Mark of the Beast because it can be a mark on your hand . that you can transmit. 'If . it isn't, and it may well not be, there may well be something that . comes next beyond that to fulfil that biblical prophecy, but every one . of those steps was getting us closer to that end destination.' Robertson's website allows viewers to buy his book through electronic transaction. Meanwhile viewers are also able to donate to CBN through credit cards, electronic funds transfers and cash, The Raw Story reported. In July last year Robertson told a viewer who wrote into his show about having a haunted house to burn the house down, move or perform an exorcism.

"By . Jonathan O'callaghan . A direct link between brain and tooth size may seem unlikely, but Spanish researchers have revealed some surprising results. Throughout the 2.5 million year history of man and his ancestors, the size of teeth have decreased in size as our brains have become larger. The scientists described the finding as an ‘evolutionary paradox’ and said that it could be due to how our diet has changed. Big bite: Researchers have discovered that primates in the human lineage 2.5 million years ago had smaller brains but bigger teeth than we do today . They also claimed that it is the first time they have seen such a relationship. Humans (Homo sapiens) are primates of the family Hominidae, and are the only species of the Homo that still exist. Humans are characterised by having a large brain relative to body size, with a particularly well developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, making them capable of abstract reasoning, language, introspection, problem solving and culture through social learning. Experts believe Homo sapiens originated in Africa, and fossils show it resembled modern humans about 200,000 years ago, and began to behave like them around 50,000 years ago. It would be expected that as our brains grow in size, we would need to eat more in order to sustain a higher metabolism. But the scientists say that eating more nutritious food, such as animal meat, has enabled us to eat less while still getting the proteins, fats and so on that we need. Larger brains have also enabled the Homo genus to make key innovations including using tools, planting crops and farming that have given us access to better food. ‘Brain volume and cheek-tooth size have traditionally been considered as two traits that show opposite evolutionary trends during the evolution of Homo,’ the scientists, led by Juan Manuel Jiménez-Arenas, write in their research article. ‘Here we show that there is an essential difference between the genus Homo and the living primate species,’ they add.They go on to add Homo is the only primate to show ‘an inverse relationship’ in teeth and brain size. Nice to eat you: Our distant ancestors may have needed larger teeth as their diets were considerably worse . The research was carried out by studying the size of post-canine teeth in a variety of primates. The shrinking of teeth may also be due to the inactivation of a gene called MYH16. This is linked to the structure of the brain, which fell in size about 2.4 million years ago. Both this theory and that of a changing diet might be the solution to this puzzling evolutionary trend that has left scientists stumped. What will become of our teeth in future as we get smarter and smarter remains to be seen.","Researchers found that 2.5 million-year-old ancestors had bigger teeth .

"By . Associated Press . Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich is stepping down as CEO following protests over his support of a gay marriage ban in California. The Mountain View, California-based nonprofit maker of the Firefox browser infuriated many employees and users last week by promoting Eich. At issue was Eich's $1,000 donation in 2008 to the campaign to pass California's Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that outlawed same-sex marriages. The ban was overturned when the U.S. Supreme Court last year left in place a lower-court ruling striking down the ballot measure. The contribution had drawn some negative attention in the past but took on more weight when he was named CEO. Scroll down for video . Prop 8: Mozilla's new CEO, Brendan Eich, supported California's proposed ban on gay marriage . Mozilla employees and users criticized the move online. Dating website OKCupid replaced its usual homepage for users logging in with Firefox, the world's third-most-popular Web browser, with a note suggesting they not use Mozilla's software to access the site. Mozilla Chairwoman Mitchell Baker apologized for the company's actions in an open letter online Thursday, saying that Eich is stepping down for the company's sake. 'We didn't act like you'd expect Mozilla to act. We didn't move fast enough to engage with people once the controversy started. We're sorry. We must do better,' Baker wrote. She said that Mozilla believes both in equality and freedom of speech and that 'figuring out how to stand for both at the same time can be hard.' Mozilla is still discussing what is next for its leadership. A representative for Mozilla could not be reached immediately for further comment. Mozilla says about half a billion people around the world use Firefox, which has free, open software written in part by volunteers. Google's Chrome browser and Microsoft's Internet Explorer are more widely used across desktops, tablets and phones.

Mozilla infuriated many employees and users last week by hiring Eich to lead the Mountain View company. His . political contribution was publicly reported and drew some negative . attention two years ago, when Eich was Mozilla's chief technology . officer. But when he was promoted to CEO last week, his support of the . ban took on more gravitas. Three . of the Mozilla Foundation's six board members quit, according to a Wall . Street Journal blog, and thousands of employees and community members . weighed in on Twitter last weekend. On Monday, New York-based dating service OkCupid.com replaced its usual home page for users logging in with Firefox. 'Hello . there, Mozilla Firefox user.

Inequality: California's Proposition 8 essentially banned same-sex couples from getting married until it was deemed unconstitutional . I am deeply honored and humbled by the CEO role. I’m also grateful for the messages of support. At the same time, I know there are concerns about my commitment to fostering equality and welcome for LGBT individuals at Mozilla. I hope to lay those concerns to rest, first by making a set of commitments to you. More important, I want to lay them to rest by actions and results.A number of Mozillians, including LGBT individuals and allies, have stepped forward to offer guidance and assistance in this. I cannot thank you enough, and I ask for your ongoing help to make Mozilla a place of equality and welcome for all. Here are my commitments, and here’s what you can expect:    -Active commitment to equality in everything we do, from employment to events to community-building.    -Working with LGBT communities and allies, to listen and learn what does and doesn’t make Mozilla supportive and welcoming.    -My ongoing commitment to our Community Participation Guidelines, our inclusive health benefits, our anti-discrimination policies, and the spirit that underlies all of these.    -My personal commitment to work on new initiatives to reach out to those who feel excluded or who have been marginalized in ways that makes their contributing to Mozilla and to open source difficult. More on this last item below. I know some will be skeptical about this, and that words alone will not change anything. I can only ask for your support to have the time to “show, not tell”; and in the meantime express my sorrow at having caused pain.Mozilla is a movement composed of different people around the world, working productively together on a common mission. This is important to our ability to work and grow around the world.Many Mozillians and others know me as a colleague or a friend. They know that I take people as they come and work with anyone willing to contribute. At the same time, I don’t ask for trust free of context, or without a solid structure to support accountability. No leader or person who has a privileged position should. I want to be held accountable for what I do as CEO. I fully expect you all to do so.I am committed to ensuring that Mozilla is, and will remain, a place that includes and supports everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, economic status, or religion.You will see exemplary behavior from me toward everyone in our community, no matter who they are; and the same toward all those whom we hope will join, and for those who use our products. Mozilla’s inclusive health benefits policies will not regress in any way. And I will not tolerate behavior among community members that violates our Community Participation Guidelines or (for employees) our inclusive and non-discriminatory employment policies.You’ll also see more from Mozilla under my leadership in the way of efforts to include potential contributors, especially those who lack privilege. This entails several projects, starting with Project Ascend, which is being developed by Lukas Blakk. I intend to demonstrate with meaningful action my commitment to a Mozilla that lives up to its ideals, including that of being an open and inclusive community. Mozilla, which is promoted with the . slogan, 'Doing good is part of our code,' responded Monday with an . emailed statement saying the company supports equality for all, . including marriage equality for gay couples. 'No matter who you are or who you love, everyone deserves the same rights and to be treated equally,' said the statement. 'OkCupid never reached out to us to let us know of their intentions, nor to confirm facts.'

"By . James  Nye . Sordid new details about the night when Maryville teenager Daisy Coleman claims she was raped by high school senior, Matthew Barnett have been released by police in the Missouri town. In a taped interview with police, recorded just hours after the alleged assault, Barnett told police that he and the then 14-year-old did have sex in his house, but it was consensual and crucially, Coleman began drinking heavily afterwards. The newly released material from the police also reveals that Daisy admitted texting Barnett 'once a month' and indicated to the star-football player that she would provide him with sexual favors if he gave her alcohol. Scroll down for video . New revelations: Daisy Coleman told police that she traded suggestive text messages with Matthew Barnett before she was allegedly raped by the teen in Maryville in January 2012 . The case files from the police include the July 2012 criminal depositions of Daisy and her mother, Melinda Coleman. Daisy claims that before the allged incident, Barnett, who was 17 at the time, said, 'sometimes me and my friends would see if he would bring us alcohol.' Barnett tells police that he picked Daisy up from her house on January 8, 2012 and that she was not intoxicated but appeared 'buzzed'. Police also shared Daisy's text messages the night of the alleged assault, which show they did agree beforehand to meet. 'U wanna come drink wit me and chill,' wrote Barnett according to the files and tapes from ABC News. 'OMFG. Sweeet,' replied Coleman, who later wrote, 'do you want me to bring alchol [sic]?' Matthew Barnett, arriving at court in January (left). He was convicted of Child Endangerment but escaped sex . charges for the assault on Daisy Coleman Right, his High School Yearbook photo . While it is not disputed that Daisy drank at least five shots of vodka at Barnett's house on January 8, what is important is when she drank them. Missouri law states that a 14-year-old girl cannot consent to sex if she is incapacitated. Barnett has never disputed that he and Daisy had sex, but has insisted it was consensual and she was not drunk at the time. Another witness, a boy, at the house, said that Daisy drank heavily after her sexual encounter with Barnett. Daisy has always said that she sneaked out of her house with her friend after drinking and was picked up by Barnett who fed her shots in a tall glass causing her to blackout. She claims that Barnett then raped her and dropped her off in her own front yard in the freezing cold. The identities of alleged sex assault victims are generally not published, but Coleman's family decided to go public with her identity and accusations . The case divided the small town and Barnett has never been convicted of rape charges - which were dropped. Scene: Photo of Matthew Barnett's family basement where the teens were drinking on the night of January 8, 2012. Daisy has experience two years of bullying since . she accused Barnett. Pictured left at her home in Albany, and right, a . high school wrestling photograph . Daisy was suspended from the cheerleading team because she admitted to drinking and the family were forced to move, but that didn't stop the slew of online attacks. 'The stuff on Facebook and Twitter was just unbelievable, so horrible ... saying stuff like, 'Why don't you slit your wrists,' Daisy' mother, Melinda Coleman told 20/20 in a January interview. Then almost exactly two years after the initial incident, Daisy attempted to commit suicide for the third time after ingesting a mix of cough medicine and prescription drugs. The case was reignited in October 2013, when he Kansas City Star reported on the allegations and Robert Rice's decision to drop charges against Barnett, who was initially charged with felony sex and child endangerment. The state appointed a special prosecutor to re-investigate the case, which ended in Barnett pleading guilty to the misdemeanor charge on Jan. 9, 2014 - two years almost to the date of the alleged incident. Barnett and his attorney maintain that the fact that two independent investigations have cleared him proves that he didn't do anything wrong. Indeed, last month, depositions in the sexual assault case show contradictions in statements between Daisy and her mother. Bullied: Daisy and her family have reportedly been followed by private investigators and had to leave the Maryville after reporting the alleged rape . In more than 100 pages of testimony, the Colemans described the night in January 2012 when Daisy, who was 14 at the time, claims she was raped. Jackson County prosecuting attorney Jean Peters Baker served as special prosecutor after Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert Rice asked for someone else to review the evidence amid questions about why he dropped charges against the alleged attacker. The testimony describes how Daisy and a female friend had been drinking before asking Matt Barnett, then 17, to pick them up after they sneaked out of Daisy's home. Daisy claimed Barnett took her to his house, plied her with alcohol and raped her when she blacked out. Mrs Coleman found her daughter shivering on the front porch at about 5am the next day. According to the depositions released on Friday, Mrs Coleman told Rice that Daisy had been less than truthful on some things in her deposition and attributed that to the girl's embarrassment over the ordeal. Age difference: Daisy was a 14-year-old freshman at the time of the alleged assault while Matthew Barnett was a 17-year-old senior . For example, Rice at one point had asked Daisy about an incident in which she burned the name of a boy into her skin. Mrs Coleman said that it was Barnett's name; Daisy said in her deposition that it was another boy's name. At one point, the mother suggested that the contradictions would likely keep the case out of a courtroom. 'I don't think that you probably can try this case now. I think there's been too many lies,' she said, according to the newly released documents. The Colemans and their supporters later claimed Rice dropped a felony assault charge against Barnett because of insensitivity, prosecutorial ambivalence and political pressure from the boy's grandfather, a retired state trooper and four-term state legislator. Claims: Daisy alleged that Barnett took her to his house and gave her alcohol before assaulting her . Mrs Coleman told The Associated Press that she hadn't seen the depositions, which she claimed Rice had denied even existed, and she didn't believe some of what was purported to be in them. Quite frankly, Robert Rice is a liar and I wouldn't be surprised if he put that in there himself,' Mrs Coleman said. Daisy's story made headlines nationwide after The Kansas City Star published a 4,000-word article in October detailing the girl's claims against Barnett. The AP generally doesn't name the victims of sexual assault but it is naming Daisy because she and her mother granted public interviews. In January, Barnett pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment after Baker concluded there wasn't enough evidence for a felony conviction. Barnett has not denied the two had sex, but has insisted that it was consensual. Robert Sundell, an attorney who initially represented Barnett after he was charged, said on Friday he was glad the documents were released. 'If all of the records and all of the evidence were made public, I think it would be pretty easy for anyone to recognize why the case didn't go forward,' he said.","New tapes and documents from the alleged sexual assault of Daisy Coleman in Maryville in 2012 have been released .

The NYPD said Mr Rios hit his head on a piece of the subway's infrastructure around 10.15pm local time on Wednesday. Isabel Rios, 45, was found on top of the No.6 train in the Bronx and pronounced dead immediately (file picture) 'Subway surfing is simply one of the dumbest things you can do,' MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz told dnainfo.com. 'Don't do it.' Rios's body was later discovered on top of the train at Soundview in the Bronx. He was unresponsive and pronounced dead immediately. His fiancee's mother, Carol Parkman, told the Wall Street Journal that Rios was 'a really troubled artist'. 'He was very gifted and very talented,' she said. 'I admired his talent and his work.' In 2011 a YouTube video of a 'subway surfer' went viral in New York after he was pictured hanging onto the outside of a J Train.

Kyle Darker was discovered at his house in Eccles, Greater Manchester around 3.30 yesterday afternoon, and was airlifted to hospital. There are fears he might have been bullied at the school where he started less than a year ago, after friends suggested he had been tormented by other pupils. Relatives paid tribute to the Year Seven schoolboy, who turned 12 just two weeks ago, describing him as a talented pianist and passionate Manchester United fan whose death has 'left a big hole in our hearts'.

Officers say they are not treating Kyle's death as suspicious, but the circumstances of the tragedy will be the subject of an investigation. After a family member called an ambulance, Kyle was taken by helicopter to Salford Royal Hospital, but doctors were unable to save his life. The road where he lived with his mother Lorraine and stepfather Kevin was yesterday cordoned off by police as they gathered evidence. A Facebook tribute page set up in Kyle's memory received 1,700 visitors within less than 24 hours of his death. His aunt, Margaret Tunnacliffe, said: 'Tonight we lost our very happy, outgoing, funny little boy. Your loss has left another big hole in our hearts. We are going to miss you terribly sweetheart.'

Justice: Tierra's mother Amani Benton smiled in court today as her ex-fiance was convicted of their daughter's murder . Prosecutors had said he killed Tierra to get back at her mother for breaking off their engagement. They said he weighed down her pink car seat with a tire jack to ensure it would sink. Her body was pulled from a creek in Wall Township, about 20 miles from her Lakehurst home, with one tiny black and purple sneaker sticking out of the water.

Floored: Tierra's death sparked a week-long manhunt for her father across the U.S. Morgan's state of mind the day of his daughter's death was a key part of the case. In his opening statement, defense attorney Ryan Moriarty indicated Morgan would not deny responsibility for Tierra's death but told jurors their task was to decide 'what form of homicide applies to this defendant.' After her death, Morgan fled to California and was arrested several days later in San Diego, with a newspaper account of the killing in his pocket. The Monmouth County medical examiner said the toddler died from ""homicidal violence, including submersion in water."" He said the girl may have been conscious for three minutes after starting to breathe in water and could have remained alive for nearly five minutes after that. Defense lawyer Jeffrey Coghlan told jurors Tuesday that Morgan believed Tierra's mother's family wasn't raising her properly and that Morgan wasn't thinking clearly at the time Tierra died. On Wednesday, jurors asked the judge for a second glimpse of Morgan's video statement to police in San Diego. In the video, a detective asked Morgan if he said anything to his daughter before leaving her to die in the creek. 'I told her I loved her, and I gave her a kiss,' Morgan replied. Morgan insisted his daughter was not dead when he left the area. 'I still heard some noises,' he said. 'I heard her. She sounded like she was crying.' He said he drove away and never returned.","Arthur Morgan III was convicted of killing daughter Tierra Morgan-Glover after throwing her into a creek in November 2011 .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell may suddenly be looking past his state's Republican primary, after a tea party-linked conservative challenger was caught speaking at a pro-cockfighting rally on Saturday. Matt Bevin is challenging McConnell from the right, but his half-hour speech at the beginning of the rally has increased his statewide name-recognition in a way no politicians wants. Cockfighting is an intensely controversial blood sport in which roosters' claws are sharpened and fitted with razor-sharp 'spurs' – and fight to the death while spectators bet on them. 'Matt Bevin has no credibility left whatsoever,' McConnell's press secretary Allison Moore told MailOnline. 'At this point nothing surprises us with this guy.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Matt Bevin, a businessman who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Republican primary, spoke at a March 29 rally held by Kentucky cockfighting enthusiasts . Cockfighting is an age-old blood sport -- now outlawed -- in which roosters fight to the death, aided by finely honed claws and razor-sharp 'spurs' attached to their legs -- all while spectators gamble on the outcome . When The News Journal, a small newspaper in rural Corbin, Kentucky, first reported on Bevins' appearance at Saturday's rally, hosted by the American Gamefowl Defense Network, he insisted that he didn't know who he was speaking to. 'It was not a cockfighting rally, it was a states' rights rally,' Bevin spokeswoman Rachel Semmel told the Louisville Courier-Journal. The pro-cockfighting group advertised its Saturday event on its Facebook page, however, as a bid to organize 'a grassroots movement to legally protect gamefowl enthusiasts.' On Thursday the conservative businessman appeared on the Terry Meiners . radio show in Louisville, seemingly abandoning the I-didn't-know defense. 'It's . interesting,' he said. 'When you look at cockfighting and dogfighting . as well, this isn't something new. It wasn't invented in Kentucky, for . example.' 'I mean, the Founding Fathers were all – many of them – very actively involved in this and always have been.' Broadcast media have had a field day with Bevin. 'Cockfighting . is illegal in all 50 states, and is illegal in 41,' a shocked Mika . Brzezinski said Thursday on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' program. 'It's also . really sick.' McConnell will have an easier time in . the Republican primary against an opponent who is now linked to the . illegal practice. But in November he will need every vote he can muster . against Kentucky Attorney General Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat . with whom he's running neck-and-neck. The scenario of a razor-thin margin in the general election could make even cockfighters' votes critical. Craig Davis, president of the United Gamefowl Breeders Association, told the Lexington Herald-Leader in February that his group could swing as many as 60,000 voters toward McConnell – or tell them to stay home on Election Day. McConnell (C) leads Matt Bevin, his tea party challenger, but will face a tougher fight in the general election, making every vote -- even those of cockfighters -- critical; the lobby is furious with the senator for approving a Farm Bill that mad it a federal crime to attend an animal fight . Vicious: Before a cockfight, birds' claws are sharpened and 'spurs' -- pointed puncture-weapons -- are attached to their legs in order to make their attacks more lethal in the ring . Tradition? The University of South Carolina still proudly cheers on sports teams whose mascot is the 'Gamecock' Cockfighting is illegal in all 50 states, but Kentucky is one of nine states where it's not a felony. Penalties there for participating can include one year in jail after a Class A misdemeanor conviction. Spectators can expect only modest fines. But the 2014 federal farm bill, which McConnell supported, added time behind bars for merely attending a cockfight anywhere in the U.S. Animal fight spectators can now land in federal prison for up to one year. 'Knowingly' bringing a child under 16 to any such event is now a federal felony that carries a penalty of up to three years. 'This will destroy Mitch McConnell in Kentucky,' Davis said in February after President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. The lobbying arm of the Humane Society . of the United States, the nation's wealthiest animal rights group, is . calling for Bevin to abandon his campaign. He . 'showed appalling judgment in associating himself with this band of . lawbreakers and perpetrators of unspeakable animal cruelty,' Humane . Society Legislative Fund president Michael Markarian wrote on his blog. 'He’s brought discredit upon the state of Kentucky, and he should withdraw from the Senate race.' Fighting roosters are kept in dozens of states for underground matches, even though the practice is illegal in every state; Kentucky is one of just nine states that have not made participating in a cockfight a felony . Kentucky has a thriving community of cockfighting enthusiasts who insist that their hobby should be legal, and gather often -- in open meetings like this one in London, Ky. -- to show strength in numbers and pressure legislators . United Game Breeders Association president Craig Davis said in February that Sen. Mitch McConnell's vote in favor of a Farm Bill that turned attending a cockfight into a federal crime will 'destroy' him in Kentucky . Markarian is himself a controversial figure. In . 2009 a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against the Ringling brothers . circus, saying among other things that Markarian's group – then called . the Fund For Animals – paid thousands of dollars to the star witness in . the case. The judge ultimately ruled that the witness was 'a paid plaintiff.' The . Humane Society of the United States has an image problem in Kentucky as . well, since it raises tens of millions of dollars every year with ads . suggesting it's related to local 'humane society' shelters, but spends . much of that money advocating for vegetarianism and other positions that . make livestock farmers bristle. Semmel, Bevin's spokeswoman, did not respond to a message requesting comment. McConnell has hammered his tea party opponent in ads focusing on his 2008 defense of the federal government's unpopular $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program bailouts of Wall Street investment firms. 'Matt Bevin will say whatever he thinks people want to hear in the moment to try and make a quick sale,' Moore, the McConnell spokeswoman, told MailOnline. He 'claims to be a conservative business man but takes taxpayer funded bailouts for his uninsured business and supported TARP,' she said, 'claimed to have an MBA from MIT when he never even attended the school, and now he claims he didn't know he was giving a speech to cockfighters at a cockfighting rally.'","Cockfighting is illegal in all 50 states, a felony in 41, and a class A misdemeanor in Kentucky .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter .

County jury found Alexandru Hossu not guilty on Thursday on two counts . each of first- and second-degree rape of a 13-year-old girl. The . county's district attorney, Adam Levy, recused himself from the case in . March 2013, saying Hossu was a close friend and frequent houseguest. Westchester County prosecutors took over. A Putnam County jury found Alexandru Hossu not guilty on Thursday on two counts each of first- and second-degree rape of a 13-year-old girl . But . Putnam Sheriff Donald Smith, a fellow Republican and a political rival, . said Levy was interfering with the prosecution. Smith said that if Levy . had his way, 'Mr. Hossu would never have been brought to justice for . his crime and Mr. Levy's relationship with him would never have been . brought to the light of public scrutiny.' Levy . sued the sheriff for $5 million, claiming defamation and calling Smith 'an out-of-control sheriff who does not care about the truth.' Smith . denied defaming Levy. The case is pending. Levy's . mother, Judy Sheindlin, is the star of Judge Judy and issued a . statement at the time calling her son 'principled, honorable and . dedicated.' Alexandru Hossu, a 36-year-old immigrant from Romania , was a former personal trainer of Adam Levy, pictured right with his mom Judge Judy . On Thursday she said: 'The 12 people who had the opportunity . to evaluate the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses delivered . their verdict. I can only hope that having been acquitted, that Alex can . get his life back.' In . October, Levy acknowledged he had helped pay for Hossu's defense. And he . said he doubted Hossu could hurt a child. Levy's brother-in-law . eventually took over the defense. In November, the prosecutor on the case told the judge Levy was interfering. Some local politicians called for an investigation. Levy, . however, said he had fulfilled his 'ethical, moral and legal . obligations' by recusing himself and cooperating with the prosecution. No charges have been filed against Levy. Hossu, . a 36-year-old immigrant from Romania who also is Levy's former personal . trainer, was accused of raping the daughter of his former girlfriend. TV favourite: She is pictured speaking on her reality television courtroom series 'Judge Judy' At . the trial in Carmel, 50 miles north of Manhattan, the girl testified . that Hossu raped her in 2010. She said he 'snapped' when she refused his . offer for help with her homework. Hossu . did not take the stand, but the evidence included a phone call from the . girl to Hossu last year, made at the suggestion of prosecutors and . recorded without Hossu's knowledge. On the call, he denied the assault . and called the allegations ridiculous. Jurors heard him say, 'I never touched you in an inappropriate manner.' On . Wednesday, after three hours of deliberation, the jury reported it was . deadlocked, but the judge said to keep trying for a verdict.

"By . James Rush . Texas Governor Rick Perry is planning to travel to the South Pacific to help in the search for missing American Second World War fighters . The Governor of Texas Rick Perry has said he plans to travel to the South Pacific to join a team searching for American serviceman who went missing during the Second World War. The governor and first lady are due to travel to Palau to join the volunteers who believe they have found two wreck sites containing the remains of missing airmen. The BentProp Project, which found the sites last month, have been searching crash sites for years looking for American servicemen shot down over Palau between 1944 and 1945 by the Japanese. The group is now expected to receive help from the governor, who will be joined on his 12-day trip by World War Two veteran Romus Valton 'R.V.' Burgin and retired U.S. Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell. Gov Perry said in a statement: 'Somewhere in the waters of Palau, or deep within its marshy jungles, lie the answers some families have been waiting generations to hear. 'The BentProp Project has made a mission of finding those answers, and I’m honored to lend a hand to the 2014 expedition, both in the field and in spreading the word about this exceptional program.' Gov Perry's expenses are to be paid for by the BentProp Project, The Dallas Morning News reported. It is not known whether Wednesday's attack at the military base in Fort Hood, Texas, in which a soldier turned his gun on himself after killing three people and wounding 16 others, will affect the governor's plans. The governor and first lady are due to travel to Palau to join a search team of volunteers who believe they have found two wreck sites containing the remains of airmen missing for 70 years . The BentProp Project has been conducting month-long searches at Palau every year since 1999.So far the group has managed to help find and recover the remains of eight American MIAs. Member Reid Joyce told FoxNews.com: 'It doesn’t take long to realize the real importance of what we’re doing, to completely buy-in to the mission, and to find these guys after 70 years is pretty satisfying.' The group, which uses maps, GPS and Googe Earth to try and find the wreck sites, have been searching in Palau on their latest expedition since March 15. Just over a week later the team found the first site, understood to be the wreckage of a General Motors TBM Avenger which crashed into the water following a mission to bomb a power plant. A blog post on the group's website explained how up to three MIAs were associated with the aircraft. The team wrote: 'So many people had a hand in making this happen. Nine years ago, a Palauan showed us a wing of an Avenger deep in a mangrove swamp. The governor and the first lady will be joined on the12-day trip by World War Two veteran Romus Valton 'R.V.' Burgin and retired U.S. Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell . 'The mangrove trees had grown enough to lift the entire wing up out of the water. No other parts were around. He has since died without knowing that the path he started us down came to fruition. 'Then a Palauan friend of BentProp's told us a few years later that her father told her of watching the airplane get hit and crashing off the coast. 'She even pointed to the area where we eventually found the aircraft. So her father's recollections were passed on to the next generation, and on to us, intact. We're calling her soon to let her know her father had it right.' The team then found the second crash site - a Grumman F4F Hellcat, shot down by enemy ground fire - just four days later.","BentProp Project found two sites containing remains of missing airmen .

"By . Associated Press . A Phoenix man who told police he killed his 12-year-old half-brother last month because he 'just felt like killing' is now accused of fatally stabbing a cellmate, authorities said Thursday. Andrew Ward, 27, was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder in the Wednesday night killing of cellmate Douglas Walker, 33, in a Maricopa County jail in Phoenix, the Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Walker was stabbed in the eyes with a golf pencil, the statement said. His throat was cut with a plastic playing card, he was beaten, his head was smeared with peanut butter, and paramedics later discovered that his breathing passages were obstructed by a plastic bag, the office said. Repeat offender: Andrew Ward, 27 (left), previously admitted to killing his half-brother last month. While being held at the Maricopa County Jail Wednesday night, he killed again - this time stabbing to death his cellmate, 33-year-old Douglas Walker (right) Officers discovered Walker's injuries when they went to the locked cell after inmates said there was a fight, the office said. Ward immediately admitted to sheriff's detectives that he had choked and beaten Walker, the office's statement said. 'Ward told sheriff's detectives that he had no regrets for the attack.' Ward previously pleaded not guilty in the March 12 killing of Austin Tapio, his half-brother. Ward was arrested after calling 911 from a convenience store near his family's home. The boy had multiple stab wounds. Police said when asked why he killed the boy, Ward said, 'Honestly, I just felt like killing.' Family: Walker pleaded not guilty to killing his 12-year-old half-brother Austin Tapio (pictured), even though he told police he committed the crime . Marci Kratter, Ward's defense lawyer in the March killing, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday. The Sheriff's Office said Ward and Walker had been housed together the past three weeks in the Lower Buckeye Jail. 'Prior to the March arrest, Ward had been in jail on 11 different occasions since 2006 with no major disciplinary problems or notable institutional history,' the office's statement said. According to online court records, Walker was awaiting an April 11 sentencing after he pleaded guilty last month to armed robbery. He had been in custody since November, the Sheriff's Office said. In mid-January, an inmate at the same county jail was fatally beaten and stabbed with a small pencil by his cellmate. The Sheriff's Office said 20-year-old Nike Black is charged with killing 50-year-old John Klatt and that the two had no known previous conflicts. Klatt was awaiting trial on charges of sexual exploitation of a minor, while Black faced charges of domestic violence, assault and criminal trespassing. Black now also faces a murder charge.","Andrew Ward, 27, was arrested last month after admitting to police he stabbed his 12-year-old half-brother Austin Tapia to death .

"By . Associated Press . A serial killer was put to death Thursday in Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his lawyers' demand that the state release information about where it gets its lethal injection drug. Tommy Lynn Sells, 49, was the first inmate to be injected with a dose of newly replenished pentobarbital that Texas prison officials obtained to replace an expired supply of the powerful sedative. Sells declined to give a statement. As the drug began flowing into his arms inside the death chamber in Huntsville, Sells took a few breaths, his eyes closed and he began to snore. After less than a minute, he stopped moving. He was pronounced dead at 6:27 p.m. CDT - 13 minutes after being given the pentobarbital. Scroll down for video . Convicted killer: Tommy Lynn Sells was put to death Thursday with the lethal drug pentobarbital . Terry Harris, whose 13-year-old daughter, Kaylene Harris, was fatally stabbed by Sells in 1999 in South Texas, watched as Sells was executed, saying the injection was 'way more gentle than what he gave out.' 'What a great day!' the father said as witnesses turned to leave the death house. Sells' lawyers had made a plea to the Supreme Court earlier in the day after a federal appeals court on Wednesday allowed the execution to remain on schedule. A lower court had stopped the execution Wednesday, ordering the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to reveal more information about its drug supplier, but the ruling was quickly tossed on appeal. Sells, who claims to have committed as many as 70 killings across the U.S., also lost an appeal before the high court that contended his case should be reviewed because he had poor legal help during his murder trial. Victims: Kaylene Harris (left), 13, was killed in her own bed by Sells, and her friend Krystal Surles (right) almost died after he slashed her throat . In their drug argument, Sells' attorneys argued they needed to know the name of the pharmacy now . providing the state with pentobarbital used during executions in order . to verify the drug's quality and protect Sells from unconstitutional . pain and suffering. But the . Supreme Court, like the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, sided with . Texas prison officials, who argued that information about the drug . supplier must be kept secret to protect the pharmacy from threats of . violence. The high court justices did not elaborate on why they made the . decision, which came about an hour before Sells' scheduled execution. State . attorneys argued the new pentobarbital stock falls within the . acceptable ranges of potency. Sells' attorneys said they had no way of . confirming that. Death penalty state: A corrections officer keeps watch outside the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Huntsville Unit in Huntsville, Texas . The Supreme . Court last month rejected similar arguments from a Missouri inmate's . attorneys who challenged the secrecy surrounding where that state . obtained its execution drugs, and the condemned prisoner was put to . death. Questions about the . source of execution drugs have arisen in several states in recent months . as numerous drugmakers - particularly in Europe, where opposition to . capital punishment is strongest - have refused to sell their products if . they will be used in executions. That's . led several state prison systems to compounding pharmacies, which are . not as heavily regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as . more conventional pharmacies. A . batch of pentobarbital that Texas purchased from a compounding pharmacy . in suburban Houston expired at the end of March.

"By . Sara Malm . A Swedish couple made an unusual discovery when they renovated their living room - a gravestone. Gert Nilsson was digging up the floor his lounge in Fuglie, near Malmö, southern Sweden, when his shovel hit something, quite literally, rock solid. The headstone is well preserved and fully legible, and carries the names of two men and one woman who died in the mid-1800s. Grave find: The 6ft 7in headstone was found by Gert Nilsson while he was renovating his lounge, and carries the names of two men and one woman who lived on their farm in the mid-1800s . Mr Nilsson is a carpenter and has spent the past few years renovating the family home, and made his discovery working on a room in the former farm-hand’s quarters. When digging underneath the floorboards in the living room, he uncovered the gravestone. ‘I was digging away to get a bit further down when my shovel hit something hard,’ Gert Nilsson told Kvallsposten. ‘When I kept going and cleared away the dirt around it, I thought “it’s a bloody gravestone”’. It is nearly 6ft7in long and four inches thick and carries three names and death dates. Mystery solved: The headstone is thought to have been moved from a nearby church when the graveyard was rebuilt in 1904 (stock image) Jöns Eriksson, who died 1843,  Måns Nilsson, who died in 1851, and then ‘their spouse’ Karna Månsdotter, who died in 1884, aged 68. ‘I suspect Karna was married to Jöns and then Måns,’ says Gert’s wife Carin Nilsson. All three lived on ‘Fuglie Number 19’, the same farm property that Mr and Mrs Nilsson now live in. However, the farm-hands quarter where the stone was found was not built until more than a decade after the death of Karna Månsdotter. Local priest Inger Krigström’s theory is that the stone was removed from the grave after a new church was built in 1904 and so the family of Månsdotter took the stone and put it under the floor. Mrs Nilsson has since tried to track down information about Karna Månsdotter and her supposed husbands. Mr Nilsson plans to dig up the stone this weekend and move it into the garden.","Swedish family finds 19th-century gravestone underneath floor .

"By . Associated Press . A city board on Thursday gave a Muslim group the go-ahead to remove six crosses from the roof and spires of a century-old former Catholic church so the now-vacant Gothic structure can be used as a mosque. More than 200 people had signed an online petition calling on the Syracuse Landmark Preservation Board to deny an application by North Side Learning Center, the church's new owner, to remove the crosses and build a six-foot chain-link fence. Before the vote to allow the church alterations, Chairman Don Radke said the board cannot interfere with a decision that involves religious freedom. Old church, new mosque: Mirza Tihic, top, and Abdulilah Al-Dubai work on the flag pole out front of the former Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church in Syracuse, NY, as they replace the American flag that had been stolen . About a dozen people who spoke at the meeting were evenly divided for and against the church conversion, The Post-Standard reported. Petition-signers, who included some local residents and former church parishioners, had argued that the former Holy Trinity Catholic Church was a neighborhood landmark built by German immigrants 100 years ago and removing the crosses would deface the architecture. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse closed the church in 2010 and merged the parish with that of St. John the Baptist because of a declining congregation as population shifted from the city to suburbs. The North Side Learning Center, a nonprofit group that provides literacy programs for immigrants, bought the church and its school and rectory for $150,000 in December. Yusuf Soule, the center's director, has been the public point-person for the mosque effort. He said the crosses must be removed because the Islamic faith prohibits worship of idols and symbols. A report by the nonprofit Onondaga Citizens League last summer said more than 7,200 refugees have resettled in the Syracuse area over the past 10 years, with the majority from Burma, Bhutan and Somalia.","North Side Learning Center, an Islamic group, has been given permission to cut the crosses off a former Catholic church .

Tower climbs are held in high-profile buildings around the world, including the Empire State Building. The event on Thursday was sanctioned, unlike a recent spate of unauthorized visits by thrill-seekers to the site. Sixteen-year-old Justin Casquejo, of Weehawken, N.J., was arrested last month after getting through a hole in the fence surrounding the 104-story 1 World Trade Center and taking the elevator to the spire. A judge has ordered Casquejo to be assessed in a program for youthful offenders. He faces charges including criminal trespass. In September, three people parachuted from the building, producing a video of their jump. When the first visitors make their way through the doors of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum next month they will be confronted with a stark wall bearing a dedication to all those who lost their lives that day. On the wall, which stands in front of a repository containing about 8,000 remains from the 2,749 victims, is the quotation: 'No day shall erase you from the memory of time. Virgil.' The seemingly poignant sentiment spans 60 feet and each of the 15inch letters is made from Twin Towers steel. Directors of the museum say the quote 'speaks to the indelibility of our memories'. An early rendering of the inscription at the National September 11 Memorial Museum, which is set to open next week . But the choice of quotation has sparked controversy just weeks before the opening. The line comes from the ninth book of the Aeneid. It refers to two Trojan soldiers Nisus and Euryalus, who raid their enemy's camp at night, slaughtering sleeping soldiers in an orgy of violence. For this, the enemy kill them as they try to flee, impaling their heads on spears. 'If we take into account its original context, the quotation is more applicable to the aggressors in the 9/11 tragedy than to those honored by the memorial,' Helen Morales, a classics professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara told The New York Times. 'So my first reaction is that the quotation is shockingly inappropriate for the U.S. victims of the 9/11 attack.' Museum director Alice Greenwald said the quote was selected for the reference to one day, rather than the narrative of the classic story. She said: 'What resonated with us, and with everyone who reviewed its use in the context of the museum, was the reference to a single day not being able to erase the memory of those we love.'","Firefighters from New York and New Jersey took part in the event to honour those lost on September 11 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Middle class families are being prices out of buying their own home, Vince Cable has warned. The Business Secretary sounded the alarm on the housing bubble, warning homes were now ‘unaffordable’ for many. Mr Cable insisted the only way to solve the problem was to ‘build many more houses’. Business Secretary Vince Cable warned buying a home was now unaffordable for people on middle incomes . House prices are soaring by up to 18 per cent across the country, according to Nationwide. Britain’s biggest building society said property values have now been rising for 15 straight months, the longest run since the credit crunch began in 2007. Manchester was the fastest riser last year - up 18 per cent, compared with 17 per cent for London. Parts of the capital, such as Lambeth and Brent, saw extraordinary growth of 30 per cent. Prices went up 14 per cent last year in Brighton and Cambridge and 13 per cent in Oxford and Carlisle. Mr Cable told The Independent: ‘The fundamental problem is a chronic imbalance between supply and demand. A recovering mortgage market is just fuelling demand again. ‘A family on average income is nowhere near able to afford a house at the average price. Property has become much more unaffordable for people on middle incomes.' In the mid-1990s the average home cost around three times average earnings. The figure peaked at more than six times before the 2007 crash, before slumping. But it has now crept back up to 5.5 times average incomes, Mr Cable warned. Earlier this week Tory housing minister Kris Hopkins said it is a ‘good thing’ that property prices are rising. ‘I bought a house and I expect the value to rise, and I'm sure you did as well,’ he told Jeremy Paxman on BBC2’s Newsnight. Chancellor George Osborne insisted he was being 'vigilant' of the problems in the housing market . But Mr Cable insisted: ‘I do not agree with Kris Hopkins that rising house prices are a good thing. If you are an owner-occupier who has paid off your mortgage, it is an increase in your paper or real wealth. ‘But if you are a young family trying to get into the housing market and it is unaffordable, it is an extremely bad thing. ‘The number of council houses actually fell under Labour. But more needs to be done. We must build many more houses - that and only that is the solution to our housing problem.’ Chancellor George Osborne yesterday spoke of the need to be ‘vigilant’ about increases in housing prices. But he insisted that fears of a bubble should not get in the way of giving older people more flexibility on how they deal with their pensions. Challenged over warnings of a house price bubble, Mr Osborne told the Treasury select committee: ‘I say we have to be vigilant. I think we have to keep a close eye. ‘There is of course a regional variation in this. I think you should at least draw a distinction between some of the phenomena in central London, which is caused by international money and the like coming into central London as a form of investment, and what you see in most of the places represented by members of this committee. That's just a feature of our housing market. ‘Ultimately, I want to live in a country where people who have the aspiration and who can afford to buy their own home are able to do so, and that means that we need to build homes for them.’","Business Secretary warns of 'imbalance between supply and demand'

"By . Luke Garratt . Colin Noddings, who walked free from court from charges of stalking the son of his ex-wife who he strangled to death . A killer who stalked the son of his ex-wife, who he strangled to death, has walked free from court. Colin Noddings, 63, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, throttled his former wife Deana Noddings, 46, in 2005 after finding out she had cheated on him as they were rekindling their relationship. Since his release for manslaughter he started a campaign of harassment against the son of his ex-wife, John Brown-Hunter including one letter that read 'I could find you in two minutes, just like I found your mum'. He was charged with harassment and stalking, but has now walked free from jail, having been handed a six-month suspended sentence. A representative of anti-soft justice campaigners Civitas, David Green, said the six month suspended sentence was 'a scandalously feeble response.' Green said: 'Mr Noddings is a convicted killer and since his early release from prison has threatened the life of the murder victim’s son. 'The suspended sentence might as well have been an absolute discharge. 'As . so often happens, the judicial system has failed miserably to protect a . member of the public who lives in constant, realistic fear of death or . injury.' Eight years ago, Noddings was sentenced to eight years imprisonment for manslaughter in July 2006 after being cleared of murder by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court. After a brief re-kindling of their estranged relationship, which was described in court as a 'fatal attraction', his ex-wife was unfaithful. Noddings claimed his wife’s infidelity had pushed him over the edge, so he throttled her. Bizarrely, in a letter written around a year before she was strangled, Mrs Noddings foretold her death at the hands of her ex-husband. The . letter read: 'Should anything untoward happen to me, I want it in black . and white...that this would be done by my ex-husband. I know what he is . like.' Noddings strangled his wife to death in a jealous rage on November 1, 2005, after uncovering his wife had carried out a seventh affair. Then, after he killed her, Noddings erected a sign outside of their home in . in Goldsby, Lincolnshire, that told his neighbours of his partner's infidelity. Noddings was sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court, to a six month suspended sentence for harassing John Brown Hunter, who was set to inherit his ex-wife's estate . Mr Noddings was released from jail in 2009, after serving less than half of his sentence. Upon his release, he started harassing Mrs Nodding’s son, who was set to inherit Mrs Noddings’ estate, using a series of letters and Facebook messages. Sara French, prosecuting, told the court, Noddings had started posted messages on his Facebook profile saying, 'Roll on November, when my licence is over, the fun begins' referring to his early release. Another said: 'Re-post this if you know someone who is alive because you cannot afford a hit man.' Things escalated in Autumn after Noddings posted a message on his profile saying 'I have friends in Froden Brook', which was identified as the place in Billericay in Essex where Mr Brown-Hunter was living at the time. Later Noddings sent a message to a friend of Mr Brown-Hunter, saying he was heading to his home town. The court heard Mr Brown-Hunter was so frightened of his step-dad that he moved his family out of their home and to his in-law’s house. Noddings has now been found guilty of one charge of stalking Mr Brown-Hunter between March 2013 and December 2013. The former classic car restorer had been described as having a tumultuous relationship with his former wife. One of Noddings' harassing messages said that he had friends on Froden Brook (pictured) where the son of his ex-wife lived . Noddings met his wife in the 1970s, but their marriage started to break down when Mrs Noddings conducted a number of affairs involving 'bondage sessions'. The court heard she had the affairs after becoming unhappy with her marriage due to her husband’s controlling nature. The couple divorced and Mrs Noddings moved to Lincolnshire to avoid continuous harassment ex-husband. But years later the couple rekindled their relationship, in what Noddings described in court as their 'fatal attraction' that eventually led to her death. Sentencing . Noddings for manslaughter in July 2006, Mr Justice Nelson described him . as 'an obsessive, possessive and besotted man'. He . said: 'The previous day you discovered her with her lover, one of . several she had had through the years of a tempestuous and volatile . relationship. 'You were suffering from very powerful and mixed emotions. 'It was this provocation which triggered you into doing that which you had contemplated.'","Colin Noddings, from Lincolnshire, throttled his ex-wife to death in 2005 .

"By . Richard Spillett . They may not be the first images that come to mind when you think of the First World War. But these pictures of women getting to work on the home front are just some of the extraordinary photos uncovered for a new exhibition about the war's impact the lives of ordinary people. Alongside the more well-known scenes of soldiers living in the trenches are pictures of the wives and girlfriends they left behind, as they get to work doing jobs usually reserved for their husbands and boyfriends. A group of women workers of the glucose factory of Messrs Nicholls, Nagel & Co in Trafford Park, Manchester, circa 1918 . Women workers in a Lancashire oil and cake factory having a tea break, 1918, left, and a woman pupil at the Cheshire Agricultural College being taught how to handle cattle during a course on animal husbandry . The exhibition shows photos of women getting used to working in factories in the North East, as well as learning new skills in agricultural colleges hastily set up to teach a new workforce how to farm. Entire streets in Lancashire were emptied of their men as hundreds joined up to so-called 'pals' regiments made up of football clubs, factory workforces or social clubs. As pictures show them marching through the streets, packing onto ships across the channel and preparing their trenches in France, space is also given the hard work put in by their other halves back in Britain. Original posters from the time also give an insight into daily life in Britain. One tells women to pack their partners off to the front or risk 'prolonging the war'. Another urges readers not to dress extravagantly in times of war, as it is 'worse than bad form, it's unpatriotic'. Graham Boxer, director of Imperial War Museum North, said: ‘One hundred years on, the objects we display highlight the poignancy and courage of people who shaped and were shaped by this first global conflict. 'Even a century later there are stories untold, experiences undiscovered and tales that will surprise.’ Recruitment posters appealing to women to encourage their men to join the armed forces and use fewer resources for the war effort . Female workers tow a trolley of raw rubber from a warehouse at the factory of Charles Macintosh and Sons Ltd in Manchester in September 1918 . Wounded soldiers being wheeled about the grounds of the American Red Cross Military Hospital in Liverpool in August 1918 . Among the photos and posters are also poignant letters and notes written between families as they were torn apart by events in Europe. One note, written by a Frank Middleton as he left his home in Eccles reads simply: 'Please don't weep'. Records show he was tragically killed the following year. Another letter is written by William Anderson, from Liverpool, to his wife, who was at home with his baby daughter in 1916. After watching his friends die in battle, he asks whether he should desert, but records show he stayed and died the following year. The exhibition also shows letters written between Ada and Rhoda McGuire, two sisters living in Liverpool, both in their early 30s, to their sister, Eva, who lived with her husband Ralph in Boston in the USA. On 7 August 1914, Ada writes: 'The Stock Exchange here is closed and everything has risen in price…Thank God Ralph won’t have to go to the war. Arthur Brown has gone…Bob Harley and heaps of others. 'Sports have all had to be put off because the men are called away.' A working party of the Manchester Regiment moving up to the trenches near Serre in France, January 1917 . Soldiers of the Lancashire Fusiliers, 29th Division, are seen on board an old Royal Navy battleship before they disembarked at beaches off Cape Helles on 5 May 1915 and Lancashire Fusiliers in a flooded communication trench near Ploegsteert Wood, Flanders in January 1917 .

Miss McGuire later tells how a half-German . teacher in Liverpool was forced to resign, writing: 'There has been . quite a sensation here at Somerville school. 'Miss . Coates, the head teacher of the seniors, made some anti-British . statements to the girls…Well, the mothers fairly mobbed her. She had to . be guarded by policemen.' She later writes: 'We are on rations here now. We manage to get enough . to eat, however, though not too much. Meat and butter are the least . plentiful. No sugar is served in the cafes – you must take your own.' From Street To Trench: A World War That Shaped A Region, is at the Imperial War Museum North in Trafford Wharf Road, Manchester from April 5 until May 31. It is the first exhibition by the Imperial War Museums to mark the centenary of the First World War and features more than 200 objects, photographs, letters, diaries, artworks, film clips and sound recordings from the conflict, many of which are on public display for the first time.","New exhibition shows the lives of women left in Britain after hundreds of men signed up to fight on the Western Front .

"By . Jennifer Newton . An unknown man who captured his own image in a photobooth 445 times over 30 years is proving to be a mystery. Starting in the 1930s, he took black and white selfies in a photobooth over three decades until the 1960s, charting his passage through time. Most of the pictures show the mystery man grinning at the camera in the photobooth while others show him almost scowling as his mood changes. For three decades this unknown man took over 445 selfies in photobooths from the 1930s to the 1960s. They now form a new exhibition at Rutgers University . It is thought the man may have been a photobooth technician and took the pictures as a way of testing the equipment . Nobody knows for sure exactly who the man is, or indeed why he took the pictures of himself over the 30 years, especially as taking self portraits were a lot harder back then. In some of the pictures he is seen sporting a fedora and smoking a pipe, while other times he is dressed in a suit. The pictures are now being shared in an exhibition at Rutgers University in New Jersey in an appropriately named show called '445 Portraits of Man'. Nobody knows for sure exactly who the man is, or indeed why he took the pictures of himself over the 30 year period . The exhibit is being shown at the Rutgers' Zimmerli Art Museum in New Brunswick and they say they are taking these early selfies and showing them as art. The images on display of the unknown man were taken during a time when photobooths were hugely popular in the United States. The 445 prints are owned by historian Donald Lokuta, who bought the pictures two years ago at a New York City antiques show. The pictures are owned by historian Donald Lokuta, who bought the images at an antiques show in New York City in 2012 . He originally only came across a handful of the photographs but the dealer told him there were hundreds more images of the man and he decided to buy them all. Mr Lokuta told Rutgers: 'As a historian, I knew this was very rare, but on a deeper level, I wondered, ""Why would somebody want to take almost 500 photos of himself in a photobooth?""' 'Thereâ€™s quite an age difference in the photos: You see him as younger man and then with a white, receding hairline and wrinkles.' It is thought the mystery man in the pictures could be from the Midwest and it is hoped the exhibition will shed new light on his identity . Mr Lokuta also added that based on conversations with another historian, it could be likely that the mystery man was a photobooth technician, who was taking the pictures to test out the equipment. It is also likely that he hailed from the U.S. Midwest, and it is hoped the exhibition will shed new light on who the man is. It is thought the photos originated previously from an auction in Michigan.","Unknown man took 445 selfies between the 1930s and 1960s .

"By . Luke Garratt . He is a bald, tall, male barber and grandfather. She is his blonde girlfriend. Somehow, he was able to travel on an international flight with her passport, without a word from any authorities he passed on the way. Neil Clulow, 50, didn't notice he had grabbed his partner Karen Clift's travel documents when he left for his flight to Alicante from Birmingham Airport to celebrate a 50th birthday in Benidorm where he was staying with friends. Because he was only travelling with hand luggage, Neil only had to show his boarding pass to get through airport security. The passport of Neil Clulow (left) and Karen Clift (right). Clulow used Clift's passport by mistake when travelling to Spain, but still managed to board the plane, as no one noticed his error . Spot the difference: Neil Clulow, left, was able to board a plane with his girlfriend's passport, which he took to the airport by accident, despite the fact that his girlfriend, Karen Clift, right, is a blonde woman and not a bald man . The grandfather-of-five had breakfast at the airport, and then flashed his passport to a Monarch Airlines member of staff at the gate and boarded the plane. And after the two-and-three-quarter hour flight, he successfully breezed through passport control at Alicante Airport without a word from the Spanish authorities. He only realised his mistake when he and his friends were comparing passport pictures and he discovered he had used his partner's documents. Neil, who is bald and has a goatee, said he was astonished authorities had failed to pick up on the mistake even though his girlfriend, also 50, has long, blonde hair. Neil Clulow (front) pictured with his friends in Spain. He realised the mistake when he got to Alicante where he was celebrating a friend's birthday . Mr Clulow, from Halesowen, West . Midlands, said: 'I handed my passport over with the boarding card when . we went to board the plane and she scanned them. 'Then we got in to Spain and went through passport control and I flashed the passport and they never said anything. 'Me and my mates were joking about our bad passport pictures and they looked at mine and said ""Neil, you're much better looking in this picture than in real life"". 'I can't believe this could happen, especially after all the trouble with the missing Malaysian aircraft. It's astounding. Mr Clulow was flying to Alicante from Birmingham Airport, where it is their policy to only check boarding passes in the event of someone boarding a flight with just hand luggage . In Mr Clulow's case it was up to the airline to check that his passport details were in order . 'With this plane going missing and people on there with the wrong passport you would've thought they would have been a bit more vigilant. 'f I can get through then who knows what else could happen. 'I got through on to the plane and got through passport control in Spain and didn't get stopped by one person. It's frightening. 'They need to crack down at British airports big time. It does need addressing.' Neil had to pay £70 to have his passport sent to Spain via UPS, but was forced to wait in the hotel for the entire three-day break because it needed to be signed for. A Monarch Airlines employee failed to check the passport details, and neither did border control staff in Spain . Further delays came when the company accidentally sent the document to Berlin before redirecting it to Benidorm - meaning he missed his flight home on March 19. Luckily, Monach Airlines bosses agreed to fly him back the next day for free and two suited representatives were even waiting for him when he landed. Neil, who has five children from another relationship and has been with receptionist Karen, for 12 months, said they were both worried about the mistake. He said: 'I phoned my girlfriend and asked her to send it by DHL but they wouldn't take it because it was a passport. 'We said it was important travel documents to UPS and they collected it, it cost me £70. 'They got it on the first plane but it went to Berlin. Then it was in Barcelona on the Wednesday  but it didn't reach Alicante so I lost my flight. 'It arrived on a day later and I flew back then. After the two-and-three-quarter hour flight, he even successfully got through airport security in Spain with his girlfriend's passport . 'It completely ruined my holiday. I couldn't leave the hotel because I was waiting and needed to sign it and UPS kept saying it would be there and it kept getting delayed. 'It was a waste of a break and I lost a day of work as well because I should have been home on the Thursday. 'There were two suited and booted Monarch reps waiting with a plaque with my name on it when I landed. 'They wanted to know what happened. 'They asked if I would be willing to point out the woman who let me through because it was a serious breach of security. 'But I didn't want to do that to her so I refused. I've heard nothing from them since.' Birmingham airport explained that when a passenger has only hand luggage, they only have to present their boarding pass to pass through to the departure lounge, where it is then the airline's responsibility to check that a passenger has the correct passport. Monarch has been sought for comment. U.S Judge Jean Louis Bruguiere, expert on terrorism who investigated a terrorist cell, said: 'For these groups, passports are as important as weapons.' Al Qaeda terrorism networks have been using false passports for years in order to carry out attacks on different countries. Notorious terrorist, Ahmed Ressam, used a counterfeit French passport to enter Canada and apply for political asylum. While living there, he supplied fake Canadian passports to other Algerians, also using a fake Canadian passport under the alias of Benni Noris in his failed attempt to enter the United States and bomb Los Angeles International Airport. Al Qaeda depends on the ability to travel internationally in order to raise funds, recruit operatives, train the operatives in Afghanistan and send them out to plan and conduct terrorist attacks. One of the first lines of defence against this is airport and airline security checks, so airports and airline staff have to be increasingly vigilant about their fake passports in order to prevent attacks.","Neil Clulow, 50, able to fly on flight to Alicante with girlfriend's passport .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Crammed full of dusty syringes, bottled antidotes, and rattling equipment - with a half-smoked pipe on the table - the owner of this doctor's surgery could have just popped out. But in fact it has lain derelict for more than a decade - and gathered a thick layer of dust over the years. Abandoned in mysterious circumstances, the mansion in Virton, Belgium, still has semi-full glasses of wine on the tables, and meticulously ordered equipment in antique glass cabinets smothered in cobwebs. Bygone era: The equipment in this old doctor's surgery in Virton, Belgium, was left in perfect order when it was abandoned in 1980 - despite slight decay . Ghost-like: The doctor's unfinished cigar, glasses and newspaper were left on the table as if he were half-way through his morning reading . French photographer Matti Decaux, 27, who found the home, said: 'This one is a strange for me, as it seems to be part home, part office and part surgery. 'It really felt odd wandering around, as it was as if the owner had just left for a paper and would return at any moment - the only way to tell otherwise was the layer of dust covering the contents of the property. 'The surgery area was very interesting as there was old equipment left behind, and it was all neatly laid out. Historic: The medicines cluttered around the house look ancient compared to our plastic packets today. Syringes and scalpels lie sprawled over glass-topped desks . Not quite the NHS: Patients would recline in a king size bed with plush blue satin sheets and a gold wooden frame facing the open windows . Mysteriously, open bottles and half-filled glasses remain on the tables, with coats slung on the back of the beautiful, velvet chairs . 'But, to be honest, with it being a . multi-use building there was much to see, all of which seemed as though . it was very well cared for when the owner was still there.' Seemingly abandoned at some point in the 1980s, the house in the south of Belgium has been dubbed 'Dr Pepito's mansion' and is made up of three stories - part residential and part surgery. Mr Decaux, 27, says: 'I receive a very mixed reaction from people who see these photographs. 'Some love to see them and hear the tales of what once may have gone on in there. Although, some will just never understand why I find these places interesting. 'I really enjoy capturing places that once were loved but now have been left for Mother Nature to reclaim.'

Forlorn: It has taken more than six months and £250,000 to secure Julia and Tango (seen here before his rescue), but his new owners said it has been worth the expense . Tango was one of several tigers who starred in TV adverts for Esso - whose slogan was 'Put a tiger in your tank' - in the 1990s. He later went to the circus in Germany, where he and Julia were mistreated. The two tigers have arrived at their new home near Langworth, Lincolnshire. Mr Mumby, director of the Woodside, said the pair arrived safely and went straight to bed after their long journey. He said: 'They are doing really well. They've had a long journey and just like us humans, they get tired, so they went straight to bed when they got here.'

Neil Mumby, director of the Woodside, said the pair arrived safely and went straight to bed after their long journey . It has taken more than six months and £250,000 to secure the two tigers, but Mr Mumby said it had been worth the cost. He said: 'There are no other tigers in . Lincolnshire on view to the public. It's great for the people of . Lincolnshire to be able to come and learn about them. 'Tango . is one of the Esso tigers so he's a TV star who has come here to enjoy . his retirement. He would have been one of many tigers to be used in the . adverts.' The Esso (Exxon) brand of petrol was advertised with the tiger slogan between the 1960s and 1990s. Tango (not pictured) was one of several tigers to front ad campaigns like this one for Esso during the 1990s . Fuelling the marketing campaign: Esso also ran this series of magazine adverts in the 2000s . Mr Mumby said: 'After the ads, he went over to the circus in Germany where he is sadly believed to have been mistreated. 'Happily, . he is here with us now and he will be able to enjoy his retirement with . his partner Julia, who is only eight years old. She keeps him young.' The park was contacted six months ago by animal charity Wildlife Re-homing services after it was alerted to the tigers' plight. It had to grapple with cross-border bureaucratic wrangling, working with the animal import laws of three countries. Woodside Wildlife and Falconry Park in Lincolnshire was contacted six months ago by animal charity Wildlife Re-homing services after it was alerted to the tigers' plight . New home: The tiger enclosure at Woodside Wildlife and Falconry Park . The big cats' arrival was further delayed by industrial action by French staff at Calais, Mr Mumby said. 'The paperwork has been a nightmare,' he said. 'These tigers were supposed to be coming a few days ago. 'We've got the Belgian government, the French government and the British Government all involved. 'Trying to get all of the government departments to talk to each other can sometimes cause hiccups.' The animals are now on display to the public at the park. They were being held in the indoor section of a new enclosure built for the big cats for a day, before being allowed into the open-air section. A spokesman for Esso told MailOnline: 'Tigers have not featured in our advertising in this country for many years, but back in the 1990s a number of different tigers appeared as cubs following two days filming and a one day photographic session.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Many favourite first names from just a century ago are at risk of dying out or are already extinct, new research reveals. Extinct names - those that were among the most popular in 1905, but are no longer chosen - include Gertrude, Bertha and Blodwen for girls plus Willie, Cecil and Rowland for boys. Names classified as 'endangered' include Horace, Leslie and Norman for boys and Doris, Hilda and Edna for girls. Names classified as 'endangered' include Doris, Hilda and Edna for girls and Horace, Leslie and Norman for boys. It means the names are at risk of dying out but are currently still in use, including by Actress and singer Doris Day, left, and former shamed Eastenders star Leslie Grantham, right . Extinct names - those that were among the most popular in 1905, but are no longer chosen - include Willie, Cecil and Rowland for boys. 'Roland' is used by Tears for Fears frontman Roland Orzabal, left, while Edna - which is classed as 'endangered' is famed by Dame Edna Everage aka Barry Humphries, right . Researchers analysed millions of birth records from 1905 to the present day. Names classified as 'extinct' were those that were in the top 100 in 1905 but not present in the 2012 lists. 'Endangered' names were those that had fallen in prevalence by 99 per cent, while 'at risk' names were those that had fallen by 98 per cent. The study, by family history website Ancestry.co.uk, showed names in the 'at risk' category - those still being chosen, but significantly less common than they used to be - include Cyril, Arnold and Bernard for boys, plus Mildred, Dorothy and Lilian for girls. Many popular names from the early 20th Century have also evolved to their shorter form, which has replaced their previous name in popularity. Termed the ‘Alfie effect’, this trend has seen Freddie replace Frederick, Archie overtake Archibald and Charlie become far more popular now than Charles. The same applies to girls’ names, with Lexi replacing Alexandra, Sophia making way for Sophie and Ellie overtaking Eleanor. Names in the 'at risk' category - those still being chosen, but significantly less common than they used to be - include Arnold, like that of Arnold Schwarzenegger, right, and Trevor, famed by inventor Trevor Bayliss, left . The analysis also showed far more girls’ names disappearing or ‘at risk’ than boys - thought to be because many mens' names are passed on from father to son, whereas mothers’ names are more likely to be selected as middle names, rather than forenames, for daughters. However, many of the most popular . names of 1905 remain common today, driven by the fact that one in three . parents (34 per cent) choose their child’s name to commemorate an . ancestor. Such names include Lily, Hannah and Lydia for girls and Alan, Patrick and Joe for boys. And . a number of names have surged in popularity or become fashionable . recently, overtaking the level of popularity seen in the early 1900s. Many of the most popular names of 1905 remain common today, including Lilly - possibly thanks to pop star Lilly Allen, right - and Patrick - like that of Hollywood hunk Patrick Dempsey, left . Oliver, Charlie and Jacob fall into this category, as do Amelia, Grace and Isabella. Miriam Silverman, Ancestry’s UK content manager, said: 'Of course, no first name can truly become extinct, as it can easily be resurrected, but it’s fascinating to look at the list from 1905 and see which have thrived and which have faded into obscurity. 'We also know that people appreciate a rare or unusual name in their family tree and as more people join the family history revolution we believe that such endangered names will be protected by concerned descendants.' Harry is a traditional name which has boomed over recent years and topped many 'top 10 boys' names' lists, perhaps thanks to Prince Harry, pictured . ‘Extinct’ - (None recorded in latest birth records): .

"By . Jill Reilly . and Victoria Allen . They have been a bleak part of the Glasgow skyline for half a century. But as part of the Commonwealth Games £10million opening ceremony, five of the city’s tower blocks will be demolished. As organisers yesterday proudly unveiled their plan, it was slammed as ‘crass and insensitive’ and ‘a  spectacle on the cheap’. The 15-second stunt to be screened around the world stands in stark contrast to the triumphant opening to the London Olympics in 2012. Five tower blocks which have been part of Glasgow's skyline for almost 50 years will be blown up as part of the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony . Six of the original eight tower blocks remain after two earlier demolitions, one in 2012 and one last year (pictured) Conservative . Glasgow councillor David Meikle, whose mother grew up in the flats, . said: ‘There has been no consultation about this, it is a few cultural . bureaucrats thinking this sounds like an arty idea, but it is a very odd . decision. ‘People watching . in developing countries with substandard housing will not understand why . these high-rise buildings are being blown up. ‘This is not the positive vision of Glasgow we should be portraying.’ Sir . Menzies Campbell, former Liberal Democrats leader and ex  Commonwealth . Games athlete, whose father oversaw construction of the flats, said: ‘It . seems a really curious way to celebrate.’ Alison Irvine, author of a book based on the flats’ residents added: ‘It is crass and insensitive in the extreme. ‘It’s ignoring the thousands of people who had lived their lives there and their memories of the place.’ The sixth tower, currently occupied by asylum seekers, will be demolished by 2017. London Olympics opened with The Queen and James Bond parachuting into the Olympic Stadium - now bosses of Glasgow Commonwealth Games plan own explosive opening by blowing up five tower blocks . The London 2012 Olympic Games began with a bang as billions tuned into the spectacular Opening Ceremony . A performance at the stat of the London 2012 games which saw hundreds of dancers take to the stage . The summer’s explosions will create 50,000 tons of twisted steel and rubble which will take years to be cleared away. A Glasgow 2014 spokesman described the event as a ‘bold and dramatic statement of intent from a city focused on regeneration’. But . organisers admit that if there are safety issues, the demolition will . be cancelled depriving the Games of its opening ceremony showpiece on . July 23. The blocks’ final . few moments will be beamed live into the ceremony at Celtic Park on a . giant 100-metre screen, as well as to an estimated TV audience of more . than one billion people around the world. Almost 900 homes near the site will . be temporarily evacuated during the event and their residents invited to . join in the opening celebrations at local venues. Eileen . Gallagher, independent director on the Glasgow 2014 board and chair of . the ceremonies, culture and Queen’s baton relay committee, said: 'By . sharing the final moments of the Red Road flats with the world as part . of the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games, Glasgow is proving it . is a city that is proud of its history but doesn’t stand still. Residents from the flats where three asylum seekers died in June 2010 in a triple suicide march in support of asylum seekers (file photo) 'A city that is constantly regenerating, renewing and re-inventing itself. 'Glasgow’s . story is always one of its people; their tenacity, their genuine . warmth, their ambitions. Marking the end of Red Road is very much a . celebration of all of those things.' When they were built between 1964 and 1969, the Red Road flats were the highest in Europe at 292ft (89 metres). They . were designed to accommodate 4,700 people, but lately far fewer people . remain there after decades of the properties slipping into decline. Red . Road resident Ali Mudassir, 21, said the tower blocks have been like . family to him since he moved to Glasgow three years ago. The student said: 'They have been a family to me, that's how I would describe it. 'It's . been a great experience and they will be missed. The area will be . entirely different after they've gone. But they have been here for 60 . years or something and it was time to get them demolished anyway.' When they were built between 1964 and 1969, the Red Road flats were the highest in Europe at 292ft (89 metres) The Red Road flats have housed many . asylum seekers over the years and the community was horrified by the . deaths of a Russian family who jumped from their block in March 2010. Serguei . Serykh, 43, his wife Tatiana, and his 19-year-old stepson Stepan had . apparently had their application to remain in the UK refused. Campaigner . Robina Qureshi said: 'For the Olympic games, they light a torch, and . here in Glasgow, they are celebrating the start of the Commonwealth . Games by blowing up the Red Road flats. 'It's . highly insensitive and jars with the senses. Many of the sportsmen and . women in the Commonwealth games from other countries may well be . claiming asylum here, as so often happens, because of the threat of . torture or denial of certain freedoms over there in their own countries. 'The . Commonwealth committee clearly thinks it's a great idea to blow it up . but clearly has no concept of the misery the Red Road flats caused to . thousands of people from Glasgow and across the world. No change there . then.' The director of Positive Action in Housing said the Red Road flats were a 'place of despair' and should never have been built. Demolition of the five skyscrapers will be part of the curtain raiser to the largest sporting and cultural event Scotland has ever h . Games . organisers believe the live blow-down will 'serve as an unforgettable . statement of how Glasgow is confidently embracing the future and . changing for the better', while being a 'respectful recognition and . celebration of the role the Red Road flats have played in shaping the . lives of thousands of city families' who lived there. In 2006, director Andrea Arnold used the flats as the setting for her Scottish Bafta-winning film Red Road. And . in 2007 tightrope walker Didier Pasquette attempted to walk ninety . metres above the ground on a thin metal wire stretching between three of . the tower blocks, although due to unpredictable winds he was not able . to complete the walk. City council leader Gordon Matheson has written about the plans to each affected household.

He . said: 'The opening ceremony will be the moment when we welcome the . world to Glasgow. It will be a ceremony like no other, showcasing our . city’s unique style and personality and with our people and communities . at its very heart. We are going to wow the world, with the demolition of . the Red Road flats set to play a starring role. 'Red . Road has an iconic place in Glasgow’s history, having been home to . thousands of families and dominating the city’s skyline for decades. Their demolition will all but mark the end of high-rise living in the . area and is symbolic of the changing face of Glasgow, not least in terms . of our preparations for the Games.' David Zolkwer, head of ceremonies and artistic director for Glasgow 2014, said: 'Over the course of just a few seconds the city’s skyline will be transformed forever. 'It’s a bold and confident statement that says ‘bring on the future’, but it will also be an important opportunity for us to contemplate the many lives lived in the tower blocks over the last 50 years.' Scotland’s Commonwealth Games Minister Shona Robison said: 'For many people, these Games are more than sport, they are a chance for regeneration, renewal and having better places to live and work.'. It was once the gleaming future of modern city living. Now the Red Road estate is a dumping ground for asylum seekers. Glasgow's Red Road housing estate epitomises the failed council housing policies of the 1960s which saw communities torn apart and moved into huge, impersonal tower blocks. Glaswegian comedian Billy Connolly compared  the peripheral estates to 'deserts with windows'. When they were built between 1964 and 1969, the steel-framed buildings - some up to 31 storeys high - contained 4,700 people and were the tallest residential blocks in Europe. Council tenants in Glasgow's notorious tenement slums swarmed on to waiting lists to move into the spacious new flats on the estate. But the rot soon set in. The first lifts failed in the 1970s. Then the graffiti artists arrived. The 1980s brought chronic drug dependency and spiralling crime. Glasgow City Council handed two blocks with the worst reputation to the YMCA as part of an effort to improve the area. In 2005 Glasgow Housing Association announced its intention to demolish one of the tallest blocks as part of a regeneration plan for the area. Regeneration is well underway with new housing developments and the demolition process of the flats ongoing. Six of the original eight tower blocks remain after two earlier demolitions, one in 2012 and one last year. One block, Petershill Court, is currently used to house asylum seekers and will come down at a later date.","Flats blown up in just 15 seconds using more than 1,250kg of explosives .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Vince Cable today refused to apologise for his handling of the Royal Mail privatisation, despite mounting criticism that he sold it off on the cheap. The Business Secretary said apologising was the 'last thing' he intended to do, and insisted the government has achieved its 'key objectives' in floating the firm for £3.5billion . But Labour said it has been a 'first class disaster' that has seen taxpayers 'short changed' out of hundreds of millions. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable refused to apologise for his handling of the Royal Mail sell-off . In a damning report today the National Audit Office claimed the taxpayer got a raw deal from the sell-off. The Government’s spending watchdog . said the controversial privatisation was ‘marked by deep caution, the . price of which was borne by the taxpayer’. In . October, the Royal Mail was floated on the stock market at a price of . £3.3billion. Today it is worth £5.6billion – a gap of £2.3billion. On . the first day of trading, about £750million ‘flowed to the new . shareholders’ – mainly City investors who benefited from an instant 38 . per cent share price rise. The NAO concludes: ‘The Department for Business could have achieved better value for the taxpayer.' Rise: Royal Mail is now worth £5.6billion - £2.3billion more than its initial value . Mr Cable was called to the Commons to answer an urgent question on the sell-off, where he faced calls to admit he was wrong. But . the Lib Dem minister told MPs: 'The last thing I intend to do is . apologise. What I do intend to do is to refer to what the report . actually said as opposed to the spinning and the froth that is being . generated around me.' He . said the Government had achieved its key objectives by delivering short . and long-term benefits, including £2 billion from the sale, 690,000 . shares owned by the public, and the largest employee share scheme in . more than 30 years. In the long term, he said the 'ongoing risk to the taxpayer' had been reduced by the privatisation. But . Chuka Umunna, Labour's shadow business secretary, said: 'You know it's . April Fool's Day when a report is published by the National Audit Office . saying 'the department could have achieved better value for the . taxpayer' and then ministers go out on to the media and then come to . this House and then declare their privatisation a success. Last night Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, accused the Department for Business of having ‘had no clue what it was doing’. Describing the sale as a ‘second-class performance’, she said: ‘It is clear to me the Department for Business under-sold the taxpayer when it privatised Royal Mail.’ But Business Minister Michael Fallon dismissed the criticism, saying: ‘Hindsight is a wonderful thing.’ He . added: ‘We were cautious to avoid the risk of this transaction falling . over. If we had put it on the market at a much higher price, we would . have been left with a fatally damaged Royal Mail.’ Today’s NAO report says the Government met its ‘primary objective’ of selling the postal giant before the election in May 2015. But it also lays bare the extent to . which the City hit the jackpot from the sale – and damningly concludes . the Government should cut its reliance on City advisers before any . future flotations. When the . shares went on the market, private investors were allowed to buy a . maximum of £750 worth, but an exclusive group of 16 of the City’s . biggest names were given ‘priority’ status and allowed to buy up to . £46million worth each. Criticism: Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, accused Government of having 'no clue what it was doing' but Business Minister Michael Fallon said: 'Hindsight is a wonderful thing' When the Royal Mail floated . last year, Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was looking for . long-term stability from ‘the right kind of investor community’. As . a result, 16 of the City’s investment giants were singled out from the . 796 which wanted to buy shares and given favoured status. This . group was awarded a much larger tranche of shares – about £46million . worth each – while 506 received nothing and the rest between £600,000 . and £6million worth. But . few of the ‘priority’ investors – believed to include Legal & . General, Threadneedle, BlackRock, and Fidelity – have been as long-term . in their approach as Mr Cable had hoped. The NAO said: ‘Almost half of the shares allocated to them had been sold within weeks.’ In one example, Standard Life bought nearly 12million shares in October, but now owns just 118,480. Speaking to MPs in October, Business Secretary Vince Cable justified the arrangement by saying he wanted to attract ‘the right kind of investor community’, which was about ‘long-termism’. But today’s report reveals many of the ‘priority’ investors then rushed to sell their shares, making themselves a fortune as the share price rocketed from £3.30 to more than £6. Of the 16, six had sold 100 per cent of their shares ‘within the first few weeks of trading’, according to the NAO. Yesterday Mr Cable insisted: ‘Achieving the highest price possible at any cost and whatever the risk was never the aim of the sale. ‘The report concludes there was a real risk of a failed sale attached to pushing the price too high.’ Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said the Department for Business had been ‘very keen’ to sell Royal Mail in order to prevent the company becoming a burden on the taxpayer. But he added: ‘Its approach, however, was marked by deep caution, the price of which was borne by the taxpayer.’ In order to sell the business, the NAO said Royal Mail’s £8.6billion pension black hole had also been given to the taxpayer. While it has received £28.8billion of assets from the pension fund, it has also been left with £37.4billion of liabilities, which are the pension promises made to Royal Mail’s workers. Last year, it emerged that UBS, one of the banks which ran the sale on behalf of the Government, had considered increasing the price at which the shares would be offered from £3.30 to £3.50 just days before the flotation. But it then decided the move was too risky, and warned  Mr Cable against increasing the share price – advice which he followed. William Rucker, chief executive of Lazard, the investment bank which advised the Government on the sale, insisted it was the ‘maximum price achievable’ at the time. Mr Rucker said: ‘There was no clear ability to go above £3.30 at that particular time.’ Last night, Royal Mail shares were worth £5.63 each.","Postal service was floated on stock market in October, valued at £3.3bn .

"By . Lucy Crossley . and Sara Malm . The 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite could be planning . a retaliation attack after her 'terrorist teacher' was shot dead this . week. Al-Qaeda leader Abubakar . Shariff Ahmed was killed by unidentified gunmen as he and a friend were . walking from a court in Mombasa, Kenya to a nearby mosque. Ahmed, also known as Makaburi - meaning graveyard, is said to be the person who recruited Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, to al-Shabaab, an African-centered phalanx of Al-Qaeda. Link: Ahmed had been linked to fugitive terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite, dubbed the White Widow, as he helped more than 100 Britons to join Somali terrorist group al-Shabaab, which counts her as a member . Lewthwaite, a mother-of-four dubbed 'Britain's most wanted woman', is just one of hundreds of Britons, including Lee Rigby's killer Michael Adebolajo, allegedly recruited by Ahmed. Security services now fear that Lewthwaite is planning revenge over the death of the al-Shaabab head, and will attack Western-affiliated targets in Africa as she blames the Kenyan government for the death of Ahmed. 'Intelligence suggests Makaburi introduced Samantha Lewthwaite to many influential figures within the al-Shabaab network – he guided her path to Jihad,' a senior security source told the Mirror. 'This will be seen as yet another act of war and could spectacularly backfire on the Kenyan government if they are found to be responsible for his death. 'Lewthwaite and her associates will want revenge.' Killed: Al-Qaeda leader Abubakar Shariff Ahmed, who is suspected of recruiting White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite has been shot dead in Kenya . Wanted: The 29-year-old British Muslim convert is the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, and three others with links to al-Shabaab . A witness said that two gunmen had opened fire, with around 20 shots fired as Ahmed, fell to the floor, dressed in a white checked robe. His companion was also shot dead. The witness said that police arrived soon afterwards, and slid the preacher's body into the back of an official pick up truck. Human rights activists' have claimed that the . Kenyan government — rattled by the presence of Islamic extremists in Kenya and . by the attack last year by al-Shabab on a Nairobi mall — was  behind the . killing, and were also responsible for the deaths of two other Muslim leaders. Ahmed . had been linked to fugitive terror suspect Lewthwaite, dubbed the White . Widow, as he helped more than 100 Britons to join Somali terrorist . group al-Shabaab, which counts her as a member. The 29-year-old British Muslim convert is . the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering . the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, . and three others with links to al-Shabaab. However, in September last year Ahmed denied ever having met Lewthwaite, who is the widow of of 7/7 bomber . Germaine Lindsay. Ahmed was also linked to another British fanatic, Jermaine Grant, who is currently on trial over a plot to bomb hotels. A UN investigation has suggested that Ahmed and Grant took over the Kenyan and East African leadership of Al-Qaeda in 2012. Worry: In October Ahmed told how he was 'living on borrowed time' after two other other Muslim leaders of a mosque that Makaburi was associated with were killed by unidentified gunmen in Mombasa. Outspoken: In February Ahmed was pictured arguing with senior police officers outside the Masjid Musa Mosque in Mombasa, Kenya . In October Ahmed told how he was 'living on borrowed time' after two other other Muslim leaders of a mosque that Makaburi was associated with were killed by unidentified gunmen in Mombasa. When he was interviewed in October, Ahmed, who was seated under a cloth bearing a hand-painted sword and religious text in Arabic, railed against the killings of radical . Muslim leaders, saying that while Kenyan security forces might think . that killing them helps snuff out radical Islam, it actually increases . the problem. 'Mombasa youths are looking for guns. It was nothing, then knives, and now it's guns,' he said. He . added that whoever had ordered his two friends killed would also order . his death. Police and the government have denied involvement but have . made no arrests in connection with the shootings. Samantha Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber . Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between . King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations. She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam. The British Muslim . convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 . people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia. Interpol . issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks . for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011. The 29-year-old is . the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering . the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, . and three others with links to al-Shabaab. Yesterday the US Embassy deplored the . recent violence in Kenya, including Makaburi's murder, and called for a . full investigation. The US . has encouraged dialogue between the government and religious leaders 'to . address the underlying causes of tensions and to help counter the . danger presented by violent extremist groups.' On Tuesday evening, just prior to his . death, Ahmed had left a courtroom where he had helped more than two . dozen youths accused of being part of al-Shabaab. Hussien . Khalid, an official with a human rights group in Mombasa called Haki . Africa, said government agents are prime suspects in such killings. He . said 20 Muslims have been killed in the city the last four months. 'We know the government is targeting us now,' he said. 'We know our lives are in danger because we are speaking up against the atrocities they are committing to people at the coast, so they see us as the enemy to their cause, which is fraught with human rights violations.' The US State Department's report on Kenya's human rights record published earlier this year found that Kenyan security forces were responsible for the most serious human rights abuses in 2013, 'including unlawful killings, forced disappearances, torture, and use of excessive force.' Violent attacks have been increasing in Kenya. On Monday three blasts detonated in central Nairobi, killing six people Police said Wednesday they have since arrested 900 people from the Somali enclave of Nairobi. Although described by some as charismatic and intelligent, Ahmed held radical views and notably said that the four al-Shabaab gunmen who slaughtered at least 67 people in Nairobi's Westgate Mall in September 'had every right to do what they did'. 'Islamically it is justified. We cannot allow foreign forces entering Muslim countries, killing innocent Muslim people and then it go unpunished,' he said, citing Kenya's military presence in Somalia and the need for an 'eye for an eye' defense of Muslim life. A July report from the UN Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea accused Ahmed of maintaining ties to a Kenyan terror group known as al-Hijra and said he wanted terrorist attacks to be deadlier. Speaking in October, Ahmed said he was bound by the Quran to avenge the killings of his two friends, Sheik Aboud Rogo and Sheik Ibrahim Ismael. 'We will kill the people who killed them,' he said. He argued that Muslims in Kenya have no other recourse. 'There is no law here. We are in the jungle,' he said. 'We cannot see our fellow Muslims being slaughtered in front of their children and wives and not do anything. We are the ones being terrorised here.'

"By . Tim Shipman . Communication: The Labour leader has been told he needs to use more 'direct language' to win over voters . Ed Miliband needs to use more ‘direct language’ to win over voters, one of his closest frontbench allies has said. Labour’s deputy chairman Jon Trickett said his leader needs to communicate in ‘primary colours’ and reflect the way voters talk if the party is to win the general election. He is the latest in a long line of Labour figures to call for Mr Miliband to speak more clearly. A growing number of Labour MPs are concerned that his sometimes ponderous professorial prognostications about political abstractions are proving a turn-off for the public - concerns that have grown as Labour’s poll lead has shrunk. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Mr Trickett said the party needed to ‘communicate in the most direct language we possibly can and in primary colours’. He added: ‘Strong, plain language, in primary colours, is part of a spectrum of communication techniques which any modern party [has to] use.’ ‘Labour needs to speak with all the accents and dialects and different rhythms of speech which the English and the British speak with.’ Mr Trickett, a shadow minister without portfolio - a post designed to leave him free to act as an attack dog -- praised Mr Miliband for promoting frontbenchers with regional accents. ‘That is what Ed is assembling together, whether it is Michael Dugher or Gloria [De Piero] or Douglas [Alexander]. Each speaks in a different accent in a different way.’ But he made clear there is also an onus on Mr Miliband to make himself more clearly understood. Mr Trickett said: ‘It is up to his whole team, including me, that we get out more often and make the case for big change, radical transformation and a reconnection with those people who left Labour.. prior to 2010.’ He spoke out after former Cabinet minister Hazel Blears said Mr Miliband had to start ‘talking in normal human language’. Backbencher Simon Danczuk has twice gone . public to rail against Mr Miliband’s speaking style and his keenness in . speeches on political theory and non-specfic slogans. Advice: Labour's deputy chairman Jon Trickett said his leader needs to communicate in 'primary colours' ‘Our communication has to be much stronger,’ Mr Danczuk argued. ‘I think we have to move beyond abstract concepts like “one nation”.’ Tory MP Henry Smith said: ‘When your own appointed “attack dog” starts attacking the leadership, you know the Labour party are is complete disarray. ‘Ed Miliband can’t communicate to the hardworking people of Britain because he has no long term plan for the country. He only offers more spending, more borrowing and more taxes, exactly what got us into a mess in the first place.’ Ed Balls used a speech last night to suggest that the UK should stay in the European Union . Mr Trickett appeared to claim that his comments had been taken out of context. Last night he tweeted: ‘Evidently you haven’t bothered to read the details. Typical Tory never let the facts get in the way of an attack line.’ Meanwhile Ed Balls used a speech last night to argue that Britain must stay in the European Union. In a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference, the Shadow Chancellor sought to rebuild links with business leaders who are sceptical of Labour’s economic credentials. Wooing businessmen who want to stay in the EU, he said: ‘We are clear that there is no future for Britain in walking away from our biggest market. ‘We believe Britain is better placed to shape Europe’s future, and back British business, jobs and our national interest, if we are fully engaged rather than having one foot out of the door.’ Mr Balls, who is widely credited with keeping Britain out of the euro when he was Gordon Brown’s adviser, sought to make a virtue of Ed Miliband’s refusal to back an in-out referendum. He said: ‘We would hold an in-out referendum if there was a further transfer of powers - a prospect we believe is possible, but unlikely in the next Parliament. Not an arbitrary timetable for a referendum, which puts Tory party politics before the national economic interest, and is creating huge uncertainty for business. ‘To walk away from our EU membership would be reckless, foolish and deeply damaging. It would be anti-investment, anti-jobs and anti-business.’","Jon Trickett said his leader needs to communicate in ‘primary colours’

"By . Dan Bloom . Accused: A maths teacher told Michael Piggin, pictured, that he may end up in prison . A maths teacher 'took the Mickey' out of a teenage neo-Nazi by telling him he would 'end up in prison or killing a bunch of people', a court heard. Michael Piggin was just 16 when he is accused of drawing up plans for a massacre at his former school in Loughborough, Leicestershire, inside a swastika-adorned Che Guevara notebook. But in police interviews aired at the Old Bailey - where Piggin is charged with plotting terrorism - the English Defence League supporter said the notebook was simply an outlet for his anger. He added he had been angry when the teacher challenged him on his extreme views. Speaking to police, he said: '[The maths teacher] would say I am probably going to end up in prison or killing a bunch of people. ‘You wouldn’t expect a teacher to take the Mickey out of someone in front of the class. ‘It did annoy me.’ He had named his maths teacher on a so-called ‘hitlist’ and wrote about shooting him dead. But Piggin told police: ‘I wouldn’t say I actually wanted to kill him. ‘I might have at the time I wrote it.’ He added: ‘If I did want to hurt him, I wouldn’t have written about it, I would have just done it. ‘I’m not that kind of person, that’s why I wrote it.’ Piggin idolised English Defence League . founder Tommy Robinson and mass murderers, including the Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik, the trial has heard.

Flames: The Old Bailey saw him launch the homemade explosive, which was put together using a wine bottle . But Piggin, now 18, told police the plans in his notebook would never have been carried out. ‘I can control myself 99.9 per cent of the time’, he told the officer. ‘I was writing it in the notebook so I wouldn’t end up hurting anyone by carrying out acts of violence against them. ‘I think I see it as me being able to control the situation by writing.’ Piggin added later: ‘I wasn’t going to go that far - it was just writing. ‘It was never enough generally, that’s why I wrote it, to clear the anger.’ Organisation: The accused teenager is said to have plotted a Columbine-style massacre in Loughborough . Graffiti: More footage showed the defendant allegedly spraying 'No more mosques' on the wall . In his notebook, which was also adorned with Nazi slogans, Piggin drew up a detailed plan for the alleged assault.

"By . Martin Robinson . Three couples who married on the same day, in the same church, have together celebrated 180 years of marriage in what could be Britain's only combined triple diamond wedding anniversary. The trio of blushing brides and grooms had never met before they tied the knot in turn on March 30, 1964 but have remained life-long friends ever since. Stewart and Mary Chugg, both 70, Frank and Sandra Smale, also 70, and Patrick Parsley, 71, and wife Eileen, 69, went down the aisle within hours of one another. Still in together after all these years: Stewart and Mary Chugg, Frank and Sandra Smale and Patrick and Eileen Parsley (left to right) became lifelong friends after marrying on the same day at the same church fifty years ago . The three couples remained friends and still live in the same town and their marriages endured - and they all met up last week to mark their six decades of marital bliss. Mrs Smale said: 'We just feel blessed we are still here and able to celebrate. 'I would imagine it is quite unusual for three couples to be celebrating 50 years together, and it is quite a milestone.' All six were born and raised in the pretty North Devon town of Barnstaple. Their . wedding venue, tiny St Mary's Church, has long since been demolished . but the three marriages are all rock solid after 50 years. Their . back-to back nuptials happened partly by chance because the frugal . lovebirds wanted to take advantage of a tax break for married couples. With . the financial perk due to run out on April 1 they were forced to book . their weddings for the same day, with an hour's interval between each . service. Special day: Stewart and Mary Chugg, . Frank and Sandra Smale and Patrick and Eileen Parsley, in the same order as above, were all wed at . the now demolished St Mary's in Barnstaple, Devon . 50 years on they are still friends and met for a drink last week  to celebrate their anniversaries. They then held larger celebrations with their own families in the town they love. Eileen Parsley said: 'We met up and talked about old times in Barnstaple. It was lovely. 'It was very nice because we all come from Barnstaple and we are all born and bred here. 'We just feel blessed we are still here and able to celebrate'. The longevity of their marriages is remarkable. In 1964 one in 12 ended in divorce. Today one in two marriages ends in divorce .","Stewart and Mary Chugg, Frank .

"By . James Chapman . Universities would have to apply new aptitude tests and cut the number of drop-outs in plans for a shake-up of the student loans system. Amid concerns about the long-term viability of the funding system for higher education, senior Conservatives are considering reforms that would reduce its cost and crack down on poor quality degrees. They include a new minimum qualification for students who qualify for taxpayer-backed loans and an end to the right to charge fees at institutions which see large numbers of students fail to finish courses or find well-paid jobs. Future: New plans include an end to the right to charge fees at institutions which see large numbers of students fail to finish courses or find well-paid jobs . Chancellor George Osborne has announced that the Government is abolish the cap on student numbers in 2015, increasing the cost of taxpayer subsidies to the sector by around £700 million a year. ‘With George Osborne announcing no controls on student numbers, there are fantastic opportunities. Wanting your kid to go to university is an aspiration to join the middle class,’ said a Government source. ‘The graduate repayment scheme is a perfectly solid way of financing graduate education. However, we may need some kind of quality control, because universities will be able to recruit without the old framework on number controls. So there’s a legitimate question about what would happen if a university was signing up lots of people who couldn’t get through a course and were then dropping out.’ Under the tuition fees regime brought in by the coalition, universities can charge fees of up to £9,000 a year. Students start paying back loans which cover them once they are earning over £21,000 at a rate of nine per cent of their salary above £15,000. Any debt still owing after 30 years is automatically cancelled by the government. Paul Kirby, David Cameron’s former policy chief, who is now at KPMG, has drawn up detailed plans for reform. Plans: Universities would have to apply new aptitude tests and cut the number of drop-outs in plans for a shake-up of the student loans system . He said there were too many ‘sub-prime loans’ being made to students doing courses with ‘unsatisfactory completion rates, [which] offer limited chances of graduate level employment and cost students more than they gain financially’. He said that when the new loans system was brought in, the Government estimated that 35 per cent of money lent would not be repaid. But recently, the National Audit Office has suggested this is likely to be at least 50 per cent. Forecasts suggest there will be more graduates on low to modest salaries, who will not start paying anything back, while the Student Loan Company is struggling to get payments from those freelancing or in short-term jobs, as well as from EU students overseas. ‘On top of this level of non-payment, there are substantial subsidies for the poorest students who receive maintenance grants and for higher cost courses,’ Mr Kirby said. ‘All in all, it means that the taxpayer will be paying more for university education than it did before the loans were introduced. Limit: Chancellor George Osborne has announced that the Government is abolish the cap on student numbers in 2015, increasing the cost of taxpayer subsidies to the sector by around £700 million a year . In these terms, it is hard to believe how much political capital has been spent on the loans controversy. Armed with these facts, I suspect that political history will label the introduction of student loans as one of the presentational failures of the century.’ He said ‘lines in the sand’ now needed to be drawn about which universities should be attended and which courses followed ‘to protect students and taxpayers from wasting time, effort and money’. ‘One way of doing this would be to say that universities will only be accredited for student loans if they achieve a range of minimum standards,’ he added. He suggested that a maximum drop-out rate of 20 per cent, disqualifying 20 out of 121 UK universities, and a requirement that 60 per cent of students should get a professional or graduate level job, a test failed by a third of universities. He also proposed a new entry qualification of 300 Ucas points - or three Bs at A-level - and an expectation that 60 per cent of students should end up with a first class or a 2:1 degree. The Government source said a ‘three Bs’ requirement would exclude people who left school early and wanted to attend university as a mature student, meaning an ‘aptitude test’ was more likely. ‘This is the start of manifesto work. We will look with interest at what Paul Kirby says,’ the source added. ‘The forecasts on repayments are incredibly sensitive to earnings forecasts and they are going to keep on bouncing around.’ Concern: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned Labour's proposals to cut tuition fees to £6,000 a year would favour wealthy students rather than the less well-off . The source said a small increase in the £9,000-a-year tuition fee charge was also possible, adding: ‘We have been freezing it in cash terms. That isn’t a long-term viable option, but that doesn’t mean some great big increase.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned Labour’s proposals to cut tuition fees to £6,000 a year would favour wealthy students rather than the less well-off. Mr Clegg said: ‘When they first announced this it was shown by independent commentators that a £6,000 limit would benefit the very richest students who could pay upfront and would not help at all the very poorest.’ Tories say a £6,000 a year cap on fees would mean a £3 billion-a-year black hole in university funding and point out students repay significantly less every month than they did under the last Government’s loans regime.","Includes minimum qualification for students with taxpayer-backed loans .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ministers say they are 'minded' to go ahead with plain packaging for cigarettes . The government has cleared the way to for cigarettes to be sold in plain packs, despite an outcry from Tory MPs about the ‘nanny state’. Health minister Jane Ellison said she is ‘minded’ to ban branded packs after an official study found it would lead to a ‘modest but important reduction’ in smoking rates. But in the Commons she faced stiff criticism from Conservatives, who claimed the next step would be to force alcohol to be sold in brown paper bags. The government has been bitterly divided over the issue of cigarette packaging and its impact on persuading people to give up smoking. Last year David Cameron was accused of caving in to big tobacco after the idea was shelved to allow the Tories to focus on winning votes based on the economy and welfare. But health ministers were furious, and commissioned a review by Sir Cyril Chantler, a former smoker, which today said putting cigarettes in drab and unattractive packaging would contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of smoking. Smoking groups claime that stripping cigarette packets of branding would lead to an increase in the illicit trade of tobacco products and job losses. Miss Ellison said: ‘Smoking kills nearly 80,000 people each year in England alone and our cancer outcomes stubbornly lag behind much of Europe. ‘Quite apart from the enormous pressure this creates on the NHS, it is a cruel waste of human potential. ‘Yet we know that the vast majority of smokers want to quit and even more tragically we also know that two-thirds of smokers become addicted before they are 18. As a nation therefore we should consider every effective measure we can to stop children taking up smoking in the first place. She added that wanted to move forward as swiftly as possible, explaining: ‘I am currently minded to proceed with introducing regulations to provide for standardised packaging.’ But the move was repeatedly criticised in the Commons by Tory MPs. Robert Halfon said: ‘The logical extension of what she is proposing is that we put brown paper bags over all alcohol. ‘Conservatives believe in freedom and the best way to stop smoking is through education, not by banning things.’ A study by Sir Cyril Chantler found banning branded packets would have a modest but important impact on reducing smoking . Sir Gerald Howarth said: ‘I do not believe that this is a Conservative measure, it is an example of the nanny state.’ Bury North MP David Nuttall said: ‘One unintended consequence of hiding cigarettes behind shutters and putting them in standardised packaging may only increase the desire of inquisitive children to take up smoking.’ However, health campaigners hailed the review into standardised cigarette packaging as a ‘significant step’ towards its introduction. Cancer Research UK's chief executive Harpal Kumar said: ‘This should happen as quickly as possible. We have the evidence and the overwhelming support of parliament, the health community and the public. No more time should be wasted.’ Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), said: ‘Sir Cyril Chantler has quite rightly concluded that there is a strong public health case for standardised packaging of cigarettes and tobacco packaging, and that the tobacco industry's arguments against the policy are spurious.’ Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, added: ‘We now look to the Government to take heed of Sir Cyril's review and ensure that legislation on 'plain' standardised packaging is implemented at the soonest possible opportunity.’ Pro-smoking groups and tobacco companies criticised the review. Daniel Torras, managing director of Japan Tobacco International said: 'Nothing has changed since last summer when the Prime Minister said ""there isn't yet sufficient evidence for it and there is considerable legal uncertainty about it”. 'The Chantler report expilcitly references the ""limitations"" of the evidence presented by a small group of tobacco control lobbyists.'","Health minister Jane Ellison says she is 'minded' to impose a ban .

"By . Andrew Chesterton . Salma Parveen's husband strangled her to death with a scarf after she told him their marriage was over . A spurned husband who murdered his wife by strangling her with a scarf after she told him their marriage was over has been jailed for life. Muhammed Hussain Iqbal, 29, killed Salma Parveen, 22, in the bedroom of their marital home after she announced that she was leaving him. Iqbal took Salma, a bank clerk, by surprise and killed her by wrapping a scarf around her neck as she was getting read for work on April 29 last year. After throttling her to death he then . bound her hands and feet with more scarves and hid her body in their . house in Coventry before fleeing on a train for London. He then handed himself in to police a day later where he admitted: 'I come from Coventry where I’ve committed a murder.' Despite confessing to killing Salma in police interviews, Iqbal pleaded not guilty to one count of murder. But he was found guilty by a jury of four men and eight women after a three-week trial at Stafford Crown Court. He was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years behind bars. Sergeant Mick Griffiths, from West Midlands Police, said after the case: 'Throughout this trial Iqbal claimed that he didn’t intend to kill Salma and that he had suffered a loss of control due to provocation. 'He has changed his defence and alleged in court that Salma attacked him with a knife. 'This was pure fabrication and the jury saw through these lies. 'Their relationship had broken down and Salma wanted him to leave the family home. 'Iqbal chose his moment carefully and then struck. Salma had no chance to defend herself and he killed her in a fit of temper.' Muhammed Iqbal, who was today handed a life sentence for the murder of his wife, had fled to London from the couple's Coventry home before handing himself in to police . The court heard the couple married in an Islamic ceremony in 2012 but to secure Iqbal’s visa - which expired this year - he wanted to tie the knot in a civil ceremony. The jury were told Salma was murdered within hours of Iqbal allegedly seeing her kissing another man. He became enraged when he found out . Salma - who had been having an affair with a city councillor for over . three years - had cancelled the wedding just weeks before her death . Married Coventry councillor has  Kamran Caan admitted to the court he had an affair with the 22-year-old which started in 2009 or 2010. The Labour representative for Upper Stoke called Salma his 'Cinderella' in text messages but said he said he had no intention of leaving his wife for her. The court heard they had exchanged numerous other messages in the weeks before her death and had arranged to meet on April 30 - the day after she was killed. After sentencing Salma’s family paid tribute to a 'beautiful' daughter. They said: 'Salma was the spark of our family and full of ambitions and dreams waiting to come true. 'Her life has not only been taken away from her, our lifestyle, spark and bonding of the family has also gone with her. 'Salma was the person we could trust with our eyes closed, the person who was always there for us, the person who we all looked up to. 'She was so beautiful and so was her heart. She was full of energy and up for any challenge regardless of how difficult it was.'","Muhammed Hussain Iqbal killed his wife after she said she was leaving him .

"By . Tara Brady . Eleven members of the same family who kidnapped and tortured a couple they falsely suspected of murdering a widow have been jailed in what police described as the worst case of vigilantism they have seen. The victims, who have been given new identities and cannot be named for legal reasons, were held against their will and subjected to severe beatings by the group as they attempted to extract confessions for the alleged killing. Judge Stephen Holt told Norwich Crown Court the group had kidnapped and interrogated their victims in 'scenes reminiscent of a Hollywood film'. Violet Chilton, 57, (left) was found guilty of false imprisonment and grievous bodily harm while Thomas Chilton, 29, (right) was found guilty of two counts of kidnap and two of false imprisonment . Police seized camcorder footage of . one of the beatings - which the attackers had hoped to use to force . officers to prosecute the couple for murder. The . attacks happened after 75-year-old Gertrude Frankham - widow of leading . travellers’ rights campaigner Eli Frankham - was found dead in her bed . in Walpole St Andrew, Norfolk, in December 2012. Speaking . after the group was sentenced, Superintendent Dennis Lacey said: . 'Despite there never being any evidence of murder they decided to take . the law into their own hands through violence and intimidation. 'In . 27 years in the police, I have never seen anything like this in terms . of the number of people involved and the seriousness of the assaults.

Prosecutor John Farmer told . the court that the offenders took on different roles with some acting as . interrogators and others as violent enforcers in an attempt to gather . evidence to give to the police. Jesse Frankham . Diane Evans . Wayne Dolan . The pair were individually dragged to . a warehouse and made to sit in a chair as they were surrounded and . beaten in April last year, Mr Farmer said.

Edward Dolan admitted kidnap, two counts of false imprisonment and wounding with intent . The . recording of the 999 call, which was played in court, includes the . woman screaming as she was repeatedly hit in a 'brutal' attack. The male victim was told that if he went to police his family would be killed while he was forced to watch, the trial heard. Both . suffered severe injuries and the woman went into labour and . successfully gave birth soon after being released from hospital. Passing sentence, Judge Holt said some of the family still believe Mrs Frankham was murdered. He added: 'This is a family that believed it was above the law and imposed its own law. 'We can hear on the video pure aggression in your voices. 'The psychological impact of this is impossible to comprehend.'

"By . John Hall . A woman who tortured her 'vulnerable' flatmate to death then posted a message of condolence on his Facebook page has been jailed for just 12 years. Georgina Smith, 22, was part of a three-person gang that beat, stabbed and strangled Scott Blackwood to death before trying to set fire to his body at a flat in Saltcoats, Ayrshire in July last year. She was yesterday sentenced to 12 years in prison after being found guilty of culpable homicide - one month are her co-accused Allan Nicol, 36, and Thomas Moore, 26, were convicted of murdering the 30-year-old and jailed for a minimum of 20 years each. Jailed: Georgina Smith, 22, posted an RIP message on Scott Blackwood's Facebook page just four days after helping to torture the vulnerable man to death . Fake condolence: In the message she posted on Facebook, Georgina Smith called Mr Blackwood her 'best mate' and even vowed to see his killers jailed . Sentencing Smith, judge . Lord McEwan said: 'You have been found guilty by the jury of the . culpable homicide of Scott Blackwood a litany of horrific assaults on . this young man. 'In your evidence you said you loved this him, well each man kills the thing he loves and that is what you have done.' Lord McEwan said that three victim impact . statements from Mr Blackwood’s family revealed that the consequences of his death for them are 'dire to put it mildly.' Mr Blackwood had been relentlessly bullied by the group in the hours before his death, Glasgow High Court was told. The court heard that at one point Smith had threatened to pour a mixture of boiling water and sugar over Mr Blackwood for no apparent reason. Victim: Vulnerable Scott Blackwood was found with 72 separate injuries including chemical burns, 13 stab wounds, three broken ribs, a broken eye socket and cheekbone . Witness Sean Sinclair, 20, told how he went to Nicol’s home on the night of the horror and discovered Mr Blackwood badly beaten. He said Moore stood over him armed with metal pole that was covered in blood. In . a police interview, Mr Sinclair went on: 'Tommy hit Scott with the . bar-bell. Alan started laying into Scott on the side of the legs.' Mr Blackwood (pictured) was dragged from Nicol's house before being killed on his own property . 'Georgie was shouting ‘finish him, finish him’. Georgie just kept egging Tommy on.' The . killers eventually dragged a badly injured Mr Blackwood to his own home . because Nicol was 'panicking' about the blood in his property and . saying 'I don't want him dying in here'. Once Mr Blackwood was in his own home the attack continued, with Smith beating him while Nicol held him upright. Mr Blackwood suffered 72 separate injuries including scalds and chemical burns, 13 stabs wounds and three broken ribs. His eye socket and cheekbones were smashed and he had also been strangled . In her police interview, Smith told police that the attack started when Moore hit Smith on the nose with a metal bar. 'I could hear the sound of bone crunching and Allan was shouting at Scott; 'Lick your blood',' she said. 'Scott was shaking and crying. Tommy . poured a bottle of turps over him and Allan stamped on his face. Part of . his ear was bitten off.' When Mr Blackwood collapsed, his killers took him to the bathroom, tied him to the bath with a dog lead, and poured paint solvent over him. Smith then tried to set Mr Blackwood on fire, but Mr Sinclair said he stopped her 'because it wasn't working'. It is thought the killers may have continued to beat and stab Mr Blackwood after he died, with pathologist Dr Julie McAdam saying his head injuries were like those suffered by car crash victims. Guilty: Smith (left) was convicted of culpable homicide and sentenced to 12 years in prison yesterday. Thomas Moore, 26 (right), and accomplice Allan Nicol, 36, were found guilty of murder and given 20 years in jail . Scene: The gang dragged a badly injured Scott Blackwood to his home on Wheatley Road in Saltcoats, Ayrshire (pictured) where he was murdered . The group then when back to Nicol’s house and washed their blood-stained clothes, with Sinclair saying Moore scream that Mr Blacwood 'f****** deserved it' - something Smith vocally agreed with. Days . later Smith posted a message on Mr Blackwood's Facebook page pretending . to be in mourning, calling him a good mate and saying she had been the . only one there for him. Defence QC Neil Murray, representing . Smith, said that she was a vulnerable young woman who had had a horrific . upbringing and childhood. He told the court: 'Miss Smith continues to deny any involvement in the death of Mr Blackwood'. 'However, . she broke down in tears when asked by a social worker about Mr . Blackwood’s death. And said she knew how the family must feel to an . extent because she has lost someone close to her,' he added.","Georgina Smith, 22, posted message on Scott Blackwood's Facebook page .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A policeman has been caught sipping a drink as he drives his patrol car through London - days after a young driver was given a 'ridiculous' £100 fine for a very similar transgression. The officer was pictured driving through London today holding a takeaway soft drink at the wheel of his Metropolitan Police car. A passer-by took the photograph this afternoon on Fitzroy Street in London as the car was moving slowly through traffic. Thirsty? The officer with the Metropolitan Police was pictured by a passer-by taking a drink as he drove down Fitzroy Street in central London . Scene: The car was photographed moving slowly down the street while its driver took a drink . It comes less than a week after 22-year-old Sophie Vaughan found herself confronted with four officers and a police van after taking a single slurp of her raspberry Slush Puppie. She was fined £100 and given three points on her licence after she was spotted drinking while stationary in South London traffic. Miss Vaughan, from Wallington, South London, said: ‘It’s so petty and ridiculous. It was only a tiny sip. I wasn’t even moving. ‘I’m outraged. And talk about overkill – to have four police officers dealing with such a petty thing is a joke.’ However, after being confronted with their own officer's conduct, the Metropolitan Police have said that Miss Vaughan was actually given the penalty for after driving without her seatbelt while using both hands to eat the Slush Puppie. A spokesman said: 'A female driver was seen driving without a seatbelt and without holding on to the steering wheel. 'She was holding a 'Slush Puppie' in one hand and a straw in the other, using the straw to spoon the ice into her mouth. 'She drove away but subsequently stopped the car in Pound Street and was spoken to by officers before being issued with a fixed penalty notice.' Penalty: Last week 22-year-old Sophie Vaughan, pictured, was given a £100 penalty for sipping a Slush Puppie while stuck in traffic . Driving away: The vehicle can be seen moving further down the street through traffic . And although she was met by the full force of the law for her breach, the pictured officer appears to have taken a different view of the law. Sat Dhoot, 31, an IT engineer who works nearby, saw the officer after reading about Miss Vaughan's fine. He told MailOnline: 'Only a few moments ago I read an article about a driver who was fined £100 by police for taking a single slurp of slush at the wheel of her car. 'To my amazement, I saw this only moments later. It's not OK for us - but they can.' The . law does not specify whether eating or drinking while driving is . illegal, and whether drivers have committed by doing so depends on how . it affected their driving. According . to advice from the RAC, drinking a soft drink while on the road is only . an offence 'if you present a significant danger' and if the police . think 'you are not in proper control of the vehicle'. A . study from Leeds University has shown that drivers consuming drinks at . the wheel went 22 per cent more slowly than average, but were also 18 . per cent more likely to show erratic lane control. Guidelines . published by the CPS do not mention food or drink in relation to . driving without due care and attention - but they mention that any act . which causes a driver to be 'avoidably distracted' could constitute an . offence. This is in . contrast to more specific laws which exist around other potential . distractions such as mobile phones - the use of which attracts an . instant penalty.","The officer was driving in central London when he was seen with the drink .

"By . Sanya Burgess . India’s most beautiful and magnificent jewels have been gathered from across the world and put on display in the Kremlin in Moscow.. More than 300 dazzling pieces of jewellery and jewelled objects, some of which are up to 500 years old, are being brought together for the first time as part of the India: Jewels that Enchanted the World exhibit. The Kremlin, known for its opulence and . gilded interiors, will house the jewels, gems and precious metals - many . of which have never been exhibited before. A stunning clip set with diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds by Van Cleef & Arpels transforms an Indian arm jewel into a turban ornament . Gold upper arm bracelet (left) complete with a ruby and emerald, made in the 1800s; This feminine wedding headdress (right) is made from gold, silver, diamonds and pearls is over 70 cm long . Vibrant: Both the bangle (left) and peacock brooch (right) display the mesmerising colour used in some pieces . The British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum have loaned some of their precious treasures, alongside over 30 other museums, institutions and private collections from around the world. Under the watchful eye of the State Museums of Moscow Kremlin, headed by Dr Elena Gagarina, and the Indo-Russian Jewellery Foundation, founded by diamond and jewellery connoisseur Alex Popov, the exhibit will be presented in The Belfry and the One-Pillar Hall. The jewellery, which is worth an estimated £1.5 million, includes bejewelled dancing peacocks, stunning pieces of gold decorated with flowers made of gems, necklaces made of golden wires, and elaborate crowns and hair jewels fit for gods and goddesses. Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala  was one of Cartier's main clients . The Mughals, who ruled as emperors, loved spectacular pieces such as this  rigid collar-necklaces which is studded with gems and is designed to cascade down the neck . Cartier picked up on the Indian colour scheme in this 1925 platinum necklace which is studded with diamonds, sapphires and emeralds and this 'Tutti Frutti'  bracelet wristwatch (right) also designed by Cartier . This intricate pendant was created in the late 16th century for the Mughals. Truly extravagant, it is made of gold, pearl, rubies, diamonds, emeralds and blue glass . Something different: This grand water vessel (left) doubles as a tobacco bowl and is made of gold. Slightly more understated than other items in the collection, this diamond and gold necklace is still worth a fortune . Some of the oldest and most elaborate pieces date back to the Mughal courts where gold, gems and enamel were designed to reflect the power and culture of the conquering and lavish Mughal dynasty. Turban jewels, emblems of sovereignty, sparkle with table-cut diamonds, while rigid collar-necklaces are studded with gems and cascade down the neck. The genius of Mughal design and craftsmanship are illustrated by armbands set with diamonds, exquisitely enamelled bangles with animal-head terminals and a tiny box, set with 103 exquisitely carved emeralds. One section of the exhibit shows off jewelry from the late 19th and early 20th centuries when India and Europe began to cross cultures and influence one another. Tamil Nadu hair ornament . Bayadere necklace by Chaumet in 1920 . Karnataka hair ornament . A 19th century turban ornament is on loan from a private museum in the USA and is made from gold, diamonds, emeralds, pearl and enamel . Although only 10cm tall, this pendant (left) is made from gold, rubies, diamonds and emeralds and would fetch a good price at auction, while this extravagant pearl and diamond necklace is much more obviously dramatic . Famous brands such as Cartier, Chaumet, Mauboussin, Mellerio and Van Cleef & Arpels all turned to India for precious stones and inspiration. Sapphires, emeralds and rubies carved into flowers and leaves became an integral part of Cartier’s 'Tutti Frutti' style.

"Chancellor George Osborne has denied claims that an Independent Scotland could keep the pound . George Osborne today rubbished claims that Scotland could keep the British pound even if it votes for independence later this year. The Chancellor denied suggestions made in a newspaper report which quoted an unnamed UK government minister as saying that if Scotland voted 'yes' to independence, a currency union would 'eventually' be agreed to ensure mutual economic stability. Scottish nationalists want to share the pound in a currency union with the UK and retain the services of the Bank of England. But the three main UK parties have united to reject that plan. The Guardian newspaper quoted the minister as saying a currency union will eventually be agreed between an independent Scotland and the rest of Britain to ensure economic stability on both sides of the border. 'Of course there would be a currency union,' the minister told the paper. 'You simply cannot imagine Westminster abandoning the people of Scotland. 'Saying no to a currency union is obviously a vital part of the No campaign. But everything would change in the negotiations if there were a Yes vote.' The source also suggested a deal could be struck allowing the UK to retain their nuclear weapons base at Faslane in exchange for allowing Scotland to retain the pound. He added: 'There would be a highly complex set of negotiations after a 'yes' vote, with many moving pieces. 'The UK wants to keep Trident nuclear weapons at Faslane and the Scottish government wants a currency union - you can see the outlines of a deal.' Scottish leader Alex Salmond has . repeatedly insisted that nuclear weapons would be removed from . Faslane on the river Clyde if Scots back independence. Should Scotland be allowed to stay in a currency union with UK if it splits? However Mr Osborne insisted: 'There . will not be a currency union in the event of independence. The only way . to keep the UK pound is to stay in the UK. Walking out of the UK means . walking out of the UK pound. 'A currency union will not work because it would not be in Scotland's interests and would not be in the UK's interests. 'Scotland . would have no control over mortgage rates, and would be binding its . hands on tax and funding for vital public services. 'The Scottish Government are proposing to divorce the rest of the UK but want to keep the joint bank account and credit card. 'The . UK would not put its taxpayers at risk of bailing out a foreign country . and its banks. Parliament wouldn't pass it, and the people wouldn't . accept it. 'Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong.' Pledge: Scottish leader Alex Salmond has repeatedly insisted that nuclear weapons would be removed from their Faslane base on the river Clyde if Scots back independence . Polls show the question of what currency . an independent Scotland would use has been high in Scottish voters' minds ahead of an independence referendum on Sept. 18. Many . north of the border worry about the economic uncertainties a new currency would bring if . they voted to end the 300-year-old union with England. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael . said: 'An anonymous, off the record quote does not change the stark . reality on the currency. 'The . UK Government has listened to the views of the governor of the Bank of . England and the independent advice of the Permanent Secretary to the . Treasury that a currency would be damaging for all the United Kingdom. Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the minister's comments gave a big boost to the Yes campaign . 'That's why a currency union simply will not happen. 'The Scottish Government should remove the uncertainty on the currency by coming forward with a plan B.' The minister's comments were seized on by Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who said they gave a big boost to the Yes campaign. She said: 'This was supposed to be the No campaign's trump card, but as the polls show it has backfired badly - the gap between Yes and No has halved since November, and most Scots simply do not believe the bluff and bluster we had from George Osborne, Ed Balls and Danny Alexander. 'Now that the card has been withdrawn, it gives an even bigger boost to the Yes campaign. And it can only add to the sense of crisis which is engulfing the No campaign. 'The reality is that a currency union is every bit as much in the interests of the rest of the UK as an independent Scotland, and that is why Westminster will agree to one. 'Scotland is the rest of the UK's second biggest trading partner, and not sharing sterling would cost businesses south of the border an extra Â£500 million in transaction costs.' She added: 'The leader of the No campaign, Alistair Darling, said that a shared sterling area between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK is 'desirable' and 'logical' - and now the UK Government appears to have U-turned and actually agrees with that sensible position.' The Scottish Government's White Paper on independence, published last November, says a shared currency is in the 'economic interests' of Scotland and the rest of the UK. Almost half of voters north of the border think that Mr Osborne's pledge to rule out a formal currency union with an independent Scotland is a bluff, according to a poll published this week. A YouGov poll for The Times newspaper suggests 45 per cent of Scots do not believe the Chancellor's threat is real, compared with 40% who think he means what he says.","Newspaper report quotes an unnamed .

After trekking across a two mile long frozen lake, Ron and a few friends descended into the underground chamber and used a red road flare to highlight the ethereal blue of their surroundings. Amazingly, the cavern is over 400 feet deep and at the back of the cave resides a moulon, a hole that leads straight up to the surface and is created by melting water pouring down to floor of the glacier. The intense colours are created by pure ice that is free of air, as the ice absorbs all colours of the light spectrum except for blue, the cave is lit up in a spectacular fashion.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . The entry of a 12th team into Formula One for next season is still under consideration by motor sport's world governing body the FIA. Early in December the FIA announced it was seeking expressions of interest from potential new entrants. Gene Haas, one half of the successful Stewart-Haas Racing team that competes in the NASCAR series, has long been the favourite to be given the slot. Ready to go: Bernie Ecclestone believes the entrant made by NASCAR team owner Gene Haas will be accepted . F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone certainly believes that will be the case as he said: 'I think Haas will be accepted.' Speaking to The Independent, Ecclestone added: 'They have got the money, but it's a question of whether they are going to spend it.' The FIA was due to make a decision by the end of February, but is yet to make any official announcement. The matter remains under consideration, although it is expected it will soon be resolved.

"By . Katy Winter . A mother-of-one lost ten stone and dropped eight dress sizes through being motivated to lose weight by a special ‘hug test’ devised by her ten-year-old daughter. Dental nurse Genese Ackroyd, 37, of Featherstone, West Yorkshire, went from 22st 3lb to 12st and shrunk from size 26 to size ten, measuring her progress by how easily her daughter Amelia could  place her arms around her as she gave her a hug. She said: 'I was losing weight for myself, but also my little girl. I wanted her to be proud of me, and I didn’t want her to feel as if she had a fat mum. Genese, pictured left after her 10st weight loss, and right, before weighing 22st . Genese, pictured before she lost weight weighing 22st, had begun to suffer health consequences due to her size . She credits daughter Amelia with keeping her motivated through her weight loss after they devised a special 'hug test' to measure her progress . 'As I kept reaching my milestones, the moment where Amelia could put her arms around me got closer and closer - it was very exciting for both of us. 'The look on her face each time she realised I had made a bit more progress really helped me to keep going.' Ms Ackroyd started putting on weight rapidly after Amelia, her only child, was born. She said: 'Amelia was my miracle baby. I’d been told I had polycystic ovaries and conceiving would be difficult, so to have her was a dream come true. 'After she was born and as she grew older I put all my attention on her. I made sure she ate properly and was always healthy, but I let myself slip. 'I was fairly lazy and didn’t have a good understanding of nutrition, so I would feed myself ready meals, takeaways and processed food - anything that was easy to grab. 'Amelia was eating healthy meals but because I was working later hours I would eat separately from her later on.' By the time she tipped the scales at 22st, Ms Ackroyd began to wonder whether she was doomed to be an unhealthy mum forever. Genese, pictured in her old skirt, has now shrunk from size 26 to size ten, weighing in at a healthy 12st . She said: 'I wanted to lose weight but there were psychological barriers in the way. I thought I would do it when I was good and ready - not when anyone told me to do it The problem was I put that moment off time and time again.' A health scare in August 2010 proved the shock she needed. She said: 'I was walking to the car after work when my left leg suddenly went dead. I managed to get home but later than night, when I was in the garden with my friends, I collapsed. My left side went completely numb. Inspiration: Genese's daughter Amelia kept her going with moving messages of love and support . 'One of my friends was a nurse and told me to go to hospital straight away.' She was sent for CT and MRI scans at a stroke unit at Pinderfields Hospital where it was determined that despite suffering from stroke-like symptoms, her brain was not permanently damaged. She said: 'I was 33, so I was quite young to experience those types of symptoms. I was in hospital for two weeks and wasn’t able to return to work for six weeks. I needed intensive physiotherapy. 'The consultant said my weight played a huge part in what caused the episode. They were clear that if I lost weight, I’d be at less risk of it happening again, or suffering a full stroke.' Genese now opts for fruit for snacks and eats healthy home cooked meals . After trying to regulate her diet herself for a year, Ms Ackroyd eventually decided to join a slimming club in November 2011. Within a month she had lost an impressive 11lb, and her daughter Amelia began to measure her progress using her special hug test. She said: 'It upset Amelia that I wasn’t like all the other mums - that she couldn’t get her arms around me and give me a cuddle, something which seemed so normal for her school friends. 'One day she realised she could bring her fingertips together. Then, she was able to clasp her hands. Then she could get her arms around me. It was a real motivator. 'She also wrote me really encouraging notes which I have come to treasure.' Before beginning her weight loss journey Ms Ackroyd typically skipped breakfast and ate pastries and cakes like bakewell tarts for lunch before she gorged on unhealthy processed food like chicken nuggets or burgers with chips for an evening meal. She would snack on chocolate and crisps throughout the day. Today, she eats Weetabix with chopped fruit and milk for breakfast, followed by home-made soup with fruit and yogurt for lunch and slow-cooked chilli or casserole for dinner. When she snacks she always chooses fruit such as apples and pears. She can now fit into size 10 outfits. She said: 'I’m the smallest I’ve ever been, and I feel wonderful. Most important of all, I know that Amelia is very proud of me. 'We can do so much more things together. When I was bigger, I didn’t go out with her as much, and I wondered whether that was creating a barrier to us bonding. 'But today I feel so close to her, having shared my achievement with her. 'She’s always coming in close for a cuddle. The first thing she does when she gets home from school is give me a hug.'","Genese put on weight after birth of daughter Amelia .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It's not just Victoria Beckham, pictured, who can't resist splashing out on a new handbag - 50 per cent of women in the UK bought a new bag last year . It’s not just the Victoria Beckhams and Paris Hiltons of this world who can’t resist splashing out on a new handbag. More than half of British women have admitted to buying at least one new handbag last year, according to new research. And young women as well their mature counterparts both prioritise purchasing the accessory over every day essentials such as underwear. The report by consumer analysts Mintel shows that a total of 21 per cent of women say they have bought a handbag just to accompany a new outfit from the same store. And 16 per cent of women who have bought handbags in the last twelve months admit to having bought on impulse. When it comes to buying fashion accessories, including handbags, it seems most women still cannot resist a bargain, with over half (59 per cent) of them motivated by sales or discounts. And while low price remains key for many consumers, women aged 25-34 place the least importance on price, with just 47 per cent buying on sales or special offer compared to 56 per cent of 16-24s and 56 per cent of 35-44s. Tamara Sender, senior fashion analyst at Mintel, said: ‘While consumers have become considerably more prudent with their money as a result of the recession, women have continued to spend on fashion items, with handbags the main driver of sales.’ ‘The fact that younger women place more importance on handbags than on everyday essentials such as underwear is good news for the fashion industry - because as this fashion conscious generation grow up, they will continue to invest more as their earnings increase. More than a third of women aged between 16 to 24 (38 per cent) said they spend their extra money on handbags while 36 per cent bought underwear. And it is not just young women willing to splash out on the perfect accessories, those aged between aged 45 and 54 also see handbags as one of the most desirable fashion accessories, prioritising handbags (29 per cent) over underwear (26 per cent). More than a third of women aged between 16 to 24 said they spend their extra money on handbags while 36 per cent bought underwear, according to new research by consumer analysts Mintel . Miss Sender added: ‘Overall, handbags account for the largest share of the fashion accessories market and have seen the strongest sales in the sector, up 11 per cent between 2012 and 2013, to top £1.2 billion. Overall, the fashion accessories market grew by 4.7 per cent in 2013 to reach £2.5 billion.’ And it is not just women with a love of handbags in the UK, nearly one in 10 (8 per cent) of men spent money on a ‘manbag’ in the last year. While a new fashion trend is a key purchasing incentive for 14 per cent of women, the figure shoots up to 23 per cent amongst men. In addition, 22 per cent of male consumers claim to be motivated by innovation when they purchase a new bag for example bags with speakers for playing music.","Consumer report found 16 per cent of women bought handbag on impulse .

New York City comes in as a close second with an average delivery of $67.83, and Washington D.C. has placed third with an average $62 delivery. The findings stem from a study conducted by TripAdvisor, which evaluated ten four-star hotels in each of the U.S.’s 15 largest cities. Premium service: Las Vegas is home to the U.S.'s most expensive room service, where the average bill costs $68 . The site averaged hotel costs for what it considered to be a realistic room service bill: a room service club sandwich, the dry-cleaning of one shirt, and minibar items including a bottle of water, peanuts, a nip of vodka, and can of soda. In doing so, TripAdvisor also discovered that Denver is the least expensive U.S. city for room service with an average bill of $41.43. Seattle was the second cheapest with a $41.48 average, while Minneapolis came in  third with an average delivery costing $45.72.

Seoul came in third place with an average room bill of $73.31. Vodka vs. Water: In comparing the prices of vodka and water at hotels, it often seems that vodka is a cheaper alternative . And on the flip side, it is not entirely surprising to hear that many developing vacation locales are home to some of the world’s cheapest room service. Tunis, Tunisia is home to the most affordable in-room delivery with an average of $18.41, while Cape Town came in second with a typical bill costing $22.97.

"By . Lucy Waterlow . A widower has spoken of how he will never come to terms with the horrific murder of his beloved wife and step-daughter at the hands of his Turkish son-in-law. Ensar Gol, 22, repeatedly stabbed his wife, . Michala, 28, to death as she lay sleeping in their bed at home in Thame, Oxfordshire, . in September 2011. He then fatally attacked his mother-in-law, Julie Sahin, 50, when she tried to rush to her daughter's aid. Both women received dozens of stab wounds to their neck and bodies following Gol's premeditated murderous rampage. Holiday romance: Michala met Turkish waiter Gol when in Bodrum . Now Julie's husband, Mehmet, has spoken of his shock and grief in the new series of Britain's Darkest Taboos on the Crime + Investigation channel. He said: 'He took everything. I . didn't know till then that they were my only reason to live, my only joy in life. 'Julie was a fantastic mother, and a wife to me. I miss them loads.' Michala had met Gol, a waiter, while on holiday in the Turkish resort of Bodrum in 2007. Their holiday romance blossomed into a serious relationship and they married and had two children, eventually settling in the UK. Turkish native Mehmet said he and Julie - whose relationship had also begun as a holiday romance in 2002 - disapproved of the relationship but Michala wouldn't listen and wanted to make the marriage work after she had children. 'We did try to tell her, but Michala being Michalaâ€¦ she didnâ€™t want to hear any of that,' Mehmet said. 'After she's given birth to two kids she sort of felt that a father figure will have to be there.' Victims: Michala and her mother Julie, left, were stabbed to death by Gol . But, as Mehmet reveals, Gol became increasingly controlling of Michala; physically and verbally abusing her and cheating on her with a local barmaid. Their relationship reached breaking point in 2011 and Gol decided to return to Turkey - but Michala called him as he travelled to the airport and begged him to come home. 'If Michala hadn't have rung him and made him change his mind, I think they'd still be here today,' says her uncle, Wade Anderson, who also agreed to speak about the tragedy for the TV documentary. He added that Julie's 'pure hatred' for her son-in-law was no secret. 'She knew he was wrong for Michala, but Michala wouldn't listen. She might listen to what you'd say to her, but wouldn't do anything about it, because she was so committed,' Wade said. Not long after returning to the family home, Gol started plotting his murderous attack and even boasted about it on Facebook. Murderer: Michala's family never liked Gol but she stuck by him because of their children . Guilty: The accused smiled for the cameras when he arrived in court to be tried for murder . He messaged a cousin saying: 'This crazy Turk Wolf is going to cover London in blood. I have the knife ready.' On the night of 3rd September, after drinking heavily and having sex again with the local barmaid, Gol returned home and went into the kitchen to arm himself with a knife. He then went upstairs where . Michala was asleep with their daughter in the room and stabbed her repeatedly. Julie, who had been watching TV downstairs at the time with family friend Casey, heard muffled screams and rushed to Michala's aid. Mehmet, who was at work when the attack took place, said: 'All Julie wanted to do was to keep Michala safe. She just wanted to save her. She didn't care that . she might be dead.' When Julie and Casey tried to pull Gol off Michala he turned the knife on them. Casey managed to escape but Julie was fatally stabbed more than 50 times. As the women lay dying, Gol then picked up his four-year-old daughter - who had witnessed the horrific scene - and carried her out into the street with him, the murder weapon still in his hand. He was shouting: 'No one believed me, but I've done it. I've butchered them both.' Once he was arrested, he denied the murders saying he had acted in self-defence after Julie had attacked him first. Wade said: 'He never showed one ounce of remorse at all. I don't think he ever will. He said that Julie attacked him first, and he turned on them. Just rubbish.' Gol was pictured smiling as he arrived at Oxford Crown Court for his trial in May 2012. A jury of seven men and five women decided that Gol had been guilty of killing Michala and Julie, as well as trying to kill Casey, now 21. Shocking: The family home in Thame became a crime scene and Michala's young daughter witnessed the attacks . The judge told him he would serve 36 years for each murder and 12 years for the attempted killing to be run concurrently. Mehmet said he and the rest of the family are satisfied with the sentence but are now struggling to get on with their lives following the brutal murders.

The first athletes have only just taken to the slopes at the Winter Olympics, but the event is already being overshadowed by a series of embarrassing gaffes for President Putin. Today it was reported it appears that there are not enough pillows for the athletes in the Olympic Village. Luiza Baybakova, a member of the catering staff for the games, posted a photo of the news on her Instagram feed. The sign reported by Voactiv read: 'Attention dear colleagues! Due . to an extreme shortage of pillows for athletes who unexpectedly arrived . to Olympic Village in the mountains, there will be a transfer of . pillows from all apartments to the storehouse on 2 February 2014. Please . be understanding. We have to help the athletes out of this bind.' The . news suggests the athletes turned up before schedule or that the . planners had not ordered enough to accommodate the numbers.

She says that as of two days before the Games, she'd seen only a single foreigner - a South Korean. They couldn't understand each other, though, so had to communicate in sign language. Fears about terrorism and the hassle of reaching Sochi from points abroad may be keeping some foreigners away - and undermining Vladimir Putin's plans to transform Sochi into a magnet for international tourism. A train traveling between Olympic sites and downtown Sochi cheerily announces to visitors in English: 'We wish you a pleasant journey!' This Nasa image shows the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russia, the warmest city ever to host the Winter Olympic Games . Journalist Stacy St Clair tweets about her experience at the hotel . Anybody there? The stadium for the Sochi Olympics' debut event was almost entirely empty on Thursday - a discouraging start to a Winter Games already plagued with problems . The opening ceremony is not until Friday, but the sparse attendance does not bode well for the Sochi games . Notable absence: Nearly everyone in the stands was Russian, according to reports - raising questions about whether the world is willing to come to Sochi . But on a recent ride, its seats were half empty. And a sweep through four train cars found ... not a single foreign fan. it is not just spectators that are absent, however. The games are missing one crucial element: snow. Sochi is a Black Sea resort on the same latitude as Nice in the south of France, which is why all the outdoor activities actually take place 40 miles away. And to make matters worse, unseasonably warm temperatures have predicted for the duration of the event. The state of the hotels for journalists covering the games have not proved to be a success either. Today journalist Katie Baker wrote on Grantland.com: 'I had yet to eat my breakfast this morning when someone regaled me with a story about a guy staying up in Sochi’s mountaintop media hotel cluster who turned on his faucet and watched as sewage spilled out. Putin's rumoured girlfriend may be lighting the Olympic flame at the Fisht Stadium near the Black Sea it was reported today . 'Last night, a colleague returned to her room after a long day of work to find the door swung open, a set of keys still dangling from the lock. 'Nothing was stolen, but a TV had finally been installed. It could have been worse: The door to one guy’s room was supposedly kicked down by workers trying to put in a cable box.' Journalist Stacy St. Clair tweeted of her experience of having no water in her room on Twitter. She said she was told by a receptionist to avoid it even if restored: 'Do not use on your face because it contains something very dangerous.' Another news coming from Russia suggests that  Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rumoured girlfriend may be lighting the Olympic flame at the Fisht Stadium near the Black Sea. Although . it has never been confirmed Alina Kabayeva, a 2004 Olympic rhythmic . gymnastics champion, is thought to be Putin’s lover since he split up . with his wife last year. News.com.au. reported Putin said 'I’m aware of this (the . speculation), I was told of this by (Kremlin spokesman) Dmitry Peskov. These are the usual red herrings,' Putin said according to News.com.au. The shocking images and anecdotes comes after it emerged Russia exceeded its budget by millions to spend $32billion on the games. Russia insists widespread fears for human rights are unfounded despite a video by Human Rights Watch incorporating clips from some of the worst examples of homophobic violence in Russia which has been filmed and uploaded to the internet. However, Vladimir Putin has sanctioned action to be taken on the city's large population of stray dogs. In a bid to make the area presentable to welcome in people from around the world, the animals are being fed poison on the streets and left to die.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Torture permanently damages a human's normal perception of discomfort, scientists have warned. This picture is posed by an actor . Torture permanently damages a human's normal perception of discomfort, scientists have warned. Ex-prisoners of war (POWs), continue to . suffer from 'dysfunctional pain perception and regulation', likely as a . result of their torture, according to Israeli researchers. They found the ex-soldiers' bodies do not recover from immediate pain as quickly as people who have not been tortured and that they also feel pain more acutely if it is reoccurring. A team of scientists studied the long-term effects of torture on the human pain system by looking at a group of Israeli soldiers 40 years after they were captured. The soldiers who took part in the study were seized during the 1973 Yom Kippur War and were subjected to brutal torture in Egypt and Syria. Held alone in tiny, filthy spaces for weeks or months, sometimes handcuffed and blindfolded, they suffered severe beatings, burns, electric shocks and starvation, and rather than receiving treatment, additional torture was inflicted on existing wounds. Now research by Professor Ruth Defrin of the Department of Physical Therapy in the Sackler Faculty of Medicine at Tel Aviv University, shows that ex POWs continue to suffer from dysfunctional pain perception and regulation, probably as a result of their bad treatment decades ago. The study, which was conducted in . collaboration with Professor Zahava Solomon and Professor Karni Ginzburg . of the university's Bob Shapell School of Social Work and Professor . Mario Mikulincer of the School of Psychology at the Interdisciplinary . Centre, Herzliya, was published in the European Journal of Pain. 'The human body's pain system can either inhibit or excite pain. It's two sides of the same coin, said Professor Defrin. 'Usually, when it does more of one, it does less of the other, but in Israeli ex POWs, torture appears to have caused dysfunction in both directions. Our findings emphasise that tissue damage can have long-term systemic effects and needs to be treated immediately.' A team of scientists studied the long-term effects of torture on the human pain system by looking at a group of Israeli soldiers 40 years after they were captured and tortured. A machine that was used to administer electric shocks in previous, unrelated studies is pictured . The study focused on 104 combat veterans of the Yom Kippur War, 60 of whom were taken prisoner during the war, and 44 of whom were not. All participants of the study were put through a battery of psychophysical pain tests, which included applying a heating device to one arm, submerging the other arm in a hot water bath and pressing a nylon fibre into a middle finger, and then filled out psychological questionnaires. The researchers believe non-physical torture - such as solitary confinement, illustrated - may have also contributed to the ex POWs' chronic pain . The ex POWs exhibited diminished pain . inhibition  - the degree to which the body eases one pain in response to . another - and heightened pain excitation, which is the degree to which . repeated exposure to the same sensation heightens the resulting pain. Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that the torture survivors' bodies now regulate pain in a dysfunctional way. It is not entirely clear whether the dysfunction is the result of years of chronic pain or of the original torture itself, but the ex POWs exhibited worse pain regulation than the non POW chronic pain sufferers in the study. A statistical analysis of the test data also suggested that being tortured had a direct effect on their ability to regulate pain. The researchers believe non-physical torture may have also contributed to the ex POWs' chronic pain. Among other forms of oppression and humiliation, the ex POWs were not allowed to use the toilet, were cursed at and threatened, told demoralising misinformation about their loved ones and were exposed to mock executions. In the later stages of captivity, most of the POWs were transferred to a group cell, where social isolation was replaced by intense friction, crowding and loss of privacy. 'We think psychological torture also affects the physiological pain system,' says Professor Defrin. 'We still have to fully analyse the data, but preliminary analysis suggests there is a connection,' she added.","Tel Aviv University researchers found ex-prisoners of war continued to suffer from dysfunctional pain perception 40 years after being tortured .

"By . Ben Spencer . A quarter of the bumblebees in Europe are at risk of extinction as their habitats are destroyed, according to a new report. The loss of the bees will place farming in crisis because of the insects’ vital role in pollinating crops, claim conservationists. Sixteen of 68 bumblebee species in Europe are at risk, according to the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). A quarter of the bumblebees, stock image pictured, in Europe are at risk of extinction as their habitats are destroyed, according to a new report. The loss of the bees will place farming in crisis because of the insects' vital role in pollinating crops, claim conservationists . Bumblebees live in small nests of up to . 200 bees and do not make honeycombs. Bigger than honeybees, they usually . have yellow and black stripes. Half of Europe’s bumblebee species have falling populations and just 13 per cent are increasing. Some 26 of the listed 68 species live in Britain, of which 12 are decreasing, six stable and five increasing. Some 26 of the listed species live in Britain, of which 12 are decreasing, six are stable and five increasing. The IUCN, which brings together governments, scientists and conservation groups, said: ‘Of the five most important insect pollinators of European crops, three are bumblebee species. ‘Together with other pollinators, bumblebees contribute more than £18billion (€22 billion euros) to European agriculture a year,’ its report said. The biggest threat to bumblebees is the destruction of wildflower meadows which gives them a food supply. The mass use of herbicides and pesticides has also been a big blow, with chemicals used to remove ‘weeds’ such as clover from farmlands that the insects feed on.

The European Union’s top environment official said the EU’s 28 nations were taking action to improve the situation. EU Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said: ‘The EU recently banned or restricted the use of certain pesticides that are dangerous to bees and is funding research into status of pollinators. ‘However, efforts clearly need to be scaled up.’ Recent studies have found that diseases from commercial honeybee hives are spreading to bumblebees. A study in the journal Nature said that deformed wing virus, for instance, was found in both honeybees and bumblebees in Britain. The virus was more prevalent in honeybees, suggesting it was spreading from them to bumblebees.","Report finds a quarter of bumblebees in Europe are at risk of extinction .

"By . Ruth Styles . With a daily regime that includes 7am starts, intensive military fitness training and a mountain of tack to clean, a stint at the Northern Racing College in Doncaster would be challenging for anyone. But the students who take the 10-week intensive courses offered by the college are no ordinary teens. Many have been in trouble with the police, can barely read or write and have been expelled from school. 'Without this place, some kids would . probably never achieve anything,' explains Malcolm Bygrave, the course manager. 'All our kids are turnarounds. Every one . of these kids has come in here with a goal and if we can get them out . into a racing yard, then they might achieve that goal.' Ambitious: Tyler was expelled from school aged 14 and can barely read but dreams of becoming a jockey . Now the school is to feature in a new Channel 4 documentary that follows the teenage pupils as they bid to overcome their problems and become the Grand National winners of the future. Among them is Stacey, 15, from Cumbria, who has spent most of her short life in and out of trouble with the police thanks to her penchant for fighting. 'A lass came to pick on us one day,' she says of her last fight. 'She started saying stuff about about my family and pulled my hair, and I . flipped. I just saw red. But I'd really damaged her and put her in . hospital. I got expelled for . it. She adds: 'My mum and I do fight. We start punching each other. I've got . scars all over my knuckles from fighting with her.' Joining her is traveller Tyler, 16, from County Durham who was expelled from school aged 14 and struggles to read and write but dreams of becoming a jockey. Naughty: Stacey, 15, has been in trouble with the police because of her penchant for fighting . The dream: Tyler and Stacey dream of emulating A.P McCoy, winner of last year's Grand National . 'If I've had a bad day then I'll jump on a horse and it'll calm me down,' he explains. 'I'm . hoping to be a jockey. If I didn't have this opportunity, I'd probably . be riding around with horses, signing on the dole and I don't want that.' Both will take part in a 10-week intensive course at the National Racing College, after which, provided they pass, they will be given a placement in a racing stable and the chance to become a professional jockey. But it won't be easy. Instructors at the school enforce a tough regime with strict rules on behaviour that include prohibitions on swearing, wearing make-up and fraternising with the opposite sex. Along with yard duties and riding, the teens also have to endure daily bootcamp-style workouts under the eagle eye of military fitness trainer Rudy - much to the horror of many. 'He's evil!' sniffs Stacey after being made to complete laps of the paddock followed by a tough set of squats and lunges. Rudy is less than impressed. 'The racing industry's hard - it's hard,' he explains. 'They need to grow up a little more and toughen up.' Toughening up is a key part of the educational experience at the Northern Racing College, although maths and English also form part of the curriculum. 'We have all sorts,' adds Malcolm. 'We have students that . come in with very low level of education. We have students who come in . that would struggle to write their own name.' But while he's sympathetic, it swiftly becomes clear that Malcolm has no intention of putting up with teenage tantrums once his students arrive on the gallops. Hard work: Fitness is a crucial part of becoming a racing jockey - hence the military style workouts . Painful process: Students at the Northern Racing College spend hours riding, then do hours of yard chores . 'Whinging and whining - you always get . this in the first couple of weeks but we'll soon knock it out of them,' he fumes after hearing Stacey moaning during a circuit on the gallops. 'Everyone's got their own style of teaching and mine's probably more aggressive than most but that's what some of these kids need.' One who seems to need a bit of tough love is Tyler, who repeatedly invites the ire of instructors thanks to his constant larking about. 'Sometimes you're teaching him and he . thinks he knows best,' grumbles Malcolm. 'Tyler's come here on the attitude he's going to . get by on his charm, what little he has, and now he knows its about hard . work. He needs to stop being a boy and start being a man.' Despite the harsh regime, it becomes clear that the school has worked wonders on the troubled teens by the end of the course. Stacey, who arrived with a hair trigger temper and an over-reliance on her fists, seems calmer, while Tyler manages to pass his English and maths exams for the first time. Graduates: A handful of students are given placements on racing yards after completing the course . Future star? Tyler, who passed the course, says he plans to go on and become a race-winning jockey . 'I have changed... I've changed quite a lot,' says Stacey, who will be heading home to Cumbria after the course ends. 'I was one of the worst when I got here but my attitude, my anger levels... they've just changed.' Tyler, by contrast, is staying on to be primed for a career as a racing jockey - much to the tearful delight of his parents and Auntie Charlene. 'I'm over the moon,' he beams, utterly thrilled. 'I had to go and call my Auntie Charlene [to tell her he passed the course], and she said she felt like crying. I have made me family proud and me mum's proud of us - I definitely will make it as a jockey.' 'It's not all about the horses,' explains an equally proud Malcolm. 'It's . about putting a good grounding into them so that when they go to a trainer's . yard, they might not be the finished product but they'll be well on the . way to it. 'Not every student is cut out for racing but we can train them up to the point where they'll be of value to someone.'

"By . Associated Press . The doctors and therapists who worked with a little girl from Afghanistan knew the prosthetic arm they gave her would change her life. What they didn't anticipate was that within weeks of strapping on her new limb, seven-year-old Shah Bibi Tarakhail would be using it to pick up a brush and begin carving out a new life â€” of abstract painting. 'What color would you like?' asked artist Davyd Whaley as he sat next to her at a table at the Galerie Michael on Rodeo Drive in the heart of Beverly Hills on Wednesday afternoon. Bright future: Shah Bibi Tarakhail, seven, who lost her arm and right eye after picking up a grenade in her native Afghanistan, is seen painting with her new prosthetic arm during a private session with artist Dayvd Whaley in Beverly Hills, California . 'That one!' the normally reticent girl responded with a determined voice as she pointed to a tube of blue acrylic. Then, before her mentor could fetch it, she grabbed it with her new prosthetic hand, unscrewed the top with her other hand and began squeezing the tube's contents onto a palette. As her friends from the nonprofit Children of War Foundation and the Shriners Hospital for Children Los Angeles looked on with delight, Shah Bibi proceeded to put a series of broad brush strokes across a piece of art board Whaley had provided. Soon there were shades of blue, green and bright orange laid out across little stickers of fish, bunnies, a flower and sky that Whaley had showed her how to place on the board beforehand. At one point she giggled with embarrassment as she accidentally squeezed a tube of orange paint onto the painting rather than the palette. But Whaley quickly assured her that accidental art sometimes makes the best abstract art. 'You're going to do a Jackson Pollock,' he quipped. The finished result, the artist said afterward, 'was pretty mind-blowing.' Shah Bibi, he said, not only handles a brush well but has an impressive grasp of matching colors. 'She . kind of has a facility for it if she wants to pursue it,' added the . artist whose own work is the subject of a large exhibition on display at . Galerie Michael. Talented: Shah Bibi shows off her latest masterpiece. Whaley (right) has described her work as 'mind-blowing' Industrious: Shah Bibi gets to work on her next painting while artist Dayvd Whaley (far right) and Galerie Michael owner Michael Schwartz (center) look on . Less than a year ago, Shah Bibi was back at home in Afghanistan when she went outside one morning to play with her brother. There had been a violent battle pitting Taliban fighters against U.S. military forces the night before, but that was nothing residents weren't used to. Their village had been a cauldron of violence since the Afghan war began. 'There was what looked like a rock that she picked up and threw on the ground and it exploded,' said Ilaha Omar, a Children of War Foundation member who brought her to the United States, where Shriners Hospital treated her for free. The explosion had destroyed her right eye, taken off most of her right arm, put a few scars on her face and killed her brother. She was a little frightened the first time he saw her, said David Kraft, a prosthetist who helped fit her with her new arm. But she quickly warmed to the people around her and impressed them with how quickly she learned how to use it. Life-changing: The youngster shakes hands with her doctor, Shriners Hospitals for Children certified prosthetist David Craft, who was born without his left arm . She'll return to her family next week, but Children of War plans to bring her back next year to fit her with a prosthetic eye and attend to her scars. Fluent in the Afghan languages of Pashto and Dari, she's also picked up a good deal of English since arriving in the U.S. late last year. Also an affinity for American culture. Decked out in a pretty dress and a pair of Minnie Mouse shoes, she sometimes sang along to the song 'Let it Go' from the Disney film 'Frozen' as she painted. Afterward she was a bit quiet but still all smiles as she wandered the gallery with an iPhone, snapping pictures of the paintings, the sculptures and the people. And also a few selfies to take back home. Fond memories: Shah Bibi takes a selfie with Ilaha Omar, the Children of War Foundation member who brought her to the United States where she could be treated for free . Creative inspiration: Young artist Shah Bibi uses an iPhone to snap a bronze sculpture at Galerie Michael . But before heading home to her host family and then Afghanistan there was still some unfinished business. As the afternoon grew longer and the gallery crowd thinned, Whaley asked if she might like to do another painting. 'Yes!' came the exuberant reply. And the pair got back to work.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Climate change has been blamed for many things - from melting ice caps to extreme storms - but it’s now threatening a British staple. The Tocklai tea station has been recording daily weather and tea production data for more than a century and has found a rise in temperature, coupled with erratic rainfall, is damaging tea leaves globally. For example, ambient temperatures in Assam, India have risen from 35°C to upwards of 50°C and after 48°C, tea leaves stop breathing and are destroyed. India produces a third of the world's tea and the Assam region, including the tea fields near Kaziranga National Park, pictured, produces more than half of it. According to the Tea Research Association, global temperatures are inching upwards globally, due to climate change, and all the tea-producing belts are affected . Lack of rainwater and droughts affect how much tea is produced, while floods destroy anything that does grow. In Assam, in particular, the ambient temperature has increased from 35°C to upwards of 50°C out of the shade. Between . 35°C and 39°C photosynthesis slows down, and when temperatures reach . 48°C, the tea leaves stop breathing and are destroyed. In . addition, the use of pesticide is regulated in tea regions . meaning when pests do infest the estates, they’re damage is more . significant. India produces a third of the world’s tea and the Assam region produces more than half of it. Kenya, Sri Lanka and China are also major exporters of tea and the regions sit on what’s known as the tea-belt. According to the Tea Research Association, global temperatures are inching upwards globally, and all the tea-producing belts are affected. The Tocklai tea station, in particular, found the minimum temperature across the belts has risen by 1.5°C, while the annual rainfall has dropped by 200mm. This not only affects the amount of tea that is produced, but also increases how much production costs. The Tocklai tea station, pictured, has been recording daily weather and tea production data for more than a century. It found the minimum temperature across the tea regions has risen by 1.5°C, while the annual rainfall has dropped by 200 millimetres . Although the overall annual rainfall has dropped, the region is also subject to erratic storms, followed by droughts. Manish Bargaria, who owns a tea estate in northern Assam told the BBC: ‘What we have been noticing over the decade is we get a lot of rainfall in one particular month or a couple of months and that erodes the topsoil of the tea garden. Endangered? Tufts University is examining how climate change affects the concentration of chemical compounds found in tea . ‘While that already affects our production, the dry spell makes our bushes prone to pests, for which we have to use more pesticides and that means higher costs.’ In Assam, in particular, the ambient temperature has increased to upwards of 50°C in the sunshine. Aside from the changing weather, other conditions needed to produce the tea are affected. Between 35°C and 39°C, for example, photosynthesis slows down, and when temperatures reach 48°C, the tea leaves are ruined. In addition, the use of pesticide is regulated in tea regions meaning when pests do infest the estates, they’re damage is more significant. Due to this fluctuating weather, the quality of the tea leaves that do grow is also affected. Biologists from Tufts University have embarked on a study that will examine how climate change affects the concentration of chemical compounds found in tea, including their health benefits. 'Since the quality of tea is determined by a range of secondary chemicals that depend on climatic conditions, climate change can have significant consequences for tea markets,"" said lead Colin researcher Orians. 'People buy and drink tea for certain qualities. If those qualities are not there, then they may not buy the tea.' Orians said that the team hopes to be able to work out exactly how climate change is affecting tea production in order to develop ways of adapting to the changes.","India produces a third of the world’s tea and Assam accounts for over half .

"By . Mark Prigg . Over 10,000 historic maps of New York have been scanned and made available online by the New York Public Library. The library has also unveiled a radical new 'warping' feature that allows users to superimpose any of the maps onto modern-day New York to see changes. It allows users to virtually fly around the maps, seeing just how Manhattan has evolved. Scroll down for video . The new 'warper' tool allows users to view the historic maps in Google Earth and other apps on top of modern-day New York . Although the maps are primarily of New York, the digital maps also include: . 1,100 maps of the Mid-Atlantic United States and cities from the 16th to 19th centuries, mostly drawn from the Lawrence H. Slaughter Collection; . More than 700 topographic maps of the Austro-Hungarian empire created between 1877 and 1914 . 2,800 maps from state, county and city atlases (mostly New York and New Jersey) More than 10,300 maps from property, zoning, topographic, but mostly fire insurance atlases of New York City dating from 1852 to 1922 . More than 1,000 maps of New York City, its boroughs and neighborhoods, dating from 1660 to 1922. 'NYPL has now scanned nearly all of its public domain New York City atlases, a collection of now more than 10,000 maps,' Matt Knutzen of the library revealed in a blog post announcing the project. He also revealed the 'warper' tool that allows the old maps to be put on top of new maps. 'We have also built a web tool where users both inside and outside the Library can virtually stretch old maps onto a digital model of the world Ã  la Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, thus creating a new copy that is not only aligned with spatial coordinates on the Earth, but normalized across the entire archive of old maps.' The library worked with staff, volunteers, and interns, a group of roughly 1,500 participants worldwide to complete the ambitious project. This is the first time the majority of the maps have been made available online. An 1863 map of Central Park that is opart of the collection.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . To solve the rising number of plastic bottles filling up landfills around the world, a trio of designers has created an alternative - a container made from an edible algae balloon. Called Ooho, the spheres can be produced in different sizes, hygienically protect the liquid inside, and cost just 2 cents (less than a penny) each. The design was recently crowned one of 12 winners of the second annual Lexus Design Award and is due to go on sale in Boston later this year.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Climate-changing microbes, known as Methanosarcina (pictured), may have caused the biggest mass extinction in history . The worst mass extinction in Earth's history - long before dinosaurs roamed the planet - was caused by microbes, according to a new study. The tiny organisms suddenly began belching out the greenhouse gas methane - which is about 20 per cent more potent than carbon dioxide - some 250 million years ago. Fumes spurted from the oceans wiping out 90 per cent of all species, from snails and small crustaceans to early forms of lizards and amphibians in less than 20,000 years. The 'Great Dying' occurred more than 252 million years ago - long before dinosaurs lived roamed Earth - at the end of Permian era. In the past asteroids, volcanoes and raging coal fires have been blamed but the finger is now being pointed at tiny microbes called Methanosarcina. These spewed enormous amounts of methane into the atmosphere, dramatically altering the climate and the chemistry of the oceans. Unable to adapt in time, countless species perished and vanished from the Earth. Alarmingly, the same effects are starting to happen today as a result of global warming caused by carbon emissions. Analysis of geological carbon deposits . reveals a significant boost in levels of carbon-containing gases - . either carbon dioxide or methane - at the time of the mass extinction. The Permian extinction, which occurred around 250 million years ago, was one of the biggest catastrophes that caused a majority of the land and aquatic species to become extinct. Pictured is the fossil skull of Dinogorgon Rubidgei, which did not survive the Permian extinction . The Permian extinction, which occurred around 250 million years ago, was one of the biggest catastrophes that caused a majority of the land and aquatic species to become extinct. Until now, the causes that triggered the collapse of the Permian period have remained a mystery. Some scientists have suggested extinction was caused by an asteroid strike or a volcanic eruption in an area, what is now called Siberia. They claim this led to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions and caused the mass extinction of the Earth's species. New research, however, suggests that microbes began belching out the greenhouse gas methane - which is about 20 per cent more potent than carbon dioxide. Fumes suddenly spurted from the oceans wiping out 90 per cent of all species. But volcanic eruptions alone could never have produced the amount of carbon laid down in rock sediments during this period, the researchers claim. 'A rapid initial injection of carbon dioxide from a volcano would be followed by a gradual decrease,' said US scientist Dr Gregory Fournier, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 'Instead, we see the opposite: a rapid, continuing increase. 'That suggests a microbial expansion. The growth of microbial populations is among the few phenomena capable of increasing carbon production exponentially, or even faster.' A timely combination of two factors may have sent Methanosarcina into overdrive, according to the findings reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. First, a genetic change allowed it to become a major producer of methane from accumulations of carbon dioxide in the oceans. Second, a surge in volcanic activity led to a sudden influx of nickel, a vital nutrient that helped the microbes proliferate.","Microbes belched out the methane 250 million years ago, claims study .

"By . Bianca London . After three 'reem' years of vajazzles, make-ups and break-ups on TOWIE, Sam Faiers dramatically confirmed she is leaving the ITV2 show in an emotional series finale last night. The blonde star - who was recently diagnosed with Crohn's disease - told sister Billie and friends James 'Arg' Argent and Jess Wright that she needed to take some time away from the show to concentrate on her rekindled relationship with former TOWIE star Joey Essex. But that doesn't mean Sam's success outside of the show is going to be slowing down anytime soon - the 23-year-old has just been snapped up by Fake Bake to be the ambassador of its Beyond Bronze range. FEMAIL caught up with Sam to find out . her beauty secrets, summer style tips and plans for the future - which . is most certainly looking bright. Glam Sam: Samantha Faiers, who last night announced her departure from TOWIE, has just been unveiled as the face of Fake Bake's Beyond Bronze range so FEMAIL caught up with her to chat all things beauty . The blonde reality TV star is using her fake tan expertise to act as a brand ambassador and educate young girls about the dangers of sun beds. 'I've always used Fake Bake, it's my number one tan and my mum would buy it me for Christmas every year,' she said. 'This range is targetted at a younger audience to steer them away from sunbeds. 'I will be going around some schools in the UK and teaching youngsters to look after their skin by using fake tan. Pastures new: Sam Faiers confirmed Wednesday night's episode will be her last on TOWIE . 'We're thinking of going away and having some spray tan and spray champagne parties. Instead of being a face of it, I'm more like an ambassador and I've always used fake tan so it's a nice job for me to talk about.' While Sam sports a golden glow as we meet her in the May Fair Hotel, she admits she hasn't always got it right. 'When I first started TOWIE I was rather dark, I used to OTT it! I always think you have to prep your skin, I used to whack it on and wake up streaky,' she said. Beauty aficionado: Sam, pictured with the new range, says she is a real 'girl's girl' and is obsessed with buying make-up . After much trial and error, Sam says she's finally got it right and crams her make-up bag with plenty of products to keep her looking red carpet-ready. Opening up her make-up bag, she said: 'I am such a girl's girl, my make-up bag . is endless. Everytime I'm at the airport, I'm at the MAC counter stocking up, it's ridiculous really. 'My mum . always asks if I've got enough but there's never enough!' Sam's hero products include HD brows, MAC eyeshadow and lipsticks, NARS blusher and its Laguna bronzer, which she says is be a summer must-have. She also loves a good budget buy and swears by Maybelline's Eye Studio Master Precise Ink Pen Eyeliner. 'I used this all throughout Celebrity Big Brother, everyone was using it in the end,' she laughed. Despite having her make-up routine down to a T, she struggles when styling her hair. 'I'm not very good at my own hair, I usually go to a salon before an event. 'I can do my make-up in an hour, I'm a pro now,' she said. In an attempt to emulate her all-time beauty and style icon, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Sam has incorporated rosehip oil into her beauty regime. 'I researched Rosie and she swears by it so I bought some and I love it. I put it on my face and eyes before bed and wake up and my skin feels so soft.' While she's keen to copy Rosie's beauty regime, you won't catch Sam slurping on a green juice like the supermodel anytime soon. 'Rosie loves juices and supplements. In LA it's so easy to grab gluten-free food and smoothies at every corner but in Essex it's not really like that, you've got nice restaurants to indulge in and I do try but I don't drive myself mad. Good taste: Sam cites Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (right) as her all-time idol and has even been using the supermodel's beloved rosehip oil in an attempt to emulate her . 'I like my food but I do eat healthy as well. I love fish and I eat seafood over meat, which helps me.I love a treat day and tea and biscuits has been my downfall ever since I was a little girl and it will never stop, you've got to enjoy it haven't you?'. As well as her dramatic exit from TOWIE, trim new figure and relationship with Joey Essex, Sam's sophisticated new style has been making headlines, too. Sam, who describes her style as 'current and girly', said: 'It's really nice to be recognised for my style because when I started TOWIE it was all about the diamonds and the glittery dresses. 'I've been working with a lovely stylist . called Laurie Hadleigh and it's working out so well. I am so busy so it's . great that she can put an outfit together for me based on what I like . and help me accessorise, something I am bad at! 'I love keeping it high street. My fans love affordable fast fashion and I do as well. Don't get me wrong, I love my statement designer pieces like bags and shoes but I love brands like Missguided, too.' Now and then: Sam, who describes her style now (pictured left) as 'current and girly', said: 'It's really nice to be recognised for my style because when I started TOWIE (right) it was all about the diamonds and the glittery dresses' Sam may have been the fashionista of the show but she still rates her former co-stars' style. 'Lauren Pope dresses really well and even though my sister Billie is seven months pregnant, she always looks amazing. 'Over the last year, a lot of the girls have really pushed it in the fashion stakes and everyone's on top of it. Exfoliate . Don't apply deodorant . Leave skin totally . fresh . Moisturise hands and feet . Apply it . in natural light . If you make a mistake, put moisturiser on a cotton pad and . buff it in . 'The girls definitely make more effort than the boys who sometimes turn up to filming scruffy and hungover and I'm like ""Come on, this is Essex, we all need to look glamorous and on point"" 'Dan dresses like a dancer, he's casual. Charlie is going for that cool Kanye West vibe; they're getting there!,' she said. Speaking about her fitness regime, Sam revealed that she isn't following in her best friend Lucy Mecklenburgh's footsteps. 'Lucy is doing amazingly well with her fitness company but with me, when it comes to fitness, I don't do it every single day, it's not part of my daily routine. 'I will do it when I'm working towards something and with summer coming, I am getting back into it. 'For me, it's not really about weight loss, it's more about toning so I've been doing squats and sit-ups with my trainer to tone.' Young love: Sam revealed on last night's TOWIE that she's leaving the show to focus on her relationship with Joey Essex . As she waves goodbye to the bright lights of Romford, nights at Sugar Hut and girly chats with Gemma Collins, Sam says she is excited about the year to come. 'There's so many bits and bobs going on. I've got holidays, some travelling and other fashion and beauty stuff. I am really looking forward to this year. 'In five years time, I'd like Minnie's to be an empire of her own, expand it and make it the next ASOS. 'I'll be an auntie then, maybe I'll have a family of my own. Five years is a long way off, I don't know where I'll be, hopefully on a yacht in LA.'","Sam, 23, announced departure from TOWIE in last night's show .

"By . Mark Prigg . Scientists have used brain scanners to detect and reconstruct the faces that people are thinking of, effectively reading their minds. Researchers use fMRI scans to successfully identify the faces people were looking at. They say the discovery could allow witnesses to create e-fits simply by thinking about a criminal's face - and could even help reconstruct dreams. Researchers showed participants a series of pictures of faces (left) and them monitored their brain activity with an fMRI scanner before reconstructing the images (right) Researchers showed six subjects 300 different 'training' faces while undergoing fMRI scans. They used the data to create a sort of statistical library of how those brains responded to individual faces. They then showed the six subjects new sets of faces while they were undergoing scans. Using that fMRI data alone, researchers used their statistical library to reconstruct the faces their subjects were viewing. Researchers say the accuracy of these facial reconstructions will increase with time and he envisions they can be used as a research tool, for instance in studying how autistic children respond to faces. It builds on previous experiments where researchers were able to work out whether people were looking at beach or city scenes from scans. Using only data from an fMRI scan, researchers led by a Yale University undergraduate have accurately reconstructed images of human faces as viewed by other people. 'It is a form of mind reading,' said Marvin Chun, professor of psychology, cognitive science and neurobiology and an author of the paper in the journal Neuroimage. The increased level of sophistication of fMRI scans has already enabled scientists to use data from brain scans taken as individuals view scenes and predict whether a subject was, for instance, viewing a beach or city scene, an animal or a building. 'But they can only tell you they are viewing an animal or a building, not what animal or building,' Chun said. 'This is a different level of sophistication.' One of Chun’s students, Alan S. Cowen, wanted to know whether it would be possible to reconstruct a human face from patterns of brain activity. The researchers say they were able to reconstruct the faces because we process far more information about faces that other images we see . The team say their research could one day be used by police to create more accurate photofits from witnesses. The task was daunting, the team said, because faces are more similar to each other than buildings. Also large areas of the brain are recruited in the processing of human faces, a testament to its importance in survival. 'We perceive faces in a much greater level of detail than we perceive other things,' Cowen said. 'You can even imagine, way down the road, a witness to a crime might want to come in and reconstruct a suspect’s face.' The reconstructed images were good enough for the researchers to work out which face was being looked at from a selection of 600 . Working with funding from the Yale Provost’s office, Cowen and post doctoral researcher Brice Kuhl, now an assistant professor at New York University, . The team showed six subjects 300 different 'training” faces while undergoing fMRI scans. They used the data to create a sort of statistical library of how those brains responded to individual faces. They then showed the six subjects new sets of faces while they were undergoing scans. spot the face: Researchers used fMRI scans to work out which faces subjects were looking at .

Cowen said the accuracy of these facial reconstructions will increase with time and he envisions they can be used as a research tool, for instance in studying how autistic children respond to faces. Chun said the study shows the value of funding research ambitions of Yale undergraduates. 'I would never have received external funding for this, it was too novel,' Chun said. The team wrote that their discovery could also be used in other areas - and even reconstructing dreams. 'This methodology not only represents a novel and promising approach for investigating face perception, but also suggests avenues for reconstructing ‘offline’ visual experiences—including dreams, memories, and imagination—which are chiefly represented in higher-level cortical areas.'","Researchers used fMRI scans for experiments .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . A man who first rose to fame after performing at the Superbowl with Madonna has now made his way into the record books - after walking the world's highest ever slackline. A piece of fabric suspended midair between two hot air balloons in the Nevada desert, 4,000 feet above the ground, was the scene where Andy Lewis, 27, from California, set the record - in less than 20 seconds. The record was for the highest line ever walked above ground level. The previous record was 3,000 feet - a number easily beaten by Mr Lewis. Scroll down for video . Andy Lewis set the world record for the highest slackline to be walked above ground level. At an astounding 4,000 feet above ground, Mr Lewis walked the rope held by two hot air balloons in the middle of the Nevada desert . Mr Lewis smashed the previous record - which was 3,000 feet, by 1,000 feet. He completed the challenge near Las Vegas last month . The daredevil, from California is known as 'Sketchy Andy' because he will brave any challenge which comes his way . The fabric measured just 39 feet in length and was set up in the desert near Las Vegas. And Mr Lewis did not even use a leash for the crossing, his safety net was a parachute attached to his body. To prepare himself for the moment, Mr Lewis and his team did trial runs at the somewhat lower height of 6-10 feet and then 600-700 feet before untying the balloons and pulling them to the extraordinary height of 4,000 feet. While he walked, his friend Jona Marie-Price dangled upside down in mid-air and admired the scene. Mrs Price, who provided the balloons and helped design the project, is the inspiration behind the record. Mrs Price is pictured below dangling upside down and draped in colorful ribbons. Ready for a challenge: Mr Lewis is pictured here climbing out of the hot air balloon basket before making the 20 second journey across to other crew members - on a tiny piece of fabric flying thousands of feet above the ground . It's a long way up: Andy Lewis prepares to step onto the slackline and smash a world record in just 20 seconds . Mr Lewis walks the 12 metre-long line while his friend Jona-Marie Price, the brains behind the project, watches dangled upside down in mid-air . To balance himself on the line, Mr Lewis spread his arms out wide while he walked . After completing the record, Mr Lewis balanced himself on the edge of the hot air balloon and punched the air in celebration . Mr Lewis, who is known under the nickname 'Stetchy Andy' because of his willingness to try his hand at anything - no matter how high - completed the stunt. After the stunt, Mr Lewis said: 'It felt amazing to be on the line, it was very free and incredibly exposed. 'I will have a lot of self-doubt before I . walk the line but the nerves turned into excitement and the excitement . turned into focus and I love walking when it's a challenge the most.' It's a great view: The slackliner holds himself upside down and admires the view from the line - 4,000 feet above ground level . That's what I had in store: Mr Lewis surveys the air balloons from ground level . Mr Lewis grinning for the camera after completing the challenge. After skydiving down to ground, he is pictured right after setting a new world record . Just three weeks before a French team, known has The Skyliners or 'The Flying Frenchies' had failed when they attempted the feat in Spain. And the challenge wasn't enough for the Californian, now based in Utah, who then skydived down to ground from the mid-air scene. He described the dive as like 'a victory dance'. He said: 'The skydive was a release after the tension of the high line. 'Falling is so easy compared to high lining. It's like a victory dance.' Before taking on the real challenge Mr Lewis practiced by setting up the line just metres above the ground . The hot air balloons are pictured here getting ready for the world record. Moments later they began their ascent to 4,000 feet above ground level . In 2012, Mr Lewis brought slacklining into popular culture by performing alongside Madonna at the 2012 Superbowl half-time show. Madonna was so in awe of the sportsman that she then asked him to come on tour with him. Mr Lewis turned the offer down because he wanted to continue traveling the world living the 'slacklife'. He described this as: 'about finding your passions and doing your best'. The video of the successful stunt was released to promote the launch of the new online adventure network the Limitless Channel . You can find out more about this stunt at www.limitlesschannel.tv . The height of the slackline was almost a seventh of the height of Mount Everest - which measures 29,000 feet. The Empire State Building measures 1,250 feet - less than three times the height of the line. Its height was almost four times higher than the Eiffel Tower - with a height of 1,062 feet. With 163 floors and measuring 2,716 feet, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the tallest man-made structure in the world. But the line was set up more than 1,000 feet higher than the tip of the Dubai building. From afar, this man looks as though he is stepping through thin air - in fact, thousands of miles from Nevada, these line walkers took on a challenge of their own and set a UK record for line walking in Snowdonia, Wales. Above an equally dramatic scenery, Guy Ruyssevelt, 24, Tom Parker, 23, and Dutch circus performer Jacob Hirsch went highlining over the Ogwen Valley in Snowdonia. At 250 feet, above a steep drop, they set the record for the highline completed at the highest altitude ever in the UK. And once they had finished, daredevil Tom Parker dangled himself upside down from the piece of fabric. The scene was captured by British photographer Ray Wood, 44 who photographed the walkers making their way across the 40 metre-long rope at the summit of the Tryfan Mountain. Guy Ruyssevelt walks through the sky - 250 feet above ground level - to set the UK record for the highest height walked across a rope above ground level . Dramatic: Walkers braved heights of 250 feet in Snowdonia, Wales as they walked across a piece of rope suspended in mid-air . It took them two hours to reach the scene. Once they had arrived, a line was erected after the climbers put slings around large blocks and boulders to keep the piece of fabric in place. Mr Wood said he felt 'lucky' to have witnessed the scene and described the day as one of the most exciting of his career. He said: 'It was the position of the highline that made it spectacular. Because of its location near the summit of Tryfan it was the highest-altitude highline made to date in the UK and that made it a really special event. 'I was so lucky to see these guys in action, they made it look incredibly graceful and from a distance it looked as if they were walking in the sky.' Mr Wood said that the highliners had to adjust their balance as the rope moved under their feet. He said: 'If the line is set-up properly the high liners shouldn’t be in any danger, however, there’s a great deal of critical judgement in the complex rigging of the line. 'The pressure placed on the anchors by simply walking across a taut high line can be incredibly large and that’s before the shock of falling-off on to the line is taken into account. 'It isn’t something to be considered without having somebody involved with a great deal of experience at setting-up highlines.' Circus performer Jacob Hirsch travelled from Holland to set the UK record . The walk was not enough for highliner Tom Parker who then hung himself upside down from the piece of rope .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . A man whose girlfriend refused to marry him because of his 'too small' penis decided to travel the world and talk with men, women and medical experts in a bid to answer the age-old question 'does size matter?' Patrick Moote, 30, based in Los Angeles, California, filmed all of the conversations he had in destinations including New York, Taiwan and Papua New Guinea, and pieced them together to create a hilariously thought-provoking documentary titled Unhung Hero - out now on DVD. Explaining why he decided to make his 'less-than-average size member' a public concern, Mr Moote told the New York Post: 'I’ve always gone after things I’m . insecure about head on [and I] saw an opportunity to answer a question that I . think was bothering a lot of guys and  . . . me.' Scroll down for video . Feeling rejected: Patrick Moote's girlfriend refused to marry him because of his 'too small' penis - so he decided to travel the world in a bid to answer the age-old question 'does size really matter?' 'Even when I was . telling people about it, I never felt like I was embarrassing myself . that much. It was almost like doing a service for men in general.' Mr Moote's one-hour,-24 minute-long film sees him battle humiliation and confusion as he candidly addresses his body hang-up. He even contacted former girlfriends to get their verdict on his 'package'. On a scale of one to ten, one ex gave it a 'three' and another politely admitted, 'It could [have been] bigger'. Caught on camera: A YouTube video of Mr Moote's failed proposal scored over ten million hits . Honest and open: Mr Moote filmed all of the conversations he had in destinations including New York and Papua New Guinea, and pieced them together to create a hilariously thought-provoking film titled Unhung Hero . While the woman Mr Moote lost his virginity to recounted it as an unmemorable experience, where she apparently didn't feel a thing. 'I don't remember much, I thought we were just making out,' she says. Meetings with medical specialists confirm that Mr Moote has a 'below normal' size penis. Refusing to give the exact size away, Mr Moote told Rolling Stone magazine: 'I did a lot of measuring, and anyone who's done it enough knows that there's anywhere from an 1/8 to 1/4-inch fluctuation on any given day. 'It's such a fickle creature. But if you . were to say that the average penis is around five-and-a-half inches, I'm . below average' 'It's such a fickle creature. But if you were to say that the average penis is around five-and-a-half inches, I'm below average.' However, over a series of interviews with women on the street, Mr Moote was comforted by the fact that while size is an issue for many, it's not a huge one. Recalling their responses he said: 'You either get, ""Oh my God, no! That would never be a problem,"" or ""Oh yeah. Big time. That's a big problem."" It's almost fifty-fifty.' He discovered that being 'too big' can be just as much of a problem. In New York he spent an afternoon with Jonah Falcon, who has the world's largest penis, to get a different view on things. But the full-time actor and comedian says the film isn't just about penis size and is about embracing all kinds of insecurities. An education: On his travels he learned about various methods people use to make their penises bigger . Shared knowledge: He also talked to men and women about their own sexual experiences . 'After some screenings, people told me . they relate to it but never had a penis, or seen a penis . . . But they . get it. They understand. Maybe when they were younger they felt like . they didn't fit what everybody wanted them to be. 'And as soon as they accepted the fact that they are who they are, their life changed astronomically. I love that.' Others who watched his film would open up to him about their own 'weird' sexual experiences with current or part partners. 'Nowadays, there’s just as much pressure . on men in terms of body image, who you’re supposed to be, and what . you're supposed to look like' 'It’s really cool to see people . let their guard down like that,' he said. In his film Mr Moote also looked at the lengths some men go to make their penises bigger. The Taiwanese offered the most dramatic remedies with turtle testicles and reptilian liquor sold as natural enhancers. One man Mr Moote met tied and lifted 350lbs from the end his manhood in a bid to elongate it. He gave the bizarre practice a shot with 5lbs but did not recommend it. In Papa New Guinea, he learned of an 'enlarging' oil injection and in Korea he was introduced to Dr. Yoo-Soo  Lee, an esteemed penis enlargement pioneer. He removes fatty tissue from the abdomen of his patients and inserts it into the penis for a natural, enhanced look. Mr Moote hopes his film will inspire more men to talk openly about their manhood. Trying all avenues: One man Mr Moote met tied and lifted 350lbs from the end his manhood in a bid to elongate it - he gave the bizarre practice a shot with 5lbs but did not recommend it . 'I think it’s a conversation people should have. People are so terrified to talk about it, but something we got into a lot is that all men are insecure about it. 'Nowadays, there’s just as much pressure on men in terms of body image, who you’re supposed to be, and what you’re supposed to look like.'

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Three mounted police officers came to the aid of a reporter in Chicago yesterday, after a protester grabbed the microphone to rant about the President. Jay Levine had been reporting on a visit to Chicago by President Obama when a man rushed into front of the camera, and started yelling. Although CBS cut its live 5pm broadcast at that moment, the incident was caught on camera by NBC Chicago, which also had a news team reporting in the area. Scroll down for video .

Shock: NBC 5 reporter Mary Ann Ahern was distracted from her broadcast by the ruckus . Levine, the chief correspondent for CBS in Chicago, was giving a live report on the imminent arrival of Obama to a fundraising event when a man in a hooded top suddenly barged into him. In footage of the event, shown by Gawker, the man grabbed the microphone and yelled: 'Obama is a war criminal'. As Levine's broadcast was cut, the feed from NBC's Mary Ann Ahern picked up the aftermath of the protest. At first Ahern tried to continue with her report on the President's schedule, but as the war protester's cries became louder both she and the cameraman turned to look at the unfolding chaos. Scuffle: The protester is pushed to the ground while a shaken-looking Levine looks on . Back up: With a mounted police escort behind him, Levine returns to finish his piece to camera . The NBC cameraman filmed as an unidentified man held the protester to the ground while a shaken Levine looked on. With the protester contained, but still calling out, CBS resumed its broadcast, but with its reporter surrounded by three mounted police officers. 'I've obviously got a little reinforcement here,' Levine quipped as he continued his broadcast. Footage of the protest, taken from the two networks, was later put on YouTube.","Jay Levine was being filmed talking about presidential visit when he was knocked out of the way .

"By . Jonathan Petre . Restaurants have been ordered by the Government to serve smaller portions in the name of healthy eating – while charging customers the same amount to make themselves a healthy profit. The aim is to cut calories in curries and pizzas and reduce customers’ waistlines. But critics say customers will be left with lighter wallets too. Advice on the Department for Health website suggests cutting the size of pizzas and curries in order to cut calories and boost restaurant profits by keeping the same price . The Department of Health advice, which it posted on its website, states: . Italian restaurants should  cut an inch off the width of a pizza, saying: ‘You will save money by using less dough and toppings.’ It adds: ‘Thinner bases – bigger profits!’ Indian takeaways should scrap free poppadums and use smaller containers as ‘smaller portion sizes will still be satisfying and will save you money!’ Chinese restaurants can reduce the amount of salt in their food. ‘Customers won’t notice if you do this gradually.’ Fish and chip shops should use thick chips that absorb less fat which ‘can save calories and cut costs’. Sandwich shops can reduce the size of fillings. ‘Use grated cheese instead of sliced’ and if customers ask for a spread, ‘spread it thinly’. Fish and chips shops have been asked to use thick chips which absorb less oil and 'can save calories and cut costs' Chefs are also told to use single instead of double cream and fresh chilli instead of chilli oil. There is even a ‘money bag’ symbol on the department’s site highlighting health-promoting tips which will also boost the profits of food outlets. But critics question whether the Government should be encouraging restaurants to offer customers less value for money, even if its motivation is to improve the nation’s health. Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, a GP who is on the health select committee, said the tips to reduce portions were ‘sensible advice’ as the obesity epidemic is now so serious. But she added: ‘I can understand, however, why some object to the phrasing of the advice and that this should be done specifically to boost profits without customers’ knowledge.’ The money bag symbol appears five times in the two-page document for chip shops, along with the advice: ‘Use thick, straight-cut chips. These absorb less fat, so you use less oil and it’s healthier for your customers. Make your chips using a cutter with at least a 14mm (just over half an inch) cross section.’ MP Sarah Wolaston, a GP on the health select committee called the tips 'sensible' given the obesity epidemic . There is also a money bag symbol by the suggestions for sandwich shops to use grated cheese. It states: ‘This can mean you use less cheese and it will add volume to your sandwiches.’ They are also told to put salad in every sandwich as a ‘good way’ of ‘using less of the expensive filling like meat and fish’. Italian restaurants are told: ‘Healthier eating is becoming more and more important to customers. Follow these tips to ensure you stay ahead of the market and increase profits!’ The advice continues: ‘Cheese and meat can be expensive as well as high in fat and salt, so be sparing when adding these ingredients and be generous with vegetable toppings. ‘Customers won’t notice if you add a tiny bit less and you will save money!’ Indian outlets are exhorted: ‘Don’t serve poppadums free of charge as these can add a lot  of fat and calories to a meal.’ But Ranjit Mathrani, chairman of Britain’s largest group of Indian restaurants including Chutney Mary in Chelsea, West London, said while he supported cutting obesity, the guidelines were ‘reprehensible’. He said: ‘The idea of cutting portion sizes and charging the same is unethical. It is unethical and disreputable and likely to backfire because it is encouraging restaurants to pull a fast one over customers.’ The Responsibility Deal initiative, chaired by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, which is designed to pressure the food industry into producing healthier products, has already led to chocolate bars shrinking in size while staying the same price. Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies last week admitted the average man and woman is now overweight. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Research shows that overall we are eating more than we should, so controlling portion sizes and reformulating to use less fat, salt and sugar is an essential part of the Responsibility Deal. ‘Many small businesses don’t have the technical knowledge to make the right changes – these tips are designed to help them serve healthier food.’","Advice on Department for Health website suggests cutting portions .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Former New York Yankees outfielder Chad Curtis is being investigated for possible ‘inappropriate touching’ involving four female students in a Michigan school where he worked as a volunteer. The 43-year-old old, who was expected to become the head football coach at Lakewood High School this fall, has been suspended from his duties as a weight-room attendant pending an investigation into the allegations. Curtis also worked as a substitute teacher in the Lakewood School District located in Barry County. Probed: Former Yankees outfielder Chad Curtis (pictured) has been accused of 'inappropriate touching' involving four female high school students . According to the website Mlive.com, Schools Superintendent Michael O'Mara said district officials were notified a week ago by a Barry County sheriff's detective about the investigation. Mentor: Curtis volunteered as a weight-room attendant at Lakewood High School, and was supposed to be hired as the school's head football coach . So far, no criminal charges have been filed against Curtis, who has denied the allegations. ‘I don't believe I touched any students inappropriately...I care about my community,’ Curtis told 24 Hour News 8. ‘I care about my students.’ Curtis, who is a devout Christian, also asked his community to pray that the case ‘would be resolved in a way that is honoring god’ as the legal process runs its course. Ousted: Chad Curtis was fired in 2009 from his job as an athletic director at NorthPointe Christian Schools in the Grand Rapids area . Curtis previously was the athletic director at NorthPointe Christian Schools in the Grand Rapids, Iowa, area from 2007 to 2009, at which point he was dismissed for reasons that have not be clearly stated. At the time, Curtis said he lost the job because of differences with the administration. Winner: Curtis is best known for hitting the walk-off home run in the 10th inning of Game 3 of the 1999 World Series against the Braves . Superintendent O’Mara said before Curtis was allowed to work with Lakewood students, a background check was performed, and it came up clean. Curtis spent parts of ten seasons in the majors with the Angels, Tigers, Dodgers, Indians, Rangers and most notably with the Yankees, where he won two World Series rings before retiring in 2001. He is probably most remembered for hitting the walk-off home run in the tenth inning of Game 3 of the 1999 World Series against the Atlanta Braves.","Chad Curtis volunteered at Lakewood High School before being suspended .

"By . Martin Robinson . A devoted husband whose wife has been convicted of trying to murder him said today: 'I still love her and always will'. Christine Houston, 66, used a cravat to throttle her disabled partner Stewart, 56, and only failed to kill him because a Sainsbury's driver arrived to deliver their weekly shop. Afterwards she told police she 'didn't have a . gun and didn't like knives so strangling was all she could think of', Newcastle Crown Court heard. Heartbroken: Stewart Houston was strangled by his mentally-ill wife Christine at home but he says he will always love her and she should never be blamed for what happened to him . Happier time: Mr and Mrs Houston have been married for 28 years - pictured in 2010 - but her conviction for attempted murder, which he never supported, means that she will never be allowed home again . But Mr Houston said today his full-time carer wife was 'failed' by the NHS who released her from a secure unit on two separate occasions despite her telling staff she wanted to 'suffocate him'. 'They kept this from me and sent her home to care for me 24 hours a day. She was failed by them. There is no chance she should have come home,' he told MailOnline. Mrs Houston has admitted attempted murder and yesterday was told at Newcastle Crown Court she would be detained indefinitely in a mental hospital. The heartbroken couple, who are still 'devoted' to each other, shared a hug afterwards before she was taken away to custody. They will never be allowed to be together without supervision. Mr Houston said: 'She is a loving, caring person. She is as gentle as a lamb. ‘I still love her and always will. She has cared for me selflessly for many years and made huge sacrifices in her life. ‘She . was badly let down by people who should have cared for her. I believe . that none of this would ever have happened had she been kept in. ‘We speak on the phone four to five times a day and I see her around four times a week. ‘It . is sad because she will never be allowed to come home again and we will . never be able to spend time together without supervision’. Attempted murder: Christine Houston, left, was . interrupted while trying to murder her husband Stewart, right, both outside court, by the . arrival of a shopping delivery. Mr Houston says she . shouldn't have been prosecuted . Saved: Mrs Houston was in the process of trying to kill her husband when their shopping from Sainsbury's arrived (file picture). Afterwards she carried on as if nothing had happened, her husband said . Mr Houston, who suffers from muscular . dystrophy and is wheelchair bound, was left with blood spotting behind . his eyes and marks to his neck as a result of her attack on May 26 last year. The attack only stopped when a Sainsbury's shopping delivery arrived and interrupted them. But he says she should never have been prosecuted for trying to kill him. 'I was sitting in my wheelchair when Christine came up from behind me and put the cravat round my neck,' Mr Houston said. Bereft: Mr Houston has described how his wife Christine came from behind and throttled him with his cravat having repeatedly told professionals she wanted to harm him . ‘It went on for at least ten minutes or more. She did not say anything at all during it. When I could I asked her to stop. I was very scared. ‘It . was a terrible situation to be in. I did not want my life to end. But I . was also scared for Christine because if she managed to kill me I . thought one day she would realise what she had done and try to harm . herself. ‘Then the food delivery arrived and she stopped, shut the . door and took in the food. He knew nothing about it at all. She came back and it was as if nothing had happened’. Shortly . after taking him to the toilet she called the police. She told them: ‘I . have tried to kill my husband and I am a horrible person’. Mr Houston blames the NHS for what happened, claiming the people who cared for her in a County Durham knew she wanted to hurt him and failed to tell him each time she was released. He also says that social services failed to offer him enough care, meaning his unwell wife was expected to look after him round the clock despite having severe mental health problems. Mrs Houston has bipolar and 'psychotic episodes' meaning she can have hallucinations. Wedding day: Stewart and Christine met in 1984 and then married in September 1985. But as his health deteriorated his pharmacist wife was forced to give up work and care for him full time . Troubled: Mrs Houston had suffered from mental health problems from her early twenties but 'psychotic' episodes she suffered became worse in recent years, leading to her being taken into hospital on several occasions (pictured in 2004) The couple, who are devout Christians, have been married for 28 years and met through church in Chester-le-Street. - Stewart Houston, whose wife Christine tried to kill him . Mr Houston says the authorities maintained she was not a risk because she had not made any 'direct threat to kill', he claims. Mr Houston said days before she strangled him: ‘she wrapped a pipe round my neck for three seconds and told me: ""You realise how bad I am"" but then she stopped'. The attempted murder has been linked . to 'carer's fatigue', where a person snaps through the pressures of . looking after a loved one. Christine's husband says she was put under incredible pressure to look after him. He . said after she tried to kill him he was left to look after himself from . 1pm to 10pm each day, and social workers would leave glasses of water . around the house with long straws in them so he could stay hydrated. Mr . Houston then spent three months in hospital after failing to care for . himself. It was only in November 2012 when he was given a 24-hour help . at home. Tragic: Mr Houston's wife was taken away from their County Durham home by police in May 2012 and told them: 'I tried to kill him, I wanted him dead' Contact: The couple will never be able to spend time alone again and they speak on the phone at least five times a day . Sentencing: Mrs Houston was told yesterday she would be detained indefinitely in a mental hospital at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday . A spokesperson for Tees, Esk and Wear . Valleys NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We appreciate how distressing this . must be and we are sorry that Mr Houston has concerns about his wife’s . care.  We would encourage him to get in touch with us so we can look . into his concerns.' Lesley . Jeavons, head of adult care with Durham County Council, said: 'We will . not go into detail about individual cases but can confirm we have not . received any complaints from Mr Houston about the care package he . receives. We will be contacting him to find out the details of his . complaint and how he wishes to resolve matters. We take all complaints . very seriously'. Mr Houston has said he he hopes to launch legal action against both authorities and the county council because he blames them for what has happened to his wife. 'I am not able to get legal aid and do not have much money so fear I may not be able to', Mr Houston said.","Christine Houston, 66, admitted the attempted murder of husband Stewart .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 37-year-old man missing for nearly a year has been found dead by his ex-wife under the stairs of an Alaska home they had rented out. Samuel Ephram McAlpine was reported missing on March 29 last year by his sister after failing to return home from a date. But on Monday, McAlpine's ex-wife Christine Elizabeth McAlpine discovered his body in the home they owned on the 17000 block of Meadow Creek Drive in Eagle River as she prepared the property for new tenants. Police believe McAlpine, who was known to disappear for weeks at a time, had secretly crawled into the home before it was rented out and passed away. The cause of death is not known. Tragic: Samuel Ephram McAlpine, 37 (pictured left in 2011 and right in about 1993 when he was much younger) had been missing for nearly a year before his ex-wife found his body under the stairwell of a home they owned . Police spokesperson Anita Shell told Alaska Dispatch McAlpine re-entered the home a few days before it was rented out last year. The Alaska native was going through a divorce at the time. 'What he had done was go back into the home, and he had crawled into the area under the stairwell, a little area under the stairs used for storage, and...that is where he died,' Shell said. Anchorage Daily News reported the storage space underneath the stairs had been blocked by a three-foot-tall door. Police believe drugs and alcohol factored into his death, and don't suspect foul play. Alaska Dispatch reported the renters, who were both part of the military, moved in and were not aware that a man was dead under the stairs. Scene: McAlpine's ex-wife Christine Elizabeth McAlpine discovered Samulel McAlpine's body in their home on the 17000 block of Meadow Creek Drive in Eagle River, Alaska (pictured) on Monday . Shell said it wasn't clear if the renters spent much, if any, time in the home. 'I donâ€™t know how often they were at the house,' she said. 'Obviously this would have started to smell relatively quickly. I donâ€™t know if they were deployed; I donâ€™t have those details.' A year after the tenants moved in, McAlpine's ex-wife entered the home to prepare for potential new tenants and 'noticed a foul odor'. That's when she discovered her ex-husband's body. An autopsy is being conducted to determine an official cause of death. News Miner reported that in October 2011, McAlpine pleaded no contest to a charge of felony drug possession. A warrant was issued for his arrest when he did not report to jail.","Samuel Ephram McAlpine found dead by his ex-wife Christine Elizabeth McAlpine on March 31 .

While many of the coffee mega-chain's detractors who believe it to be the antithesis of authentic coffee may not be surprised, Baton Rouge teacher Megan Pinion was most definitely upset. So annoyed was Pinion to be handed two drinks with a satanic pentagram and 666 etched atop on the Day of the Lord, that she took to Facebook to air her fury. Satanic outrage: These are the two coffees handed to Megan Pinion which caused her to express her fury on Facebook to Starbucks . 'I unfortunately can't give the young man’s name who served it, because I was so appalled that I could not bring myself to look at him,' Pinion wrote in her post according to the Louisiana Advertiser. 'I am in no way judging his beliefs or dis-meriting his beautiful artwork, I am however judging his lack of professionalism and respect for others. Not impressed: Megan Pinion received a full and unreserved apology from Starbucks for the satanic coffees served up to her by a barista . 'I am a teacher in the public school system and if I were to present a child of atheist or pagan believers with a Christian art project I could be sued in a heartbeat. 'I am of Catholic faith and would love to share in my beliefs daily. Fortunately I have enough common sense to present myself with professionalism and follow an ethics code.

This obviously is not the . type of experience we want to provide any of our customers, and is not . representative of the customer service our partners provide to millions . of customers every day.'

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Next time a man smiles at you be on your guard - you could be about to make yourself submissive. Research has found that all men need to do is flash a grin at a woman and she is more likely to do what he asks. In three experiments researchers looked at how a man’s smile impacted on a woman’s perception of him and her body language. Men can charm women with a simple smile, researchers say. Research has found that all men need to do is flash a grin at a woman and she is more likely to do what he asks . When the man was in a dominant role - in the experiment he gave them instructions - women obeyed him more often if he grinned at them. This was the case even if he said a blatantly sexist statement afterwards. The study by the University of Granada in Spain also found that women assumed a more narrow and submissive posture when a man smiled at them. The researchers concluded that the man’s ‘perceived warmth’ was the reason for the woman’s behaviour. Women who do not want to be manipulated by a man's smile, especially when they are at work, is to know what you want before meeting men . Body language expert Patti Wood said that the findings were troubling but that it could be because women rely on body language more than men to make decisions. She said: ‘Even if there's dissonance between what's been said and what his body is doing, women will look to the body. ‘If they see a smile, then the interaction seems more friendly. ‘It's a tricky situation, and one that highlights just how subtly sexism can intrude on interactions. ‘Even if there's dissonance between what's been said and what his body is doing, women will look to the body. ‘If they see a smile, then the interaction seems more friendly.’ Miss Wood’s advice to women who do not want to be manipulated by a man’s smile - especially when they are at work - is to know what you want before meeting men. She said that this will improve your body language and communication and reduce the number of nervous tics that reveal your anxieties. Another of her tips is to watch yourself - stop avoiding eye contact and stop smiling too much yourself. Miss Wood, who is based in the US, said: ‘Smiling can make women seem more subordinate.‘If you're smiling when giving an important statement, it makes that statement weaker.’ She also advises that women be aware of their behaviour in general and to not just look at a man’s body language. Miss Wood said: ‘Think through the verbal message before you respond. ‘If he says something sexist and you smile or shrink, it means he can get away with it.’","Spanish experiment looked at how a man’s smile impacted on a woman’s perception of him and her body language .

"By . Matt Rocheleau . Man's best friend is the mailman's worst nightmare. The United States Postal Service has halted mail delivery to dozens of homes in a Cedar Rapids, Iowa neighborhood because a small, unleashed Chihuahua mix has been terrorizing their local mailman. 'The dog has interfered, on a number of . occasions with the delivery of the mail in that particular . neighborhood,' USPS spokesman Richard Watkins told KCRG. Scroll down for video . This small dog has been terrorizing a local mailman prompting the USPS to suspend mail delivery until it is properly leashed . The owner of the small Chihuahua mix holds the troublesome dog while talking to a local TV reporter. 'It's a nice dog,' he said. 'Once we know that . the dog owner has taken responsibility and making sure that dog is not . running free in the neighborhood, the mail delivery will continue,' he added. The canine's owner, Guillermo Tellez, contends its friendly. 'It’s a nice dog,' he said. But, some others side with the postal service's characterization of the pooch. Alyssa Taylor, who lives next door, said her family has been attacked by the dog. 'We . got chased a couple times just bringing in our groceries into our house . in our own driveway,' Taylor said. 'We called animal control at that . point and they did come and seize the dogs because it did not have its . vaccines up to date.' Owner Guillermo Tellez says his Chihuahua mix is friendly, 'a nice dog.' But others, including his next door neighbor disagree . 'Two weeks later my five-year-old was bit in the back of the leg in our own backyard,' she added . City officials said animal control workers visited the home twice last summer, including once when a dog was bit by the child.

"By . Emma Innes . A father who was left infertile as a teenager has defied the odds to have three ‘miracle’ sons - thanks to his father who encouraged him to freeze his sperm. Antony Allen, 41, was heartbroken at the age of 17 when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and had to undergo 12 months of life-saving chemotherapy. Doctors told Mr Allen, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, the treatment would leave him infertile and his father, Les, advised him to freeze his sperm. Antony Allen, 41, has had three 'miracle' sons - Charlie, now 13, Jonah, now five, and Bobby, now two - despite being made infertile by cancer treatment as a teenager . After 24 years of check-ups, website director Mr Allen has finally been given the all-clear and is now the proud father of three sons, Charlie, 13, Jonah, five and two-year-old Bobby. All three of his children were born following fertility treatment and Mr Allen has thanked his father for advising him on what was the ‘best decision of his life’. Mr Allen said: ‘I owe my dad a debt that I can never repay. ‘Grateful doesn’t even come close to how I feel when I look at my boys and think about what might not have been. ‘I had a very good relationship with my old man but at the same time, he was very laid back and when possible always let me and my brothers and sister make our own choices and to learn to live by the consequences. ‘Every now and then though, his foot would come down and this was one of those times and I’m so lucky he did.’ Mr Allen (pictured with his wife, Sarah) battled leukaemia as a teenager and doctors warned him the treatment would make him infertile. His father, Les, encouraged him to freeze some sperm before starting treatment . Mr Allen says that now, when he looks at his sons, he is incredibly grateful to his father for his advice . Mr Allen says his father (pictured with grandson, Charlie) was usually laid back but he occasionally put his foot down and insisted on something. He says that Mr Allen freeze his sperm was one of the things he insisted on . As a teenager, Mr Allen often struggled to get to grips with the illness, even falling asleep at school on one occasion due to tiredness. Despite receiving treatment on a regular basis, he was determined to live a normal life and enjoy his teenage years. He said: ‘I was a typical very busy teenager with plenty going on and growing up with the illness was fine, apart from side effects of the chemotherapy. ‘I refused to let it get in the way of my teenage years so when I was well enough, I went to the pubs and parties like everyone else did, except for two or three days after each chemo session. ‘This probably wasn’t the wisest thing but I wouldn’t be told, just like every other 17-year-old and as a result, it was my parents who suffered as all they did was worry, in a good way of course. Mr Allen said: 'I owe my dad a debt that I can never repay. Grateful doesn't even come close to how I feel when I look at my boys and think what might not have been' Mr Allen (pictured with his wife, Sarah) had to have check ups for 24 years after his cancer treatment . ‘The big thing back then was that teenage cancer victims had no special support. ‘Young kids had the children’s wards and older people were happy on the general wards but teenagers were almost overlooked. ‘When you consider what else is happening to kids of that age - bodies changing, exams, peer pressures of all kinds - life is hard enough. ‘With cancer it was even harder as you felt isolated by the system but these days it is totally different thanks to people like the Teenage Cancer Trust.’ Mr Allen is finally celebrating with his wife Sarah, 36, after more than half a lifetime of cancer check-ups and has gone on to set up his own youth club after his dreams of becoming a social worker were dashed due to his illness. Mr Allen has now fulfilled his dream of becoming a youth worker - years after the dream was dashed by cancer . Mr Allen (pictured with his wife and children) had his three children using fertility treatment . He commented: ‘My intention was always to be a social worker and work with young people but the cancer took that away from me. ‘But after much planning, I started my very own youth club called i-Macclesfield Youth Club. ‘We’ve been open just over a year now, getting over 200 11 to 16-year-olds coming through our doors every month with a volunteer network of over 20 local adults. ‘Such has been our success we’ve won four awards for our work with young people in the community and I’m about to complete my BTEC in youth work which I have been studying for on a part-time basis. ‘So despite everything, after 24 years, I have finally been able to fulfil my dream of being a youth worker, albeit part time & voluntary, and am helping local young people every week.’","Antony Allen, 41, suffered from Hodgkin's lymphoma as a teenager .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Britain’s railways could be taken back into public ownership if Labour wins the next election. Ed Miliband revealed he is examining ‘innovative solutions’ which could see the government replace the likes of Virgin, First and Stagecoach in running trains across the country. The idea, backed by two-thirds of voters, would create a major dividing line with the Tories who have rushed to privatise the East Coast line. Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured on a train with shadow chancellor Ed Balls, said any plan to renationalise the railways had to be affordable . The East Coast line has been run by the state-owned Directly Operated Railways since the Labour government took it over in 2009 when National Express walked away from the franchise. Since then it has returned more than £600million to the Treasury and has seen passenger satisfaction soar. However, the coalition plans to return the line to a private firm by February 2015. But Mr Miliband accused the government of being motivated by ‘dogma’, against public ownership of major industries. He suggested that a future Labour government could take other lines back into state control when franchises expired. ‘We are interested in innovative solutions when it comes to the railways. It's got to be affordable. That is absolutely definite,’ he told The Guardian. ‘The experience of East Coast, which has been in public hands, has been a good experience. ‘The government is dogmatically wanting to privatise East Coast. I don't think you should approach this issue with dogma on either side. So we are interested in innovative solutions.’ The Flying Scotsman service was reintroduced by the government-owned Directly Operated Railways on the East Coast line . The idea was this week backed by Unite . general secretary Len McCluskey, who said the public wanted to see the . railways back in state control. A YouGov poll last year showed 66 per cent of people wanted to see the railway companies run in the public sector. It included 52 per cent of Tory voters and 79 per cent of Labour supporters. Last year ministers spent £1million preparing to take charge of the West Coast main line from Whitehall before resorting to pleading with Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin trains to continue running his trains. Five civil servants drew up a plan for the lucrative line from London to Scotland to be renationalised after the collapse of the franchise competition which had been won by Virgin’s rival FirstGroup. But as the clock ticked down to the December 9 deadline when Virgin was due to be kicked off the London to Scotland line, ministers were forced to ask Sir Richard to stay on while they find a more permanent solution.","Labour looking at 'innovative solutions' to running the railways .

"By . Luke Garratt . A schoolgirl who became stuck in a drain while trying to retrieve her iPhone has defended her decision to squeeze down the narrow gap to grab it. Ella Birchenough, 16, said that nobody dissuaded her from the idea, as she pulled up the heavy drain cover weighing 22 kg (around 3 stone) to retrieve her two-week-old iPhone 5S, which she was unaware was insured. Miss Birchenough said: ''I could reach the floor of the drain, so when I got pulled out I went back in. Nobody said don't do it, they were just looking at me as though I was nuts.' Scroll down for video . The teenager became caught in the storm drain in an attempt to retrieve her phone - the part of the storm drain she picked up apparently weighed 22 kg . After unsuccessful attempts from friends and family, as well as many, many cameraphone pictures, firefighters were eventually called to hoist her out . Eyewitnesses to the event claimed that . while the incident on Eaves Road in Dover, Kent, was embarrassing, she . remained in high spirits throughout. In an interview with ITV's Daybreak, Miss Birchenough continued to explain how she came to get stuck in the drain, and how the original pictures, which went viral, were actually taken by her mother. She said: 'I dropped the iPhone down the drain, and tried reaching for it, but couldn't get it. 'In the end, I couldn't pull myself out.' Miss Birchenough appeared on ITV's Daybreak with her friend Tim Richards, 22, who attempted to help her out of the drain, to defend her decision . Miss Birchenough made it clear in the interview that most of the people around her during the event saw the funny side, including her mother, who she said took the original picture . Her mother and her friend had been responsible for the original picture, which has become a sensation around the country, being posted on Facebook, after her initial panic turned to amusement. Miss Birchenough said: 'She rounded the corner as white as a sheet, and then started laughing and took a photo.' Tim Richards, 22, an eyewitness and friend who came to her rescue after seeing Miss Birchenough in the drain on a drive with his mother, said how situation was unique. He said: 'She was in high spirits, with a smile on her face, which you certainly don't expect to see on a girl stuck down a drain. Her friend Tim Richards (right) was driving past when he saw his friend trapped in the drain, before hopping out because he 'needed to take a picture' 'When I saw her I said to my mum ""Stop the car. I need to take a picture of this."" 'We did try and pull her out, but after a while in there she had no upper body strength.' Miss Birchenough also said how she was going to manage 'horribly' without her iPhone for the time being. And after the retrieval attempt garnered Miss Birchenough much embarrasment, it has been revealed that it was all for nothing, as the iPhone 5S, which was on a contract, was broken completely. Her mother, Mrs Birchenough, has since joked that she will be bringing out the pictures of her daughter in the drain on her 18th birthday and wedding day. Ella-Anne Birchenough, 16, managed to squeeze down the small drain on her street in Dover, Kent . Taxi firm worker Mrs Birchenough, 36, said: 'I think it's the funniest thing. At first I panicked, thinking ""Oh my God, she's going to sink"". 'But when I saw her it made me laugh. She is upset about her phone, but at the end of the day at least she's alright.' While Miss Birchenough has been able to see the funny side, some eyewitnesses were not so amused, with one calling the event 'pure stupidity' Eyewitnesses to the event had mixed opinions about the entire situation, with some seeing the funny side, and others branding Miss Birchenough's dip into the drain deeply irresponsible. One eyewitness said: 'It was pure stupidity, seeing the size of the girl, she shouldn't have gone down the drain in the first place. It could have been a lot worse than it was. Another said: 'I don't think I'm going to see something like that again in my entire life. 'I hope I do, because it was amazing.' Kent Fire and Rescue issued a statement that said: 'We're really happy that there was a good outcome and that Ella was able to laugh about it. 'But obviously with the recent weather a number of things could have washed down drains - she didn't know what was underneath her, it could have been unstable. 'We'd urge people to think carefully before trying to retrieve their objects.' Kent County Council said: 'This event does just go to show how clean our drains are, that she managed to open the drain without it getting stuck on muck and grime.'","Ella Birchenough, 16, says nobody dissuaded her from entering the drain .

Abuser: Dan Kirby Kopp, 45, would routinely beat his wife for being 'disrespectful' and not addressing him as 'sir' A Pennsylvania man has been found guilty of beating his wife with a wooden spoon because she did not address him as 'sir'. Dan Kirby Kopp lashed out at his wife when he found her 'disrespectful' towards him in front of their children. The 45-year-old from Ephrata, Pennsylvania would routinely beat his now-estranged wife with the spoon or his hand, a court heard.

"By . John Hall . A koi carp named Chadwick has finally returned to his pond after escaping during a flood two months ago and turning up in a river seven miles away. Staff at Romsey World of Water in Hampshire noticed the the two-foot long chagoi koi was missing along with and a sturgeon named Steve after water from the flooded River Test overwhelmed the aquatic centre in February. While Steve was discovered in a puddle in a nearby petrol station a few weeks later, staff thought they were unlikely ever to see Cahdwick again - until a dog walker reported seeing the distinctive fish swimming in the River Test near Totton - a staggering seven miles from where he escaped. Home: Chadwick the koi carp finally returned to his pond after escaping during a flood two months ago and turning up in a river seven miles away . Adventure: Chadwick (right) escaped from Romsey World of Water in February. The acquatic centre's manager Mark Bradbury (left), said: 'It's a fantastic story, no one could believe where Chad had ended up' Making a break: Staff at Romsey World of Water in Hampshire noticed the the two-foot long chagoi koi was missing when water from the flooded River Test overwhelmed the aquatic centre in February (pictured) Staff at the centre say Chadwick and Steve have become 'inseparable' after their travels. Following the escape, a wide search resulted in Steve being found at an Esso garage just one mile from Romsey World of Water. And almost two months after fleeing the aquatic centre, Chadwick was finally located by a walker who recognised the distinctive fish swimming in the River Test. Chadwick was thrown bread by people who were walking past the Salmon Leap pub in nearby Totton while his owner was called to the scene. Chadwick had swum a staggering seven miles - crossing roads and industrial estates to get to his final location. Distance: Chadwick was eventually founding swimming in the River Test near Totton - a staggering seven miles from the aquatic centre . Getaway: Chadwick and a sturgeon named Steve escaped from the Hampshire aquatic centre when it flooded during the winter storms . Dry again: Chadwick has now returned to Romsey World of Water after a dog walker spotted him in the River Test and phoned the manager. The centre has now returned to normal following the floods (pictured) He even lost one pound in weight during his epic journey - with the 10-year-old fish now weighing just nine pounds. The pair sparked a search when the aquatic centre's lake was overwhelmed by the winter floods in February, allowing both fish to swim away. Staff at the aquatic centre thought Chadwick - who is nicknamed Chad - was unlikely ever to be found, despite repeatedly hearing about sightings. Centre manager Mark Bradbury, 53, said: 'It's a fantastic story, no one could believe where Chad had ended up. We didn't think we would get him back, but when he was eventually spotted, we all breathed a huge sigh of relief.' 'Chad is such a fantastic fish, he's so friendly and everyone who visits the centre knows him and has missed him over the last two months. He's been at the centre for seven years and everyone recognises him, he added. Hunt: A search was launched after the two fish escaped. This resulted in Steve the sturgeon being found in a puddle at an Esso garage just one mile from Romsey World of Water . 'People think of fish as not being very . sociable, but chagoi koi carp are very friendly and very tame... Chad has . such a strong personality and will always approach people when they . come close to the water - he's the most popular fish here,' Mr Bradbury went on . to say. Mr Bradbury says Chadwick was finally located after a woman contacted him to say she had seen the fish swimming in the River Test and recognised him from the 'missing' posters that the aquatic centre had put up. 'When he left he weighed ten pounds, but he has lost one pound because of all of the swimming,' Mr Bradbury said. 'He's like an athlete now - when he left he was more of a couch potato, but now he's such a strong swimmer,' he added.","The two-foot long chagoi koi fled Romsey World of Water during a flood .

Another giant rat has been trapped by pest control after terrorising an Irish family in south Dublin, in what is just the latest case of 'monster vermin' in residential areas. The 24inch monster rodent had been terrorising Grace and Ian Walters’ home in Kingswood shortly after they moved into their new flat. Pest control were called in but despite luring the large rat into a trap, it was so big it had to be removed by hand. Scroll down for video .

Giusti, of Total Pest Control, said it was one of the biggest rats he . has ever caught, but agreeing with recent reports from the UK and . Europe, he says the pests are growing bigger and their numbers are . swelling too. ‘I think it’s a lot to do with climate and hygiene,’ he told Irish Independent. ‘If . people leave their household bins overflowing and in disarray, they are . essentially creating a food source for these animals.’ ‘We really weren’t anticipating the rat would be that big. The trap didn’t have any impact on him so we had to stick our head up where the speaker was located and remove it that way,’ he told independent.ie.

Last month the 19inch Viking-rat of Solna, Sweden, made news around the globe after it was found in a flat in suburban Stockholm. Earlier this year, pest control experts warned that rats are mutating and developing an immunity to tradition poisons. The pesticides wipe out weaker animals, meaning that those that survive are able to withstand increasing amounts of poison.","Giant rodent caught in the home of family in Dublin, Ireland .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Tiger Woods has been pictured for the first time since undergoing the back surgery which put him out of the U.S. Masters for the first time in 20 years. The 38-year-old golfer looked sombre as he sat in the passenger seat of a car driven by his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn on Wednesday, two days after his operation in Utah. The sports star and his beau both wore sunglasses for their drive with Woods displaying several days stubble growth. Health troubles: Tiger Woods is pictured with girlfriend Lindsay Vonn leaving a Florida hospital on Wednesday after undergoing back  surgery . Woods said on his website on Tuesday that he had surgery Monday in Utah for a pinched nerve that had been hurting him for several months, knowing the surgery would keep him from Augusta National next week for the first time since he was in high school. The No. 1 player in the world is a four-time Masters champion. 'After attempting to get ready for . the Masters, and failing to make the necessary progress, I decided in . consultation with my doctors to have this procedure done, Woods said. 'I'd . like to express my disappointment to the Augusta National membership, . staff, volunteers and patrons that I will not be at the Masters. Disappointment: Tiger Woods will miss the Masters because of back surgery - his back has become increasingly troublesome and the golfing legend spoke last month at the World Golf Championships about the agony he was going through . 'It's a week that's very special to me,' he said. 'It also looks like I'll be forced to miss several upcoming tournaments to focus on my rehabilitation and getting healthy.' The Masters gets the highest television ratings of any golf tournament, and while Woods last won a green jacket in 2005, he commands most of the attention. He won his first Masters in 1997 when he set 20 records, from youngest Masters champion (21) to his 12-shot margin of victory. Woods has been coping with back issues since last summer — a twinge in the final round of the PGA Championship, spasms in the final round of The Barclays that caused him to fall to his knees, and then it returned with alarming regularity during the Florida swing. He withdrew after 13 holes in the final round of the Honda Classic with what he described as lower back pain and spasms. Beginning of a legend: Masters champion Tiger Woods receives his green jacket from the previous year's winner Nick Faldo in 1997 - he has won four Masters titles . Agony: Tiger Woods grimaces after teeing off on the 12th hole during the final round of the Cadillac Championship golf tournament in Doral, Florida and pauses for a moment at the 17th hole on March 9 . Woods shot the highest final round of his career at Doral a week later when he said his back flared up again in the final round. He skipped the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he was the two-time defending champion, to rest his back and do everything possible to be at Augusta National next week. He said he had a microdiscectomy for the pinched nerve, performed by neurosurgeon Charles Rich. A microdiscectomy is a type of minimally invasive spine surgery to relieve pressure and pain caused by a herniated disc. Upsetting: Tiger Woods looks down during a news conference at the Newseum in Washington, Monday, March 24, 2014 when discussing his ability to compete at this years Masters tournament in Augusta, Georgia . Unsteady: Woods injured his Achilles after playing from under the Eisenhower tree at the 2011 Masters . Operating through a small incision in . the lower back, surgeons remove small disc fragments that are pressing . against spinal nerves. Recovery . can take several weeks and doctors typically advise against bending and . twisting the back until patients are completely healed . 'This is frustrating,' Woods said. 'But it's something my doctors advised me to do for my immediate and long-term health.' Woods said he hopes to return to golf . this summer, though he could not say when. It's possible he could at . least start chipping and putting in three weeks. His website said Woods could have sustained more damage if he had continued to play. Crocked: Woods withdrew from the Players in 2011 . after nine holes, left and the American played through the pain barrier . on his way to winning the 2008 US Open . Carted off: Woods is driven off the course after picking up a neck injury at the Players in 2010 . He will have to wait until the U.S. Open — maybe longer — to resume his quest to reach Jack Nicklaus' record 18 professional majors. Woods won his 14th major at the 2008 U.S. Open on a badly injured left leg that required season-ending surgery two days after his playoff win at Torrey Pines. He has not won another major since then. Woods has 79 career wins on the PGA Tour, three short of the record held by Sam Snead. He . already was off to the worst start of his career. He missed a 54-hole . cut at Torrey Pines, where he was the defending champion. He tied for 40th in Dubai, and then withdrew from the Honda Classic and tied for 25th at Doral. Racking up the green: Woods won the Masters in 2005 . Last triumph: Woods stands with runner-up Rocco Mediate after winning the US Open in 2008 after a play-off at Torrey Pines . Nice fit: Woods adjusts the Masters green jacket in 2002 after his win at Augusta . Silver service: Woods looks at the British Open trophy after his win in 2005 . 'It's tough right now, but I'm absolutely optimistic about the future,' Woods said. 'There are a couple (of) records by two outstanding individuals and players that I hope one day to break. As I've said many times, Sam and Jack reached their milestones over an entire career. I plan to have a lot of years left in mine.' The recovery time is listed as two to . three months before that usually happens, which would clearly leave him . in a race against time to be ready for the meat of the summer programe. Then there’s the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in September. To . play in that, he would almost certainly need a wild card and while . captain Tom Watson would be happy to hand him one if he has fully . recovered, would a man who has undergone such an operation really want . to be on a course in the heat of competition for as many as 12 hours a . day? 1995 - Withdraws from US Open on sixth hole of his second round after injuring left wrist playing out of heavy rough . 2002 - Had his second knee surgery to drain fluid around his left ACl and remove a number of cysts . 2007 - Ruptured his ACL running on a golf course, however, plays through the pain for the season . 2008 - Undergoes surgery on his left knee after the Masters in April . 2008 - Wins US Open in June, despite being told he had two stress fractures in his left tibia . 2010 - Neck problems down his right side forces him to withdraw from the Players . 2010 - Reveals he had a cortisone shot to help ease 'lingering soreness' in his Achilles in December . 2011 - Sustains a minor sprain to his left Achilles playing from under the Eisenhower tree at the Masters . 2011 - Withdrew from the Players for the second consecutive year after Achilles, knee and calf problems . 2012 - Driven off the course on the 12th hole of March's final round of the WGC at Doral after more pain in his left Achilles . 2014 - Withdraws from the Honda Classic with back problems . Whatever happens, this is unquestionably another massive blow for Woods, who has been blighted by one injury after another in his thirties. The most serious came in 2008, when he tore his anterior cruciate knee ligament and was out of action for eight months. He has also withdrawn from events owing to his achilles and a bad neck. In 2011, he failed to tee it up at the US Open and the Open because of an Achilles complaint. It is all a far cry from 12 months ago when he returned to the top of the world rankings with an eighth career victory at Bay Hill and third of the season. This was supposed to be the year when Woods got back on the majors trail after a drought stretching back almost six years. Now the future looks more uncertain than ever.

Vodafone would pay those premium rate lines for the calls before billing the genuine customer, whose only knowledge of the fraud would be that their own phone had ceased to operate.

Three of the gang were tried at Blackfriars Crown Court following a four-year investigation by South Yorkshire Police and were convicted of conspiracy to defraud yesterday. Nadeem Ali, 26, (left) travelled abroad and used SIM cards to call international numbers.  Waseem Rashid, 26,  (right) , gave his own details when obtaining a SIM card from a mobile phone shop and provided the details of another person to obtain a SIM which was later linked to 47 hijacks . Traditionally thieves have made money by simply selling stolen phones . on to someone else, but increasingly organised gangs rent premium rate telephone numbers. They then use stolen phones or move across legitimate phone numbers to their SIM cards to call those premium numbers . repeatedly. In this case the four men pretended to be Vodafone customers when they called up the mobile phone network and requested the phone numbers of genuine Vodafone customers be assigned to SIM cards they had. It is not clear how they managed to pass the security checks. They then used the SIM cards to repeatedly call premium rate lines they had purchased, which typically had connection charges of around £2.50 per call. Vodafone would pay those premium rate lines for the calls. They would then bill the genuine customer, whose only knowledge of the fraud would be that their own phone had ceased to operate. Some bills received by genuine customers were in excess of £80,000. Waseem Rashid, 26, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, gave his own details when obtaining a SIM card from a mobile phone shop and provided the details of another person to obtain a SIM which was later linked to 47 hijacks. Imran Rasab, 35, of Mexborough, South Yorkshire, was behind a company which purchased thousands of mobile phone customer details from marketing companies. He was found in possession of SIM 'gateway' equipment with multiple card slots, used to dial several phone numbers at the same time. Nadeem Ali, 26, of Rotherham, travelled abroad to France and the Netherlands. During the trips, SIM cards were used to call international numbers and these SIM cards were linked to hijacked customers of Vodafone. Kaleem Hussain, 30, of Rotherham, had previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud. All four defendants will be sentenced on April 11. Detective Constable Mark Wootton of South Yorkshire Police, said: 'The conspiracy was organised and highly effective and as a result some victims received bills in excess of £80,000, which must have come as a shock. 'Vodafone rightly and properly helped pursue these criminals.' Mark Hughes, Vodafone's head of security, said: 'We take any fraud against our customers very seriously and had no hesitation in vigorously pursuing these individuals to get justice for the victims and to prevent others from being defrauded.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Pennsylvania high school student is expected to file a lawsuit against his school district after he was allegedly sexually assaulted by his former teacher. A March 21 letter from the student's attorney, Susan L. Luckenbill, to Wyoming Valley West School District Superintendent Charles Suppon was obtained by The Citizens' Voice through an open records request. The student's name as well as those of his parents were redacted by the district. The student 'is a victim of sexual assault and was a minor at the time of the assault,' the letter alleges. It also claims that the student suffered 'damages and injuries' due to negligence from district employees and former teacher Lauren Harrington-Coooper, 31, 'on or about October 2013 through December 2013.' Harrington-Cooper, center, was surrounded by reporters as she entered the court after her first arrest in December . Lauren Harrington-Cooper, seen here with her husband Raphael Cooper, has been charged THREE times relating to inappropriate contact and relationships she allegedly had with four male students . On December 19, the Voice reports Harrington-Cooper, 31, was charged with having sexual intercourse twice and oral sex three times with an 18-year-old student one week in mid-December. The 18-year-old student's sister told him that Harrington-Cooper texted her that her brother was 'hot,' according to the complaint obtained by the paper. The victim got Harrington-Cooper's cell phone number from his sister and reportedly texted her later that day. On January 9, Harrington-Cooper was also charged with having oral sex in a parked car with a 17-year-old student in November. Her relationship with that student began when she told a female student that the boy was attractive, the paper reports. The male student left her a note with his cell phone number and she allegedly sent him sexually explicit text messages. Lauren Harrington-Cooper, seen here with her husband, even allegedly showed one student a butterfly tattoo on her right breast . On January 28, Harrington-Cooper was charged a third time for making inappropriate contact with two other male . students, who were 16 and 17 at the time of the alleged crimes. Those relationships reportedly began in October 2012 and continued after her arrest, the paper reports. Harrington-Cooper and the 17-year-old student met in a shopping center where they kissed and fondled each other in a car, according to an earlier report. The boy reportedly said he felt uncomfortable because they were not in a private area. The 16-year-old boy said Harrington-Cooper was his teacher in both seventh and eleventh grades, and that he was 'trying to make it happen' for the 17-year-old student. The 16-year-old also reportedly told authorities that there was a 'certain vibe' in his text message conversations with Harrington-Cooper and that he could have had sex with her anytime he wanted. When he was a junior, Harrington-Cooper reportedly invited him to her house multiple times and showed him a tattoo of butterfly on her right breast. Harrington-Cooper allegedly told the 16-year-old student about problems within her marriage and that if she and the student lived together 'they would have fun.' Harrington-Cooper waived her right to a preliminary hearing on Thursday. On January 22, the school board had accepted her resignation from her post. She is free on $50,000 bail, the paper reports. MailOnline earlier reported that Harrington-Cooper is married to Raphael Cooper, owner of Cooper Dance Academy. On December 19, Raphael Cooper he told the school's students and their parents that classes were cancelled due to 'a family emergency' via Facebook. Later that evening, he wrote: 'After the holiday, I, Raphael Cooper will address all of the members of our studio as to our future. Please keep everyone in our family in your prayers as we confront the days ahead.'","Student expected to sue Wyoming Valley West School District .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Barred: Vicky Haigh, 43, was jailed for approaching her daughter in 2011 after a bitter custody battle. She is now barred for three years and cannot challenge the ruling in that time . A former jockey and racehorse trainer has been banned from going near her daughter for three years - and cannot challenge the ruling until 2017, a High Court judge ruled. Vicky Haigh, 43, was first barred from the ten-year-old girl in 2011 after she falsely accusing her former boyfriend, the father of her child, of being a paedophile during a bitter custody battle. She was then jailed for three years when, weeks later, she approached the child in a petrol station. Today, Family Division judge Mrs Justice Hogg set up a 'no go zone' around the child identified only as 'X'. Ruling the measures were a means of 'protecting' the little girl, she also banned Ms Haigh from making any more court applications for three years. She said further litigation was 'not conducive to peaceful existence. Litigation is anxiety making.' She added: 'It is not good for a child to be the subject of litigation, and after eight years it really has to come to an end for X’s sake.' In August 2011, at the height of the custody battle between Ms Haigh and David Tune, also 43, then-Family Division President Sir Nicholas Wall ordered her to be unmasked and be named and shamed as he branded the 'scandalous allegations' a 'pack of lies'. He said they were made up by Ms Haigh, who had also 'coached' her daughter to make the false claims. He said the couple should be named to clear Mr Tune of the child abuser smears. She now has a second daughter 'R', by a new partner, who will be three in May. In December 2011 she was jailed for three years for defying court non molestation orders forbidding contact with X. Ms Haigh's jail sentence in December 2011 came after she approached the girl in her father’s car at a petrol station near Doncaster, and opened the door to talk to her. She had the sentence reduced to two years and three months and was initially released on licence from prison in September 2012. But after attempts to get X to attend her half sister’s christening she was returned to prison for breaching the terms of her licence. She was freed again in May last year. Smear: Ms Haigh's internet campaign branding former partner David Tune a paedophile was branded a 'scandalous pack of lies' by the judge, who ordered for her to be named and shamed . In December last year, she was back in court after she attempted to make contact with X by sending her a birthday card, and was given a conditional discharge. The local council Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council started care proceedings as long ago as 2006 and X has lived with her father since. Initially, Ms Haigh was allowed contact but that stopped after she launched her email and internet campaign against Mr Tune. They returned to court this month to seek the exclusion zone around X’s home, school, the secondary school she hopes to go to, as well as her paternal grandmother’s home where she spends a lot of time. The judge said X had been spoken to by a social worker for her views, and offered birthday cards and gifts from her mother, half sister, and maternal grandmother. But she said she did not want them. She told the social worker the best thing in her life was 'living with Daddy'. Ms Haigh, who now has another daughter by a new partner, tried to get her daughter to attend the younger child's christening, and also tried to send her a birthday card . She said : 'That is awesome, she was happy and wished for things to stay the same.' As . for Ms Haigh, the judge said: 'The mother throughout these proceedings . has not and never has accepted the findings in the original care . proceedings. 'She does not accept that she coached her child to tell lies about sexual abuse. She does not accept that she has behaved inappropriately in any way, and has a very firm view that she is innocent, as she puts it, of any crime, that she and X are being punished.' She added: 'She wants contact and cannot . understand why she has been prevented. 'She would like her two daughters . to know each other and believes it is in their best interests for that . to occur.' She wants contact and cannot . understand why she has been prevented . - Mrs Justice Hogg . She added: 'Fundamentally the mother does not understand and can see no reason why she cannot see her daughter. 'She believes that no contact is not in her daughter’s interests, and is detrimental to her contrary to her and her own Human Rights and respect for family life, and contrary to the interests of her own younger child who is X’s half sister.' The judge said she had taken the views of the mother and X into account and decided that X does need protection from her mother. The exclusion zone was necessary 'to protect X from a deliberate or accidental meeting by the mother with her daughter.' She said it is there 'to protect X and to give X some peace of mind, and that is what she needs.' She said when the exclusion zone comes to an end in 2017, there may be a different situation. 'It may be that X will have her own views, maybe the mother will have come to a different view about the past.' Banning Ms Haigh from making further applications over the next three years, she said of X: 'She needs to be able to continue her life with her father, do well at school, she has the 11-plus coming up, and I hope very much she will do well and get to the school that she wants. 'If there were further litigation this could deflect her from what is otherwise prospective success.'","Vicky Haigh falsely called partner David Tune 'paedophile' in custody battle .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A former New York University professor and outspoken advocate for women's empowerment has been arrested for allegedly stalking and harassing her ex-lover, chief Citigroup economist Willem Buiter. According to police officials and court documents, Dutch economist and educator Heleen Mees, 44, sent Buiter - a married father of two - more than a thousand emails over the course of two years, which included photos showing Mees pleasuring herself and other sexually explicit images. Missives from Mees to the world-renowned economist allegedly contained threats as well as sexually charged language. Fatal attraction: Ex-NYU professor Heleen Mees (left), 44, was arrested and charged with stalking and harassment counts for allegedly sending her former lover, Willem Buiter, 63, (right) a barrage of emails . 'What can I do to make it right? Shall I lick your b***s?' Mees allegedly wrote to her paramour. In another letter cited by The New York Daily News, the 44-year-old ex-adjunct professor at NYU's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service allegedly suggested that she and Buiter adopt a child. Mees was taken into custody just before noon Monday and arraigned today on multiple stalking and harassment charges. She was ordered held on $5,000 bail. Mees' attorney, Vaneshka Hyacinthe, claimed that her client 'had a long-standing relationship' with Buiter and 'the emails go in both directions.' A Manhattan judge ordered the 44-year-old economist to avoid all contact with Mr Buiter and his family. It is believed that the married 63-year-old economist and the Dutch NYU professor once had an intimate relationship, but at some point it ended. 'Hope your plane falls out of the sky,' the embittered Mees wrote to Buiter, according to court documents. Threatened: Mees allegedly sent harassing messages' to Buiter's wife, economics professor Anne Sibert (pictured), and the couple's two children . Buiter, a native of the Netherlands, is married to economics professor Anne Sibert, and the couple have a 22-year-old son and a 19-year-old daughter. Mees, who is fluent in five languages, including Mandarin and French, was assistant professor in economics at Tilburg University and a researcher at the Erasmus School of Economics in the Netherlands. Her area of expertise is monetary policy and emerging economies. It is believed that the brilliant economist and vocal advocate for the advancement of women in the workplace has become obsessed with her distinguished lover. Court papers filed in the case against Mees paint a portrait of an unhinged woman who bombarded Buiter with a slew of increasingly bizarre and disturbing emails between July 1, 2011 and Monday, including one sent May 3 that included an image of dead birds. Mees even dedicated her PhD dissertation to Buiter and thanked him for being 'so kind' to meet with her in the summer of 2008 in London, according to the New York Post. According to the court filings, the 44-year-old alleged stalker also harassed Buiter's wife and children despite her ex-lover's repeated requests that she stop her barrage of messages. On February 27, Mr Buiter sent Mees a cease and desist letter, but that did nothing to deter the lovesick professor, who proceeded to fire off several hundred more emails to him, according to court documents. Willem Buiter has chaired the World Economic Forum and was on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. In 2010, he was hired as Citigroup's chief economist. Over the past three decades, Buiter had taught economics at some of the world's most prestigious institutions, including Princeton, Yale and Cambridge universities. His wife currently teaches at University of London's Birkbeck college.","Emails contained threats, sexually-charged language and sexually explicit images .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Rats as big as cats have been scouring the streets of Birmingham, breaking holes in walls and ravaging bins, reports claim. Pest control has gone into overdrive to tackle more than 5,100 sightings of the enormous animals in the city just one year. Colin Watts, managing the crackdown, said he saw a two-foot rodent as 'wide as a brick'. Outbreak: Pest control has been sent into overdrive to find and catch two-foot rats swarming Birmingham . Giant holes have been made into homes, and calls to pest control were up by 300 on the year before in 2013 . He said: 'One of the biggest I've seen must have been 14 or 15 inches long. 'That was just the body, without the tail. 'With its tail it would have been over 2ft. It was like a small cat.' One professor blames the obesity epidemic and households' unhealthy diets for fuelling the pests' appetite and eating habits. Dr Robin Allaby, professor in evolutionary genetics at Warwick University, said: 'Humans have got bigger with nutrition and it's a quite likely explanation for rats as well.' Colin Watts, who has been dealing with the outbreak, says they weigh the same as two bags of sugar . Mr Watts added that some rats felt as heavy as two bags of sugar. 'They're unbelievably big and heavy when you pick them up,' he said. 'It's because of all the food around for them in bags. 'They are definitely getting bigger.' Earlier this month, councillors objected to plans to privatise Birmingham's pest control service, which they claim would make the essential service too expensive for residents. The service must become self-sufficient within two years so Â£600,000 can be cut from the budget. Mr Watts is urging families to lay poison and warning rats reproduce at an alarming scale. One professor at Warwick University blames households' increasingly large eating habits for fuelling the rodents' diets . Officers had suggested outsourcing the service and increasing charges. Young rats can fit into a hole the width of a large pen as their spines were like 'jelly'. Sexually active and reproducing at just six weeks of age, rats have up to 12 babies at a time. In a lifetime of around 18 months, they can have approximately 200 offspring. Mr Watts said: 'Imagine the knock-on effect, it's incredible. 'So it's imperative we keep putting poisons down in Birmingham.' Ratzilla: Rats in Papua New Guinea can reach the size of a large tom cat, such as this one pictured in 2007 . There are several species of rat classed as 'giants' - most of them from South America and Indonesia. The coypu - a large rodent which grew up to 2ft long and weighed 20lbs - is found in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa. It is similar to a beaver and lives in water and in burrows on river banks. It was believed to have been made extinct in the UK in 1989 after it became a pest and caused damage to river banks and irrigation systems. Several species of giant rat bigger than some cats were discovered in 2007 in remote jungle areas on Papua New Guinea. The largest, known as woolly rats, can reach 3ft long. In South America, there are two types of giant rat from the Kunisia genus. They grow to more than 1.5ft and feed on insects and other mammals. The news Birmingham comes just days after a 16in 'ratzilla' was found in a flat in Sweden, which sparked a frenzy on Twitter. The . picture of the enormous rodent, which had been caught in a rat trap, . broke into the kitchen by gnawing its way through cement and wood. Meanwhile, in Germany, residents of Halle were this week terrified by the discovery of 'demon' rats with fangs in their central river. In the UK, pest control officers were forced to hunt down a swarm of two-foot rats in Bradford in 2010. And last . year, exterminators were baffled by rats who chewed through heavy duty, highly-protected wires in Southampton - sparking a massive . blaze that caused thousands of pounds of damage at a coach company. The fire destroyed three coaches and three minibuses at the firm's headquarters.","Two-foot rodents breaking holes in walls, ravaging bins in Birmingham .

"By . Katie Nicholl, Mail On Sunday Royal Correspondent . She's done a remarkable job of overseeing her family’s rise up the social ladder – but these pictures might give Carole Middleton something to be a little anxious about. For they show that her son James, the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger brother, is still in a relationship with TV presenter Donna Air – ‘a single mother from Newcastle’, as some commentators snobbishly sniped. The pair were inseparable for much of last year, but when they spent Christmas apart it triggered reports that their relationship had hit the rocks. However, Donna and James – who are just coming up  to their first anniversary – have laughed off rumours of a split. Still together? James Middleton (left) and Donna Air (right) enjoyed a relaxed rendezvous at his west London office on Friday before leaving separately, pictured - including with Ella, the sister of Kate's cocker spaniel . They enjoyed a relaxed rendezvous on Friday at James’s West London office – and these exclusive photographs show them venturing out separately to take James’s dog Ella – the sister of Kate’s cocker spaniel Lupo – for a walk. They slipped out of the base of James’s baking company Nice Cakes, which is above a sushi  restaurant in South Kensington,  moments apart, before joining up for their first public outing together since early November. They met at a dinner party in February last year and became a fixture at showbiz bashes, but at the tail end of last year, Donna, 34, attended several without her 26-year-old toyboy, first prompting reports of a split. The couple also spent the festive period apart. James decamped to the £4.5 million family manor house in Bucklebury, Berkshire, for Christmas with mum Carole, a former air hostess, dad Michael and sister Pippa and – later – Kate, William and six-month-old Prince George. Meanwhile Donna returned to Newcastle to spend Christmas with her family before heading to Goa and Kerala in India for some  New Year sunshine with Freya, her ten-year-old daughter with her  ex-partner – the 53-year-old casino-owning multi-millionaire environmentalist Damian Aspinall. A source close to James told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘People were saying they’ve split because they haven’t been photographed for a while but they are still together and everything’s good.’ And a friend of Donna’s – who is soon to launch her own jewellery range – added, ‘They will have been together for a year soon. They are as happy as ever and have laughed at reports their relationship is over.’ As well at being regulars at various London members’ clubs last year, the pair were also spotted out clubbing with James’ sister Pippa and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. Last September, Donna told The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine: ‘James is wonderful .  .  . And yes, there is also the bonus that he  brings something I have always searched for and will always need in my life... cake.’ Meanwhile, another picture of James has just been made public – as a photograph of him as a teenage at Marlborough College has been posted on Facebook by his old school pal James Simison.

"By . Liz Hull . Tears: Kathleen Thompson gave evidence on the fourth day of fresh inquests in Warrington . The wife of a train guard who died in the Hillsborough disaster made a tearful plea to jurors last night to ‘let my children know their father was not a hooligan’. Kathleen Thompson was left as sole carer of three sons and two daughters when her husband Pat was crushed to death at the football ground in April 1989. Yesterday she broke down as she revealed only her two eldest children, Patrick and Sean, have any memories of their father. The boys were five and four respectively and the couple also had two-year-old Katie and twins Rebecca and Brendan, nine months old at the time. She said she wanted them to know her husband, who died aged 35, was a devoted family man. Mrs Thompson, 57, was giving evidence on the fourth day of fresh inquests into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans at the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. She and relatives of other victims hope the court will eliminate once and for all any suggestion that fans’ behaviour played a part in the disaster. Mrs Thompson told the jury: ‘Hillsborough robbed the children of their father, a man so proud to have been at the birth of each of them. 'The thing that hurts the most is that the children have limited memories of their father.’ She said they had grown up listening to ‘constant’ stories about Mr Thompson from other family members. ‘Even now my children love their dad so much,’ she said. ‘All they want is justice for their father. ‘Please listen to the evidence and let my children know that their dad was not a hooligan but a hard-working family man who just happened to love football.’ The hearing in Warrington heard the . first of a series of short biographies or ‘pen portraits’ by the loved . ones of those lost in the disaster, reducing some jurors to tears. Wilf . Whelan, 71, father of 19-year-old Ian Whelan, told the court that on . the ‘fateful’ morning of the tragedy his eldest son, who worked as a . clerk for British Nuclear Fuels, had called at his girlfriend Joanne’s . home and left two red roses on her doorstep as a surprise. Horror: The disaster left 96 football fans dead and several hundred injured - but they were initially blamed . ‘He wasn’t a football hooligan,’ Mr Whelan said. ‘He even attended Mass of his own free will every Sunday without fail. 'My family feel that they have had to defend his good name for the last 25 years.’ The older brother of victim Paula Smith, 26, revealed they were only able to get one ticket for the match, so he gave it to her and went to work instead. Walter Smith added: ‘I often think if I’d been there with her she would be here today. … my mother never got over Paula’s death, she was heartbroken, as was my father.’ The inquests, which began on Monday, were ordered after the 1991 inquests’ verdicts of ‘accidental death’ were quashed following publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel’s inquiry in December 2012. Aftermath: One father said he had to spend 25 difficult years defending his son's good name .

"By . Laura Clark . Every parent should be issued with a ten-point checklist of skills that their children must master before their first day at school, the head of Ofsted said yesterday. Sir Michael Wilshaw warned that too . many youngsters have been starting their education unable to use the . toilet, follow simple instructions or even make themselves understood. Launching Ofsted’s first report into early-years education, he said that while many parents ‘intuitively’ teach children vital skills, others fail to do so, condemning their offspring to struggle at school. Sir Michael Wilshaw warned that too many youngsters have been starting their education unable to use the toilet, follow simple instructions or even make themselves understood (stock picture) And he claimed that a list of ‘essential skills’ – such as sitting still, listening and understanding the words ‘no’ and ‘stop’ – would help parents ensure their children were equipped to start primary school classes. He also demanded more places for two-year-olds at school-based nurseries, particularly for poorer youngsters, to help them catch up with their wealthier peers. Addressing childcare professionals in London, Sir Michael revealed that across the country, only a third of youngsters from low-income backgrounds reach key development milestones by the age of five. He said: ‘The poorest children are less likely to be able to follow instructions, make themselves understood or manage their own basic hygiene. ‘By age five, many children have started reading simple words, talking in sentences and can add single numbers. But far fewer of the poorest children can.’ Sir Michael went on to attack the ‘middle-class’ idea that structured learning is damaging for young children. He criticised the ‘chattering classes’ who believe children should be free to enjoy themselves without being required to learn. ‘Let us not pander to those who think childhoods are being stolen,’ he said, adding: ‘It is a middle class prejudice for which some of the most disadvantaged pay the price.’ But early years consultant Nancy Stewart told Sir Michael: ‘There is a lot of evidence about what counts in children’s later success and it is not putting on your shoes and going to the toilet, or even being able to  recognise your name. ‘It is things like being confident, being curious and motivated. 'We need to be careful when we look at what are we saying are the essential things to be ready for school but also to be life-long learners.’","Sir Michael Wilshaw said too many children start education unprepared .

The last words from the cockpit of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane before it disappeared were actually 'Good night, Malaysian three seven zero,' not 'All right, good night' as Malaysian authorities had previously claimed. It is not clear whether the sign off was said by Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah or his co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, but it was transmitted as the plane left Malaysian airspace and was about to enter that of Vietnam at 1.19am on March 8. The cause of the discrepancy is unclear, but for three weeks it was reported that 'All right, good night' had been said by co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid two minutes before the planeâ€™s transponder was shut down.

Today the Department of Civil Aviation in a short statement: 'We would like to confirm . that the last conversation in the transcript between the air traffic . controller and the cockpit is at 0119 (Malaysian Time) and is 'Good . night Malaysian three seven zero.' 'The . authorities are still doing forensic investigation to determine whether . those last words from the cockpit were by the pilot or the co-pilot,' said the statement. The statement added that acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein 'has instructed the investigating team to release the full transcript' which will be made available during the briefing to the next-of-kin of passengers on board the flight, which disappeared on March 8. Today it was announced that Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak will visit Australia to witness the race-against-time bid to locate a crash site for flight MH370, as a ship equipped to pinpoint its 'black box' prepared to steam to the search area. Ships and planes from seven nations scanned a vast zone far off western Australia for yet another day, but the hunt for debris that would prove the Malaysia Airlines jet crashed in the Indian Ocean more than three weeks ago turned up nothing.

Malaysian officials attend a briefing for the relatives of Chinese passengers onboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 as pictures of Emergency Locater Transmitters are shown during a presentation at a hotel in Beijing . 'The prime minister, who is going to Perth on Wednesday, will be briefed fully on how things have been conducted, and probably will be discussing what are the chances ahead,' Malaysian Transport and Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters in Kuala Lumpur. Experts warn debris must be found within days to nail down a crash site in order for any use of the US-supplied black box detector - known as a towed pinger locator (TPL) - to be feasible. The US Navy, which has supplied the detection device, said in a statement Monday: 'Without confirmation of debris it will be virtually impossible to effectively employ the TPL since the range on the black-box pinger is only about a mile.' But Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said earlier in the day no time limit would be imposed on the search for clues as to what happened. 'We owe it to the families, we owe it to everyone that travels by air, we owe it to the anxious governments of the countries who had people on that aircraft. We owe it to the wider world which has been transfixed by this mystery for three weeks now,' Abbott said in Perth. The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people vanished without a trace on March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, leaving stunned relatives, the aviation industry, and ordinary travellers around the world hanging on the mystery. Could THIS be part of MH370? A picture taken on board a Royal New Zealand P-3 Orion shows a piece of unknown debris floating just under the water during the search for the missing plane in the Indian Ocean . Mystery: A picture taken off a computer monitor shows a piece of the debris which has not yet been identified. The image has been sent off for analysis . Drawing a blank: A Chinese aircraft returns to Perth International Airport after searching for the missing jet . Families of Chinese passengers have angrily attacked Malaysia, alleging incompetence and deceit in what even Malaysian officials call the 'unprecedented' loss of a jumbo jet. More than a dozen Chinese relatives - part of a group of nearly 30 who arrived on the weekend to press for answers - kept up the pressure after a prayer session Monday at a Kuala Lumpur Buddhist temple. 'We will never forgive those who hurt our families and don't tell the truth and delay the rescue mission,' a spokesman for the group, Jiang Hui, told reporters, reiterating suspicions toward Malaysia voiced by many relatives of the 153 Chinese aboard. The Australian vessel Ocean Shield, fitted with the pinger locator and an underwater drone designed to home in on the black box's signal, was to conduct sea trials off Perth on Monday before heading to the search area. No time limit for the search: Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott addresses members of the international forces currently based in Perth searching for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . Hope has been lost: Tony Abbott defended the Malaysian prime minister's announcement that there was no hope for all on board the missing flight, saying all the evidence pointed to the plane going down in the southern Indian Ocean . Mr Abbott said his main reason for visiting the RAAF base was to thank the personnel who have come to help with the search. He is pictured here shaking hands with China's Air Force Senior Colonel Liu Dianjun, head of China's effort to locate the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . A black box signal usually lasts only about 30 days. Fears are mounting that time will run out - Ocean Shield will not reach the search zone, now the size of Norway, until Thursday, Hishammuddin said, roughly 26 days after the plane went missing. If floating MH370 debris is found, authorities plan to analyse recent weather patterns and ocean currents to determine where the plane went down. Malaysia believes MH370 was deliberately diverted by someone on board and that satellite data indicates it crashed in the remote Indian Ocean. Monday's search saw ten planes take to the skies, with ten ships already at sea. Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia, South Korea and the US are taking part. Malaysia remains officially in charge, but Australia has assumed increasing responsibility, appointing retired air chief marshal Angus Houston to head a new coordination centre in Perth. Many Chinese relatives, still holding out slim hopes, have taken issue with Najib's March 24 announcement that the plane was lost at sea, despite the lack of firm evidence. Hishammuddin said 'high-level' Malaysian officials and experts involved in an investigation into MH370 would brief families simultaneously in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing 'soon' in a bid to explain Malaysia's stance. Malaysia insists it is being transparent, but is yet to release any details of its investigation into what happened, which has included probing the backgrounds of everyone on the flight, including its crew. Chinese aircraft spotted three new objects floating off the western coast of Australia, as they scoured the new search area today. The items were said to be red, orange and white - similar to the colours of a Malaysia Airlines jet. This picture shows a suspected item of debris highlighted . Several objects have been spotted from search planes. This map shows the planned search area for Monday . In testy exchanges with foreign journalists Monday, Hishammuddin said: 'We are not hiding anything, we are just following the procedure that has been set.' Malaysia also has come under fire from China's state media, while Beijing has pressed for more transparency in the investigation. Authorities there allowed angry relatives to stage a rare protest last week at Malaysia's embassy. But a commentary in the government-controlled China Daily struck a more measured tone Monday, urging relatives to accept their losses. 'Although the Malaysian government's handling of the crisis has been quite clumsy, we need to understand this is perhaps the most bizarre incident in Asian civil aviation history,' it said.","Admission came in statement from Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation .

"By . James Salmon . Probe: City watchdogs will look at high-interest cards dubbed 'payday loans with plastic' The £150billion credit card market is to be investigated amid fears that nine million vulnerable customers are trapped in a spiral of debt. City watchdogs will look at high-interest cards – dubbed ‘payday loans with plastic’ – and controversial no-interest deals that come with hefty penalties for those who miss a repayment. The Financial Conduct Authority probe comes amid concerns that 18 per cent of  UK adults are vulnerable as they have too much debt. FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley accused some lenders of pushing struggling households further into the red by dishing out credit cards. He said more than a million customers pay off only the minimum of their balance each month. Many so-called ‘survival borrowers’ are juggling multiple cards and struggling to cope with their bills. Mr Wheatley added that firms providing credit would have to examine ‘fundamental questions of culture, ethics, business models and the like’. The investigation, to be launched later this year, is the FCA’s first major act since taking responsibility on Tuesday for regulating around 50,000 ‘consumer credit’ firms, including payday lenders and debt management companies. But banks, building societies and other credit card providers will also fall under its scope. Investigators will look into whether firms are selling suitable products to customers, whether the costs of credit are made clear at the outset, and how they deal with those who fall behind on repayments. One area likely to face scrutiny is the sale of hugely popular zero per cent balance transfer deals on credit cards. Concerns: Almost a fifth of Britons are vulnerable because of high levels of debt, according to figures (file photo) As a ploy to attract new customers, . some banks offer interest-free periods of up to 31 months on their . debts. But the downside is those who miss a payment or do not pay in . full once the interest-free period comes to an end can be hit with . swingeing penalties. Mr Wheatley also warned that consumers are being given the equivalent of ‘plastic pay day loans’ – high-interest credit cards with low credit limits of a couple of hundred pounds. These tend to be offered for specialist lenders that cater for customers with poor credit records, such as Vanquis Bank. He said: ‘Why are card issuers providing the means, in some cases, for the most indebted consumers to escalate their way into further debt?’ Consumer campaigners  welcomed the probe. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Too many credit cards appear to be designed to catch customers out.’ FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley questioned why so many people in debt are offered more credit . James Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance, said: ‘The customers who end up paying hundreds of pounds in interest and charges are those who can least afford it.’ The regulator has the power to fine firms up to 10 per cent of annual sales. It can also refer the matter to the Competition and Markets Authority, which could break up companies. About 56million credit cards are issued to around 30million UK customers, with £150billion spent on plastic last year. The total outstanding balance   stands at £57billion. Meanwhile, 8.4million households have no savings, warned the FCA. Richard Koch, head of policy at the UK Cards Association, said: ‘The industry has a long-standing commitment to responsible lending and transparency.’","Financial Conduct Authrity to probe high-interest cards with hefty penalties .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A secret 'Cuban Twitter' that swept the communist country was set up and funded by the White House to 'inspire dissent', it has emerged. ZunZuneo, local slang for 'tweet', drew in more than 40,000 users in just two years as the nation continues to limit free internet use. Today it has emerged the project, launched in 2009, was covertly funded by the US Agency for International Development - and American contractors were gathering subscribers' personal data for political purposes. Scroll down for video . Revelation: More than 40,000 Cubans were using ZunZuneo, a secret Twitter created for the communist country, without knowing it was funded and monitored by the US, gathering their information . Aid: The $1.6 million project, which evaded Cuba's strict internet stranglehold, was described by the US Agency for International Development as a 'basic humanitarian assistance' It is unclear whether the scheme was legal under US law, which requires written authorisation of covert action by the president and congressional notification. Publicly launched in 2009, Zunzuneo was branded a 'basic humanitarian assistance' in a USAID memo. It was stopped abruptly in 2012 when the government fund ended. The Cuban government has a tight grip . on information, and the country's leaders view the internet as a 'wild . colt' that 'should be tamed'. But ZunZuneo's . leaders planned to push Cuba 'out of a stalemate through tactical and . temporary initiatives, and get the transition process going again toward . democratic change,' according to a 1,000-page document obtained by Associated Press. They hoped the network would reach . critical mass so that dissidents could organize 'smart mobs' - mass . gatherings called at a moment's notice - that could trigger political . demonstrations, or 'renegotiate the balance of power between the state . and society,' the documents reveal. Launched in 2009, memos reveal its creators hoped to 'trigger political demonstrations' and 'smart mobs' Cuba has a tight grip on information and leaders view the internet as a 'wild colt' to be tamed. In 2009, US contractor Alan Gross was jailed for trying to give Cubans internet using the government's exclusive access . Users' messages were screened to gather information such as gender, age and 'political tendencies' Users' messages were to be screened, tracking information such as gender, age, 'receptiveness' and 'political tendencies'. Ernesto Guerra, a Cuban user in Havana who never suspected the network . had ties to Washington, said: 'It was such a marvelous thing. How was I supposed to realize that? 'It's not like there was a sign saying, ""Welcome to ZunZuneo, brought to you by USAID."" 'The moment when ZunZuneo disappeared was like a vacuum.' The launch of Zunzuneo came months after the arrest and imprisonment of American contractor Alan Gross, who had been on a covert USAID mission to expand Cuban internet access using technology that only governments can use. But according to newly-revealed memos, its creators were banned from divulging Washington's involvement in the venture. Saimi Reyes signed up to the free messaging network in 2009, unaware of its political ties . Ernesto Guerra said ZunZuneo disappeared 'like a vacuum' in 2012 and nobody knew why . And the estimated $1.6 million spent on . ZunZuneo was publicly earmarked for an unspecified project in Pakistan, . public government data show. The documents do not specify exactly where the . funds were spent. 'There will be absolutely no mention of . United States government involvement,' according to a 2010 memo from . Mobile Accord Inc., one of the project's creators. 'This is absolutely . crucial for the long-term success of the service and to ensure the . success of the Mission.' Officials at USAID, which denies carrying out actions in secret, would not say who had approved the program or whether . the White House was aware of it. The Cuban government declined a . request for comment. USAID said in a statement that it is 'proud of its work in Cuba to provide basic humanitarian assistance, promote human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to help information flow more freely to the Cuban people'. The service was not offered in official mobile phone shops in Cuba, such as this, but spread covertly . The US Agency for International Development would not say who signed off the project, which was paid for by funds earmarked for an unspecified venture in Pakistan . It said they 'have lived under an authoritarian regime' for 50 years. The agency added its work was found to be 'consistent with US law.' In a 1,000-page document obtained by AP, . ZunZuneo's organizers lay out a plan to build the social network slowly . to avoid detection by the Cuban government. But critics have blasted the covert venture as 'troubling'. Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the US foreign operation's subcommittee, said: 'There is the risk to young, unsuspecting Cuban cellphone users who had no idea this was a U.S. government-funded activity. 'There is the clandestine nature of the program that was not disclosed to the appropriations subcommittee with oversight responsibility. And there is the fact that it was apparently activated shortly after Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor who was sent to Cuba to help provide citizens access to the Internet, was arrested.'  *** .","ZunZuneo 'funded by US' and designed to 'trigger mass gatherings'

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Four Tennessee teenagers fleeing from police after the murder of one of their fathers have been caught in rural South Carolina. Police had been hunting for the three boys and a girl, aged 15 and 16, after finding Richard Blanchard, 36, dead from a gun shot wound in Tennessee. Mr Blanchard's 16-year-old son, Zack, is suspected of shooting him at the family's Greenville home at about 11pm on Wednesday. Caught: One of the four teenagers is led away in handcuffs after nearly one day on the run . Arrest: Members of the sheriff's department lead two of the teenagers away in handcuffs . Afterwards, Zack allegedly tried to . flee from police with his friends Liam Lawler, 15, Shelby Riley, 16, and . Daniel Richards-Burchfield, 15. Police believe the friends met Zack after the murder, and it is not thought that they knew of the killing in advance. Warnings . that the teenagers could be armed and dangerous were issued after . detectives reported that nine weapons, including two AK47s, two shotguns . and five handguns had been taken from Mr Blanchard's home. Schools in the neighborhood where the teenagers were last spotted were ordered to be on alert, and parents were urged to be home to greet their children at the end of the school day. 'I would be concerned if I lived in the neighborhood,' Sheriff Lee Foster told WISTV when the search was still being carried out. 'We have a concern that this is a relatively quiet area. People still don't lock their doors, people leave their keys in their cars.' Wanted: Zack Blanchard, left, who is suspected of murder, fled with friends including Liam Lawler, right . Found: The friends, including Daniel Richards-Burchfield, left, and Shelby Riley, right, were caught on Thursday . When the minivan the teenagers are believed to have been driving was spotted in South Carolina, police used stop strips to trap it. Helicopters, . SWAT teams, about 80 officers and bloodhounds were used to track the . teenagers, after they fled into woodland on foot. The dogs later lost . the scent in a swampy region. Police . recovered the rifles and shotguns inside the wrecked vehicle, but the . handguns were not found, leading to continued concerns that the group . may still be armed. The teenagers were finally caught after a strawberry farmer called 911 after recognizing the group of friends from wanted posters that had been circulated. Manhunt: A huge search effort, involving the sheriff's department and SWAT teams, was launched . Getaway vehicle: A minivan allegedly used by the teenagers is hauled away after it crashed . Evidence: Police search the vehicle believed to have been used by the friends . They were arrested without incident, and one allegedly told officers that the remaining weapons had been dumped in a creek. Newberry County Sheriff Lee Foster told Fox Carolina it was unclear whether Lawler, Riley and Richards-Burchfield knew Blanchard was wanted for murder. The teenagers were allegedly heading to Myrtle Beach, more than 360 miles from the murder scene, when they were caught. Police said the teenagers used social media to communicate with each other after the shooting. Stake out: An armed officer searches a property near where the group were spotted . Tactics: Law enforcement agencies coordinate their search efforts . Warnings: Police stopped traffic and released pictures of the suspects, who were believed to be armed . Foster told WISTV: 'They have no family in the area [where they were found]. They ended up here by flight and happenstance.' Tennessee Bureau of Investigations will be dealing with charges relating to the murder of Mr Blanchard. In South Carolina, the teenagers will face only one charge of allegedly failing to stop for law enforcement.

"By . Martin Robinson . These beautiful flamingos are ready for the start of spring after they all passed their annual health check. The flock of 100 Chilean birds were put through their paces by staff at Chester Zoo, Cheshire. The brightly coloured birds were assessed by the zoo's expert keepers and vets on their weight, the condition of their feet, legs and skull size. Health check: These flamingos have passed their annual MOT by experts at Chester Zoo . Tracking: The beautiful birds are also being chipped to ensure they can be found and monitored . Wild flamingo chase: This fleeing fowl also had its skull measured so its sex can be determined . They are also ringed and fitted with microchips by the zoo's expert bird keepers and vets so that they can be identified and monitored in future. By measuring their skulls, staff can find out the sex of the bird. Andrew Owen, Curator of birds, said: 'We are keen to assess the condition of every flamingo and make sure that they are happy and healthy prior to the breeding season, which will begin in late spring. 'It's a very important part of our programme of care for the birds. And it is also really useful for us to know who's who - the females have usually got much smaller skulls. 'On top of this the checks will help us to be able to identify each and every one of the birds and look at how different pairs bond, as it's not yet known whether or not flamingos choose different mates over the course of their lives or for how long they breed for. 'This kind of information can then be passed on to help conservationists in the wild and help protect the long term future of the species.' Hard at work: Zoo staff have checked more than 100 birds in recent days to help protect their futures . Beautiful: The birds are considered an endangered species because poachers target their eggs . Precise: The pink wading birds also had their feet assessed and their legs and skulls were measured . The birds have been kept at the zoo since the 1960s. Chilean flamingos are also found in Argentina and Bolivia and are classed as a near threatened species with just 200,000 to 300,000 left in the wild.  The birds - which are a target for poachers who steal their eggs - are expected to become endangered with a high risk of extinction in the near future.","Beautiful birds had annual check-up at Chester Zoo in time for spring .

"By . Lucy Crossley . The police watchdog is to interview ministers from the Thatcher government to establish if the former Prime Minister had been wrongly told that Liverpool fans were at fault for the Hillsborough disaster. On the day after the ill-fated FA Cup semi final, in which 96 people died, Margaret Thatcher visited the Sheffield ground where she was briefed by Peter Wright, then chief constable of South Yorkshire Police. New inquests into the deaths of the Hillsborough victims commenced this . week, but the ongoing Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) probe is a separate investigation into the . aftermath of the disaster. Findings: The IPCC is to interview ministers from the Thatcher government to establish if the former Prime Minister had been wrongly told that Liverpool fans were at fault for the Hillsborough disaster . Tragedy: The Hillsborough disaster unfolded on April 15, 1989 during Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest . Former editor of The Sun, Kelvin MacKenzie, has told the IPCC that . claims made on the newspaper's front page story, which blamed drunken . Liverpool fans for the tragedy, were backed up by what Mrs Thatcher was . told by chief constable Wright. The story, which ran with the headline . The Truth, also falsely claimed that fans stole from the dead, attacked . members of the emergency services and urinated on police officers. Allegations . made in the coverage had come from copy sent by a Sheffield-based news . agency, which was based on briefings by the local Police Federation and . an MP, and included comments made by police officers of violence . directed towards them by fans. Visit: The day after tragedy Margaret Thatcher visited Hillsborough where she was briefed by Peter Wright, then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police. Douglas Hurd also attended (pictured far right) Claims: Kelvin MacKenzie, has told the Independent Police Complaints Commission that claims made on the newspaper's front page were backed up by what Mrs Thatcher was told by Chief Constable Wright . Then sports minister Colin Moynihan and Home Secretary of the time Douglas Hurd, now Lord Hurd, joined Mrs Thatcher for her visit to Hillsborough on April 16, 1989. She spoke with chief constable Wright, . who died in 2011, but the Hillsborough Independent Panel found that . after examining documents from the time of the disaster they could find . no record of the briefing given to Mrs Thatcher and Lord Hurd. The report, published in 2012, found there was no evidence that fans had conspired to arrive late at the stadium' and 'no evidence that they stole from the dead and dying'. It also found that statements made by police officers and ambulance staff were doctored. Aftermath: Then sports minister Colin Moynihan and Home Secretary of the time Douglas Hurd, now Lord Hurd, joined Mrs Thatcher for her visit to Hillsborough on April 16, 1989 . Evidence: The Hillsborough Independent Panel found that after examining documents from the time of the disaster they could find no record of the briefing given to Mrs Thatcher and Lord Hurd . According to The Independent, Mr MacKenzie and ex-Sun political editor . Trevor Kavanagh have both told the IPCC that Mrs Thatcher's . foreign-policy adviser Charles Powell, now Lord Powell, had confirmed details of the . newspaper's Hillsborough coverage to Mr Kavanagh before it was . published. Mr MacKenzie said IPCC officers told him they would be interviewing Lord Powell and Lord Moynihan, who is now chairman of the British Olympic Association, as part of their investigation into the aftermath of the tragedy. Lord Powell said that 25 years on from the disaster he could not remember speaking to a journalist, and had not been at the stadium - so was unable to confirm any details. Lord Moynihan, Lord Hurd and the IPCC have not commented on the claims. Colleague: Lord Hurd, who visited Hillsborough with Margaret Thatcher at the former Prime Minister's funeral last year . Minster: Colin Moynihan (left) visits Sheffield in 1989 following the Hillsborough disaster, and in his role as the BOA chairman during the London Olympics (right) Distant past: Charles Powell, pictured with Margaret Thatcher in 2000, said he could not remember speaking to Trevor Kavanagh, and had not been at the stadium . Anger: The Sun's front page headlined The Truth falsely claimed that fans stole from the dead, attacked members of the emergency services and urinated on police officers . Result: The IPCC probe was announced after the commission reviewed the report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, which uncovered a huge amount of new evidence about what happened during and after the tragedy . Grief: A Liverpool fan visits the Hillsborough Shrine at Anfield . Mr Kavanagh told the Independent: 'If you got something from a trusted source and you confirmed it separately with a conversation from someone reporting to the Prime Minister, you could scarcely ask for better sources.' The IPCC's investigation - the biggest it has ever undertaken - is separate from Operation Resolve - the criminal investigation into the 1989 tragedy. The IPCC probe was announced after . the commission reviewed the report of the Hillsborough Independent . Panel, which uncovered a huge amount of new evidence about what happened . during and after the tragedy. Apology: In September 2012, following the publication of the Hillsborough Panel Report, Mr MacKenzie apologised for the Sun's story . It . is examining allegations including those surrounding amendments to . police statements, the actions of the police officers after the disaster . and the role of West Midlands Police, which investigated what happened . at the time. Operation . Resolve, under the command of assistant commissioner Jon Stoddart, the . retired chief constable of Durham Police, is a new, wider-ranging . criminal investigation into the disaster. Operation Resolve has supplied a report for coroner Lord Justice Goldring who this week began fresh inquests into the deaths of the 96 victims. The new inquests, expected to take up to a year, were ordered after controversial verdicts of accidental death were recorded following the original inquests 23 years ago. In September 2012, following the publication of the Hillsborough Panel Report, Mr MacKenzie apologised for the Sun's story. He had said: . 'Twenty-three years ago I was handed a piece of copy from a reputable . news agency in Sheffield in which a senior police officer and a senior . local MP were making serious allegations against fans in the stadium. 'I had absolutely no reason to believe that these authority figures would lie and deceive over such a disaster. 'I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong.'","Margaret Thatcher visited the Sheffield ground the day after the tragedy .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Jailed: Drink driver Luke Sykes, 31, admitted causing the death of young beautician Olivia Flanagan and was sentenced to eight years in prison . The parents of a young beautician killed by a drink driver in a head on crash have hit out after he was jailed for just eight years. Teenager Olivia Flanagan was on her way home from her new job when she died in the collision with 31-year-old Luke Sykes, who was over the drink drive limit. Sykes admitted causing death by dangerous driving, and was sentenced to eight years in prison, as well as being banned from getting behind the wheel for ten years. But the parents of 18-year-old Olivia said the sentencing guidelines for dangerous drivers responsible for fatalities were 'wholly inadequate and not fit for purpose.' Olivia had been in her new job at a branch of Boots in the Fosse Park shopping centre in Leicester for just three weeks when her Peugeot 206 was struck by Luke Sykes' VW Passat on the A511 near Coalville in December last year. She was also planning to buy a new house with her boyfriend Mike Davies at the time of the tragedy. 'Olivia was a stunningly beautiful young woman with a wonderful dry and funny sense of humour which people immediately warmed to,' said her family in a statement made after Sykes was sentenced yesterday. 'She was a truly wonderful, daughter, sister, aunty and friend. 'On the 5th December 2013 through no fault of her own, Olivia’s beautiful and promising life was ripped away from her through the reckless, unbelievable and sickening actions of Luke Sykes who had only recently had his driving licence returned to him in September 2013 after being previously being banned from driving. 'He was over the alcohol limit at the time of the accident. 'It is blatantly clear that the sentencing guidelines for death by dangerous driving are wholly inadequate and not fit for purpose, especially for individuals with a history of driving offences and disregard for other road users. The sentence given today certainly does not reflect the gravity of the crime and the utter devastation caused to our family through the loss of Olivia. Victim: Beauty consultant Olivia Flanagan, 18, died when her Peugeot 206 was struck by Luke Sykes' VW Passat in Coalville, Leicestershire . 'Not an hour goes by where we don’t think about Olivia and feel the unbelievable pain and loss which is just indescribable and can only be felt and understood by those who have lost a child or sister in such terrible circumstances.' Olivia's father Martin described the moment he heard of her death. 'It’s the news that every parent dreads hearing,' he said. 'She had been driving for six months and we always told her to drive carefully whenever she went anywhere and she always did.' He added: 'She was such a beautiful daughter, inside and out, who really, really grasped life. 'She had been working as a beautician at Fosse Park and it was a job she had really wanted. She was also studying two nights a week and doing beauty treatments in her own time. Guilty: Sykes, 31, of  Coleorton, Leicestershire, was sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on Thursday after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing . 'She was going to move in with Mike - they had found a nice place. The two of them had been together for two years and they were inseparable.' Olivia, who lived in Measham, Leicestershire, had an older brother Chris, 21, and a sister Katie, 23, who has a three-year-old son Ben. Her mother, Donna, said: 'Olivia was such a popular girl and was loved by so many people. 'The sentence given today certainly does not reflect the gravity of the crime and the utter devastation caused to our family' Olivia Flanagan's family . 'The whole community around here is devastated. There have been so many wonderful tributes.' Sykes, 31, of  Coleorton, Leicestershire, was sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on Thursday after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing. 'Sykes chose to get behind the wheel of the car and he knew he was over the drink drive limit, his actions resulted in the death of an innocent young girl who had her whole life ahead of her,' said Detective Constable Seamus Burns of the East Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit. 'Luckily the fact that he pleaded guilty at a previous hearing has meant the family have not had to relive the events of that evening in the court room. 'The case highlights the dangers that drivers put themselves and other road users in when they believe they are safe to drink and drive. 'Sykes will now face a significant period behind bars and his family will have to live their lives without him by their side.'","Olivia Flanagan, 18, was on her way home from her new job when she died .

"By . David Gardner In Los Angeles . The castaway who claims he was lost at sea for thirteen months will provide 'proof' that he really did survive for so long on a small boat cast adrift on the Pacific Ocean. Jose Salvador Alvarenga is planning to hold a press conference Friday to hit back at skeptics who have doubted that his extraordinary survival story is genuine. 'There is nothing funny about the . ordeal Jose faced', said Jeff Masonek, head of Masonek Law Offices - . which has offices in Santa Ana, California, Argentina and El Salvador - which is representing the survivor. 'Proof': Alvarenga will reveal that he has medical tests done that show his condition is consistent with that of someone who has gone through the ordeal he describes . Skeptics: Many have cast doubt on his extraordinary tale. Alvarenga claims to have drifted more than 5,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean for 13 months on this tiny fishing boat, eating raw turtle and drinking his own urine to stay alive . 'A young man died beside him in that . boat and Jose had to reach down to the very depths of his being to stay . alive against almost insurmountable odds. 'To anybody who knows Jose, any suggestion that he is exaggerating is just absurd and an unfair slur on his reputation.' The engine on Alvarenga’s 26-foot fiberglass boat gave out on his way home from a routine two-day shark-fishing trip on the Mexican coast in December 2012. Incredibly, the hardy 37-year-old fisherman kept alive eating birds and turtles to wash up 6,700 miles away on a remote coral atoll in the Marshall Islands more than a year later. But he has faced a barrage of skepticism since being discovered naked and close to death after finally reaching land on January 30 this year. At Friday's press conference in San Salvador, the capital of his native El Salvador, doctors and a psychologist are expected to explain how the fisherman’s physical and mental health is consistent with a man who endured such a marathon ordeal at sea. His lawyers say they will also reveal . the results of a lie detector test that Alvarenga volunteered to take to . prove once and for all that he is telling the truth. Alvarenga, . who is hoping to strike a book and movie deal for his story, is said to . be 'devastated' at claims that he has been lying to his family and to . the world since he made it to safety. He . said his fishing companion, Ezequiel Cordova, 21, lived four months in . the boat with him before succumbing to starvation and exposure. 'Slurs': The fisherman, seen here on his return to El Salvador, reached 'down to the very depths of his being' to survive, his lawyer said. He added that 'there is nothing funny about his ordeal' and any suggestions of exaggeration are 'absurd' The castaway, now reunited with his family, has denied cruel claims that he resorted to cannibalism to survive and was particularly upset over a TV spoof mocking his story. Alvarenga, who is struggling with health problems as a result of the journey, has told how his faith helped him believe that he would one day be found as his boat was carried by storms and currents across the ocean. He ate raw birds and fish and drank his own urine to survive. Alvarenga has yet to talk in any detail about his unique ordeal. 'We already have a large number of offers from people interested in telling Jose’s story,' said Masonek. 'But at the moment, he is more interested in focusing on regaining his health and in the world understanding that he has been telling the truth.'","Jose Salvador Alvarenga, 37, will hold a press conference in San Salvador Friday to reveal results of tests which he claims proves his extraordinary story is genuine .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A male cyclist died in London this morning after colliding with a lorry at an accident blackspot. The unnamed man was apparently hit by the waste truck at the Ludgate circus junction at the bottom of Fleet Street, where six others have died since 2008. According to the London Ambulance Service the cyclist died at the scene of the accident which happened shortly after 10am. A cyclist has been killed in central London this morning after colliding with a lorry at 10am . The man, who has not been named, was pronounced dead at the scene while the lorry driver was arrested . The 53-year-old lorry driver stopped at the scene and has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. According to the London Evening Standard, both the cyclist and the lorry were thought to have been travelling down Fleet Street before turning left into Farrigdon Road. Paul Gurney, who arrived seconds after the accident, described the scene as 'sickening'. He initially thought the cyclist had survived, but soon realised he had suffered a serious head injury. The 32-year-old from Bushey told the Standard: 'It's heartbreaking. My heart goes out to the family. It seems like he was just cycling to work - there's no coming back from an accident like that. 'The body was completely lifeless. The driver looked really shaken up. He was just sitting at the side of the road with police officers.' London Assembly Green Party member Darren Johnson said there had been six cyclists killed or seriously injured at the junction between 2008 and 2012. He added that Ludgate Circus had featured on Transport for London's original list of 100 junctions which it planned to overhaul following safety concerns, but that it had not featured on a revised list of 33 junctions where work would be carried out. Campaigners say the junction is a known blackspot and that six cyclist have been killed there since 2008. There were plans to improve safety for cyclists at the junction, but these have since been scrapped . Mr Johnson said London mayor Boris Johnson 'has to show some leadership and take responsibility for getting London's road network fit for cycling'. He went on: 'It is terrible to think that we have to endure another decade of preventable casualties at this junction and many others which have been dropped from the mayor's list, because of the lack of money.' Last autumn six cyclists were killed on London's roads in just two weeks leading to calls for more money to be invested in cycle lanes and safety measures. At the time, former Olympic cyclist Chris Boardman asked the London Mayor to look at introducing a similar system ot Paris where heavy good vehicles are banned from the roads during peak hours. Out of 14 cyclists killed last year in London, nine were involved in accidents with HGVs. At least two cyclists have died as a result of accidents in London this year. Bus depot manager Kevin Lane was killed in Woodford Green in February and retired teacher Michael Mason died in hospital last month, two weeks after an accident.

"By . Paul Donnelley . A priceless 300-year-old tapestry depicting the ‘finest hour’ of Winston Churchill’s most illustrious ancestor has undergone a major restoration for the first time. The work of art hangs at Blenheim Palace and tells the story of the 1st Duke of Marlborough’s victories over the French in the War of the Spanish Succession. The Duke, John Churchill, was a brilliant military strategist and much like Winston Churchill two centuries later, led an Allied force to victory in Europe. Blenheim House Manager Kate Ballenger inspects the washed tapestry, significantly hung next to an oil painting of Louis XIV, the man the Duke had just defeated . A priceless 300-year-old tapestry depicting the 'finest hour' of Winston Churchill's most illustrious ancestor has undergone a major restoration for the first time . The giant wall hangings, 25ft wide and 15ft tall, are made of wool and silk and were woven in the Brussels workshop of the Flemish weaver, Judocus de Vos . The outcome of the war is considered a turning point in history, signalling the end of France’s ambitions to rule Europe at the time. To mark his achievement the duke commissioned 10 incredibly detailed tapestries to be made. The giant wall hangings, 25ft wide and 15ft tall, are made of wool and silk and were woven in the Brussels workshop of the Flemish weaver, Judocus de Vos. The most significant work is the Bouchain III tapestry depicting the French surrender to the duke. It has now been subjected to a painstaking £60,000 restoration and has been cleaned and conserved for future generations. The priceless 300-year-old tapestries are examined after being cleaned and re-hung . This essential restoration work is returning them to their former glory and helping to protect them for future generations to enjoy . Kate Ballenger, the house manager at Blenheim Palace, the ancestral home of the Churchills, said: ‘The tapestry was taken to a team of restoration experts based in Brussels – the same city where it was made. ‘After being unpacked, and following a thorough examination, it was submerged in a large bath and gently washed to remove the dirt. ‘There were a number of splits in the sky as well as silk loss in several sections. These were repaired and a new support was added to the back to strengthen the wool and silk. The tapestry is soaked in a special cleaning solution (left); Blenheim House Manager Kate Ballenger inspects the washed tapestry, significantly hung next to an oil painting of Louis XIV, the man the Duke had just defeated . ‘The tapestry had also been previously hung on poppers but these were removed and replaced with Velcro to enable quick and safe removal in case of emergency. ‘These tapestries are an extraordinary record of an historic military victory which had a crucial effect both on Europe and the rest of the world, as well as stunning works of art. ‘This essential restoration work is returning them to their former glory and helping to protect them for future generations to enjoy.’ The series of tapestries are collectively known as The Victories of the Duke of Marlborough and took eight years to make, from between 1709 to 1717. They were commissioned by the duke to celebrate his victory over rival Louis XIV in a series of battles, including the Battle of Blenheim in Bavaria in 1704. At the time the victory was hailed as the greatest British military success since Agincourt, with Sir Winston Churchill later saying it changed the ‘political axis of the world’. A grateful nation built Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire to recognise the duke’s achievements. The tapestries are the most accurate and detailed contemporary records that exist of the campaign, not least because the duke provided accurate battle plans and portraits of the principal characters. They were removed from Blenheim Palace’s second state room before being rolled up and transported to Belgium for renovation. Eventually, all 10 panels will be removed, cleaned and repaired in the same way at a cost of more than £500,000. John Churchill, the 1st duke of Marlborough, was born at Devon in November 1650 and his father was called Sir Winston Churchill who was a Cavalier during the Civil War. The Duke of Marlborough receiving the French surrender . John became an ensign in the regiment that became the Grenadier Guards. He fought bravely in the Battle of Sole Bay in May 1672 but despite being recommended for a promotion by the Duke of York (the future King James II), it was initially denied on the orders of his brother King Charles II, it is thought because Churchill, a ladies’ man, was sleeping with the king’s mistress. Churchill became a captain a month later. A gallant soldier, Churchill took part in many campaigns fighting at Maastricht and Strasbourg before being appointed an aide to the Duke of York. Through marriage and various machinations, Churchill became a wealthy man. In 1679, he was elected MP for Newtown, Isle of Wight. The following year he became the Duke of York’s principal adviser. In 1682 in recognition of this Charles ennobled him as Lord Churchill of Eyemouth. Churchill and his wife lived in St James’s Palace and then the Palace of Whitehall. He became MP for St Albans. When James II became king Churchill was appointed ambassador-extraordinary to France and then Baron Churchill of Sandridge. In 1688, Churchill switched allegiance to William of Orange as James fled England in the Glorious Revolution. William told Churchill to re-form the Army in advance of the impending war with France. Two days before William and Mary’s coronation they created him Earl of Marlborough. He later became commander-in-chief of the Army in England. However, in 1792 after it was discovered that he was in contact with James II, Churchill was sacked by the king. Things worsened and he was sent to the Tower of London, on suspicion of high treason. He was released after six weeks. On William’s death, Queen Anne came to the throne and Churchill became one of the most important men in English military and diplomatic affairs in the period 1702-1710. Churchill commanded the Allied forces in the War of the Spanish Succession. As a reward Queen Anne created him Marquess of Blandford and Duke of Marlborough and an income of £5,000 a year for her lifetime (later extended to his lifetime). It was at the Battle of Blenheim that Marlborough showed his tactical genius defeating the Franco-Bavarian army – the first time in 40 years the French suffered a major defeat. As a reward in 1705 Anne gave him the former royal manor of Woodstock, which produced revenues of £6,000 a year. A house was built at Woodstock was the duke’s family seat and a national memorial for the battle. Parliament examined the costs and with a major war being fought tried to cut back on the project but despite the austerity measures Marlborough would have none of it and insisted that building went ahead. He also insisted that his titles be passed on to his daughters, his sons having predeceased him. The Duke of Marlborough died in June 1722. A full state funeral took place on August 9, 1722. He left an estate worth about £1,000,000. In 1933 to 1938 his descendant Winston Churchill wrote a four-volume biography of him.","John Churchill commissioned 10 tapestries to mark his victories .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . An exiled former member of a notorious religious cult has won custody of his many children from two ex-wives still part of the polygamous sect. Lorin Holm’s nearly three-year-long court battle came to an end with Thursday’s ruling in St George, Utah, after only two days of hearings that awarded him his more than a dozen children. Holm was exiled in 2011 from the Warren Jeffs-led Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) after being accused of being unfaithful to his three wives. His first wife left the cult with him and they sued for custody. Victorous: Lorin Holm listens as as his ex-wife, Lynda Peine testifies Tuesday in 5th District Court in St. George, Utah - she admitted she would disregard the laws of the land and follow the laws of God laid out by FLDS leader Warren jeffs . The pair argued the youngsters were at risk for sexual abuse after Jeffs was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting underage girls he called ‘brides.’ Lynda Peine, one of the two exes, claimed in court she still follows the pedophile and the ‘laws of God,’ according to the Deseret News. The woman was accused by a woman testifying in court of helping Jeffs to assault her when she was only 14-years-old. ‘You’ve also testified that you understand marrying 12-year-olds or 13-year-olds is against the law,’ Holm’s attorney asked her in court, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. ‘If there is a conflict between the laws of God given by Warren Jeffs and the laws of the land, which is supreme in your mind? Which would you follow?’ The lawyer asked. Locked up for life: polygamist leader Warren Jeffs shown in a 2011 Texas Department of Criminal Justice photo . ‘The laws of God,’ she replied, according to the paper. Holm and his attorney offered the testimony up as proof his children are at risk of sexual abuse or even being forced into child labor if allowed to stay with the fundamentalists. Peine denied knowing why FLDS members called Holm an ‘apostate’ during cross-examination by his attorney, according to the Tribune, but did admit not wanting the children around him because he is a bad influence since being banished. Peine insisted she has told the children only to respect and obey their father. The judge awarded him custody because he said it was more likely the father would allow his ex-wives to visit the children than they were to allow him to visit them, according to the Tribune. There have been rumors that Jeffs runs the FLDS cult from prison, the Deseret News reported. An estimated 7,500 people still belong to the group and follow him as a prophet, according to the Deseret News.","Lorin Holm has been in and out of courts trying to win custody of his numerous children with two wives since 2011 .

Police arrested Marsh and Rapp at the scene after finding marijuana and a pipe nearby. The boy suffered minor injuries including road rash after being trailed along by his backpack harness, and is now in the care of his mother. Attempts to contact Marsh by local station KUTV led them to a run-down home where a party was going on. Marsh's brother Johny Phillips defended him, saying that he was good father but admitted that his brother does chain up his son. Mr Philips, who was dressed in lingerie, said: 'I know why he chained him to the tree. It's something he does when we go fishing and stuff because the kid has a tendency of going all over the place. Last time, I had to save him from going into the river.' He added: 'He's a damn good dad, he cares about his kid.' Marsh remains in the Salt Lake County Jail while Rapp was released on bond.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Deported: Mauritian student Yashika Bageerathi said she is 'alone and scared' as she arrived back in her home country . Deported Mauritian student Yashika Bageerathi said she is 'alone and scared', and does not know what to do as she arrived back in her home country with nowhere to stay. The 19-year-old said she was being looked at as if she 'was a criminal' when she landed in Mauritius after being deported from the UK on Wednesday night. A number of last-minute attempts were made to prevent her being sent to Mauritius, including an emergency court order and an appeal from . chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee Keith Vaz. Following her arrival on an Air . Mauritius flight, the teenager was immediately interviewed by police, . and is now looking for somewhere safe to stay, according to her . headteacher. Miss Bageerathi came to the UK with her . mother, sister and brother in 2011 to escape a relative who she said was . physically abusive, and claimed asylum last summer. 'I am just all alone here, everyone is in England,' she told ITV News via Skype from Mauritius . 'I don't know what to do.' She confirmed that four security guards flew with her and said: 'I just wanted to do everything lawfully and I was just doing everything being asked.' She said she was scared, adding: 'Even today I was told media people (were) waiting for me at the airport and even walking in the airport people were looking at me like I was a criminal.' Friends, family, politicians and her . school have all campaigned to push back her deportation until she had . finished studying for her A levels, but to no avail. Protest: Friends, family, politicians and her school have all campaigned to push back her deportation until she had finished studying for her A levels, but to no avail . Anger: Demonstrators gathered in Parliament Square, London, on Saturday to protest against the deportation of student Yashika Bageerathi . Asked what her message was to politicians, she said: 'I really want to complete my education and it's just so hard being here. 'I want to be there with my friends, in school with my teachers.' When she was posed the question of what she would do next, she said: 'I don't know, still trying to make arrangements.' Miss Bageerathi was due to take her A-level exams next month, with the first on May 14 and the final one will be held on June 23. She said she did not think she could complete her education in Mauritius. Background: Miss Bageerathi came to the UK with her mother, sister and brother in 2011 to escape a relative who she said was physically abusive, and claimed asylum last summer . 'I don't think I can, with all the people watching me and all the media wanting to talk to me about what (is) happening - I don't know, it's just so annoying and unfair,' she said. 'It's really unfair to come to know I was coming back on the same day and not inform me before.' Lynne Dawes, headteacher at Oasis Academy Hadley in Enfield, north London, said the school was in regular contact with the promising student and the immediate concern was to find her a safe place to stay. She said they were working to ensure she would still be able to complete her A-levels. Ms Dawes said the student felt 'low' and added: 'She's feeling the lowest I have heard her be for quite a while. 'She was also very subdued.' Thwarted: Even last-minute attempts by Keith Vaz MP to stop the deportation failed after he wrote to the Home Secretary to ask her to 'urgently reconsider' the decision . A spokesman for the Oasis charity, . which runs the academy, said they were supporting the family, as well as . the student, who he described as 'very frightened'. He added: 'Yashika's mum is very upset understandably, she's very emotional and she's very worried. 'Worry is the overriding feeling.' Previous attempts to deport Miss Bageerathi were thwarted when Air Mauritius refused to fly her out following an earlier refusal by British Airways - but Air Mauritius later confirmed it had received a 'directive' from the UK authorities that the youngster must leave. The deportation followed a judge at London's Law Courts refusing to grant an emergency injunction to block the deportation to give her time to take her case to the Court of Appeal. The last-ditch application was made yesterday as the youngster was being driven from Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre in Bedfordshire to Heathrow airport. Even last-minute attempts by Keith Vaz MP to stop the deportation failed after he wrote to the Home Secretary to ask her to 'urgently reconsider' the decision. In his letter to Theresa May yesterday, Mr Vaz said: 'It is hardship enough for this young woman to be separated from her family and returned to Mauritius, where she claims she fears persecution. 'To interrupt her education at this late stage in order to do so seems needlessly cruel.' Miss Bageerathi, whose case sparked a petition that has attracted around 178,000 signatures, had been detained at Yarl's Wood since March 19. Paul Nettleship, one of the solicitors for Miss Bageerathi and her mother, said the options were limited for the student but they were looking into pursuing an out of country appeal. He said: 'We're looking into it but the problem is that even if we can do that, it will be after her exams.'","Yashika Bageerathi is back in Mauritius after she was deported .

Muntean told the AP she has heart . problems and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She said she was still celebrating meeting her daughter when Owens was killed. Her 54-year-old . daughter sought her out, she said, and the two met on March 23. Goodwin said Muntean was told by Owens' wife that he was shot in the chest. Owens' cousin, Glen Welton of Effingham, said Owens grew up with military dreams. 'He was one of those kids who wanted to wear camouflage and wanted to wear bomber jackets and sunglasses,' said Welton, himself a National Guard veteran of Iraq. 'It took him a few years before he got himself in.' Recovering: One of the wounded was identified as Maj. Patrick Miller, pictured, a 32-year-old Iraq War veteran from western New York, the state's Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday . Fighter: The family of Patrick Miller, pictured with his wife Ashley, would push through . Owens dropped out of high school in 1995, . according to his mother and school records. She said he earned his GED . diploma after joining the Army in 2004. Welton said he ran into Owens last year at a funeral and the two figured out they had served in Iraq at the same time. Welton was there from 2005-06. A photo from that day shows Welton with his arm around Owens, who wore his Army dress uniform, including a beret, and a pair of dark sunglasses. 'He had grown into a man. The military had made him a complete man,' Goodwin said. 'I sure know he cleaned up pretty with his uniform.' Owens was one of Muntean's four children. A younger son died eight years ago after a lifelong disability, Goodwin said. Family said Owens had been previously married and had children from that marriage. Another victim: McComb woman, Renee Powell Westbrook, on Thursday identified her husband, Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook, pictured left and right, as among those shot in Wednesday’s rampage . A trauma center outside the base said the conditions had improved for three people who sustained critical injuries in the attack. Dr. Matthew Davis, trauma director at Scott & White Memorial Hospital, expressed optimism nobody else would die from their injuries. Several patients were released from the hospital Thursday. One of the wounded was identified as Maj. Patrick Miller, a 32-year-old Iraq War veteran from western New York, the state's Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday. Miller, who lives with his wife outside Austin, Texas, is a native of Allegany in Cattaraugus County. 'I know he's going to make it because he's way tougher than that,' Tim Miller, Patrick Miller's brother, told NBC News. The soldier's family said Miller was shot in the stomach and underwent surgery Wednesday night. His mother, Carol, said she was in shock when she heard the news. 'I wanted to sit down all of a sudden. It was like, ""Oh my God!""' Carol Miller said. Shooter: Ivan Lopez, seen in this undated photo, has been identified as the soldier who opened fire on Fort Hood army base on Wednesday killing three and injuring 16 others before turning the gun on himself . Perpetrator: Ivan Lopez, pictured, was born and raised in Puerto Rico and got his start in the military via the Puerto Rico National Guard . In a statement, Cuomo said the shooting has left Miller's home state 'saddened and shocked.' 'On behalf of all New Yorkers, I send my . thoughts and prayers for a speedy recovery to the injured victims and . their families,' he said. He said Miller joined the U.S. Army after graduating from St. Bonaventure in 2003. Major Miller was deployed to Iraq for the first time in March 2004 for a year, which he described on his Facebook page as 'the most difficult and challenging year of my life.' He was then a second lieutenant and the commander of a platoon of medics that included Specialist Jude Uchendu. 'He worked hard,' said Specialist Uchendu, who left the military in 2009, told the New York Times. 'He was always out there for his soldiers, and a good leader, too.' Major Miller, who lived in Austin, Texas, with his wife Ashley, had been stationed at Fort Hood since 2004. Later on Thursday, McComb, Mississippi woman, Renee Powell Westbrook, also identified her husband, Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook, as among those wounded in Wednesday's shooting rampage. His wife said he was among the soldier recovering from wounds to the chest and neck. She was traveling to be by his bedside Friday. 'He's assured me he’s O.K. but until I get a visual and say ""O.K., you're O.K.,"" he's not O.K.,' she said. 'They train them to downplay things.'

"By . Matt Rocheleau . Family and friends of the teenage boy who was shot to death by his girlfriend's father after sneaking into her bedroom are demanding that the girlfriend be charged with accessory to murder or involuntary manslaughter. A group of the 17-year-old Johran McCormick's supporters, including his mother Zakia McCormick and community activist Quanell X, rallied on Wednesday morning outside the home near Houston, Texas where authorities say the teenager was killed on March 13. Investigators have said McCormick's 16-year-old girlfriend let him into the house on Bridgestone Ridge Dr. in Spring, Texas. Scroll down for video . Family and friends of 17-year-old Johran McCormick say they want his girlfriend and her father to face charges for their role in his death . The girl's 55-year-old father, who has not been identified, told police that one of his four children woke him at about 2.30am to tell him someone was inside their house. The girl initially told her father that she did not know the boy, prompting the father to call 911 and leading to an argument between McCormick and the father. As the teen motioned as if he was reaching for something, the father shot him in the head, killing him. The girl later admitted that she knew the boy and had let him inside the home. The teen was not armed, according to authorities. The father, who was brought from the house on a stretcher, was hospitalized with panic attack symptoms, according to reports. An unidentified father (pictured above on a stretcher) shot dead a 17-year-old Johran McCormick after finding the teen in bed with his 16-year-old daughter in Spring, Texas on March 13 . A grand jury will determine whether the father should be charged. McCormick's supporters are calling for the girlfriend to be charged with either one or two counts of accessory to murder or involuntary manslaughter for lying to her father about knowing Cormick and letting him into the home, according to KHOU. The teen's father, Shawn Curley, faulted both the father and the girl for his son's death. 'I wish the father could have asked more questions, he could have picked up the phone,' Curley told the Houston Chronicle last month. 'And for her to say she didn't know who he was, that was most hurtful.' A legal expert told the newspaper that the grand jury decision on whether to charge the father will be based on what the dad believed at the time of the shooting. 'If it's perceived that there is a ""stranger"" in his home, there could be a viable claim of self-defense or defense of others,' said Harris County Criminal Lawyers Association president Todd Dupont. Zakia McCormick and community activist Quanell X were among those who rallied outside the home where the boy died, calling for charges to be filed .

"By . Meghan Keneally . and Daily Mail Reporter . A New York City police officer has been arrested in India in an alleged act of retribution for the scandal late last year involving an Indian diplomat and her nanny in Manhattan. Manny Encarnacion was arrested at the international airport in New Delhi after authorities charged him with violating the Arms Act of 1959 because he had three bullets in his jacket pocket. The specifics of how he allegedly broke the law remain unclear but a comment made by one of the arresting officers suggests that it had more to do with the treatment of the Indian diplomat, Deyani Khobragade, than anything else. Trumped up: Manny Encarnacion has been charged with violating an Indian Arms deal because airport officials found three bullets in the NYPD officer's jacket pocket . 'You guys like to strip-search our diplomats,' said one of the Indian police officers allegedly, according to The New York Post. The . dig is a clear reference to the uproar that was caused when Ms . Khobragade was searched by the NYPD after she was arrested for keeping . her nanny in virtual servitude with very little pay in December. Fighting back: The strip search ordered of Devyani Khobragade (pictured) outraged many in India and now some have taken it out on Americans . Ms . Khobragade was the deputy counsul general for the Indian consulate . general of India in New York at the time and it led to an international . standoff between the two countries. She left the United States on January . 9th after taking the State Department's offer of immunity that comes . with a diplomatic visa, but the case didn't end there. A district court judge in Washington . ruled on March 12 that all charges be dropped because of the diplomatic . status but just two days later, she was re-indicted on the same charges. That was around the same time that Mr Encarnacion was taken into custody by Indian police. The 49-year-old officer was traveling to India to visit his wife Vida who is a student living in Iran. When . he was going through a security screening at the airport, they found . three bullets in his jacket pocket that he had accidentally left there . from when he was at a shooting range doing his required NYPD . recertification days before his trip. 'He knows he didn’t do anything wrong... It's an innocent mistake,' Mr Encarnacion's friend Raul Borbon told The New York Post. New York Police Department Deputy Chief Kim Royster said the department was working with the State Department to try to get the charges dropped so Encarnacion could return to the United States. Congressman Peter King wrote a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday to look into the situation. Scandal: The arrest is believed to be retribution for the charges brough against Devyani Khobragade, pictured as she arrived in India on January 11, a diplomat who was barely paying her live-in nanny . Scene: The arrest took place at the Indira Gandhi International Airport (pictured) on March 10 . The New York Republican called the . arrest 'an excessive act by the Indian government' and suggested it was . payback for last year's arrest and strip-search of an Indian consular . official for alleged visa fraud in New York. State . Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said she was aware of the reports of . the officer's arrest but declined to comment on the specifics of the . case because of privacy concerns. Asked . whether the United States is worried whether Americans are potential . targets for retribution because of how the Indian diplomat was treated . in New York, she responded, 'I think we feel like we've moved past this . and hope the Indians have as well. ... India is a very close partner.' Mr Encarnacion has worked for the NYPD for more than 10 years after leaving the Marines and is up for a promotion to the level of detective. The trip, which was initially supposed to last for only two and a half weeks, is now threatening his job because he will be stuck in India for five weeks- assuming everything goes in his favor at his April 19 court appearance. 'He’s out on ($1,000) bail...He’s not sweating it that much because at least he gets to spend time with his wife,' Mr Borbon said.","Police officer Manny Encarnacion is awaiting a court date in India after being charged with breaking the terms of the country's Arms Act of 1959 .

"Missing 16-year-old Cailey-Anne Payne, who has not been in contact with anyone for a week after vanishing from her home in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire . Fears are growing for a 16-year-old girl who has been missing for more than a week. Cailey-Anne Payne has not made contact with family or friends since Saturday morning, prompting police to ramp up the public appeal to find her. Police said the teenager, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, has not used a bank card or updated her social media accounts since she went missing on March 26. Cailey-Anne's best friend has told police she was with her on Saturday morning, when she caught a train to London. Police have since released CCTV pictures of Cailey-Anne at Milton Keynes train station. Thames Valley Police have stressed that the inquiry is still a live missing persons investigation. Detective Superintendent Barry Halliday told a specially-convened Press briefing: 'There is always a concern while we have not been able to make contact with Cailey-Anne, that because of her vulnerability, she has come to harm.' He revealed the 'typical teenager' may have been in Acton, West London, at the weekend and that her picture was being plastered on electronic billboards across the capital. She is known to have friends in the Acton, Hackney and Ealing areas. 'This is a 16-year-old girl who is alone. She has not got any access to money and the reality of it is she has now been missing for seven days,' said the senior detective. 'We are treating this as a live missing persons investigation. We are trying to do all we can to capture any sightings or community intelligence that lets us know Cailey-Anne is safe,' added Det. Supt. Halliday, the Milton Keynes Police commander. 'This appeal also goes out to Cailey-Anne. We want her to know she is not in trouble and our primary aim is for her to make contact with family, friends or indeed the police to let us know she is safe and well.' Cailey-Anne's best friend has told police she was with her on Saturday morning at Milton Keynes station, when she caught a train to London . Cailey-Anne had gone out with friends in Milton Keynes on March 26 but failed to return home to her parents by 11pm as she had been told. Police have now learned from her closest friend that, three days later, she caught a train with her into London around 9am on Saturday morning. CCTV images of Cailey-Anne at Milton Keynes station on Saturday morning released show the 5ft 3ins girl did not have a bag of belongings with her . The friend, who is being debriefed by officers, said they parted ways shortly after arriving in the capital. CCTV images of Cailey-Anne at Milton Keynes station on Saturday morning released show the 5ft 3ins girl did not have a bag of belongings with her. The teen, who has long, dark red dyed hair, was wearing light blue leggings, a green Parka body warmer worn over a black leather jacket, and grey Nike Airforce trainers. Det. Supt Halliday confirmed she had gone missing once before - but added that this was not relevant to his current investigation. He said: 'There is nothing we are aware of at this stage that gives us a very clear catalyst for disappearing and leaving Milton Keynes in the first place. 'Her parents and family are very concerned and they just want Cailey-Anne back. We are working very closely with specialist trained officers here in Milton Keynes, to make sure the family is fully engaged and supported in this process. 'As any parent would, all they want is their child back or at least confirmation they are safe and well. 'We do not have this at the moment, so I urge Cailey-Anne to please get in touch with someone to let everyone know she is safe and well.'","Cailey-Anne Payne hasn't made contact with anyone since Saturday .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Grave charges: Laurel Schlemmer, 40, has been charged with homicide after telling police that 'crazy voices' told her to drown her two younger sons in the bathtub . A Pennsylvania woman claims she heard 'crazy voices' telling her to push her sons underwater before she sat on the boys in the bathtub, drowning her 3-year-old son and leaving his 6-year-old brother in critical condition. Laurel Schlemmer, 40, of McCandless, is being held without bond after she was arraigned early Wednesday on charges including criminal homicide, aggravated assault and child endangerment. Schlemmer told Allegheny County detectives she tried to drown her two youngest sons, 6-year-old Daniel and 3-year-old Luke, after her 7-year-old son left for school Tuesday morning. She put the older boy on his school bus at about 8.40am, then told the younger boys to take off their pajamas and get into the bathtub. 'Schlemmer said after the boys got into the tub she got into the tub ""fully clothed"" and ""crazy voices"" were telling her to push the boys down into the water,' the complaint said. 'Schlemmer explained that at one point she [was] sitting on top of boys while they were under the water in the tub.' The detectives said Schlemmer went on to say that she 'thought she could be a better mother' to the oldest boy 'if the other two boys weren't around and they would be better off in heaven.' Scroll down for video . Family tragedy: Mrs Schlemmer confessed that she told her two younger sons, 3-year-old Luke (far left) and 6-year-old Daniel (far right) to get in the tub and then sat on them, believing she could be a better mother to her older son (center) with them gone . Tight-knit community: The deadly drowning took place in the Schlemmers' home in the 900 block of Saratoga Drive in upscale bedroom community of McCandless, Pennsylvania . Schlemmer pulled both unconscious boys out of the tub and laid them on the bathroom floor while she called 911. She told police she never attempted CPR because she did not know how to do it. Red flags: Mrs Schlemmer was suspected of trying to back over her children with her car last year, and in 2009, she was cited for leaving one of her kids in a hot car unattended . Paramedics who responded to the colonial home in the 900 block of Saratoga Drive rushed Luke and Daniel Schlemmer to UPMC Passavant Hospital, where the younger boy was pronounced dead at around 10.50am. His brother . was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit at Children's . Hospital of Pittsburgh at UPMC, where police said he remained in . critical condition. Word that the two little boys were found unresponsive stunned neighbors in the quiet, upscale bedroom community a few miles north of Pittsburgh. They described the family as religious and said Schlemmer was a stay-at-home mom whose husband, 43-year-old Mark Schlemmer, was working at the time. According to Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the couple got married in 2005. Mr Schlemmer works as an actuary, while his wife had been a teacher before becoming a full-time stay-at-home mom. This wasn't the first time Mrs Schlemmer came in contact with police regarding the treatment of her children. Last year, Schlemmer was reportedly questioned after allegedly trying to back over one her children with her car, but she was never charged, according to the station WPXI. She also received a citation for leaving a toddler unattended in a parked car September 5, 2009, in nearby Ross Township. Court records don't indicate which child was in the car, but police said the car's interior was 112 degrees when officers arrived. The child wasn't injured and Schlemmer paid a small fine, according to court papers. Exemplary family: Neighbors described  the Schlemmers as religious and the wife was a stay-at-home mother . On Wednesday, Schlemmer was jailed without bond because in Pennsylvania bail is not granted to people charged with criminal homicide, except in rare circumstances. Police also charged Schlemmer with attempted homicide, reckless endangerment and tampering with physical evidence, for allegedly hiding her wet clothes in a trash bag and then hiding that bag under three other bags.","Laurel Schlemmer, 40, said she wanted to drown her youngest children, ages three and six, so she could be a better mother to her 7-year-old son .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Reuters . The Fort Hood gunman opened fire after he tried to pick up a form to request time off but was told to come back to the office later, according the father of one of his victims. Ivan Lopez, who was . battling mental illness, shot dead three people and wounded . 16 others with a recently purchased pistol before turning the gun on . himself at Fort Hood on Wednesday. The father of Army Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook, who works in the personnel office at the base and who was hit by four bullets, said that the violent rampage was sparked by a verbal altercation in the office.

Scroll down for video . Gunman: Army Spc. Ivan Lopez killed three people and wounded 16 others in a shooting at Fort Hood on Wednesday before killing himself. It followed a verbal altercation at a personnel office . 'The first guy he shot right in front of my son was killed, and then he turned the gun towards Jonathan, aimed it and fired,' he said. 'I don’t know how many times he fired, but he hit my son four times.' The military has released few details about what motivated the shooting rampage, but at a press conference on Friday, the Fort Hood commander said they believe an argument was a 'direct precipitating factor' before the shooting. Lopez's family suggested in a statement that his mental state could have been affected by his transfer from another base, as well as the recent deaths of his mother and grandfather. 'My son must not have been in his right mind,' said Ivan Lopez Sr. in a statement published on NBC News. 'My son wasn't like that.' The three people killed in a shooting rampage were all male soldiers in their 30s. A memorial is being held for the murdered and injured soldiers next Wednesday. 'Motive': Theodis Westbrook said his son, who was shot, said Lopez had tried to pick up a leave form but was told to return another time. He left, grabbed and gun and then opened fire in the office .

Sgt. First Class Danny Ferguson, 39, from Florida, had just returned from . Afghanistan and died while trying to barricade a door to keep the . shooter away, his fiancée and fellow soldier Kristen Haley told Tampa . broadcaster WTSP-TV. She was nearby when the shooting started. 'He held that door shut because it wouldn't lock. It seems the doors would be bullet proof, but apparently they're not,' Haley told News 10. 'If he wasn't the one standing there holding those doors closed, that shooter would have been able to get through and shoot everyone else.' The third fatality was Carlos Lazaney, 38, of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, the city's mayor told NBC News on Friday. The suspected shooter Lopez enlisted in 2008 and had served two tours of duty abroad, including four months in Iraq in 2011, military officials said. He had no direct involvement in combat and had not been wounded. Gunned down: U.S. Army Sgt.

The Lopez family, who live in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, said in a statement that it is 'dismayed' by the tragic events. 'This is a very painful situation,' the father of Ivan Lopez said in the statement. 'I ask for prayers for the affected families.' 'My son could not have been in sound mind. He was not that way,' he said. The rampage is the third shooting at a military base in the United States in about six months that, along with a series of shootings in public places, such as schools and malls, has intensified a national debate over gun violence. Remembered: Crosses representing the victims of the shooting at Fort Hood military base are displayed outside Central Christian Church in Killeen, Texas on Thursday . It has also raised questions about . security at U.S. military installations, such as Fort Hood, home to some . 45,000 soldiers and airmen assigned to the 335-square-mile . (870-square-km) base, along with thousands of civilian employees. 'Obviously we have a gap. Anytime we . lose an individual, something's gone wrong,' U.S. Defense Secretary . Chuck Hagel told reporters in Hawaii on Thursday. Military officials have so far ruled out terrorism as the reason for the attack. Lopez had been treated for depression and anxiety. He was being evaluated to see if he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, military officials said. The shooting sent shockwaves through the Central Texas community in Killeen, where the base is located, that is still reeling from a 2009 attack in which a former Army psychiatrist, Major Nidal Hasan, shot dead 13 people and wounded 32 others.

"By . Jenny Hope . Hospital records have been sold to dozens of companies including pharmaceutical giants and private firms without patients' knowledge or consent, newly-released data shows. Details about NHS patients have gone to major names including Bayer, Baxter, AstraZeneca, Bupa and Roche. Consultancy firms McKinsey, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Ernst and Young are also among those who have paid to secure data from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). NHS bosses have sold hospital records to dozens of companies including pharmaceutical giants and private firms without patients' knowledge or consent . Some have used the apparently anonymous data to formulate marketing strategies, inform their sales teams and work with clients to get new drugs into the NHS. Campaigners said patients would be shocked to learn how their records have been sold without their consent to boost the profits of private firms - rather than simply being used to improve NHS care. The HSCIC said it only charges for the cost of producing the material and does not make a profit. The release of the information by HSCIC, the new body in charge of NHS patient data, covers contracts agreed with companies from April to December last year. It comes after revelations earlier this year that records going back 13 years were sold to the insurance industry, providing guidance to companies about how to set their prices for cover. Controversial plans to harvest GP records for similar information have been put on hold amid concerns about patient confidentiality, including security from hackers. Details about NHS patients have gone to major names including Bayer, Baxter, AstraZeneca, Bupa and Roche . The consultancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers is one of the companies hospital records have been sold to . But the furore over the Care.data project focused attention on the routine use being made of NHS hospital records by the commercial sector. Roger Goss, of campaign group Patient Concern, said: 'The core purpose of NHS information, usually unstated, is that the information will be used in order for staff to take care of you. That's how 99.99 per cent of patients see it, rather than a way of making money for private companies. 'This came as a deep shock to many patients because some fear that information about their mental or sexual health or anything else they want to keep secret might fall into the wrong hands.' The HSCIC, which pledged to release recent information about hospital data in a bid to improve transparency, says further information going back to 2005 under the supervision of its predecessor will be issued next month. It says universities and charities were among those using statistics it supplied, including Edinburgh University which looked at whether there were changes in the numbers of children admitted to hospital with respiratory infections after the introduction of the smoking ban on July 1 2007. The HSCIC insisted patients could not be identified from such data because it was 'pseudonymised' - stripped of significant letters or numbers that might give clues about individuals. However, Bupa accessed anonymised data that was classed as 'sensitive' to assist them in 'benchmarking performance against national trends'. Roche bought data to look at referrals between GPs and hospitals so it could analyse patient numbers and episodes of care at both an NHS trust and hospital level. The private firm Health IQ Ltd, which works with the NHS and pharmaceutical companies, also accessed data. On its website it said it had helped a client during the pre-launch of a drug in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to raise the 'priority of IBS on the commissioning agenda'. McKinsey used pseudonymised but 'sensitive' data 'as part of our consulting services for clients'. In total, 104 health and social care organisations (such as NHS trusts) and bodies such as universities and charities were included, alongside 56 private firms. Phil Booth, of the campaign group medConfidential, said HSCIC was 'deliberately concealing' releases of data that might cause itself, or ministers or other officials, embarrassment or political damage. It knew of such data because it had attempted to get hold of it. He said it was a 'ridiculous assertion' that pseudonymised data was not sensitive or identifiable. Commercial customers had made clear it was possible to track individuals visit by visit through hospital - and with information in press reports, social media posts or the date your child was born - so their entire record could be read, he said. 'Billions of patient records continue to be sold for commercial use without patients' knowledge or consent, using as justification the very law that minsters have said provides additional safeguards.

"By . Ryan Gorman . A stunning visualization from a University of Chicago master's student shows how the middle class have been pushed almost completely out of the Windy City in only a few decades. Daniel Kay Hertz has created a series of maps dating back to 1970 show the rapidly expanding upper class on the traditionally well-off North Side and the explosion of poverty on historically poorer South Side. The public policy major said the maps posted to his personal website are meant to show that the entrenchment of wealth in the Loop and on the North Side, and of poverty elsewhere, may only be part of a cycle that has seen neighborhoods change radically in only a few years. SCROLL DOWN FOR ANIMATION . What once was: Chicago's wealth was mainly confined to the North Side and far northern outskirts in the 1970s, and a large middle class lived throughout the city - but poverty begins to take hold as the 1980s wear on . Rising gap: The growth in the 1990s of wealth was matched by a rise in . poverty, but larger amounts of wealth started concentrating in Lakeview . (dark green) while the rest of the city began to struggle . As it is today: Staggering amounts of wealth exist on the North Side and . shocking poverty persists to the south and west of the neighborhoods in . green . The maps are ‘not merely to depress you (you’re welcome!), but to suggest just how dramatically the reality of Chicago’s ‘two cities’ has changed over the last few generations, how non-eternal its present state is, and that a happier alternate reality isn’t just possible, but actually existed relatively recently,’ said Hertz. They are based on census tracts and use historical data compiled from a variety of sources, Hertz disclosed on the blog spot. Green, representing wealth, was always present in the Lakeview neighborhood stretching from the Lake Shore to a few blocks west of Wrigley Field. As the decades wear on, less prosperous residents are seen pushed out of the North Side, slowly at first, but then further and further west until they are barely part of the city. Chicago’s reputation as a violent city comes without qualification, but that violence is nowhere to be seen from Wrigleyville, the neighborhood surrounding the iconic Cubs ballpark, all the way to the downtown area referred to as The Loop. Recent developments including Millenium Park and countless condo buildings in the area have turned The Loop from the ghost town it was after office hours to the vibrant upper-class neighborhood it is now. Tale of two cities: Wealthy Chicagoans have taken over The Loop and North Side while the rest of the city has sunk deeper into poverty . Green, which at its darkest shade represents incomes at 200% or higher than the metro median, stretches further and further west from Lake Michigan into even the West Loop, which has recently undergone explosive growth as warehouses have been converted to loft apartments. Hertz refers to this as ‘the ever-widening ghetto of the affluent’ and says that ‘radically exclusionary housing laws’ have made it possible. The rest of the map shows a virtual explosion of poverty, especially on the South Side. The area’s incomes were either just below, above or at the median for the city as recently as 1970, but poverty begins to take hold in the 1980s and only tightens its grip as the decades wear on. Pale shades of orange representing struggling families give way to blocks of red paint a picture of shocking despair. Affluent ghetto: New development was spurred in The Loop by Millenium Park . Thriving: Chicago's North Side, especially the area around Wrigley Field, has always been a relatively prosperous neighborhood, but recent decades have seen that prosperity explode . What was once a working-class neighborhood has turned into drug-addled, crime ridden slums that rank among the most dangerous in the nation and have been dramatized in the Showtime series ‘Shameless.’ There are exceptions to each, pockets of relative prosperity, but the overall trend is downward as most middle class families are pushed further and further out into the suburbs and impoverished ones are hopelessly marooned in less prosperous areas. Going west from the lake is no better. A short 20 minute drive from the bankers and academics on the North Side and in The Loop, especially along West Madison and West Grand Avenues, transitions from industrial areas to poor, lower class households. Shameless: The hit Showtime series is set on Chicago's South Side and chronicles the life of an impoverished family struggling in the poor neighborhood . The area west of Garfield Park has not fared well, nor have the other neighborhoods immediately along the Eisenhower Expressway, a main East-West artery just to the south. ‘The obvious and immediate reaction to these maps is to see them as a direct consequence of rising income inequality,’ wrote Hertz, but he thinks something else is at play. ‘Income segregation has actually risen faster than inequality,’ he believes, or, in other words, purchasing power from working class incomes has continued to fall as the upper class increasingly continues to prosper. The solution, as Hertz sees it, is through housing laws aimed at bringing down the barriers to migration that have gone up over the years.","Chicago's once sizeable middle class has been pushed almost entirely out of the city since the 1970s .

Neither option would come cheap: an estimated $14 . million for demolition and $32 million to $72 million for renovation. 'It is the Eiffel Tower of Queens,' says Matthew Silva, who's making a documentary about the pavilion in Queens' Flushing Meadows Corona Park, comparing it to a remnant of the 1889 Paris Exposition that was also threatened with demolition before it was saved.

Designed by famed architect Philip Johnson, the New York structures debuted with the rest of the World's Fair on April 22, 1964, and quickly became among its most popular attractions. Visitors rode glass 'Sky Streak' elevators to the observation deck of a 226-foot tower — the highest point in the fair. The two shorter towers, at 150 and 60 feet, held a cafeteria and a VIP lounge. The pavilion's 16, 100-foot-tall concrete columns supported what was then the largest suspended roof in the world, a 50,000 square-foot expanse of translucent, multicolored tiles. On the floor below was a $1 million, 9,000-square-foot terrazzo tile map of the state, with details of cities, towns and highways.

'We thought maybe he got run over by a car or a deer killed him in the field,' he said. 'We’re so happy he survived and was picked up and returned to us because of his chip. 'We were so sad, so distraught for 17 months. We talked about him until the very end and never gave up hope.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A TV producer has written about her decision to eat a marijuana cookie while on vacation in Colorado with her children, suggesting that it's no different from relaxing with a glass of wine at night. Wendy Sachs' piece for CNN has sparked mixed reactions, with some slamming the mother as irresponsible, while others agreed it's just a new way to unwind. Sachs, an author who has appeared as a work-life balance expert in television interviews, was on a skiing vacation in Colorado - where recreational marijuana is legal - with her husband and their two children when the slopes left her aching, she said. 'Legalized weed has given aprÃ¨s ski a new meaning,' she wrote. 'So I start weighing my options.' Vacation time: Wendy Sachs and her husband decided to consume marijuana while their children were asleep on a skiing holiday in Colorado. She asked if it was any different than having a glass of wine . She learned that Vail, where she stayed with her family, is pot-free because the mountain is federal land, so she traveled to nearby Breckenridge to find some marijuana. There, she bought a $25 chocolate chip cranberry 'Lucie in the Sky' cookie and some THC-infused chocolate truffles, she wrote. When the children were asleep, they ate part of the cookie. 'I must have consumed more than was . recommended because the next eight hours turned into a heart-racing, . chest-thumping, head-spinning trip,' she wrote. 'The potency of edibles is apparently . unreliable, and they can pack a punch. Who knew?' But the next morning, after a cup of coffee, she said she was fine to get back on the slopes. 'The issue is really whether a glass of wine or a cocktail is any different from legalized pot to relax at the end of the day?' she apparently wrote in the comments beneath the story on CNN's website. Review: She said she ate too much of the cookie and was left with palpitations - but did not regret it . Sachs concluded that, while it failed to relax her as much as she would have liked, she was glad she tried it, adding that next time she would be more aware of how much to eat. Comparing it to alcohol, she also suggested that allowing people to smoke at the resort 'could be a boon for the industry'. 'I would argue that boozing boarders are just as scary and there's no shortage of alcohol at ski resorts in America,' she said. She added that she and her husband Michael had decided to keep their decision secret from their 'super judgy' children, believing they would not be able to understand the choice. 'How do you even broach the subject of marijuana? Mommy needs her glass of wine is now mommy needs her hit of weed?' she wrote. 'At their age, it's probably best to keep it black and white. Drugs, drinking and sex are all bad -- very bad!' But she added that they were sure to put their adult treats in their bedroom, so their children would not run the risk of eating them accidentally. Resort: While staying at the Solaris Residence in Vail, Colorado, Mrs Sachs tried the cookie with her husband while her children were asleep. She said that she ate too much but that she was glad she tried it . After the article was posted on CNN on Friday, it received mixed reactions. 'This wasn't a little puff of weed to help relax akin to a glass of wine or a beer,' one wrote. 'This woman, knowingly ate more than the recommended dose of an edible, and became completely unavailable to care of her kids for a period of around eight hours.' But another reader countered: 'We all have our ways of coping. Some meditate, some exercise, some have a beer. None of them are better or worse than others.' 'She sounds like she was curious, her husband was curious, and they tried it when the kids were safely in bed. All legally,' another added. Marijuana for recreational use became legal in Colorado in December, when the governor declared the voter-approved change part of the state constitution. Colorado became the second state after Washington to allow pot use without a doctor's recommendation. Both states prohibit public use of the drug.","Wendy Sachs, a married mother-of-two, tried weed with her husband while they were on vacation in Colorado, where it's legal .
