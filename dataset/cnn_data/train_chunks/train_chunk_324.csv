"(CNN) -- Gunfire struck nine people on Bourbon Street in New Orleans early Sunday, police spokesman Frank Robertson said. The shooting happened at 2:45 a.m. in the French Quarter. Initial reports had indicated that seven people were injured in the incident. Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department Ronal Serpas said Sunday that the shooting may have occurred due to a heated exchange between two young men. ""Right now, we believe they did exchange gunfire,"" he said at a press conference. ""Those two young men choose to hurt each other and put other people at risk."" The victims were taken to two different hospitals in the area. Two of the victims are in critical condition, Serpas said. The other seven are in stable condition and suffered non-life-threatening injuries, Robertson said. Additional information on the victims has not been released so far, but Serpas said some of them were not from New Orleans. Investigators are reviewing evidence and surveillance video, but have not established a motive for the shooting. Police are urging neighboring businesses and any eyewitnesses to turn in video or evidence that might help them catch those responsible for the shooting, according to Serpas. ""This is a heinous crime. These are two young men, both armed with firearms, who chose to settle a dispute between themselves without a moment's care for anyone else,"" Serpas said. ""I hope that they are listening. I hope that their friends are listening. I hope their moms and them are listening."" The 700 block, where the shooting occurred, is a popular gathering place for tourists and revelers, where many of them pack bars and clubs between St. Peter and St. Ann Streets. Crowds often spill into the streets. The scene is around the corner from other famed attractions, such as jazz concert venue Preservation Hall and the popular bar Pat O'Brien's. CNN's Carma Hassan and Patrick Cornell contributed to this story.","NEW: Police believe two young men are responsible for the shooting .

"(CNN) -- A new audio tape allegedly from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden claims responsibility for an attempt to blow up a plane en route to Michigan on Christmas Day and warns the United States of more attacks. The tape, which aired on the Arabic-language news Web site Al-Jazeera on Sunday, says ""the United States will not dream of enjoying safety until we live it in reality in Palestine."" The tape continues: ""It is not fair to enjoy that kind of life while our brothers in Gaza live in the worst of miseries."" CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the message, but the CIA has in the past confirmed Al-Jazeera reports on tapes from the al Qaeda leader. President Obama's senior adviser David Axelrod told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that while there was no immediate confirmation that the message was authentic, it ""contains the same hollow justification for the slaughter of innocent people."" In another section of the audio tape that Al-Jazeera broadcast, the voice says: ""God willing our attacks will continue as long as you support the Israelis and may peace be on those who follow guidance."" Bin Laden also claims responsibility for the foiled attack on Delta flight 253 in December. ""The message intended to be sent to you was through the hero fighter Omar Farouq, may God release him, confirming an earlier message that the [September] 11th heroes delivered to you and it was repeated before and after [that event],"" he says. A Nigerian man, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, has been charged with attempting to blow up the Delta Airlines plane as it approached Detroit from Amsterdam, Netherlands. ""Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the failed attack on Christmas Day. That's clear,"" a U.S. counterterrorism official -- who is not authorized to speak publicly -- told CNN. ""So a message like this -- no matter whose voice it may be -- should come as no surprise. Al Qaeda has, from time to time, tried to build support for its program of murder by talking about the Palestinian issue. That line's never gotten them much in the past, and it's unlikely to now, either."" Bin Laden had six messages in 2009. The last was on September 25 and was ""to the European people."" In that message, he urged the countries to reconsider their involvement in the Afghanistan war. ""Today Europe is suffering an economic crisis, and its export reputation doesn't hold true anymore, while America is bleeding economically because of all the wars it is involved in,"" his last message said. ""Think about how Europe will fare when America pulls out of Afghanistan. You will be left to suffer alone the rage of the people you oppressed."" A security expert said there's a possibility bin Laden did not know about the attempted attack in December and al Qaeda branches may be using it to prove themselves to the group's leadership. ""They were able to get their man on an American plane on an American soil so it is successful by all means,"" said Mustafa Al-Ani at the Gulf Research Center. ""The strategy is there, outlined by the mother leadership and now we will see the branches doing their best to please their leadership and implement al Qaeda vision in their own ways."" Bin Laden is thought to be hiding in the Pakistan-Afghanistan mountain region, according to intelligence experts.","NEW: Obama aide says tape tries to justify ""slaughter of innocent people""

"(CNN) -- A German entrepreneur claims to have found a way to buy 1 million air miles for as little as $6,500. Those air miles could translate into two first or business class trips on Etihad Airways from the United States to the Maldives, or up to five return first class trips to Asia on Singapore Airlines. Best part: he says anyone could do the same. The scheme, hatched by Torsten Jacobi, principal owner of Bluusun Media which runs travel deals website mightytravels.com, involves applying for credit cards that offer generous sign-up and spending bonuses and then buying gift cards with the credit cards, which you immediately liquidate back into cash. As long as you pay off your credit cards in full each month, that amounts to thousands of air miles for the price of the gift and credit card fees, which in his scheme amount to around $6,500 over the course of a year. Cards for miles . ""It requires just two credit cards that most people will be easily eligible for and a couple of minutes of your time every day for a 12-month period,"" he told CNN. By using the Citibank Executive AAdvantage World Elite MasterCard and the American Express Gold Card, which offer generous sign-up bonuses and redemption benefits, and using them to buy $1,500-worth of gift cards each day, Jacobi says he is already 150,000 miles toward his goal of 1 million air miles. He has only researched the scheme in the United States so far, and you may need to register for an online payment system such as EvolveMoney. But if you've got the time, this could be a cheap ticket to a first class flight across the world, he says. ""If you manage to buy an average of $1,500 of gift cards every day and use Citibank and Evolve Money to liquidate your gift cards, three gift cards per day [for a year] equals $6,186.75 in fees, plus a $250 partial credit card fee. ""Miles earned: 765,000 American Express Membership Rewards points and 182,500 AAdvantage miles. Since both credit cards have a sign-up bonus, you'll actually earn a total of 282,500 AAdvantage miles and 790,000 American Express points."" So what's the catch? ""It's 100% legal. However stores could stop selling gift cards with a credit card. That has happened, but it's very easy to find supermarkets/gas stations who are allowing that volume of sales per day; $1,500 is small -- I have done up to $5,000 per store several days in a row."" Jacobi even has preferred routes to get the most of his air miles once they're earned. ""[My] recommendation would be to use the AAdvantage miles for a trip for two to the Maldives or Sri Lanka with Etihad Airways or Cathay Pacific First Class. For both airlines the surcharges/fees are minimal. ""As for Membership Rewards, the most luxurious option is Singapore Airlines' [frequent flyer program] KrisFlyer to Hong Kong. This can be had for around 150,000 one-way when redeemed online. ""American Express Membership Rewards transfer instantly to KrisFlyer. Taxes and fees come to about $250 per round-trip ticket.""","German entrepreneur says he is 150,000 miles into a 1 million air mile target .
Scheme involves buying gift cards with air mile-linked credit cards, and immediately liquidating the cash .
Only researched for United States so far, but is good for first class flights on various airlines ."
"(EW.com) -- Ever wonder what AMC's ultra-violent hit ""The Walking Dead"" would be like if it was edited for a broadcast network instead?

"(CNN) -- Actor Michael Douglas made headlines on Monday after telling The Guardian that his throat cancer may have been caused by the human papillomavirus transmitted through oral sex. The link between oral sex, HPV and cancer has been receiving more attention in recent years. HPV is a virus that's transmitted through sexual contact -- genital or oral. There are more than 40 types, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and approximately 79 million Americans are currently infected. Most people have no symptoms. ""HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives,"" the CDC's website states. ""In most cases, the virus goes away and it does not lead to any health problems. There is no certain way to know which people infected with HPV will go on to develop cancer."" Douglas' publicist told CNN that the actor did not intend to point to HPV as the sole cause of his throat cancer, but was suggesting it as one possible cause. Did oral sex bring about Michael Douglas' cancer diagnosis? Not exactly . HPV is thought to cause 1,700 oropharyngeal, or throat, cancers in women and 6,700 oropharyngeal cancers in men each year, according to the CDC. Tobacco and alcohol use may play a role in who develops cancer from the virus, the government agency notes. A 2011 study found that the proportion of oropharyngeal cancers related to HPV increased from 16.3% to 71.7% between 1984 and 2004. Data presented that same year at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting suggested HPV was overtaking tobacco as the leading cause of oral cancers in Americans under the age of 50. The virus is transmissible regardless of whether the sexual contact is heterosexual or homosexual. Approximately 42,000 people in the United States will be newly diagnosed with oral cancer in 2013, according to the Oral Cancer Foundation. This includes neck, mouth and throat cancers. When they're found early, oral cancers have an 80 to 90% survival rate, the foundation says. ""Patients with HPV-positive cancers have better survival rates,"" Dr. Anil Chaturvedi of the National Cancer Institute told CNN in 2011. ""The precise reasons for the survival benefits are not clear, but tumors in HPV-positive patients tend to have less genetic damage. Because of that, they are more responsive to cancer therapies like radiation treatment."" The CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend both boys and girls get the HPV vaccine between the ages of 11 and 12. Doctors say the vaccine is most effective if administered before a child becomes sexually active. HPV has also been linked to cervical cancer, penile cancer and anal cancer, according to the CDC. The HPV vaccine prevents the most common types of the virus. There are two approved for use in the United States: Gardasil and Cervarix. Of course, HPV is not the only danger of having unprotected oral sex. Sexually transmitted diseases like herpes, syphilis, gonorrhea and HIV can be also be spread through the act. To stay safe, the CDC recommends always using a condom and getting tested regularly. ""The good news is that all STIs are preventable and most are curable,"" writes Gail Bolan, the CDC's director of STD prevention division. ""But, because most STIs have no symptoms, testing is the necessary first step to treatment.""","There are more than 40 types of the human papillomavirus .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Richard Dawson, the longtime host of ""Family Feud"" known for planting kisses on female contestants, has died, his son said in a statement Sunday. He was 79. ""It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my father passed away this evening from complications due to esophageal cancer,"" Gary Dawson said in a post on his Facebook page. ""He was surrounded by his family. He was an amazing talent, a loving husband, a great dad, and a doting grandfather. He will be missed but always remembered."" Dawson died Saturday night at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, his son said. Dawson was the show's host from its premiere in 1976 until 1985. He also hosted the show's 1994-1995 season. Dawson told the Archive of American Television in a 2010 interview that his trademark move started early on in the show's run, when he saw a woman shaking as she struggled to come up with the name of a green vegetable. ""I said, 'I'm gonna do something that my mom would do to me whenever I had a problem of any kind. ... And I kissed her on the cheek, and I said, 'That's for luck.' And she said, 'Asparagus.' ... They went on to win,"" he said. Always wearing a flower on his lapel, Dawson was also known for his witty banter with the contestants. He said in the Archive of American Television interview that he always tried to be fair and encourage the players. Following an answer, Dawson would yell, ""Survey says ..."" as the contestants and television audience waited to see whether their answer appeared on the board. Overheard on CNN.com: Richard Dawson, TV 'Hero' and smooching game-show host . ""The thing that I loved about 'Feud,' we froze a moment in time for these families that had never occurred before,"" he said, adding the show would furnish families with videotapes of the show. ""That's magic,"" he said. Dawson was born November 20, 1932, in Gosport, Hampshire, England, as Colin Lionel Emm. When he was 14, he joined the Merchant Marines for three years before starting his career as a stand-up comedian in London -- changing his name along the way. In the early 1960s, he appeared on television shows including ""Steve Allen"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" but it was his performance as a military prisoner in the film ""King Rat"" that led to his role as Cpl. Peter Newkirk, a cockney prisoner of war, on the CBS sitcom ""Hogan's Heroes,"" his son said. It was that role that introduced Dawson to American audiences. The show ran ""six years ... a year longer than Hitler,"" Dawson once said, according to his son. Dawson became a regular on the game shows ""Match Game"" and ""Match Game PM,"" and was hired to host his first game show, ""Masquerade Party,"" his son said. In 1976, however, he was hired as the host of ""Family Feud."" ""At the height of its success, 'Feud' was both the number-one daytime show and the number-one syndicated television show, becoming one of the most popular game shows ever,"" another post on Gary Dawson's Facebook page said. The game show aired 11 times a week and also aired 20 primetime specials featuring celebrities. Its success made Dawson television's highest-paid game show host, his son said. Dawson said in the interview it was very important to him ""that I could kiss and touch all people. To say kiss, it sounds crazy, but they're all people and that's how I saw them, whether I liked them or didn't like them."" He said he never thought twice about a contestant's race. ""When I first came here, Petula Clark was on a show with Nat King Cole and he kissed her on the cheek, and 81 stations in the South canceled him. I kissed black women daily and nightly (on ""Family Feud"") for 11 years and the world didn't come to an end, did it?"" Dawson and his first wife, British actress Diana Dors, had divorced in the late 1960s, according to his son. In the Archive of American Television interview, Dawson discussed meeting his second wife, Gretchen Johnson, when she was a contestant on ""Family Feud."" ""I knew there was just something about this young lady and myself,"" he said. He asked her afterward if he could call her, he said. At one point, when Johnny Carson was considering retiring as host of ""The Tonight Show,"" Dawson was considered as a replacement, and hosted the show for a week, Gary Dawson said. Carson ultimately decided not to retire. Later, Dawson appeared in the film ""The Running Man"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger. ""He was loved by millions of Americans as a television icon, but loved even more as a husband, a father and grandfather by his family,"" Gary Dawson said. In the Archive of American Television interview, Dawson recalled Schwarzenegger as a nice person, but said he was an ""awful governor."" Dawson is survived by his two sons with Dors, Mark and Gary, along with his wife Gretchen, their daughter Shannon and four grandchildren, Gary Dawson said. Asked in the 2010 interview what he thought of game shows today, Dawson said, ""I don't find any soul in those shows. I'm not being noble."" He poked fun at himself, saying, ""What a grouch. He's turned into a grouch."" On how he would like to be remembered, Dawson said, ""Alive and well."" He then added, ""... that I did care. Probably not as much as I should. It's easy to duck out of things, but lots of things touch me and I try to help some people ... that I was kind, and I was a nice person. You wouldn't want to move if you sat next to me on the bus. Or maybe you would."" People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived .","Richard Dawson was 79 .

"(CNN) -- This month, if everything goes according to schedule, your Internet service provider may begin monitoring your account, just to make sure you aren't doing anything wrong with it -- like sharing copyrighted movie or music files. While we might all agree that copyright holders need to be protected, we may not all be equally happy about all of our communications being checked for violations. People and businesses who are not doing anything illegal may still have some things they wish to hide from their Internet access providers. Under normal circumstances, your Internet service provider, or ISP, tries to protect you and your data from spying eyes. Cablevision, Time Warner Cable (an independent company no longer directly affiliated with TimeWarner, the parent of CNN and this site) and Comcast utilize all sorts of software to keep the connections between our modems and their servers safe. They also encourage us to keep our home networks secure from eavesdroppers. But what are we supposed to do when the eavesdropper is the ISP itself? This is the most disturbing question raised by a new alliance among America's biggest ISPs and media giants such as Disney, Sony and Fox, which is to go into effect this month. The effort, dubbed the Center for Copyright Information, hopes to combat the illegal downloading and sharing of movies and music by monitoring it at the source - your computer. Until now, it was up to movie and music companies to figure out when their stuff was being illegally shared. This was a little tricky, because files aren't stored on just one user's computer. Hundreds or thousands of sharers have bits and pieces of stolen files, for downloaders to reassemble into songs or movies. So movie companies have been searching online for copies of their own movies, identifying the locations of everyone from whom they received a bit of data. Then they contact the Internet service providers, who send letters of warning to subscribers' homes. A number of clever workarounds, including certain kinds of encryption or the use of ""proxy"" servers in other countries, have helped advanced users of file-sharing software stay one step ahead of the movie companies. If a file sharer appears to be working out of New Guinea, say, the movie studio can't rely on a friendly ISP to find an illegal downloader here in the United States. As I understand the new agreement and subsequent comments, which are about as cryptic as a copy-protected DVD, ISP's have agreed to implement a standardized ""graduated response plan"" through which offending users are warned, restricted and eventually cut off from the Internet for successive violations. The companies are supposed to be developing systems that keep track of all this, so that the letters and usage restrictions happen automatically. The fact that they are all agreeing to participate makes it harder for any one company to win the disgruntled customers of those who have been disciplined by another. But now that they're free from individual blame, there's also the strong possibility that the ISPs will be doing the data monitoring directly. That's a much bigger deal. So instead of reaching out to the Internet to track down illegally flowing bits of their movies, the studios will sit back while ISP's ""sniff"" the packets of data coming to and from their customers' computers. While they're simply claiming to be protecting copyright holders, ISPs have a lot to gain from all this as well. For instance, in many cases the Internet subscriber might have no knowledge of the infraction that the ISP detects. A houseguest might log onto one's home network simply to check e-mail. Because his sharing software might be running in the background (even when he's not downloading files himself) he is in effect sharing his own movie files wherever he goes. Your ISP sniffs the packets, so you are nabbed. The same is true for those of us who run ""open networks"" so that neighbors and others nearby can get free Internet access when they need it. (In the old days, that used to be considered polite.) Once sharing a network connection becomes a legal liability, our already privatized access channels will become less a community resource. And the ISP's will have the pleasure of selling individual subscriptions to neighbors who used to share. Worse, subscribers will be losing their expectation of privacy from their own service providers. While most of us aren't too worried about someone at an Internet provider seeing our messages to Aunt Sophie, businesses, law firms or hospitals who use the Internet to communicate privileged information might have more reservations. If monitoring of data streams becomes de rigueur, what's to stop an ISP (or a particularly unscrupulous or bribable employee) from monitoring its competitors' communications? Admittedly, such scenarios are only as outlandish as the possibility that Murdoch newspapers could successfully bribe Scotland Yard. As Internet security expert Josh Klein explained to me, ""Honestly, the prohibition made more sense than this."" To protect his own data, he already uses servers outside the United States, and fears other companies may soon feel the need to do the same: ""The risk of losing their 'net [access] because someone accidentally streamed the wrong thing is a business prerogative significant enough to tunnel all their traffic to a country that provides sensible data privacy laws. How much long after that until the rest of the company gets off-shored?"" Whether the agreement promises to unleash such demons has yet to be seen. For the time being, though, the practice of preventing abuse by restricting peer-to-peer activity appears doomed only to escalate the arms race between consumers and their producers. The longer term solution would be to develop an appropriate social contract: conducting ourselves online under the same civilized behavioral norms that keep us from, say, stealing stuff from one another's homes even though we could probably get away with it. It's not really that hard, and it's worth figuring out before the privilege of free interaction is taken away from us - along with any expectation of privacy. Only by strengthening people's ability to distinguish between sharing and stealing will we be able to build a society capable of surviving our networks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: Your Internet service provider may soon begin monitoring your account .

"(CNN) -- ""It takes me three days to recover after the Sevens,"" says referee Robert Esser, who's called the plays at the famed Hong Kong rugby tournament for 12 years. ""If you find out how to survive it, let me know."" The annual Hong Kong Sevens is the city's largest sporting event, attracting thousands of costumed revelers from all over the world. But making the most of the party atmosphere requires strategy and planning. With the Sevens on March 28-30, experts and hardcore fans have shared tips on how they'll be getting through the three-day mega party. 1. South Stand commitment mandatory . Ask not what the South Stand can do for you, but what you can do for the South Stand. The only large public area where Sevens revelers can drink alcohol, the legendary South Stand brings together Hong Kong Stadium's most passionate spectators -- all dedicated to having an outrageously good time. The pros advise arriving before 9 a.m. on the first two days, and as early as 7 a.m. for the Sunday finals. The stand fills up quickly so you'll be stuck in a long line if you're late. Costumes are the norm and controlled bladders are a must if you want to keep your spot in the South Stand. Once you're in, be prepared to have things thrown your way, from rugby balls to jugs of beer and other nondescript fluids. ""Despite the boozy reputation, the South Stand remains remarkably fun and harmless, except for the liver,"" says one frequent fan. 2. Serious rugby fans head for the East and West Stands . ""Don't be afraid to go to the East and West Stands, because that's where everyone goes to watch the rugby,"" says 28-year-old rugby player Rowan Varty, who has taken part in the Sevens since he was born as both a spectator and a player. ""That's where you get the best view,"" adds his sister Lindsay Varty, 25, who plays on the Hong Kong women's rugby team. ""Our parents always sit at the bottom left side of the West Stand near the North Stand. Sometimes, they go higher up for a better view."" 3. For costumes, (almost) anything goes . The pros advise against wearing heavy suits, big masks and hats that'll have you drenched in sweat and blocking other people's views. ""If you dress up as a polar bear in 20-something-degree weather, you're going to suffer,"" says rugby player Tsang Hing Hung, 29, who has watched and played at the Hong Kong Sevens for the last 15 years. And let your ideas run wild. ""I'm pretty sure every year, there are going to be people dressed as crayons and ballerinas,"" says Rowan Varty. ""If you come up with something original, you stand a better chance of getting in the newspaper."" ""The outfits often prove an irrelevant socio-cultural-political barometer -- think of patches of North Korean leaders, Vladimir Putins and Justin Biebers,"" adds another fan. 4. Walk to the stadium . Roads are blocked and taxis are scarce. Once you arrive anywhere near Causeway Bay, start walking. The nearest MTR subway station to the Hong Kong Stadium is Causeway Bay. Go to exit F, which takes you to a spot directly across from Forever 21. From there, join the crowds and walk up Caroline Hill Road to get to Hong Kong Stadium. It's about a 15-20 minute walk. ""As you get closer and closer to the stadium, you see all the people coming from everywhere dressed in their costumes, and it's quite a sight,"" says Rowan Varty. ""It's one of the things we look forward to when we take the team bus."" 5. Pace yourself . Winnie Poon, a fan who has been to the Hong Kong Sevens five times, has her own sage advice for fans -- pace yourselves. Go overboard too early in the day and you run the risk of passing out next to a toilet many others have thrown up in, she says. Also worth bearing in mind -- it's a three-day event so you'll need to get up early the next morning to avoid spending the entire day in lines. ""A lot of people spend too much time queuing for beer,"" says Esser. ""It's better to watch the games live than from a screen."" 6. Avoid the food stalls . Have a large breakfast before entering the stadium and hopefully you'll last the day, says Lindsay Varty. Matches only go on for 15 minutes and you could miss an entire game while waiting for a hot dog. ""Go out and eat,"" says referee Stephan Lehner, who is on his 11th year with the Sevens. ""The food in the stadium is all right, but it's a lot of fast food. There are plenty of decent places outside the stadium."" 7. Ladies, bring binoculars . For some, watching athletic young men run around on a field is as much a spectacle as the game itself, if not more. Zoom in, zoom out and spot this year's hottest rugby men with a bit of help. ""Those players look a lot closer with binoculars,"" says Amanda Wilson, a fan who has attended the Sevens for more than 20 years. 8. South Standers, stay waterproof . Expect a high chance of beer, cider, water and bodily fluid showers at the South Stand. Bring an umbrella, waterproof clothes and leave your expensive camera behind. It may rain, literally, but that's the least of your concerns. ""There are always really drunk people,"" says Lindsay Varty. ""So watch out for flying jugs and cups. They're not always full of beer."" ""Ladies, wear closed-toe shoes unless you don't mind all manner of liquid between your toes,"" advises marketing executive Stephanie Szeto, who is about to enjoy her sixth year at the Sevens. 9. You can still enjoy the Sevens outside the stadium . If you didn't score tickets, there's always the Sevens Village at the Indian Recreation Club directly opposite Hong Kong Stadium. The party is just as lively and rugby fans watch the games broadcast live on a giant screen for free. It has food stalls, a pub and vendors selling rugby memorabilia. ""There's also the HK Fan Zone at the New Central Harbourfront, where you can watch singers perform and the games broadcast live outdoors,"" says Tsang. This year, De La Soul, jazz artist Allen Youngblood and local rock band Mr. will make appearances. 10. Wan Chai offers the best after-party . After the games, the fun continues in Hong Kong's Lan Kwai Fong, Soho and Wan Chai neighborhoods. The real rugby fans and party crowd head to Wan Chai. ""Everybody's there and the streets are packed with people still in crazy costumes,"" says Lindsay Varty. ""It's a great photo opportunity and lots of fun.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A 54-year-old acting coach, who's also appeared in bit parts in movies such as ""Jurassic Park,"" has been charged with kidnapping and raping a girl who approached him for lessons, authorities said. Cameron Thor was charged this week in connection with the attack on a 13-year-old girl in 2008, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said.

"(CNN) -- The amount of education a person has plays a big role when it comes to deciding whether to make a long-term commitment to that special someone or to have a child outside of marriage, a new report says. The 2010 edition of ""The State of Our Unions"" -- a report on attitudes toward marriage -- indicates highly educated Americans are ""embracing a pro-marriage mindset"" even as middle Americans lose faith in the institution. That shift resembles trends normally seen in the poor, where marriage is ""fragile and weak,"" according to the report, issued Monday . The findings show moderately educated women, or those with a high school diploma and some post-secondary education but no four-year degree, are choosing the single life more often these days, especially when it comes to becoming a mother. According to the report, ""in the early '80s, 13% of babies of moderately educated mothers and 33% of babies of least-educated mothers were born outside of marriage, while 2% were born to highly educated mothers.'' In recent years, the numbers soared to 44% for moderately educated mothers and 54% for the least educated mothers. For mothers with a four-year college degree, births outside of marriage increased to only 6%. Highly educated women also are getting married more and staying in those relationships longer, according to the report, which suggests this is a ""striking reversal of historic trends"" The report cites an adherence to a ""marriage mindset,"" which means religious attendance and faith in marriage is now a way of life for the highly educated. The same couldn't be said for Middle Americans. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the report says, divorce or separation within the first 10 years of marriage decreased for the highly educated from 15% to 11% and fell from 46% to 36% for the least educated, but was nearly steady for the moderately educated, moving from 36% percent up to 37%. ""The State of Our Unions,"" released by the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia and the Center for Marriage and Families at the Institute for American Values, was authored by sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox of the University of Virginia. ""The retreat from marriage in Middle America means that all too many Americans will not be able to realize the American Dream,"" he said. ""On average, marriage plays a key role in securing the welfare of children,"" said Wilcox, who added that studies show ""children are much more likely to thrive if they are raised in a married home with their own mother and father."" Three national surveys were used to compile the final report. They were the General Social Survey, which conducts basic scientific research on the structure and development of American society; the National Survey of Family Growth, which gathers information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men's and women's health; and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a federally funded program at the University of North Carolina. According to Wilcox, it's the first to address the causes of the ""observed retreat from marriage in Middle America,"" and finds that shifts in marriage attitudes, increases in unemployment and declines in religious attendance are among the trends driving the retreat. ""Marriage has gotten weaker"" with the decline of churches and civic group in communities, he said, adding that more outreach is needed in areas where these connections are lacking. He also called on society to do a better job of pointing out the advantages of marriage, particularly when it comes to having children.","Middle Americans are losing faith in marriage, while highly educated adults embrace it .

"North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Focused, determined and dedicated: that's how friends and neighbors describe Nicolas Checque, the Navy SEAL killed during the successful rescue of an American doctor kidnapped in Afghanistan. They say when the petty officer first class died, Checque was living the life he had always wanted. As far back as middle school, he knew he wanted to join the Navy's special forces. ""He loved it,"" said high school classmate Anthony Troisi. ""In seventh grade, eighth grade, he knew what he wanted to do with his life: he wanted to be a Navy SEAL."" Read more: U.S. citizen rescued from the Taliban in Afghanistan . He was driven and goal-oriented, according to Stephanie Stewart, who usually rode the school bus with Checque to Norwin High School. ""He knew exactly how to get where he wanted,"" she said. Growing up here, Checque kept a short, military-style haircut, and even got Lasik eye surgery -- mainly to make sure there was nothing that could disqualify him from becoming a commando, according to Troisi. In addition to his classes, the young man focused on wrestling and fitness, which friends say he saw as a way to prepare for the physically demanding role Checque was striving for. ""He was a team leader,"" said Michael Choby, who graduated a year ahead. ""Not a superstar, but a leader in the room -- and at matches, too."" Send memories or messages . At the end of an exhausting wrestling practice, Checque was still ready to swim laps, Choby said -- another type of training that could help lead to a career as a commando. Troisi described him as mentally tough, but reserved, at matches. ""He would beat a guy up -- and then walk off like it was just his job,"" he said. Checque was a four-year honors student, said his physics teacher Doug Knipple, but rather than go to college, he chose to go straight into the Navy. At Norwin on Tuesday morning, students, faculty and staff observed a moment of silence. Choby, who now works as the assistant principal at the school they both attended, says Checque's accomplishments can serve as an example for today's students. ""He didn't just have a dream, and wish it happened, or hope it happened. He worked, worked, worked-- and he achieved amazing things for himself,"" he said. Home and Away: Coalition casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq . In addition to winning a coveted slot in the elite special warfare unit known as SEAL Team Six, Checque, 28, received a number of commendations, including the Bronze Star. But when the Monroeville resident visited home in recent years, he did not talk about his assignments or his missions, said former neighbor Kim Victor. After al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed by American commandos in Pakistan, old high school friends joked about how Checque was probably involved. Now, Troisi said, they know the truth: Checque actually did serve in the very unit from which the soldiers on that high-stakes mission were selected. (The Pentagon has not disclosed whether Checque was on the bin Laden mission) The International Security Assistance Force said Taliban insurgents kidnapped the rescued U.S. doctor. Two local officials identified the kidnappers as smugglers. ""He died doing what he loved,"" former neighbor Kim Victor said of Checque. ""Not that that makes it any easier."" Checque's remains were returned to U.S. soil at Dover Air Force Base on Monday, as officials ranging from President Barack Obama to the rescued doctor's employer thanked him for his sacrifice.

"(CNN) -- Indonesia's government has stepped in at the eleventh hour to help save an Indonesian woman on death row in Saudi Arabia from being executed this weekend. Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad, a 40-year old working as a housemaid in the Gulf kingdom, was sentenced to death in 2011 after she reportedly admitted to killing her 70-year-old female employer and stealing approximately $10,000. She said it was in self-defense as her boss had been trying to attack her at the time. She was facing execution on Saturday unless the dead woman's family received 7 million Saudi riyals ($1.8 million) in financial compensation, known as diyya or ""blood money."" A pardon would likely follow if the payment is made. Campaigners in Indonesia had raised just over half that sum with donations coming from the public, businesses and NGOs, Jakarta's Foreign Ministry said in a statement last week. But on Thursday, a statement on the official website of the Indonesian President's Cabinet Secretariat confirmed that Indonesia's government would pay the full amount -- a figure that had been negotiated down from an initial request of 10 million Saudi riyals, Indonesian Foreign Ministry official Tatang Budie Utama Razak told CNN in February. ""With the government's offer to pay 7 million riyals, Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs, Djoko Suyanto, said Satinah has been saved from the death penalty, at the Buraidah prison in Saudi Arabia,"" the statement read. The statement quoted Suyanto as saying a task force representing the Indonesian government had met with Saudi officials and the dead woman's family on Wednesday when a figure was agreed. He did not confirm whether the family had made any additional demands. Saudi authorities have yet to confirm whether the execution will be canceled. Letter to the King . The execution was initially scheduled for August 2011 but has been postponed five times due to the intervention of the Indonesian government, Jakarta's Foreign Ministry said. Yudhoyono has written King Abdullah twice over the last two years, while Ahmad's brother and daughter have also written a letter to the victim's family, according to the ministry. Some 41 other Indonesian workers face possible death sentences in Saudi Arabia on charges ranging from black magic to stealing, adultery and murder, according to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry and local nonprofit groups. In 2011, Indonesian housemaid Darsem Binti Dawud Tawar was pardoned after the Indonesian government paid the required compensation of 2 million riyals ($533,000). She had been sentenced to death two years before for murdering a relative of her Yemeni employer in Saudi Arabia. She claimed she acted in self-defense after he allegedly tried to rape her. Ruyati Binti Sapubi, also an Indonesian maid working in Saudi Arabia, was executed in June 2011 for allegedly killing her employer. Her beheading caused public outrage in Indonesia and a diplomatic protest when Saudi authorities did not inform Jakarta of the date of her execution. Moratorium . The Indonesian government later announced a full moratorium on sending workers to the Gulf kingdom, which ended in February when the two governments signed a new agreement guaranteeing domestic workers a monthly wage, time off and contact with loved ones. Human rights groups say the pact is a step toward ensuring the protection of foreign workers' basic rights in Saudi Arabia. But it fails to address a worrying trend of domestic helpers filing complaints of exploitation and abuse, only to face counterallegations by their employers of ""theft, witchcraft or adultery,"" according to Human Rights Watch. The penalties for these crimes are harsh in the deeply conservative kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which practices a puritanical form of Islam. Around 1.5 million women -- mostly from Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines -- work in Saudi Arabia as domestic workers, according to Human Rights Watch. They make up less than a quarter of the kingdom's 8 million foreign workers but account for most of the complaints received by embassies of sending countries, the organization said. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian and Paul Armstrong contributed to this report.","NEW: Indonesian government agrees to pay $1.8M to family of murdered Saudi woman .

"(CNN) -- A giant yellow duck on display at Taiwan's Keelung Port is finding little to be happy about this New Year's Day. The famed 18-meter inflatable art installation, created by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, burst and deflated on Tuesday, leaving locals shocked and disappointed. The duck's demise came only 11 days after it arrived in Keelung City Harbor, the latest in a multi-city Taiwan tour for the celebrity bird. There are multiple theories as to what led to the New Year's Eve tragedy. Murder most fowl? According to Taiwan media reports, one tourist claims she saw what looked like an eagle scratch the rubber duck with its talons. If that's indeed the case, jealousy could very well have been the motivation behind this unprovoked attack. Meanwhile, a meteorologist speculates an unseasonal dose of sunshine may have overheated the duck, disrupting its internal pressure after weeks of cold, rainy conditions, leading to its rupture. ""We want to apologize to the fans of the yellow rubber duck,"" said Keelung City Council Speaker Huang Ching-ta while addressing media. ""We haven't found the cause of the burst. We will carefully examine the duck to determine the cause."" (Photos of the damaged duck can be viewed on Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo.) Fortunately for fans, the city says it plans to borrow another copy of the floating art installation, due to be installed by Saturday at the earliest. More: Giant duck conquers Taiwan . A turbulent past . Versions of the famous duck have previously taken up temporary residence in cities all over the world, including Beijing, Osaka, Sydney, Sao Paolo and Amsterdam. After stirring up a craze in Hong Kong in May and June, followed by a two-month stint in Beijing, the 18-meter inflatable duck arrived in Taiwan in September. It was docked at Kaohsiung City until October 20, before floating to Taoyuan then its recent spot in Keelung in northern Taiwan. Tuesday's deflation is the latest in a string of unfortunate duck-related incidents. In May of 2013, Hong Kong's version of the giant duck mysteriously lost its mojo one night, leaving its deflated yellow shell bobbing lifelessly in Victoria Harbour. In late October, the Taoyuan version deflated then exploded during an attempt to re-inflate it. In 2009 during a port call in Belgium, it was stabbed 42 times by a vandal. ""We don't know why the person did it,"" artist Hofman said in an earlier interview with CNN. ""But [the incident] brought the people of that town together. The community had a stake out at night and protected it and even the police looked after it. It shows that this piece of art means a lot to people in the vicinity of this work.""

"(CNN) -- For his efforts to protect Haitian children from parasites, Aaron Jackson was honored as a CNN Hero in 2007. His story inspired actor Rainn Wilson, who became involved with Jackson's organization, Planting Peace. Since 2004, Planting Peace has helped millions of children around the world through its deworming project called Stomp the Worm. It also has formed several children's homes in Haiti and India. CNN's Christie O'Reilly recently caught up with Jackson to talk about his group's expanding efforts and his collaboration with Wilson. O'Reilly: What success has your group had with Stomp the Worm? Jackson: When CNN Heroes highlighted our project, it brought a tremendous amount of awareness to the cause. We had dewormed 1.7 million children at the time. Last year alone, we dewormed 8 million. Most people know us for our worm initiative in Haiti, but we've dewormed in Nicaragua, Honduras, Bolivia, Guatemala. We've also treated a half million in North Korea. Now we're trying to work on a fund where we deworm 1 million children a month. We're purchasing the medication now at 1.3 cents, so we can deworm around 66 kids for $1. O'Reilly: Why is deworming so important? Jackson: You can see hungry children eating three times a day, and if they're not dewormed they're still lethargic, have high rates of anemia. They're slowly wasting away. We can provide a treatment that's just over 1 cent, and the kids come back to life within a day or two. Seeing these kids run around after being dewormed, it's an amazing thing. And then you reflect that, ""Wow, this cost us one penny."" We didn't invent the deworming initiative, but we are happy to get it out there and show people the importance of it. ... We'd love for people to help us reach our 1-million-a-month goal. O'Reilly: How many children's homes has Planting Peace opened, and how do they work? Jackson: We now have seven children's homes: four in Haiti and three in India. We're working on a fourth in India now for refugee children from Tibet. We're opening it in Dharamsala, where the Dalai Lama lives. Maybe he'll come visit us. That would be awesome. We keep our homes small. We have a rule: no more than 10 (children) in each home, because we want to keep them very family-style. We try to keep the kids growing up like brothers and sisters. If we want to expand to help more children, we open another home. One of the homes in India is for handicapped children. One in Haiti is for HIV-positive children. Are you making a difference in your community? Share your story in a short video. O'Reilly: How are your homes impacting children's lives? Jackson: Some of these kids we've had for about eight years. It's amazing seeing these kids grow up and seeing what they're able to do. They have possibilities. Some of them came from the Cite Soleil slum. (Now) they're healthy. We have a school they're enrolled in. They participate in music five days a week; we more or less have our orphan band in Haiti. They have a chance at life and hopefully will become future leaders of Haiti or elsewhere. We have a policy where we don't adopt our kids out. We're not going to help Haiti -- or whatever country we're working in -- if we send the kids away. That might help that particular kid's situation, but not Haiti as a whole. O'Reilly: How did the earthquake impact your work in Haiti? Jackson: That really shook our foundation from all fronts. We were in the middle of our national deworming program and treating every child -- all 3.2 million kids -- and we had distributed half of that. If the earthquake had hit two weeks later, we would have gotten all the medication out to every child. It postponed the distribution; it shifted the population of the country so we didn't know what areas we had dewormed in (or) who we dewormed. We had to wait before passing out the meds again. O'Reilly: What about your children's homes? Jackson: We were extremely fortunate. All five buildings we own -- our school plus four homes -- all stood up. We had to move out of two of the homes, but we were very fortunate. No kids were hurt. One of our homes sits on a hill -- our HIV home -- and I was worried about that. When I got to Haiti, that home barely had a scratch on it and the two right next to it had collapsed. We were extremely, extremely fortunate. O'Reilly: What impact has Rainn Wilson's involvement had on your efforts? Jackson: Rainn has been extremely beneficial on all fronts, helping bring awareness and raise money for the cause. He's making the cause a little cooler now that he's a part of it. He's just been a great help. He's traveled to Haiti a couple times. He recently did a fundraiser to help us raise money to start a new orphanage. He's put us in contact with some amazing people that have helped us. O'Reilly: Where else will your travels take you this year? Jackson: I'm going to Ecuador in February. We're looking at a rainforest initiative there. We own some rainforest land in Peru -- 1,000 acres -- for preservation, and we're looking to do the same model in Ecuador. We purchased land in Peru about two and a half years ago. It's in the Amazon. Most people think that rainforest is being destroyed because people are going in and cutting trees. That is true on some level, but ... the forest is mostly being destroyed by cattle farming using a slash-and-burn technique. Farmers come in, buy the land and light it on fire and burn it down. Our goal is to purchase the land so no one can come in and destroy it. We leave it alone, and we watch over (it). It's said that two out of every 10 breaths we take come from the Amazon rainforest. It's important to preserve that for our future.","Aaron Jackson, a 2007 CNN Hero, has helped millions of children get dewormed .

"Washington (CNN) -- Since Barack Obama was first elected president in 2008, the word ""change"" was popular with Democrats who were seeking to win elected office. Obama effectively used it to tap into voters' disenchantment with President George W. Bush, and he ultimately swept into the White House in a watershed year for Democrats. But with the 2014 election on the horizon, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said this year's gubernatorial contests won't be about that operative word. Key gubernatorial races in 2014 . ""I am not so sure that this is the change election,"" Shumlin said Tuesday during an editorial board meeting with CNN. ""I think this is the election where voters care about one thing, middle class voters, both independents and Democrats, care about one thing: Did you or can you create better opportunities for us and our kids?"" The Democratic leader continued by stating that voters who have suffered through ""10 years of a stagnating economy"" and have slowly ""seen jobs trickle back,"" want to know what candidates are ""going to do to improve my wallet."" ""I don't think it is going to be a lofty, idealist change election,"" Shumlin concluded. 2014: What's at stake . Four years removed, the 2010 midterm election looms large over this November's contests. Republicans - in both Congress and in the states legislatures - won major gains by tapping into anti-Obama sentiment and riding the tea party wave. But those same Republicans now have to defend their wins -- Republican governors are left to defend 22 governorships in November compared to only 14 for Democrats. According to CNN's initial analysis, roughly half of this year's 36 races for governor could be competitive. Democrats are on the defensive in two highly competitive races, in Illinois and Arkansas, while Republicans are defending four toss-up races, in Florida, Maine, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Five races are ""tilting"" in favor of Democrats - Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island - and another five are ""tilting"" in favor of Republicans - Ohio, Arizona, New Mexico, South Carolina and Wisconsin. The other seven Democratic seats and 13 Republicans seats are considered safe. For Shumlin, the man in charge with ensuring Democrats make gains in November, the map is tiling in his favor. In particular, the Vermont governor said Democrats plan to use the way Republicans ran in 2010 against them. ""These guys got elected as the reformers, do you remember that?"" Shumlin said. ""In 2010, tea party governors got elected as reformers."" Shumlin went on to hit a number of Republican governors for ethics investigations and tax cuts for high-income earners. He said that the last four years of leadership from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker prove that Republicans aren't reformers. ""Any myth that these guys are reformers is officially dead,"" Shumlin said. By pressing a message centered on raising the minimum wage and strengthening the middle class, those campaigning for Democratic governors and candidates feel like they are in better position to make gains in 2014 than congressional Democrats, where it is looking more likely the Democrats will continue to be a minority in the House. Republicans, as expected, have a different view of the map. In a Tuesday statement, Jon Thompson, spokesman for the Republican Governors Association, said, ""While Democrat governors continue to raise taxes, increase spending, and waste hardworking taxpayers' money on failed Obamacare exchanges in their states, Republican governors are cutting taxes, lowering spending, balancing budgets, reforming education and driving the American Comeback."" Will GOP's Obamacare focus pay off? Why are some Dems running from Obamacare? Obama: Republicans 'were wrong' about Obamacare . Republicans also have bragging rights when it comes to money in the bank. The Republican Governors Association raised $23.5 million in the first quarter of 2014, nearly doubling the $12.5 million their Democratic counterpart brought in. The RGA haul was a record for the group and more than doubled what it raised in the first three months of 2010. ""RGA's strong financial position will give us the resources to push back against the public sector unions and the White House, who have targeted Republican governors and candidates for defeat,"" Phil Cox, the group's executive director said earlier this year. Democrats hope to make up those fundraising gaps in the coming months and are using a prolific Democratic fundraiser - former President Bill Clinton - to do just that. Clinton will headline a May fundraiser with Mike Ross, the Democratic gubernatorial hopeful in Arkansas, and the former President will also headline a DGA fundraiser for Charlie Crist in Miami on May 6. Hillary Clinton, however, has not been asked by the DGA for help in the midterms. Clinton, who left the State Department in early 2013 and is now considered the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 if she runs, has largely stayed away from highly political events in favor of paid speeches and corporate engagements. Shumlin downplayed the fact that Clinton has yet to campaign for the DGA and noted that she did help her longtime friend Terry McAuliffe, who ran and won the Virginia governor's mansion in 2013. ""The Clintons have been really helpful to us,"" Shumlin said. ""Obviously, you know Hillary is kind of laying a little bit low these last few months since she stopped being secretary of state but President Clinton has been hugely helpful. ... Everybody would love to have the Clintons help and we are getting it."" Meet the woman who could turn Texas purple . Haley's re-election bid: It's complicated . Kashkari mounts long-shot bid .

"(CNN) -- There are myriad ways to scrawl out the English language: loopy and slanting letters, tight and focused penmanship, and the ever-present chicken scratch, to name only a few. This was readily apparent when CNN solicited handwriting samples from iReporters as part of the cultural census. Some submitters favored the clean and simple script that denotes years of penmanship practice. Others had messy lettering and sentences tracing defiant diagonal trajectories off their guidelines. In the era before the printing press, handwriting was a highly specialized and labor-intensive monastic discipline, one undertaken only by those who had committed their lives to the church. Scribes worked painstakingly in a scriptorium, a room connected to a monastery's library where transcribers would spend their entire workday ensconced in one of the many cubiclelike recesses lining the walls. There, they inscribed letter after letter on sheets of parchment for months (or years) at a time -- all to produce a single book or manuscript. In the opinion of Arnie Sanders, associate professor of English at Goucher College in Baltimore, the history of handwriting is a perfect encapsulation of how the collision between the secular and the sacred has informed our literary traditions. ""It's impossible to say how many different styles of handwriting there were,"" he said. ""Each monastery would have its own scriptorium, if it was not extraordinarily poor. They had to reproduce the service books that they were wearing out. Some became specialists in doing this for other monasteries that were not as good at it. It takes a long time to produce manuscript books. ""The leaders of the scriptorium were looking for people who cared enough about books and writing to dedicate their entire lives to the process,"" he said. ""These skills were something that could carry you through your whole life. Once you learned how to do this, you weren't going to ever be sent out into the fields to mow hay or to plow. Books became the labor that you gave to God."" In all three of the Abrahamic faiths -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam -- handwriting is inexorably connected to religion and the worship of God . The scribe's duties were among the most sacred of religious tasks. ""The real purpose of writing was to propagate the word of God, and to regulate the worship of God,"" Sanders said. ""That's what kept handwriting alive, and why it was taught as a vocation."" Computers and calligraphy: Long-lost twins? A fitting analogy to the manuscript process is, ironically enough, computer programming. Though the two disciplines are separated by more than a millennium of history, they share fascinating similarities and parallels in their evolution, Sanders said. ""Who programs their own computer any more? In the olden days, when (Steve) Wozniak and (Steve) Jobs were out in the garage doing their thing, everyone had to program their own computer,"" Sanders said. ""That was the scriptorium of the modern era. Now we hire scribes to program for us. Modern computer users are in the 'Dilbert' era. The new scribe is the poor, underpaid and underappreciated programmer who's cranking out Microsoft Word revisions. ""In the early era, while scribes were still working to produce books, before the printing press, you just hired a scribe if you were rich,"" he continued. ""Even people who were literate didn't bother to write their own letters."" Indeed, until the mid-15th century, handwriting remained a specialized vocation mostly reserved for the church and the aristocratic classes. Only specialists could decode the then-standard Gothic script style, because only specialists needed to do so. Gothic lettering is famous for its complex and ornate style, which can be extremely confusing to the uninitiated. Every serious work of the time, including Geoffrey Chaucer's legendary ""Canterbury Tales,"" employed this script. Then, as the Renaissance movement began to take root in Europe, Continental Humanist writers began to revive Carolingian lettering, a form of script predating the Gothic style. Continental Humanists sought to apply Renaissance logic and critique to ancient texts, making the writing more digestible and accessible to a wider audience. Their ultimate goal was the ""wider distribution of their manuscript works about the pagan classics as well as to challenge Medieval religious orthodoxy,"" Sanders said. Carolingian script -- being much simpler, cleaner and easier to read than Gothic -- suited the Continental Humanists' purposes, and was popular enough to become the next step in the evolution of English writing. And just as with computers, this increased user-friendliness led to a massive proliferation of styles and formats. ""After that last burst of clarity, once literacy spreads beyond professional scribes to ordinary readers like you and me, manuscript writing becomes distorted and stretched out by the very difficult-to-read early modern cursive script of the 15th to 17th century,"" he said. ""This also leads to an explosion of different handwriting styles, the results of which you're seeing today. Look at modern writers' cursive signatures, and you're looking at a late form of this popularized script."" Where the sacred and the secular meet . Indeed, the history of handwriting can be summed up by this constant interplay and between script's religious roots and its secular applications. ""Literally, it's the power to control the pen, and the power to control what the pen perpetuates,"" Sanders said. ""People's interest in this debate about cursive handwriting, typing, texting and other incarnations of the language -- this is proof that these things still have the power to move us. It's the surest evidence you need for the importance of handwriting to the culture.""","Before printing press, handwriting a specialized, labor-intensive monastic discipline .

"(CNN) -- Anyone watching the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday night heard the number 4.5 million several times. ""Despite incredible odds and united Republican opposition, our president took action, and now we've seen 4.5 million new jobs,"" San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, the party's keynote speaker, said. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served as President Barack Obama's chief of staff, and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who followed Obama's November rival Mitt Romney as governor of Massachusetts, both cited the same number. Sights and sounds from the DNC . It's a big-sounding number, given the still-sputtering job market. So we're giving it a close eyeballing. The facts: . The number Castro cites is an accurate description of the growth of private-sector jobs since January 2010, when the long, steep slide in employment finally hit bottom. But while a total of 4.5 million jobs sounds great, it's not the whole picture. Nonfarm private payrolls hit a post-recession low of 106.8 million that month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figure currently stands at 111.3 million as of July. While that is indeed a gain of 4.5 million, it's only a net gain of 300,000 over the course of the Obama administration to date. The private jobs figure stood at 111 million in January 2009, the month Obama took office. And total nonfarm payrolls, including government workers, are down from 133.6 million workers at the beginning of 2009 to 133.2 million in July 2012. There's been a net loss of nearly 1 million public-sector jobs since Obama took office, despite a surge in temporary hiring for the 2010 census. Meanwhile, the jobs that have come back aren't the same ones that were lost. Are you better off? According to a study released last week by the liberal-leaning National Employment Law Project, low-wage fields such as retail sales and food service are adding jobs nearly three times as fast as higher-paid occupations. Conclusion: . The figure of 4.5 million jobs is accurate if you look at the most favorable period and category for the administration.

"(CNN) -- Joan Rivers remains on life support five days after suffering respiratory and cardiac arrest during a medical procedure, her daughter said Tuesday. Melissa Rivers has shared few details with the public about her mother's condition since she was rushed to Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital Thursday. ""On behalf of my mother and our family, we are extremely grateful for all the love and support we've received,"" she said in her latest statement. ""At this time she does remain on life support. I know my mother would be overwhelmed by the continued outpouring of kindness and I want to thank everyone for keeping us in their prayers."" The Rivers family's previous statement Sunday said they were ""keeping our fingers crossed."" The Cleveland Clinic explains what being on life support means: ""Life support replaces or supports a failing bodily function. When patients have curable or treatable conditions, life support is used temporarily until the illness or disease can be stabilized and the body can resume normal functioning. At times, the body never regains the ability to function without life support."" Rivers, 81, stopped breathing during throat surgery at a Manhattan medical clinic Thursday morning, according to the New York Fire Department. She apparently suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest during a procedure. She was listed in critical condition in New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, where paramedics took her by ambulance. Rivers was undergoing an apparently minor elective procedure at the clinic, which is about a mile away from the hospital where she was taken. Despite her age, Rivers was a busy comedian. She had been scheduled to tape new episodes of the E! show ""Fashion Police"" with her daughter in New York this week, but the tapings have been canceled, a network spokeswoman said. She performed her comedy act at New York's Laurie Beechman Theatre last Wednesday night and was booked to perform at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, on Friday. Michael Lucas, who was in the audience for Rivers' last show Wednesday night, told CNN that she joked about death. ""She said, 'You know I'm 81 years old, and I could drop dead at any moment and you would be so lucky because you will have a story to tell your friends for the rest of your life,' "" Lucas said. ""Then she mimicked people talking about what it was like to see her drop dead on stage."" Joan Rivers 'stands behind' Gaza quotes .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- MySpace galvanizes protestors to attend mass demonstrations; 1.8 million Britons sign an online petition, leading to widespread press coverage and government embarrassment; and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are fighting it out for the Democratic nomination on Facebook. Barack Obama's online support is way ahead of his rivals', including Hillary Clinton's . The Internet is now the focus for campaigners, marketers and activists, each claiming a slice of the virtual pie. We look at the impact of social networking sites on contemporary politics and ask, is the Web the new battleground? Sites like MySpace, Bebo and Facebook give people a tool to interact online and extend their social lives beyond working hours. But what's interesting campaign managers is that they've been seized with such enthusiasm by increasingly hard-to-target teens and young adults -- even Britain's Prince Harry is rumored to have a Facebook account. This marks a crucial development in the Internet's history: Far from being a place where geeks go to hang out with other geeks, the Internet is now as vital a part of the average college student's world as Spring Break. No longer a virtual refuge for lonely nerds, these sites are used daily by bright young things, keen to arrange the latest hot club/bar/gig to visit. And politicians have wised up to this. Howard Dean set the ball rolling in 2004, raising around $50 million in his Presidential nomination campaign by using the Internet to garner large numbers of small-scale donations and pump up his coffers. John Kerry followed suit in his 2004 Presidential campaign against George W. Bush, famously narrowing the funding gap with his Republican rival . But this time round, candidates are plugging in and getting personal. Mitt Romney was the first potential Republican Presidential candidate to launch a Facebook profile; Democrat John Edwards was the first to set up shop in virtual world Second Life; and Hillary Clinton launched her Presidential campaign via her Web site. All of the major candidates for the 2008 American Presidential election have support on Facebook and profiles on MySpace. Right now, these sites are being harnessed most successfully by the Democrats, and notably Barack Obama's campaign. At the time of writing, his supporters include over 161,000 friends on MySpace against Clinton's 42,000-odd and John Edwards's 28,000. (Republican John McCain has 21,000; Mitt Romney trails him on 12,000.) Obama's biggest Facebook supporters' group, ""One Million Strong for Barack Obama"" had over 320,000 members (as opposed to Hillary Clinton's ""One Million Strong for Hillary Clinton,"" with 5,300); and a growing pool of photographs on Flickr, the photo-hosting online community. What Obama's team seems to understand -- and others grasp with varying degrees of success -- is that it's not just about broadcasting to a hard-to-reach demographic. In order to recruit voters online, candidates must appear to engage with potential supporters on a far more personal level, on their terms, in their environment. These sites tear down the traditional barriers between those in power -- be they celebrities or politicians -- and their fanbase or supporters, providing the semblance -- if not the reality -- of personal involvement and a forum for discussion. If a 22-year-old male from New Hampshire can be ""friends"" on MySpace with Paris Hilton, goes the thinking, why not Senator Obama? But only time will tell if the winner of this online popularity contest can convert his virtual ""friends"" into concrete votes. Away from the presidential campaigns, social networking sites also make it easy for activists to cross political boundaries. Net users don't have to buy into a suite of policies; using the web, pressure groups can focus their efforts on single issues instead. News on the virtual street travels quickly across existing networks of friends -- whether it's via email, blogs or messageboards. In 2006, MySpace users spread the word about immigration rights demonstrations across the United States. The Associated Press reported that half a million people turned out to the Los Angeles rally, while a Time poll indicated that two out of three Americans heard about the protests. Of course, the large numbers who attended the protests didn't all read about it on MySpace. But the site did enable grassroots information sharing between large numbers of people who were otherwise hard to reach, keeping them informed and encouraging them to action. It's not just the social networking sites that are drawing campaigners' attention. While Flash mobs -- sudden, unexpected and short-lived gatherings of members of the public, organized by Web sites and text messages -- usually tend towards the surreal (zombie mobs in Toronto, pillow fights in Buenos Aires) they have also been utilized by pressure groups. A flash mob gathered at an Oxfam thrift store in Birmingham, England in 2003, sang ""Give it Away"" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, stripped off and donated their clothes to the charity, in what the organizers claimed was the world's first altruistic mob, while in 2004, protestors in Bucharest, Romania, criticized limits to freedom of speech by sealing their mouths with duct tape. Flickr, the social photo hosting site, has also been utilized. Nearly 4,000 members have added their support to the ONE campaign to make poverty history by posting their photo to the campaign's pool of photos, while Oxfam Australia publicize their campaigning by tagging their photos and encouraging others to do the same. Also on Flickr, ""Green My Apple"" is a Greenpeace-led pressure group of Mac devotees who want Apple to make more environmentally-friendly computers. They post photos of themselves with their Macs to a Flickr photo pool. Quite literally, it's a way of giving faces to the people behind the campaigns. It's not all plain sailing. The Internet has its own style of writing and its own social mores. A lack of experience at navigating the virtual realm can be painfully apparent. Politicians need to be careful about how they engage with their Internet audience. Savvy net-heads have little time for stuffed-shirt proselytizing, whether it's on MySpace or YouTube; having a Facebook profile doesn't automatically make you cool. And engaging with people online can backfire: the British Government, who set up a Web site where the public could create petitions, were sorely embarrassed when 1.8 million people called for planned pay-as-you-drive road charges to be scrapped. The unexpected weight of public opposition to the policy ensured a barrage of rather unwelcome media attention. Online presences are also susceptible to virtual attack. Back at Facebook, the only group coming close to Obama's support is the ""One Million Against Hillary Clinton"" with over 230,000 members. John Edwards' Second Life headquarters were vandalized by opponents; and a 1984-style pro-Obama video attacking Hillary Clinton and urging Americans to ""Vote Different"" had garnered over three million views on YouTube at the time of writing. Both attacks were veiled by the anonymity which the Internet provides, and politicians must now be wondering how much dirtier online campaigns will get -- and to what extent they'll escape from Campaign Headquarters' control. And that's where the real power in the Internet lies. Far from being a one-way broadcast, the medium allows people to engage with each other, get involved and focus on the issues they care about most. Most of all, it allows people to take a campaign and evolve it themselves. While this will terrify traditional campaign managers and PRs, who can see quality assurance flying out of the window along with their approved, on-message briefing sheets, is it really a bad thing that the Internet gives regular Joes the chance to broadcast alongside the big guns -- and the potential to beat them at their own game? ...................................................

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal agents found much of the information produced by the Bush administration's top-secret warrantless surveillance program vague and difficult to use, a sweeping review of the program found. Former President Bush claims his administration's surveillance program helped to ward off terrorist attacks. Then-President George Bush and other top administration officials have said the program was a critical tool in preventing terrorist attacks. However, a report Friday by the inspectors general of the CIA, the Justice Department, the Pentagon and other agencies found that some FBI and CIA agents were frustrated by the secrecy surrounding the program. Former CIA chiefs Michael Hayden and Porter Goss told investigators the wiretaps filled a gap in U.S. intelligence. One senior official quoted in the report called the wiretaps, dubbed the ""President's Surveillance Program"" by the report, ""a key resource,"" while the FBI considered it ""one tool of many"" in their efforts to head off terrorist plots, the report states. ""Even though most PSP leads were determined not to have any connection to terrorism, many of the FBI witnesses believed the mere possibility of the leads producing useful information made investigating the leads worthwhile,"" the report states. The program was hugely controversial when Bush acknowledged its existence in 2005. Critics said the program violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a 1978 law passed to rein in the wiretapping abuses of the Watergate era. Bush's approval allowed the National Security Agency to intercept communications between people in the United States and overseas who were suspected of having ties to terrorists without getting a court order. He and other officials said the program ""prevented attacks and saved lives,"" as Vice President Dick Cheney put it in a May speech critical of their successors in the Obama administration. But Friday's report found that the intelligence gathered was only a small part of counterterrorism work, and most intelligence officials interviewed for the report had trouble ""citing specific instances where PSP reporting had directly contributed to counterterrorism successes."" In addition, the CIA ""did not implement procedures to assess the usefulness of the product of the PSP, and did not routinely document whether particular PSP reporting had contributed to successful counterterrorism operations,"" the report states. At another point, it noted that some FBI agents ""criticized the PSP-derived information they received for providing insufficient details, and the agents who managed counterterrorism programs at the FBI field offices the DOJ IG visited said the FBI's process for disseminating PSP-derived information failed to adequately prioritize the information for investigation. Meanwhile, CIA officers were unable to make ""full use"" of the data because too few people had been briefed on the closely held program. ""According to one CIA manager, the tight control over access to the PSP prevented some officers who could have made effective use of the program reporting from being read in,"" the report states. The report also confirmed that the PSP was not limited to the electronic intercepts, referring repeatedly to ""other intelligence activities"" that remain classified. The report concluded the program was built on a ""factually flawed"" legal analysis inappropriately provided by a single Justice Department official, John Yoo, in 2001. Yoo did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment, and he was not interviewed for the report. A 2004 review by the Justice Department triggered a dramatic confrontation in 2004 between White House and Justice officials who concluded the program would not pass legal muster. Former Deputy Attorney General James Comey, who took part in that face-off, told investigators that the program's original authorization ""involved ignoring an act of Congress, and doing so without full congressional notification."" That line drew the ire of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who issued a statement Friday declaring that ""no president should be able to operate outside the law."" ""The House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees will closely examine the findings and recommendations of the classified and unclassified reports, and will conduct appropriate oversight of electronic surveillance activities,"" the California Democrat said. Sen. Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the report ""highlights just how outrageous and damaging the illegal warrantless wiretapping program really was."" ""This report leaves no doubt that the warrantless wiretapping program was blatantly illegal and an unconstitutional assertion of executive power,"" Feingold said. ""I once again call on the Obama administration and its Justice Department to withdraw the flawed legal memoranda that justified the program and that remain in effect today.""","Audit: Info from Bush's surveillance program found to be vague .

"Boston, MA (CNN) -- Sometimes, implementing wide-reaching social change takes surprisingly few materials. With just a handful of bike gears, MIT professor Amos Winter is hoping to change the developing world forever. Winter is the inventor of the Leveraged Freedom Chair (LFC). It is a low-cost wheelchair powered by two hand levers that function in a similar manner to gears on a bike. The higher you grab it, the more leverage you get when traversing over rough terrain like sand, mud, or unpaved road. Grab down lower, and the machine can cruise along tarmac at five miles-an-hour. It is one of the most versatile wheelchairs on the market, and for the time being, it is aimed solely for disabled communities in the developing world. ""If you are a wheelchair user who lives in a rural area, there's not really a good mobility aid that allows you to travel a long distance on many types of terrains, but is also small and maneuverable to use indoors. ""That is kind of what set the stage for creating the LFC,"" says Winter, who forms part of the R&D team at GRIT, the socially enterprising design collective that brought the wheelchair to market. It may seem like a simple premise, but the LFC has the potential to empower a community that, in poorer countries, can often feel disenfranchised. ""As this technology has grown and become a product, it's been very fulfilling to see that not only can people ride off-road, but having that capability also lets them have a job, or go to school or fully participate in their community,"" says Winter. What makes the LFC a truly invaluable tool in low income communities is its sheer value for money. Traditionally, wheelchairs with the capability to go off-road clock in somewhere between $4,500 and $6,500, making them prohibitive to the rural communities that need them the most. The LFC, by comparison, costs $200. The low price point, explains Winter, makes it a sexier sell to the non-profit organizations responsible for delivering these units to emerging markets. ""It had to be cheap enough to fit within the current provision and donation structures that already distribute wheelchairs,"" he says. Furthermore, Winter recognized that to be of use to the developing world, it had to be built from parts that were easily accessible. ""The chair not only had to be repairable, but we wanted it robust,"" he says. ""We wanted it to have minimal parts that could break in the field, but if the parts do need servicing, they're made from bike parts and they're easily available."" Winter's inspiration for the LFC came about in 2005, when he spent a summer in Tanzania assessing wheelchair technology for a group of wheelchair organizations. He later started developing the technology as a graduate student at MIT. ""When we started the project, we were a team of gung-ho students who had this cool idea for the lever system. We made some prototypes and were excited about them and brought them abroad and people were like, 'these are terrible. What were you thinking? You have no frame of reference of what it's actually like to use a wheelchair everyday,'"" he recalls. Over the next few years, he consulted continuously with wheelchair users, and went through several stages of trial and error before landing on the current model. Winter is currently working with design consultancy firm Continuum on a version of the LFC for the first-world. In all likelihood, it will have more features than the original. ""In the developed world, because there is more disposable income, it's possible to add additional functionality, things that simply are nice to have but not essential to have,"" notes Gianfranco Zaccai, Continuum's president. The more advanced (and likely more expensive) model, though, ""can help support the developing world wheelchair,"" he adds. For Winter, however, the greatest implication of his invention is the platform it has given him to enact even more, farther-reaching change. In a few years, Winter has gone from MIT graduate to assistant professor of mechanical engineering, and director of the University's Global Engineering and Research (GEAR) Lab, an enterprise that couples engineering and product design to solve real-world problems. In addition to the LFC, he has delved into how to deliver low-cost prosthetics to poor countries, eco-efficient irrigation systems that enable small-scale farmers to get a higher crop yield and projects related to water purification.

""I love engineering, I love innovation, and I love being able to work on problems that nobody else has solved before.""","An MIT professor has developed an affordable all-terrain wheelchair for developing countries.

"Washington (CNN) -- The sure-to-be politically fraught nomination process for Eric Holder's replacement as attorney general will come after next month's midterm elections, the White House said on Tuesday. An official, speaking anonymously about the nomination process, said Senate Democrats urged the White House to wait until after November's contests to put a nominee forward to head the Justice Department. Democrats are urgently working to maintain control of the Senate, and are expected to lose seats in the Republican-controlled House. Holder, the last of President Barack Obama's original cabinet members, was a politically divisive attorney general, and the fight to replace him is expected to be rancorous on Capitol Hill. A nominee could be pushed through a lame duck session after the midterm elections, though other issues on the congressional docket -- like authorizing Obama's use of force in against ISIS -- are expected to dominate proceedings in November and December. ""I do anticipate that Democrats will hold the Senate,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters after Holder resigned. ""That said, I also anticipate that whoever the nominee is will earn and ultimately receive bipartisan support."" Democrats close to the nominating process have floated several names as potential Holder replacements: the current Labor Secretary Tom Perez, the former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, and former White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler are all considered in the mix. Others include U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and former Justice Department official Tony West.

"(CNN) -- Newman, Jerry Seinfeld's diabolical nemesis and United States postal worker, was denied his dream transfer to Hawaii when the Post Office discovered he hadn't been delivering a lot of the mail he was supposed to be. Unfortunately for Brent Morse, life isn't a Hollywood sitcom. The former Kentucky postal worker was sentenced to six months in federal prison for ""destroying, hiding and delaying the delivery of at least 44,900 pieces of mail,"" according to David J. Hale, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Kentucky. Morse, a mail carrier for five years, stored the nearly 45,000 pieces of undelivered mail at his deceased mother's home and, just like Newman, at rented storage facilities near his home and mail route in western Kentucky. The majority of the mail was meant for around 250 homes in the community of Dawson Springs, and it was meant to be delivered between March 2011 and March 2013, Hale said. Adel Valdes, a U.S. Postal Inspector in Louisville, said Morse's motive was: ""He wanted to pick up his kids from school every day at a certain time."" Valdes said the owner of one of the storage centers noticed a large amount of mail and USPS equipment when Morse failed to properly shut his unit's door, so he called authorities. Morse, 34, was not charged with stealing the contents of the undelivered mail, according to Hale, but he was ordered to pay nearly $15,000 in restitution for losses incurred by two businesses that mail commercial circulars. The USPS has since delivered the recovered mail.","Worker Brent Morse guilty of ""destroying, hiding and delaying"" mail .

"(CNN) -- The lack of phone calls, texts or social media postings from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has raised a number of questions about how cell phones work on airplanes. A U.S. official told CNN a cell tower in Penang, Malaysia, detected the co-pilot's cell phone searching for service before the flight vanished. Here's a quick primer on how and when phones can make a connection from the air: . How high in the air can a cell phone work? Despite the urgings of flight crews to turn off all phones or put them in airplane mode, cell phones can continue to work after a plane takes off, but only while in range of a cellular tower. Cell phones communicate through cell towers, which are located on the ground but can stretch hundreds of feet into the air. As an airplane rises, it gets further from these towers and eventually moves out of contact range. For efficiency, many towers are designed to direct their signal where its most useful: on the ground, not into the sky above. The maximum distance at which a phone can still make calls and send texts varies depending on the type of tower and transmitter, but an airplane would have to be no more than 10,000 feet in the air for any cell phones on board to still have a signal, according to Bill Rojas, director of telecom research at IDC Asia Pacific. It's not just altitude that can limit cell phone service. When flying over sparsely populated rural areas, nearby towers are fewer and farther between. Over the open ocean, there are no towers at all with which to communicate, making phone calls, texts and social media posts impossible. Speed can also make maintaining a cellular connection difficult, as a device has to switch from tower to tower to maintain a connection. Rojas told CNN that a plane would have to be going 155 miles per hour (250 kilometers per hour) or less for phones in cell-tower range to make or receive calls. The metal body of an airplane can also impede cellular service. What is airplane mode? Airplane mode is a setting on smartphones and tablets that turns off most or all of a device's wireless communication features. This includes shutting down cellular connections, Wi-Fi, GPS and Bluetooth so that no calls, messages or data can be sent or received. This setting has different names depending on the device and operating system, but is present on all smartphones. Can a phone in airplane mode still communicate? It is not possible to send or receive communications while in full airplane mode. On some phones, it is possible to turn Wi-Fi back on while in airplane mode to take advantage of any on-board wireless networks, or to reactivate Bluetooth to hook up to any compatible devices. Neither setting would communicate with a cell tower on the ground, though. Are all phones on flights in airplane mode? Up to 30% of all passengers reported forgetting to power down their devices when asked on airplanes, according a survey conducted last year by the Consumer Electronics Association. It's likely that many passengers also forget to turn their phone to Airplane Mode when taking off and that all flights have a few cellular devices that can still search for towers. Do phones communicate with towers when not in use? A cell phone not set to airplane mode could still automatically connect to cellular base stations when in the proper range. Background phone tasks such as location services, e-mail and other things that push through notifications are always attempting to connect and send and receive information. Any attempted connections or pings would be recorded by mobile operators. Don't many airlines offer inflight Wi-Fi? Some airplanes offer inflight wireless connections that can be used to connect to the Internet and make calls and send texts using services such as Skype and WhatsApp. There are different technologies for bringing Wi-Fi to airplanes. Some use special mobile broadband cell towers on the ground that are flipped to point into the air. Satellite technology can be used to get signals where there are no ground towers. If the inflight entertainment system is turned off, phones and other devices cannot use these wireless connections. Aren't some flights going to allow calls in the air? Recently, the FAA loosened its rules for using cellular devices on airplanes. Many airlines now allow you to use tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing as long as they are in airplane mode. It is also considering allowing cell phone calls in the air. To make that possible, airplanes would need to be equipped with specialized miniature base stations called picocells. Those base stations would relay any cellular signals through satellites or cell towers on the ground that are already set up to work with airplanes.","New reports claim cell towers recorded the phone of the co-pilot of MH 370 .

"(CNN) -- Judge William Adams, who made national headlines after the release of a 2004 video of him beating his then-teenage daughter, has been suspended by the Texas Supreme Court. Adams, while not admitting guilt or wrongdoing, agreed to the suspension. He will be paid during the suspension. The judge's lawyer, William Dudley, said his client proposed the suspension motion with input from the state Commission on Judicial Conduct, which is investigating the incident. Adams already was on voluntary leave, Dudley said in a statement to CNN. In a separate ruling, a Texas judge ruled Wednesday that Adams can have supervised visitation with his younger daughter, 10. Adams, a court-at-law judge in Aransas County, was roundly criticized when his now-adult daughter posted online a video of him beating her with a belt when she was 16. The video also showed the judge cursing and berating Hillary Adams. William Adams was punishing the girl for using the Internet ""to acquire music and games that were unavailable for legal purchase at the time,"" Hillary Adams wrote on the web posting. The video is punctuated by cracks of the man's belt and the girl's screams and cries. At one point in the 7 1/2-minute video, the man says to his near-hysterical daughter, ""What happened to you, Hillary? Once you were an obedient, nice little girl. Now you lie, cheat and steal."" He yells at her, ""You want to put some more computer games on? You want some more?"" ""Are you happy?"" he asks her. ""Disobeying your parents? You don't deserve to f---ing be in this house."" He also berates the girl's mother for allowing a ""f---ing computer"" in the house. ""I wanted to show my father, 'Hey, I think you were in some denial about the way you are treating me and my mother.' And maybe showing him this would make him see something he didn't before,"" Hillary Adams, now 23, told CNN. Earlier this month, William Adams released a statement to explain his side of the story. ""If the public must know, just prior to the YouTube upload, a concerned father shared with his 23-year-old daughter that he was unwilling to continue to work hard and be her primary source of financial support, if she was going to simply 'drop out,' and strive to achieve no more in life than to work part-time at a video game store,"" the judge said in a statement. Adams handles family-related and juvenile court issues for the county court system. Meanwhile, a judge ruled Wednesday that Adams can have supervised visitation with his 10-year-old daughter. ""Respondent is enjoined from causing bodily injury to the child or threatening the child with bodily injury,"" District Judge Kemper Stephen Williams ordered. ""The parties are ... ordered to conduct themselves at all times in a manner that will minimize the exposure of the child to harmful parental conflict,"" according to a copy of the order provided by attorney Brett Pritchard, who represents the judge's former wife, Hallie Adams. Dudley said both parents, who have joint custody, have been ordered to attend a parenting class. They divorced in 2007. ""Judge Adams is certain that Judge Williams' ruling reflects the trial court's paramount duty to protect this child's best interests,"" Dudley said in a statement. ""Judge Adams will take all appropriate steps to abide by the court's temporary ruling."" Hallie Adams had unilaterally tried to keep his client away from the girl, Dudley said. A temporary restraining order issued earlier this month enjoined Adams from visiting his younger daughter, Pritchard said. Earlier this month, Hallie Adams told CNN's Anderson Cooper about what she called a dysfunctional home where violence was a regular occurrence. The mother participated in the videotaped beating, but has since apologized. She said her former husband told her to help administer the punishment. ""She's ashamed she allowed that to happen,"" Pritchard told CNN Wednesday. ""She's elated her 10-year-old will be able to visit with her dad but not be subjected to emotional and verbal abuse.""","Judge can have supervised visitation with younger daughter .

"(CNN)  -- A U.N.-backed military operation to thwart rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo has led to deliberate killings of more than 1,400 civilians in the country over a nine-month period, Human Rights Watch said Monday. The human rights organization's report accuses militants and Congolese soldiers of brutal attacks, and urges the United Nations to end support for the military operation and find other ways to establish security. Attacks include chopping civilians to death with machetes and slitting the throats of others. The attacks occurred between January and September, according to the report. Human Rights Watch said it based its findings on interviews with more than 600 victims, witnesses and relatives. More than 7,500 women and girls were sexually abused in eastern Congo during the same period, Human Rights Watch said. ""Continued killing and rape by all sides in eastern Congo shows that the U.N. Security Council needs a new approach to protect civilians,"" said Anneke Van Woudenberg, senior researcher at the organization. ""The security council should send a group of experts to Congo to kickstart a serious civilian protection plan."" Congolese forces have been battling Rwandan Hutu rebels who fled to Congo after participating in a Rwandan genocide that left at least 800,000 people dead. A U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as MONUC, backs the operation. The United Nations has said that overall, the mission is working to boost stability and protect civilians. However, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hinted at high death tolls last week, saying that the military operations have come at a ""high humanitarian cost."" The Congolese armed forces and the rebels have violated human rights, Ban said. The peacekeeping mission has urged the government to address the problem, he added. Human Rights Watch said the operations to oust rebels have not met expectations, and civilian casualties greatly outnumber the damage to rebels. ""Government representatives said the operations would bring peace and security to the region. They have not,"" the New York-based agency said. War-torn Congo is rich in natural resources, including diamonds, gold and coltan, but most of its population lives in poverty because of the conflict. The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to vote soon on whether to renew the peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.","Congo is rich in natural resources but most people live in poverty due to the conflict .

"(CNN) -- Think that President Barack Obama has done a back flip on Iraq and Syria, gotten that old-time religion and is now a convert to the ""let's kill them wherever we find them"" approach of his predecessors? Think again, or at least lay down until the feeling passes. Indeed, stripped to its essence, what the President has outlined isn't some grand strategy to transform the region or even to ""ultimately destroy"" ISIS; it's a much narrower transactional one to protect the homeland. And here's why: . The speech the President gave is quite consistent with who he is and what his priorities have been all along, particularly relating to counterterrorism. Sure he's now morphed from a desire to avoid militarizing the U.S. role in Syria to a new willingness to do so. But the reason he's traveled down that road is critical. It's not some ideological crusade, fascination with nation-building or democratization of a new Middle East. ISIS now poses a threat to the homeland, a contingency that could not only directly threaten Americans but destroy his presidency as well. And the one area where Obama has been prepared to be ready to take on risk is in counterterrorism. Anti-terrorist in chief . Indeed, it's hardly a secret and it is a disappointment to many of his own supporters that this President long ago morphed into a much more disciplined and risk-ready anti-terrorist than his predecessor. He doubled down in Afghanistan; used drones 10 times more than President George W. Bush (431 targeted killings); authorized the mission that killed Osama bin Laden; dismantled much of al Qaeda central; and has been involved in a giant game of Whack-a-Mole these past six years against bad guys from Pakistan to Yemen and Somalia. ISIS might not be a threat to the homeland now. According to the State Department's Annual Report on Terrorism for 2013, there were 17,891 global fatalities because of terror; only 16 Americans were among them. But who knows how ISIS might direct its efforts in the future? It's richer, smarter and more capable than al Qaeda in many respects. And there's quite a bit of time left on Obama's presidential clock. He simply cannot afford to play loose on this issue. Indeed he must be perceived and in fact deliver on doing everything he possibly can to preempt and prevent ISIS from striking here or in the region against Americans. He wasn't 20 seconds intro his speech before he said the following: ""As commander in chief, my highest priority is the security of the American people."" And the polls demonstrate pretty conclusively that ISIS is on America's radar screen and people see it as a real threat. Grand strategy? Not really . We'd love to believe that all parts of the strategy the President laid out Wednesday night can work seamlessly in pursuit of that ultimate presidential responsibility. But it's hard to imagine they will. Securing an end state in Iraq and Syria that will somehow lead to good governance and reduce the grievances on which ISIS feeds seems a real stretch. It won't happen quickly, easily or probably at all, certainly not without Syrians and Iraqis taking real ownership. And getting a bunch of constrained Sunni Arab allies on board who seem at odds with one another -- namely Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE on the one hand and Qatar and Turkey on the other -- also seems very unlikely. Certainly plans to get Arabs on the ground to actually fight against ISIS -- now bandied about by some very smart people -- are also a bridge too far. Providing bases and money to train Syrians to fight, sure; sharing intelligence, absolutely. But we need to keep our expectations very low. Any kind of Sunni Arab state coalition of the willing actually willing to enter the fight against ISIS on the ground seems like a fanciful scene out of a bad Hollywood movie. The only way the Arab states are willing to fight ISIS? To the last American. Is the enemy of my enemy my friend? Iran is another problematic piece of the puzzle -- and was not mentioned at all in the President's speech. The administration has a short-term coincidence of interest with Iran against ISIS. We've seen this movie before in the first Gulf War in the early 1990s when Iran condemned Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and in Afghanistan in 2001, when elements of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were on the ground training and fighting alongside U.S. Special Operations forces to bolster the Northern Alliance. But the emphasis should be the on short term. Tehran has a different vision for Iraq and Syria than we do. Consider the machinations in Baghdad over the past decade by Qassem Suleimani, head of the Qods Force. So any notion that the enemy of my enemy is my friend just doesn't add up in this case. Iran isn't America's friend. Whether the administration can fashion an effective fighting force out of scores of Syrian militias is a very arguable proposition. Let's road test it. But it will take time. In the interim, we will have enough difficulty operating against ISIS on our own without good intelligence and special forces on the ground, and getting at ISIS in the midst of a civil war. In the end, whether this approach works or not, the essence of the President's policy will end up being driven by U.S. air power: Destroy ISIS from the air, certainly as they move across the border into Iraq and then as the intel improves, attack them in Syria, too, and empower our new allies to do so on the ground. After more than a decade of the war on terror against al Qaeda, if you asked us what the most immediate threat to the continental United States is, we wouldn't say ISIS. We'd say al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula with its demonstrated capacity to make bombs and to try to attack America. Our point isn't to deny the success of counterterrorism efforts; it's to suggest that hitting one jihadist group usually means that affiliates and derivatives emerge. And that's likely to happen even with great success against ISIS. This really is the long war. Fighting these people is like breathing. You just can't stop. We think the President gets all this. And frankly, there really isn't much more he could have said or in fact much more he could be doing. In the end, this is not about grand plans, designs and hopes to transform the Middle East -- one broken, angry and dysfunctional region of the world. For America, it's about how to continue our track record: no al Qaeda-directed attacks on U.S. soil in 13 years. You can dress it up all you want with allies, coalitions, political reforms and inclusiveness. But Obama knows that in the end when stripped to its essence, it's about killing bad guys before they have a chance to kill us.","Has President Obama reverted to George W. Bush's policy on terrorism and the Middle East?

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Aspiring Hong Kong musician Annabelle Cheng wants to be in America. ""I think (Hong Kong) is a city that can be defined by business,"" said Cheng, who recently graduated from Baptist University in Hong Kong with a degree in religion and philosophy. ""But the cost of living in a dynamic city is that you don't have your personal space."" Asian population booming throughout U.S. Living conditions in this crowded and hectic enclave are part of the reason Cheng wants to relocate to the U.S. ""I really need that amount of time and space to think, to meditate, to get inspiration,"" said Cheng, who plans to save and apply for a post-graduate music program in the U.S. in two years. Cheng isn't alone. Despite the rising fortunes of Asia, the Pew Center released a report last month that shows Asians have surpassed Latinos as the largest group of immigrants to the United States. And university is often a gateway to residency: around half of Asian immigrants have a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to 13% of Hispanics, according to the report. ""There have been many thousands upon thousands of Chinese students attracted to the U.S. for studies,"" said Yeung Yue-Man, Emeritus Professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who specializes in development patterns. ""This trend has been gathering pace for the last two decades since the Chinese have become better off than before, they have the means and they can afford the high tuition."" China leads overseas applications to American university graduate programs, followed by India and South Korea, according to a report by the Council of Graduate Schools. Sean Luo first came to the U.S. in 2000 as a graduate student after working for a Chinese state-run telecommunications company. After earning his degree, he decided to stay. He attained permanent residency in 2006 and now runs his own telecommunications company in Los Angeles. ""No matter who you are, chances (in the United States) are equal for everyone,"" said Luo, adding that as a first-generation American, there have been difficult adjustments. ""For cultural reasons, it's not easy to get into the mainstream social circle."" Although he occasionally thinks of returning to China, the growing cost of living and uncertain political climate keep him in the U.S. ""Asian countries are the most populous, has more competition and less resources,"" Luo said. ""We are just being rational to immigrate to the countries where there are less people and more resources."" Adopted from China: Finding identity through heritage . One entrepreneur who moved his family to Los Angeles said that he moved to give his children better educational opportunities. ""China is not the best place to raise kids,"" said the 40-year-old man, who wants to remain anonymous so as not to jeopardize his business and family in China. As for himself, he left China feeling insecure in a society where government has the final say in everything. ""Individuals should be protected by laws and everyone's commitment to obey laws,"" the entrepreneur said. ""Everyone minds their own business here. Very few people like to judge others."" It's a common reason for China's wealthy class to emigrate, he said. About half the Chinese millionaires polled last year said they are thinking of emigrating, with North America the top destination, according to a November Hurun Research Institute and Bank of China report. Another source of Chinese immigrants is investment. ""In real estate, the recent Chinese [immigrants] are quite well off, they want to find places where they can park their investment,"" Yeung said. ""U.S. cities have become quite attractive to Chinese investors to buy property,"" Yeung said. Cheng, the Hong Kong musician, says she has a lot of American friends coming to Hong Kong to look for opportunities. ""At the moment, the economy in the U.S. is quite bad, compared to Hong Kong,"" Cheng said, ""so I'm going to wait ... I think in two years the economy will boom again."" Still, Cheng believes her prospects are greater across the Pacific. ""This is more possible in the U.S. than in Hong Kong,"" Cheng said. Three Asian-American families share a slice of life .

"New York (CNN) -- Brooklyn Nets. This is what the NBA world will now be calling the New Jersey Nets. Media mogul Shawn ""Jay-Z"" Carter revealed the name Monday, along with Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, Forest City Ratner Companies Chairman and CEO Bruce Ratner, and Barclays Center and Nets CEO Brett Yormark, at Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn. They were near the construction site of the Nets' future home, The Barclays Center. ""We are proud to announce this highly anticipated decision to name the team the Brooklyn Nets, a choice which reflects the decades-long tradition of our team and fans, as well as the dynamic new place that will be our home,"" Nets Chairman Chris Charlier said. Carter, a part owner of the Nets, also said he will be the first to perform at the venue's opening, scheduled for September 2012. ""From the moment the Barclays Center became a reality, I knew this meant something significant for Brooklyn,"" Carter said. ""This is where I'm from, I'll always be Brooklyn, and opening this arena will mean more to me than anywhere else,"" he said. ""We're going to create an atmosphere like only Brooklyn can."" The Barclays Center is set to host major entertainment and sporting events, which could mean some competition for New York's staple Madison Square Garden. It will also feature four bars, three clubs and a restaurant. Carter invited 25 students from George Westinghouse High School, where he attended, to take part in the announcement, which included the unveiling of a marketing campaign for fall's All Access Pass featuring Carter. Marketing includes 250,000 coffee cups, 150 taxi tops, print ads, pay phones, direct mail and a billboard across the street from the venue.","Shawn ""Jay-Z"" Carter, a part owner, reveals new name .

"(CNN) -- An Australian judge ruled Tuesday that the band Men at Work must pay 5 percent of royalities from their 1980s hit ""Down Under"" for plagiarizing a popular nursery rhyme about a Kookaburra written in 1932. In February, Federal Court judge Peter Jacobsen found that the flute riff in ""Down Under"" did mimic the Kookaburra song. ""I would emphasise that the findings I have made do not amount to a finding that the flute riff is a substantial part of Down Under or that it is the 'hook' of that song,"" he said at the time. ""Down Under"" was composed and performed by Men at Work founding member Colin Hay in 1978. Greg Ham added the flute riff after he joined the band in mid-1979. According to court documents, Ham added the riff to the song to inject some ""Australian flavor."" He admitted he had heard the song while growing up in the country in the late 1950s and was ""pretty sure"" that Kookaburra was in his school's song book. The song was written in 1932 by teacher Marion Sinclair, and Australian music group Larrikin Publishing bought the copyright to it in 1990 after Sinclair's death in 1988. It wasn't until a quiz show in 2007 that Larrikin Managing Director Norman Lurie became aware of the songs' similarities and the potential for a law suit. Jacobsen found that Ham deliberately included the bars from Kookaburra into the flute line, but accepted that Colin Hay didn't realize it was from the nursery rhyme until early in the last decade. Larrikin had sought 40 to 60 percent of the royalties earned by ""Down Under"" in Australia since May 20, 2002, the limit imposed under Australian law. The ruling says it would make sense for the ruling to apply to future royalty payments. ""I consider the figures put forward by Larrikin to be excessive, overreaching and unrealistic,"" Jacobsen said in Tuesday's ruling. ""It's just really a pity that Marion Sinclair, the lady who wrote it, didn't participate in income from the song when the song was at its height in the early 80s,"" Larrikin's lawyer Adam Simpson said in February. At the time, Simpson said the company did not plan to sue overseas for royalties earned by the song outside Australia. ""To be honest, such things are theoretically possible but we're keeping it simple,"" he said. Experts say the amount of damages payable will be limited by the judge's finding that riff did not amount to the ""hook"" of the song. ""There's a lot more to 'Down Under' than that flute melody. It's not the main melody and not the main hook and I suppose that in the end will mean that it will be a minor share of the royalties that this publisher can claim now,"" said Daniel Mullensiefen, co-director of the masters program in Music, Mind and Brain at Goldsmiths University in London. The shorter, more popular version of ""Down Under"" was released in 1981 in Australia on the band's hugely successful ""Business as Usual"" album. By January 1983, the single had topped the music charts in Australia, the U.S., Britain, Canada and several European countries.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Nicolas Cage brought about his own financial ruin with a spending spree that included two castles, 15 palatial homes, a flotilla of yachts and a squadron of Rolls Royces, his former business manager said. Samuel Levin, responding to a lawsuit Cage filed against him, said he warned the Oscar-winning actor that he could face bankruptcy unless he scaled back his lavish lifestyle. Cage, one of Hollywood's highest-paid movie stars, sued Levin in October, charging that he ""lined his pockets with several million dollars in business management fees while sending Cage down a path toward financial ruin."" ""Cage discovered that he is now forced to sell major assets and investments at a significant loss and is faced with huge tax liabilities because of Levin's incompetence, misrepresentations and recklessness,"" Cage's lawsuit said. He asked the Los Angeles Superior Court for $20 million in damages from Levin. Levin filed a counter-complaint this week demanding $129,000 owed to him by Cage for recent work on his tax returns. The filing also argued that Cage was ""deeply in debt"" when he started working for him in 2001 because Cage had ""already squandered tens of millions of dollars he had earned as a movie star."" Levin said he warned Cage, whose given name is Nicolas Coppola, that he needed to earn $30 million a year ""just to maintain his lavish lifestyle."" He urged Cage to save ""a cash cushion"" of at least $10 million ""to alleviate the financial pressure to take film roles that might be detrimental to his career,"" Levin's response said. Several of Cage's recent movie roles have been seen by critics as ""paycheck gigs"" taken only because of his pressing debt. Levin's filing claimed that starting in 2005 and then ""with increasing urgency"" over the next two years, he ""implored Coppola to stop buying real estate and urged him to reduce his real estate holdings, warning Coppola that the financial press was filled with references to a 'real estate bubble.' "" He countered Cage's claim that the actor was left in the dark about his finances. ""Levin repeatedly warned Coppola that he was living beyond his means, urged him to spend less, and warned him that financial disaster loomed if he continued to spend uncontrollably,"" Levin's filing said. ""Levin described the folly of several other well-known entertainers who compulsively overspent their way into bankruptcy, and warned Coppola 'it could happen to you,' "" the filing said. Cage should have known about his debt because ""he signed every check for every monetary transaction throughout the relationship,"" Levin said. ""Instead of listening to Levin, cross-defendant Coppola spent most of his free time shopping for high ticket purchases, and wound up with 15 personal residences, most of which were bought against Levin's advice,"" Levin's complaint said. ""Likewise, Levin advised Coppola against buying a Gulfstream jet, against buying and owning a flotilla of yachts, against buying and owning a squadron of Rolls Royces, against buying millions of dollars in jewelry and art."" Cage's four yachts included one each for the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, Newport Beach, California, and Rhode Island, Levin said. In 2007 alone, Cage's ""shopping spree entailed the purchase of three additional residences at a total cost of more than $33 million; the purchase of 22 automobiles (including 9 Rolls Royces); 12 purchases of expensive jewelry; and 47 purchases of artwork and exotic items,"" Levin's filing said. ""Coppola also spent huge sums taking his sizable entourage on costly vacations and threw enormous, Gatsby-style parties at his residences,"" it said. Levin's warnings that Cage was living beyond his means were not just ignored, but ""at times Levin was rebuked for trying to restrain the outflow of cash,"" he said. ""The pinnacle"" of Cage's spending spree was the purchase of two castles -- in England and Germany -- which Levin warned ""were decrepit and needed huge expenditures,"" he said. Cage's financial collapse came in 2008 when real estate values plunged and most of his residences turned ""upside down, just as the global credit crunch made it impossible to cover Coppola's endless cash calls by borrowing more money,"" Levin said. The case of Nicolas Cage versus Samuel Levin is set for a hearing in a Beverly Hills, California, courtroom on February 3, 2010, according to court records.","Samuel Levin responds to a lawsuit actor Nicolas Cage filed against him .

"(Health.com) -- Parents who are concerned about drinking and other risky behavior often try to steer their teenage children away from friends and dating partners whom they consider ""bad influences."" Those parents may want to look one step further: A new study suggests that teenagers with a new boyfriend or girlfriend tend to be more influenced by the drinking habits of their romantic partner's friends than they are by the partners themselves. Why? Dating introduces adolescents to new and different social networks and also creates a kind of indirect peer pressure, says lead researcher Derek Kreager, Ph.D., an associate professor of crime, law, and justice at Pennsylvania State University, in University Park. Health.com: Top 10 myths about safe sex and sexual health . A teen's longtime friends tend to be like-minded when it comes to values and lifestyle, but romantic partners are more likely to come from a different circle. ""Think of your son or daughter's new significant other as a bridge to a whole other group that he or she is now going to be exposed to,"" Kreager says. When teenagers begin dating, they tend to meet in the middle when it comes to habits like drinking. If a teen girl who has yet to experiment with alcohol starts dating a boy who drinks often, for instance, the boy is likely to cut back while the girl is likely to give drinking a try. ""He has an incentive to change, to be more like her,"" Kreager explains. ""On the other hand, his friends don't really have any reason to change, so they continue drinking. Meanwhile, she has incentive to be like those friends, because that's what appeals to her partner."" Health.com: Sneaky ways to just say no to alcohol . It's no surprise that social networks have a strong influence on personal health. Several studies from a research team based at Harvard University and the University of California, San Diego. have documented how family and friends can ""spread"" obesity, drinking, smoking, and even happiness. These social patterns may be even more important among teenagers, says Angela Diaz, M.D., program and research director of the adolescent health center at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, in New York. ""It's during adolescence that kids start exploring adult behavior and adult roles, and looking for acceptance and respect,"" she says. ""And throughout high school, a child's peer groups will change dramatically based on the new behaviors they pick up and the new people they encounter."" Health.com: Family, friends are big influence on drinking . In the study, which was published in the American Sociological Review, Kreager and his colleagues analyzed questionnaires from 898 students that were collected as part of a larger national survey on adolescent health. When the students were in seventh through twelfth grade, researchers interviewed the kids about drinking and binge drinking (among other health-related behaviors), and also asked them to name several of their close friends at school, many of whom were also study participants. In a follow-up interview two years later, the same students answered similar questions and were also asked to name special romantic partners from the past 18 months. By identifying pairs of students who became a couple and comparing their survey responses, the researchers were able to see how the teens' social networks and drinking habits changed over time. Health.com: Binge drinking may harm learning, memory . They found that younger teenagers tend to socialize with friends of the same gender, and that being involved in romantic relationships often introduces them to mixed-gender peer groups. And while friends and significant others both influenced the future drinking habits of the study participants, it was the second-degree friends of partners that had the strongest influence on drinking frequency and binge drinking. The findings may not be news to parents, Kreager says. But they do emphasize the need to learn more about the group of people their children's romantic partners -- and therefore their children -- may be spending time with. Parents should talk with their children about peer pressure and alcohol abuse even before they begin dating, says Diaz, so that as teenagers they can recognize potential hazards in new social situations. They should also make an effort to get to know a new romantic partner in their teen's life, as well as that partner's friends. Health.com: 8 reasons to make time for family dinner . ""Invite them to your home, just as you would with your own son's or daughter's friends"" she says. ""Create an environment where they are comfortable and where you can learn their values."" It's also important to remember that dating is not necessarily a bad thing, Kreager says. Adolescents can also be swayed in a positive direction by peer groups who drink less than they do -- especially boys, who, according to the study, were more likely to binge drink, and who may be more susceptible to a significant other's influences.

"(CNN) -- There was a time when Amy Winehouse was as talked about for her talent as she was for her behavior. Amy Winehouse has undeniable talent, but has become better known for her wild behavior. Her first album, 2003's ""Frank,"" earned rave reviews in her native Britain for her unique voice -- an instrument that featured touches of Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington and Ray Charles -- and clever songwriting, attributes that were enough to put the jazz-inflected album on the shortlist for the UK's prestigious Mercury Prize and win Winehouse a top British songwriting award. Then, when her drinking and drug abuse first became topics of tabloid conversation, she turned the topic around with ""Rehab,"" an autobiographical song that became the first hit off her second album, ""Back to Black."" ""They tried to make me go to rehab,"" she sang, ""I said no no no."" With producers Salaam Remi (who helmed ""Frank"") and Mark Ronson behind the boards, and crack soul band the Dap-Kings offering support, ""Back to Black"" zoomed up the charts and became her American breakthrough, becoming one of the hot titles of 2007. DJs remixed her songs; artists such as Prince and George Michael wanted to work with her. ""Amy is bringing a rebellious rock 'n' roll spirit back to popular music,"" Ronson told Rolling Stone, comparing the singer to early-'60s tough girls such as the Shangri-Las.  See a timeline of Winehouse's career » . Winehouse won five Grammys for her work in February, including honors for best new artist, song of the year and record of the year (both for ""Rehab""). By then, though, the bloom was off the rose.  Watch Winehouse's latest scare » . If Winehouse's deliberately off-the-rack look -- beehive hairdo, heavy eyeliner, haphazard clothes -- once made her seem boho and hip, her repeated appearances on the tabloid pages presented her as pathetic. If ""Rehab"" once seemed an amusing poke in the eye to her minders, it took on darker overtones as Winehouse was hospitalized for various ailments and actually did go to rehab, most recently in early 2008, in an attempt to kick her drug and alcohol addictions. And that doesn't even address her other problems: her sometimes contentious relationship and marriage with the equally troubled Blake Fielder-Civil, currently serving time for assault and obstructing justice after brawling with a pub manager and then offering him $400,000 to keep quiet; her uneven concert appearances, which have included drunken behavior and fan assault; her battles with various authorities, ranging from the American Embassy in London (which denied her a visa to travel to the U.S. to perform at the Grammys) to her father. Which leaves the question of what's next for Winehouse -- who is just 24 (she turns 25 in September) -- forever up in the air. In June, she was rushed to the hospital after fainting; her father, Mitch Winehouse, told reporters that cigarettes and crack have jeopardized her lungs. On Monday she was back in the hospital, this time for an adverse reaction to medication. She's forever working on new material, Mitch Winehouse told the Times of London. ""Amy can be creative when most other people would be checking into a hospice. When she can hardly stand up, she's got her books in front of her, scribbling away,"" he said. But, he added, ""She only writes songs from her personal experiences, and they're all more or less painful. It's a shame. But that's the way she is."" The Winehouse family was always into music. A number of her mother's relatives were jazz musicians, according to Allmusic.com, and Amy grew up listening to Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Dinah Washington. But it was also a clan riven by divorce, with Winehouse's parents splitting when she was 9. In her teens she formed a duo based on the American R&B act Salt 'n' Pepa; it was called Sweet and Sour. Later, an expulsion from a London drama school turned into a break when a musician schoolmate gave her demo tape to a music business executive. Winehouse was eventually signed to Island Records, for whom she put out ""Frank."" Once Winehouse started establishing her wild-child reputation, the tabloids jumped on her story and never let go. They trumpeted her missed concerts, shaky performances, weight loss, shambling manner. One set of photos, in 2007, showed her bloodied after an apparent argument with Fielder-Civil; another, from a raw-looking video, showed her apparently smoking crack. She has a love-hate relationship with the paparazzi, Rolling Stone reported earlier this month, and the photographers appear to have equally mixed feelings: ""She's on loads of crack, but you can see through that,"" Simon Gross, a freelance photographer, told the magazine. ""I just want for her to get better. I'm hoping someday for that set of pictures of her riding her bike in the park or something healthy."" For all that, the talent continues to shine through. Her Grammy performance, finally held at a London club, earned raves; she also pulled herself together for a tribute to Nelson Mandela in late June.

"(CNN) -- The competition for payment processing services, especially mobile payments, is heating up. Last week Google kicked it up a notch by announcing that it's phasing out Google Checkout in favor of the new Google Wallet. This service supports in-store tap-to-pay payments from your phone via near field communications technology, as well as purchases on the web. If you log in to your Google Checkout account now, you'll be notified that you've been switched over to Google Wallet. Any credit cards or other payment information you've saved in Google Checkout will be available in Google Wallet. The catch: Google Wallet isn't yet widely used for in-store purchases. So far its NFC payments are enabled only for Sprint Nexus S users who also have a Citibank MasterCard or a Google prepaid card, and who are making purchases at MasterCard PayPass-enabled merchant locations. So this holiday shopping season, it's unlikely that many people will be waving their phones around to buy holiday gifts. But in the coming year, more U.S. smartphones will be equipped with NFC, bringing a variety of tap-to-pay or wave-to-pay options to consumers. A competing NFC-based mobile phone payment system, ISIS, is launching in some markets (Austin, Texas, and Salt Lake City) in 2012. Why are U.S. retailers slow to adopt NFC payment technology? One reason is the expense and effort required to install NFC-enabled point-of-sale equipment in stores and to integrate it with merchants' systems. It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg dynamic: Retailers typically don't invest in offering a new payment option until they see widespread consumer demand; but few consumers are likely to prefer a payment option that's not yet widely accepted. At the recent Open Mobile Summit, Google VP of Payments Osama Bedier observed: ""Merchants adopt new payment models because they increase sales. If I gave you a payment option that was totally free, merchants wouldn't adopt it unless it increased sales."" GigaOm writer Ryan Kim contends that payments alone aren't enough to make NFC popular. ""Mobile marketing, along with consumer loyalty, will be in the front seat as well and will be critical in helping to drive the growth and adoption of NFC,"" he wrote. ""While the idea of contactless payments is intriguing, there is increasingly an awareness that tapping a phone to pay for an item will not sell itself. ... Discounts, daily deals and loyalty reward programs can be activated through NFC technologies."" At the Open Mobile Summit, Dickson Chu, managing director of digital networks for Citi's Global Enterprise Payments unit, said he also thinks retailers' adoption of NFC will be driven by marketing. But he cautioned: ""Reward discounts are a race to the bottom. Not every merchant engages in that, it's just not part of their economics."" Chu thinks that in the long run, merchants may use NFC not just to deliver deals and coupons, but to deepen relationships with individual consumers. ""That's interesting, and it may be more profitable, but it's a longer term play,"" he noted. Another Open Mobile Summit panelist, PayPal's VP for mobile, David Marcus, made this point: ""Today, retailers learn about customers at the least effective time -- just when they're leaving the store. They'd like to know about you when you arrive at the store, so they can customize your shopping experience and treat you properly."" That may sound creepy to consumers (remember ""Minority Report""?), but in the competitive retail business, merchants are constantly seeking an edge to boost sales and repeat business. The technology of NFC itself is still a moving target, and standards aren't settled. Merchants are wary of investing in the next Betamax. This week a global organization of wireless carriers with GSM mobile networks announced that 45 carriers around the world -- including AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless in the U.S. -- are supporting standards for NFC payments and committed to support and launch services based on it. But, as PaidContent noted, ""The crucial questions now will be whether these carriers stick to their word; and whether handset makers, other infrastructure providers and consumers follow these carriers' lead."" In the meantime, while these issues sort out, Google also announced this week that it's making it easier to integrate Google Wallet into mobile web payments. Granted, at most stores this probably would not make sense yet -- but it might appeal to the many consumers who buy movie tickets online, rather than stand in line at the box office. So Google is partnering with Fandango.com and MovieTickets.com to offer Google Wallet as a payment option for their mobile web checkout. Once this option is implemented, users won't have to try to type their 16-digit credit card number plus the expiration date and security code on their phone in order to buy a movie ticket. Typing on mobile phones is a notorious hassle, and mobile Web users often abandon their online shopping carts when they reach the point of entering payment information. Of course, Fandango.com and Movietickets.com don't just sell tickets on the Web. They also offer their own apps for iPhone, Android, and other smartphone platforms. It's unclear whether Google Wallet will be offered as a payment option for in-app purchases -- but Albert Wenger, a partner with Union Square Ventures, observed that if Google decided to offer this ability, it might ""pull the rug out from underneath Apple's 30% tax on in-app purchases."" The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Google Wallet supports tap-to-pay phone payments using near field communication .

"(CNN) -- The Polish city of Krakow played host to a unique collection of some of the world's leading classical musicians on Tuesday for a special performance to mark the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. Valery Gergiev conducts the World Orchestra for Peace in Jerusalem, October 19, 2008. Bringing together 95 musicians from 35 countries and 75 orchestras the World Orchestra for Peace was founded in 1995 by legendary conductor Sir Georg Solti, a Jewish-Hungarian émigré who fled his homeland in 1939 as Europe plunged into conflict, to mark the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. Led since Solti's death in 1997 by Russian maestro Valery Gergiev, currently Principal Conductor with the London Symphony Orchestra, Tuesday's concert marks the ensemble's first performance since last year's ""Concert for Peace"" in Jerusalem. In a note for the program for Tuesday's concert, former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan -- a former honorary patron of the orchestra -- writes that the group represents ""a practical demonstration of humanity's potential for harmony, tolerance and cooperation.""  Watch highlights of the orchestra's performance in Krakow » . ""Listening to the beautiful music performed by this Orchestra helps us to connect with our fellow human beings across different languages, cultures and traditions,"" says Annan. ""The existence of this orchestra reminds us that peace in our world is possible."" Following Tuesday's performance -- which features the premiere of a specially commissioned piece by Polish composer and Krakow native Krzysztof Penderecki entitled ""Prelude to Peace,"" as well as Gustav Mahler's perennially popular Fifth Symphony -- the orchestra flies to Stockholm to play a festival marking 200 years of peace between Sweden and Finland. WOP Director Charles Kaye told CNN that it was the unique diversity and internationalism of the musicians which made the group so special. ""We've got a young Brazilian violinist called Pablo de Leon who is sitting alongside someone such as Elena Baskina from Novosibirsk in Siberia. And then you have someone like Nabih Bulos who plays with Daniel Barenboim's West-Eastern Divan Orchestra but originally comes from Amman in Jordan. ""They really can't speak to each other but they can share the experience of playing together. Music can often do what the spoken word can't."" With virtually every musician a concert master in their own right, including superstars of the classical world such as violinist Rainer Kuechl of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and clarinetist Larry Combs of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Kaye said the WOP was also ""notches above in terms of sheer quality"" any other similar ensemble. ""We've handpicked the number one players from 70 different orchestras and we are very, very careful,"" said Kaye. ""Nobody can apply to join this orchestra. It is invitation only. This really is an all-star band."" But with barely 72 hours to rehearse -- Kaye received the first copy of Pendereki's score only on Thursday -- the director said it was Gergiev's abilities to bring the best out of the musicians which brought the orchestra to life. ""In our business Maestro Gergiev is acknowledged as one of the great orchestra trainers,"" said Kaye. ""He can really in 72 hours take 95 brilliant solo musicians and make them into a unity. One of his great skills as a conductor is that he knows how to build an orchestra."" In a city which has finally regained its status as one of eastern Europe's leading cultural capitals after the devastation of World War II and decades largely isolated from the West behind the Iron Curtain, Kaye said the orchestra's message of peace through music was especially resonant. ""You can feel the spirit of this ensemble. The camaraderie, the friendship and the fact that this message unites everybody,"" he said. ""We are playing because we've got something to say and music can bring that over. When you play a beautiful piece of music with the emotion and the passion that Gergiev and 95 of the best musicians in the world bring to it, people say they can feel there is something at work here. It sounds daft but music has that power.""","Orchestra play in Krakow, Poland, to mark 70 years since outbreak of WWII .

"(CNN) -- Spanish photographer Javier Espinosa painted a harrowing picture of life inside the shattered center of Syrian resistance in Homs in the days before a full-scale assault by President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Espinosa, who works for the Spanish daily El Mundo, was one of four journalists who escaped this week from Baba Amr, a neighborhood of about five square miles that was shelled for 26 consecutive days before Syrian forces began an assault. ""It's an enormous tragedy,"" Espinosa told Anderson Cooper during an interview that aired Thursday on CNN's ""AC360."" ""And the latest news I have is that it is almost finished because they don't have any more ways of resisting the advance of the army."" Espinosa escaped Baba Amr on Sunday just days before Syrian forces began an assault on the neighborhood that culminated Thursday with rebels announcing a ""tactical retreat,"" saying they were withdrawing to protect the civilians in the neighborhood. The announcement by the opposition came at the same time Syrian forces seized control of the neighborhood. Apparently, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency did not get the message that Espinosa had escaped. Citing a source at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, it reported Thursday that authorities had discovered the body of Espinosa along with those of Colvin and Ochlik after the Syrian Army ""cleansed Baba Amr from the foreign-backed armed groups of terrorists."" After DNA analysis confirms the identities, the bodies will be handed over to the embassies of Poland, on behalf of the U.S. Embassy, France and Spain, it said. In an interview from Beirut, Espinosa said that the report of his death ""would be a nice joke"" if not for the suffering of the people of Baba Amr. Espinosa described a dire humanitarian crisis in Homs, with dwindling food, water and medical supplies. In Baba Amr, the situation was worse. ""They had nothing. They didn't receive (anything) at all,"" he said. Espinosa was in the makeshift media center during last week's shelling by Syrian forces that killed American Marie Colvin of The Sunday Times of London and French photographer Remi Ochlik and wounded French reporter Edith Bouvier of La Monde newspaper. When rockets began striking the media center, Espinosa and the other journalists were told by an opposition activist to get out of the building that was taking direct hits. But when the activist ""heard the sound of an incoming shell,"" he tried to turn the journalists back, Espinosa said. Espinosa said he was able to take cover by a wall. ""But Marie and Remi were already outside, and they received the full explosion of the rocket,"" he said. Espinosa described the shelling by Syrian forces as ""systematic."" He described a typical day in the neighborhood as one of routine horror: Shelling began at 6 a.m. and continued until 1 p.m., when the army stopped for precisely one hour. ""They just stop for lunch,"" he told CNN. At 2 p.m., the shelling resumed until 6 p.m., when it ended until picking up again the following morning, he said. Espinosa escaped to Lebanon with British journalist Paul Conroy, who was also wounded in the shelling attack. Espinosa and Conroy fled Baba Amr along with Bouvier and French photographer William Daniels. But Bouvier and Daniels were forced to turn back after they were targeted by Syrian security forces, according to the opposition group Avaaz, who says its activists helped guide the four out of Syria. A second evacuation attempt on Tuesday moved Daniels and Bouvier to a safer neighborhood in Homs, and then on Wednesday the opposition activists got the two out along with a number of civilians. The French Embassy in Beirut said Bouvier was in stable condition on Friday and expected to be flown to France later in the day.","Javier Espinosa was one of four journalists trapped in Baba Amr .

"(CNN) -- It is one of the most important medals in Olympics history. In 1936 Jesse Owens won it and three others at the Berlin Games, spoiling Adolf Hitler's planned showcase of Aryan superiority. Imagine the shock to Nazi Party elites when a black American, the son of a sharecropper and grandson of slaves, stared down fascist propaganda, bested his rivals and took home four gold medals. Hitler was furious, but tens of thousands of ordinary Germans cheered him on. Documentary explores Jesse Owens' life beyond victory . Owens won the 100- and 200-meter sprints, the long jump and ran the opening leg for the winning 4x100-meter U.S. relay team. Sports Illustrated chose Owens' feat as the greatest Olympic moment of all time. So auctioneers predict the medal will sell for more than $1 million. ""It leaves one nearly speechless to behold this medal. It survives as one of the world's most poignant symbols of triumph,"" the vice president of SCP Auctions, Dan Imler, said in a written statement. No one knows where the other three original medals are, the auction house said. As of Monday night, the online bidding had reached more than $200,000. The medal was given by Owens to friend Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson a few years after the Olympics, and the late entertainer's widow Elaine Plaines-Robinson is selling the medal, the auction house said. The forgotten godfathers of black American sport . Owens wasn't able to immediately cash in on his Olympic glory. Instead of earning a living from his extraordinary athleticism, he ended up opening a dry cleaning business and occasionally raced against horses at the behest of promoters. ""People said it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse, but what was I supposed to do?"" Owens once said, according to an ESPN.com article. ""I had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals."" Author William O. Johnson wrote in 1990 that Robinson set up Owens as the bandleader of 12-piece big band. All he had to do was introduce each song and croon some. ""Well, I couldn't play an instrument. I'd just stand up front and announce the numbers. They had me sing a little, but that was a horrible mistake. I can't carry a tune in a bucket,"" Johnson wrote, quoting Owens. Owens later was able to make a good living as a public relations man and public speaker. Robinson passed away in 1949; Owens died in 1980. The auction closes Saturday.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At the peak of Pakistan's relentless downpours, a year's worth of rain fell in a day, disrupting the lives of 15 million men, women and children across the country. They might have otherwise have been celebrating fast-breaking feasts every evening during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. And in two days, they might have celebrated independence -- Pakistan was partitioned off from India on August 14, 1947, a date observed with immense national pride. Instead, Pakistanis this year will be surrounded by the effects of the worst natural calamity since its creation, immersed literally in a uniquely dynamic disaster unlike anything they have seen before. Thursday, almost two weeks into the crisis, President Asif Ali Zardari finally got a firsthand look. He had been away in Europe during the worst of the flooding, an absence that was deeply felt in Pakistan. He and his government came under blistering criticism for a perceived lack of action in helping those in need. Presidential spokeswoman Farahnaz Ispahani said the criticism of Zardari was unfair and that he has been involved from the start in directing relief efforts. ""The president has always been concerned with the welfare of Pakistan's people, notwithstanding the venomous propaganda of his opponents,"" Ispahani said. ""His visit to flood-affected areas should effectively shut up those who would rather play politics than focus on helping those uprooted by raging waters."" But while the government defended its response, the scale of human misery started to become all the more apparent. The death toll climbed Thursday to 1,343, the Pakistan Disaster Authority said. Another 1,588 people have been injured and 352,291 people have been rescued. More than 722,600 houses and 4,600 villages have been damaged or destroyed. More people have been affected in the flooding than in the 2005 Pakistan earthquakes, the 2004 Indonesia tsunami and the January earthquake in Haiti combined. In  the mountainous north, water funneled down treacherous slopes, quickly engulfing the roads below. It surged down the mighty Indus River, spreading economic, political and social woes through the heart of Pakistan. The fetid stench of death filled the air in many places where mere seconds of unstoppable water ended lives. Those who bore witness, even those who thought they had seen everything in this land marred by crisis and killing, were baffled by the suffering wrought by the monsoons. Public health officials fear a second wave of deaths that might be caused by waterborne diseases if action is not taken quickly enough. More than 1 million Pakistanis are in need of clean water. Dr. Shahid Iqbal already is struggling to keep up with the demand for medical attention, so many people are sick with diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis. ""We are facing much of the problems with the drinking water, because there is no electricity,"" he said. Towns such as Nowshera, in northwestern Pakistan, have been particularly hard hit. The stagnant water forced tens of thousands into temporary government camps. Shar Ali, 60, shares a flooded tent with eight family members after losing everything -- his house, all his possessions. His family survived with only the clothes on their back. The United Nations estimated that 6 million Pakistanis are, like Ali, in direct need of emergency aid, mainly food. Ali said food has been distributed in Nowshera, but in chaotic conditions. No one in this squalid camp of 18,000 people wants to miss getting their hands on the last few bags of rice. Further north, at Chagdarra, lies another common challenge. Like 278 other crossings in the province, the Chagderra bridge was swept away by the sudden torrent. Dump trucks are trying to close the gap. And men are finishing a suspension bridge so people and supplies can get to the other side. In Mingora, Reza Khan picks through the bricks that used to be his house. He and his 7-year-old daughter Samreen are suddenly homeless -- they will have to find somewhere to sleep here, amid the wreckage and rubble. Pakistani soldiers are already familiar with the towns and villages that dot the Swat Valley. Last year, they fought fiercely to regain control of the from the Taliban. The task at hand is daunting in a different way. The Taliban may have gone, but Islamist charities with alleged links to terrorist groups are handing out food and, with it, a clear message. ""The government is not working properly. That is why the people are working on their own self, so we are also from those people and we are joining hands with those people,"" said one man who did not want to be identified. Four U.S. Army Chinook helicopters arrived here from Afghanistan to help deliver aid, competing with the Islamist charities. A silver ribbon of destruction guides them to the farthest reaches of the Swat Valley towards Kalam. The Chinook crew can see the rippled bridges and vast swaths of land eviscerated by water, scoured clean of vegetation, buildings and people. What lies below is a landscape robbed of color, robbed of signs of life. The town of Kalam was once the Shangri-La of the Hindu Kush. Now the tourist destination is hell on Earth. The Americans unload bags of flour. For desperate recipients, the Chinooks are a lifeline. The aid situation is complicated by the fact that the humanitarian agencies are themselves victims of the flood. The International Red Cross warehouse outside Nowshera should have been a busy distribution hub. Instead, it sits under several feet of water. At its height, the water was three times deeper than it is now. It soaked 25,000 canvas tents in sewage-polluted water. The Red Cross had supplies worth $15 million in the warehouse. Officials don't know how much they will be able to salvage. ""It makes me sad. The idea of pre-positioning stock is to allow us to move quickly with distribution of relief items, and this is back to square one, so to speak,"" said Felix De Vries, of the Red Cross. At a nearby camp, Basree could use a few of the Red Cross supplies. She is 70 and shivering outside a makeshift shelter. ""We only managed to get our children out of the house, we have nothing literally nothing the only help we get is from members of the public,"" said Basree's grandson. Some people are so desperate that they have offered their children to strangers, hoping they'll take them away from all this. Others worry how they will feed their families with so many crops submerged and prices of tomatoes, cucumbers and other vegetables and fruits soaring in the markets. ""The crop has been lost and it is a race against time to ensure the next sowing season can be met,"" said Jean-Maurice Ripert, the United Nations special envoy. For now, though, the immediate focus is on evacuation. Between breaks in the weather, men, women and children rush onto helicopters. Some are clearly terrified about their first flight, even though they know it will take them to safety. CNN's Reza Sayah and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Public officials fear a second wave of deaths from contaminated water .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- At least 15 people were killed and more than 40 wounded in battles between the Jihadist militant group Ansar al Sharia and forces loyal to a renegade general in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi on Monday, according to hospitals in the city. Fighting erupted at about 2 a.m. when Ansar al Sharia fighters surrounded and attacked a Benghazi base belonging to a Libyan army special forces unit that allied itself with renegade Gen. Khalifa Haftar, according to residents and Col. Mohammed al-Hijazi, a spokesman for the self-declared Libyan National Army. Battles continued for hours in different parts of the city through the morning hours. Live pictures on the privately owned Libya al-Ahrar TV showed plumes of black smoke rising as explosions and gunfire could be heard in the distance. The fighting in Libya's second-largest city comes more than two weeks after the previously retired Haftar -- without the consent of the Libyan government and military command in Tripoli -- launched a ground an air assault against Islamist groups in Benghazi. Most of the casualties that al-Jalaa Hospital received Monday were Libyan army soldiers. The Benghazi Medical Center, meanwhile, said the son of its director was killed when a shell hit the director's home during Monday's fighting. Hospitals in the city called for blood donations as security forces asked residents to avoid the areas of fighting. ""We remain concerned about the safety of Benghazi residents who are caught in the armed clashes. We urge all those involved in the clashes to spare residents and infrastructure, and urge Libyan authorities to ensure the protection of Benghazi residents,"" said Hanan Salah, Libya researcher for Human Rights Watch. The clashes appeared to be the most intense to hit Benghazi since Haftar's May 16 offensive, dubbed Operation Dignity, against Islamist militia bases in and near Benghazi. More than 70 people were killed in that assault. Without the blessing of the central government and the military command in Tripoli, some Libyan military members joined Haftar's offensive. The move underscored the difficulty that Tripoli has had in controlling the security situation in Benghazi, more than 400 miles to the east of the capital, since the 2011 revolution that toppled longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi. In recent days, forces loyal to Haftar have launched airstrikes in the city, according to residents and videos uploaded onto social media sites. One of the main targets of Haftar's Benghazi campaign, which he said is an open-ended war to purge Libya of extremist groups, is Ansar al Sharia, which the United States earlier this year named a terrorist group. The United States says the group was involved in a September 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound, killing Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Anger has been mounting in Benghazi, the cradle of Libya's 2011 revolution, over deteriorating security in the past two years. Bombings, killings and kidnappings became near daily in the city, and an assassination campaign mainly targeting security forces intensified in recent months. Foreigners, judges, activists and, most recently, an outspoken newspaper editor are among the victims of these assassinations. No group has claimed responsibility for the violence that has gripped the city, but officials and residents have blamed it on Islamist extremist groups that have grown in size and influence since the revolution. Libya's weak central government has been unable to secure the city, and one army unit in Benghazi, known as the special forces, has clashed several times with Ansar al Sharia since November. Country divided over Haftar's campaign . Haftar's campaign has further divided an already polarized country. A number of military units, officials and many Libyans support his offensive against what they say is terrorism in their country. Opponents, including moderate Islamists, have described the move by Haftar as a coup attempt. While many say they do not support Haftar the person, they are backing his campaign as a first significant use of force against extremist groups. However, some fear the campaign does not make a distinction between the extremist Jihadist groups and moderate Islamists. On Friday, hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Tripoli, Benghazi and other cities in support of Haftar's Operation Dignity. In the capital, protesters carried a symbolic coffin -- with ""Ansar al Sharia"" written on one of its sides -- through Tripoli's Martyrs Square. Demonstrators hit it with their shoes before stomping on it and smashing it. The latest wave of outrage against the Jihadist group came a few days after one of its leaders held a news conference accusing Haftar of carrying out a war against Islam and warned of consequences if the offensive continues. ""We remind the criminal Haftar and those who chose his path ... their insistence on this dirty war will unleash hell on him and the whole region,"" Mohammed al-Zahawi said. Al-Zahawi accused the United States of supporting Haftar and threatened it if it intervened. ""We remind America, if it tries to intervene, of its heinous defeats in Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. Libya ... will only show America what is more severe than what it saw there,"" he said. The United States has denied any support to the campaign or recent contact with Haftar. Meanwhile, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb released a statement calling on Libyans to fight Haftar. The statement, which appeared on Jihadist sites Sunday, said Haftar was waging a ""war on Islam under the pretext of fighting terrorism"" -- a war it said was backed by the United States and financed by Arab Gulf countries. The al Qaeda affiliate in the region described Haftar's assault as a ""Crusader plot"" to stop the implementation of Sharia, or Islamic law, in Libya. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Ansar al Sharia fighters attack a base belonging to a Libyan army unit loyal to Gen. Khalifa Haftar .

"(CNN) -- When Matt Jones missed a six-foot putt last year, it cost him a coveted place at the Masters. The Australian golfer made up for it on Sunday, clinching the last spot in the field for Augusta next week after snatching his first PGA Tour victory in 156 starts at the Houston Open. While his lip-out at the BMW Championship in August denied him a spot at the Tour Championship, which guarantees entry to the following year's opening major, this time the 33-year-old made sure in dramatic style. He drained a 46-foot birdie putt to force a playoff with longtime leader Matt Kuchar, and then sunk a 42-yard chip on the first extra hole while the American could not match it from the greenside bunker. Jones will make his Masters debut alongside fellow Australian Steven Bowditch, who last week clinched entry when he caught Kuchar with nine holes to play at the Texas Open and also went on to win his first PGA Tour title. That makes four winners from the southern hemisphere continent this year, with Jason Day having won the World Match Play Championship in February and John Senden the Valspar Championship last month. Compatriot Adam Scott, who will be defending his Masters crown, was third at the Arnold Palmer Invitational the week after Senden's win after blowing a big lead on the final day. Jones shot 66 while Kuchar -- who blew a four-stroke overnight lead -- carded 72 as both finished on 15-under 273. Spain's Sergio Garcia was two shots back after a 70, with Cameron Tringale fourth ahead of fellow Americans Shawn Stefani and Rickie Fowler. Former world No. 1 Rory McIlroy showed form ahead of Augusta with a seven-under-par 65 that left him tied for seventh in a group including fellow two-time major winner Retief Goosen of South Africa, who closed with 70. ""I wanted to shoot something in the 60s at least today to give me some positive vibes going into Augusta,"" McIlroy said. ""I couldn't be in a better mood getting on the plane and heading over (to Augusta) tonight."" American veteran Phil Mickelson confirmed his fitness ahead of his bid for a fourth Green Jacket at Augusta as he finished tied for 12th after a final-round 71, alongside former world No. 1 Lee Westwood and 2003 British Open champion Ben Curtis. ""I'm a little nervous heading into next week,"" said Mickelson, yet to win in 2014 and battling injury setbacks. ""I haven't had the results, I haven't been in contention, I haven't won this year, so I'm certainly nervous about my chances, but it's my favorite week of the year.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani military carried out airstrikes early Wednesday in the country's northwest, targeting alleged militant hideouts in the volatile region. The army claimed it killed 60 militants, including some key commanders, and injured 30 others in North Waziristan, a loosely governed tribal area that borders Afghanistan. A local Taliban commander, Umar Khurrassani, challenged that report, and said 39 tribesmen, including women and children, were killed. If those tribesmen were affiliated with the Taliban commander, the Pakistani army would consider some of them militants. One area resident told CNN that up to 20 civilians had been killed in the airstrikes. Malik Gul Saleh Jan said that it's difficult to assess the exact figure of the dead and injured because it is hard to reach some residents by phone. Many left their homes due to fear of shelling and bombing, he said. Earlier this year, the military carried out a series of strikes in the region, considered to be a stronghold for extremist groups.","Pakistani military claims it killed 60 militants in North Waziristan .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Is Twitter aiding and abetting terrorism? The director of an Israeli legal outfit says yes, and is threatening to sue the micro-blogging site if it doesn't change its policies.

""It has come to our attention that Twitter Inc. provides social media and associated services to such foreign terrorist organizations,"" Darshan-Leitner wrote. ""Please be advised that (doing so) is illegal and will expose Twitter Inc. and its officers to both criminal prosecution and civil liability to American citizens and others victimized"" by Hezbollah, al-Shabaab and other foreign terrorist entities. Twitter declined to comment when contacted by CNN. In her letter, Darshan-Leitner noted that Hezbollah and al-Shabaab are officially designated as terrorist organizations under U.S. law. She also cited a 2010 Supreme Court case -- Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project -- which upheld a key provision of the Patriot Act prohibiting material support to groups designated as terrorist outfits. ""Your provision of social media and associated services to Hezbollah and other foreign terrorist organizations would constitute the type of seemingly innocuous material support that would render your company and you personally criminally and civilly liable,"" she told Twitter CEO Richard Costolo. Hezbollah-controlled al-Manar television currently maintains a Twitter account with roughly 7,500 followers. Other groups considered terrorist organizations by the United States also maintain accounts. Hamas, the Islamist group that rules the Gaza Strip, posts regularly on at least one government-controlled account. Darshan-Leitner says she realizes there will be stiff opposition to a potential lawsuit from free speech advocates, but told CNN she nevertheless hopes Twitter will change its policies. ""Once you bring it to their attention, they cannot say that they don't know,"" she said. Aden Fine, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, told CNN that the Supreme Court ""has not directly addressed the issue of whether any speech allegedly supportive of a designated terrorist organization is unlawful."" But ""the government can't force private companies to censor lawful speech just because the government doesn't like the speech or the people making the speech,"" he said. Fine noted that since the Internet depends on private companies such as Twitter to function, any clampdown or adverse ruling could be used to restrict everyone's online communications. Social networks Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have been lauded for the role they played in the Arab Spring, a series of anti-regime protests that erupted across the Middle East starting in late 2010. The online networks and instant messaging services were used extensively to spread the word about demonstrations, especially in the case of the Egyptian uprising that toppled longtime strongman President Hosni Mubarak. A number of governments, however, have started arguing for stricter controls. Authorities in the United Kingdom say rioters used social the networks to coordinate mass civil disobedience earlier this year in London. State prosecutors in Mexico have accused two people of terrorism and sabotage by claiming that their Twitter posts helped spread false rumors about a school attack, leading to real-life violence on the streets of Veracruz. The Shurat HaDin Israel Law Center describes itself as a civil rights organization dedicated to ""combating the terrorist organizations and the regimes that support them through lawsuits litigated in courtrooms around the world."" It supported a similar campaign earlier this year directed at social media giant Facebook. Among other things, the center succeeded in getting Facebook to pull down a page created by Palestinian activists calling for a ""Third Intifada"" against Israel. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","The Shurat HaDin Israel Law Center is threatening legal action against Twitter .

"(CNN) -- An extradition hearing will be held Friday for the boyfriend of a Michigan woman whose body was pulled from a swamp in Indiana, authorities said. Divers found the body of Dawn Marie Fital, 45, stuffed in a suitcase Thursday. Her legs, arms and head were bound with duct tape, said Rob Arnold, a spokesman for the Lake County police. The 45-year-old had been missing since Monday. Her boyfriend, Greg Noack, 44, was taken into police custody in Merrillville, Indiana, near where her body was discovered. Michigan prosecutors have charged the suspect, who is being held in Indiana, with murder. He will appear for an extradition hearing at the Lake County magistrate court jail Friday morning. Police believe he killed Fital in Michigan, then drove across state lines, where he dumped her body in Indiana. There is no word on when Fital's body will be returned to Michigan. An autopsy has been scheduled for Saturday.","Divers find the body of Dawn Marie Fital, 45 .

"(CNN) -- Middle schooler Katarina Lucardie didn't expect to see her classmates cry when she decided to show them her big secret. She was bald and didn't know how to tell her peers. But after teaming up with her teachers, the Colorado Springs, Colorado, student helped make a documentary about why she has no hair. Now she is the face of bravery for her classmates. It all started after Katarina wrote a letter to her school counselor: ""I have a disease and it makes me lose my hair,"" she wrote. The 11-year-old was born with alopecia areata, an autoimmune skin disease that results in hair loss on the scalp and other places on the body. The condition affects 2% of Americans, both male and female, according to the National Institutes of Health. People with alopecia generally start losing hair in their youth, which was the case for Katarina. At age 8, she started seeing patches of her hair on the floor of the tub after taking showers and on her pillow after getting out of bed. With no real cure available, Katarina went completely bald at 9. She sported a medium-length black wig throughout much of elementary school, but after graduating, she approached her mom and said she wanted to stop wearing it in middle school. She said the wig irritated her scalp, especially during gym activities, and she felt hot while wearing it. But most importantly, Katarina says, she just wanted to be herself around her friends. ""I was fearful she was going to get picked on. She was picked on a little in elementary school,"" said her mother, Carmela Aranda. She had seen students questioning Katarina about her condition, asking her why she was losing her hair and whether she was sick. Aranda was nervous that by not wearing the wig to her new middle school, Katarina would be subjecting herself to bullying and ridicule. Bullying was something Aranda was all too familiar with. After a high fever and ear infection, she lost her hearing at the age of 1 and grew up as the only deaf girl at her school. ""I grew up in the '70s,"" she explained. ""The kids at school didn't know how to interact with me. They made fun of my voice."" It was the kind of experience she didn't want for her daughter. But Katarina was determined to stop wearing her wig and approached her middle school counselor, Jennicca Mabe, about her condition in private. Mabe had similar concerns that Katarina might get picked on but worked with other teachers and the administration at Skyview Middle School to figure out how to share Katarina's story with the rest of her peers. With Aranda's blessing, Mabe and other school officials enlisted Katarina's teachers to help create a short documentary about Katarina and what it was like living with alopecia. ""(Mabe) thought that if you educate people and if you tell them about things and you tell them that it isn't contagious, that people won't pick on me,"" Katarina said. Katarina's science teacher, Connie Sandel, was one of the participants in the documentary. ""I was a little bit surprised,"" she said, when she learned that Katarina wanted to tell other students she was bald. ""Most kids don't come forward in middle school and do something like that. In middle school, kids can be a little harsh, and bullying can be a problem. But I wanted to support her in what she wanted to do,"" Sandel said. The documentary was screened this month in the school's library for several groups of students, including Katarina's class. ""I was sitting at the back so all these people wouldn't be looking at me,"" Katarina said. ""And I watched everyone, and people were crying, and I felt sorry. ""I knew that maybe the teachers would cry, but I never expected that the kids would cry,"" she added. Her mother was also at the screening and had an interpreter translate the film for her. ""I cried. I think everyone in the room cried. I knew we made the right decision. The school was really supportive. They didn't have to do this, you know,"" Aranda said. After the documentary, Katarina, accompanied by two of her teachers, answered questions from her peers. She also explained to her class that the following week she would not be wearing her wig anymore. ""It was very inspiring,"" Aranda said. ""The kids were really interested, and they asked a lot of questions like 'Does it hurt?' and 'Was your scalp itchy?' "" Many students were surprised by the film and admitted that they never suspected that Katarina wore a wig in the first place. Some students even told Katarina that she looked even better without a wig. Aranda couldn't help but think of how brave Katarina was, standing in front of her classmates and answering their questions. ""She was just determined to do it. She wanted to be herself and not cover up and mask who she was. She was very courageous."" The following week, Katarina came to school with a hat instead of a wig. It's winter in Colorado Springs, and she says her scalp gets cold without something covering it. Sandel says her students are reacting normally to Katarina without her wig. ""I let my first period class ask her questions, and they didn't. Everyone seemed ready to move on,"" she said. Looking back at the screening, Katarina is happy with her decision to tell her classmates that she has no hair. ""I want people to like me for me and not what I look like,"" Katarina said, ""because that's how I can find my true friends.""","Katarina Lucardie wanted to stop wearing a wig .

"Washington (CNN) -- Whether it's an Army helmet with a thicker shell and better padding, or underwear that can protect a Marine private's privates, the U.S. military is looking at sending the latest gear to Afghanistan so the troops can come home safe and sound. Next month, the Army is going to start sending the ""ballistic boxers"" to soldiers in Afghanistan, and the Marines intend for each of their troops there to have four pairs of the ""protective undergarments,"" as they are formally known, before the end of the year. The heavy silk boxers, which look like shorts that professional cyclists wear, won't stop a bullet or shrapnel from an IED. But the silk can stop small projectiles like those kicked up by an explosion. ""It is expected to prevent fine sands and particles that are thrown up by explosives, so that the tissue wounds are cleaner, less ragged and easier to treat,"" said Lt. Jamie Larson, a Marines Corps spokesperson. And since the silk is treated with antimicrobial agents, the boxers help protect injured troops from wound infections. While it may not sound like it affords much protection, silk is actually a very strong fiber, said Brig. Gen. Peter Fuller, who heads the Army office that tests and develops new protective gear. He noted that silk was used by medieval knights ""under the mail armor"" to protect against wounds from swords and other weapons. The Marines haven't actually started buying the boxers yet, but the Army has chosen boxers from a company in Northern Ireland called Cooneen Watts & Stone that is already making them for the British military in Afghanistan. Silk boxers aren't the only step the military is taking to protect the groin. They are testing various cups that a male soldier will wear over his genitals. One of the cups being considered is made of stainless steel; another is made from high-molecular-weight polyethylene, a plastic that is lighter than Kevlar but better at stopping bullets. ""They all basically work to slow down the fragments. We are looking to prevent penetration of the genitals,"" said Col. Bill Cole, an Army officer overseeing projects aimed at better protecting soldiers. In addition, the Army and Marines are looking at undershorts that will have pockets that will hold Kevlar pads to protect the wearer's femoral artery, the main blood vessel to the legs. While Kevlar may be the answer to protecting arteries and groins, Kevlar helmets may soon be history. Kevlar is a fabric that can, when arranged in multiple layers, stop most bullets. The Army and Marines are working on upgrading their head protection to the Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH). The outer shell is made from the same high-molecular-weight polyethylene plastic being investigated for groin protection. The thicker protective shell would make the helmet lighter than the current Kevlar model. The Army hopes to start giving those to soldiers in Afghanistan by November. Army officials recently met with counterparts from the National Football League and NASCAR to study ways to design helmets that provide better protection from blunt force contact. They came away with an understanding that U.S. military helmets are already very good. ""Football helmets and football pads are good for football; combat helmets and combat pads are good for combat. And so we're not saying anything about deficiencies in the NFL system,"" William Moss, a physicist who studied the helmets, said Tuesday at a briefing in the Pentagon. But a study by Moss at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California found the military helmets could be better, especially the foam padding inside the helmet. ""We decided to change the thickness of the foams and look at the results,"" Moss said. Currently, Kevlar helmets come with 3/4-inch foam pads inside. In recent months, the U.S. Army has provided some soldiers with 1-inch pads to make the helmet fit better. By adding a quarter-inch of padding, or even an eighth of an inch, ""there is a very big effect"" -- a 24% reduction in force to the skull, to be exact, Moss said. But that discovery spawned other concerns. The Army doesn't have any pads that add even one-eighth-inch of padding to the current helmet, according to Brig. Gen. Peter Fuller. Adding even that much padding may force soldiers to move up to a larger-size helmet. Right now about half of all soldiers wear large helmets. An extra-large weighs a half-pound more, and according to Cole, when Army soldiers were asked about wearing a heavier helmet they said they don't want it ""if it's even an ounce heavier."" Another project in development to help protect soldiers' heads is a sensor that keeps track of sudden shocks to the helmet. The wireless sensor is about the size of a silver dollar that fits inside the helmet, under the pads, and works similar to a flight data recorder in a passenger jet. The Army plans to use the data from the sensors to help better understand what happens to a human brain exposed to sudden blunt force. One day, doctors in a combat hospital may be able to take the sensor for a soldier who is being treated for IED injuries and download the data on the sensor and better understand what exactly the soldier was exposed to and how strong the explosion was. But that, like much of the other technology being tested and developed, will not be helping the troops in danger today in Afghanistan. And the Army can't say when, if ever, some of this gear might make it to the battlefield.","So-called ballistic boxers to be shipped to soldiers and Marines in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- The Internet is the largest collection of humanity's knowledge. Through my work in music, I want to show people that the Internet can not only break down barriers but also redefine the limits of what is possible. The polymaths and Renaissance men of yesteryear had to devote their lives to the pursuit of the same knowledge that we can access with one click. I am fortunate to come from a family inclined toward the arts -- thanks to which, they are all very difficult to impress. My great-grandfather was an Eastern music scholar and multi-instrumentalist. He played instruments like the sarangi, the harmonium and the violin. He traveled throughout Pakistan and Britain to develop and refine his musical style. Watch Usman Riaz perform at TEDGlobal with Preston Reed . My grandmother, choosing to follow in her father's footsteps, became an Eastern classical musician and a stage performer. Her brother, my great-uncle, is one of Pakistan's last remaining orators -- professional storytellers who read old stories written by famous writers of the Subcontinent. His wife is one of the country's leading Kathak dancers. Their son, my cousin, is one of the country's greatest percussion and tabla players.My parents were also stage performers, and recognized that I had musical aptitude at an early age. I was classically trained in piano since age 6 -- which is how I fell in love with Western classical composers like Mozart and Chopin. As I got older, I wanted to branch out and experiment with other instruments. But I felt very limited in Pakistan. Music teachers there are in great demand and tend to focus only on Western classical or Eastern classical music. It had taken my great-grandfather his whole life to master and play his chosen instruments. Now, I had no choice but to let the Internet be my teacher. TED.com: Kaki King rocks out to ""Pink Noise"" I watched hundreds and hundreds of videos online. I would close my eyes and listen to the audio again and again, trying to decipher each note. Or I would pause the clips at just the right moment to examine the musicians' finger positions. As time went by, it got easier for me to pick up on things from the Internet. I grew more confident, which allowed me to branch out and develop. I started playing percussion instruments, the mandolin, the harmonica and more. Thanks to my classical training, my musical ear also improved, which enabled me to write and arrange orchestral pieces. Here's an example, 'The Waves', which I wrote when I was 17. TED.com: Raul Midon plays ""Peace on Earth"" On the Internet, I can manufacture my own philharmonic orchestra, with string sections and woodwinds playing my music from all over the world, as I did with my orchestral album ""Circus in the Sky,"" which is a full representation of my approach to music and storytelling. It is a concept album, each piece is a progression through the innocence and playfulness of youth, the joys and sorrows of life as one gets older, spiritual awakening and finally death. I applied to Boston's Berklee College of Music after high school, but decided not to go to the audition for admission. I wanted to record my music professionally in a studio instead, to clear my head of all the musical ideas that were already building up in my system. TED.com: Natalie MacMaster fiddles in real time . I try to not limit myself to music; I get involved in every creative process, such as directing and writing my own musical short films to complement my compositions and I do all the artwork that accompanies my music, such as the sleeve paintings for the ""Circus in the Sky"" CDs. It was an honor to be chosen as a 2012 TED Fellow. To perform onstage with Preston Reed, one of my all-time favorite musicians, was something I will never forget for the rest of my life. And I was able to discuss learning with TED curator Chris Anderson, who has described how the Internet is encouraging people around the world to develop skills, such as the ability to learn to play musical instruments, that might have previously been out of reach.Apart from my classical training in piano, I have learned everything I know about music by watching other people -- many of them the best in their fields -- play online. To me, that has been the best way to learn. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Usman Riaz.","Usman Riaz: Acquiring skill in music has long required learning from teachers .

"(CNN) -- North Carolina's governor says he agreed to repeal a law that allowed inmates to challenge their death sentences on racial grounds because it effectively banned capital punishment in the state. North Carolina legislators barred death sentences ""sought or obtained on the basis of race"" in 2009, when both houses of the state General Assembly were under Democratic control. The, legislation, known as the Racial Justice Act, allowed condemned convicts to use statistical analysis to argue that race played a role in their sentencing. Republicans who took control of the Legislature in 2010 weakened the law last year, overriding a veto by then-Gov. Bev Perdue, a Democrat. Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican elected in 2012, followed legislative action and signed its complete repeal Wednesday. ""Nearly every person on death row, regardless of race, has appealed their death sentence under the Racial Justice Act,"" McCrory said in a statement Wednesday. ""The state's district attorneys are nearly unanimous in their bipartisan conclusion that the Racial Justice Act created a judicial loophole to avoid the death penalty and not a path to justice."" The state still allowed capital punishment even while the Racial Justice Act was on the books. But state Democrats said the law resulted in at least four convicts being taken off death row after judges ruled that their sentences resulted from racial bias, with their sentences commuted to life in prison instead. About 53% of the 153 convicts awaiting execution in North Carolina are black, according to the state Department of Public Safety, while about 40% are white. African-Americans make up about 22% of the state's population, according to Census figures. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","The 2009 law allowed inmates to argue that race played a role in sentences .

"(CNN) -- A Missouri man was sentenced on Wednesday to 20 years in federal prison for his role in the years-long sexual torture of a ""mentally deficient"" young woman that included electrical shock and mutilation, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri told CNN. A federal judge accepted a plea agreement from Edward Bagley Sr., 46, in a Kansas City courtroom on Wednesday morning, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. In January, he pleaded guilty to one of the 11 counts he faced for having a sexual relationship with a minor, who was identified only by the initials ""FV"" (or Female Victim) in official documents. Bagley faced life imprisonment. Bagley held the victim as a sex slave from December 2002 to February 27, 2009, in his Lebanon, Missouri, trailer home. The woman -- who was a runaway minor at the time when the abuse began -- was sometimes ""hung upside down,"" ""water boarded"" and had animals she cared for shot in front of her by Bagley to coerce her to engage in commercial sex acts, the indictment read. ""In or about December 2002, (Bagley) invited FV, a 16-year-old minor, who grew up in foster care homes, into his residence after she ran away from home and promised her 'a great life,' including, but not limited to, making her a model and a dancer, and 'making her dreams come true,'"" the indictment read. ""(Bagley) advertised and publicized FV over the Internet and in live web cam sessions as his slave who would engage in sexual acts and could be tortured during live online sessions, or in person,"" an indictment read. Once the victim turned 18, Bagley had ""FV sign a 'sex slavery' contract"" and told her the contract ""legally bound her to him as his 'sex slave' with a term that 'never' ended,"" according to the indictment. During the six years of abuse, Bagley also performed abortions on the victim using things like ""vacuums, and clothing hangers for the purpose of terminating the pregnancies,"" the indictment said. The victim was discovered by first responders after she suffered cardiac arrest during a torture session on February 27, 2009, the indictment read. Five other defendants, including four men and Bagley's wife, Marilyn Bagley, are scheduled to be sentenced this week. The four men were alleged to have traded Bagley things like ""cigarettes, computer hard drives, sadomasochism videos, coats and meats"" to use the young woman as a sex slave, according to the indictment. The U.S. Attorney's Office said that lawyers for the victim were seeking $738,250 for physical and psychological trauma to their client.","Edward Bagley Sr. kept a ""mentally deficient"" runaway as a sex slave six years .

"(CNN) -- Any kid can dream up a roller coaster. But those who visit a new exhibit at Walt Disney World's Epcot theme park can actually take a ride on their fantasy creations. An artist's rendering of the ""Sum of All Thrills"" interactive ride, opening Wednesday at Disney World. Epcot on Wednesday opened a new attraction called ""Sum of All Thrills,"" which lets kids use computer tablets to design a virtual roller coaster, bobsled track or plane ride. After inputting their designs, kids climb into a robotic carriage that uses virtual-reality technology to help them experience the ride they've created. ""This is really the next generation -- where there's a lot more personalization involved"" in the amusement-park experience, said Eric Goodman, Disney's lead project manager on the ride. This make-your-own-ride approach appears to be a growing trend in the world of amusement parks and museums. Taking cues from the video game industry, park and ride designers have realized that people -- especially young ones -- want to interact with and even design their own thrill rides. In addition to the new Epcot ride in Orlando, Florida, two Disney theme parks feature a ride called ""Toy Story Mania,"" which lets riders shoot at targets as they roll down the track and, in doing so, shape their own ride experience. Another Disney attraction, CyberSpace Mountain, caters to adults and kids by letting them customize their own virtual ride from a menu of drops, loops and other features. Universal Studios in Florida opened a roller coaster in August called the ""Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit,"" which lets people create their own personal musical soundtrack for their ride. Interactive rides are in the ""baby stages"" so far, since roller coasters and theme-park attractions are so expensive to build, but interaction and personalization promise to be running themes in the industry, said Bob McTyre, president of Apogee Attractions, which has has helped design rides for Disney, Universal Studios and others. McTyre was not involved in the new ride at Epcot. He said theme park designers frequently bring up ideas such as roller coasters with three possible endings, allowing riders to choose which path to take. But those big ideas quickly hit a roadblock: the high costs of implementing such a project, he said. Shawn McCoy, vice-president of marketing and business development at Jack Rouse Associates, another amusement-park design firm, said this desire for interactivity in amusement parks takes its cues from video games. ""There's also a definite need to compete with video games or the gaming industry -- where [players] have control over all of the elements, from the environment to the players' movement,"" he said, noting that museums and zoos also are taking notice of the trend. The ""Sum of All Thrills"" ride at Epcot employs a robotic arm -- more commonly seen assembling cars at an auto plant -- to let kids experience their roller coaster creations. Sitting in a carriage with their legs and arms outside the ride, kids watch a video version of their ride while the arm moves them from side to side and up and down to simulate the feeling of a real roller coaster. Fans blow air at the riders at various speeds to give people the sensation that they're moving forward. Goodman, the Disney designer, said the robotic arm and carriage come ""pretty darn close"" to replicating the real roller coaster experience. Kids design their experience on touch-screen computers, using a digital ruler and pre-selected track options to construct their rides. If a person tries to build something physically impossible -- a hill that's too steep for the cars to climb, for example -- then they're asked to retool their ideas. Disney hopes the interactive nature of the Epcot ride also helps kids learn that math and science can be fun. ""I think it's really empowering for the kids to realize that the math doesn't control them. They get to control the math,"" Goodman said. The Raytheon Company, a maker of weapons and defense systems, said it sponsored the exhibit as a way to get middle-school aged kids more interested in careers in math and engineering.","Disney opens an exhibit where kids create roller coasters -- and ride them .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Like other major financial centers such as London, Shanghai or New York, Hong Kong is home to legions of suited workers toiling long hours in vast, glass towers at breakneck speed. But in this crowded, materialistic city, there's a man trying to build a business from de-stressing the workplace. ""The wellness of employees is the wellness of the company; the very strength of a company is its employees,"" said Dario Calvaruso, a yoga instructor who set up Holistic Wellness -- a company that offers a series of in-office programs to reduce stress. He's on a mission to make yoga mats an essential fixture under every Hong Kong worker's desk. The 39-year old spent 15 years living in India studying the ancient discipline, which seeks to relax those who practice it, through elongation, slow movement and controlled breathing. Opportunity . When Calvaruso moved to Hong Kong in October 2011, opportunity knocked on his door. ""Many of my friends were major company managers and approached me for private (yoga) classes,"" Calvaruso said. ""After seeing its benefits they thought 'this should come to my company'."" Within this territory's constricted work spaces, practicing yoga requires relatively little room and minimal equipment -- a large ball and a mat are enough. As the instructor plays calm music, everyone stretches, breathes deeply and closes their eyes. ""All the team is present at the lessons and it's a great way to start our day,"" said Manuele Bosetti, general manager of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macao. This organization has to deal with the day-to-day problems of its member companies and sometimes taking the time to listen can be a challenge, Bosetti told CNN. But performing yoga as a group has helped. ""We noticed that everyone at the office was more relaxed, and we managed to treat our business partners in a more kind way,"" Bosetti added. Suited and ready . The sight of practitioners in their work clothes surrounded by computers and other electronics may seem incongruous with relaxation and meditation, but Calvaruso believes yoga performed in his studio is similar to that done in corporate environments -- although people in the workplace may face unique problems. For example, students at a studio yoga class may practice over many years, while those in corporate settings may be unfamiliar with the discipline. ""In an office, maybe people don't know anything about yoga,"" Calvaruso told CNN. ""They may feel discomfort, frozen shoulders; we try to release all the tension from the shoulders to give them proper alignment."" Desk ergonomics are another common focus for yoga classes in offices. And the result? ""Employees perform better, produce more, and of course, the company has bigger profits,"" Calvaruso said. Nevertheless, it can be difficult to inspire managers to interrupt their team's workday for a few minutes of relaxation. ""In Asia, (employee wellness) is still new, it's growing,"" said Calvaruso, who believes the region lags behind Europe and the United States when it comes to measures that actively help employees find a balance between work and leisure. This instructor's uphill battle goes against Asia's economic dynamism. An insatiable hunger for ever-larger returns and continuous growth is the new culture of this region, and it seems to have replaced much centuries-old wisdom that teaches spiritual development through balance, meditation and harmony with nature.","Dario Calvaruso, 39, teaches yoga classes in a different kind of studio -- the office .

"(CNN) -- It turns out sunscreen does more than protect you from cancer and painful sunburns -- it offers a boost to simple vanity. A new study finds that regular sunscreen use protects against photoaging: the wrinkling, spotting and loss of elasticity caused by exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation. While they may not be shocking, the findings -- from Australian researchers -- are the first to quantify sunscreen's anti-aging properties. More than 900 participants were followed for four years. Some were told to use sunscreen daily and instructed in proper use, including re-applying sunscreen after being outside for a few hours, after going in the water or after sweating heavily. Other participants were given no directions with regard to using sunscreen -- it was considered unethical to ask them to not use it. Skin changes were measured through a technique called microtopography, in which researchers made sensitive silicone impressions of the back of each participant's hand. Chronic sun exposure damages trucker's skin through glass . ""Skin surface patterns reflect the severity of the sun's damage to the deeper skin, especially to the elastic fibers and collagen,"" says Dr. Adele Green, the study's lead author. Damage was measured on a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 signifying no damage and 6 meaning skin with severe aging. Participants were given a score at the start of a four-year period and another score at the end; those who used sunscreen daily were 24% less likely to show increased signs of aging, researchers found. ""We now have the scientific evidence to back the long-held assumption about the cosmetic value of sunscreen,"" says Green. ""Regular sunscreen use by young and mid-aged adults under 55 brings cosmetic benefits and also decreases the risk of skin cancer."" The sun does damage with different types of radiation, according to Dr. Lawrence Gibson, a professor of dermatology at the Mayo Clinic. UV-B radiation is the primary cause of most skin cancers and is also the main cause of sunburns. Photoaging is mostly caused by UV-A radiation, which robs the skin of its natural ability to hold its shape and also causes freckles and so-called liver spots. ""Your skin tries to protect itself, and makes all this splotchy pigment,"" says Gibson. ""It's the body's response trying to protect itself from that bombardment."" What to look for when buying sunscreen . The new report, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, is part of a research project that has stretched for more than two decades, led by Green and colleagues at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. The measurements were taken between 1992 and 1996, and patients used older types of sunscreens. In theory, says Gibson, modern sunscreens should be even more effective. ""Back in the '90s, we didn't have many good UV-A sunscreens,"" he says. ""Now, we have broad-spectrum sunscreens that block both UV-A and UV-B rays, although none of them block all the UV-A."" Video: The best sunscreens aren't necessarily the most expensive . While sunscreens have improved, Gibson cautions that they are no replacement for limiting total exposure, and avoiding intense sun during the middle part of the day. He also notes that photoaging is not part of the natural aging process -- it's avoidable. ""If you see a 90-year-old person, and look at a part of their body that has not been exposed to the sun, you don't see any photoaging,"" he says. Anyone who spends time outdoors during daylight hours should use sunscreen, even if they have darker skin pigment and tan easily, the Mayo Clinic advises. Children are especially susceptible to the sun's harmful effects. Babies under the age of 6 months should be kept out of direct sunlight because their skin is so fragile. A word about SPF: It's not an indication of how much time you should spend in the sun. An SPF of 30 does not mean you can stay out twice as long as an SPF of 15, the clinic says. An SPF of 15 filters out about 93% of UV-B rays, compared to 97% for SPF 30. Last year, the Environmental Working Group said it had found 25% of 800 tested sunscreens were effective without containing harmful ingredients. To make the watchdog group's safe list, sunscreens had to be free of oxybenzone, retinyl palmitate (a type of vitamin A), not have an SPF above 50 and protect against UV-A and UV-B rays.","Photoaging is skin wrinkling, spotting and loss of elasticity caused by sun damage .

"(CNN) -- Ricky Dunigan, better known as Lord Infamous, a founding member of the Oscar-winning rap group Three 6 Mafia, died of a heart attack last week, according to a release from Black Rain Entertainment. Dunigan, 40, died Friday. ""Dunigan's family is grateful for all the condolences and prayers, and would like to request privacy in their time of grief,"" the statement said. Lord Infamous left the group in 2006, the year Three 6 Mafia surprisingly won an Academy Award for best original song with ""It's Hard Out Here For a Pimp,"" from the movie ""Hustle & Flow."" Billboard reported he was forced to leave, having spent time locked up. That year, Dunigan and Il Tone, a longtime friend, founded the music company Black Rain Entertainment, and Lord Infamous soon began a solo career. Earlier this year, he rejoined his old band mates to form Da Mafia 6ix, according to Rolling Stone magazine. One of his fellow rappers, DJ Paul, who was with him at his mother's house in Memphis, Tennessee, when Lord Infamous died, said, ""He was at home sitting at the table and he just lay his head down and he just left us."" The group was planning to release an album next March. ""Lord Infamous was the kind of person that never cared about having a lot of money or this or that,"" DJ Paul told Rolling Stone. ""He just liked to make music, he liked to rap, and he liked to make people happy."" Juicy J, another Three 6 Mafia member, thanked fans for their condolences on Twitter: ""Thx you for your prayers, I'm very hurt, can't believe it's true,"" he wrote to his 1.4 million followers.

"(CNN) -- Residents of a small Filipino village lined up flowers. Firefighters in Sydney, Australia, climbed stairs to the top of a skyscraper and shed tears. In Madrid, Spain, a crowd of several hundred gathered to plant trees and hold a moment of silence. Around the world on Sunday, people remembered 9/11, marking in their own ways the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that brought much of the world to a standstill. Jose Luis San Pio, who lost his daughter in the attacks, said the pain gets worse with each anniversary. ""But Sylvia is always in my memory,"" he said, during a ceremony at a Madrid park where 10 American Oak trees were planted. Sylvia San Pio Resta, 26, was the only Spaniard to die in the attacks. She was pregnant and worked in the Twin Towers, as did her American husband, John Resta, who also died. They were both financial traders. ""We are here to remember those who died on that day but also to celebrate their memory,"" said U.S. Ambassador to Spain Alan Solomont. The crowd observed a moment of silence for the 9/11 victims. In Sydney -- 10,000 miles from New York, where the World Trade Center towers were leveled in the attacks -- firefighters held their own moment of silence for their lost brethren. They climbed 80 flights of stairs to the top of Sydney Tower, the city's tallest building, in a testament to the firefighters in New York who rushed into the burning towers. ""This is the least we could do just to say thank you,"" said one. ""So many of them didn't go home that day,"" said another. CNN affiliate 9 News reported on a moment of silence the firefighters held at the top -- and showed one young firefighter weeping. Later, at an interfaith memorial service in Sydney's St. Mary's Cathedral, Cardinal George Pell, Sydney's archbishop, said, ""While belonging to different religious traditions, we're united in our opposition to terrorism."" In some parts of the world, people found quiet ways to mark the solemn occasion and pay their respects. Residents of the Gawad Kalinga village in Baseco Compound in Manila, Philippines, brought flowers to a marker in memory of Marie Rose Abad, who was killed in the attacks. Her husband Rudy, a Filipino-American, had donated funds for the construction of 48 homes in their village as a tribute to their 26 years of marriage, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported Sunday. In front of the U.S. Embassy in London's Grosvenor Square, dignitaries joined loved ones of 67 Britons who died in the attacks -- the most from any country outside the United States. The memorial stands at the far end of a quiet park directly across from the embassy. There, visitors can find the names of the victims: a set of wooden pillars also stands, carved with the words ""Grief is the price we pay for love."" ""Although that dreadful act of violence was meant to divide us, it has actually drawn us together, one person to another, one community to another"" Prince Charles told an audience including Prime Minister David Cameron. ""On this anniversary we are drawn to you in our thoughts and in our prayers, knowing that we cannot change the past, but that through struggling to find a light that can lighten our darkness, we may ultimately bring the healing the world so desperately needs."" Family members stepped up to read the names of their lost loved ones, then placed long-stem white roses attached to small black-and-white photos of the victims on a 9/11 memorial garden. Police kept two competing protests away from the ceremony -- and each other. Radical Islamic group Muslims Against Crusades, chanted ""USA you will pay!"" while the far-right, anti-Islamic organization English Defence League turned up to counter that demonstration. In Ancona, Italy, Pope Benedict XVI offered a prayer in memory of the victims. Saying he was thinking of those who lost their lives and the victims' families, the pontiff said, ""I invite the leaders of nations and men of good will to reject violence always as a solution to problems, to resist the temptation to hate and to work within society based on the principles of solidarity, justice and peace."" Paris held a moving ceremony at the Place du Trocadero, also known as Human Rights Plaza. Two replica towers about 80 feet tall, representing the World Trade Center, were erected, covered with large canvasses displaying the names of the victims of each tower. About 200 people gathered for the ceremony, despite the windy, rainy weather. A French mother, who brought her 2-year-old daughter, said she felt the need to be there to support the United States. She recalled the front page of the French newspaper Le Monde at the time of the attacks, which carried the headline, ""We are all Americans."" The event ended with the flight of 40 doves released by children. Among those commemorating 9/11 on Sunday were U.S. troops stationed overseas, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. Members of Joint Base Balad, Iraq, took part in a 24-hour flag run/walk vigil combined with a remembrance ceremony, the U.S. military said. ""I'm from New York, so I remember 9/11 like yesterday, I responded to the towers, so New York City is embedded in me,"" said Master Sgt. George Pardee, 332nd Expeditionary Logistics Readiness Squadron Vehicle Maintenance flight. At U.S. bases in Afghanistan, where soldiers are fighting a war triggered by the 9/11 attacks, soldiers took part in ceremonies to reflect as well. ""Don't forget what happened on that day, and remember the reason why we fight,"" said Air Force Master Sgt. Alex Kruhlinski, a radio frequency transmission systems specialist in Kapisa Province. In countries all over the world, many people stopped what they were doing Sunday to watch the 9/11 memorials on TV -- and to share memories on social media. David Bennett was in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, watching the ceremonies on CNN with friends. He told CNN via Facebook that he was ""thinking about the loss and where I was when I first heard about what was happening that morning."" ""Being a Muslim convert, one who chooses to wear the headscarf, even here in rural Ontario, Canada, I'm choosing to stay home today and reflect on this day and how the world changed,"" Alice Paisley-Ellis told CNN via Facebook. She also said there are people who ""believe all Muslims were responsible for this, and I choose not to put myself in their path today."" Jacob Meitus said he was in Israel, taking part in a moment of silence. ""We are thinking of American brothers-in-arms and all those who lost love ones. Long live freedom!"" Petra Nelson, a former New Yorker, was in Sweden, thinking of the Big Apple. ""I've never been back to NYC since 9/11,"" she told CNN, ""and I miss it every day.""

"New York (CNN) -- Jason Brezler is an elite New York firefighter. He is also a highly decorated officer in the U.S. Marine Corps Forces Reserve, who has served four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. So why is Maj. Brezler facing possible discharge on less than honorable terms after serving 13 years with the Marines? He is accused of mishandling classified information and faces an investigation that could determine his future. ""For a man like Jason Brezler, being asked to separate from the Marine Corps that he loved so much would be an even worse punishment than jail,"" said Kevin Carroll, Brezler's attorney, a former CIA officer who is providing Brezler pro bono representation along with his law firm Quinn, Emanuel, Urquhart & Sullivan. In an e-mail to CNN, Marine Col. Francis Piccoli wrote that because of ""the mishandling of classified information, Maj. Brezler has been ordered to show cause of retention in the U.S. Marine Corps before a Board of Inquiry."" That board will consist of three officers: one colonel and two lieutenant colonels. Brezler, a tall man with a strong New York accent and a blond buzz-cut, is legally barred from speaking about his case. But influential supporters are leaping to the 32-year-old veteran's defense. A congressman, a senator and two Marine Corps generals have written letters on Brezler's behalf. None of his defenders dispute the fact that Brezler broke security protocol when he sent classified information over an insecure line in summer 2012. In fact, his attorney said Brezler quickly reported the mistake to his superiors. His defenders argue the urgency of the situation warranted the security breach. ""Maj. Brezler was in a position where lives were in danger and time was of the essence, and in the end his assessment of the threat proved accurate,"" wrote New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand in a letter to the Marines. During summer 2012, Brezler was attending graduate courses in Oklahoma when he received an e-mail from Marine officers in Afghanistan's Helmand province, a deeply troubled area where Brezler had been deployed in 2009-2010. ""The subject line of the e-mail he received said in all capital letters with three exclamation marks 'IMPORTANT: SARWAR JAN IS BACK,'"" said Carroll. Brezler had history with Jan, an Afghan police commander who had been active in Helmand province. ""When Jason was serving in Afghanistan in 2010, he caused Sarwar Jan, a police official, to be fired from that position because he was raping children,"" Carroll said. Despite repeated efforts by CNN's bureau in Kabul, Jan could not be found to comment for this report. Carroll said ""within minutes"" Brezler wrote his colleagues back at Forward Operating Base Delhi in Afghanistan, with a warning about Jan. He attached to the e-mail a classified document that included allegations about Jan, claiming he had ties to the Taliban. ""Jason immediately responded with everything he knew, including some extraordinarily derogatory information he knew about this man indicating that he was a threat not only to local children but to Marines,"" Carroll said. ""When the Marines in Afghanistan wrote back saying that some of that information might have been classified, (Brezler) immediately turned himself in."" In retrospect, some observers believe this was a breach of security that could have saved lives. On August 10, 2012, less than two weeks after Brezler's warning, three Marines were shot to death in the gym at FOB Delhi. Their names were Staff Sgt. Scott Dickinson, Cpl. Richard Rivera and Lance Cpl. Gregory Buckley. The suspected gunman was a teenage servant, known by the single Afghan name Aynoddin, who was working on the base for Jan. Despite his earlier dismissal, Jan had been appointed to command the Afghan police in another district of Helmand Province, where FOB Delhi was located. More than a year later, Buckley's home in Oceanside, New York, is decorated with American flags and photos in honor of the slain 21-year old. Asked what would have happened if commanders at FOB Delhi heeded Brezler's warning, Greg Buckley Sr. paused, his eyes filling with tears. ""I would have my son,"" he said. ""I would have my boy with me today."" Before the shooting, Buckley Sr. said that his son had warned him over the phone about the Afghan police commander named Jan. ""He told me that (Jan) was a bad person,"" the elder Buckley said. ""They all knew that he was a bad guy. He was thrown out of two other bases prior to this for drug laundering, prostitution and ties to the Taliban,"" he said. In the aftermath of the shooting, Jan was detained by Afghan security forces, according to an August 2012 report in The Washington Post. Despite repeated requests for information, Afghan officials both in the Helmand provincial government and in the Interior Ministry of the national government in Kabul told CNN they had no information about either Jan or Aynoddin's current whereabouts. Meanwhile, more than 14 months after the deadly shooting, American investigators have yet to publish the results of their inquiry. ""The case is still open, pending prosecution by the Afghanis,"" wrote Ed Buice, a spokesman for Naval Criminal Investigative Service, in an e-mail to CNN. Military experts and government officials are questioning why it has taken so long to release a report. ""Generally, investigations are conducted a lot more quickly,"" said Rep. Peter King, a Republican from New York. Last month, King sent a letter to the Department of Defense asking investigators to answer several questions, including: . -- Did Sarwar Jan commit sex crimes against juveniles while on U.S. Defense Department facilities? -- Did Jan use U.S. government funds to procure his victims? -- Why was Jan reportedly dismissed as district police chief? Why was he reappointed? Instead of getting answers, King said he saw action being taken against Brezler. ""The only person who's being penalized, or potentially punished, is the person who tried to warn the Marines,"" the congressman said. ""I cannot possibly understand it."" Brezler's case has been taken up by the Marine Corps Times, the newspaper that first broke the story of the major's legal troubles. ""Brezler's treatment sends the messages that in the Marine Corps there's no room for honest mistakes,"" the Times wrote in a recent editorial. ""He's the sort of officer the Corps needs more of,"" it read. Buckley Sr, father of the slain Marine, agrees: ""They should be giving him a medal, not prosecuting him."" The Marine Corps declined to comment further on Brezler's case. Piccoli said the silence was vital to avoid influencing the officers the major is expected to face at his board of inquiry next month. The hearing, which could take a few hours or a few days depending on the number of witnesses called, will end with an immediate recommendation by the board. Depending on the evidence presented, there are several options open to the board. The three officers could recommend either an honorable discharge or a less-than-honorable discharge. The latter could result in a loss of veteran's benefits, including free health care. The Secretary of the Navy would need to give a final stamp of approval on that decision. If the board recommends no action against Brezler, the decision is final.","Jason Brezler faces possible discharge on less than honorable terms .

"(CNN) -- How annoying and frustrating have calls from telemarketers, and robocalls pitching useless and sometimes fraudulent services, become? How much daily irritation in millions of American households have the endless calls been causing? Enough that the federal government, this month, offered a $50,000 cash reward to the citizen who comes up with the best technical solution for blocking illegal commercial robocalls on landlines and mobile phones. Seriously. In announcing the reward, David Vladeck, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that the person who devises a way to get rid of the calls ""will become a national hero."" The robocalls, aggressively attempting to sell unasked-for products and services to people who are quietly sitting around their homes, are like cockroaches: irritating, despised, always multiplying, seemingly indestructible and undefeatable. Not that no one is trying. According to the FTC, ""During the last two years the FTC has stopped companies responsible for billions of robocalls that offered everything from fraudulent credit card services and so-called auto warranty protection to grant procurement programs. But the number of robocall complaints continues to rise as new technologies enable telemarketers to auto-dial thousands of phone calls every minute that display false or misleading caller ID information for an incredibly low cost."" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, in proposing legislation that would dramatically increase the penalties for making harassing telemarketing calls to people's homes, has said: ""A family has the right to get through dinner without constantly being interrupted by phone calls from mortgage companies, credit card firms or, even worse, scammers."" Schumer has proposed fining telemarketers $20,000 each time a call is made to a phone number whose owner has registered it with a do-not-call list. (Telemarketing calls and robocalls to landlines on behalf of political candidates, by the way, are permitted under federal regulations; some states have passed their own laws in an effort to restrict those political calls.) The federal Do Not Call Registry, which was instituted in 2003, has, on paper, been a remarkable success. According to the FTC, more than 217 million telephone numbers are on the registry. But complaints about unwanted marketing calls continue to go up. Last year, more than 3.8 million people filed formal complaints about receiving telemarketing calls and commercial robocalls. I spoke with the FTC's point person on robocalls and harassing telemarketing calls: Lois Greisman, the director of the agency's Division of Marketing Practices in the Bureau of Consumer Protection. She said the robocalls, including ones initiated by criminal scammers, are proliferating because ""it's becoming cheaper and cheaper to do this (automated) voice blasting."" The reason that families who have listed their telephone numbers with the Do Not Call Registry continue to receive the marketing calls, she said, is that ""the people sending out the calls are acting illegally, and they have no intention of complying with the law."" She made a distinction between legitimate companies who do telephone marketing and heed the Do Not Call Registry, and firms that do not: ""Fraudulent telemarketers never were going to comply."" (This raises the question of why it should be up to individuals and families to register on a do-not-call list: Is there anyone in this country who actually enjoys hearing from strangers on the telephone trying to sell them things? Who eagerly awaits unsolicited calls seeking money and personal information?) Greisman said that ""enormous law-enforcement focus"" is being given to the fraudulent telemarketers. I asked her if there really were enough people answering their phones and giving money to the robocall companies to make it worth the telemarketers' efforts: Do these companies make significant profits? ""They wouldn't be doing it if they didn't,"" she said. ""They aren't in the business of charity."" She said that the cockroach analogy didn't go far enough: ""This isn't just a nuisance. This is economic injury to the people being duped."" I asked her if she -- the federal official who spends her days working against the robocallers -- receives the calls at her own home. ""Yes,"" she said. And, she said, not only at her home: She receives them on her government-issued cell phone. Which raises an intriguing, if unlikely, scenario: . Maybe if the seemingly unstoppable robocalls somehow made it through to a residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, the annoyance and anger that accompany them might be what it would take to finally start the demise of the scam callers. Remember that political ad of Hillary Clinton's, about a phone ringing in the White House at 3 a.m.? What if the president were to pick up that ringing telephone in the middle of the night, and be greeted by an automated voice asking him if he'd like to lower his mortgage rates? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Telemarketers, robocalls so irritating that FTC has offered cash for solution .

"(CNN) -- The secretive British artist Banksy, not content with the immense publicity already generated by his recent decision to create graffiti and other art installations around New York City each day for a month, may have finally worn out his welcome. In a crude, obscene bid for attention, Banksy published a rant on Sunday against One World Trade Center, calling it a ""shy skyscraper"" that ""so clearly proclaims the terrorists have won."" INTERACTIVE: Explore Banksy in New York . ""You currently have under construction a one thousand foot tall sign that reads, 'New York -- we lost our nerve,'"" he wrote. ""One World Trade Center declares the glory days of New York are gone."" New Yorkers, who are still recovering from the billions of dollars and thousands of lives lost at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, reacted with understandable outrage. ""TOWERING INSULT"" screamed the front-page headline of the New York Daily News, proclaiming that Banksy ""spits on graves of 9/11 victims."" New York is a city long accustomed to attention-seeking huckster-artists who push -- and exceed -- the limits of decency and good taste. But even in a town that gave the world Warhol, Madonna, Diddy and Lady Gaga, the Banksy screed against the World Trade Center site was a bit much to bear. Banksy, who perhaps imagines he's bringing a fresh, avant-garde perspective to the issue, is actually joining the conversation about a decade too late. Back when the World Trade Center was still a smoking, twisted pile of debris, all sorts of New Yorkers -- from planners and artists to financiers, politicians and everyday citizens -- had begun a vast, anguished debate over what, if anything, should be built on the 16 acres where so many perished. Countless planning meetings were held, involving arts groups, real estate professionals, engineers and political leaders. A string of group brainstorming sessions (called charrettes) was convened, where different ideas were sketched out and turned into models. Artists and architects were invited to dream up something new, and nine different designs emerged. I was one of the planners behind an extraordinary two-day public planning session, called Listening to the City, in which thousands of New Yorkers gathered at a convention center and spent hours discussing and electronically voting on the different visions, and talking about the principles that should govern the rebuilding. Groups of total strangers sat and asked one another key questions. How much space should be devoted to commerce? How large should the memorial be? Should the site be returned to its original use as an office tower, or turned into a Gettysburg-type urban meadow (the use suggested by ex-Mayor Rudy Giuliani)? At the time, there was a serious question about whether any large companies would choose to relocate in a place that had twice been attacked by terrorists. And along the way, we tackled the very issue Banksy is now whining about: What effect will the new building have on the city skyline? New Yorkers also debated whether to create a memorial near, beneath or alongside a new building. In the end, we opened the memorial design to the entire world, resulting in more than 5,000 entries, constituting the largest design competition in history. One wonders if Banksy bothered to send in a sketch. The matter was largely resolved the way big public questions are supposed to get settled in a democracy: through a chain of public and private conflicts and compromises that generated a final product reflecting many visions. Like many iconic buildings in New York, One World Trade Center is a place of commerce, continuing a tradition that created the New York skyline -- from the Woolworth Building (the first skyscraper) to the Chrysler Building, Citicorp Center and the original World Trade Center itself. The men who designed and built these and many other bold cathedrals of capitalism were trying to make money, not art. Larry Silverstein, the developer of the World Trade Center, received a multi-billion-dollar insurance payment for the destroyed building, under terms that included a requirement that he rebuild and lease an equivalent amount of commercial space. And after the loss of 3,000 people in one of the worst atrocities ever committed on American soil, the issue of security was seared into the thinking of the public and private authorities involved in rebuilding the site. New Yorkers fought, fussed and financed for years. ""104 floors of compromise?"" asks Banksy. Well, yes. The basic proposition of America -- the Latin motto printed on our currency -- is ""e pluribus unum"": out of many, one. The new building, and the process that led to its creation, is quintessentially American, right to the peak of its spire, specifically designed to soar exactly 1,776 feet in the air, a nod to the year we broke from British domination in the founding act of American audacity. Banksy, a British citizen, seems to have missed or misunderstood the symbolism, and much else, in his short time in New York. Needless to say, the democratically generated blend of culture and commerce at the World Trade Center site -- which draws millions of visitors, dwarfing any audience Banksy is likely to have -- will stand as a monument to our values and drive long after sarcastic visiting artists have moved on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Errol Louis.","Errol Louis: Street artist Banksy published rant slamming One World Trade Center .

"(CNN) -- Convicted kidnapper Ariel Castro killed himself, the Ohio medical examiner who conducted his autopsy says, disputing assertions that the convicted kidnapper and rapist may have died accidentally. Coroner Jan Gorniak had harsh words for Ohio corrections officials for raising the possibility in a report Thursday that Castro's death may have been the accidental result of auto-erotic asphyxiation. That involves depriving the brain of oxygen by controlled strangulation to intensify a sexual experience. ""I did the autopsy myself. I saw the ligature. I saw the pictures of the cell,"" she said. ""It was a suicide."" The state report released Thursday, meanwhile, also found that prison guards falsified logs and did not check on Castro as often as they should have. They appeared to have also falsified ""the post log book for their rounds,"" according to the report, from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. The guards were placed on leave as authorities looked into Castro's death. Investigators have not decided on whether to take any disciplinary action. As for the report's mention of the possibility that Castro's death was accidental, the coroner said no one involved in the report consulted her -- and she's not happy about that. ""They were outside of their lane ... I don't think anyone else should have an opinion on what the cause of death was,"" Gorniak said. In its report, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction noted that Casto's body was found hanging from a sheet wrapped around his neck and tied to a hinge in the window of his cell. ""His pants and underwear were pulled down to his ankles,"" the report said. ""The relevance of this finding is unclear. These facts, however, were relayed to the Ohio State Highway Patrol for consideration of the possibility of auto-erotic asphyxiation."" Gorniak said she was not made aware that Castro was found with his pants down in the jail cell, but that does not change the cause of death. There were no signs that he was sexually stimulated, she said. And his pants may have slipped off while he was hanging, she said. He left no suicide note, the report said, but not everyone who commits suicide does, the coroner said. Ariel Castro's son describes personal torment after father's crimes . Castro was imprisoned for more than 1,000 years for kidnapping and raping three women who he held in captive in his Cleveland home for years. He was found dead in his jail cell on September 3. Meanwhile, the report released Thursday also said that two prison guards responsible for checking on Castro ""did not timely perform"" required rounds.","Coroner who performed Castro's autopsy says Castro killed himself .

"(CNN) -- Got a smartphone? Never lose your hotel key, or even have to stop at the registration desk, again. That's the vision of a hotel chain that plans to send digital keys to guests' phones via an app instead of making them check in and get the traditional (and famously lose-able) plastic swipe cards. Arriving guests could bypass the front desk and go straight to their rooms. Starwood Hotels & Resorts, which owns more than 1,150 hotels in nearly 100 countries, plans to debut the system in the next three months at two of its Aloft hotels -- in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City and Cupertino, California. Cupertino is likely no accident -- being, of course, the home of Apple's headquarters. If all goes well, the company says it could have the feature in all of its hotels by next year. A spokeswoman said the app will initially be compatible with recent iPhone models (4S and newer) and newer Android phones. The app will use Bluetooth technology to unlock the room with a tap. ""We believe this will become the new standard for how people will want to enter a hotel,"" Frits van Paasschen, Starwood's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal. ""It may be a novelty at first, but we think it will become table stakes for managing a hotel."" Starwood, a chain that's heavy on boutique hotels, has a history of tech innovation and employs its own digital team. Just last year, the company launched a plan to develop solar power at its hotels, offered discounts during a ""Cyber Monday"" sale and premiered an iPad-specific mobile app. Starwood also announced Instagram integration on its websites, which lets visitors see images that guests have posted.","A hotel chain is testing an app that sends virtual room keys to your phone .

"(CNN) -- Since the first Harry Potter book came out in 1999, trends in young adult fiction have shifted from wizards to glittering vampires, followed by bloodthirsty ""Hunger Games"" and, now, teens coping with terminal illnesses and realistic issues. These trends influence which books publishers market toward teens. Will the success of novels like John Green's ""The Fault in Our Stars"" flood next year's market with realistic contemporary plots? It's a question that publishers and authors tackled recently during Publisher's Weekly's online panel discussion ""It's Not Easy Being Green or a Teen: Reality Bites in YA Lit."" They found that while writers like J.K. Rowling and Green have opened the doors for authors and stories in their respective genres, young adult fiction should never be driven in just one direction. The nature of trends is cyclical rather than disappearing, said Michelle Bayuk of Egmont Publishing. This week, Teen Read Week, young readers will have a chance to speak for themselves and vote for their favorite books on the Young Adult Library Services Association website. Readers between the ages of 12 and 18 can nominate and vote for their favorite titles from the past year via the Teens' Top Ten list. 40 new titles to feed your YA book addiction . We spoke with a few young adult fiction experts for a trend outlook going into 2015. The 'John Green effect' Contemporary stories with heavier topics and ""illness books"" are on the rise, according to Elissa Petruzzi, website editor of RT Book Reviews. ""From mental illness to cancer, books are tackling issues that affect some teens every day,"" she said. Examples include Laurie Halse Anderson's ""The Impossible Knife of Memory,"" Wendy Wunder's ""The Probability of Miracles"" and AJ Betts' ""Zac and Mia."" Cindy Pon of Diversity in YA has also found the trend in more diverse offerings, like Jenny Han's ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"" and Meg Medina's ""Yaqui Delgado Wants to Kick Your Ass."" ""Both had funny light moments but also real and thought-provoking scenes with wonderfully drawn characters,"" Pon said. ""I've also enjoyed great thrillers like Lamar Giles' 'Fake ID' and Morris Award-winning author Stephanie Kuehn's sophomore novel, 'Complicit.' "" Subgenres shine . Although paranormal and dystopian titles are still being read and published, other subgenres like mystery and horror are on the rise in the wake of these popular trends, according to Young Adult Library Services Association President Chris Shoemaker. ""It's nice to see a horror renaissance that isn't focused solely on zombies,"" he said. ""Fantasy is still going strong, and with the success of Sarah J. Maas's 'Throne of Glass' series and the highly buzzed 'Snow Like Ashes' by Sara Raasch, I'm sure we'll see even more fantasy novels next year,"" said DJ DeSmyter, assistant Web editor at RT Book Reviews. New Adult . ""The big trend near this age group continues to be New Adult, with much more sexy, adult story lines,"" Petruzzi said. These titles often include characters that are entering or already in college. Books by authors like Abbi Glines, Cora Carmack, Colleen Hoover and Jennifer Armentrout have proved to be a big hit with readers, and the genre is expanding to include more than just contemporary love stories. Love, bullying and friendship . Much of young adult fiction is issue-driven, telling relatable stories of how to face the everyday struggles of being a teen. Bullying remains a popular topic, with stories like ""Tease"" by Amanda Maciel being told from the viewpoint of the bully herself, according to Petruzzi. In the place of complicated love triangles or predictable couples, stories about platonic friendships between quirky teens who don't fall in love are on the rise, Shoemaker said. ""There's also been a slight increase in novels dealing with teen sexuality, which I think -- and hope -- will carry over into 2015 and beyond,"" DeSmyter said. Diversity . According to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the number of ""children of mixed race grew at a faster rate than any other group over the past decade,"" increasing by 46% from 2000 to 2010. The book market doesn't currently match those budding readers with enough diverse offerings, Shoemaker said. But there is a movement for change. Pon and Petruzzi were both excited to see diverse titles like Una LaMarche's ""Like No Other,"" Amanda Sun's ""Rain,"" Laura Lam's ""Pantomime"" and Marie Lu's ""The Young Elites"" this year. ""I've seen real momentum in the awareness and desire for more inclusive and diverse narratives, culminating in the amazing #weneeddiversebooks Twitter campaign that went viral,"" Pon said. The ""We Need Diverse Books"" team has taken up initiatives outside of Twitter to bring diverse books into classrooms and organize the first Children's Literature Diversity Festival for 2016, Pon pointed out. But she also believes that traditional publishing still has a long way to go. ""I would love to see more books dealing with mental health conditions, other disabilities and the underrepresented individuals of the LGBTQI spectrum,"" DeSmyter said. ""Better yet, I'd love to see books feature these topics without making them the sole focus. A diverse book shouldn't be a 'Diverse Book'; it should just be another great novel that teens devour in hours and love for the rest of their lives.""","""The Fault in Our Stars"" likely to bring uptick in contemporary young adult fiction .
Mystery and horror stories are on the rise for teens .
There is momentum for diversity in young adult lit but a long way to go, experts say ."
"(CNN) -- When Elizabeth Joice found out that she was pregnant, she and her husband, Max, were ecstatic. A fertility specialist had told her that this would never happen, Max says, because of the chemotherapy Elizabeth underwent to beat sarcoma in 2010. ""It very much felt like a miracle,"" he says. ""Bringing a child into this world -- I mean, it wasn't just important for me; it was one of the most important things for Liz."" Then, one month into her pregnancy, Elizabeth's cancer returned, he says. Surgeons removed the tumors in her back, but she needed a full-body MRI scan to know whether the cancer had spread. Because an MRI's contrast dyes may damage a developing fetus, she faced a difficult decision. She could either terminate her pregnancy to undergo the scan or continue with the pregnancy without knowing her true cancer status. ""We felt that if we terminated this pregnancy and did these scans, if it turned out that there was no evidence of this disease after the scans, then we would have possibly given up our only chance at having a child naturally and would have done it for nothing,"" Max said. ""It was a calculated risk. We knew there was a possibility of a worst-case scenario, but we also thought there was a good chance that we could have the baby."" Shortly after becoming pregnant, Elizabeth was introduced to filmmaker Christopher Henze. His upcoming documentary on pregnancy and motherhood will include the Joices' story. ""It took about three minutes to realize that Liz was a stellar human being, and I wanted her for my movie,"" Henze said. ""I was impressed by the way she looked at cancer as another problem to be solved."" Even though a shielded chest X-ray taken in November found no sign of cancer, by January, she was having trouble breathing. Another X-ray revealed tumors in her lungs. Her C-section date was moved up, and on January 23 -- six weeks early -- Lily Joice was born. ""It was incredibly difficult to want to enjoy this amazing moment as much as you possibly can,"" Max said. ""Yet to know that you're facing something so incredibly dire, and the chances didn't look good at that point."" After delivery, doctors found cancer in Elizabeth's heart, abdomen and pelvis. She died in the hospital on March 9. She was 36. ""In the face of this life-threatening illness,"" her husband said, ""she was so optimistic and so strong and so willing to go through whatever fight she would have to go through in order to have this baby."" Henze delivered a eulogy at Elizabeth's funeral. ""Lots of people say 'Liz was'; I say 'Liz is,' "" Henze said. ""Through her spirit and grace, she is still affecting people, and she will through the movie, will continue to impact people. Liz is.""

"(CNN) -- Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy has won praise for his government's effort to bring about a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, a delicate balancing act for the country's nation's first freely elected leader. Egypt has been the go-between in many previous Israeli-Palestinian disputes. But while longtime Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak was hostile to Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that rules Gaza, Morsy's Muslim Brotherhood is the group's political cousin. And although Morsy leads a population with deep historical sympathy for the Palestinians, he has pledged to maintain Egypt's peace treaty with Israel. ""He has clearly recognized Egypt's national interest here, and hopefully this can succeed and take hold,"" said George Mitchell, the former U.S. Senate majority leader and Obama administration Middle East envoy. The truce was announced Wednesday evening in Cairo after eight days of fighting, and it appeared to be holding in its early hours. Under Mubarak, the country's security forces had suppressed its own Islamists in the Muslim Brotherhood, even jailing Morsy at one point. After eight days of violence and 150 deaths, a cease-fire . That has given Morsy and his government influence with Hamas that Mubarak, a product of Egypt's military establishment, never had, said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations and Middle East analyst at the London School of Economics. ""Hamas listens to Mohamed Morsy,"" Gerges told CNN as the talks were still going on. ""Hamas looks up to Egypt now, at this particular stage, and that is why Egypt has emerged as the most important state vis-a-vis Hamas and Gaza."" Egypt's role in the talks was ""pivotal,"" he said. Morsy has used his intelligence chief, Mohammed Shehata, to spearhead separate talks between Israel and Hamas. Shehata played a major role in the release of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas for more than five years, and has good contacts with Israeli intelligence officials. Opinion: Real peace coming from this cease-fire? Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN that the deal announced Wednesday ""offers a future where we can have peace and quiet in the south. That's good for Israelis; it's also good for Gazans."" And the exiled political leader of Hamas, Khaled Meshaal, told reporters after the agreement that Egypt ""behaved responsibly."" ""Egypt did not sell out the resistance,"" Meshaal said. Morsy took office at the end of June, nearly a year and a half after the revolt that toppled Mubarak. The U.S.-educated engineer quickly rattled Western nerves by announcing he would work to free Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, now serving a life sentence in the United States in a conspiracy case related to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; and by attending the August summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Iran, the first visit by an Egyptian leader since the Islamic revolution in 1979. But he also took a swing at Iran's ally Syria during that conference, calling the embattled government of President Bashar al-Assad ""an oppressive regime that has lost its legitimacy"" and calling for support for opposition groups trying to overthrow him. Opinion: How this could be the last Gaza war . When sniping across the border separating Gaza from Israel erupted into open warfare last week, Morsy put the blame squarely on Israel. Egypt recalled its ambassador to Israel. Morsy also called the Israeli bombardment of the territory ""a blatant aggression against humanity"" and dispatched his prime minister, Hesham Kandil, to Gaza for talks with Palestinian officials, a step Mubarak would have been unlikely to take. That put Egypt at odds with the United States, which contributes about $1.3 billion in military and economic aid to Cairo every year. U.S. and several European leaders have put most of the blame for the current crisis on Hamas, saying Israel has a right to protect itself from rockets fired by Palestinian militants. Egypt needs Western support to help revive its economy, which went into a tailspin when the uprising against Mubarak broke out in January 2011. And its 1979 Camp David accords with Israel remain the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the turbulent region. Obama's telephone diplomacy . Morsy faces pressure from the Egyptian public to take a tougher line against Israel. An April 2011 poll by the Pew Global Research Project found that 54% of Egyptians want to abandon the Egypt-Israel peace treaty, while 36% want to keep it in place. When the latest fighting erupted between Hamas and Israel, Egyptian Cabinet chief Mohamed Refa'a al-Tahtawi said Egypt would continue to observe that pact. But he added, ""Respecting a peace treaty does not mean to stay idle or indifferent to what is going on along our borders."" The Egyptian government this week allowed some victims of the fighting in Gaza to enter through the Rafah crossing into Egypt, as well as the elderly and children. Though the Rafah crossing still has restricted access, a policy continued from Mubarak's rule, that access has been tightened or loosened since Morsy took office, depending on the local security conditions. This week, the Egyptian government allowed more than 500 Egyptians to cross into Gaza in a show of solidarity with the Palestinians, waving Palestinian flags and chanting, ""Israel is the enemy."" Rami Shaath, who helped organize the effort, told CNN, ""We just broke the siege."" Violence flares in Cairo . But that border is also a sign of a deteriorating security situation within Egypt, where much of Mubarak's feared apparatus has been dismantled since his ouster. More than 500 top officers of Mubarak's State Security Investigations have retired or been sacked, and militant groups have found space in places such as the sparsely populated Sinai Peninsula, where they have received shipments of weapons from Libya and elsewhere. In one attack on a military outpost in Sinai in July, militant Islamists killed 16 Egyptian soldiers. Morsy's government responded with a campaign aimed at driving them out of the region, accompanied by the firing of the region's governor, military police chief and intelligence director. Always an undergoverned area with scant respect for the state, Sinai is dominated by Bedouin tribes who are also accomplished smugglers. Nevertheless, Mitchell said Morsy's government ""has invested a lot of effort and in a sense prestige in this. So I think they will be trying very hard to make certain this that this cease-fire does hold, at least for a sufficient period of time so that the parties can discuss the broader issues."" ""I think it will only redound to his benefit, both domestically and around the world,"" Mitchell added. ""But in the end, his success or failure will rest upon how well the people of Egypt feel their interests have been met in terms of the need for jobs, for education -- the same things that people want everywhere in the world."" CNN's Matt Smith and Tim Lister in Atlanta and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy in Cairo contributed to this report.","NEW: Mohamed Morsy ""clearly recognized Egypt's national interest,"" George Mitchell says .

"(CNN) -- Ariel Adams loves watches. He owns more than a hundred of them, sometimes changing into a different watch multiple times a day. He has even turned his horological passion into a full-time job reviewing watches. Naturally, he is very excited for Apple's latest invention. ""As soon as the Apple Watch is available I will be adding it into my life, but in addition to mechanical watches,"" said Adams. ""I will more than likely have to wear one on each wrist."" Unfortunately for Apple, most people will only wear one watch. The question is, will they choose the Apple Watch over a classic timepiece? After three years of development, Apple finally gave the world a look at its new smartwatch on Tuesday. It won't be available until early next year, but the design is final. Whatever the reviews, it's guaranteed that Apple fans will camp out in line for one, and early-adopters and watch lovers like Adams will gladly drop $349 to slip it on. But to succeed, the Apple Watch will also have to appeal to regular people as a fashion accessory. The company has hired and collaborated with big names from the fashion industry, including watch designers like Marc Newson, Burberry's Angela Ahrendts and Yves Saint Laurent's Paul Deneve. Those fashion bona fides will help Apple's watch appeal to people who see the item as a fashion statement. Related: Apple just got its mojo back . Traditional watches are big business. Last year, watches were an $8.3 billion industry in the U.S., according to Euromonitor. Most watches sold are sub-$150 quartz watches, but $1,000 and up luxury mechanical watches from brands like Rolex, Omega and Louis Vuitton have been surging in popularity. ""Watches, unlike other consumer electronics, have existed for hundreds of years as accessories and fashion pieces,"" said Tim Barrett, a research analyst at Euromonitor. The smartwatch industry is a relative newborn. Only 750,000 smartwatches were sold in the U.S. in 2013, compared to 123 million smartphones and 32 million regular watches, according Barrett. So far, the most popular smartwatch is the Pebble, which got its start on Kickstarter. Smartwatches from companies like Samsung, Sony and LG have been plagued by clunky, large screens and glitchy software. ""Apple is definitely in the business of making markets as opposed to breaking into them, and this market has yet to be made,"" said Barrett. Related: 'Apple Pay' may be safer than plastic . The heart of the Apple Watch is a square touchscreen with rounded corners that comes in different metal finishes, including 18 carat gold. The watch face fits on classic watch straps that come in a range of styles, from sporty and colorful to high-end leather with metal clasps. The face of the watch is customizable and can display the time in a number of analog or digital designs. The final product is a typically Apple design: clean with a kick of personality. ""I don't think it will replace the traditional timepiece, but I do think it is the most aesthetically pleasing wearable that has come to market to date,"" said Eugene Tong, style director at Details magazine. ""I would wear it, but probably not every day."" Apple has smartly included styles and a smaller watch face size to appeal specifically to women, a group mostly shut out by the gigantic smartwatch screens already on the market. ""Right now in fashion, a lot of women are dressing down, more casually and simply,"" said Danielle Prescod, fashion editor for Elle.com. ""There is a movement happening toward 'normcore.' ... Something like the Apple watch, that looks great but also has a purpose, is perfect for this trend."" Related: Sorry Apple. Solar dresses are the future . Prescod doesn't usually wear watches, but said she would consider this one. ""The good thing about the Apple watch is that it's super buzzy right now so people will notice it without needing a ton of other accessories that might try to compete for the spotlight,"" said Prescod. No matter how useful it is, once a wearable device is written off as un-cool, it marks the wearer as dorky. Not everyone believes the Apple Watch can avoid the stigma of a Bluetooth headset -- or even Google Glass. ""The Apple Watch is the ultimate in geek chic, designed to look like a watch, but it leaves something to be desired when it comes to reflecting personal style,"" said Tyson White, vice president of product at Nixon, a trendy California watch company. It ""will certainly raise people's expectations about what a watch can do. ... But it appears to compete more with the likes of Fitbit, Fuel band and other smartwatch offerings, more so than traditional watches."" Beyond looks, Apple will also have to overcome a limited battery life and dependence on the iPhone. But if any technology company has a chance of stealing precious wrist real estate from established watch companies, it's Apple.","Apple's new smartwatch was designed to be a fashion accessory as well as a gadget .
It comes in two sizes, different finishes and has multiple slick strap options .
Apple is going up against huge watch companies and an industry that has been around for a century .
The device could be the next iPod or it could go the way of the Bluetooth headset ."
"(CNN) -- Gas prices approaching $4 a gallon on average are causing severe economic pain for millions of Americans. Pump prices spiked 5% in the past month alone. Crude oil prices stood at $108 on Friday, up from only double digits at the beginning of the month. What's the cause? Forget what you may have read about the laws of supply and demand. Oil and gas prices have almost nothing to do with economic fundamentals. According to the Energy Information Administration, the supply of oil and gasoline is higher today than it was three years ago, when the national average for a gallon of gasoline was just $1.90. Meanwhile, the demand for oil in the U.S. is at its lowest level since April of 1997. Is Big Oil to blame? Sure. Partly. Big oil companies have been gouging consumers for years. They have made almost $1 trillion in profits over the past decade, in part thanks to ridiculous federal subsidies and tax loopholes. I have proposed legislation to end those pointless giveaways to some of the biggest and most profitable corporations in the history of the world. But there's another reason for the wild rise in gas prices. The culprit is Wall Street. Speculators are raking in profits by gambling in the loosely regulated commodity markets for gas and oil. A decade ago, speculators controlled only about 30% of the oil futures market. Today, Wall Street speculators control nearly 80% of this market. Many of those people buying and selling oil in the commodity markets will never use a drop of this oil. They are not airlines or trucking companies who will use the fuel in the future. The only function of the speculators in this process is to make as much money as they can, as quickly as they can. I've seen the raw documents that prove the role of speculators. Commodity Futures Trading Commission records showed that in the summer of 2008, when gas prices spiked to more than $4 a gallon, speculators overwhelmingly controlled the crude oil futures market. The commission, which supposedly represents the interests of the American people, had kept the information hidden from the public for nearly three years. That alone is an outrage. The American people had a right to know exactly who caused gas prices to skyrocket in 2008 and who is causing them to spike today. Even those inside the oil industry have admitted that speculation is driving up the price of gasoline. The CEO of Exxon-Mobil, Rex Tillerson, told a Senate hearing last year that speculation was driving up the price of a barrel of oil by as much as 40%. The general counsel of Delta Airlines, Ben Hirst, and the experts at Goldman Sachs also said excessive speculation is causing oil prices to spike by up to 40%. Even Saudi Arabia, the largest exporter of oil in the world, told the Bush administration back in 2008, during the last major spike in oil prices, that speculation was responsible for about $40 of a barrel of oil. Just last week, Commissioner Bart Chilton, one of the only Commodity Futures Trading Commission members looking out for consumers, calculated how much extra drivers are being charged as a result of Wall Street speculation. If you drive a relatively fuel-efficient vehicle such as a Honda Civic, you pay an extra $7.30 every time you fill your tank. For larger vehicles, such as a Ford F150, drivers pay an extra $14.56 for each fill-up. That works out to more than $750 a year going directly from your wallet or pocketbook to the Wall Street speculators. So as speculators gamble, millions of Americans are paying what amounts to a ""speculators tax"" to feed Wall Street's greed. People who live in rural areas like my home state of Vermont are hit harder than most because they buy gas to drive long distances to their jobs. It doesn't have to work this way. The current spike in oil and gasoline prices was avoidable. Under the Wall Street reform act that Congress passed in 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was ordered to impose strict limits on the amount of oil that Wall Street speculators could trade in the energy futures market. The regulators dragged their feet. Finally, after months and months of law-breaking delays, the commission in October adopted a rule. It was a weak version of a proposal that might have put meaningful limits on the number of futures and swaps contracts a single trader could hold. Even the watered-down regulation adopted by the industry-friendly commission was challenged in court. The Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association wanted free rein to continue unregulated gambling in the oil markets. So today, Wall Street once again is laughing all the way to the bank. Once again, federal regulators should move aggressively to end excessive oil speculation. We must do everything we can to lower gas prices so that they reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand and bring needed relief to the American people. The time for real action is now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sen. Bernie Sanders.","Bernie Sanders: Speculators cash in by jacking up oil and gas prices; market loosely regulated .
Speculators controlled 30% of the oil futures market 10 years ago: up to 80% today, he writes .
Sanders: As speculators gamble, Americans pay a virtual speculators' tax on gas .
We can lower gas prices so they reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand, he says ."
"(CNN) -- Three months after leaving Barcelona following a trophyless season, Gerardo Martino has been appointed coach of the Argentina national team. Affectionately known as ""Tata,"" Martino replaces Alejandro Sabella after he led Argentina to an agonizing 1-0 defeat against Germany in last month's World Cup final. Martino arrived in Catalonia as a replacement for Tito Vilanova, who was forced to step down in July 2013 as he battled throat cancer. Vilanova passed away earlier this year. Despite signing a two-year contract, Martino lasted just one season at the Nou Camp, missing out on the La Liga title to Atletico Madrid on the final day of the season having been eliminated at the quarterfinal stage of the European Champions League by the same opposition. The 51-year-old now has the chance to manage a national team for the second time in his career following a five-year stint in charge of Paraguay between 2006 and 2011. Martino enjoys a good relationship with Argentina captain and Barca star Lionel Messi, having managed Argentine club Newell's Old Boys while the four-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner was in its youth team. The primary focus for Martino and the Argentina team will be the 2015 Copa America, which takes place in Chile during June and July next year.","Gerardo Martino appointed as new coach of the Argentina national team .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Everybody has to start somewhere. That includes all of the celebrities, billionaires, executives and CEOs of the world -- even U.S. presidents. So where did they begin their careers? Read on to find out what 11 U.S. presidents did before landing in office. 1. George Washington . Before he became the first president of the United States, George Washington was a surveyor. Surveyors measure land, air space and water, explain what it looks like or how much is there, and then put those facts into legal documents. Washington was the official surveyor for his county in 1749, which allowed him to purchase his first piece of land in western Virginia. (""Washington: A Life,"" by Ron Chernow.) 2. John Adams . John Adams, the second U.S. president, was expected to become a minister, but he wasn't sure he wanted to take that career path. After teaching for a few years, Adams decided to become a lawyer and was admitted to the bar in 1758. (""John Adams: A Life,"" by John E. Ferling.) 3. Thomas Jefferson . Before taking office as the third president of the United States, Thomas Jefferson was somewhat of a jack of all trades. Growing up, he studied history, science, math, metaphysics and philosophy, in addition to several languages. As a result, he was recognized as a horticulturist, political leader, architect, archaeologist, paleontologist, musician and inventor. He also founded the University of Virginia. (""Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation: A Biography,"" by Merrill D. Peterson.) CareerBuilder.com: Jobs that pay well, no degree required . 4. Abraham Lincoln . After a brief stint as owner of a general store in 1832, Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was the postmaster for the area in which he lived. After that, he taught himself to become the county surveyor. Then he became a lawyer, another self-taught profession. He was admitted to the bar in 1837. (""Lincoln,"" by David Herbert Donald.) 5. Andrew Johnson . Before his career in politics, Andrew Johnson worked as an apprentice tailor for his mother while in his adolescent years. He eventually left his apprenticeship and found work as a tailor in South Carolina and Tennessee. He became the 17th president of the United States in 1865. (Encyclopedia Britannica and ""Labor of Innocents: Forced Apprenticeship in North Carolina, 1715 - 1919,"" by Karin Zipf.) 6. James Garfield . James Garfield, the 20th president of the United States, dabbled in education before entering the second-shortest presidential term in 1881. He was a preacher for about a year at a Christian church when he decided to try his hand as principal of a high school in New York. When another applicant got the job, he became an instructor at the Eclectic Institute, where he taught classical languages and then was made principal. (""Garfield,"" by Allan Peskin.) CareerBuilder.com: An entire career at one company . 7. William Howard Taft . William Howard Taft was in the legal field before his presidency in 1908. After passing the bar, Taft was the assistant prosecutor for his county in Ohio. In 1882, he was selected as local collector of internal revenue (IRS, anyone?). A few years later, he was appointed a judge on the Ohio Superior Court and then in 1890, President Benjamin Harrison appointed him solicitor general of the United States, otherwise known as the person who represents the government before the Supreme Court. (""William Howard Taft"" by the National Park Service and ""William Howard Taft"" by Walter Hertz, Unitarian Universalist Historical Society.) 8. Woodrow Wilson . Woodrow Wilson also got his start in education. After receiving his Ph.D., he was a visiting lecturer at Cornell University in 1886, but wasn't offered a full-time gig. He landed teaching jobs at Bryn Mawr College (1885-1888) and Wesleyan University (1888-1890), where he coached the football team. Wilson was also the president of Princeton University from 1902 to 1910 and was elected president in 1912. (""Wilson, Woodrow,"" by Arthur S. Link.) 9. Herbert Hoover . Herbert Hoover graduated in 1895 with a degree in geology. He served as a geologist and mining engineer while searching the Western Australian gold fields in 1897. After being appointed mine manager at 23, he mined the Sons of Gwalia gold mine, and also the Big Bell, Cue, Leonora, Menzies and Coolgardie mines. He continued his mining and engineering career until 1908, when he became an independent mining consultant. He was elected to office in 1928. (Gwalia Historic Site and ""Hoover's Gold,"" from Australian Broadcasting Corp.) CareerBuilder.com: 2 weeks at this job and I HATE it -- should I quit? 10. Ronald Reagan . Ronald Reagan was an actor before taking office as the 40th U.S. president in 1981. He starred in more than 50 movies, was president of the Screen Actors Guild, and was a spokesman for General Electric, which is when he got his start in politics. Before that, Reagan was a sports broadcaster at the University of Iowa, where he was paid $10 per game. He became a radio announcer before working as an announcer for the Chicago Cubs. He received his contract with Warner Brothers in 1937. (""Actor, Governor, President, Icon,"" by Lou Cannon, The Washington Post). 11. Barack Obama . Current U.S. President Barack Obama had several jobs before being elected as the first African-American president in 2008. Obama worked for three years as director of the Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization in Chicago. He also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community-organizing institute in Chicago. (""Who's Who in America, 2008,"" Karen Chassie.) &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011.

"(CNN) -- The extremist Sunni militant group that recently declared a caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq wrested control of a major Syrian oil field in a sweeping land grab Thursday, a UK-based monitoring group said. A string of villages and towns along the Euphrates River fell like dominoes to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, bridging the Syrian province of Deir Ezzour with the group's recently gained territories in Iraq's Sunni heartland, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported. A video statement from the leaders in the town of al-Shahil announcing their withdrawal from all anti-ISIS organizations triggered the quick fall of a majority of Deir Ezzour province. ""We also decided to swear allegiance to the Caliph Abo Baker Al Baghdadi, noting that we are not responsible for those who breach this agreement and to call him to account if possible,"" a town representative in the video says in reference to ISIS's shadowy leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Fighters for the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, the largest and most powerful affront to ISIS, had been headquartered in al-Shahil. Fighters began melting away late Wednesday. After taking control of al-Shahil, ISIS demanded that fighters surrender their weapons and repent for fighting ISIS. It then called on residents to leave the town for a week to 10 days until ""peace returns to the streets,"" a social media video obtained by activists shows. MAPS: Understanding the Iraq crisis . With Nusra Front's bastion in the east defeated, ISIS militants simply rolled through, unopposed, staking their black and white flag through most of the oil-rich province, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Deir Ezzour said in a statement. ""Most of the activists that were opposed to ISIS have disappeared. Some are trying to flee to Turkey and others are pledging allegiance to the Islamic State along with other factions."" Abu Abdallah, an opposition activist in Deir Ezzour, told CNN. The capture of al-Omar oil field, the country's largest and most important oil facility, with a capacity to produce 75,000 barrels of oil daily, is the jewel in a string of gains that includes a military airport and a local army base. ""We took control without any clashes. They just fled,"" a bearded radical fighter from ISIS said in amateur video posted online Thursday from the oil field, ""as proof, here is their ammunition and weapons."" Resource-poor rebel factions in Aleppo responded to the series of surrenders by calling for a full mobilization of all able-bodied men to fight ISIS's relentless march on opposition held territory in Syria. ""We demand that everyone, including civilians, report to the front lines so it will be a decisive war between us and them. Let's us show them what Aleppo is made of,"" a statement from Abu Tawfiq, a Tawheed Brigade military commander, reads. ""We should never allow them to keep destroying our country and killing our people. Anyone who does not heed this call has no excuse."" ISIS, so radical that al Qaeda's central command disowned it earlier this year, now controls an estimated 20,000 non-contiguous square miles stretching from Syria's Aleppo Province to just 60 kilometers west of the Iraqi capital, according to the SOHR. The group rules by a barbaric interpretation of Islamic law that includes the torture and imprisonment of opponents, the oppression of women and Christians, and even public beheadings and crucifixions . Last weekend, the group announced the creation of a so-called Islamic State or Caliphate that erases all state borders and make its leader the self-declared authority over the world's 1.5 billion Muslims. While many members of the faith dismiss the claims as outlandish, analysts say the rapid rise of the fanatical force is sure to have a lasting impact on the region, particularly in weak Middle Eastern states such as Jordan. 8 killed in Baghdad bombing as Iraqi PM declares amnesty for tribes .

"(CNN) -- You've never heard of XKeyscore, but it definitely knows you. The National Security Agency's top-secret program essentially makes available everything you've ever done on the Internet — browsing history, searches, content of your emails, online chats, even your metadata — all at the tap of the keyboard. The Guardian exposed the program on Wednesday in a follow-up piece to its groundbreaking report on the NSA's surveillance practices. Shortly after publication, Edward Snowden, a 29-year-old former Booz Allen Hamilton employee who worked for the NSA for four years, came forward as the source. This latest revelation comes from XKeyscore training materials, which Snowden also provided to The Guardian. The NSA sums up the program best: XKeyscore is its ""widest reaching"" system for developing intelligence from the Internet. The program gives analysts the ability to search through the entire database of your information without any prior authorization — no warrant, no court clearance, no signature on a dotted line. An analyst must simply complete a simple onscreen form, and seconds later, your online history is no longer private. The agency claims that XKeyscore covers ""nearly everything a typical user does on the Internet."" As The Guardian points out, this program crystallizes one of Snowden's most infamous admissions from his video interview on June 10: . ""I, sitting at my desk,"" said Snowden, could ""wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email."" While United States officials denied this claim, the XKeyscore program, as the public understands it, proves Snowden's point. The law requires the NSA to obtain FISA warrants on U.S. citizens, but this is pushed aside for Americans with foreign targets — and this program gives the NSA the technology to do so. The training materials claim XKeyscore assisted in capturing 300 terrorists by 2008. The Guardian article breaks down how the program works with each activity, from email monitoring to chats and browsing history, and includes screenshots from the training materials. The Guardian reached out to the NSA for comment prior to publication. The agency defended the program, stressing that it was only used to legally obtain information about ""legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests."" ""XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system,"" the agency said in its response. ""Allegations of widespread, unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data are simply not true. Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA's analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks ... . ""In addition, there are multiple technical, manual and supervisory checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from occurring. Every search by an NSA analyst is fully auditable, to ensure that they are proper and within the law. These types of programs allow us to collect the information that enables us to perform our missions successfully -- to defend the nation and to protect U.S. and allied troops abroad."" XKeyscore is the second black mark on the NSA's record in the past few weeks. The Guardian's first story uncovered PRISM, a highly controversial surveillance program that reportedly allows the security agency to access the servers of major Internet organizations including Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, YouTube and Skype, among others. Snowden's information led to a public outcry for transparency, and the U.S. government pushed to declassify more information about PRISM in an effort to paint a clearer picture about the program. Snowden has been charged with espionage. He is currently holed up in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport while his request for asylum is under review by Russian immigration authorities, according to Snowden's lawyer.

"(CNN) -- The 4-year-old daughter of former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson died Tuesday, a day after she was injured in a treadmill accident at her home, police in Phoenix, Arizona, said. Former world boxing champion Mike Tyson traveled from Las Vegas to Phoenix to be at his daughter's bedside. Exodus Tyson was pronounced dead at 11:45 a.m. local time Tuesday, said Sgt. Andy Hill, a Phoenix police spokesman. ""The Tyson family would like to extend our deepest and most heartfelt thanks for all your prayers and support, and we ask that we be allowed our privacy at this difficult time,"" the family said in a statement. The girl's 7-year-old brother found her on a treadmill in the Phoenix home Monday. She had been strangled by a cord connected to the machine, said Sgt. Andy Hill of the Phoenix Police Department. ""We believe the child was on the treadmill but it was not running at the time. She might have been playing like it was,"" Hill said. Her brother called his mother to the room. She removed Exodus from the machine and called 911. The girl's mother performed CPR on her, but she was unconscious and in need of life support by the time authorities arrived, Hill said. Former world heavyweight champion Tyson on Monday traveled from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Phoenix where his daughter was on life support in critical condition, police said. ""After a thorough investigation, it appears that this is nothing except a horrible tragedy,"" Hill told CNN's Larry King.  Watch an exclusive report from ""Larry King Live"" » .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes I think the media live in a time warp. There's so much talk about Hillary Clinton and the expanding/shrinking/expanding field of possible Republican candidates, you'd think we're in the middle of an Olympics ratings battle. The media focus on 2016 is like a ""Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" without Rocky. It's really an obsession that is not only misguided but also does a disservice both to voters and candidates. The two-year out speculation track record is pretty bad. Yes, Clinton is dynamic. Even her most rabid detractors must admit that. But her dynamism is not a guarantee victory. Her nomination is not inevitable. She knows upfront the toll campaigning demands and what being president exacts. As George Harrison said about being a Beatle, you have to give your nervous system. If Clinton decides to run, she has to do so knowing it is a commitment that may last 11 years. She's 66. (Joe Biden, 71, and Mike Huckabee, 58, also have to consider their age.) It's not just how old a person might be at the end of her, or his, term. The question is, will one have the energy and will power to finish the job? We age better and healthier, but being president is aging like nothing else. Clinton's understudy waits in the wings . Does Clinton want to make a time commitment that could amount to the rest of her life? Another factor surely affecting Clinton's decision is her legacy. Despite repeated attempts by Republicans, she remains very popular. In a 2013 Gallup Poll she was named the woman people most admired. A presidential run would risk that popularity -- and the legacy she's built as a senator and secretary of state (not to mention former first lady). Of course, she could also leverage that popularity to lead our nation in a great new direction. Potential candidates may also weigh on her mind. Who else might run if she doesn't? If the rest of the field looks weak, she might feel a sense of duty to her party and her country. If there are strong ""next generation"" candidates, she may be content, perhaps glad, to work for their success. The point is that there are factors that may induce Hillary Clinton not to run, and nobody will know what will influence her decision -- until she decides. Speculation about Republican candidates is even sketchier. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who only a few weeks ago seemed the prime-time contender, now appears on the ropes. Other prominent Republicans have also taken their hits recently -- understandable, given the current fighting among the factions. So, who knows? I can make one prediction safely: Going through the list of who's up and who's down until the nomination(s) is (are) secured will make any roller coaster ride seem like a walk in the park. I've got a name for the media's obsession with potential 2016 nominees, or really any idle speculation without substance -- talking-head-vacuum syndrome. Instead of acting like junior high gossips though, the media might try focusing on real issues that are current and important. There are lots of them out there. I'll focus on one example. Two years ago saw a breakthrough for women officeholders. I've written about this before: There are now 20 women senators. One of the big questions in 2014 is: Can Democrats retain control of the Senate? ""Conventional wisdom"" held that it would be tough. But the game is changing, thanks to a couple of dynamic women candidates. In Georgia, which has been a Deep South Republican stronghold -- since 2010, they've held every statewide office -- Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn, stands a good chance of becoming another woman senator -- and a Democratic one. Parsing Biden's words: If Hillary runs, he won't . She is leading or tied with all her opponents in the polls. She has the advantages of a famous name in Georgia, a middle-of-the road message and lots of campaign discipline. Her father was known for his bipartisanship and reaching across the aisle -- and she's already following in his footsteps. And although Georgia is staunchly conservative, the state's demographics are shifting, with more African-Americans returning and the immigrant population growing. Then there's the race in Kentucky, where Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes holds a lead of 4 percentage points over Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell is arguably the most powerful Republican in the Senate, and if his seat -- if a seat in Kentucky is up for grabs -- the dynamics of the Senate need to be re-examined. Trust me, if those two women win their seats, the ripple effect will become a tidal wave. And there are other races where women have raised the stakes. Wendy Davis' bid to be governor of Texas has drawn national attention and already reframed several of the issues in that state. My point is that we're more than 1,000 days away from the inauguration of the next president, and there's a lot going on now that needs more attention from the media. This year could become a breakthrough for women in American politics. Let's give that the coverage it deserves. The 2016 election can wait. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile says the media is spending way too much time focusing on Hillary Clinton .

"(CNN) -- Joe McGinniss could not believe his eyes. The man he saw in a North Carolina courtroom last week was stooped and shackled, hardly the same smooth and swaggering Jeffrey MacDonald who had told his story so many years ago. To say the author and the convicted killer have a history would be an understatement. If anything, their first face-to-face meeting in 35 years was anticlimactic. ""He looked like a shadow,"" McGinniss said of MacDonald, now 68, who some believe the author betrayed for his 1983 best-selling book ""Fatal Vision."" ""He has a pallor, there was no substance to him,"" McGinniss continued. ""I guess many years in prison can do that to you."" McGinniss testified earlier this month for the prosecution at a federal hearing in Wilmington, North Carolina, that could determine whether or not MacDonald deserves freedom, or at least a new trial. MacDonald's lawyers assert that newly-discovered DNA evidence -- three hairs that match neither MacDonald nor any of the victims -- and the secondhand confession of a key witness who claimed to be at the family's home the night of the murders justify reopening the case. Judge hears new evidence in 'Fatal Vision' case . McGinniss said in court that he considers the latest defense maneuver to be ""the Holy Grail,"" MacDonald's last chance at freedom. He remains convinced of MacDonald's guilt. The attorneys finished their closing arguments on Monday, and the decision is now in the hands of U.S. District Judge John C. Fox. The judge could let MacDonald's murder convictions stand, toss them out, or order another trial. It is expected to take weeks, perhaps months, before a ruling comes in a criminal saga that has made headlines for four decades. It began when military police officers were summoned to the MacDonald home at Fort Bragg, North Carolina on February 17, 1970. Inside, they found a horrific crime scene. MacDonald's pregnant wife, Colette, was stabbed 16 times with a knife and 21 times with an ice pick. Daughter Kimberly, 5, was bludgeoned and stabbed in the neck. Kristen, 2, was stabbed 48 times; a finger was nearly severed as she tried to fend off the blows. ""It was overkill,"" said McGinniss, who wrote that MacDonald killed his family in an amphetamine-fueled rage. MacDonald, a captain assigned to the Green Berets, also sustained a collapsed lung and two stab wounds in what he said was an attack on his family by a trio of intruders, including a woman in a floppy hat who chanted ""Acid is groovy"" and ""Kill the pigs."" The word ""pig"" was written in blood on a headboard, a detail reminiscent of the infamous 1969 Manson family murders in California. Prosecutors alleged MacDonald staged the crime scene. The Army investigated first, and MacDonald was cleared at a closed military hearing. But his father-in-law pushed civilian authorities to pursue the case and a grand jury indicted MacDonald in 1975. He was found guilty of murder four years later and is serving a three life sentences. If his appeal fails, he does not become eligible for parole until 2071. MacDonald has always insisted he is innocent, so the recent developments in the case come as no surprise to McGinniss. ""He's a psychopath. He doesn't have the kind of emotions that you and I would have,"" the author said. ""He doesn't have the capacity to feel badly about it. These weren't his wife and children. These were people that got in his way."" MacDonald's appeals received renewed attention with the release this month of the book ""A Wilderness of Error: The Trials of Jeffrey MacDonald."" Written by Academy-Award-winning documentary filmmaker Errol Morris, the book paints MacDonald as a man wrongly convicted on the basis of incomplete and corrupted evidence, as well as prosecutorial misconduct. ""We've been sold a bill of goods about this case,"" said Morris. ""It's as phony as a three-dollar bill."" Writer seeks to clear MacDonald . Asked about the controversy, McGinniss was pragmatic in his response. ""It doesn't matter what I think of what Morris thinks,"" he said. ""MacDonald was convicted by a jury in a court of law. He's not in prison because of me and he's not going to get out of prison because of Errol Morris."" McGinniss also tried to put the rest the notion that he was a passionate believer in MacDonald when he embarked on ""Fatal Vision."" He says he was embedded with the defense team because he was looking for a different angle. ""I thought it would be fascinating to write about the trial from the point of view of how the defense and defendant were experiencing it. I learned everything from the first time in court. I didn't have my mind made up."" McGinniss said what he heard in court was overwhelmingly convincing. ""There came a point in the trial when much to my dismay I started to feel this evidence is piling up and MacDonald isn't doing anything to dispute it. By the end it was still very confusing. I said to myself, 'I think this guy did it,' but he was so charismatic and likable and had such a strong personality. This was before I learned about the psychopathic personality."" McGinniss also disputed the notion raised by the defense and Morris that the prosecutor at the criminal trial threatened witness Helena Stoeckley to alter her testimony. Stoeckley, who died in 1983, had admitted to others that she was present for the killings but she denied it on the witness stand at MacDonald's trial. Watching MacDonald in court again reminded McGinniss of how much has changed in the three decades since he last laid eyes on him. ""It was in 1987 during the trial of the civil suit against me,"" McGinniss said. ""He was allowed to wear a new suit of clothes. He looked like the host of a daytime game show."" In the civil case, MacDonald accused the author of breaching an agreement to write a book about his innocence. The jury deadlocked and the case was settled out of court for a reported $325,000. Journalist Janet Malcolm wrote a widely read article about the case and was critical of McGinniss, accusing him of deceiving MacDonald by pretending to believe he was innocent after becoming convinced of his guilt. McGinniss now has another controversial book out, ""The Rogue,"" a biography of Sarah Palin. In court, MacDonald literally seemed to McGinniss to be a ghost from the past. ""The years since have not treated him kindly,"" he said. ""He sat there at the end of the table and was whispering. He seemed insubstantial. ""I looked at him but he would never look me in the eyes.""","Author Joe McGinniss wrote about Jeffrey MacDonald in 'Fatal Vision'

"(CNN) -- After an unexpected loss in the Republican primary, former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor resigned from Congress and nabbed the brass ring: A lucrative vice chairmanship at boutique investment firm Moelis & Co., along with a slot on its board of directors. The ex-representative for Virginia's 7th Congressional District will be making at least $1.6 million next year in addition to a hefty signing bonus. The revolving door to Wall Street is a fact of political life in Washington and won't change anytime soon. That's still no excuse for ignoring it. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, at least a dozen lawmakers have left public office since 2007 to work for Wall Street firms with a lobbying presence in Washington -- often heading up their D.C. operations, as Cantor will be doing. But if the only result is that former congressional members are handsomely rewarded for their expertise, then what's the harm? The problem is that they're not hired for their expertise in finance; they may not even know much of anything about investment banking or finance. They're hired to influence legislation by making introductions and giving the kind of insider advice that nobody, not even the best-connected K Streeters, have. People like Cantor are not technically lobbyists, but they are expected to use their knowledge as former insiders to strategize for their new employers about how to navigate Congress and who they need to lobby in order to pass, kill or -- as is most typical -- stall legislation. In short, they can help devise the plan to shepherd their new employer's agenda through Capitol Hill. What Cantor will do for Moelis merits scrutiny because the ability to hire a marquee name like Eric Cantor means that his new bosses and shareholders have a substantial leg up, not just on the competition, but on civil servants whose job it is to produce policy that serves the public rather than private interest. Of course, the perspectives of companies like Moelis & Co. are legitimate and useful and should never be censored. Companies providing more information to policymakers is ideal, as long as it's not deceptive or misleading. Tea party's take on Eric Cantor: We told you so . However, members of Congress are continually pitched by the special interests on which they depend on to fund their re-election efforts. They receive expert opinions polished and shaped for their easy adoption from the very people who are supplying their campaign cash. Both sides have serious conflicts of interest. If members of Congress want to know how positions favored by various interests would affect their district, state or the national interest, they have to do their own due diligence by hunting down a source for credible, expert, unbiased research or produce it themselves. They may not hear from their constituents, especially on arcane issues that pit one industry against another. In addition, they face time pressures, reduced committee and office budgets as well as limited staff and resources. So it should be no surprise that Congress is an easy mark for a former member to not only navigate but exploit. Wall Street bosses expect that former Washington movers and shakers on their payroll will offer access and a shortcut to success, if not outright deliver, on their clients' agendas. What people like Cantor could do is end up serving themselves and their employer at the risk of doing a huge disservice to their former constituents. If the money outweighs all other concerns, the broader public interest rarely wins. Elected officials and the staff that help them keep up with complex issues are largely driven, we hope and expect, by a desire to make a difference in the world. The revolving door lures them away from the public service to work on behalf of elite interests that are elite, in part, because they're already investing big money to play the Washington Game. Let's hope in his new role, Cantor is merely the well-paid VIP shown off to impress clients, and not also required to put his thumb on the scale on their behalf.","Former Congressman Eric Cantor has a new lucrative job at an investment firm .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- For residents of Gaza and southern Israel, the fleeting period of calm is over. The Israeli military said aircraft carried out strikes on at least 70 militant targets in Gaza on Friday in response to a barrage of rocket fire after a three-day truce in the region came to an end without a longer-term agreement. At least 50 rockets were fired at Israel after the cease-fire expired Friday morning, the Israel Defense Forces said. Most of the rockets hit unpopulated areas, but one wounded a civilian and slightly wounded a soldier, the IDF said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon ordered the military to respond forcefully to the resumption in rocket fire, Israeli officials said. The IDF said it ""targeted terror sites across the Gaza Strip."" Several explosions were heard in Gaza City as Israeli fighter jets flew overhead. Local media reported airstrikes elsewhere in the territory. One strike in Gaza City killed a 10-year-old boy, said Ashraf el-Qedra, a spokesman for the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Hamas, the Islamic militant group that holds power in Gaza, said that Palestinian officials at peace talks in Cairo hadn't agreed to extend the truce but would continue negotiations. But Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN that the resumption of rocket fire means Hamas has ""broken the fundamental premise of the talks in Cairo."" Violence flares in the West Bank . With the cease-fire over, unrest spread to the West Bank, where a 19-year-old man was shot and killed by a Israeli soldier near a settlement east of Ramallah, medical officials told CNN. A dozen Palestinian youths were throwing stones at a watchtower near the Ammari camp in alBireh when an Israeli soldier opened fire and killed Mohammad al-Qatari, according to the medical officials. Dr. Ahamad Bitwai, head of the Ramallah medical complex, said the young man was shot in the chest and died on the way to the hospital. In Hebron, at least 40 people were hurt during clashes between Palestinians and Israeli military and border police near the old city. According to the official Palestinian new agency WAFA, 23 of the injuries were from live fire. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations erupted in many areas of the West Bank after Friday prayers. The IDF said dozens of rioters near Ramallah hurled rocks at soldiers, who responded by using ""riot dispersal means"" before ""exhausting all possible measures"" and resorting to gunfire. ""A hit was confirmed and the incident is being reviewed,"" the IDF said in a statement. Islamic Jihad and the Al-Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades, two militant factions that have fought alongside Hamas in Gaza under the banner of ""the resistance,"" said they fired rockets at Israel on Friday. ""The enemy ended the cease-fire when he refused to accept the demands of the resistance and he bears responsibility for the consequences of that,"" the military wing of Islamic Jihad said in a statement. Two rockets fired from Gaza hit southern Israel a few hours before the truce was due to end Friday, the IDF said. They caused no casualties. Hamas denied responsibility for firing the rockets, which landed near Eshkol, said Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior spokesman for the group. No breakthrough in talks . The rocket fire came as hopes faded for an agreement to extend the Egyptian-brokered cease-fire, which began Tuesday. During the truce, Israeli and Palestinian delegations held indirect talks in Cairo through Egyptian go-betweens, but the two sides appeared to be far apart in their positions. A Palestinian member of the negotiating delegation, not authorized to speak to the media directly about the talks, told CNN on condition of anonymity that the two sides failed to agree on the wording of a cease-fire extension that included the Palestinian demand for Israel to lift the blockade on Gaza. The official also indicated the Israeli negotiators declined Palestinian demands to re-open the Gaza airport and seaport, and to release prisoners who had been released and rearrested in June. One key Palestinian economic demand centered on fishing rights. The Palestinians are currently allowed to fish up to three miles off the Gaza coast, and they demanded that be extended to 20 miles. Abu Zuhri said Israel was willing to extend fishing rights to only six miles off the coast. The fishing industry in Gaza is a major part of the territory's economy. Israel said Thursday it was willing to extend the cease-fire unconditionally. The country's military said earlier in the week it had achieved its goal of destroying Hamas' network of tunnels that extend under the border into Israel. After the rocket fire Friday, however, Israel's Foreign Ministry said on Twitter that the country ""will not conduct negotiations while under fire."" Hamas leaders said the Israelis bear responsibility for the breakdown of the talks. Abu Zuhri said the Palestinian delegation arrived in Cairo five days in advance in an effort to reach a cease-fire agreement, but the Palestinian delegation did not receive an Israeli response to its demands. ""We did not see any effort from the Israelis to encourage us to extend the cease fire agreement. As result, the Palestinian delegation, collectively, decided not to extend the cease fire agreement,"" said Abu Zuhri. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Friday expressed his ""deep disappointment that the parties were unable to agree to an extension of the ceasefire."" Israel's U.N. ambassador, Ron Prosor, responded with a message on the U.N. Facebook page, saying: ""If I wasn't familiar with the UN, I would think this is a parody. But because I am familiar with the UN, I know this is a tragedy."" The message added, ""Your statement said that you were disappointed that the parties were unable to agree to an extension of the ceasefire. I couldn't help but notice that you didn't mention one of the parties, which happens to be the party that violated the ceasefire. This party has a name -- they are called Hamas."" Civilian population suffering . The lack of a deal appears to be reviving a conflict that brought death and destruction to large areas of Gaza and thousands of rockets fired at Israel. Renewed hostilities also deepen the misery for people in Gaza who were wounded, displaced or deprived of basic necessities by the first four weeks of fighting. On Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health issued new casualty numbers for the conflict -- 1,898 deaths, including 446 children, and 9,837 injured. It's unclear how many of the Palestinian dead were militants. The United Nations estimates that at least 70% of the dead were civilians. The Israel Defense Forces says it believes roughly half of the dead -- about 900 people -- were militants. Israeli officials say 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel have died. Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted many of the rockets fired at populated areas of the country. Additionally, about 65,000 Gaza residents lost their homes to the fighting, according to U.N. estimates. The territory is also short on running water, power and medical supplies.

"Freetown, Sierra Leone (CNN) -- Guinea has closed its border with Sierra Leone to suppress the spread of the deadly Ebola virus, a Sierra Leone border police official told CNN. The virulent virus continues to advance from its epicenter in Sierra Leone to neighboring Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria. Other West African governments are attempting to contain the outbreak, which has been declared a ""public health emergency of international concern"" by the World Health Organization. The United States and the United Kingdom welcomed the efforts of the World Health Organization to halt the spread of Ebola and on Saturday vowed to increase assistance to help combat the disease in West Africa. Treating Ebola in Sierra Leone: 'We are two steps behind' Meanwhile, the Zambian government banned arrivals of people from countries where there has been an Ebola outbreak, as a preventative measure to stop the virus from entering the country. ""All delegates from any of the countries affected by Ebola Virus disease are restricted from entering Zambia until further notice,"" said Dr. Joseph Kasonde, Zambia's Minister of Health in a statement on Saturday. Ebola virus: 9 things to know about the killer disease . Since the onset earlier this year, the virus is believed to have infected 1,779 people, killing 961 according to the latest figures released by WHO. Nigeria and Liberia have both declared a state of national emergency this week, in an effort to control the unprecedented epidemic. Canadian health officials announced Saturday that a patient who recently traveled to Nigeria is being tested for Ebola. The patient is being treated in isolation at Brampton Hospital in the Toronto area after complaining of fever, headache and malaise. Those test results are expected by the end of the weekend, according to hospital spokesman David Jensen.

"Washington (CNN) -- It was a one-minute spot that aired just one time, but with an ominous countdown and a mushroom cloud, Lyndon B. Johnson's ""Daisy"" ad marked a new era in American politics. Considered the first attack ad, the Daisy spot, which turned 50 on Sunday, features a little girl sweetly plucking petals from a flower as she counts her small collection out loud. The screen freezes and suddenly we hear an alarming voice sound off a different countdown, this time it's one that leads to a nuclear explosion. Without mentioning Johnson's opponent or showing his image, the ad implies that Republican Barry Goldwater is a reckless warmonger whose presidency would result in a nuclear holocaust. Drew Babb, an advertising creative director who also teaches political ads at American University, said the spot mastered the cardinal rule of advertising: get noticed. It engaged viewers as political ads had never done before. ""It was an incredibly overt production, but it asked and dared people to bring their own reading to it,"" he told CNN. In one sense, he added, the spot is simple. It asked viewers to look at the girl, look at the bomb and vote for President Johnson. ""Those are the three dots to connect, but in the middle of those dots, there's a man who might be trigger happy,"" he said. ""It was both overt and subtle at the time, which was really hard to do in a 60-second spot."" The commercial, created by the advertising giant Doyle Dane Bernbach, ran on September 7, 1964, during an NBC broadcast of ""Monday Night at the Movies."" Babb said the spot played off the widespread fear at the time of nuclear warfare; the Cuban Missile Crisis happened just under two years prior. ""It scared the hell out of me when I saw it and it still does. As a callow young copywriter, I loved its bravura and slash-and-burn strategy. As a creative director and college professor, it gives me pause,"" he said. ""But it still makes me gasp every time I see it."" The Daisy ad set the stage for 50 more years of political ads. In his own words, Babb takes a look at five other spots that top his list of the most compelling ads: . 1) ""Mistakes"" -- 1969 . -- Re-elect campaign for John Lindsay, mayor of New York City . -- Produced by creative personnel at Young & Rubicam. Copy written by Tony Isidore. Why I admire it: Lindsay disarms us by actually admitting mistakes as mayor. Other than Jerry Springer running for governor of Ohio and apologizing for that pesky little canceled check at an escort service, when did you ever see that happen? The takeaway is strong: ""Yeah I've screwed up, but I've done good things and deserve re-election."" Strong, simple, elegant filming. One take; no teleprompter. Lindsay is in shirtsleeves, something that wasn't done all that much. He gives a stunning delivery. He was reportedly 17 points down in the election before this spot ran. He won. 2) ""Morning in America"" -- 1984 . -- Re-elect campaign for Ronald Reagan . -- Key creative personnel: Phil Dusenberry and Hal Riney; Riney did the voiceover. Why I admire it: Rarely has a political commercial captured the essence of a candidate as ""Morning"" did. Warm, upbeat, positively aw-shucks. The soft, gauzy images of a wedding, firemen, veterans, kids and American flags would not be out of place in one of the great Hallmark spots. And Hal Riney's voiceover is spot-on. He asks, ""Why would we ever go back?"" Hard to come up with an answer to that one. 3) ""Dinner Table"" -- 2012 . -- Americans for Prosperity (super PAC) Why I admire it: When everybody zigs by screaming and attacking and flashing cheesy quotes and graphics, you zag by whispering. That's what this commercial does. A family around a table. Mom, dad, two kids. Nobody says a word. They pick at their food. A few glances are exchanged. All you hear is a little fall of rain and the flatware clinking against the plates. No music, no voiceover, no nothing. A title comes up and reminds us how bad the employment rate is. Take away: These people are hungry and sad because of Obama's poor economic policy. A powerful spot for its silence. 4) ""47%"" -- 2012 . -- Obama for America . -- Putnam and Partners . Why I admire it: There were a number of strong spots, on both sides, in 2012. Some of the best were in the GOP primary before Mitt Romney was nominated. Rick Santorum ran two memorable spots ""Rombo"" and ""Obamaville."" But this spot aced them all. It takes Romney's embarrassingly smug words to a group of fat-cat donors and morphed them into suicidal missiles. When Putnam adds Dorothea Lange-quality portraits of the people Romney was dismissing, it's a devastatingly clear: He doesn't care about you, why should you care about him? 5) ""Spelling Bee"" -- 2014 . -- American Crossroads (super PAC) Why I admire it: This ad attacks Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Arkansas, for being closely attached to the Obama agenda, especially health care. It's a wonderfully produced snarky message. The filming, lighting, casting and set are all A+ and the double whammy at the end (the little girl spells Pryor ""O-B-A-M-A"" and the three adult judges respond, in a chorus, ""Close enough!"") is unforgettable. I wouldn't be surprised to see American Crossroads ""franchise"" this spot and adapt it for any state where they can Crazy Glue the Democrat to Obama.","The ""Daisy"" spot by Lyndon B.

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- Police on Wednesday arrested dozens of protesters threatening to shut down a portion of Interstate 70 near Ferguson, Missouri. Some demonstrators threw rocks at police during the emotionally charged protest, aimed at persuading Gov. Jay Nixon to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate last month's shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. CNN witnessed about two dozen people being taken into custody after refusing to leave the street. A crowd of protesters started gathering Wednesday afternoon on entrance and exit ramps to the interstate, stopping traffic on a nearby road but not the interstate itself. New Michael Brown shooting witnesses describe scene . As of 7 p.m., state troopers had arrested 35 people. Most of them face unlawful assembly charges, Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Al Nothum said. Four are charged with assault on a law enforcement officer. Police say bricks, stones, rocks, glass bottles and water bottles were thrown at officers. One protest organizer told CNN the objects were thrown by ""professional agitators,"" not protesters. Local authorities ordered protesters not to disrupt interstate traffic and stopped protesters from blocking the highway. ""Attempting to block an interstate highway is unsafe and unacceptable. ... People trying to shut down I-70 would not only create a very serious hazard for themselves, but also for motorists simply trying to get home from school or work,"" Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said before the protest, according to CNN affiliate KMOV. Demonstrators who weren't detained headed to downtown Ferguson to protest outside the police headquarters there. A grand jury is hearing the Brown case and will determine whether Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson will face any charges. The protest comes amid a busy week in the Brown case. What to know as grand jury takes the case . On Tuesday night, the Ferguson City Council met for the first time since the shooting, and on the agenda was the creation of a citizen review board to work with the Police Department. The meeting quickly turned rowdy, though, with some in attendance chanting Brown's name and shouting at council members, according to various media reports. ""You have the Michael Brown movement in your face because of your ongoing neglect,"" one woman told the council. Added another, ""We're not going to let you go back to business as usual."" The ordinance to create the citizen review board was read Tuesday, but it requires a second reading before the council can vote on it, Mayor James Knowles told the crowd, according to CNN affiliate KPLR. Also Tuesday, Circuit Court Judge Ellen Levy Siwak denied a request from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Brown's juvenile records be released, the paper reported. The paper sought the release of the records because there is heavy public interest in Brown's history. Though the records weren't released, a juvenile court lawyer said Brown had no serious felony convictions as a juvenile, and he was facing no charges at the time of his death. Earlier Tuesday, Brown's family members appeared alongside members of the NAACP and the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network, demanding that Wilson be arrested for Brown's death. ""Darren Wilson should be arrested, booked, fingerprinted and photographed,"" Brown family attorney Anthony Gray said during the Tuesday news conference.

"(CNN) -- In the wake of the Supreme Court decision that struck down key portions the Defense of Marriage Act, I celebrated this historic milestone like many Americans as a step toward acceptance of all people. Even though I'm straight, I relate to my LGBT brothers and sisters as I also struggle for others' acceptance. By all accounts, I appear to be a completely average 27-year-old female. I was never the kind of person who thought I'd champion for individual rights or equality. Sure, I believe in it, but I'm not the stereotypical ""Occupy"" protestor or gay rights advocate. On the outside, I look like many of my peers; I wear skinny jeans and Abercrombie. I play on my iPhone, Facebook and Twitter. I tend to blend seamlessly into the background of average female faces. However, I realize that my life as a typical twentysomething will not last long. As time goes on, I will start to become more and more isolated from my peer group as my secret comes out. You see, I don't want children. At first mention, this might seem like a minor comment. However, it is a choice that I feel has alienated me from my peers and will continue to do so as I creep toward middle age. The realization that I am somehow different is how I found myself standing up for my own personal beliefs and, along the way, championing equal rights for all. Although I know that I do not share the same predicament as gays and lesbians, I use the comparison to explain that I, too, am seeking acceptance in a world in which I often feel ostracized and out of place. I identify with many of my gay and lesbian friends in that I've always felt I should be honest about who I was. I don't think it's right to have to say, ""Well, we'll have kids someday,"" just as I don't think it's right for a gay man to have to say, ""Someday I'll meet a nice girl and settle down."" Like him, this is simply who I am. My ""coming out"" has been met with mixed reactions from family members. When I told my parents, my dad was quietly accepting and my mom cried endlessly. She didn't understand right away. Later, she accepted it and now supports my stand for equality. My husband and I argued about whether we should tell his parents. I said we should, while he said we should just say ""not now."" But I think that's being dishonest about who we are and even wonder if he is ashamed or not fully committed to our decision, although he says he is. I tell him he's still ""in the closet"" -- or perhaps even on the fence. I have a hard time identifying with people who do have children and have felt the brunt of many of their judgments. I have been called selfish and materialistic. But I don't believe that I am selfish by any means for making this responsible choice. It would be far more selfish to have a child for the wrong reasons. The pressure is particularly intense living in a military town in the South. I've had women tell me that I was a horrible person, a horrible wife and a horrible American because it was my ""duty"" to reproduce. I was shocked to hear such a statement in 2013. I was born in the 1980s -- what I thought was an age of enlightenment in which women no longer were pigeonholed into such archaic stereotypes. I have stated that I don't want children; now I ought to state what I do want. I want people to know that I like children. People assume I hate them. This isn't true. I have worked with children and have found it to be an incredibly rewarding experience. I want others to know that I am a practical person. I don't feel that it is right to raise a child in a home full of stress. I don't have an incredibly high-paying job, and I worry that I'll be burdened by student loan debt when I graduate from my doctoral program. A child is not a cute accessory that you drop off at day care and pick up at night. I realize that there is a commitment associated with raising a child, and it is not a commitment that I wish to make. I take commitments very seriously and think each and every decision through using logic and reasoning, and I've made this decision that same way. 'I am nobody's mother and I never will be' I want to be celebrated for what I have achieved and who I am as a person, not for what I am allegedly lacking. I want those who've offered to pray for me to direct their intentions and sympathies toward those who really need it. I have a great life. I have achieved almost all of my educational goals. I have a husband whom I love and a job that makes me happy. To waste sympathy on me would be abhorrent. I want to start an educated, informed discourse. I don't want to be spoken to in condescending tones and told that this is just a phase. I am not a small child who has developed finicky eating habits. I am a grown, responsible adult woman who has made a decision. Just as gays and lesbians do not ""outgrow"" their orientations, I don't believe that I will outgrow mine either. I want people to know that I do have a family. There are people who believe that I should not have married my husband because we don't plan to reproduce. I can't help but wonder: Is a family not made up of people who love and care for each other? Is there a minimum quota to be considered a family? Last time I checked, there wasn't. Are two people raising their offspring in an environment of anger, violence or poverty better people than my husband and I, whose house is filled with happiness and love? I want people to know that writing this essay is the boldest thing I have ever done in my life. I realize that by publishing it, I run the risk of being ostracized and alienated by many people. That's OK. It is a risk I am willing to take. Like the equal rights crusaders before me who have challenged the beliefs of society with regard to race, gender and sexual orientation, I realize that my views will not always be popular. I just wish to do my part in creating a society that allows everyone, regardless of personal choices, to be accepted and able to express themselves freely without fear of judgment.

"(CNN) -- The battle for control of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama began with a bold move by some of the crew to jump the pirates, crew members say. The crew of the Maersk Alabama exchange some words with media after the ship docked in Mombasa, Kenya. A scuffle ensued, and one of the sailors stabbed a pirate in the hand in the battle to retake the container ship, one of the sailors told CNN. Snippets of information are starting to emerge about how the Alabama's crew managed to retake the ship after it was hijacked by pirates Wednesday about 350 miles off the coast of Somalia in the Indian Ocean. The Alabama docked Saturday night in Mombasa, Kenya. Its captain, Richard Phillips, is being held by pirates in the ship's lifeboat in the Indian Ocean. Crew members smiled broadly as they stood on the ship's deck under the watchful eyes of security teams. Although they were kept away from the media, CNN's Stan Grant got close enough to ask them what happened after the pirates climbed aboard the ship. A crew member said he recalled being awakened around 7 a.m. as the hijacking began.  View a timeline of the attack and its aftermath » . ""I was scared,"" Grant quoted the man as saying. Some of the crew managed to hide in a secure part of the Alabama as the pirates stormed the ship, the sailor said. As the men described the clash, a crew member pointed to one shipmate and said, ""This guy is a hero. He and the chief engineer, they took down the pirate. ... He led him down there to the engine room and then they jumped him."" The shipmate added that he stabbed the pirate in the hand and tied him up. Another crew member shouted, ""Captain Phillips is a hero."" The father of first mate Shane Murphy on Saturday offered thanks for the ""tremendous outpouring"" of support his family has received from the public and government officials, including U.S. Sens. Ted Kennedy and John Kerry. Capt. Joseph Murphy told reporters the safe arrival of his son in Kenya is ""the best Easter present."" Joseph Murphy, an instructor at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, said he had spoken to his son but that he didn't have details on the standoff. ""He said, 'Dad, this has been unbelievable.' He said the facts will be known very soon. He said he couldn't speak about anything,"" Joseph Murphy said. ""I said this is going to be a tough sea story to overcome. He's got a great sea story here."" Joseph Murphy said Saturday that he and the Alabama crew's primary concern was for the ship's captain. ""He's made a tremendous sacrifice for his crew. Just incredible courage. We're very, very thankful. He's done everything he could possibly do and he has saved our son,"" he said at a news conference. ""We believe that Captain Phillips will survive the situation. We want him to know he has the support of all of us -- the American people and people around the world."" Phillips became a captive sometime during the hijacking Wednesday. Since then, the destroyer USS Bainbridge has arrived on the scene to try to free Phillips with the help of the FBI. An attempt by Phillips to escape from the 28-foot covered lifeboat was thwarted by a pirate who dove into the Indian Ocean after him. Phillips' captors appear to have tied him up afterward, Pentagon officials said. The Alabama resumed its course on Thursday for Mombasa, its original destination, carrying food aid and an armed 18-person security detail. Maersk president and CEO John Reinhart told reporters Saturday that the crew will stay on board in Mombasa while the FBI conducts an investigation.

"(CNN) -- The first nine months of this year has seen more pirate attacks than all of last year. And more than half of those attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates, an international maritime watchdog group said Wednesday. The increase in attacks has forced many countries to patrol pirate hotspots such as the Gulf of Aden. ""The increased activity in Somalia is the major reason for the spike,"" said Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes. From January 1 until September 30, pirates worldwide mounted 306 attacks, compared with 293 in all of 2008, the Bureau said. Of the incidents this year, Somali pirates accounted for 54 percent: they launched 168 attacks. Most of them took place off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia. They successfully hijacked 32 vessels and took 533 hostages. Eight others were wounded, four more killed and one is missing, the Bureau said. Somali pirates are still holding four ships for ransom with 80 crew members as hostages. Somalia's transitional government, which has a tenuous grip on power, has been unable to stop the pirates -- many of whom are based in the port cities. This has prompted Europe and other Western countries to step up maritime patrols. ""In the Gulf of Aden, the number of attacks have gone up. But because of the presence of naval vessels, the success rate of the pirates have decreased,"" Mody said. ""The navies are responding very very effectively."" Today's pirates are a far cry from the eye-patched, peg-legged swashbucklers of Hollywood. They don night-vision goggles, carry rocket launchers and navigate with global positioning devices. Many pirates are trained fighters; others are young thugs enlisted for the job. Experts say they often sail out to sea in a mother ship and wait for a target. When they find one, the pirates board smaller boats and move in, typically with five to seven armed hijackers per boat. Two recent trends have led to a rise in piracy: access and opportunity. As global commerce picks up, more and more of the world's fuels, minerals and other crucial commodities travel by ship. Ninety-five percent of America's foreign trade, for instance, moves by water, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. That cargo is an easy target for robbers in countries that lack the resources to secure their shorelines, such as Somalia. Those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in Somalia in the 1980s, when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast. Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms. Those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. With the ransoms they collect, pirates can earn up to $40,000 a year, analysts say. That's a fortune for someone from an impoverished country. Some analysts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the piracies. ""Yes, the ransoms have probably caused the piracy to become a bit more rampant. But at the same time, from the owner's point of view, there is no other way currently to secure the safe release of the vessel along with the crew and the cargo,"" Mody said. ""It's basically a cycle."" Other trouble spots this year were waters off Nigeria, with 20 attacks; Malaysia with 14; and Bangladesh with 12.","Somali pirates accounted for 54 percent of all attacks this year .

"(CNN) -- Until the abduction of more than 200 girls at the Government Girls Secondary School in rural Chibok, Nigeria's Boko Haram insurgency received scant attention in the global media, which gave it brief airtime when the insurgents exploded their bombs or torched a school. However, the mass abduction has brought the world's attention to the callous and unceasing violence that has become routine in northern Nigeria over the last three years. The area has suffered more than three decades of religious violence between Muslims and Christians. But since Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf was killed in a 2009 security crackdown -- along with hundreds of his followers -- the militant Islamist group has stepped up its attacks. Boko Haram militants have killed clerics, bombed churches and mosques and assassinated politicians and government officials. When the militants attack churches, their aim is to start a sectarian war that will engulf the country; when they attack mosques, their aim is to exterminate Muslims they consider collaborators. In the last three years, the Nigerian Government has opted for the use of force to exterminate the insurgents, rather than diminish the activities of the group -- and it has become more daring and audacious in its attacks. Despite the allocation of 25% of the annual budget to defense and security, the government has been unable to crush and contain the insurgency. The group has taken on and demoralized the rank and file of the Nigerian army and police. Boko Haram has launched deadly raids on military garrisons and police and secret intelligence offices to free their detained members. The use of force against the group has only led to allegations of a chain of rights abuses with the justification that it is a war on terror. Nigeria's Human Rights Commission last year accused the military of arbitrary killings, torture and rape in its campaign, while the military has described reports of civilian casualties as ""grossly exaggerated."" Our constitutional freedom has been formally suppressed by the authorities on the grounds of national emergency. The strategy of collective punishment, arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention and killing raids by the security forces has alienated the civil populace and turned them into victims. In the war against Boko Haram, civilians have become victims of both the military and the militants. Meeting with Boko Haram . I mooted the idea of dialogue with the insurgents as a new option towards ending the insurgency and restoring peace to my bewildered and beleaguered nation. In September 2011, I facilitated talks with the insurgents and the former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo -- then chairman of Nigeria's ruling party. READ MORE: Swap prisoners for kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls, ex-negotiator says . The first surprise in the encounter was that the representatives of the terror group spoke fluent English. The bigger surprise was when some of the insurgents revealed that they had university degrees. It is a prerequisite for new Boko Haram members to burn their university certificates or any paper identification that links them secular schools. In the meeting, they justified their violence on the grounds that it was the Nigerian Government that had forced them to take up arms. They said that before they trod the path of violence, they first tried to take the path of peace. They even showed us copies of a petition they wrote to the government complaining about the harassment and intimidation of their sect members by security forces before they picked up arms. They showed us photographs of followers and relatives they said had been killed by the police in cold blood, even before the insurgency began and threatened more attacks until they ""avenge the injustices done to them."" They expressed anger at the way people criticized and condemned them when they launched attacks but kept mute when Boko Haram members were killed, their homes demolished and their wives and children arrested by the security forces. We took their grievances to the government and advised the government to follow through, but hawks within the corridors of power discouraged the president from taking our advice. The second effort at dialogue involved a northern Islamic cleric and head of the Nigeria sharia council. The talks were facilitated by a freelance journalist who was later threatened by those opposed to dialogue. This second round of dialogue took place in the last quarter of 2012. Boko Haram accused the government of leaking the details of the talks to the media for political reasons. One of the group's conditions for talks had been that only their outcome be made public. We were close to achieving a ceasefire but again hawks, security and defense contractors in the corridors of power sabotaged our efforts. I have never met the Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau but I declined to meet him on two occasions when I got his invitation to interview him. I declined because I realized that the government was not interested in my approach. 'Preventable and avoidable' The abduction of the girls in Chibok is one of many abductions over the last three years. If the Nigerian authorities took lessons from earlier attacks on schools by the insurgents, the Chibok abductions couldn't have happened. The Chibok abduction was a preventable and avoidable tragedy. When the militants abduct boys, they use them as conscripts and girls as cooks and hostages. I cannot confirm if they used abducted girls as sex slaves -- the leadership of the group denied such reports when we asked them, but abducted women who were later freed give credence to such claims. Each day the Chibok girls spend in captivity keeps the moral flag of my country at half mast. The #BringBackOurGirls protest and the interest shown by President Obama and other world leaders and celebrities like Alicia Keys and Angelina Jolie has kept the spirits of Chibok mothers high and the Nigerian Government on its toes. When we were children, we used to forecast that one day the Sambisa forest in Borno state would become a game reserve which would attract foreign tourists and foreign currencies. Today it is attracting foreign interest for negative reasons. The Chibok girls must be freed but not by the use of force except when other options fail. The schoolgirls are now innocent hostages in the hands of soulless gunmen. We don't want the body of the girls to be brought back home, we want them back home alive. Political future . The use of force could turn out to be tragic. Experience has shown that attempts in the past to free hostages from the insurgents through the use of force has deadly consequences. French hostages were freed in Nigeria through negotiations but a British and Italian hostage were killed in Sokoto when UK forces went to free them. We can get the Chibok girls back home and we must. I was delighted to learn that the special team sent by the U.S. and UK also included experts in hostage negotiation. I strongly believe that Islamic clerics in northern Nigeria and some of the top ranking insurgents currently in detention can be used to open a channel of communication with the leadership of the sect in order to secure the release of the Chibok girls. There are those who say that the option of negotiating to free the hostages will embolden the terrorists, I have never been a hostage but I have been a political prisoner who spent many years in prison during our struggle against military dictatorship in Nigeria in the 1990s. Those who experience captivity appreciate freedom the most. The situation we find ourselves in is a tough moment in our history, but I believe we shall overcome it. Many Nigerians believe that the way the Chibok issue is resolved will determine the political future of Nigeria. Opinion: Nigerians right to be wary of U.S. intentions .

"(CNN) -- Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich is in federal custody on corruption charges, a law enforcement official said Tuesday. Rod Blagojevich is currently serving his second term as governor of Illinois. Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris, are charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and solicitation of bribery, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's office for the Northern District of Illinois. Both men are expected in U.S. District Court in Chicago later Tuesday. A news conference is expected at noon ET. Federal prosecutors say Blagojevich, Harris and others conspired to gain financial benefits in appointing President-elect Barack Obama's Senate replacement, according to  the statement. ""The breadth of corruption laid out in these charges is staggering,"" U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said in a statement. ""They allege that Blagojevich put a 'for sale' sign on the naming of a United States Senator; involved himself personally in pay-to-play schemes with the urgency of a salesman meeting his annual sales target; and corruptly used his office in an effort to trample editorial voices of criticism."" According to the statement, Blagojevich is alleged to have discussed obtaining: . The Obama transition team is aware that Blagojevich is in federal custody, but has no comment, according to a senior Democratic source. The statement also alleges that Blagojevich and others tried to illegally obtain campaign contributions. Blagojevich, Harris and others are also alleged to have withheld state assistance to the Tribune Company in connection with the sale of Wrigley Field. The statement says this was done to induce the firing of Chicago Tribune editorial board members who were critical of Blagojevich. Blagojevich, who turns 52 on Wednesday, is in his second four-year term as Illinois governor. His term ends in January 2011. Before being elected governor, he served as a U.S. congressman for Illinois' 5th district from 1997 until 2003, according to his online biography. He and his wife, Patti, have two daughters. Blagojevich announced last month that he was forming a panel to review candidates to fill Obama's Senate seat. Several Illinois Democrats -- including Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth, a former congressional candidate who now serves in Blagojevich's administration -- have been mentioned as possible Senate replacements for Obama.","Gov.

"(CNN) -- It is always risky to make predictions about the Supreme Court's decisions based on what is or is not said by lawyers and justices at oral argument. It is also almost impossible to resist the temptation to hunt through the transcripts for clues and tea leaves. On Wednesday, the justices heard arguments in a case called Town of Greece v. Galloway, which involves a challenge to a small New York town's practice of opening its board meetings with short prayers, delivered by volunteers. A lower federal court ruled last year that the town of Greece's prayers -- but not necessarily all legislative prayers -- violate the First Amendment's rule against ""establishments"" of religion. Arguing for those challenging the prayer was one of the most respected legal scholars in America, Douglas Laycock. As his argument time was running down, Justice Elena Kagan -- one of the two justices nominated by President Obama -- shared an interesting and revealing observation. She emphasized how important it is to ""maintain a multireligious society in a peaceful and harmonious way"" and then added, ""every time the court gets involved in things like this, it seems to make the problem worse rather than better."" A clue? Perhaps. The Supreme Court's decisions and doctrines about church-state relations, religious liberty, and the role of faith in public life are regularly criticized as unpredictable and unprincipled. Why, for example, is a large Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol acceptable while a display in a Kentucky courthouse that includes a framed copy of the Ten Commandments is not? Why did the justices permit a Rhode Island city's Christmas display, which included a creche, but disapprove Pittsburgh's, which did also. To many observers, the court's rulings seem to have done more to cause discord and dissonance than -- borrowing Kagan's words -- peace and harmony and, at Wednesday's session, many of the justices appeared to share her concern. Over and again, they pressed the attorneys to identify clear lines and straightforward rules that courts, legislators and citizens might use to separate permissible religious solemnizations from unconstitutional religious establishments. It would be clear and straightforward, of course, to say the Constitution bans all officially sponsored prayers at government meetings and functions. However, to say this would also conflict glaringly with American history and traditions, going back to the founding. In fact, one of the first things the first Congress did when it assembled in 1789 was to select chaplains for the House and the Senate. This is why, 30 years ago, in the case of Marsh v. Chambers, the court held that legislative prayers offered by a paid chaplain did not violate the First Amendment and it is probably also why none of the justices indicated that he or she is inclined, at this late date, to change course so dramatically. Nor did a majority of the justices seem inclined to treat volunteer-led prayers at town board meetings like potentially coercive invocations at public school graduations and football games. One suggestion to the justices was that legislative prayers be ""nonsectarian"" and avoid religious issues and theological claims on which there is significant disagreement. Several of the justices appeared to agree that this would be a sensible policy. At the same time, most were leery of making this good practice a constitutional requirement, of forcing trial court judges into the tricky and delicate business of parsing and perusing prayers, or of policing a line between allowable prayers that invoke ""almighty God"" and over-the-line ones that address ""Jesus Christ."" Our country is, as Kagan noted, a ""multireligious society"" and so it is both unsurprising and unavoidable that Americans sometimes disagree about the role and place of religious faith in our public life. It is just as much a fact about our country that, from the very beginning, we have tried to respect religious faith and protect religious liberty, in private and in public. Our tradition and practice has not been to regard public acknowledgments of religion and public requests for divine guidance as inconsistent with our founders' wise decision to distinguish between, or ""separate,"" church and state. A decision by the court to uphold the town board's prayers in Greece will probably not clear up all the questions about or patch up all the holes in the court's First Amendment case law. However, such a decision, one that relies on precedent and avoids any dramatic changes in direction, will avoid making things worse. And, as Kagan reminded us, that is no small thing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard Garnett.","Supreme Court hears case challenging prayer at town board meeting .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Western Europe was dealing with the aftermath of violent weather Monday after a winter storm dubbed ""Xynthia"" battered at least six countries, leaving at least 58 people dead, authorities said. Hardest hit was France, where at least 47 people were killed, according to the Interior Ministry. French President Nicolas Sarkozy visited the departments of Charente-Maritime and Vendee on the nation's west coast Monday, where the extra-tropical cyclone hit. ""It's a national catastrophe,"" French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said Sunday. ""Many people drowned, surprised by the rapid rise of the water."" The combination of hurricane-force winds and high tide inundated parts of the coastal region. ""It was rushing in, it broke down the walls around the garden and the gate,"" a resident of Aiguillon-Sur-Mer, in the department of Vendee, told CNN affiliate BFM-TV. Hundreds of people had to be rescued from their rooftops overnight. Were you affected? Send your pics, videos to iReport. ""The water was up to the gutters,"" said one woman, who spent the night on the roof with her children. By Monday rescuers in boats and helicopters continued to search to find the missing in homes overrun by flooding, Agence France-Press said. Residents of the village of Aytre, in Charente-Maritime, saw a wave of water measuring one-meter high come into the center of town. ""It was unreal,"" Aytre Mayor Suzanne Tallard told BFM-TV. At least 500,00 households were without power Monday morning, said Electricite de France. The utility said all power should be restored by Wednesday. President Sarkozy said he was making €3 million ($4 million) of emergency funds available for the victims and promised that electricity would be restored by Tuesday, AFP reported. The agency added that the European Union was ready to offer support for the countries affected. French Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux told the affiliate that 350 soldiers and 3,250 firefighters have been mobilized to assist in the aftermath. The high winds -- at times spiking to 200 km/h (124 mph) -- reached inland as far as Paris. Gusts of up to 175 km/h (108 mph) were measured at the top of the Eiffel Tower on Saturday, said Eboni Deon, CNN meteorologist . As many as 100 flights were canceled at the Paris-Charles de Gaulle International Airport on Sunday because of the blustery conditions, the affiliate reported. All major French airports were back to normal schedules Monday. A the storm's peak, Hurricane-strength winds stretched from Portugal northeast to the Netherlands. The storm killed five people in Germany, officials said. Four of them died after being hit by falling trees. A fifth, a 2-year-old boy near the town of Biblis, drowned when he was blown into a river. Train service was slowly returning to normal in Germany on Monday after massive disruptions and a partial shutdown of services in the states of North Rhine-Westfalia, Baden-Wuerttemberg, and Hesse a day earlier, railway Deutsche Bahn reported. Crews spent the overnight hours clearing tracks of debris. In Spain, at least three people were killed by the storm, Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Sunday. Two children died in a car accident and one more person was killed in northwestern Spain, the minister said in a news conference on CNN sister station CNN+. A 10-year-old child was killed by a falling tree in the high winds in Portugal, said Patricia Gaspar, national operations assistant with the Portuguese National Authority for Civil Protection. There are also some power outages in the country, Gaspar said. Some residents have reported roofs blown off and smaller houses collapsing, she added. A man was killed by a falling tree in Belgium, Peter Mertens, a spokesman for Belgium's Interior Ministry, said. Eastern Belgium saw the worst of the storm, Mertens said. ""They've had problems with fallen trees, roofs blown off and electricity cables not working. But it seems the worst part has passed now,"" he added. The storm also reached England, where one woman was reported dead when the vehicle she was driving became submerged and washed down a swollen creek in the northeastern part of the country. The body of the 53-year-old woman was recovered downstream, North Yorkshire Police said in a phone message to the media. CNN's Al Goodman in Madrid, Spain; Per Nyberg in London, England; Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin, Germany; and Estelle Eonnet and Lorraine Gublin in Paris contributed to this report.","At least 55 deaths from extra-tropical cyclone, 45 of them in France .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- If you're wary of chicken and beef products after a major meat supply scandal in Asia, the McDonald's in Japan could have an alternative for you -- tofu and fish nuggets. On Wednesday, McDonald's in Japan rolled out Tofu Shinjo McNuggets, a doppelganger of the Chicken McNugget made from a mishmash of minced white fish, tofu and vegetables including edamame, soy beans and carrots. Deep-fried to a golden-brown and shaped just like the original chicken version, the Tofu Shinjo McNugget is crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. The fast food chain is known for adding dishes with local flavor to its menu; for instance McDonald's India has the McAloo Tikki sandwich which caters to vegetarian patrons with its potato and peas patty, and gazpacho in Spain. Tofu Shinjo McNuggets are available from July 30 to early September only in Japan. The country's unit of McDonald's says the tofu and fish nuggets were planned as part of McDonald's summer products, long before the China meat scandal broke. Last week, a video surfaced in Chinese media, showing appalling practices in a Shanghai food-processing factory that supplies ingredients to many international restaurant brands including McDonald's, Starbucks and Yum Brands. Workers at the Chinese subsidiary of Illinois-based OSI Group said that the meat smelled bad, and they could be seen in the footage processing meat that had fallen on the floor. Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration subsequently found that expired beef and chicken products were processed and repackaged with new expiration dates at the plant. The tainted meat supply from the food processing plant of Shanghai Husi Food, has been found to reach across China, all the way to Hong Kong, and to Japan -- where it affected 20% of their meat for chicken nuggets triggering sporadic shortages over the weekend. By Monday, McDonald's Japan restored most of its chicken products by getting supplies from Thailand. But it may run out of chicken products for its Chick Crisp Muffin and Chicken Egg Muffin, the company told CNN. On Tuesday, McDonald's Japan CEO Sarah Casanova apologized and promised to strengthen food safety measures, including more transparency in the country of origin for its products. The fast food chain in Japan said it will fall short of profits and sales targets after its longtime meat supplier was shut down.

"(CNN) -- In our country, lawyers and judges regulate their own markets. The upshot is that getting legal help is enormously expensive and out of reach for the vast majority of Americans. Anyone faced with a contract dispute, family crisis, foreclosure or eviction must pay a lawyer with a JD degree to provide service one-on-one in the same way lawyers have done business for hundreds of years. Increasingly, the only ""persons"" with access to legal help are ""artificial persons"" -- corporations, organizations and governments. No wonder that in a 2010 New York study, it was shown 95% of people in housing court are unrepresented. The same is true in consumer credit and child support cases; 44% of people in foreclosures are representing themselves—against a well-represented bank, no small number of whom engaged in robo-signing and sued people based on faulty information. These numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. For every person who is unrepresented in court there are probably tens of thousands who didn't have any legal advice when they did the things that landed them in hot water in the first place. Who can afford $200 to $300 an hour to get advice on local small business regulations, the fine print in a mortgage document, or how not to make mistakes that will cost you in court when fighting over kids and money with your soon-to-be ex-spouse? Some legal professionals have called for more public money for legal aid clinics and courts to provide free legal help and for lawyers to do more pro bono work. But the demand for ordinary legal help is simply too massive to meet with increased court funding, legal aid or pro bono work. I believe there is no way to help ordinary people with their legal problems without fundamentally changing the way lawyers and judges regulate the practice of law. What we need are more efficient ways of delivering legal help and less expensive nonlawyers who can provide legal assistance. Supreme court judges in every state have the authority to accomplish this with the stroke of a pen. The root of the crisis of access to justice is the scale of the problem. Here's a little back-of-the-envelope arithmetic. Using data from surveys conducted by the ABA and state bar associations, I estimate that, at any given time, roughly half of all American households are dealing with about two legal problems each-- evictions, divorces, bankruptcies, denials of health care benefits, and so on. Giving these American households just one hour of help from a lawyer to manage a maze of legal documents and court procedures would cost close to $20 billion. This doesn't even consider the cost of what clients want most from lawyers -- advice about how to avoid legal problems. Including this service would add additional tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars. That's why the only way to increase access to justice is to expand the group of people and organizations that can provide legal help beyond JD-trained and licensed lawyers. Authorized nonlawyers and organizations could help ease our overburdened courts in many ways. Each year, 2.3 million New Yorkers, for example, represent themselves in state courts. These litigants do not want to be in court or to manage their problems alone, but have no other practical choice. They frequently labor under huge misunderstandings about legal procedures, requirements and forms. Oodles of judges and lawyers have complained about the delays and complications these misunderstandings create. Imagine how much more efficient the court would be if the unrepresented could obtain low-cost legal assistance from people expert enough to help them navigate the process. Especially if those people were using the systems and protocols developed by a large-scale company, maybe even online. It doesn't take high-level legal expertise to advise a person facing eviction for unpaid rent that if she wants to contend that her apartment has no heating and the ceiling is falling down, she should bring some photographs or other evidence to court to back up her claim. The same applies to people who need to understand what the arcane legal language in a court order or rule means. There are many basic issues that could be handled by nonlawyers. Allowing nonlawyers to work for businesses that invest and specialize in giving this kind of help would supercharge the potential for reducing the cost of legal help. The use of non-JD legal assistants and nonlawyer dominated businesses is not a venture into uncharted waters. The United Kingdom has a long history of allowing a wide variety of differently trained individuals and organizations provide legal assistance, and studies show that the practice works very well. In many cases, people are better served by a nonlawyer organization that specializes in a particular type of legal help—navigating housing or bankruptcy matters, for example—than they are by a solo practitioner with a general practice. Furthermore, when people have access to lower-cost alternatives to full-fledged attorneys, they use these resources. In practical terms, that means that only 5% to 10% ignore their legal issues in the United Kingdom. Compare that to New York, where significant majorities of low-income households with legal problems—65% with housing problems, 59% with financial issues, 50% with health insurance problems—do nothing in response to their problems. But as often is the case, untreated problems lead to worse problems—and bigger headaches for our courts. For too long, the legal profession has focused on legal aid, pro bono and charitable assistance as the solution to the crisis in access to justice. The approach is admirable, but futile. Solving the problem requires lawyers—especially those on the bench who bear the ultimate responsibility for regulating the profession—to share the field with other, less-expensive, non-JD professionals and nonlawyer dominated organizations who can provide perfectly adequate legal help in many cases. America's legal profession is in dire need of reform; it's time for those in leadership positions to step up. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gillian Hadfield.","Gillian Hadfield: Getting legal help is enormously expensive in the U.S.

The energetic, long-legged youngster lives with his mom, Adia, and spends his days prancing around his yard in the Antelope & Zebra Area. Gat and Lita, Cheetahs, Smithsonian National Zoological Park, Washington, D.C. Gat and Lita came into the world, this spring, under harrowing circumstances. Their mother, Ally, 5, birthed Gat, then underwent a cesarean section to deliver three more cubs, but only one, Lita, survived. Mom and the two cubs spent several days afterwards in intensive care and have since fully recovered—and bonded. Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, and because they were born in an Olympics year, the cubs were named after the speediest American man and woman at the London Games. ""Gat the Cat"" takes his name from Justin Gatlin, who won bronze in the men's 100-meter sprint, and ""Lita the Cheetah"" was named after Carmelita Jeter, who won silver in the women's 100 meters. Bexley, Matschie's Tree Kangaroo, Saint Louis Zoo . Though he was born in early 2012, Bexley, a Matschie's tree kangaroo, only recently started venturing from his mother's pouch to walk around and explore. As he gets bigger, the furry marsupial will be able to jump great distances, too—tree kangaroos, native to Papua New Guinea, can leap as much as 30 feet, from a treetop to the ground. Amur Tigers, Columbus Zoo, Ohio . Mara, 5, and Foli, 9, became the parents of two male cubs in June 2012. They weighed just two to three pounds apiece and were placed into intensive care when one did not nurse for a dangerously long time. Luckily, the two youngsters are now healthy and living together in their habitat. The orange-and-black-striped cuties are still waiting on their names (the rights to name them were recently auctioned off at a zoo fundraiser), but in the meantime, they're happy to pass their days eating, dozing, and exploring their surroundings. Southern Hairy-Nosed Wombat, Brookfield Zoo, Illinois . This little one emerged from her mom's pouch so recently that, as of November 2012, she has yet to receive a name. The Brookfield Zoo's female wombat is the fourth child of 12-year-old Kambora, who was born at the San Diego Zoo, and the second of Wilbur, 20, from Australia, the native country of wombats. This rambunctious baby lives at the Brookfield Zoo's Australia House and likes staying close to mom—sometimes even clambering onto her back. T+L: The world's strangest animals . Qinisa, Elephant, San Diego Zoo Safari Park . This playful elephant calf is hitting developmental milestones faster than any other pachyderm at San Diego Safari Park; at one week old, she was already using her trunk to pick up objects. Maybe it was only natural for a baby whose name means ""to act with determination"" in Siswati. Qinisa's mom, Swazi, was one of four elephants who were rescued from a game park in Swaziland in 2003. Karoo, Black-Footed Cat, Brookfield Zoo, Illinois . Love cats? Then you'll swoon for Karoo, the Brookfield Zoo's big-eyed black-footed cat. The species is the smallest of all the African felines; grown black-footed cats are about half the size of your average domestic tabby. Like most felines, Karoo spends lots of time catnapping, but when he's awake, he's up and about and curious about his human guests. Adelina, Western Lowland Gorilla, Little Rock Zoo, Arkansas . One could say that Adelina is Arkansas's most popular primate. After she was born from mom Sekani, 21, and dad Fossey, 26, the western lowland gorilla received her very own baby shower, complete with a Target registry that allowed zoogoers to buy her gifts, such as blankets and dried fruit. Adelina also has her own Facebook page, where fans can keep up with her whereabouts. View the rest of the gallery . Planning a getaway?

"(CNN) -- What have unions done for us lately? Other than give us Labor Day, and a three-day weekend to start football season. The answers may surprise you. Unions have long been part of our nation's history, fighting for better pay, safer working conditions, health care and retirement benefits, education and civic participation. Unions have brought diverse voices together, and their struggles have elevated the working conditions, the standard of living and the recognition of not just their members, but of all who labor. Unions played a major role in ending the sweatshops and child labor so common at the beginning of the 20th century. The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, or ILGWU, was one of the first unions to have a primarily female membership. And in the aftermath of the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, in which more than 100 mostly young immigrant women were killed, the ILGWU was at the forefront of reforming working conditions and pushing for comprehensive safety and workers' compensation laws. Unions aren't a ""thing of the past."" They're a vital part of our social fabric and economic future. Did you know, for example, that unions run the largest career training program outside the military? Union apprenticeship programs generally partner with employers or industries to provide the kind of training that hard-wires excellence into workers and places them in good jobs that can support families. That's worth a lot when unemployment is stubbornly high and personal incomes are falling. I challenge you to watch this quick video about union-trained military vets who are rebuilding the World Trade Center without getting misty-eyed. Did you know that union letter carriers save lives all the time by alerting officials when an elderly person hasn't collected her mail from the mailbox? That firefighters are fighting breast cancer? That in Erie, Pennsylvania, union members arranged haircuts for more than 700 kids going back to school? In just about every community, the union movement partners with the United Way, and together they do amazing things -- from cleaning up after storms to building wheelchair ramps and running food banks. Unions have had their problems -- what organizations do not? -- and it's convenient for some politicians to belittle the contribution or usefulness of unions. Indeed, much of the public has lost touch with what unions do and who they are. Unions are just folks -- people who come together to improve their lives and their workplaces, because there's strength in numbers. The one thing the public does know is that union members, thanks to collective bargaining, have higher wages and better benefits. But union membership actually raises living and working standards for all working men and women -- union and non-union. When union membership rates are high, so is the share of income that goes to the middle class. When those rates fall, income inequality grows -- the middle class shrinks and the 1% gets richer. Collective bargaining affects more than wages and benefits. Union teachers bargain for smaller class sizes. Union nurses bargain for better patient care. When they're successful -- when they're not shut down by Scott Walker-type governors -- we all win. Working together, union members and their community allies also make up a powerful lobby for the common good. They've helped secure for us all the eight-hour day, job safety laws, overtime pay, Medicare and Social Security, civil rights protections, fair treatment for women and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers and much more. These are some of the reasons even people who don't fit the stereotypes of union members have formed unions. Rocket scientists. Architects. Taxi drivers in New York, who are getting health care for the first time. Carwash workers in Los Angeles. Professional athletes. Writers and directors for TV shows. Go to a movie and you're enjoying the work of one of America's most unionized industries, from the actors and camera crews to set designers. But maybe the most important contribution of unions has to do with basic dignity. Memphis, Tennessee, sanitation workers, aspiring to become American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees members, picked up signs that declared proudly, ""I Am a Man,"" and formed the setting for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I've Been to the Mountaintop"" speech. One of the core tenets of unionism is that all work has dignity. All work deserves respect. And all the people who perform it deserve respect. So even as Labor Day weekend recedes, say ""thank you"" to someone whose work you respect and rely on. And thank a union for the weekend while you're at it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: Unions have done much to improve the lives of most Americans .

"(CNN) -- The man labeled the most powerful vice president in American history remains resolute in his steadfast defense of his time in the White House in a new documentary that begins airing Friday. ""I did what I did. It's all on the public record, and I feel very good about it. If I had to do it over again, I'd do it in a minute,"" Dick Cheney says in ""The World According to Dick Cheney,"" which debuts at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime. The two-hour documentary tells the story of Cheney's life through his own comments, supplemented by a narrator and interviews with journalists, biographers, former aides and his longtime friend and mentor Donald Rumsfeld, the former secretary of Defense. While the film covers Cheney's unprecedented and controversial role as vice president, the first half of the film explores the surprising tale of his rise from a two-time Yale dropout with two drunk-driving arrests to the man who once stood behind the leader of the free world. In ""The World According to Dick Cheney,"" produced by R.J. Cutler — also known for ""The War Room"" and ""The September Issue"" -- the former Washington powerhouse gets personal, but he still maintains his ever-steady, matter-of-fact tone. ""When you came in at night after work, you'd go to the bar and down large quantities of Coors beer,"" he stated coolly, referring to the two times he was arrested for drinking and driving in his home state of Wyoming. Noticeably absent from the documentary are details about Cheney's post-White House life. The 72-year-old gives little to no insight about his heart transplant last year or his decision to support same-sex marriage. His younger daughter Mary wed her longtime partner Heather Poe in June. Cheney to co-author 'medical memoir' Cheney talks about growing up in spacious Wyoming during the 1950s, a simpler time, as he describes it. He met his wife, Lynne, to whom he's still married, in high school. He was the senior class president; she was a state champion baton twirler. Awarded a scholarship to Yale, Cheney left his comfort zone to find a ""totally different environment"" in New Haven. He flunked out twice and never finished his sophomore year. He returned home to work as a manual laborer and lay electrical cables. Following his arrests and feeling no sense of direction, he received an ultimatum from Lynne: She wasn't going to marry someone in his condition. That did the trick. Pressed by his interviewer for more details of the conversation, Cheney said the content remains ""private."" He decided to go back to school to study political science at the University of Wyoming, and 12 years later at the age of 34 Cheney became the youngest person to hold the position of White House chief of staff in the Gerald Ford administration. His ticket to the remarkable transition was a job with then-Rep. Rumsfeld. The two clicked and remained close as they shuffled through different White House positions. After avoiding the Watergate controversy that took down President Richard Nixon, their careers quickly escalated under Ford, with Rumsfeld becoming Defense secretary and Cheney becoming chief of staff. Filmmaker discusses time spent with Cheney . The documentary continues to tick through Cheney's resume of 40 years in public service, much of which is already well known. He represented Wyoming in Congress for 10 years. President George H.W. Bush picked Cheney as Defense secretary, and he helped lead Operation Desert Storm in Kuwait and Iraq in 1991. When President Bill Clinton took office, he sought out on his own journey for the White House, traveling thousands of miles in a car to gauge whether there was support for his potential bid. ""I thought that I was qualified by background of experience to do the job. I believed I could function effectively as president,"" Cheney says in the film. Despite raising money and forming a political action committee, he never surpassed 3% in pre-election polls. Cheney dropped the idea. He then retired to private life as the CEO of energy services company Haliburton for five years, but he felt a new calling when then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush asked him to lead his search for a vice presidential candidate. ""Cheney really never extinguished his political ambitions,"" veteran journalist and editor Bob Woodward says in the film. ""He always said he did, maybe in his own mind he did. Once you're a political animal, you know where the big seat in the zoo is, and it's being president of the United States."" Cheney's scrupulous vetting ultimately ended in one request from Bush: He wanted Cheney, himself, as his running mate for the 2000 election. Not long after that, he was back at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., an all too familiar place. ""When I had first arrived (at the White House) back in 1968, I was one of the youngest people in the West Wing,"" Cheney says. ""And this time around, I was the oldest."" Narrated by actor Dennis Haysbert — famous for his Allstate commercials and his role as president on the former TV series ""24"" — the second half of the documentary zips through the Bush administration. It starts with the terrorist attacks on September 11 and jogs through the lead-up to the Iraq War and all the controversies — the I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby trial, the warrantless wiretapping program, torture scandals — that surrounded it. ""It was a wartime situation, and it does require tough programs and policies if you're going to be successful,"" Cheney says. ""It was more important to be successful than it was to be loved."" He also staunchly defends the infamous waterboarding technique used to mimic the sensation of drowning on detainees being interrogated. ""Tell me what terrorist attack you would have let go forward because you didn't want to be a mean and nasty fellow,"" he says to Cutler, the film's creator. ""Are you going to trade the lives of a number of people because you want to preserve your honor?"" Cheney gained a reputation for his zealous quest to prevent another terrorist attack on American soil — a reputation that had sharp critics and steadfast supporters. But after Bush's re-election in 2004, a divide was growing between the president and Cheney as the administration faced a declining sense of patience among the public for the Iraq War and negative headlines over prisoner abuse. In 2006, Bush forced Rumsfeld's resignation, despite strong disagreement from Cheney. ""The way that history works, you don't get a lot of credit for what didn't happen,"" Cheney says, referring to Rumsfeld's departure. ""This is one of those kinds of situations. It isn't so much what you achieved, as is what you prevented. Now you've safeguarded against further attacks against the U.S. I think that's a major accomplishment."" The split between the president and his No. 2 deepened when Bush refused to pardon Libby, Cheney's chief of staff, after a federal court convicted him of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators in the probe of the leak of the name of a CIA operative. ""I pushed very hard for a pardon. I thought a pardon was appropriate,"" Cheney says, adding the disagreement became a ""major strain"" on their relationship and a ""source of considerable friction"" through the remainder of Bush's second term. The splintered relationship continues to this day, the film says. For his part, Cheney remains as satisfied as ever with his performance as vice president — and doesn't look back. ""I don't run around thinking, 'Gee, I wish we had done this or wish we had done that.' The world is as you find it, and you've got to deal with that,"" he says. ""You get one shot. You don't get do-overs. So you don't spend a lot of time thinking about it.""","The two-hour documentary tells the story of Cheney's life through his own comments .

"(CNN) -- When faced with the most ferocious waves on the planet, most people would seek protection in the largest, sturdiest vessel they could find. But when Swedish pensioner Sven Yrvind sets out on his ambitious mission to circumnavigate the globe, it won't be in a hefty ship piled high with food, creature comforts and telecommunications equipment. Instead, the 73-year-old plans to traverse the high seas cocooned in a sailboat only slightly bigger than a bathtub. For many, the proposition of sailing non-stop around the world for a year-and-a-half in a vessel just three meters-long will sound rather ambitious, and coming from a man well past the retirement age, downright far-fetched. Indeed, few would likely take the idea seriously were Yrvind not one of the world's most respected boat-builders. During his accomplished life he has given lectures to the Swedish king and queen and received awards from the prestigious Royal Cruising Club in Britain, among others. ""People have said it's a suicide mission,"" said Yrvind. ""But a big boat is actually more dangerous than a small one. You've got bigger forces throwing you around -- a bigger engine, a bigger beam, a bigger deck. ""My small boat is like a little capsule -- nothing can happen to you. It's like throwing a bottle in the water -- it will capsize, it will pitchpole (somersault), but it will always come back up,"" he added. If successful, Yrvind will make history for sailing the smallest boat around the world without docking on land. The record is currently held by Italian Alessandro di Benedetto, who in 2010 circumnavigated the globe in a 6.5 meter yacht -- more than double the size of Yrvind's creation. Yrvind, from the small village of Vastervik in south east Sweden, started building the ground-breaking vessel in March. Now half-complete, he is reluctant to put a time on its launch. Click on the pindrops above to trace Sven Yrvind's proposed circumnavigation route. Named Yrvind Ten after its 10 foot length, the miniature vessel will be just 1.8 meters wide with two six meter-tall masts. Weighing 1.5 tons, it will be made out of a composite foam and fiberglass material which, he says, is ""excellent for insulation and floatation."" Powered by wind, solar panels, gel batteries and a foot crank, Yrvind Ten will set sail from Ireland in a 48,000 kilometer return journey around the globe. Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to sail around the world in 1969 in a 9.8 meter yacht, said there was a real possibility Yrvind would complete the voyage. Briton Knox-Johnston, who also founded the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race, added that many people had thought his own bid to circumnavigate the globe was impossible at the time. ""One of the biggest challenges he'll face is when he's coming up against these massive 25 meter waves in the Southern Ocean. In a boat that size he's just going to be rolled around and around like he's inside a giant washing machine,"" Knox-Johnston said. ""He might also find he's using a lot more energy -- and will need a lot more food -- being rolled around like that."" The Swede will collect rainwater in sails, funneled by a hose to a tank. With no heating equipment on board, he'll rely on 400 kilograms of muesli and sardines, supplemented with vitamin tablets and fish caught from the sea. ""I need just half-a-kilogram of food a day and this will give me enough food for 800 days,"" he said. ""In the beginning I will have fruit but obviously that will run out. I also have a friend in Melbourne with a boat who will come out with supplies."" The self-described ""recluse"" plans to spend his days swimming, philosophizing and reading more than 400 books, which weigh around 100 kilograms. ""On land, people are watching TV, driving cars in traffic, smoking, drinking -- it's not healthy,"" Yrvind explained. ""Out at sea it's a cleaner environment -- mentally and physically. When I come back I will be a healthier, younger person. This will prolong my life, not the other way around."" Growing up on the small Swedish island of Branno in the North Sea, Yrvind quickly learned to sail in an area so remote he needed to cross water simply to buy a loaf of bread from the shop. In his 50-year career building boats, Yrvind has been lavished with awards from around the world. In 1980 he received a Seamanship Medal from the Royal Cruising Club in Britain for single-handedly sailing a six meter boat around the stormy waters of Cape Horn, Chile. Eight years later he was inducted into the Museum of Yachting's Hall of Fame, based in Newport, Rhode Island, for his many single-handed expeditions. The museum also has one of Yrvind's boats on permanent display -- a six meter yacht he built in his mother's basement and sailed from Sweden to Newport in 1983. In 1989 Yrvind also built and sailed a 4.5 meter boat from France to Newfoundland, now on display at the Swedish National Maritime Museum in Stockholm. And the sprightly septuagenarian is no closer to slowing down -- last year sailing a tiny 4.5 meter-long boat from Ireland to the Caribbean. Yrvind, who is also on the look-out for sponsorship, hopes his boat will not simply break the record books, but pave the way for a new environmentally-friendly design for living. ""We are on Earth living beyond our resources -- oil is running out, fossil fuels are running out, water is running out,"" he said. ""If I can show I can live on a boat 10 foot-long for more than a year, with all the food I need with me, I think it might benefit mankind."" For a man who ""loves all things small,"" should he accomplish the feat it would be a huge achievement in the history of sailing.","73-year-old man plans to sail around world in world's smallest boat .

"(CNN) -- A person who is brain dead may appear alive -- there may be a heartbeat, they may look like they're breathing, their skin may still be warm to the touch. But doctors say there is no life when brain activity ceases. Doctors in Oakland, California, declared 13-year-old Jahi McMath to be brain dead on December 12, three days after she underwent a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. The McMath family fought in court to keep the teen on a ventilator, and announced Monday that they had moved the girl to another care facility. While family attorney Christopher Dolan told reporters that for her safety, Jahi's destination won't be announced, a New York facility said Sunday it was ready to accept her. ""We are aware of Jahi McMath's dire situation, and we are willing to open our outpatient facility to provide 24-hour care,"" said Allyson Scerri, founder of New Beginnings Community Center in Medford, New York. ""Her brain needs time to heal."" ""This child has been defined as a deceased person yet she has all the functional attributes of a living person despite her brain injury,"" the center said on its website. When routine surgeries go wrong . However, barring a misdiagnosis, medical experts say the teen will not recover if she is truly ""brain dead."" While laymen tend to use the words ""coma"" and ""brain dead"" interchangeably, in medicine they mean very different things. ""Coma"" is the broader term used to describe a prolonged state of unconsciousness, according to the Mayo Clinic. Outwardly, it resembles sleep. Doctors may sometimes purposefully put a patient into a coma to give the brain time to heal. Comas rarely last longer than a couple of weeks, according to the clinic; patients can fully regain consciousness or may transition from a coma into a persistent vegetative state. Someone in a persistent vegetative state has lost most higher cognitive function, but his or her brain shows some activity. The patient may open their eyes or exhibit small movements, but cannot speak or respond to commands, according to the National Institutes of Health. Some patients can recover from this state, according to the NIH. Both these situations are different from brain death: According to the Uniform Determination of Death Act, an individual is dead when he or she ""has sustained either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem."" What that essentially means is that the brain, an extremely complex organ, no longer helps the patient function. The human brain is divided into what doctors call the Lower Brain and the Upper Brain. The Lower Brain -- where the top of the spinal cord goes up through our necks and into our brains -- regulates body functions such as spontaneous breath, reflexes, our heartbeat, body temperature and sleep/wake cycles. The Upper Brain is behind all the ""higher"" functions in a person's nervous system. This gives us the ability to use our senses -- to see, taste, smell, hear and feel. ""Brain death"" means both the upper and lower part of the brain are not functioning. That command center of the body that regulates the central nervous system is unable to perform. However, some function, such as a heartbeat, may linger. ""It's a little difficult for a layperson to understand how a person is dead if the heart is still beating,"" said Dr. Panayiotis Varelas, director of the neurosciences intensive care service at Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital. But without brain function, the body eventually shuts down, unless there is medical intervention. Someone on a ventilator may appear to be breathing, but cannot breathe on their own. While the heart usually stops within 72 hours, it could continue beating for ""a week or so,"" Varelas said. Jahi's mother, Nailah Winkfield, has said, ""I would probably need for my child's heart to stop to show me that she was dead. Her heart is still beating, so there's still life there."" The term ""brain dead"" can be misleading, said Cynda Hylton Rushton, professor of clinical ethics at Johns Hopkins University, because it sounds like a person really isn't dead. If someone dies of a heart attack, doctors don't say they're ""cardiovascular dead,"" for example. Doctors should be more transparent about the finality of brain death, said Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center. Terms such as ""mechanical support"" or ""artificial machine support"" should be used to refer to sustaining the functioning of a brain dead person, he said. ""No one wants to take away 'life support.'"" ""Dead is dead,"" agreed neurologist Dr. Richard Senelick in The Atlantic. ""Brain death isn't a different type of death, and patients who meet the criteria of brain death are legally dead."" The American Academy of Neurology updated its brain death guidelines for adults in 2010, asking doctors to follow a step-by-step checklist of some 25 tests. All criteria in the guidelines must be met before a person can be considered brain dead; however, the legal definition of brain death can vary from state to state. The American Academy of Pediatrics added to those guidelines for children. These childrens' guidelines advise there should be two attending physicians involved in the care of the child, and they should make separate examinations separated by an observation period. Both must determine the child is brain dead. In making that ruling, the doctors use the currently established criteria; there must not be a conflict of interest. ""No one who has met the criteria for brain death has ever survived,"" Senelick said. ""No one."" CNN's Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.","Doctors declared Jahi McMath, 13, brain dead on December 12 .

"(CNN) -- It's hard for today's generation to imagine watching TV in the 1960s -- there was no TiVo or DVR (or even VCR). You watched what the networks put on and that was it. And oh yeah, there were only three channels. Yet television made some groundbreaking advancements in this decade as we learned from this week's episode of ""The Sixties,"" and here are a few of them: . 1. Television becomes a political force . By 1960, most American households had a television, and that year's Nixon/Kennedy debate was the first televised presidential debate. For many Americans, it was their first introduction to John F. Kennedy. When Kennedy was approached about the idea of debating his political opponent on television, he agreed immediately. Kennedy was comfortable on-camera and sure he'd win. Nixon, however, began to sweat during the televised debate, and the American people began to doubt him. No one realized just how much TV mattered until after those 1960 debates. Later that election season, Kennedy appeared as a guest on NBC's ""The Jack Parr Tonight Show""; and when Nixon ran for president again in 1968, he made a brief appearance on the sketch comedy show ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In"" and uttered the show's famous catchphrase, ""Sock it to me."" It was the first time a presidential candidate had appeared on a comedy show. For the rest of his life, Nixon maintained that his appearance on ""Laugh-In"" won him the 1968 election. So while TV arguably cost Nixon the election once, it may very well have snagged him the election the second time around. If you enjoyed President Barack Obama's appearances on ""The Tonight Show"" and Letterman, you can thank Richard Nixon. From ""The Sixties: Television Comes of Age"" episode: Watch infamous ""Tonight Show"" tomahawk demo . 2. The rise of TV journalism . Before the Kennedy presidency, television was far behind print journalism in terms of sources audiences relied upon for news. But soon, people relied on TV news for the day's headlines as well as information on American troops in Vietnam, particularly the numbers of those killed or wounded. When something major happened on TV, it affected the whole country at the same exact time. TV news was the polar opposite of entertainment TV. The civil rights era, the JFK assassination and the space race all unfolded on TV. As David Brinkley stated, ""Television showed the American people TO the American people."" During the 1968 Democratic National Convention, 83 million Americans were glued to their television sets as 10,000 antiwar protesters outside the Chicago Hilton chanted, ""The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!"" over and over as police pushed the crowd off Chicago's Balbo Drive. 3. TV reaches a broader audience . ""The TV was the center of the house,"" recalled Tom Hanks, one of the executive producers of CNN's ""The Sixties"" series. ""I don't remember a time without TV."" Remember, there were only three channels (CBS, NBC and ABC) during the decade, and usually only one TV set per household. There were no ""for mature audiences only"" warnings. The syrupy sitcoms of the 1950s made way for shows such as ""The Dick van Dyke Show"" and ""The Andy Griffith Show."" These showcased more realistic situations, although there were still the same idealized versions of humanity as the previous decade. Griffith has stated that he put the best parts of himself and the people in his life into the inhabitants of the fictional town of Mayberry to achieve a blend of emotional honesty and laughs. That blueprint served as the benchmark for sitcoms for decades to come. ""Leave It to Beaver,"" which aired from 1957 to 1963, was the first show shot from the perspective of a child, bringing to life those universal embarrassing moments from childhood that kids were certain they'd never overcome, such as bringing home a bad grade or approaching the object of one's affection. Related: Archive of CNN's May 29th Facebook Q&A with Jerry Mathers . That kid-centric model was later replicated in TV shows such as ""The Wonder Years"" and, more recently, ""The Goldbergs."" Eventually, shows began blending that ""reality"" with fantasy, which led to copycats: ""The Addams Family"" and ""The Munsters,"" ""Bewitched"" and ""I Dream of Jeannie,"" and ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Green Acres."" 4. The advent of the variety show . During the '60s, there were 18 variety shows going on three networks! It's safe to say that television went ""variety show crazy"" for a while. Sunday night at 8 meant Ed Sullivan; but Dean Martin, Danny Kaye, Danny Thomas and Carol Burnett, to name a few, had eponymous variety-hour programs, too. Beatles + Sullivan = Revolution: Why Beatlemania could never happen today . Variety was considered a man's game at the time, but Burnett broke down a lot of walls with her three-wall sketch show. She and her cast mates sang, danced and did pratfalls -- often breaking character and cracking one another up in the process. Kind of a precursor to SNL's Debbie Downer sketch or most of Jimmy Fallon's SNL sketches. Burnett felt that if she was having fun, her audience would, too. From ""The Sixties: Television Comes of Age"" episode: Carol Burnett's pratfalls . 5. Television begins to tackle serious issues . Through a fantasy/sci-fi lens, ""The Twilight Zone"" creator Rod Serling often told stories of racism and fascism. Similarly, ""Star Trek"" addressed the notion of a time where social evolution has eradicated prejudice and mankind possesses no bias whatsoever.

"Washington (CNN) -- In a rare public appearance, President George W. Bush delivered a serious message for the 99%: Step up. The 43rd President, who has taken to oil painting, emerged from his self-imposed, post-presidential low-profile to call on the majority of Americans who have not had to sacrifice for -- and could easily ignore -- two costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that he launched. ""They are the 1% of America who kept the 99% safe,"" Bush said Wednesday of the 2.5 million military members who have served since 9/11. ""While it never hurts to say thank you, that is not really the point."" Speaking at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas and joined by second lady Jill Biden, the former President did not sugarcoat the disconnect between service members, their families and the civilian public, which he called the ""civilian-military divide."" It's ""troubling"" that 84% of veterans say the public isn't aware of the challenges they face and that 71% of Americans agree, Bush said, citing a survey by the Bush Institute and Syracuse University to be released later this year. The toll for members of the military has been high. More than 50,000 U.S. and coalition forces have been wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq, and 8,211 have died. See CNN interactive . Unemployment plagues veterans. At the end of last year, the unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans hovered at 10%, compared to just above 7% for non-vets. The suicide rate among vets is astronomical, with 22 suicides committed each day, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. And more than 400,000 veterans are waiting for their disability benefits in a backlogged VA system, says the group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. ""It's an unprecedented demand that we've placed on such a small group,"" said Paul Rieckhoff, head of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA). ""After everything they do for us, we have a duty to make that transition as easy as possible,"" he said, noting that higher education institutions and employers are among those not doing enough. He even said his own previous efforts, including sporting events designed to help vets, are important but aren't ""transformative enough."" Bush announced that his Military Service initiative has launched a multi-faceted, public-private partnership aimed at helping veterans assimilate back into civilian life. ""We'll be ... relentless in serving our vets,"" he said. The Bush Institute is working with a coalition of government, nonprofit, universities and private companies to de-stigmatize PTSD, help GI Bill recipients stay in school, and encourage employers to give veterans a chance. The straight-talking former President said employers need to tailor their recruiting and hiring practices to accommodate post-war employees. ""I mean, you don't see many job postings that say ""Wanted: experience hunting insurgents and terrorists willing to risk their lives for co-workers,"" Bush said. ""I mean, what's a veteran supposed to put down? 'My last office was a Humvee?'"" Bush also said Post Traumatic Stress Disorder needs to drop the 'D' from its acronym, PTSD. He referred to it as PTS, calling it an injury that can be treated. ""Employers would not hesitate to hire an employee getting treated for a medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure and they should not hesitate to hire veterans getting treated for post-traumatic stress,"" he said. Veterans groups praised Bush's effort. ""I honestly think this is a great program,"" said Verna Jones, director of the veterans affairs and rehabilitation division at the American Legion, who attended the event in Dallas. But veterans advocates say the talk has to be backed up by action. The elephant in the room, IAVA's Rieckhoff said, is the question of how to pay for it. And the monetary cost is great. A report released last March calculated that the cost of the wars, including health care for veterans, would be up to $6 trillion dollars. The United States has spent around $2 trillion directly on the military operations there.","President George W. Bush unveiled an aggressive initiative to serve veterans .

"(CNN) -- What gives M&Ms their bright colors? That depends on which country you're in. Mars Inc. primarily uses artificial food coloring for the candy in the United States, but M&Ms derive their candy coloring from natural sources in Europe. Now a Change.org petition begun by Renee Shutters and the Center for Science in the Public Interest is calling on Mars to stop using artificial dyes in its American M&Ms as well. As of Tuesday morning, the petition had more than 142,000 supporters. Shutters says her son Trenton showed noticeable improvements in mood and attention span after she removed artificial coloring from his diet a few years ago. M&Ms were his favorite candy. ""I just could not believe that something so small could make that big of a difference,"" Shutters says. European lawmakers moved to require warning labels on foods containing certain artificial colorings after a 2007 study found a slight increase in hyperactivity among children consuming a mixture of the dyes and a preservative. The required label reads: ""May have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children."" The move came despite the European Food Safety Authority's conclusion that the UK study ""provides limited evidence"" and ""cannot be used as a basis for altering the (accepted daily intake) of the respective food (colors)."" Instead of adding the warning, most manufacturers voluntarily switched to dyes derived from natural sources, such as beets or annatto for red, carrots for orange and saffron for yellow. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has declined to implement tougher regulations but acknowledged that ""certain susceptible children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and other problem behaviors"" may have their condition ""exacerbated by exposure to a number of substances in food, including, but not limited to, synthetic color additives."" The effects on behavior ""appear to be due to a unique intolerance to these substances and not to any inherent neurotoxic properties,"" the FDA said in 2011. Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says the FDA and big business need to take action. ""The Food and Drug Administration should protect the public's health by banning food dyes,"" Jacobson says. ""Companies of course could remove dyes voluntarily, switching to safer natural colorings, and a few big companies are beginning to do it."" In November, Kraft announced it would be removing artificial dyes from some varieties of its Macaroni & Cheese. ""We have absolute confidence in the safety of all the ingredients we use,"" Mars said in a statement. ""(We) are constantly evaluating and updating ingredients based on consumer preference, new technology, scientific information and availability of raw materials.""","Mars Inc. primarily derives candy coloring from natural sources in Europe .

"(CNN) -- Here's a question for you: . What do you think life in the United States would be like if there were no minimum wage? If employers were allowed to pay workers anything they wanted? Would much of American life turn into something out of Charles Dickens? Or would the country flourish? It's not as outrageous a notion as it sounds. For most of the time this nation has existed, that was the case: There simply was no such thing as a minimum wage. Right now the minimum-wage debate is in the news because President Barack Obama has proposed that it be raised. Currently, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour; Obama wants it to be raised to $9 per hour. In his State of the Union address this month, the president said: . ""Let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty."" The political battle will be over how much -- if at all -- the $7.25 minimum wage should be raised. There is significant opposition to an increase; Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, speaker of the House of Representatives, summed it up when he said: . ""When you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it. Why would we want to make it harder for small employers to hire people?"" There was no U.S. minimum wage at all until the eve of World War II. States had tried to institute minimum wages, but the United States Supreme Court repeatedly struck down those state laws. The Supreme Court's reasoning was that a minimum wage deprived workers of the right to set the price of their own labor. CNNMoney: The impact of a $9 minimum wage . This sounded increasingly absurd during the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, knowing he had the nation on his side, threw down the gauntlet when he proclaimed: ""All but the hopeless reactionary will agree that to conserve our primary resources of manpower, government must have some control over maximum hours, minimum wages, the evil of child labor, and the exploitation of unorganized labor."" A federal minimum-wage law was passed that the Supreme Court did not overturn. And so, in 1938, the first federal minimum wage went into effect: . Twenty-five cents per hour. As the number has increased over the decades, there have always been serious voices in agreement with Boehner's position: that when the minimum wage is raised, businesses are able to hire and pay fewer workers, so that not only is the economy harmed, but people who want jobs have a more difficult time finding them. On the other side, some economists argue that the higher-minimum-wages-means-fewer-jobs theory is, in the phrase used by former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, ""baloney."" Reich recently wrote that providing a bottom line beneath which workers' hourly pay must not fall is the nation's moral duty, and ""a decent society should do no less."" The minimum wage has been a part of American life for so long now that very few citizens have any memory of a time when it did not exist. But the United States was built by workers who were guaranteed no minimum wage -- in a country that, until the 1938 law, let the marketplace determine how much anyone was paid. (Reich's contention is that there is really no such thing as ""a 'market' that exists separate from society. . .[T]here's no 'market' in a state of nature, just survival of the fittest."") Some states have their own minimum-wage standards that are higher than the federal rate; the states are free to demand that workers earn more per hour than the federal $7.25 level, but may not pass laws that pay workers less. One of those states is Florida, where the current minimum wage is $7.79 per hour. I asked Mike King, a grocery worker in Collier County earning the minimum wage, if the increase to $9 would make an appreciable difference in his life. ""There's no question about it,"" he said. What may seem like small change to wealthier people, he said, would allow people in his situation to be at least a little better off: ""I'd be able to buy better quality food some of the time. I could pay for gas and car insurance, so I could drive to my job instead of taking public transportation or riding a bicycle. And it would help me be able to pay my electricity and phone bills on time."" The federal minimum-wage law has always served a symbolic purpose beyond setting a specific number. It has sent a signal to even the lowest-paid workers: . The country believes that what you do has value. The country will offer you a layer of protection that no one can undercut. Today's column began with one question, so let's end it with another. If there had never been a minimum-wage law passed -- if, as in the years before 1938, Americans today could be paid as little as employers could get away with -- and if, in 2013, someone in Congress proposed the first law ever that would guarantee workers a minimum wage. . . . Do you think, in our current political atmosphere, such a law would have a chance of passing? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene asks: What would life in U.S. be like if there were no minimum wage .
For most of U.S. history, there was no minimum wage; it started in 1938 under FDR .

"(CNN) -- Thai scrapyard workers accidentally detonated a suspected World War II-era bomb Wednesday, killing seven and injuring 19 after attempting to cut into it with a blowtorch. The device was discovered at a construction site in Bangkok, and moved to a scrapyard before workers tampered with it, in an attempt to break it down into smaller parts. Thai state news agency MCOT, quoting the the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration's Erawan Medical Center, said six people died at the scene. Another reportedly died before reaching the city's Mayo hospital. The blast, in Bangkok's Lad Prao district, caused a ten foot-deep (3 m) crater in the scrapyard's warehouse, and damaged neighboring properties. The device was around 3 ft (1 m) long and weighed 500 lb (225 kg). Local police commander Virasak Foythong told media that the scrap workers believed the bomb to have been defused. ""The workers at the warehouse thought the bomb was no longer active so they used a metal cutter to cut into it, causing the explosion."" Police said they suspected that the bomb was of World War II vintage but its origin was not determined. Both British and American bombers attacked Bangkok in 1944, while Thailand was an ally of Japan. It is the second war-era ordnance to have been discovered in the city in less than a week. A similar device was discovered last Saturday but was safely deactivated. It is not uncommon for World War II bombs to be unearthed in Asian cities, with a similar discovery made on a Hong Kong construction site several weeks ago.","Suspected WWII-era aerial bomb explodes in Bangkok neighborhood, killing seven .

"(CNN) -- Along with math, science and social studies, gun safety could soon be part of the first-grade curriculum in some Missouri public schools. A new measure that advocates for such classes for first-graders was signed into law last week. But the idea has prompted worry from some parents and experts about the role and effectiveness of gun safety programs in a classroom setting. ""I don't have a gun. My family doesn't have a gun. There is no reason for them to be teaching about gun safety when there are children with parents like me,"" Aimee Patton, a Kansas City blogger and mom to a 6-year-old girl, told CNN in a phone interview. Though her child attends school in Kansas, Patton has been openly critical of the bill in her blog, Pleasantly Eccentric, since the legislation was introduced one day before the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting last December. Twenty children -- all of them first-graders -- and six adults were killed at the Newtown, Connecticut, school by a lone gunman. The measure signed Friday by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon is part of the larger public safety bill HCS/SB 75. It encourages schools to teach gun safety to first-graders through courses such as the National Rifle Association's ""Eddie Eagle"" Gunsafe Program. ""The purpose of the program will be to promote safety and protection of children and emphasize how students should respond if they encounter a firearm,"" says the bill, which was sponsored by state Sen. Dan Brown, a lifetime member of the NRA. 5 things to know about guns . The legislation prohibits school personnel and instructors from making judgments about guns or from using firearms to teach the program. Brown told CNN in an interview that Sandy Hook didn't spur any changes in the law, which he said had been percolating for years. ""It became more relevant after Sandy Hook,"" Brown said, also noting that he did not talk with the NRA about the measure. Brown believes kids unfamiliar with guns are more likely to play with them and pull the trigger. Kids who grow up with guns, ""they get it."" A number of other states have taken steps encouraging schools to promote gun safety. The NRA noted the Missouri law's signing on its legislative website, but the group did not respond to efforts seeking additional comment. But in testimony before the U.S. Senate earlier this year, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said the group has a ""long and proud history of teaching"" safe and responsible gun ownership across the board and to kids, in particular. ""Our 'Eddie Eagle' children's safety program has taught over 25 million young children that if they see a gun, they should do four things: ""Stop. Don't touch. Leave the area. Tell an adult,"" he said. Eddie Eagle is a mascot dressed as an eagle who addresses gun safety issues for children in pre-K through third grade. ""The purpose of the 'Eddie Eagle' Program isn't to teach whether guns are good or bad, but rather to promote the protection and safety of children,"" the organization's website says, adding that its purpose is to prevent accidents. Scott Holste, a Nixon spokesman, told CNN the program is optional for school districts and is not mandated under the new law, which authorizes schools to seek public grants to fund safety programs. States tighten, loosen gun laws after Newtown . Conflicting opinions . Still, Amy Jordan Wooden, a Missouri resident and mother of two young children, thinks gun safety should stay out of her kids' classrooms. ""I think I'm a lot more interested in teachers and the legislature being focused on math, science and reading for our first-graders instead of an NRA curriculum. I trust the parents to teach the kids properly about the power of guns. That is where the responsibility lies, not in a school curriculum,"" she said. Other parents disagree. ""There are too many kids who grab the guns and kill their cousins. I agree, I think they should know gun safety. It would be helpful,"" Cathy Peters told CNN affiliate KCTV. Two studies critical of gun safety programs . Pediatricians and gun safety experts say, however, that the efforts behind the measure may be misguided. For instance, a 2004 study on firearm-related injuries in children, published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, found that gun safety programs for children were ineffective, ""do not prevent risk behaviors and may even increase gun handling among children."" Another 2004 study of the ""Eddie Eagle"" program, published by North Dakota State University's Department of Psychology, found that children were able to verbally repeat the program's message, but when they encountered a gun in a role-playing scenario, they were unable to put the skills to use. The North Dakota study said one shortcoming of programs like ""Eddie Eagle"" was the absence of active learning approaches. When and how do parents educate children about guns? ""Information-based programs are less successful because they do not actively allow the children the opportunity to practice the skills being taught,"" the study said. Former police investigator and gun safety expert Steve Albrecht said ""kids don't have the emotional maturity at that age."" Albrecht is a security consultant for schools and workplaces and is also a parent. He said schools have to play a bigger role in the gun safety discussion but ""in concert with the parents."" ""Part of the issue has to be educating the parents to keep the guns secure first. Because it doesn't matter if the kids have been to a gun safety program or not,"" said Albrecht. Patton agrees. She said the responsibility behind gun safety lies with parents and not with teachers. But LaPierre told the Senate in January that ""teaching safe and responsible gun ownership works"" and stressed that firearms accidents are at their lowest levels in more than 100 years because of safety programs like ""Eddie Eagle."" Brown said first-graders shouldn't be doing experiential learning with guns and felt the ""Eddie Eagle"" video would be enough. Guns OK in post office parking lots, federal judge rules . CNN's Bryan Koenig contributed to this report.","Missouri governor signed NRA-backed law last week .

"(EW.com ) -- This is worse than wearing sweatpants: Mean Girls isn't getting a Tina Fey-penned sequel! Despite some hopeful speculation from fans recently, Fey confirmed the news to Extra on Wednesday, saying, ""We're coming up next month on the 10-year anniversary of the original movie... We're going to see if there's any way to get everyone together, but not a movie, sadly. We're all past high school age."" (Mean Girls 2, the 2011 TV movie sequel with a whole new group of girls, is best not mentioned.) Like any good twenty-something, I love the movie, but the ""no sequel"" news is totally for the best. There's no way people wouldn't be disappointed by whatever they came up with, and now, fans can just continue to watch and love the original as the perfect high school satire that it is. For those that would like a little more, all hope isn't lost: Fey is directing her energy towards a possible Mean Girls musical (which she told EW about last year in her EW Interview). Since Fey has made it clear we aren't going to get Regina and Gretchen's High School Reunion, just for fun we went ahead and pictured where the whole fetch gang is now, 10 years post-high school. Regina George: Regina George continued playing lacrosse at the college level, and subsequently joined a sorority, which she was ultimately kicked out of after an email she wrote cleverly berating her sisters went viral. She now works in PR, and her assistant has told her she isn't allowed to tweet anymore, as her cutting, pitch-perfect insults have offended everyone from the Modern Family kids to the highest levels of the United States government. Anna Wintour has been nothing but impressed. Gretchen Wieners: Gretchen got pregnant by her loser boyfriend senior year of college, and then ditched the guy (Joey Donner). After giving birth to Bella (that name is totally going to happen), she decided motherhood was her true calling. Recently, she's the kindergarten helper in Bella's class, making sure every person gets a Valentine (including the cute single dads!). She also works part-time as an administrate assistant at Pillsbury, where she is regularly complimented on her hair. Cady Heron: After she broke up with Aaron Samuels because he was far too dumb for her post-high school, Cady listened to her mom (and Ms. Norbury) and attended Northwestern University, graduating with a degree in Mathematics. Currently, she's a teacher, and has a quiet life with good friends (including Janis, but not Damian; he knows what he did). Her secret pleasure is reading celebrity gossip, but she can't help but feel for the young women the tabloids exploit, regardless of the mistakes they may have made. Karen Smith: Karen's weather reports quickly went viral, and she was snapped up right out of high school to become one of the weather people for Fox News, a job she holds to this day. Smith still keeps up with Wieners and her daughter via Facebook; she's fond of ""Like""-ing nearly every post, and still hasn't totally figured out hashtags. Regina has not responded to her friend request. Aaron Samuels: Aaron works as a model. Obsessed with his body and weight, he's often overheard declaring he doesn't do carbs. Damian totally heard he may have a little bit of a drug habit, and his new girlfriend is a total gold digger. He cries for what could have been with Cady every year on Oct. 3. Janis Ian: After graduation, Janis went to art school before dropping out because there were too many rules. She moved to L.A., and while she hates most of the people she meets, she's built a solid career for herself as a modernist painter. She never unfriended any of the girls she knew when she was 17 because she enjoys the feeling of superiority she gets while regularly checking out their social media presences. She can be found with a protest sign in her hand. Damian: Damian became a shameless social climber. After graduating from college in the Midwest, he moved to NYC where he regularly stalked celebs and appeared as a hanger-on on various reality shows. He once helped Rachel Zoe pick out a pair of shoes. He dropped whatever his last name was, and now hosts an eponymous show on E!. Ms. Norbury achieved total world domination.

"(CNN) -- The mosque on Prospect Street is not only Cambridge, Massachusetts,' largest mosque, but it is also the city's only mosque. As many as 1,000 people a week, including immigrants, students, families and residents from surrounding neighborhoods, stop by to pray up to five times a day as Islam requires. Known as the Cambridge mosque, it is run by the Islamic Society of Boston and is just a few short blocks from the well-traveled Red Line, which serves Boston's many universities and colleges. ""The mosque is open to everyone,"" says spokeswoman Nicole Mossalam. ""We don't have a core membership. It's very fluid."" Law enforcement officials say the mosque has attracted a number of known terrorists and accused extremists, among them the accused Boston Marathon bombers, ""Lady al Qaeda,"" and now an American fugitive wanted for questioning for possible ties to ISIS' social-media wing -- too many for law enforcement to ignore. ""At some stage we have to accept reality, which is a number of people who have taken up arms against Americans either here in Boston or abroad with ISIS have an affiliation with that mosque, and so the mosque will come under scrutiny to determine what is going on and whether as importantly, there aren't others affiliated with the mosque who might be planning ill will,"" said Juliette Kayyem, CNN national security analyst and former Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary. At least 10 suspected or convicted terrorists have prayed at the mosque, a number confirmed by a federal law enforcement official, court documents and the mosque itself. ""None of these individuals, if and when they prayed at the ISB mosque, ever exhibited any hint of criminal or violent behavior. ...The Islamic Society of Boston unequivocally condemns ISIS and is deeply angered by the grievous harm it has done to innocent lives: American, Iraqi, Syrian and more,"" Mossalam said. She said, for the most part, the individuals did not participate in the mosque community or its programs. Nor is there any evidence suggesting Cambridge mosque officials knew or were involved with the suspects, nor do they preach any form of radical Islam. Still, the list of controversial worshipers is striking for their apparent ties to ISIS, al Qaeda and other extremist groups targeting the United States and its interests. Among the most prominent Cambridge mosque attendees: . Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, an MIT-educated, Pakistani neuroscientist serving 86 years in federal prison, has been dubbed ""Lady al Qaeda"" and become the poster girl for Islamic Jihad. ISIS militants who beheaded American journalist James Foley sent a letter to the family saying it had offered a prisoner exchange naming ""sister Dr. Afia Sidiqqi (sic)."" CNN recently interviewed Fowzia Siddiqui in Pakistan, who said her sister's name had been appropriated by terrorists: ""We want no violence in Aafia's name,"" she said. In 2008, Siddiqui was arrested in Afghanistan with numerous bomb-making documents, specifically for chemical and biological weapons, for a ""mass casualty attack"" against potential targets like the Statue of Liberty and Brooklyn Bridge. Her second husband is a nephew of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed. Siddiqui was not tried for terrorism but for grabbing a gun and opening fire on FBI agents during interrogation. Accused terror fugitive Ahmad Abousamra also attending services at the Cambridge mosque. He is being looked at in connection with ISIS' propagandist social media. Raised outside Boston, he speaks fluent English and Arabic and graduated from the University of Massachusetts, Boston, with a degree in computer science. He vanished from America in 2006 after allegedly receiving terror training in Yemen and fighting against U.S. troops in Iraq. His friend and fellow Cambridge mosque worshiper, pharmaceutical student Tarek Mehanna, is serving 17 years in federal prison after being found guilty of translating material for al Qaeda in Iraq, the precursor to ISIS. He appealed his case to the Supreme Court. ""All Muslims are obligated to pray five times a day and the Cambridge mosque is open for worship for all people; no ID's are checked; no one is excluded. If we ever observed any criminal or violent behavior, we would immediately intervene and notify the authorities,"" Mossalam said. Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was kicked out of the Cambridge mosque, according to a mosque member who spoke to CNN at the time of the attack. During prayers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev had several outbursts denouncing Muslims' incorporation of American holidays. The mosque confirms that Tamerlan Tsarnaev attended, as did his brother Dzhokar and Tsarnaev friend Ibragim Todashev. Todashev was allegedly involved with Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a triple murder in Waltham, Massachusetts. He was about to sign a sworn confession when he allegedly grabbed a knife and lunged at an FBI agent, who then fatally shot Todashev. The FBI investigated and called the shooting justified. In June, federal prosecutors charged another Cambridge mosque attendant with obstruction of justice in connection with the suspected marathon bombers. Part-time taxi driver Khairullozhon Matanov invited the Tsarnaev brothers to dinner the night of the marathon attack. Authorites say he deleted documents and photos from his computer after being notified he might be questioned by federal authorities in connection with the attack. ""You have data point after data point about various men, young men, coming to the mosque and becoming radicalized and then planning harmful events, then the mosque is and ought to be subject of scrutiny because there's just too many factors involved now,"" said retired DHS official Kayyem. The mosque was founded in 1981. Other controversial Cambridge worshipers include one of the mosque founders, Abdulrahman Alamoudi, who is serving 23 years after pleading guilty in 2004 to activities with ""nations and organizations that have ties to terrorsim."" The Mosque spokeswoman said the charges were filed after Alamoudi distanced himself from the mosque. The FBI described Alamoudi's prosecution as a ""major terrorism case."" Mossalam stressed the Islamic Society of Boston's record of ""building bridges of faith, fellowship and understanding"" with other religions and working with ""local, state and federal public officials.""","Officials: Accused Boston Marathon bombers, other extremists attended mosque .

"(CNN) -- A worn metal bracelet inscribed with the name of a fallen 9/11 firefighter washed up 10 days ago on the shores of New York's Robert Moses State Park. As the surf rolled away from her feet, Marlene Quinn picked it up. For Quinn, it was more than a serendipitous find. She was walking on the beach, she says, ""praying for peace and comfort"" months after the sudden death of her 62-year-old brother, Michael O'Neill, a volunteer firefighter and captain on Long Island. The fallen firefighter remembered on the weathered bracelet also was named Michael. ""Michael J. Otten,"" the inscription read. ""F.D.N.Y. LADDER 35 9/11/01."" Quinn remembered the Otten name, she said. He was the only person from her town who perished when the Twin Towers fell. ""God works in mysterious ways,"" Quinn recalled. Quinn tracked down an address for Otten's family. They live less than a mile away in East Islip, one block from where Quinn and her late brother grew up. She put the bracelet in the mail, along with a note. ""I knew they needed it and I thought it was my brother coming through,"" Quinn said. ""There is another firefighter in heaven."" When the bracelet arrived, Otten's widow, Marion, didn't even know it was missing, she said. Her son Jonathan had worn it in honor of his father. He lost it on the beach nearly a decade ago, when he was 11 or so. ""Things happen for a reason,"" Marion Otten says. ""I see it as a sign."" Jonathan Otten now keeps the bracelet on his bedroom dresser. He's afraid to lose it again, she said. ""It's another tie to his dad and the department,"" Marion Otten said. Jonathan Otten and his brother Christopher are both on the list to become New York City firefighters, their mother said. That would make four generations of the family in the FDNY. ""It's in their blood,"" she said. Marion Otten and Quinn met for the first time the other day. Quinn recalled the ""joy and comfort"" Marion Otten seemed to feel at getting the bracelet back. ""We have a connection, I feel,"" said Marion Otten, who will visit her late husband's firehouse on the 9/11 anniversary Thursday.","Bracelet honoring fallen 9/11 firefighter is found 10 years after it was lost .

"Beijing (CNN) -- San Francisco-based TechCrunch brought a taste of Silicon Valley to Beijing this week, with more than 100 startups showcasing their innovations to tech fans and investors at a two-day event in the Chinese capital. The conference attracted some of the most forward-thinking and dynamic Chinese technology wannabees, including ANTVR, a wearable gaming device company. The startup attracted a long line of visitors eager to try out its very first product, ANTVR kit. Consisting of a headset and a controller, ANTVR claims the kit can provide a ""fully immersive experience"" by projecting a high-definition image onto users' retinas without distortion and provide an experience similar to an IMAX movie. During the demo, the player is thrown into a pitch-dark room and told to find the source of a sound, which leads to a pale ghost with blood trickling down her face. Qin Zheng, founder of ANTVR said the kit is compatible with all major gaming consoles and will hit both Chinese and overseas markets by the end of the year. The 27-year-old said ANTVR went through the same difficulties as many startups in China â€” it was hard to find proper platforms to release products and raise funds. Crowdfunding . Qin founded the company half a year ago, and to get started raised initial funding of $231,095 on U.S. crowdfunding site Kickstarter. ""Fund-raising is hard (here). I think this is why everybody rushes to crowdfunding sites,"" Qin said. Lu Gang, head of Technode, TechCrunch's partner in China, said that Chinese startups face a unique set of challenges. ""I think Chinese startups (face) much tougher competition, like copies,"" said Lu. ""We've found so many copycats."" By bringing TechCrunch to China, Lu hopes to bring the originality and creativity that Silicon Valley is known for and inspire Chinese companies to invent something that ""really makes a difference."" ""I think the TechCrunch brand obviously stands for original work for entrepreneurs, and for creating something out of nothing, which is ideal. I think this is what everybody's striving for,"" says Lu. ""We want to encourage people here to be truly innovative instead of copying.""

"(CNN) -- The accusations are ominous. Russia has fired weapons into Ukraine and boosted the number of troops near the border, officials have told CNN. And the Kremlin is staging a new round of military exercises this week. Western leaders stepped up sanctions, but Russian President Vladimir Putin shows no sign of backing down. What's his endgame? ""He's got lots of options here, and he's playing it,"" retired Gen. Wesley Clark told CNN this week. ""He's like someone fumbling with a lock, trying to find the right key to open the door."" Here's a look at several goals Putin could have in mind: . Bolstering support at home . Putin certainly isn't winning many points worldwide in the court of public opinion. Western leaders slam Russia for backing separatists in Ukraine and fueling violence there -- accusations the Kremlin denies but can't seem to shake. But even as criticism grows abroad, things are playing out very differently inside Russia. Putin's popularity is soaring, said CNN's global affairs correspondent Elise Labott. ""His ratings haven't been so high since he went to war with another former pro-Western neighbor: Georgia in 2008,"" Labott said. Taking over territory . This is the scenario that Putin's fiercest critics worry is in the offing. They point to Russia's annexation of Crimea in March -- touted by Russia as a legitimate reflection of the will of the people and slammed by the West as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. NATO warned this week that Russia could use ""the pretext of a humanitarian or peacekeeping mission as an excuse to send troops into eastern Ukraine."" ""We're not going to guess what's on Russia's mind, but we can see what Russia is doing on the ground -- and that is of great concern,"" NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu told Reuters in an emailed statement. Clark, the former supreme allied commander of NATO, said even though it seems like Putin hasn't made up his mind yet about what steps he'll take, it's clear he has his eye on eastern Ukraine. ""He's building up his capacity to intervene. ... He wants that to be Russia,"" Clark said. Protecting Russia . Others argue Putin could have another goal in mind if he sends troops into Ukraine: protecting his own country. It's true that Putin is weighing intervention, said Stephen Cohen, a professor emeritus of Russian studies at Princeton University and New York University. But that doesn't mean it's a crisis of his making, said Cohen. ""He's being told by people who are advising him that this is no longer a struggle for Ukraine, but a struggle for Russia. These cities that are being attacked by the Ukrainian army are close to Russia,"" Cohen said. ""He's being told, if you let these cities go, if you lose those cities, you will fight tomorrow in Russia."" Alexander Nekrassov, a former Kremlin adviser, offered a similar take in an opinion column for CNN.com in March. ""As Ukraine was slipping into anarchy and chaos, with all sorts of radicals causing mayhem, President Putin's endgame became obvious,"" he wrote. ""He needed to do anything in his power to prevent Ukraine from becoming another Iraq, with a possibility of a civil war breaking out and violence spreading to Russia at some point."" Keeping Ukraine unstable . But could there also be an incentive for keeping things chaotic in the nation next door? Plenty, Labott said. ""For years, Putin has made keeping Ukraine from joining the European Union and NATO a major strategic goal,"" she said. But the February ouster of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was closely allied with Russia, made that much tougher. ""One way to stop Ukraine from joining the West,"" Labott said, ""is to make it too unstable by keeping this insurgency running."" Growing Russia's regional influence . Russia has spent billions of dollars in recent years building up its arsenal of warships, military planes and helicopters to go along with what remains the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, CNN's Jim Sciutto said. Now come the reports of troops amassing near the Ukrainian border and renewed military exercises. What's the point of flexing all this military muscle? You don't have to look too far back in history to see an example of a similar situation that -- from Russia's point of view -- really paid off, Sciutto said. In 2008, Russia sent troops into neighboring Georgia. ""There's a view in Russia that that's when the world started taking Russia seriously again, because for years Russia had seen itself as being far behind, hopelessly behind the West in military terms. And that's a problem that Russia's leadership wanted to correct,"" said Sciutto, CNN's chief national security correspondent. Sciutto said the focus is what Russia calls ""the near abroad"" -- former Soviet republics like Ukraine and Georgia. ""Russia wants to expand, reassert its influence (there) once again,"" Sciutto said. ""And it feels it needs, in order to do that, to expand its military."" Putin issues retaliatory ban on food imports . CNN's Alisyn Camerota contributed to this report.","Analysts say Vladimir Putin is weighing his options with Ukraine .
The Russian President could have a number of goals in mind .
Putin's fiercest critics worry he's pushing to take over territory .

"(CNN) -- From minibars to pillow menus to 24-hour butlers, today's hotels have turned every indulgence and convenience into a standard necessity. But this wasn't always the case. Not long ago, those little shampoo bottles that people now love to swipe didn't even exist. Nor did in-room iPads or fingerprint recognition technology. Oh, the humanity! Thankfully, over the last 100 years some innovative hotels have helped pave the way for these modern accommodation marvels. Because of their foresight and progressiveness, these ground-breaking properties forever changed the future of the industry, enabling guests to expect -- and demand -- increasingly more. Electric Xmas tree: Hotel del Coronado, San Diego . Currently celebrating its 125th anniversary, this scenic beachside resort made jaws drop back in December 1904 when it unveiled the world's first electronically lit, outdoor Christmas tree. Back then, candles were still commonly used to don yuletide trees and electric Christmas lights were a rarity. Hotel del Coronado's extravagant holiday display amazed guests at the time and set the stage for the lavish hotel light exhibitions we now see today. Hotel del Coronado, 1500 Orange Avenue, Coronado, CA; rooms from $321; +619 435 6611 . En-suite bathrooms: The Goring Hotel, London . Renowned for having hosted various members of the royal family throughout the years (Kate Middleton even stayed here the night before her wedding to William), the Goring is widely considered one of the top luxury hotels on the planet. However, when it first opened back in 1910, what really wowed the travel industry was that each bedroom was fitted with en-suite bathrooms -- something that had never been seen before at any other accommodation property. Needless to say, The Goring's early guests were delighted not to have to queue up for the toilet any longer. The Goring Hotel, Beeston Place, London, UK; rooms from $455: +44 (0) 20 7396 9000 . In-room radios: Boston Park Plaza Hotel, Boston . When this Boston property opened back in 1927, it was the first hotel to provide guest radios in each room, a feature that had never been offered on such a wide scale before. To put this in perspective, the radio in the late 1920s was extremely popular among Americans and was increasingly becoming a main source for news, entertainment and music -- similar to what the TV and Internet would become for later generations. It wasn't until 1933 that two-thirds of Americans would own a radio set at home, so to have one available in one's hotel room in 1927 was quite a prospect. Boston Park Plaza Hotel, 50 Park Plaza at Arlington Street, Boston, MA; rooms from $100; +617 426 2000 . Room service: The Waldorf Astoria, New York City . The iconic Waldorf Astoria is renowned for many things including its Art Deco motifs, Waldorf salad and plethora of celebrity guests. But what truly revolutionized the hospitality industry was its introduction of room service in the early 1930s. The novelty of such a convenient 24-hour service was an instant hit amongst the Waldorf's high-end guests and it wasn't long before other properties across the globe begin following suit. As a result, lodgers everywhere can now comfortably chow down in their bathrobes without having to do much more than push a button. The Waldorf Astoria, 301 Park Avenue, New York, NY; rooms from $288; +212 355 3000 . Minibars: Hilton Hong Kong . Countless thirsty travelers saved and their wallets thinned -- all thanks to one Hilton executive and Siegas, the German company that invented the refrigerated minibar in the 1960s. In 1974 an executive from Hong Kong Hilton (closed in 1995) was inspired to stock overpriced liquors in all 840 rooms, and lo the loved/hated minibar was globalized. The minibar invention was said to have led to a 500% increase in room-service drink sales and a 5% boost to the company's net income that year, according to the Atlantic. Though the Hilton closed, the company has a presence in Hong Kong with the Conrad. Conrad Hong Kong, Pacific Place, 88 Queensway, Hong Kong; rooms from $382; +852 2521 3838 . Air conditioning: Adolphus Hotel, Dallas . Dallas, Texas can get quite hot and humid throughout the summer months, with temperatures often soaring into the high 90s F. So in 1950 when the Adolphus became the first hotel in the world to offer central air conditioning, we can only imagine how thankful its sweaty guests must have been. In-room air-conditioning for warm climate hotels has since become a commonplace comfort. Adolphus Hotel, 1321 Commerce Street, Dallas, TX; rooms from $103; +214 742 8200 . Soap and shampoo: Four Seasons London at Park Lane, London . Forgot to pack shampoo for your getaway? Not to worry -- most hotels these days have plenty of mini toiletry bottles on hand to keep you lathered up throughout your stay. Prior to 1970, however, hotel guests would have been out of luck. It wasn't until the Four Seasons London at Park Lane opened its doors that lodgers were first introduced to the concept of bathroom amenities such as shampoo. And even then, the very first shampoo offerings at the Four Seasons Park Lane were plastic little sachets that were difficult to rip open. Don't take those handy little hotel bottles for granted again! Four Seasons London at Park Lane, Hamilton Place, London, UK; rooms from $639; +44 (20) 7499 0888 . Carbon neutral: Wolgan Valley Resort, Australia . As the first carbon neutral-certified resort in the world, this high-end, multi award-winning getaway in Australia's Blue Mountains single-handedly introduced the concept of responsible luxury travel to the world in October 2009, proving that green, eco-friendly accommodation could also be indulgent.

"(CNN) -- The death of famed actress Lauren Bacall, the husky-voiced starlet known for her sultry sensuality, not only meant the loss of a true Hollywood legend, but also the end of a golden era of icons. As first reported by Slate, all of the 16 Hollywood icons named in singer Madonna's pop song, ""Vogue,"" have now died after the passing of Bacall on Tuesday. Famed actress Lauren Bacall dies at 89 . The song, released in March 1990, was inspired by the New York City dance community. Voguing is a stylized dance that evolved from the Harlem ballroom scene in the 1980s. One section of the song contains only spoken words in which Madonna quickly lists off 16 celebrities that are considered part of the golden era of Hollywood: ""Greta Garbo, and Monroe / Dietrich and DiMaggio / Marlon Brando, Jimmy Dean / On the cover of a magazine / Grace Kelly; Harlow, Jean / Picture of a beauty queen / Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire / Ginger Rogers, dance on air / They had style, they had grace / Rita Hayworth gave good face / Lauren, Katharine, Lana too / Bette Davis, we love you."" The black and white music video was famous for its unique choreography, an homage to classic Hollywood. The video was directed by David Fincher who went on to direct films such as ""Fight Club,"" ""Se7en,"" and ""The Social Network.""

"London (CNN) -- A fighter jet was scrambled Tuesday to escort a passenger plane into Britain's Manchester Airport after the pilot received information that a ""possible suspicious device"" was on board, police said. The plane landed safely after being escorted by the Royal Air Force jet and the airport said the threat was now over. Greater Manchester Police said via Twitter that one man on board the plane had been arrested on suspicion of making a hoax bomb threat. The other passengers are now being allowed off the aircraft, the force said. Manchester Airport's press office said flights have resumed after being suspended for a 25-minute period. Qatar Airways confirmed that flight QR23 from Doha to Manchester, an Airbus A330-300, had landed safely with 269 passengers and 13 crew on board. ""The crew onboard had received a threat about a possible device on board and Qatar Airways immediately took all the necessary precautions to alert British authorities,"" the airline said. ""The crew is now fully assisting police at the airport with their inquiries."" Earlier, Chief Superintendent John O'Hare of Greater Manchester Police said police did not know how genuine the threat was but that it was vital police dealt with the situation ""as a full emergency."" He urged people not to be alarmed by the presence of police and other agencies at the airport and on the airfield. ""Our response will be as comprehensive as it is proportionate, with the safety of those on board and in and around the airport our paramount concern,"" he said. A passenger on the plane, Josh Hartley, posted a video to Instagram showing a fighter jet flying alongside the aircraft, filmed through the plane window. Posting on Twitter, he said that emergency services were on the landing strip and that armed police were outside the plane.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A battle royale over an estimated $500 million treasure that a Florida deep-sea salvage company found last year is due for a fresh round in court in Florida on Monday. Security forces cordon off the Ocean Alert, an Odyssey Marine Exploration ship, in July 2007. The Spanish government now says the 500,000 silver and gold coins that the company, Odyssey Marine Exploration, found last year in the Atlantic Ocean near Spain came from one of its ships that sunk in a 19th-century naval battle. Spain wants the entire treasure returned, but Odyssey insists Spain may have no right to it. Lawyers for both sides are due to present arguments Monday morning in a U.S. federal court in Tampa, Florida, in another round of the case that started last year, Odyssey spokeswoman Natja Igney told CNN. Odyssey found the coins last year and quietly airlifted them in crates from Gibraltar, a British colony on Spain's southern tip, to Florida for safekeeping. The company then said it was unclear how the huge quantity of coins it found on the seabed had gotten there. It declined to reveal the location, citing security reasons, and mysteriously dubbed the site ""Black Swan."" But the Spanish government, at a recent Madrid news conference, said it's really not so complicated. ""The mystery is over,"" said James Goold, a U.S. lawyer representing Spain, told the news conference. ""Using a variety of methods to conceal what it was doing, Odyssey Marine Exploration stripped the gravesite that is the Spanish navy warship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes of coins and other objects."" ""The coins and other artifacts that Odyssey took from the site are documented to have been on the Mercedes,"" Goold said. The Mercedes was a 34-gun frigate, a ship very common at the time in the Spanish navy. The Mercedes left Peru, stopped in Uruguay and was just a day's sail from Spain when the four-ship Spanish squadron was attacked by a British fleet in October 1804, according to a Spanish government's filing to the Florida court. In the ensuing Battle of Cape St. Mary, south of Portugal, the Mercedes exploded after being hit in its powder magazine. It sank with its cargo, killing the 200 Spanish sailors and civilians aboard. Spain accuses Odyssey of looting the gravesite of a sovereign Spanish-flagged navy vessel. But Odyssey executives aren't so sure the coins came from the Mercedes, and they say they certainly didn't come from a gravesite. ""I think in order to have a gravesite, you certainly need the remains of a shipwreck, and you would certainly need the remains of some humans. Neither has been found at the site,"" Odyssey co-founder Greg Stemm told CNN. He invited Spanish experts to join Odyssey in further investigation.  Watch Stemm describe the gold that was found » . But Spain says it has seen the evidence. It recently dispatched a team, including a government marine archaeologist and coin expert, to Florida to examine the treasure held by Odyssey. These specialists told the Madrid news conference that it's a vast trove of coins, including fabled ""pieces of eight,"" some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru -- then a Spanish colony. Stemm told CNN most of the 500,000 coins are silver; with a smaller amount being gold. The visiting Spanish experts, he said, saw only a small percentage of the coins, and he called for more research. ""We are not after the gold,"" Guillermo Corral Van Damme, a Ministry of Culture senior official told CNN. ""We are after the history, of the memory, of the respect, essentially, for what is a marine graveyard of our people."" But Stemm countered, ""Well, if they're really not in it for the money, then we would be happy just to keep all the coins and do the archaeological work at no charge, if it turns out there's a Spanish interest."" The Peruvian government also is monitoring this case, a Peruvian diplomat told CNN. Media reports have quoted some authorities there as saying Peru might also have a claim, if it's proven that some of the treasure came from Peru. Spain might be willing to share some of the treasure with Peru, but out of a sense of a common cultural heritage, rather than a strictly monetary operation, Jose Jimenez, another Spanish Ministry of Culture senior official, told the Madrid news conference. Odyssey says its leading hypothesis is that the coins may have come from the Mercedes, pending further research, Odyssey lawyer Melinda MacConnel told CNN. But MacConnel said even if it's proven that the treasure was aboard the Mercedes, Spain still doesn't have an automatic claim because the ship, at the time, did not meet the legal standard for ""a sovereign immune vessel."" ""This ship was not on a military mission at the time of its sinking. It was transporting mostly private goods, actually,"" MacConnel said. But Goold, the Washington-based lawyer for Spain, told CNN, ""This case has a lot more visibility because of the artificial mystery that was created, and because of the large amount of gold and silver that was taken from the ship. But the legal principles are not new."" ""I've been to court before on them and we have always won and we expect the same result here,"" Goold said. ""A navy ship is a navy ship. This is property of the national government, subject to exclusive control of the national government."" The court hearing on Monday in Tampa is not expected to be the last round in this battle over the treasure.","Lawyers for both sides are due to present arguments Monday morning .

"(CNN) -- When does learning begin? As I explain in the talk I gave at TED, learning starts much earlier than many of us would have imagined: in the womb. I was surprised as anyone when I first encountered this notion. I'm a science writer, and my job is to trawl the murky depths of the academic journals, looking for something shiny and new -- a sparkling idea that catches my eye in the gloom. Starting a few years ago, I began noticing a dazzling array of findings clustered around the prenatal period. These discoveries were generating considerable excitement among scientists, even as they overturned settled beliefs about when we start absorbing and responding to information from our environment. As a science reporter -- and as a mother -- I had to find out more. This research, I discovered, is part of a burgeoning field known as ""fetal origins,"" and it's turning pregnancy into something it has never been before: a scientific frontier. Obstetrics was once a sleepy medical specialty, and research on pregnancy a scientific backwater. Now the nine months of gestation are the focus of intense interest and excitement, the subject of an exploding number of journal articles, books, and conferences. What it all adds up to is this: much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life -- the air she breathes, the food and drink she consumes, the chemicals she's exposed to, even the emotions she feels -- are shared in some fashion with her fetus. They make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself. The fetus treats these maternal contributions as information, as what I like to call biological postcards from the world outside. By attending to such messages, the fetus learns the answers to questions critical to its survival: Will it be born into a world of abundance, or scarcity? Will it be safe and protected, or will it face constant dangers and threats? Will it live a long, fruitful life, or a short, harried one? The pregnant woman's diet and stress level, in particular, provide important clues to prevailing conditions, a finger lifted to the wind. The resulting tuning and tweaking of the fetus's brain and other organs are part of what give humans their enormous flexibility, their ability to thrive in environments as varied as the snow-swept tundra in Siberia and the golden-grassed savanna in Africa. The recognition that learning actually begins before birth leads us to a striking new conception of the fetus, the pregnant woman and the relationship between them. The fetus, we now know, is not an inert blob, but an active and dynamic creature, responding and adapting as it readies itself for life in the particular world it will soon enter. The pregnant woman is neither a passive incubator nor a source of always-imminent harm to her fetus, but a powerful and often positive influence on her child even before it's born. And pregnancy is not a nine-month wait for the big event of birth, but a crucial period unto itself -- ""a staging period for well-being and disease in later life,"" as one scientist puts it. This crucial period has become a promising new target for prevention, raising hopes of conquering public health scourges like obesity and heart disease by intervening before birth. By ""teaching"" fetuses the appropriate lessons while they're still in utero, we could potentially end vicious cycles of poverty, infirmity and illness and initiate virtuous cycles of health, strength and stability. So how can pregnant women communicate to their fetuses what they need to know? Eat fish, scientists suggest, but make sure it's the low-mercury kind -- the omega-three fatty acids in seafood are associated with higher verbal intelligence and better social skills in school-age children. Exercise: research suggests that fetuses benefit from their mothers' physical activity. Protect yourself from toxins and pollutants, which are linked to birth defects and lowered IQ. Don't worry too much about stress: research shows that moderate stress during pregnancy is associated with accelerated infant brain development. Seek help if you think you might be suffering from depression: the babies of depressed women are more likely to be born early and at low birth weight, and may be more irritable and have more trouble sleeping. And -- my favorite advice -- eat chocolate: it's associated with a lower risk of the high blood pressure condition known as preeclampsia. When we hold our babies for the first time, we imagine them clean and new, unmarked by life, when in fact they have already been shaped by the world, and by us. It's my privilege to share with the TED audience the good news about how we can teach our children well from the very beginning. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Annie Murphy Paul.","Learning begins in the womb, says Annie Murphy Paul .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy battled back from a poor start to claim his second straight major title in the fading gloom of Valhalla Sunday with a one-shot victory over Phil Mickelson in the PGA Championship. In near pitch darkness, the 25-year old from Northern Ireland parred the final hole for a three-under 68 to finish on 16-under 268 and deny American veteran Mickelson his sixth major title at 44 years of age. McIlroy was winning the Wanamaker Trophy for the second time and his fourth major, consolidating his status as world number one. The overnight leader trailed Rickie Fowler by three shots as he turned for his back nine but rekindled his hopes with a stunning eagle on the par-five 10th to go 14-under. But up ahead, Fowler was joined on 15-under by playing partner Mickelson and Sweden's Henrik Stenson, who was also making a tremendous last round charge. McIlroy, bidding for his third straight victory after his British Open and WGC-Bridgestone titles, refused to be daunted and a birdie on the 13th saw him draw level. First Stenson, then Fowler and Mickelson dropped shots to go back to 14-under and when McIlroy birdied the 17th he led by two playing the last. With the light fading fast, Fowler and Mickelson agreed to let McIlroy and his last day partner Bernd Wiesberger of Austria to also hit their tee shots on the 18th, effectively playing it as a fourball. McIlroy nearly found the water with his drive and had to settle for his par, while Mickelson made his birdie to edge ahead of Fowler and Stenson into second place. American pair Jim Furyk and Ryan Palmer finished on 12-under in joint fifth. McIlroy thanked Mickelson and Fowler for their sportsmanship as he accepted the trophy and said there was never any doubt in his mind he would finish the job Sunday. ""I wanted to win this thing and get out of here,"" he said. His latest triumph completed a remarkable run for McIlroy, who had endured a difficult 2013 after first PGA Championship success two years ago. ""I'd never dreamed I'd have a summer like this,"" he admitted. Only the U.S. Masters title now eludes McIlroy to complete a full set of the majors and he will surely focus his efforts on the 2015 edition at Augusta in search of a hat-trick of successes at golf's highest level.","Rory McIlroy wins PGA Championship at Valhalla .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A young girl bravely stood to ask the Dalai Lama's doctor a question, and he gave her an unusual answer. Dr. Tsewang Tamdin, a world-renowned expert in Tibetan medicine, visited Emory University in Atlanta on Monday as part of his effort to reach more American medical practitioners. He wants to develop collaborative projects between the Tibetan medicine system, which is more than 2,500 years old, and Western medicine. The little girl told Tamdin she suffered from asthma. She wanted to know if there was anything in Tibetan medicine that could help her get better. Tamdin, who spoke through a translator for the hourlong lecture, immediately switched to English. In a gentle, almost too-soft tone, he explained what might help. Inhalers doctors prescribe for asthmatics works well, he said, and told her to continue using one if she does already. The inhaler, though, treats the symptoms only. Tibetan medical practice, he explained, ultimately aims to get to the root cause of the problem. ""While others might consider the holistic practice of Tibetan medicine 'alternative medicine' or a kind of side practice, I would like for others outside of our system to consider the Tibetan healing system full-fledged healing,"" Tamdin said. ""Tibetan medical knowledge has tremendous potential to add to modern medicine."" Tibetan practice teaches that people get sick when a person's physical, psychological and spiritual well-being are out of balance. To restore balance, Tamdin recommended diet and exercise changes for the girl. He encouraged her to get proper rest and to get exercise that encouraged deep breathing, such as skipping or cycling. He also suggested eating three or four white raisins a day. There is a property in the fruit that helps breathing, he said. But perhaps the biggest sacrifice for a child was his advice to avoid cold foods -- particularly, he said, ice cream. Another patient who came to him with asthma symptoms would get a completely different diagnosis, Tamdin said. Each patient's disease is treated differently from the next. That's in large part because traditional Tibetan medicine is grounded in Buddhist philosophy. In his training to become a physician, Tamdin also studied Buddhist tradition and astrology. American and Tibetan doctors have some practices in common. If Tamdin were to have a longer consultation with the girl, he said he would perform familiar diagnostic tests. He would examine her urine sample and take her pulse, but he also would ask questions that would be the more familiar terrain of a psychologist. He tries to find out if a person is angry or anxious or if someone is becoming too self-centered. ""Tibetans believe in our interconnectedness,"" said Geshe Lobsang Negi, a former monk who is now director of the Emory-Tibet partnership. ""When we lose that perspective -- that we are a kind of little speck that is infinitely connected with the rest of the world -- when we see ourselves as the solid, fixed, all-important center of the universe, we call that ignorance, and that means we are vulnerable to illness."" This whole person approach to Tibetan medicine is being analyzed by a number of research studies in the United States. An NIH-funded study is examining the impact that compassion meditation can have on alleviating depression. Compassion meditation is a Tibetan Buddhist mind training that asks a person to examine why they feel a certain way about someone and then to develop feelings of love and empathy for a number of people that will grow with more practice to include even people they normally dislike. Studies have shown the medical effectiveness of meditation overall. A 2003 study of mindfulness-based meditation showed enhanced antibody production after someone receives a flu vaccine. Another study from that same year found cancer patients who were trained in mindfulness-based stress reduction showed a boost in their immune system. And a study this year from Carnegie Mellon University showed mindfulness-based meditation has a far-reaching influence on both psychological and physical health. Mindfulness means being present and in the moment, and observing in a nonjudgmental way. Negi's 2008 study of compassion meditation showed a reduction in stress-induced immune and behavioral responses. Several other studies under way are looking at the impact of Tibetan treatments on certain viral illnesses and on hepatitis. Tamdin believes ignorance is at the root cause of all illness. ""If you think about this, it makes sense,"" Negi said. ""For instance, if you believe you are the center of the universe and someone has something you want, you may become jealous and believe you deserve what that person has."" ""You may become so jealous,"" he added, ""you don't sleep at night and you will be stressed. Medical tests have shown there is a biochemical change in your body created by a release of a stress hormone. In Tibetan medicine, it is important to recognize the role the mind can play on our own physical well-being."" Tamdin said that modern medicine treats symptoms, but said a patient will never get better if they fail to attend to psychological issues. ""If one does not gain this understanding of selflessness, they won't be able to overcome their ignorance,"" he said. ""One way to look at it is to watch the bird and its shadow. It may fly and fly high into the sky, but it continues to leave a shadow on the surface of Earth. As long as you have ignorance within you -- even though you are enjoying good health -- there is always a shadow of sickness falling upon you. From this ignorance arises three mental poisons: attachment, hatred and delusion."" All those will affect energy, he said. In addition to actual medicine and dietary changes, a Tibetan doctor may also prescribe the patient practice more kindness and compassion toward others -- or that they practice more compassion meditation. Western medicine is reluctant to accept the Tibetan medical idea that some unexplained illnesses may ultimately be caused by someone's karma or even by evil spirits. The language Tibetan doctors use to suggest that good health is based on the balance of bile, phlegm and wind may seem a little too foreign to modern medicine practitioners. But the holistic approach to a patient's health -- treatments that involve diet, behavior, prescription of medicine and contemplative practices -- may continue to appeal to physicians after they see demonstrated proof that these kind of therapies work. ""The Tibetan tradition has evolved over 2,500 years,"" Negi said. ""It has a rich tradition that has helped the health of people for many many years. ""His holiness the Dalai Lama was the first to say that these things we believe in should be subjected to scientific tools so we could better understand the human condition overall and help us to better deal with the situation of our own well-being.""","Tibetan medical experts want more collaborative projects with modern medicine .
Tibetan doctors sometimes prescribe kindness and compassion to cure illness .

"Cupertino (CNN) -- The days of Apple just making your favorite gadgets are over. The company is about to enter the payments services arena taking on PayPal, Google, Facebook, Amazon and others in offering a way to allow you to pay using their system. One of Apple's big plays at its event in Cupertino was a fingerprint scanner for the newest iPhones, which will allow shoppers to ditch the magnetic strip when they shop in store. But the initial rollout of Apple Pay, in October, is only in the U.S. European and Asian banking systems are already embracing contactless payment, so it's strange Apple has chosen to focus on its home turf of America first rather than push for an immediate global release. It means customers outside of the U.S. won't yet benefit from the new features, and puts Apple in a situation whereby if it doesn't move quickly, customers will be happy enough with a card that has the same powers instead. Apple Pay emulates your wallet digitally, and will work with a number of retail stores and banks in the U.S. to allow you to pay with your phone, or in the future your watch. But rather than gear a system towards skimming off the top, or trying to understand users' buying behavior, Apple is -- presumably -- making the move to sell more devices. Apple was very clear in telling those that watched its event that it won't track or store information about where you shop, what you buy, or how much those purchases cost. Apple's pitch was about empowering the banks and stores. Its decision to roll out in the U.S. first could be because the need isn't so great elsewhere. In the UK, many banks now offer contactless payment cards as standard, while Chip and Pin, rolled out across Europe some time ago, has also been incredibly successful in reducing over the counter fraud. It could also be about Europe's limit on contactless payments. Trying to explain that you can only use your phone for small purchases is a complicated sell and one that means you aren't likely to ditch your bank cards altogether. In the U.S., there is no limit. But will Apple's delay in rolling the service out elsewhere allow others to capitalize on the gap in the market? Having seen Apple's new system up close, it is unlikely. However, Apple's decision to finally jump into the NFC tap-to-pay arena now legitimizes the experience and will only accelerate the adoption of the technology. Is an idea that Visa Europe shares. Steve Perry, the company's chief digital officer, said Apple's entry to the market represents a critical piece of the mobile payments jigsaw. He called it a ""pivotal moment"" for digital payments, demonstrating the ""momentum behind mobile and contactless services."" It might have taken seven years to get here, but he said Apple's decision to enter the market ""reflects the scale of opportunity that exists in digital payments today."" Apple's support will drive usage of contactless services around the world and he anticipates what he calls a ""halo effect"" benefiting all mobile payments players. That might sound an exaggeration, but so far contactless payments have very much been a chicken and egg scenario. Companies have waited for mobile phone manufacturers to get on board, and mobile phone makers have delayed getting on board because of a lack of infrastructure. Apple clearly believes that in the U.S. at least, that tipping point has been reached. With the introduction of TouchID last year, Apple had the right technology in place to make it a decent proposition to the banks on the security front. And with Apple now involved, European and Asian banks will no doubt be knocking on the Cupertino-based company's door begging to be involved. Read more: Apple just got its mojo back .

"(CNN) -- As same-sex marriage has become accepted in a way that would have been unthinkable a decade ago, the media have -- perhaps unwittingly -- played a crucial role. It's not that most journalists lean left on such social issues as gay rights, though that's hard to dispute. It's that the power of pictures can neutralize political propaganda. Once same-sex marriage was legalized in such early states as Iowa and Massachusetts, the photos and footage of happy couples celebrating made clear that no one was really threatened by such unions. The visuals put a human face on the debate. Even as stories quoted people who remained staunchly opposed to same-sex marriage, the pictures conveyed that the sky was not falling -- and by the time New York, Maryland and Washington legalized same-sex unions, it was, well, less newsworthy. But that's hardly true everywhere, as a stunning backlash in Mississippi makes clear. The first known gay wedding in the town of Laurel, Mississippi, was, naturally, a story for the local paper. And it was a story with a heart-rending twist. An article in the the Laurel Leader-Call recounted Jessica Powell's wedding to Crystal Craven, who was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer and has had three operations in the past year. It was a moving piece that described how Craven, at the wedding, wore a white cowboy hat to hide the scars from her latest surgery. ""If chemo doesn't work,"" she said, ""we don't know what happens after that."" Watch: Is the murdered model's beauty driving the Oscar Pistorius coverage? The result: A torrent of angry calls, canceled subscriptions and outraged comments on the paper's website and Facebook page. As recounted by Deep South Progressive, one person wrote: ""This is what we have to put up with on the world news every night. Never thought I would open my local paper and see such. Insulting!!!"" Said another: ""It's a sad day for traditional family values when this is printed on the front of a newspaper."" The paper's owner, Jim Cegieklski, responded in an op-ed: . ""You don't have to like something for it to be historic. The holocaust, bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the Black Sox scandal are all still historic. I'm in no way comparing the downtown wedding of two females to any of these events (even though some of you made it quite clear that you think gay marriage is much worse), I'm just saying that whether you liked the story or not, the first known gay wedding to take place in Jones County is still historic."" He added: ""I can't help but be saddened by the hate-filled viciousness of many of the comments directed toward our staff."" Watch: Was the press ready to smear Pete Domenici over his out-of-wedlock baby? The Leader-Call deserves credit for standing by a legitimate story that infuriated part of its readership. There was no attempt to glorify gays; the piece simply recounted the wedding, which was purely symbolic, since Mississippi doesn't allow same-sex marriage. What was stunning was the way some critics simply ignored the fact that one of the women is fighting for her life. Maybe this resonates more deeply for taking place in the South, where many leading newspapers once staunchly defended racial segregation in a way that is now embarrassing -- and which prompted some of them to apologize decades later. At the same time, a column in Sunday's Washington Post makes clear that those who believe the press tilts too far toward same-sex marriage have a valid point. Watch: New York anchor who attacked wife gets the tabloid treatment . Ombudsman Patrick Pexton reports on an e-mail dialogue he facilitated between a reader and a Post reporter he declines to name. The reader complained that the Post minimizes ""the millions of Americans who believe in traditional marriage and oppose redefining marriage into nothingness."" The reporter said: ""The reason that legitimate media outlets routinely cover gays is because it is the civil rights issue of our time. ... The true conservative would want the government out of people's bedrooms, and religion out of government."" That is bias, pure and simple. Yes, it is a civil rights issue, but the reporter simply can't understand why anyone would have a different viewpoint other than that the government should not interfere on such issues as same-sex marriage and perhaps, by extension, abortion. If this seems outrageous to you, keep in mind that President Barack Obama did not come out for same-sex marriage until the final months of his first term. Many people are opposed to it for reasons ranging from tradition to religion, and we in the press have to respect that. Watch: Mark Sanford launches forgiveness tour in S.C. There was a time when most gay journalists remained closeted for fear of being penalized. A decade or two from now, as today's younger people move into positions of power, opponents of same-sex marriage may seem as wrong-headed and their views as antiquated as those of people who defended keeping blacks at the back of the bus. The media must be even-handed on this divisive issue, but they might also take a page from a small Mississippi paper that bigotry shouldn't deter them from treating gay couples fairly. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: Media has played role in growing acceptance of gay marriage .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Paris Jackson, the 15-year-old daughter of Michael Jackson, was rushed to a hospital after cutting one of her wrists early Wednesday morning, sources close to the Jackson family told CNN. Paris called a suicide counseling hotline early Wednesday, which lead to a counselor calling 911 to the Jackson home in Calabasas, California, those sources said. ""Being a sensitive 15-year-old is difficult no matter who you are,"" attorney Perry Sanders said Wednesday morning. ""It is especially difficult when you lose the person closest to you. Paris is physically fine and is getting appropriate medical attention. Please respect her privacy and the family's privacy."" Paris Jackson: Superstar's daughter builds own identity in spotlight . Other Jackson sources stopped short of calling the incident a suicide attempt, although one suggested it might be ""a cry for help"" from the teenager. Paris posted messages to her million-plus Twitter followers late Tuesday evening: . ""i wonder why tears are salty?"" ""yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away . ""now it looks as though they're here to stay"" The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said its deputies ""responded to a medical situation"" at an address that matches the Jacksons' Calabasas home at 1:27 a.m. Wednesday. A patient was taken to a hospital, it said. Paris, along with her grandmother, Katherine Jackson, and her brothers, Prince and Blanket, are suing AEG Live for liability in Michael Jackson's 2009 drug overdose death. Paris and Prince are listed as witness in the Los Angeles trial and have been expected to testify in the wrongful death trial later this month. Jackson trial lawyer Kevin Boyle spoke to reporters outside of court Wednesday afternoon, saying Paris can decide if she will testify during their part of the case, but AEG Live has subpoenaed her, calling her a key witness. ""The Jackson family and the Jackson lawyers are putting no pressure on Paris regarding this case at all,"" Boyle said. ""It is AEG who is putting this case at Paris' back door."" Paris and Prince were questioned separately over two days by AEG lawyers just before the trial began in April. ""A grilling of a child regarding the loss of her father is going to create a lot of pressure,"" Boyle said. ""Paris Jackson was asked intimate details about her father and her father's death; it was a very intense situation."" AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putnam denied his team was tough on Paris Jackson in her deposition. ""I don't think anybody in the world could call it a grilling."" He declined to say he would not call her as a witness if she does not testify during the Jacksons' case. ""We have to know what they're putting on as a case before we decide what our defense will be,"" Putnam said. ""I have no idea who we're going to call."" Paris made millions cry four years ago when she spoke up at the end of the public memorial service for her father. ""Ever since I was born, daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine,"" she said, fighting back tears as relatives consoled her. ""And I just want to say that I love him so much,"" she said as she burst into tears and sought refuge in the embrace of family members. Paris questioned about dad's death in lawsuit . Paris was recently reunited with her mother, who bowed out of her life when she was an infant. She has been spending time with Debbie Rowe on her horse farm. Rowe issued a statement through her lawyer Wednesday morning: ""We appreciate everyone's thoughts for Paris at this time and their respect for the family's privacy.""","NEW: AEG Live asked Paris Jackson ""intimate details about her father in a deposition,"" lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- True confession. On the first day of school this year, I got swept up in all the back-to-school cuteness and violated my family's policy of not sharing pictures and videos of our girls online. I couldn't resist. I had to post one picture on Facebook, but I figured a shot of my daughters from behind carrying backpacks nearly their size would be OK. That decision -- to share or not to share -- is a bit of a conundrum for anyone with kids. On the one hand, many parents want their friends and family, and sometimes a larger audience, to see how fabulous their kids are. On the other hand, there are concerns about a child's privacy and safety online. There is always that chance, as remote as it might seem, that what you post will be seen by millions. That's what happened to Blake Wilson, a father of four in Roswell, Georgia, who, on a whim, bought a ""Batman"" mask, and started creating hilarious Vine videos, where he appears as ""BatDad,"" stepping in to solve modern parenting woes. ""It was a total fluke,"" said Wilson from his home, where he has been fielding interview requests from outlets around the world. ""I wasn't thinking about going viral."" Now that he has -- with millions of hits on YouTube and national exposure including on the ""TODAY"" show -- I wondered if Wilson had any second thoughts about sharing videos of his children that have now been seen worldwide. How to cut your kids' cell phone addiction . ""Not yet because I don't think any of it's inappropriate,"" said Wilson, who added that he and his wife scrutinize every Vine video they make before posting. ""If I were doing something that was embarrassing (the kids) and making them feel bad and I put it on the Internet, then yeah, I would feel pretty bad about myself and regret doing that. But I really don't think that I've done anything to put them in any kind of future harm or jeopardy at this point and I don't plan on it, either."" David DeVore posted a video in 2009 of his son, also named David, who was still woozy after dental surgery. The video has now been seen more than 121 million times. ""That first week, it was kind of shocking and we were trying to navigate, 'Well, what is going on here? Are they criticizing David, or are they making fun of him?' "" DeVore said, recalling the moment the video became a sensation. ""That was really the only time we thought 'Well, maybe we should take it down' ... not realizing like we do now that once it's out, it's kind of out."" In conversations with parents across the country, it's clear how seriously families like Wilson's and DeVore's take the issue of what they share about their children, and how every household has its own set of rules about what's acceptable and what's not. A fine line not to cross . Sharon Rowley, founder of the blog Mom of 6, said her children may appear in some pictures and videos on her blog, but she said she'll never share anything about their personal lives. ""I don't feel that their personal life is really my story to tell,"" said Rowley, who said she would never post anything controversial about her kids. ""Nothing ever that I think they would cringe and say, 'Why would you tell people that?' You are not talking to your neighbor across the fence. You are talking to strangers when you write about it like that."" Emily, a blogger in coastal North Carolina who only wanted to use her first name, said she tries to paint a really ""abstract"" picture of her 18-month-old online, which means putting up pictures on her blog that obscure her daughter's face a bit and being cautious about the stories she tells. ""When I write about her, I like to make sure that I don't share any details that she'll later on take offense at because she's a person and I think that that's something I have to remember a lot,"" she said with a laugh. ""I don't want her to feel hindered by the way I portrayed her on the Internet when she was a child."" Opinion: 'Facebook parenting' is destroying our children's privacy . No longer sharing . Jennifer Bosse, who blogs about motherhood and marriage, shares pictures and videos of her two boys mostly on Facebook because her family lives far away. ""I really try to make sure that the security on ... my Facebook is down (pat). I know it's not going to be foolproof but I do take certain precautions to protect their privacy as well as my own,"" she added. ""I try to keep the number of friends that I have to a minimum."" Bosse said she has always been choosy about what photos of her children she shares on her blog, but said she became even more selective after reading a story on BlogHer about a blogger who shared photos of her children during potty training. She later found out the photos were used on a child pornography site. ""It just got me really, really nervous because I had already posted all these pictures and granted they're just regular pictures that you would see around my house, kids smiling, kids playing on bikes,"" Bosse said. ""I really do try to watch everything that I put out there for the fear that it might end up in the wrong hands."" Parents should definitely consider the ""icky factor,"" according to Larry Magid, co-director of ConnectSafely.org and founder of SafeKids.com, both nonprofit Internet safety organizations. He spoke of a friend who posts pictures of her 3-year-old running around in her underwear. ""We have pictures like that of our own children but we don't post them on the Internet for the public to look at because even though they are taken with the best intentions and shared with the best intentions, there are creeps out there who are going to get the wrong idea,"" he said. Never too early to teach the kids . Nicole Feliciano, founder and editor of the style blog Mom Trends, said she sticks out from a lot of her fellow bloggers because she never shares photos and videos of her girls, ages 5 and 8. As her older daughter starts to do more things online, Feliciano has been using social media to help explain why she and her husband are so adamant that the children not be showcased on her site. The secret life of my sixth grader . ""I show her how a screenshot works,"" Feliciano said. ""I said, 'Let's show this picture up on Mom Trends and then I'm going to take the screenshot. If I take this post down, this screenshot still exists and I can send it to all of my friends, and I can put it up on Twitter. I can put it on Facebook and even though you've deleted it, it still exists.' "" ""We're trying to use social media education for them as well ... so they know about permanence and about being very responsible with every image that you put up."" Online 'eraser' button . The lives of modern parents are more complicated by having to add social media training to the list of things we need to do to keep our children safe, Feliciano said. So what's a parent to do? Magid, the Internet safety expert, said parents should check their privacy settings for any online service they use to make sure something they only want to share with friends is not being seen by the general public. He also said parents need to keep reiterating one message to their kids: ""Not to put anything online that you wouldn't want your grandmother or future love interest or future employer (or a future college administrator) to know."" But beyond that, he said parents can't really rely on themselves, software companies or even the government to keep children safe online. Opinion: Oops! Button lets kids erase posts they regret . For instance, a new California law went into effect last week, the first law of its kind in the nation, that will allow kids under 18 to have the power to delete something they posted. The problem, said Magid and other parents, is that if someone shares something your child posted that your child now wants to delete, your kid is out of luck. Also, the new law doesn't protect childlren from any photos or posts that their friends or enemies post about them. ""The danger is not even so much what you've taken and shown the world, but it's what other people have tagged you in or stupid things you did (and) you didn't even know anyone had a camera,"" Rowley said. ""So it really comes down to parents. We really have to teach morals, ethics, how to live your life with integrity."" Emily, the mom and blogger from North Carolina, put it another way. ""You have to parent online,"" she said. ""You have to sit down with your kids and explain what they're getting into.""

"(CNN) -- Good news: We're not going to war in Syria, at least not right away. Bad news: We're headed to a battle inside Congress that will pose its own grave threat to the U.S. and world economy. The most conservative Republicans in Congress are threatening to force default on the nation's obligations unless the president agrees to defund Obamacare. Less conservative Republicans prefer a milder version of the threat: not default, but merely shutting down the government. Either way, the country plunges into crisis -- a crisis Republicans must eventually lose, as they have lost every previous round of this same game. It's way past time for Republicans to find a better way. These doomed all-or-nothing battles over Obamacare perversely strengthen President Obama. As Republicans exhaust themselves in grand debates, Obamacare fastens itself ever more tightly upon the country and the states. Obamacare offers large benefits to many Americans, and benefits once extended are very difficult to remove. That should have been the lesson of 2012, and unless Republicans get wiser, it'll be the repeat lesson of 2016. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. A core feature of Obama's health plan will go into effect in bare weeks -- and all the law's flaws continue unaddressed. The Republican challenge is to protect the country from those flaws, by concentrating on the reforms that matter most: . 1) Control Obamacare's costs; . 2) Share Obamacare's burdens more widely. Take No. 1 first. America used to have two health care cost problems: the cost of the health care system to the total economy, and the cost of health care programs to government budgets. Those two costs were related, but distinct. One example: Before Obamacare, a proposal to raise the Medicare qualification age to 67 would have saved the government money, without changing any real economic costs. As Obamacare goes into effect, those two costs merge into one. Raise the Medicare age to 67, and Medicare's costs may fall -- but other program costs will rise. An increase in health care costs anywhere will flow directly into an increase in government health care spending. If Republicans want to control the cost of government, they have to change their thinking from ""cut government budgets"" to ""reform health care delivery."" To date, U.S. health care markets have done a poor job of controlling health care costs. That hasn't been a failure Republicans worried much about -- but they had better start, because if markets continue to fail, the alternatives will be ever more voracious health care costs or direct government control. Now problem No. 2: burden-sharing. Obamacare purports to finance itself with taxes only on upper-income Americans. The revenues from these taxes will be inadequate just as a matter of arithmetic. Worse, this mode of finance corrodes all political incentive for cost control. Not many voters will deprive themselves of a benefit to save somebody else money. If Obamacare is to be part of America's future -- which is how the betting must run today -- this program that claims to benefit all should be paid for by all, as Social Security and Medicare are paid for by all. Back in 2010, Democrats desperate for Republican support would happily have accepted a broader tax mechanism. Today, of course, they have less incentive to deal. Their voters do well out of Obamacare; the costs are borne by those Americans most likely to vote Republican. But there are revenue measures Democrats would value even more highly than they value taxes on the affluent: carbon taxes, for example. A Republican plan to tax work and investment less and to tax carbon more -- and to use such taxes to support health care costs -- would appeal to Democrats, and would unite both Democrats and Republicans in a shared commitment to health care cost control. These are real-world political tradeoffs. They are less exciting than the grand drama of repeal-or-bust. But repeal-or-bust is much more likely to produce a bust than a repeal. More productive is the challenge of reforming Obamacare so that the nation can live with its costs -- and so that all equitably shoulder their share of its burdens. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: GOP effort to defund Obama's health plan is going nowhere .
He says it makes more sense to focus on the key flaws of Obamacare .
Republicans should push to make sure the plan has cost-control features, he says .
He says it makes sense to broaden funding so most Americans pay for it ."
"(CNN) -- I walked into the Gallery of African Art (GAFRA) on London's Cork Street in Mayfair two weeks ago. Opposite the Burlington Arcade, right at the heart of the art establishment, on gallery row itself, African art formerly seen as a niche interest, now officially playing with the big boys. And the best thing ... GAFRA is owned and run by a woman: Liberian born Bendu Cooper. Just down the road in Oxford Circus is Tiwani Contemporary, a gallery that specializes in Nigerian art, also run by a woman, this time Maria Varnava who spent her childhood in West Africa. Tiwani partners with the Centre for Contemporary Art in Lagos, again run by another woman, Bisi Silva. It would appear that women are at the vanguard of raising the profile of contemporary African art. And for those who may point out that three female curators do not a trend make, name checks to Chief Nike Okundaye, Touria El Glaoui and Rakeb Sile to list a few. If female curators are a rarity, Africa-focused female curators are even more so. Yet the message of these women is not a gendered manifesto but a simple statement of fact: contemporary African art exists. Not only does it exist, it thrives. Not only does it thrive, it does pretty well at auctions, as the annual Bonham's 'Africa Now' auction attests to. Read this: Dakar Biennale brings African art to world stage . Growing up, my conception of African art was limited to ivory masks and wooden sculptures. Art was what our ancestors did. African artists were dead and anonymous. A quick browse on the Wikipedia 'African art' entry does much to confirm this outmoded view. The page boasts a smiling mysterious mask from Gabon, a bellicose Ife bronze head from the 12th century and a Nok terracotta sculpture from the 6th century BC. The deader the better where the African artist is concerned it seems. Yet African art is alive. One cannot view the pulsating wall length panels of Victor Ehikhamenor, or the playful metal work of Sokari Douglas Camp and declare these pieces artifacts. Nor view the sculptures of GonÃ§alo Mabunda made from recycled AK47s and say these are artists working with only traditional materials. Nor listen to the acoustic art of Emeka Ogboh and say this new generation is confined to the usual mediums. The art coming from Africa today is as varied, vibrant, exhilarating and bewildering as contemporary art from anywhere in the world. And not only is this art alive, it is for the first time, moving through proper distribution channels. No more the European treasure hunter, grabbing sacred artifacts, sacking sacred temples and carting off the spoils to institutions like the British Museum and the Louvre. Instead today, the business-like curator, the technologically savvy artist, with work cleared through customs on both ends and profits split sensibly. This unfolding success story of contemporary African art comes at a good time for the continent. No matter what one might say of the trajectory of some African governments, there is no doubt that African culture is on the rise. First the rise of afro-pop music (D'banj, Fuse) then the rise of the African actor (Lupita N'yongo, Chiwetel Ejiofor) and now perhaps the rise of the contemporary African artist (Victor Ehikhamenor, Tamrat Gezahegn) . To the female curators at the forefront of the movement, I salute you. And to the public, grab their works while you can. Read this: Dakar Biennale brings African art to world stage .

"(CNN) -- It was the annual gathering of the geeks in the city that never sleeps. After an attendance of 116,000 in 2012, New York Comic Con tickets were sold out this year, as crowds lined up to attend panels, meet their favorite sci-fi/fantasy celebrities and comic book creators and show off their latest cosplay (or costume play) creations. Despite a controversy on the first day of the convention on Thursday -- in which the Con tweeted on behalf of attendees on their own Twitter accounts -- it appeared that the enthusiasm of fans did not let up with long lines over the rest of the weekend. The convention ceased that particular Twitter practice on Friday. ""It's a little more intimate than some of the larger Cons,"" said veteran convention attendee and iReporter Rene Carson. ""I just got out of a panel for David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, and it was really easy to get into. With the others [conventions], you can't get into those [kind of panels] without waiting for hours and hours."" Aside from Duchovny and Anderson's 20th anniversary reunion, there were many other big events. The smash hit TV series ""The Walking Dead"" announced two new actors joining their cast, Michael Cudlitz (in attendance) and Josh McDermitt, both playing characters from the popular comic book. A ""10th season"" of the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" comic book was confirmed with a new creative team, and a fourth season of MTV's ""Teen Wolf"" series was announced. DC Comics talked up their 2014 weekly series, ""Batman: Eternal."" And Marvel Comics finally confirmed that it would reprint the classic 1980s series ""Miraclemen,"" alongside announcing new series starring ""Silver Surfer,"" ""Punisher"" and ""Ghost Rider.""

"(CNN) -- A North Dakota woman who police say was using Facebook on her cellphone when she crashed into another car is accused of negligent homicide in the death of a great-grandmother during the May accident. Abby Sletten, 20, appeared in Traill County District Court on Wednesday to face a count of negligent homicide, court documents said. Sletten is accused of driving 85 mph on a North Dakota highway May 27 while using her cellphone when her car rear-ended an SUV. Jennifer Meyers was driving the SUV with her daughter and 89-year-old grandmother, according to an affidavit. A witness told police he saw Meyers' brake lights and turn signal when Sletten's Ford Escape plowed into the car on Interstate 29. Sletten did not brake and nearly hit the witness' vehicle after striking Meyers' SUV, according to the affidavit. Meyers' grandmother, Phyllis Gordon, a Minnesota resident, was a passenger in the front seat and died on the scene, the affidavit said. Meyers and her daughter Paige, who also live in Minnesota, were treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, the court documents said. Investigators later obtained a warrant to search Sletten's phone and determined she was looking at photos on her mobile Facebook app at the time of the crash, according to the affidavit. She had also sent text messages while driving. The lack of skid marks on the road suggested Sletten did not see Meyers' car in front of her, the documents said. Police obtained a warrant and arrested Sletten on August 27. North Dakota Highway Patrol Capt. Bryan Niewind said it is against state law to compose or read electronic messages while driving. Although many car accidents happen because of distracted driving, it's difficult to determine whether cellphone usage is the cause unless officials are able to search the suspect's phone, as they did in Sletten's case, Niewind said. ""We do get behind vehicles and all of a sudden they're weaving on the road,"" Traill County Sheriff Mike Crocker told CNN affiliate KVLY/KXJB. ""We do initiate a traffic stop and try to find out what's going on. Texting and driving to me ... is becoming a very serious problem."" The North Dakota texting and driving law, enacted in 2011, prohibits drivers from reading, writing and sending electronic messages, including email, KVLY/KXJB reported. The law carries a $100 fine, but Crocker said a tougher law was needed. ""We gotta have a reason for them to not text and drive,"" the sheriff told KVLY/KXJB. According to a 2011 survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drivers between 18 and 20 have the ""highest incidence of crash or near-crash experience,"" and report the highest level of phone involvement at the time of a crash or near crash. At least half the drivers said talking on a phone made no difference in how they drive. Two out of 10 drivers said they drove more slowly when talking on the phone, according to the NHTSA survey. Sletten, a resident of Hatton, is to appear in court October 8. Her lawyer, Bruce Quick, declined to comment. Traill County State Prosecuting Attorney Stuart Larson was out of town and unavailable for comment. According to Paulette Bowersox, clerk of Traill County District Court, bail was set at $5,000.

"(CNN) -- George Clooney sees no reason to keep his upcoming nuptials hush-hush. At a celebrity charity event in Tuscany, Italy over the weekend, the 53-year-old actor spilled a few details about his impending marriage to British human rights attorney Amal Alamuddin. According to People magazine, Clooney was receiving a humanitarian award at the black-tie gala, and said during his acceptance speech, ""I met my lovely bride-to-be here in Italy, whom I will be marrying, in a couple of weeks, in Venice, of all places."" The actor was of course accompanied at the soiree, called Celebrity Fight Night, by his 36-year-old fiancee. With Clooney's documented penchant for pranks, it'll be interesting to see whether he was telling the truth about his wedding plans -- or perhaps just playing a joke on any eager paparazzi. Since the couple became engaged in the spring, they've been largely protective of their relationship. When a Daily Mail report claimed that Clooney and his future mother-in-law were at odds, Clooney blasted the publication with a first-person piece in USA Today, and then refused to accept the Daily Mail's subsequent apology.","George Clooney let a few wedding details slip over the weekend .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles is known as the nation's capital of many things. Entertainment. Gangs. Even the creative capital of the world. Add this: The City of Angels is now the nation's ""epicenter"" for money laundering by international drug cartels. Federal officials made such an announcement this week after they raided downtown businesses and seized an estimated $100 million in cash and from bank accounts around the world that were part of forfeiture actions in the ongoing probe. Some of the laundered money included ransom payments to the Sinaloa drug cartel that allegedly kidnapped and tortured a U.S. citizen at a ranch in Mexico. ""Los Angeles has become the epicenter of narco-dollar money laundering with couriers regularly bringing duffel bags and suitcases full of cash to many businesses,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert E. Dugdale said. California Attorney General Kamala Harris also was blunt. ""California is the gateway to the rest of the United States,"" Harris said. ""California is and always will be an attractive target for these kinds of activities because we have the largest population of any state in the United States. The seventh-largest economy in the world."" Use of peso brokers . The cartels used a scheme known as ""trade-based money laundering"" or ""black market peso exchange,"" federal officials said. On Wednesday, 1,000 law officers swept through a section of downtown Los Angeles known as the ""fashion district,"" which is known more for its dense bazaar-like maze of shops than for any catwalks or haute couture. Authorities initially seized $65 million, but the figure grew Thursday to more than $100 million, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for federal prosecutors. In the ""Operation Fashion Police"" raids, nine people were arrested in the investigation into laundering drug proceeds for cartels, authorities said. Three of the arrests were among seven individuals facing federal indictments for alleged conspiracy to launder money and other charges; the other three defendants are from a business in the Mexican state of Sinaloa and are being sought, authorities said. The defendants' attorneys couldn't be reached for comment. ""We have targeted money-laundering activities in the fashion district based on a wealth of information that numerous businesses there are engaged in black market peso exchange schemes,"" Dugdale said. Kent Smith, executive director of the LA Fashion District, told the Los Angeles Times that 4,000 businesses generate billions in economic activity each year. ""It's unfair to paint the rest of the legitimate businesses ... with what a small number of businesses may be doing in terms of illegal activity,"" Smith told the Times. An $18 billion sector of downtown . Authorities also say the ""vast majority"" of L.A.'s $18 billion garment district is legitimate and operates lawfully. But the federal crackdown clearly ""portend(s) a profoundly troubling trend,"" said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit in Los Angeles. ""The scope of this current case and its potential long-term impact are truly unprecedented,"" Arnold said. A major tipoff to the illegal activity came when the Sinaloa drug cartel used a fashion district firm as a conduit to launder and accept ransom for the release of a U.S. drug dealer who was kidnapped and tortured by narco thugs. ""The victim was held captive at a ranch in Sinaloa, where he was beaten, shot, electrocuted and water-boarded. The hostage was released after relatives paid $140,000 in ransom"" through the fashion district business, authorities said in a statement. The raids capped a two-year investigation, and Attorney General Harris called ""transnational gangs"" like those behind money laundering ""the number one threat to California's public safety."" How it worked . Under the scheme, a peso broker would work with a U.S.-based drug dealer or another conspirator who needs to send dollars to Mexico or another country, authorities said. To do so, the broker would find businesses in Mexico that buy goods from U.S.-based firms such as those in the Los Angeles' fashion district. The Mexican merchants would send dollars to the Los Angeles fashion district stores, authorities said. In return, the fashion shops sent goods to the Mexico businesses, which then sold the products and gave the proceeds in pesos to the broker and eventually the cartels, authorities said. Cartels allegedly use the scheme to avoid ""the risk of smuggling bulk amounts of U.S. currency across the Mexican border and without having to convert and wire the U.S. currency through established financial institutions, which not only carries transaction fees, but also a threat their illegal activity will be detected,"" prosecutors said in a statement. ""It also gives them a presence in the United States they otherwise wouldn't have, indeed a presence in our business industry,"" Dugdale said. Also, in June 2010, Mexico announced anti-money laundering regulations ""that restrict the amount of physical cash denominated in U.S. dollars that Mexican banks may receive,"" a grand jury indictment said.

"(CNN) -- A winter storm packing heavy snow and gusty winds forced authorities to close 180 miles of Interstate 40 in northern Arizona on Sunday until further notice. The road was closed in both directions about 6:30 a.m. (9:30 a.m. ET), said David Beck, dispatch supervisor for the Flagstaff office of the Arizona Highway Patrol. The closure stretched roughly from Kingman in western Arizona to eastward to Winslow, including the city of Flagstaff, he said. Portions of Interstate 17 south of Flagstaff were also closed, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation's website, as were several state roads. As of 9 a.m. Sunday, Flagstaff -- with an elevation of about 6,900 feet -- had received 10 to 14 inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service. The city of Prescott had received 8 to 12 inches. Areas above 7,000 feet could see up to 22 inches, according to the weather service. Several crashes and reports of stuck vehicles had been reported as of Sunday morning, Beck said, with one person sustaining minor injuries on I-40. The Flagstaff Unified School District said its schools would be closed Monday. Northern Arizona University said its Flagstaff campus would be closed Monday, and Coconino Community College said its Flagstaff and Page campuses would be closed. Much of Arizona remained under a winter weather advisory or a winter storm warning on Sunday. The warning was in effect until midnight Sunday. In addition to heavy snow, wind gusts of up to 30 mph were forecast for the Flagstaff area, according to the National Weather Service. CNN's Maggie Schneider and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","NEW: Flagstaff schools and colleges announce Monday closures .

"(CNN) -- A late goal from Pedro Rodriguez, with just five minutes remaining of extra time, gave Barcelona a 1-0 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk in the European Super Cup final in Monaco on Friday. Pedro Rodriguez celebrates scoring the only goal as Barcelona lifted the European Super Cup. The annual match between the winners of the Champions League and UEFA Cup, have rarely been classics and this was no exception on a poor quality pitch at the Stade Louis II stadium. Shakhtar did not create a single opening in normal time while Barca at least showed some intent in a match of few chances. Thierry Henry has a snapshot that flew just over the crossbar while a quick free-kick from Xavi saw Lionel Messi sting the fingers of Andriy Pyatov in the Shakhtar goal -- and the keeper recovered quickly to deny the lurking Henry. If the first half had been disappointing, there was little to lift spirits in the second. Messi hit a fierce left-foot effort that Pyatov could only parry, and when the ball drifted out to Henry by the left touchline he took deliberate aim to loop a shot into the far corner but the Shakhtar keeper climbed just high enough to turn it over. In the 98th minute, Victor Valdes made his first save, diving low to keep out Julius Aghahowa's goal-bound shot. Bojan Krkic, on for Henry, could have wrapped it up with two chances before, having barely threatened, the Ukrainians were denied a blatant penalty when Ilsinho was felled. Shakhtar coach Mircea Luscescu stormed onto the pitch in fury but it was all in vain as Messi's brilliant pass set up Rodriguez for the latest of winners.","A goal from Pedro Rodriguez gives Barcelona a 1-0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk .

""She was found unresponsive by a family member"" in her Houston-area home, manager Chris Roe said. Burns' acting career began with a small role in Robert Altman's ""Brewster McCloud,"" which was filmed in her hometown of Houston in 1970, according to her biography published in 2009 when she was inducted into the International Horror & Sci-Fi Film Festival Hall of Fame. She was a University of Texas student when she landed the role of Sally Hardesty, the sole survivor in the first ""Chainsaw"" film in 1974. ""Chainsaw"" director Tobe Hooper also cast Burns in ""Eaten Alive"" in 1977. She played ""a vacationer who unwittingly stumbles upon a hotel run by a madman who feeds his guests to his pet alligator,"" the biography said. Her other horror movie roles include ""Brutes and Savages"" (1977), ""Caution: Children at Play"" (1981), ""Kiss Daddy Goodbye"" (1981) and ""Future-Kill"" (1985).

"(CNN) -- The final game of one of the most memorable matches in Wimbledon history, featuring two fan favorites, took on a life of its own. Back in 2001 -- in the 16th game of the fifth set -- members of Goran Ivanisevic's entourage asked for divine intervention as the Croatian sought to close out the encounter against Australia's Patrick Rafter and end years of Wimbledon heartache. Ivanisevic himself asked for help from above, he wanted the same ball when serving, and Australian and Croatian spectators on Centre Court roared encouragement between points to make for a football like atmosphere. Ivanisevic had lost three previous Wimbledon finals and seemed destined to miss out on glory at the All England Club given he had struggled with a shoulder injury earlier in 2001 and contemplated retirement. His ranking of 125th wasn't even high enough to land direct entry into the tournament. Wimbledon gave Ivanisevic a wildcard, however, and he proceeded to work his way through the draw with a little help from Wimbledon's famed and all too frequent rain gods. So there he was against Rafter on ""People's Monday,"" leading 8-7 in the fifth set, four points from winning the most prestigious tennis tournament in the world. No ordinary player -- and character -- one sensed that if Ivanisevic held serve, he would do it the hard way. He had to overcome a resilient Rafter -- and painful memories of defeats to Pete Sampras, twice, and Andre Agassi. It proved to be the case. A forehand volley went long by a large margin for 0-15. At 15-all, he double faulted. Having hit an ace to get to championship point, he subsequently double faulted again -- by a yard. A second championship point came and went with another double fault, this time into the net, and a third was saved by Rafter with a lob that was good enough against an Ivanisevic too frozen to jump. Rafter finally buckled on a fourth match point, the pressure from Ivanisevic's destructive serve finally too much to repel. A return sailed into the net and Ivanisevic was the Wimbledon champion and the only wildcard to bag the men's title at noted postcode SW19. Dedication to a fallen friend . He worked his way into his players' box and exchanged hugs with his team, which included father Srdjan, who had recently undergone a triple heart bypass. Ivanisevic dedicated the victory to former NBA star Drazen Petrovic, who died in a car accident in 1993. ""The best moment is when you hold the trophy,"" Ivanisevic told CNN's Open Court before the start of Wimbledon. This year's men's final will be played on Sunday. ""I was watching too many guys holding that beautiful trophy. I had this (runner-up) plate at home,"" added Ivanisevic. ""It's a nice plate but you don't want to have that plate at home. ""Nobody cares for second place. If you want to go back now and think of Wimbledon finalists in the past 15 years, to be honest, I have no idea."" Ivanisevic almost didn't get that far. He trailed Britain's Tim Henman two sets to one in the semifinals, losing the third 6-0 in about 15 minutes. He was out of sorts. That's when the unpredictable British weather saved Ivanisevic and hurt the local darling. With Henman holding a 2-1 advantage in the fourth set on the second Friday of the fortnight, rain fell and the contest was suspended. They returned Saturday and Ivanisevic, mentally fresher, claimed the fourth set in a tiebreak. A further suspension ensured the nervy affair had to be completed Sunday, with Ivanisevic eliminating Henman 6-3 in the fifth to disappoint a nation. A Monday final beckoned against Rafter, himself a loser to Sampras -- the king of Wimbledon prior to Roger Federer's arrival -- in the 2000 finale. Fans queued up overnight to land one of the 10,000 unreserved tickets made available for the final, leading to a more vocal climax than usual. ""It was good that it was on a Monday because three finals I lost on Sunday, so finally I played on Monday,"" Ivanisevic said. ""Unbelievable atmosphere, probably never again because now they have a roof. ""Patrick is a very good friend, a great guy. We both should have won Wimbledon before, him in 2000 in the final, and I was supposed to win a long time ago."" After Ivanisevic beat Carlos Moya in the second round he sensed something special was about to happen. Did it the hard way . Besides Henman and Rafter, Ivanisevic also topped Andy Roddick, Greg Rusedski and Marat Safin in a difficult draw. Of his seven victims, only one -- first-round opponent Fredrik Jonsson -- would never feature in the top four in the rankings. ""It was an unsolved mystery how I won, but I felt after the second round that I was going to win,"" Ivanisevic said. ""I could not say it loud because they would think I was completely nuts. ""I felt for the first time after so many months, actually a year, the racket (that I played with had a special sound). I lost the sound for a year and a half and that (first) Monday I got the sound back. I said, 'This is a good sign.'"" The sound had vanished when Ivanisevic began the year by playing in qualifying at the Australian Open. Stuck on a back court after playing in some of the world's grandest stadiums, he tanked -- a tennis term for not trying. Although unpleasant at the time, it proved to be that year's turning point for Ivanisevic. ""I had a long journey to think about what I was going to do, then I went to play a challenger in Germany,"" Ivanisevic said. ""I played the final. Then I started to play better. I didn't have great results but I started to enjoy it again. ""Wimbledon came and it was actually my time,"" added Ivanisevic, who can still be seen on the seniors' tour, while he also helps run a tournament in Zagreb and dabbles in commentating. ""It was written somewhere that it was my time. I did everything in my life the harder way. Why do it easy if you can do it the hard way?"" But by doing it the hard way, the larger-than-life Ivanisevic has ensured his achievement at Wimbledon will never be forgotten.","Twelve years after his Wimbledon triumph, Goran Ivanisevic isn't sure how he won .

"(CNN) -- It always made me laugh to hear stories about the insanity that would go on between Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried during the making of the movie ""Aladdin."" The truth was Robin and I didn't bump into each other once during the making of that film. I recorded the Parrot role, and he recorded the Genie separately. So when I saw the film for the first time at the premiere, I was able to laugh along with the rest of the audience at Robin's performance. I had never heard it before. Where I did run into Robin quite often was in the place where he was most at home, in the comedy clubs. Robin would pop into places like Catch a Rising Star and the Improv in New York, would run onstage and just explode. I remember in particular one night, back in those days, when he was hot from his TV hit, ""Mork and Mindy,"" and I wasn't yet well-known. I was just building a reputation in comedy circles, and I was about to go up onstage at the Improv. I was standing in the section right outside the restroom where the comics waited to be introduced onstage. All of a sudden, the club door opened and Robin popped in. The people in charge of the club said, ""OK, we're putting Robin on next."" I couldn't really argue with that; he was certainly a bigger name than I was. But to my amazement, Robin told them, ""I have a bunch of people in the audience tonight, and I would really like to make sure they see Gilbert first."" Opinion: Robin Williams can't be dead . I went up onstage. I did quite well and as I walked offstage, Robin came up to me wiping his eyes from laughing and said to me, ""Oh Gilbert, you really baked my cookies."" I of course took this as a strange sexual double entendre, and I always do, but Robin meant it as a sincere compliment. He was a fixture of the comedy club scene back then, one of the celebs who'd pop in to try out material, or in Robin's case, just burst out with any craziness that would pop into his head. But he was also generous to his fellow stand-up comedians: There were a number of times when Robin was onstage and I was at the club, and he would call out to me and invite me to play with him onstage. Riffing with Robin Williams was extremely invigorating -- and extremely exhausting. I knew I had to be on my toes every second. And when we would actually connect onstage, it was electric for me. Patients' families remember Robin Williams as 'comedic Mother Teresa' To see Robin perform was an experience. He was more than a comedian. He was a comedy force of nature. I remember hearing that Robin was once doing a press junket in Germany. One of the reporters asked him, ""Why is it that Germany is not known for comedy?"" Robin answered, ""Well, you killed all your funny people."" I laughed out loud when I heard that. I thought, how sick and how wonderfully truthful. When I heard the news of Robin's passing, it was a double shock. It was stunning that he was now gone and that, according to police, it was apparently suicide. I've known people who have committed suicide, and my shock always reveals how little I knew about them. Robin had spoken in the press about his substance abuse issues over the years, and he was dealing with it in rehab. I had heard at one point he was prescribed pills and that he didn't want to take them because he was afraid it would interfere with his comic creativity. I thought, when I heard that, of his idol, Jonathan Winters. Robin worshipped the comedian, who died last year. Winters had his own problems and also was afraid medicating would interfere with his comic creativity. Complete coverage on Robin Williams . I can't say that I had a close relationship with Robin -- it was mainly kibitzing back and forth in the clubs. The few times we'd have a conversation that would become serious, he or both of us would quickly veer off into jokes or silliness. Now, in retrospect, it may have been that Robin joked so much and was always ""on"" perhaps to hide something. Of course, that's just dime-store psychology. The last memory I have of him was a benefit that comedian Bob Saget was organizing at the comedy club Carolines on Broadway to raise consciousness about scleroderma. It was a fun night. Jimmy Fallon was there performing, as was Robin and myself. After the show, Billy Crystal stopped by. He had been doing a show and was unable to make the benefit. He and Robin greeted each other. Then Robin came over and spoke to me. We chatted for a little bit, and Robin said to me, ""Would you like to join us? We're going out for dessert."" The three of us went to one of these showbiz bar-restaurants in Times Square. It was the middle of the night, and we sat eating our desserts and exchanging comedy showbiz stories, memories and anecdotes. There was a lot of laughing -- a good time. On our way out of the place, we passed by another table where, surprisingly, comedy great Mel Brooks was sitting. I didn't know Mel, so Billy and Robin both approached him and were talking to him, and I stood off to the side. Robin Williams and the dark side of comedy . Robin went out of his way to tell Mel how funny I was at the benefit. He repeated some of my jokes and Mel laughed. This was once again Robin proving what a generous person he was. Later, out in the street as he got in a cab, Billy yelled to me, half-jokingly, but quite truthfully, ""I guess we'll talk in another 30 years."" I was left on the dark street with Robin. He told me he was going to a meeting for substance abuse. We said one or two more things and laughed and then we hugged each other. Afterward, Robin warmly said, ""Bye,"" and I stood there as he turned around and walked off into the darkness.","Gilbert Gottfried and Robin Williams did voices for ""Aladdin"" but didn't bump into each other .

"(CNN)  -- The woman who made the 911 call that led to the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. never referred to black suspects when she called authorities for what she thought was a potential break-in. Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested after a break-in was reported to police. Police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, released the 911 phone call Monday. In the call, Lucia Whalen reports seeing ""two larger men, one looked kind of Hispanic, but I'm not really sure, and the other one entered, and I didn't see what he looked like at all."" ""I just saw it from a distance, and this older woman was worried, thinking somebody's breaking in someone's house and they've been barging in,"" Whalen says. ""She interrupted me, and that's when I noticed. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have noticed it at all, to be honest with you. So I was just calling because she was a concerned neighbor, I guess.""  Listen to the entire 911 call » . Attorney Wendy Murphy, who represents Whalen, also categorically rejected part of the police report that said Whalen talked with Sgt. James Crowley, the arresting officer, at the scene. ""Let me be clear: She never had a conversation with Sgt. Crowley at the scene,"" Murphy told CNN by phone. ""And she never said to any police officer or to anybody 'two black men.' She never used the word 'black.' Period."" She added, ""I'm not sure what the police explanation will be. Frankly, I don't care. Her only goal is to make it clear she never described them as black. She never saw their race. ... All she reported was behavior, not skin color."" Calls to the Cambridge Police Department about the issue have not been returned. Police Commissioner Robert Haas told reporters at a news conference Monday that the 911 tape and police transmission from that day ""speak for themselves, and I would ask that you form your own opinion."" He added that police always ask themselves: ""If I had to do it over again, what would I have done differently?"" ""This matter is not resolved,"" Haas said. ""We have a long way to go. We recognize that we are going to take advantage of the situation and we're going to learn from it. We're going to move forward."" In the police report, filed by Crowley, he says he spoke with Whalen outside the home before he approached Gates' house. ""She went on to tell me that she observed what appeared to be two black males with backpacks on the porch of Ware Street,"" the report says. ""She told me that her suspicions were aroused when she observed one of the men wedging his shoulder into the door as if he was trying to force entry."" Murphy also disputed accounts of her client as a white woman in the traditional sense. ""The fact is, she's olive-skinned and of Portuguese descent. You wouldn't look at her and say, necessarily, 'Oh, there's a white woman.' You might think she was Hispanic,"" Murphy said. Murphy's comments add yet another layer of intrigue to the July 16 arrest that has prompted heated discussion across the nation on race relations in America, including President Obama weighing in on the issue. Obama last week first said police ""acted stupidly"" in arresting Gates after he presented identification that showed he lived in the home. But by Friday, the president said that he had spoken with Crowley and that he didn't mean to malign the Police Department. The president acknowledged that his words ""helped to contribute to ratcheting"" up the debate and controversy surrounding the arrest. ""I could have calibrated those words differently, and I told this to Sgt. Crowley,"" Obama said. Obama spoke about two hours after police unions in Massachusetts called on him to apologize. Obama has invited Crowley and Gates to the White House this week for beer. Meanwhile, authorities in Cambridge announced they have created a panel to advise police on racial issues as a result of Gates' arrest. ""I am committed to making sure our city is not defined by that day. Today is the day to move forward,"" City Manager Robert Healy told reporters at Monday's news conference. Watch ""lessons learned"" panel formed » . The committee, led by ""nationally recognized experts,"" will not investigate the arrest of Gates -- one of the nation's most prolific scholars on African-American affairs -- nor will it ""make any judgments"" on the officers involved, Healy said. The committee ""will identify lessons to be taken from the circumstances surrounding the incident"" and will advise the Police Department on how ""those lessons can be applied"" to its policies and practices. ""It's time to move forward and look at lessons learned and go from there,"" Healy said. He also weighed in on the upcoming meeting in Washington between Gates, Crowley and Obama: ""I hope they enjoy their beer at the White House."" The meeting will take place on Thursday, said a senior administration official. Also at the news conference, Cambridge mayor Denise Simmons, who is African-American, said the arrest was a ""turning point for the city."" ""While this has been a trying time for Cambridge, we are confident that we can ultimately come out stronger and more unified,"" she said. ""We see ourselves as America's classroom."" Speaking to CNN by phone, Murphy said she was trying to clear Whalen's name after she's come under attack by bloggers and in chat rooms, accused of racial profiling when she first called police. She said Whalen is ""devastated"" by such characterizations because she is sensitive about such issues because of her own complexion. Whalen worked down the street and was on her lunch break when she called police. ""She just wants to clear her name. She doesn't want to create more controversy,"" Murphy said. ""She falls outside the plain lines of race, and I think she wanted people to know that."" CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: Police release 911 tape from Harvard professor's arrest .

"(CNN) -- The National Rifle Association responded Friday to a chorus of voices calling for gun control in the wake of last week's horrific mass shooting in Connecticut by doubling down on its own position: more guns, not fewer, provide true security. After one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history -- 20 children and seven adults killed, not including the gunman -- polls show that a slight majority of Americans favor restrictions on guns. Conservative Democrats and even some Republicans who have supported gun rights have said they are open to discussing gun control. But the NRA made its position clear: The prominent gun rights organization will not budge an inch toward discussion of gun control. To the contrary, the group announced it will fund a team that will design a program to get armed security personnel on school grounds across the country. ""You know, five years ago, after the Virginia Tech tragedy, when I said we should put armed security in every school, the media called me crazy,"" NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said. But what if the gunman, Adam Lanza, had been confronted by a trained security guard? ""Will you at least admit it's possible that 26 innocent lives might have been spared?"" LaPierre asked. ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" he said. LaPierre's position sets the stage for a contentious battle between the NRA, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in Washington, and the Obama administration, which has promised quick action on ""real reforms"" to gun laws. This week, President Barack Obama tapped Vice President Joe Biden to lead a task force to start formulating those reforms and, with the White House's support, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said she will introduce legislation to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. Gun owners fear new legislation could tread on their rights . The NRA had remained silent in the wake of last week's school massacre as the debate on gun control was shaped by these moves in Washington. That changed Friday when it drew a line in the sand, providing its alternative vision for protecting American children through armed security personnel at all schools. ""Why is the idea of a gun good when it's used to protect the president of our country or our police, but bad when it's used to protect our children in our schools?"" LaPierre asked. ""We need to have every single school in America immediately deploy a protection program proven to work -- and by that I mean armed security,"" he said, reading from a prepared statement. The NRA executive appeared aware that he was staking a bold position in front of a divided public that recent polls suggest is leaning toward tightening gun laws. In case he wasn't, protesters interrupted his address twice, shouting anti-NRA slogans and bearing banners in front of his podium, including one that said ""NRA killing our kids."" LaPierre spoke exactly one week after the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut. Across the nation, church bells rang in remembrance of the victims. The NRA was among those groups that observed a moment of silence at 9:30 a.m., the same time as last week's massacre. Residents in Newtown and across the country paused for a moment of silence in memory of the victims. Many websites went dark momentarily to mark the moment. Funerals for five of the victims -- school psychologist Mary Sherlach, behavioral therapist Rachel Marie D'Avino and students Grace Audrey McDonnell, Olivia Rose Engel and Dylan Christopher Jack Hockley -- also took place Friday. A slight majority of Americans favor major restrictions on guns: 52%, up 5 points from a survey taken in August after the July shooting inside a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, where 12 people died, according to a CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday. More than 195,000 people have signed an online White House petition supporting new gun control legislation. Yet the NRA has support among many Americans who believe that taking steps to limit access to guns is not the answer. One CNN reader summed up the pro-gun argument this way: ""We ... put undercover, plain clothed air marshals on our planes to protect us when we fly. I fully support the same in our schools to protect my children. Every school should have one,"" Ali wrote. ""A cop in every school is a much better solution than a holster on every teacher's belt. But it doesn't go far enough. This is an attempt to contain the problem to schools and avoid the broader discussion,"" another CNN commenter wrote. Parents defend right to keep guns in the home . Others pointed to the apparent contradiction among conservatives who want to reduce public spending but also support the NRA's idea to arm schools. Who will pay for the thousands of armed guards? several CNN readers asked. Many suggested taxes on guns that could fund such a program. Why own a military-style rifle . The NRA envisions a ""National School Shield Emergency Response Program"" where qualified police, military, security personnel and others organize to protect schools. Schools remain a target for criminal gunmen because they are not protected by armed security the way other important institutions are, LaPierre said. Policies banning guns at schools create a place that ""insane killers"" consider ""the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk,"" he said. Former congressman Asa Hutchinson will lead the school security project. Armed personnel will be part of the security model but not the only component, Hutchinson said. ""School safety is a complex issue with no simple, single solution,"" he said. ""But I believe trained, qualified, armed security is one key component among many that can provide the first line of deterrence as well as the last line of defense."" NRA power and money go a long way in states . The NRA, with its roughly 4.3 million members, is the standard bearer for protecting the Second Amendment. It is also the source of hefty campaign donations. During the 2012 election cycle, the NRA donated $719,596 to candidates. Republicans received $634,146 of that, according to the Center for Responsive Politics' analysis of federal campaign data. Some $85,450 went to Democrats, many of them in states that are considered more conservative when it comes to gun control laws. The NRA's point man on its school security study, Hutchinson, received $7,000 from the organization for his 2000 congressional campaign, and $7,450 in 1998.

"(CNN) -- A toy helicopter controlled by nothing but brainwaves could be available to the public just in time to hover under this year's Christmas tree. Currently touted on crowd-funding website Kickstarter -- where it has already exceeded its pledge goal twice over -- the Orbit comes equipped with an electroencephalography (EEG) headset, capable of reading electrical activity along the scalp. ""As you focus your mind on something -- whether it be a math equation or the lyrics of a song -- your brain produces electric signals,"" explains Steve Castellotti, CEO and co-founder of Puzzlebox, the San Francisco-based company behind the project. ""The headset monitors those signals and converts them into flight commands,"" he says. There are future plans to enable multi-directional control, but in its present incarnation signals sent from the brain can only be used to lift the helicopter off the ground. ""When you concentrate, up it goes; when you mentally relax, it comes back down again,"" explains Castellotti. Aside from its obvious entertainment value, Puzzlebox are pitching the Orbit as an educational toy that will help improve concentration and relaxation skills. According to Castellotti, the art of keeping mentally focused is inherently difficult to master. ""If you're learning how to ride a bike, there's a very obvious, physical indication when you improve -- you stop falling off,"" says the 34-year-old computer science graduate. ""It's much harder to know when you're concentrating properly and, to a lesser extent, relaxing, because there is little scope for accurate, real-time feedback."" Castellotti believes that by providing powerful visual reinforcement in the shape of his telekinesis-powered floating sphere, users will become better able to channel their attentions in other tasks. When it goes into mass production at the end of this month, the Orbit will be available in two models. The first is designed to be used with mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones, which connect via Bluetooth to the accompanying EEG headset, and communicate with sensors on board the helicopter. The second model, available later in the year, comes with a Puzzlebox Pyramid. The Pyramid acts as a home base and remote control unit for the Orbit and features a custom-designed, reprogrammable micro-controller. Infrared LEDs lining the rim of the Pyramid send signals to the helicopter. These can also be reprogrammed to control other infrared gadgets. ""So instead of controlling the helicopter, you could modify the programming of the Pyramid to turn the volume up or down on your television,"" Castellotti says. The idea behind the Pyramid is to encourage users to make the transition from a simple consumer to an active participant in the products they buy. ""We want to stimulate curiosity about how it all works, and actively invite anyone who buys the Orbit to take it apart, modify it and reprogram it as they see fit,"" he says. As such, Puzzlebox will also freely distribute all material in relation to the project, from the source code to the hardware schematics to how-to guides for dismantling and reassembling the whole thing. ""Sure, it's a fun toy first and foremost, but once the initial novelty wears off it doesn't have to end up at the bottom of the toy box ... it's yours to reinvent,"" he says.","The Orbit uses electrical brainwave signals to issue flight commands .
San Francisco-based makers Puzzlebox say the toy enhances ability to concentrate .

"(CNN) -- In the not-too-distant future, you'll receive a full diagnosis and cure from your smartphone before you have even realized you're unwell. While this may seem like science fiction, it's on the cusp of becoming a reality. Digital is set to embark on a path of radical transformation in the health and wellness sector and in doing so it will help us to overcome some of the most significant challenges we face in health care. We have an aging society and as elderly people account for a larger share of the population, the prevalence of long-term health problems will increase. This will cause a bigger cost burden and pressure health systems to accommodate an aging workforce. Furthermore, lifestyle-related chronic health problems, including obesity and diabetes, are on the rise with dramatic implications for health service budgets. The cost of supporting these demographic trends is unsustainable but digital services are likely to be part of the solution society is looking for. Tell us: What's your dream smartphone feature? One trend that's captured the imagination of many is ""body hacking"" or understanding the ""quantified self."" Whether it's an app tracking your dietary intake or a wearable band counting the physical activity you undertake each day, these devices provide you with the tools to understand your health immediately based on the data your body has provided. Every individual can benefit from better access to information about their bodies and greater awareness leads to better understanding of the consequences. Little by little this starts to change behaviors. The growth in availability of portable and highly connected health devices will drive an expectation in society to be aware of our own health and more pro-active in the lifestyle choices we make. People will use technology to prevent and diagnose disease, and in some cases, bypass the doctor's clinic by taking health care into their own hands, or at the least go armed to the doctor with helpful diagnostic information. Our informed insight will mean that the doctor's role will change. They will become coaches, rather than a source of initial diagnosis. Self-diagnostic tools will empower doctors to monitor, prevent and treat medical conditions. One early example of this is the ECG attachment for the iPhone, which is already capable of producing medical-grade data. Private health care organizations will tap into health applications and their capacity for diagnosis as a result, and will offer these widely to consumers. Your smartphone will come to know your body better than you know yourself and doctors will provide a health care service based on your measured behavior and key health indicators. Imagine taking a picture of a rash or ailment with your mobile, uploading it to a diagnostic app and receiving a tailored diagnosis based on the information from the picture, coupled with your personal data that the mobile device has already collected. This is the private data driven future we are seriously looking at, both in developed countries with unsustainable health care costs, but also in countries where people do not have affordable access to health care. Although self-diagnostic tools will encourage better knowledge of our health, this brings about a moral conundrum. Firstly, the value of these insights suggests that we will be happy to share our personal data but there is bound to be an element of suspicion. Secondly, if we understand our bodies and lower risk of illness, will the insurance industry reward those who have a healthy lifestyle and punish those who don't? If healthy people are not rewarded with lower insurance costs for their lifestyles, would they argue that they are being penalized for the unhealthy habits of others? Where do we draw the line between what is a lifestyle choice and genetic illness that we have no control over? Currently, health care systems focus primarily on chronic ill health, rather than the preventative measures of living a healthy lifestyle, but this may be the adjustment that both the health care system and insurance companies make as a result of digital health devices. The ultimate health care applications will allow us to monitor our body and use the insight from that data to create an actionable, preventative health solution, such as an individual exercise or nutritional plan, in addition to devising a personal cocktail of medicine. However, in order to ultimately take off, digital health services need to be designed so that they embed into current human behaviors. Devices that are uncomfortable to wear or don't provide simple explanations of data will not be adopted. Usability is key: People want something intuitive and simple. Healthcare solutions must be designed with the user in mind, enabling people to arrive at actionable conclusions based on their personal data. With well designed digital health services and devices, individuals can take ownership of their own lifestyle behavior and health, which in turn will bring about significant economic and social benefits globally. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Curtis.","Smartphones will soon be able to deliver diagnosis and suggest cures even before we know we're ill, says Mark Curtis .
""Body hacking"" tools, such as wearable bands that monitor physical activity, will help improve our health awareness, Curtis says .
Medical monitoring technology will open new area of debate over privacy and the cost of health care insurance ."
"(CNN) -- The letter Jacki Monaco wrote was fraught with emotion: . ""Dear food,"" it began. ""You have given me a reason to live, a cotton candy cloud to land on, a spaghetti pool to swim in, a sweet and sometimes sour pat on the back after long days. You have been my dearest friend and my most painful enemy. My love, my hate, my utter confusion."" It's a letter Monaco still has, though she penned it nearly two years ago at a weight loss retreat. She reads it when she's angry or upset and is starting to think, again, that food can fix whatever is bothering her. ""I was married to food for so long,"" she said. ""That was the only relationship that mattered to me. Every food has its own story."" There's the salad she ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner that tells the story of her summer of starvation. There's the box of Golden Oreos that got her through the aftermath of her college roommate's death. There's the pizza she used to order from the restaurant across the street, the one she could eat by herself in under an hour, with a bowl of pasta on the side and a large piece of cake for dessert. ""Roller coaster"" doesn't even begin to describe Monaco's struggle with her weight. It's a struggle she's learned to accept -- even embrace -- as an important part of her past. ""I don't think people go through huge obstacles to amount to nothing,"" she said. Freshman 15 . At 5 feet 5 inches tall, Monaco kept active with sports in high school, and her weight hovered around 150 pounds. When she wanted to drop a few, she hit the gym with friends. It was fun, casual and never a major focus in her teenage years. In fall 2007, she headed to Emmanuel College in Boston. The dreaded ""freshman 15"" crept up on her, and when she headed home for the summer, Monaco decided to fight the weight gain by counting calories. The first day, she ate sandwiches, pita chips and vegetables. But full, healthy meals soon turned into tiny salads. After a couple weeks, Monaco was limiting herself to only 800 calories a day. (Experts warn against eating less than 1,200 calories a day because it sends your body into starvation mode.) One day a week, she binged, allowing herself to eat whatever she wanted as a reward. One night after downing a hamburger, a chicken sandwich and some fries, she attempted to throw up her food for the first time. ""I was scared of having all those calories in my body,"" she remembered. ""I didn't know what to do to get rid of them."" But bulimia didn't ""suit"" her body, she said. ""I just wanted the act of eating."" iReporter shakes off 170 pounds . Over the summer, Monaco lost more than 30 pounds. She got tons of compliments from her classmates, who couldn't believe she'd dropped so much weight in such a short amount of time. She weighed her 127-pound body daily and wrote down everything she ate. She even brought her own salad dressing to the dining hall to make sure she knew exactly how many calories she was consuming. Monaco ran four miles a day, six days a week, and spent an additional hour at the gym doing weights. ""It became an obsession,"" she said. ""Did I do good today or bad today? It was always all or nothing."" It was an odd time in her life. In between salads, she remembers sneaking to the grocery store to buy cake and then eating it in the bathroom of her dorm so her friends wouldn't see. ""I cared very much how other people thought of me."" A tragic accident . On the morning of St. Patrick's Day 2009, Monaco got a call. Her roommate, who had spent the previous night in another room, was dead. ""It broke me,"" Monaco said, refusing to talk about what happened even now. For days, she couldn't eat. Then one afternoon she asked her boyfriend to pick up some Golden Oreos and a box of Toaster Strudels. The carbs comforted her. ""I thought, 'This helped. This feels good. I don't have to think right now about what happened,' "" she said. She started using food to cope with her pain and then blaming herself for using food to cope -- although it's unlikely she knew she was doing so at the time. She felt depressed and guilty, and food simply made her feel better. When her boyfriend of a year and half broke up with her shortly after her roommate's death, she went to the grocery store and bought bags of chips and several boxes of crackers. In the months that followed, she forgot all about the lean proteins and vegetables that used to make up her diet. 'I couldn't walk': Woman loses 276 pounds . Monaco's mom and dad were concerned about her but didn't realize food was becoming an issue, she says. Before her junior year, they moved her into a new apartment because she was nervous about sharing space with someone again. But living alone just enabled Monaco to binge without worrying about people looking over her shoulder. She started to ignore calls from friends and threw herself into her schoolwork. The day after she graduated college in May 2011, Monaco stepped on the scale for the first time in years. Her legs trembled when she saw the number: 240. She had gained more than 100 pounds in two years. She sat down at the kitchen table with her mom, and together they cried. A new balance . Until DSM-5 -- the latest version of the psychiatric diagnostic manual -- was released this month, binge eating wasn't an official eating disorder. Many who have it simply think they are gluttons who lack self-control, says Marsha Hudnall, a registered dietitian and co-owner of the Green Mountain at Fox Run weight loss retreat in Vermont. The disorder is characterized by frequent episodes of overeating in a short periods of time. People with the disorder feel out of control during binges and are often disgusted with themselves afterward. The usually eat alone because they're uncomfortable consuming so much in front of others. It's estimated that 3.5% of women and 2% of men in the United States have the disorder, but Hudnall says experts believe it's ""extremely underdiagnosed."" Doctors used treat the disorder by putting patients on a diet. They now know ""that is absolutely the wrong thing to do,"" Hudnall said. ""Many people who have binge-eating disorder, they're eating food to cope with their feelings. If you try to take away food without giving them something else to cope, you're stranding that person. And you make them feel guilty when they go back to the one strategy they know."" Monaco went to Green Mountain in the summer of 2011. She chose the retreat because it focused on helping women have a healthy relationship with food rather than focusing solely on losing weight. The first priority at the retreat, Hudnall says, is to get patients to eat regular, small meals that are based on the government's MyPlate guidelines. Many people who binge go long periods of time in between without eating to try to save calories, which can lead to more binge eating later on. The next step is therapy, where the patients learn other strategies for coping with their emotions. For Monaco, that meant writing. She purged her emotions into a journal and tried to forgive herself for using food to cope. She bonded with other women at the retreat who were all just ""trying to get to a happy place."" ""For the first time, I was not alone,"" she remembered. ""I was not sitting alone in my car or in room somewhere or in a bathroom stall, eating. ... This place really acknowledged that we're all real people with real problems."" Four weeks later, Monaco left with a better understanding of her disorder. She knew that she couldn't go back to the same environment that had led her to this pain, so she packed up and moved cross-country to live near her brother in California. Learning to eat again: Man drops 130 pounds after surgery . A happy place . Monaco hasn't had a binge in two years. Since leaving Green Mountain, she's lost 70 pounds. She lives with her new boyfriend and another roommate, a significant step in her recovery. She no longer feels the urge to eat mass quantities of pasta; food is fun now, though she still struggles with certain types. Pizza, for instance, scares her, since it was a binge eating trigger. ""It's kind of like seeing an ex-boyfriend and not being sure how to handle that situation,"" she explained. ""I get a whole slew of emotions that run through my body: I want to devour you. I need to stay away from you. I want you in my life."" She keeps healthy snacks like baby carrots and cottage cheese on hand but allows herself gummy bears when she wants them. She's back at the gym but has made it into an activity she does with her boyfriend rather than an obsession. Monaco is also writing for Green Mountain's blog, FitWoman.com, in hopes of reaching out to other women who are struggling. ""My goal is to just feel better,"" she said. ""I'm hoping that with this story and with my blog ... I'm hoping that what I've gone through is really going to make a difference in somebody else's life."" Have you lost weight?

"(CNN) -- Residents of Galveston Island, Texas, who were evacuated before Hurricane Ike strafed the Texas Gulf coast can return to their homes Wednesday, but they will find few comforts, Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas said Saturday. Workers remove debris from Luigi's Italian restaurant in the Strand District of Galveston, Texas, on Friday. Galveston has little or no electricity, natural gas, water or sewer services. There are no medical facilities, there is limited cell phone coverage, and a curfew is in place from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Violators risk a $2,000 fine, the mayor said in a statement. Galveston took a direct hit from Ike when it barreled ashore September 13 as a Category 2 storm. Despite orders to evacuate, about 20,000 of Galveston's 60,000 residents opted to remain in their homes. Many of those who left went to shelters. Thomas said residents can begin returning at 6 a.m. (7 a.m. ET) Wednesday. Residents and business owners must show photo identification verifying their address to guards manning checkpoints, she said. ""Very limited water, sewer, natural gas, and electric services have been restored to areas behind the seawall,"" the mayor said in a statement. Residents of the heavily damaged west end of the island can assess their damages but must leave the area by 6 p.m., Thomas said. ""Water, sewer, natural gas, and electric services have not been restored to areas west of seawall. Therefore, sanitary living conditions are not available at this time,"" she said. Thomas gave a long list of supplies residents should take with them when they return.","But mayor warns that there are few comforts to be had on island .

"(CNN) -- Hey, young readers: Instead of another summer uttering the dreaded phrase ""I'm bored,"" how about meeting a NASA astronaut or building a working potato cannon? Maker Camp, which kicks off its second year on July 8, is different kind of summer camp for kids and teens. Instead of canoes and kickball, it has microcontrollers and robots. There are no bus rides or cabins; camp can take place anywhere there's a computer and an Internet connection. The camp is a free, six-week online program inspired by the maker movement -- the trend toward do-it-yourself culture -- and run by Maker Media in collaboration with Google. Maker Media also publishes Make magazine and organizes the Maker Faires. The virtual camp guides kids through daily DIY projects and connects campers to each other using the Google+ social network. Each week has a different theme, and kids are encouraged to share their creations and ask questions during daily video broadcasts. The lifeblood of the camp are daily Google+ Hangouts where makers, counselors and other special guests lead young viewers through a project. The day's project and supply list is posted in the morning and the hangouts start at 11 a.m. PT (2 p.m. ET). Participants must be at least 13 to have a Google+ profile, but many parents of younger kids use their own log-ins and do the projects together. They can also be viewed on YouTube. ""It is like a camp. You go there, you choose an arts and crafts project or you choose archery and meet other people interested in the same things,"" said Maker Media founder and CEO Dale Dougherty. This year, the camp will kick off with a live broadcast from the new Exploratorium science museum in San Francisco, where kids will learn how to build a motorboat made from a soda bottle. All the most popular projects from last year will be back, including robotic birds, intro to computer science and mold making. The first week is all about motion, but there are also weeks dedicated to music, games and special effects, such as usingg make-up and arduino pieces (open-source electronics) to turn yourself into a cyborg. Other projects might tackle the growing field of 3-D printing, which employs computer models to replicate three-dimensional plastic objects. On Fridays, the camp will broadcast from other locations for ""field trips."" Planned destinations this summer include the NASA Ames campus and a trip to see the Oracle Team USA's America's Cup racing yachts. Hands-on education . The idea for Maker Camp originated with Google. Last spring, the company approached Dougherty with a detailed plan for a virtual camp where kids could participate in DIY projects from anywhere with an Internet connection. Google was looking for a project that would show-off the Google+ platform, specifically Google Hangouts. Google is so involved with the camp that it has its name on all the Maker Camp branding, an unusual step for the company. Aside from the promotional opportunities, both companies hope the free camp can encourage more kids to get into building, tinkering, hacking and crafting. From there, it could spread into schools. ""This will infect education,"" said Maker Media editorial director Ken Denmead. ""There is a desperate desire and need for this stuff. People want this kind of creativity and building in education."" Maker Media is helping drive the burgeoning maker movement, and many educators are jumping on board. They see these hands-on projects as a way to get kids excited about science and technology, which is increasingly important as the U.S. works to produce more science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) professionals. ""It is a gateway to STEM, but we're not sitting there saying 'here's the velocity of a rocket,' "" said Dougherty. ""By having these experiences, they don't have in school, it encourages them to learn more about it."" Connecting kids over the Internet who are passionate about tinkering and science lets them know that they are not alone. But that doesn't mean campers don't get lonely. This year organizers are branching out into real-world meet-ups by bringing kids together in their communities to form their own minicamp cells. Last year, some librarians took it upon themselves to integrate the projects into their regular summer programming. This year, Maker Camp is doing an official affiliate program, working with 100 partners around the country. Each official partner gets a Maker Camp starter box filled with starter supplies, lesson materials and a guide. Organizers aren't sending out 3-D printers, but a surprising number of libraries already have their own 3-D printers up and running. Carla Avitabile, the teen librarian at the Marin Country Free Library just north of San Francisco, is doing her second year of Maker Camp. She says the projects can teach basic skills that adults take for granted. While building pistons for a Diet Coke-and-Mentos project, she found some kids didn't know how to use a screwdriver. Live from camp . Most of the sessions will be broadcast live on Google+ from the Maker Media headquarters in Sebastapol, California. There is no TV crew or elaborate video set up for the broadcasts. The camp organizers say their target audience doesn't respond well to overproduced content, so they keep it simple and scrappy. A prefab studio has been set up on a grassy lawn behind the offices, a few steps away from the local community garden. Some days the camp will broadcast live from the Maker Media lab, a minimaker heaven filled with every tool imaginable, including 3-D printers and CNC manufacturing machines. The lab is staffed by paid interns and employees, led by Maker lab supervisor Sam Freeman, who looks the part of a young mad scientist in his white lab coat. The crew builds and tests projects for the magazine, such as a hexacopter, a homemade Segway and a mini-Tesla coil. A handful of librarians and former and future campers got a tour of the Maker Lab and studio and checked out one of last year's potato cannons, which were actually used to shoot ping pong balls for safety reasons. ""We won't be doing that at the library, but awesome,"" said librarian Lori Easterwood, who will be integrating Maker Camp into her summer program at the Sacramento Public Library. Camper Zack, 13, is going to take part in the program for a second summer. Inspired by last year, he's been working on a remote-operated vehicle that goes underwater and has a mounted camera. He hopes to finish it in time for his family's summer vacation so he can drop it into Clear Lake in north-central California. ""I want to see if there are any catfish down there,"" he said. Wherever the campers are tuning in from, participation is key. ""This is definitely not computer camp. We don't want kids sitting in front of their computer,"" said Michelle Hlubinka, the Maker Camp education lead. ""I'm always so sad about the kids spending their summer looking at a screen. We want them to go outside!""","The Maker Camp kicks off its online summer camp for teens on July 8 .
The camp is conducted over Google Hangouts and focuses on DIY projects .

"Paris (CNN) -- It can sometimes take a lot to stir passions in France, but a shocking Facebook page and the stream of insults that followed have roused the French to a heated public debate about racism. The Facebook page belonged to a local candidate from the far-right National Front political party, and compared justice minister Christiane Taubira, who is black, to a monkey. The candidate was suspended but there were more, similar insults that followed -- including on the front page of a right-wing newspaper which featured the headline ""Clever as a monkey"" alongside a photo of Taubira. The attacks on such a high-profile figure eventually led lawmakers across the political divide to rise up in support of Taubira -- but they have also led to a great deal of soul-searching over the extent of racism in France. Those who study the question, like historian Pap N'Diaye, whose father was from Senegal, says there is no question racism is growing. ""Racist attacks are on the rise in France,"" says N'Diaye.""And racist slurs that used to be absolutely uncommon are becoming more and more common, if not more accepted, in growing parts of French society. So there is a lot to worry about when looking at the situation."" In a country that takes pride and expends considerable energy to ensure that the principle of ""egalite"" (equality) is strictly adhered to, there are some racial references practically embedded in the language and culture here. ""Negre"" is the N-word in France, and it is used in ways that would raise eyebrows elsewhere. A ""negre,"" for example, is a ghostwriter in French, ""tete de negre"" is the name for a chocolate pastry, and ""petit negre"" is the way one refers to poor or pidgin French. Opinion: Is France racist? Abuse shocks nation . But the recent rise of intolerance goes far beyond throwbacks to France's colonial past. At Netino, a private company that moderates and deletes racial and other objectionable postings on internet forums, websites and social pages, CEO Jeremie Mani has watched a steadily growing hardening of language. Part of it, he believes, relates to the increasing license people feel to express on the web sentiments they might hold privately but would never bring up in direct conversation. But he also thinks part of it is due to growing racism among his countrymen: When the Taubira affair came along, Mani says he saw a 10% spike in the number of racial slurs his company had to delete. Many here link more hostile attitudes toward immigration with the racism issue. But the far right National Front party is trying to separate the two. National Front Vice President Florian Philippot, who denies that his party is racist, says: ""Racism is not growing in France."" But in nearly the same breath he states flatly what analysts believe is the party's major selling point: ""We need to end immigration."" The National Front's anti-immigration platform has at least partly contributed to its growing popularity. The party was practically banished from political discourse at one point, but according to one recent poll, 42% of those questioned said they would consider voting for a National Front candidate in the coming municipal elections. That news comes at the same time as the attacks on the justice minister -- and other recent incidents where racial slurs were hurled in public (on France's football field, for example) -- have been enough to mobilize mainstream leaders and cultural figures here. There have been several rallies against racism and more are planned. Whether anti-racism demonstrations will be enough to change attitudes in France in the short term is another matter. Many like Pap N'Diaye believe a significant factor in the growing racism is the poor economy, as people try to find scapegoats responsible for the hard times. Until the economy improves, it seems doubtful that even widespread public chest-beating over the issue will have much effect. Opinion: Is France racist?

"(CNN) -- Bimini is a tiny land of simple pleasures. Ernest Hemingway lived on the small island chain in the Bahamas from 1935-1937 and famously drank vodka martinis, extra dry with olives, inside the Compleat Angler Hotel, which burned down in 2006. ""Swim, eat, drink, work, read, talk, read, fish, fish, swim, drink, sleep."" That's Bimini, summed up by a character in Hemingway's novel ""Islands in the Stream."" Walking along a quiet stretch of white-sand beach, I've come to appreciate this remote retreat of old-school fishermen, miles of mangroves and spectacular ocean views. The first group of islands in the Bahamas chain, Bimini -- with the small islands of North Bimini and South Bimini at its core -- is only about 50 miles from Miami, but the slow-and-easy lifestyle on the historic atoll feels like a world away. Adam Clayton Powell, the late congressman from New York who embraced a self-imposed exile on Bimini in 1967, was known for sipping scotch and milk inside The End of the World Bar and referring to Bimini as a ""shaggy paradise."" For me, Bimini has always been a tranquil place to escape the commotion of big-city living, a sandy haven where I can sit and listen to the ocean waves gently slapping the shoreline. ""When you look at the ocean in Bimini you can often see a dozen different shades of blue and green,"" said Capt. Ansil Saunders, an 80-year-old world-renown fisherman, boat builder and local legend. North Bimini is only seven miles long and less than a mile wide, so walking and biking along the main road -- ""The King's Highway"" -- is the best way to experience Bimini. With 1,600 residents in Bimini, there are no crowds or long lines and rush-hour traffic is often just a three-golf-cart pile-up in a hotel parking lot. Take a leisurely stroll through Alice Town, Bimini's main settlement that dates back to 1848, and you'll find a cozy collection of small shops, family-owned restaurants and bars, one bank and plenty of engaging conversation. What you won't find in Alice Town are traffic lights. ""People come to Bimini because it's a laid-back destination,"" Anthony Stuart, general manager of the Bimini Tourist Office, said in a recent interview. ""They walk the street, sit on the side of the road, meet local people, listen to music and experience good food -- and that includes fresh-baked Bimini bread."" And, Stuart added proudly, ""Bimini is safe."" I've traveled to Bimini many times over the years and even though swimming, eating, reading, talking and drinking consumed most of my days, exploring Bimini's enchanting underwater world was also at the top of my to-do list. Fifty feet beneath the sea, Bimini offers an array of shipwrecks, shark dives, swim-through caverns and tunnels and colorful coral heads resting on the ocean floor. Divers also come to Bimini to explore the fascinating limestone formations that some believe to be the Lost Continent of Atlantis. (Nondivers can also experience Bimini's reefs through daily snorkeling trips. Snorkeling is a fun and easy way to spot angel fish, moray eels, sea turtles and many other forms of exotic marine life. ) ""The scuba diving here is great,"" Saunders said. ""The reefs are very beautiful and many people come here to dive with dolphins."" Tourists who venture near the docks may run into Saunders, Bimini's most well-known resident. Saunders served as a personal guide to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1964, when King wrote his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech on Bimini. King also returned to Bimini in 1968 to write the last speech he delivered, to the sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, before his death. Forty-eight years ago, King wrote part of his eulogy in Saunders' wooden boat deep in the Bimini mangroves, a winding swamp of thick bushes and trees where 100 species of fish and marine life fill the murky waters. ""There was such humility about Dr. King,"" Saunders recalled. ""He enjoyed communing with nature in the mangroves. Birds were singing. Stingrays were swimming by. He was inspired. When he first stepped foot on this soil, I could tell there was something special about Dr. King and Bimini."" Bimini is known as the big-game fishing capital of the world. Anglers have been traveling to Bimini for decades to snare bonefish, snapper, tuna and wahoo. The island has become famous for its international fishing competitions and Bahamian guides, like Saunders, are skilled tradesmen. Even though Bimini is still a sleepy little island, change is coming fast. A new casino is almost completed and expected to open sometime in 2013. The casino coincides with a ""fast ferry"" between South Florida and Bimini that will offer tourists an alternative to flying. There is only one airport serving Bimini -- South Bimini Airport (BIM). Daily scheduled air service is available to Bimini from Nassau, Grand Bahama Island and Florida. Where to stay . I like the Bimini Big Game Club and the Bimini Bay Resort. Founded in 1947, the Big Game Club is situated just off the main road in Alice Town. With 51 rooms and quaint cottages, the hotel also offers a 75-slip marina for tourists who arrive by boat. It's a comfortable, clean and friendly facility within walking distance of Alice Town's restaurants and bars. The Bimini Bay Resort is a new luxurious property that features 374 Caribbean-style hotel rooms with authentic Bahamian dÃ©cor. The resort features several upscale and inexpensive restaurants and a popular infinity pool that overlooks the ocean. Bimini Bay Resort is not as close to Alice Town as the Big Game Club, but it's only a short ride by taxi, golf cart or bike to town. Where to eat . The Anchorage Restaurant & Bar in Alice Town is a staple in Bimini that overlooks the sea. It's a small, inexpensive family-owned restaurant serving genuine Bahamian food. Try the conch fritters and conch salad. The Bimini Big Game Bar and Grill serves good burgers, fresh fish sandwiches, pizza and steak. At the Bimini Bay Resort, Sabor is the resort's most upscale restaurant, and Bimini's most fashionable eatery. Try the conch ceviche and fish tacos. If you're looking for nightlife and club-hopping, stick with Nassau, but if it's serenity near the ocean that sounds appealing, then you might want to consider Bimini -- a stress-free destination for stressed-out travelers. As one Bimini native once told me: ""No rushing, no pressure, no heart attacks."" Michael H. Cottman writes about national politics for BlackAmericaWeb.com. He is an avid scuba diver and the author of ""The Wreck of the Henrietta Marie,"" the story of a British slave ship that sank off the coast of Key West, Florida, in 1700 and Cottman's personal journey retracing its route and scuba diving inlets where the ship anchored.","Bimini is only about 50 miles from Miami .

"(CNN) -- The college student accused of hijacking the webcam of Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf and other young women is a former high school classmate of the pageant winner. Jared James Abrahams, 19, was arrested Thursday for allegedly taking nude images of the women using their own webcams, and then blackmailing them to send more explicit material. 2011: Hacker gets 6 years in prison for 'sextortion' scheme . Wolf told CNN on Friday that she had no personal connection with Abrahams while they were in high school in Temecula, California. ""When I heard his name it didn't click right away what he looked like,"" she said. ""His name is familiar. When I looked at his yearbook picture, I recalled moments when I saw him in the hallways."" The suspect is accused of taking nude pictures of Wolf while she changed clothes or walked into her room after a shower. Wolf, 19, said her computer apparently was hacked months before receiving the first threatening e-mail on March 21. At the time, she did not have her current pageant crown and was attending a college in Costa Mesa and lived in an apartment. ""When I got the first e-mail, I read the first three lines and I quickly scrolled through it and saw it was a long e-mail,"" she said. ""Two photos of me were attached. I literally threw my phone across the room and started screaming. It did not feel real, it was like a horror movie."" Wolf said she believes the images were taken while she was in high school. A threat to Wolf allegedly read, ""Either you do one of the things listed below or I upload these pics and a lot more (I have a LOT more and those are better quality) on all your accounts for everybody to see and your dream of being a model will be transformed into a pornstar"" (sic). Fears about such hacking are not misplaced. Last month, it was reported that some high-end televisions with built-in cameras could be turned on without the viewers knowing. Security cameras, lights, heating control systems and even door locks and windows are now increasingly coming with features that allow users to control them remotely. Without proper security controls, there's little to stop hackers from invading users' privacy, stealing personal information or spying on people. FTC cracks down on hacked video camera maker . Abrahams is a computer science student. His arrest came six months after Wolf alerted authorities to the ""sextortion"" scheme. Authorities executed a search warrant at Abrahams' home on June 4, at which time he ""voluntarily agreed to speak"" with a pair of FBI agents. Describing himself in that interview as a college freshman who was good with computers, a criminal complaint said, he admitted using malware and his expertise to ""watch his victims change their clothes and ... use the photographs against them."" When he admitted what he'd done, Abrahams said he had 30 to 40 ""slave computers"" -- or other people's electronic devices he controlled -- and has had as many as 150 total, according to the complaint. Investigators also linked him to at least eight other young women, some of them, like Wolf, from Southern California. Others were from as far away as Moldova. Rutgers Freshman's Suicide Shows Risks of Webcams . Wolf said she became aware of the hack after she got a Facebook alert that someone had tried to change her password. She then noticed other social media accounts were not ""acting the same."" The pageant contestant, now attending school in New York, replied to a couple of e-mails that day in March. ""I asked him, 'Please don't do this to me.'"" Authorities advised her not to have further contact. The FBI used evidence from her computer and iPhone to build its case, Wolf said. ""It took them two to three months to figure out who this was."" Wolf told CNN said has been on a ""roller coaster of emotions."" ""It's kind of hard to explain my emotions about him. One one hand I am upset. ... how he traumatized me,"" she said. ""I feel, on the other hand, sorry for him. He went to high school with me."" Wolf says she is now on a campaign to raise awareness about the risks that technology can expose users to. She has spoken to students about steps they can take. ""It can happen to them because they are growing up in a generation where technology is so advanced."" ""Be careful what you are doing on your computer,"" she advised. ""There are cameras on computers and iPhones. Be careful of what you are doing in front of your camera."" Wolf said she used her computer responsibly but ""did not know how dangerous a computer can be in the hands of someone else."" Other advice? Change passwords on e-mail and social media accounts. Make them difficult. Delete cookies and browsing history. And, when not communicating with a loved one or friend, put a sticker over the computer webcam.

"(CNN) -- A judge on Wednesday set bail at $100,000 for a man accused of carrying a fake bomb near a Boston crowd that was marking the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings. The judge also ordered the suspect, Kevin Edson, also known as Kayvon Edson, to be seen at a state hospital that evaluates defendants' sanity after a mental health professional told the judge that Edson has a history of psychiatric disturbances. Police said they arrested Edson, 25, on Tuesday evening after he was found carrying a backpack containing a rice cooker near the Boston Marathon finish line on Boylston Street, where survivors of the 2013 bombing were to complete a marathon-length walk marking the attack's anniversary. In the 2013 attack, two pressure-cooker bombs exploded, killing three people and wounding at least 264 others. A barefoot Edson, carrying a backpack and wearing black clothes with a veil and hat covering his face, screamed and yelled during Wednesday's event on Boylston Street, drawing officers' attention, police said. Officers found a rice cooker in the backpack, and Edson told them it was nonexplosive, Assistant District Attorney Susan Terrey told Judge Michael Coyne on Wednesday. Authorities evacuated the area, and a bomb squad detonated the rice cooker as a precaution. Specialists determined the object had not been a bomb, police said. According to Terrey, Edson told police: ""I knew what I was doing. It was being conceived in my head. It's symbolism. Come on. The performance got the best of me."" Terrey asked for the $100,000 bail, arguing that Edson had shown a willingness to put his interests ahead of society's. Edson had been hospitalized multiple times for psychiatric problems and had been off his medications for three to four months, a mental health professional told Coyne, without elaborating about the disturbances. Defense attorney Shannon Lopez argued for a bail of $5,000, telling the judge that Edson needed ""some assistance to stabilize himself mentally"" but arguing that he wasn't a danger to the public, has never been convicted of a crime and never made a bomb threat. Edson was charged with disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, disturbing a public assembly, possession or use of a hoax device, and making a false bomb threat. The latter charge carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison upon conviction, the Suffolk County district attorney's office said. He has pleaded not guilty, CNN affiliate WHDH reported. ""If this was a performance, it was the most irresponsible, senseless, and selfish performance I can imagine,"" Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said in a news release. ""It was also criminal. It was akin to shouting 'fire' in a theater. People were put in fear, public transportation was disrupted, and a day of somber remembrance and reflection was marred by this defendant's choices. ""There could not have been a worse time or place for this inexcusable behavior."" How can you keep 26.2 miles safe?

"(CNN) -- ""My hands are tied."" Those are words that Howard Dean Bailey never wants to hear again. The last time he heard them: an immigration judge was ordering him out of the country. In June 2012, just days shy of his 41st birthday, the Navy veteran was deported to Jamaica, a country he hadn't lived in since he was 17. ""It's kind of stressful,"" Bailey said in a phone interview, but then corrected himself. ""Not kind of -- very stressful."" Bailey is one of more than 23,000 permanent legal residents who were deported in 2012. The number of veterans is unknown because the Department of Homeland Security says it doesn't keep those records and neither do other government agencies. But the club is not an exclusive one. For instance, the group Banished Veterans, founded by a deported vet Hector Barajas, is in touch with veterans in 19 countries. He said he knows of six living in Jamaica from the Vietnam War, the Gulf War and the Iraq War. And he estimates that as many as 30,000 former service members have been deported since 1996, while other groups put the total at several thousand. Although thousands of former service members and their families are believed to be impacted, the matter is virtually invisible even with immigration reform a hot-button issue in Washington and veterans concerns at large receiving attention as the nation steps away from 13 years of war. As President Barack Obama reviews related policies following heavy criticism for deporting more immigrants than any previous administration, immigration groups ask that greater discretion be given for those in the country legally -- and that military service be a priority, especially with tens of thousands of men and women leaving the post-war military and transitioning back into civilian life. Obama said he can't stop deportations, but maybe he can . Served in Gulf War . And that brings us back to the first time Bailey heard the words, ""My hands are tied."" After graduating from high school in New York, Bailey did a four-year stint as a communications specialist in the Navy, serving in the first Gulf War and traveling around the world -- to Egypt, Italy, Israel and Spain. He was one of thousands serving in the early 1990s who weren't U.S. citizens. Currently 30,000 non-citizens serve in the military, a small fraction of the total number of active duty forces. After being honorably discharged, Bailey ran into trouble. As he tells it, an acquaintance from the military asked him if he could mail a package to Bailey's Virginia Beach house. When the package arrived, Bailey offered to meet his friend to hand it over. Before he got more than a mile, police surrounded his car, confiscated the box and told him it was filled with marijuana and that they had been tracking it. Bailey said he had no idea of the package's contents. He never thought to ask what was being delivered. And he never saw his acquaintance again. ""I didn't want to call my mother,"" Bailey said, recalling the incident and insisting that he'd never been in trouble with the law. ""I'm not doing drugs; there's no way I can go to jail."" Jail time . Two years later, in 1997, he was given a court date. His lawyer advised him to plead guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute to avoid risk of losing his trial and receiving a harsher sentence. Despite having an otherwise spotless record, the sentencing judge told him that his guilty plea meant he had to sentence him to 10 years in prison under mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines. ""My hands are tied,"" Bailey said the judge told him. Bailey's advocates and the Homeland Security Department confirmed the main details of his case. He ended up serving a hair more than 15 months, but little did he know at the time that his sentence was long enough to trigger more problems down the road. After prison, he moved home to be with his wife and 1-year-old daughter. He started his own trucking company, bought a house, stayed out of trouble and thought things were going well. So in 2005, he decided to upgrade his legal status and apply for citizenship. He told the immigration case worker that he had been charged with a felony. She said she would be back in touch. Five years later, they said they couldn't find any record of his felony, so he provided them with the court disposition. In early 2010, he was told the felony barred him from obtaining his citizenship. ""I was very disappointed,"" Bailey said. Should Obama use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform? Then it got worse. Five months later, in June 2010, immigration enforcement officials showed up at his home, telling him that he was being detained because of his felony. ""If I never applied for citizenship it would have been OK,"" Bailey said. Law made it easier . In 1996, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act, a law that made it easier to deport people who were in the country legally. Legal permanent residents, like Bailey, can be deported if they commit a class of crimes only applicable to immigrants called ""aggravated felonies"" or ""crimes of moral turpitude."" They are crimes that include murder and weapons trafficking but also drug possession and theft -- any crime that constitutes a sentence of one year or more. Rick Weidman, executive director for policy and government affairs for Vietnam Veterans of America said veterans facing deportation contact his organization for help. He said he draws a line at helping violent criminals but ""to deport an individual after they put their lives on the line, 98 percent of the American people have not done that."" While the Obama administration has deported more illegal immigrants than its predecessors, it began deporting fewer legal immigrants in 2010, reaching a 10-year low in 2013 of 20,153 legal resident deportees, according to homeland security data. Nicole Navas, a spokeswoman with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said she couldn't ""speculate"" on the reason why the deportation of legal residents have decreased. More discretion . David Martin, former deputy general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security in 2009 and 2010, suggested that immigration agents were given more discretion on which people to take into deportation proceedings. He pointed to a 2011 memo by Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton that outlined what considerations to make when determining what legal residents to take into detention, including military service, community ties, family members who are citizens and cooperation with immigration enforcement -- all things that Bailey had going for him. ""ICE respects the service and sacrifice of those in military service, and is very deliberate in its review of cases involving veterans,"" Navas said. ""ICE exercises prosecutorial discretion for members of the armed forces who have honorably served our country on a case-by-case basis when appropriate."" But the policy change came too late for Bailey. He had already been in custody for a year and while immigration agents now have some discretion, immigration judges still have none and cannot take any of a person's positive attributes into consideration before ordering deportation for people who have committed ""aggravated felonies"" -- no matter how long ago the crime was committed. More susceptible . Michael Wishnie, a Yale University law professor who represents veterans going through deportation proceedings, said veterans, especially those returning from war, can be even more susceptible to deportable offenses. ""Anecdotal evidence leads me to suspect that veterans have been deported more frequently and for less serious offenses,"" Wishnie said, hearing about the first veteran sent through deportation proceedings in 1998. As the two-year anniversary of his deportation approaches, Bailey's sister said his deportation date is etched into her memory. ""June 1st. I will never forget it,"" Janice Thomas said. ""It's the same day I was coming back from my honeymoon in the Dominican Republic."" Bailey said he can't find work or even leave his house very often due to the societal stigma in Jamaica of being a deportee. He said his family in the United States has broken apart. His teen age son has gotten into trouble with the law and his teen age daughter is severely depressed. ""Sometimes it's hard for me to talk to (my daughter) because all I want to do is cry,"" he said. ""Everything just went downhill since I left them."" Still trying . His sister and mother are working to bring Bailey back home. They have met with members of the Obama administration and with lawmakers, including Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who is interested in his case. Alisa Wellek with the Immigrant Defense Project, who is currently representing Bailey, said Obama should address the issue of tens of thousands of legal permanent residents being deported each year. ""The Obama administration has the power to exercise discretion and provide deportation relief in cases like Howard's, and should do so without any further delay,"" she said. ""This is worse than death in some ways,"" Bailey said. ""It's like being buried alive."" Rand Paul: GOP needs to 'get beyond deportation'","Navy veteran Howard Dean Bailey was deported in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- The real Stephen Colbert is probably someone ""Stephen Colbert,"" the character, would find easy to mock. The real Colbert is reportedly just a regular guy who lives in a New Jersey suburb with his wife and three kids, has taught Sunday school and says earnest things like ""I really admire newsmen"" when explaining that he doesn't confuse his Colbert character with an actual journalist. Fans have readily embraced the blustering buffoonery of the conservative character Colbert, who arrives on the ""Colbert Report"" set to calls of ""Stephen! Stephen!"" It remains to be seen if they will have equal affection for the man Colbert who will replace David Letterman as host of ""The Late Show"" in 2015. Even Colbert the character is aware of how tough that just might be. ""I gotta tell you, I do not envy whoever they try to put in that chair,"" he said with a wink on his Thursday night show as the audience cheered. ""Those are some huge shoes to fill."" If anyone is used to challenges, it's Stephen Colbert. Raised in Charleston, South Carolina, the youngest of 11 children, he was just 10 years old when his father and two of his brothers were killed in a plane crash in 1974. Eastern Airlines Flight 212 crashed in a cornfield near Charlotte, North Carolina, and 72 people were killed. Colbert told Oprah Winfrey it took him years to grieve their deaths. ""I didn't really really feel the loss until I was in college,"" he said "" Then, oh, I was in bad shape. "" He told the New York Times Magazine in 2012 that he credits his mother with helping him survive the tragedy. ""She taught me to be grateful for my life regardless of what that entailed, and that's directly related to the image of Christ on the cross and the example of sacrifice that he gave us,"" said Colbert, a devout Catholic. ""What she taught me is that the deliverance God offers you from pain is not no pain -- it's that the pain is actually a gift. What's the option? God doesn't really give you another choice."" Colbert says it was his mother who encouraged him to enter Northwestern's theater program, which led him into improv and a gig with Chicago's famous Second City troupe. It was there he struck up friendships with Steve Carell and Amy Sedaris. Colbert eventually landed in New York City where he briefly worked with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" as they needed someone who ""looked straight, but could act funny,"" he told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" in 2007. ""They really just wanted me to quip,"" he said. ""I did one piece for them."" ""GMA"" shot down several other story ideas he pitched, Colbert said, but his credentials from them came in handy when ""The Daily Show"" came calling in 1997 looking for correspondents. Colbert had written a little for ""Saturday Night Live"" and his combination of comedy chops and the brief experience working with ""GMA"" made him ""genetically engineered"" to work with the show, he said he was told. Thus, the character of ""Stephen Colbert"" was introduced to the world. One person who could do without his alter ego is his wife, Evelyn ""Evie"" McGee-Colbert, whom he married in 1993. She told Oprah Winfrey that other Colbert is not welcomed in their home. ""I don't really like the other guy,"" she said. ""He doesn't come in this house."" Her husband is smart, funny and incredibly romantic, McGee-Colbert said. He is also intensely private, though he works hard to connect with his audiences and fans, he told Rolling Stone Magazine. ""I was 22 or 23 when I made a decision not to be actively Hamlet-like and miserable in my daily life, and the decision helped a lot,"" he said. ""Living vitally is not easier than living morbidly -- it's just better. People are all we've got."" Colbert will have to rely on such fans to make his new venture a success. Merissa Marr of the Wall Street Journal wonders at his crossover appeal once Colbert the character has been vanquished. ""Whether Mr. Colbert can maintain his following as a different persona, no longer cloaked in parody, isn't guaranteed,"" she writes, noting that ""CBS is arguably the most middle of the road of the broadcast networks."" Colbert's old boss has no worries. On ""The Daily Show,"" Jon Stewart said, ""The exciting news is that I no longer need a cable subscription for the privilege of watching Stephen Colbert."" ""I think Stephen Colbert is up for the challenge,"" Stewart said. ""So while we wish Dave the absolute best for a well-earned retirement, there's no greater joy for seeing a genuinely good man, who works as hard as he can every day and deserves all the success in the world, actually get that success. For Stephen we're just thrilled.""","Colbert will not be in character on ""The Late Show""

"Washington (CNN) -- Power it up, or leave it behind. The Transportation Security Administration said Sunday that security screeners at overseas airports may ask U.S.-bound passengers to turn on their electronic devices to prove they work and aren't explosive devices. They won't allow devices without power on board planes. The traveler may then undergo additional screening. It's part of an update to security measures aimed at combating potential new threats from terrorists in the Middle East and Europe. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson directed the TSA last week to enhance security at overseas airports that have direct flights to the United States. The specifics of the enhanced measures weren't originally released, and it isn't known what other measures the TSA may employ. The TSA also would have to coordinate with the foreign governments which provide security at airports in their countries, along with the airlines and private security companies. ""Our job is to ... try to anticipate the next attack, not simply react to the last one. And so we continually evaluate the world situation, and we know that there remains a terrorist threat to the United States, and aviation security is a large part of that,"" Johnson told NBC's ""Meet The Press."" ""This is not something to overreact to or over-speculate about,"" he said. A homeland security official said last week that the changes would primarily focus on airports in Europe and the Middle East. The effort does not involve changes to what travelers can take aboard flights. But passengers may see additional inspections of shoes and electronics, additional use of scanners designed to detect trace amounts of explosives, and another stage of screening at boarding gates, in some cases, the official said. The changes came about based on new intelligence on terror groups trying to build new types of improvised explosives that are harder to detect, the official told CNN. While there was no specific threat prompting the enhancements, U.S. officials are concerned about the possibility that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula might develop bombs which could pass through current security measures undetected. Since hardening cockpit doors and taking other measures after the 9/11 al Qaeda attacks, the U.S. aviation security focus has shifted primarily from hijackings to plastic and other explosives that can be carried aboard a plane or hidden in baggage. The UK Department for Transport confirmed Wednesday that it is stepping up some of its aviation security measures. ""For obvious reasons we will not be commenting in detail on those changes. The majority of passengers should not experience significant disruption,"" a spokesman said. ""The UK has some of the most robust aviation security measures, and we will continue to take all the steps necessary to ensure that public safety is maintained."" The updated security measures only apply to airports overseas, and Johnson said he doesn't think the enhancements will make their way to domestic airports at this time. ""I believe that we've taken the appropriate measures to deal with the existing situation and not unnecessarily burden the traveling public,"" Johnson told NBC.

"Washington (CNN) -- The state-led push to legalize pot is a ""chronic"" problem for the Obama administration. Marijuana is not only legal in Colorado and Washington, but cannabis has become a cottage industry complete with 420 sampler tours and shops where customers can buy pot brownies or candy in those two states. And New York and Florida could soon join the 20 states and the District of Columbia where medical marijuana is legal, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The administration has taken a fuzzy stance on the matter: in states where it's legal to puff, the government will pass on punishment. ""We're going to see what happens in the experiments in Colorado and Washington,"" President Barack Obama said in a recent interview with CNN's Jake Tapper. ""The Department of Justice ... has said that we are going to continue to enforce federal laws. But in those states, we recognize that ... the federal government doesn't have the resources to police whether somebody is smoking a joint on a corner."" That approach frustrates some in state and federal law enforcement â€” including the head of the Drug Enforcement Agency, Michele Leonhart, who according to several media reports, blasted the administration's approach during an annual sheriffs meeting last month. Jon Gettman, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Shenandoah University, said it is ""politically convenient"" for the administration to allow the states to tackle pot policy rather than change the federal approach. ""They see social change happening and they're caught between a rock and a hard place,"" Gettman said. That social change includes a sea change in the way Americans view pot use. A CNN/ORC International poll last month showed that just over half the country â€” 55% â€”supports marijuana legalization. This is up from the 16% who felt that way a quarter century ago. Nearly three-quarters of those polled say alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana. Where pot is legal . It's a sentiment the president shares. ""As has been well documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life,"" the President told the New Yorker in a recent interview. ""I don't think it is more dangerous than alcohol."" Shortly after the interview was published, the administration rushed to clarify the President's position. It said the White House opposes a national move to decriminalize pot despite Obama's personal views on marijuana use. Marijuana is currently classified under the Controlled Substances Act as ""Schedule I,"" much like heroin or cocaine, with a high likelihood for abuse and no medical value. ""What is and isn't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress,"" Obama told Tapper during the CNN interview. However, the President did not say during the interview whether he would urge Congress to move to reclassify marijuana. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, has been working to gather lawmaker signatures on a letter to Obama in support of reclassifying marijuana. The administration has previously indicated that it is unlikely to reclassify marijuana under a less stringent category of drugs. Frustration with what some lawmakers see as the administration's mixed messaging on marijuana was evident during a House Government Operations Subcommittee hearing on Tuesday. When Michael Botticelli, deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, hedged on answering whether cocaine, methamphetamine or marijuana is more dangerous and addictive Blumenauer pounced. ""If a professional like you cannot answer clearly that meth is more dangerous than marijuana which every kid on the street knows, which every parent knows -- if you can't answer that maybe that's why you are failing to educate people about the dangers,"" he said. ""I don't want kids smoking marijuana. ... But if the deputy director of the office of drug policy can't answer that question how do you expect high school kids to take you seriously?"" Feds working on new pot banking rules . The administration has ""a bad political problem"" when it comes to pot, said Kevin Sabet, an assistant professor at the University of Florida's Drug Policy Institute. ""I think this is a very difficult position for them and they see it as a lose-lose,"" said Sabet, who served as a drug policy adviser to both Republican and Democratic administrations and is on the board of directors of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, an anti-pot legalization group. ""They don't want to alienate a voting bloc in favor of legalization."" Obama's views so incensed the DEA director that Leonhart blew off a little steam about the topic during the annual meeting of the country's sheriffs late last month, according to the Boston Herald. Sheriffs who were present told the paper she expressed frustration over Obama comparing smoking pot to consuming alcohol. ""Her comments are not necessarily unexpected,"" said Dan Riffle, director of federal policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, a pro pot legalization group. There are a lot of folks who have spent the last 20 to 30 years fighting the war on drugs. It's natural for them to revolt."" Still, the nation's attitudes and laws regarding marijuana are changing. During a drug policy debate at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he advocated decriminalizing marijuana. But he stopped short of pushing for legalization. However, the stance, coming from a Republican who once ran for President seems to offer further evidence of a change toward views on marijuana even in conservative corners. ""As the governor of the second-largest state in the country, what I can do is start us on policies that can start us on the road towards decriminalization,"" Perry said, adding that he views Colorado's marijuana laws as constitutional but he opposes a federal mandate. The politics of pot even hovered over this year's so-called ""Stoner Bowl"" as teams from Colorado and Washington faced off in New Jersey, a state where it's illegal to toke. As Super Bowl traffic curled through the Garden State toward Met Life Stadium, drivers had front row seats to an off-field battle of the billboards by pro and anti-marijuana legalization forces. ""Marijuana. Safer than alcohol ... and football,"" boasted a billboard by the Marijuana Policy Project. ""Marijuana kills your drive. Don't lose in the game of life,"" read the counter by Smart Approaches to Marijuana. Pot and the Super Bowl . Eventually though, both marijuana legalization advocates and opponents say, the federal government will have to clear the smoke. ""The real issue is: are we going to have a system where 25 states have legalization and 25 states don't?"" Gettman said, adding, ""Things are going to change dramatically after the next two elections in 2014 and 2016 when more states pass this."" The direction of federal pot policy could be determined by upcoming midterms and the 2016 presidential election as states weigh whether to legalize marijuana. There's big money at stake. Billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros gave $1 million in 2010 to help legalize marijuana in California, a vote which ultimately failed. He and fellow billionaires John Sperling and former Progressive Insurance chairman Peter Lewis, who died late last year, have donated millions to the pot legalization causes in a number of states. ""The long-hair, tie-dye types cut their hair and put on Armani suits and got very serious about pot,"" Sabet said adding that opponents worry marijuana could become ""the next big tobacco"" with billions of dollars at stake for a product they feel has serious health concerns. A slate of anti-government regulation, pro-states rights, GOP potential presidential candidates such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Perry will find their positions on marijuana tested by factions within their party that oppose legalization. Rubio opposes legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana for recreational use but recently told the Tampa Bay Times that he is open to learning more about medical marijuana. Last year, during an interview with the Hoover Institution, Paul said he is opposed to legalization but does support decriminalization. One place for common ground might be in efforts to decriminalize the penalties for marijuana-related crimes, opponents and advocates say. The push to decriminalize pot has made for some unlikely partnerships. Obama on the problem of criminalizing marijuana use . For example, liberal Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont teamed up with Paul, a tea party backed conservative on a measure aimed at changing mandatory minimum sentences for some crimes such like marijuana possession. The measure also has the support of Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. Tea party backed Republican Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho and Congressional Black Caucus member Rep. Robert Scott, D-Virginia have joined forces on a similar measure that would judges more wiggle room in sentencing. Obama, civil rights organizations and both pro and anti-marijuana legalization groups all acknowledge that minorities are often disproportionately incarcerated for pot-related crimes. ""My concern is when you end up having very heavy criminal penalties for individual users that have been applied unevenly and in some cases with a racial disparity,"" Obama told Tapper during the CNN interview. ""I think that is a problem.""","Obama administration largely taking a pass on bumper crop of state pot laws .

"(CNN) -- Two advocacy groups filed a federal complaint Tuesday alleging a North Carolina school district's treatment of three Latino families was discriminatory because it did not provide important information in Spanish. The Southern Poverty Law Center and Advocates for Children's Services, a project of Legal Aid of North Carolina, filed the complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice's Office for Civil Rights. They say that in the cases of three students and their Spanish-speaking parents, the Wake County Public School System failed to provide documents about the students' suspensions in Spanish. That meant the parents, who speak limited English, were unable to ask questions or even appeal the suspensions, which discriminated against them on the basis of national origin and violated their civil rights, the groups say. The school district responded by saying it has many programs in place to support and inform Latino and Spanish-speaking families. It also provided forms in Spanish,including notification of suspension, a form for parents to request information on disciplinary actions, and confirmation that a parent has made an appeal. The school district has had the Spanish-language forms since the mid-1990s, said Samiha Khanna, spokeswoman for the district's Office of Family and Community Engagement. After media inquiries about the groups' complaints, Superintendent Tony Tata said last month, ""We have been proactively engaging all students and families in the Wake County Public School System, including those in the Latino community."" North Carolina's capital, Raleigh, is in Wake County. He added that ""as a district, WCPSS has developed relationships with key community groups, leaders and media partners to support the needs of our Spanish-speaking families."" The district has several measures to help Spanish-speaking families understand school policies, including Spanish-language parental training, explanation of policies through Spanish-language media and bilingual customer service representatives. The advocacy groups said the Spanish-language forms did not help the three families in these cases. ""Whether they gave these parents the blank forms themselves in Spanish, in no instances in these cases did they provide the form in writing with individualized information about their students in Spanish,"" said Sean Driscoll, spokesman for Legal Aid of North Carolina. ""They may have given them the form, but the form didn't include the individualized information about their students in Spanish."" Jerri Katzerman, the deputy legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, also said the Spanish-language forms are often filled in using English, with descriptive information about students left out. ""It's inadequate, and it certainly doesn't benefit the family who's trying to participate in the child's education,"" she said. ""These are the absolute core and key responsibilities of a school system,"" she added, especially because of the number of Latino and Spanish-speaking families in the Wake County district. Latino students comprise 15% of the district's student population, the advocacy groups said, and students with parents who speak limited English are 7.5%. As part of the same complaint, the Southern Poverty Law Center is also representing an unidentified class of students and their families with the same allegation of discrimination, Katzerman said. The three students specifically represented by the advocacy groups, who are identified only by their initials, were all recommended for long-term suspensions and have mothers who speak limited English, the groups said. The first case is that of a 12-year-old with a learning disability. The school's information about his suspension was in English, so the student's mother didn't know she could appeal, the groups said. The second student was a ninth-grader, also with a learning disability. After she was accused of smoking marijuana on campus, the school recommended she be suspended for the rest of the school year. The girl's mother could not understand the assistant principal when he called to discuss her daughter's suspension, and the mother was unable to ask questions, the groups said. Letters about her daughter's disciplinary actions were also in English, they said. In the third case, the student was suspended after being accused of marijuana possession, and the notice of his suspension was sent to the student's mother in English only. The mother wanted to appeal but wasn't given information in Spanish about her son's alleged offense. The mother also requested her son be tested for special education services, but all of the written information about his eligibility was in English, they said. By the time the mother managed to appeal her son's suspension, he had been out of school for more than three weeks because the mother had missed the deadline because of her limited English, the groups said.","Complaint filed against school district in Wake County, North Carolina .

"(CNN) -- With spectacular mountains, vibrant hill tribes and a relaxed vibe, Thailand's unofficial ""second city"" of Chiang Mai is everything Bangkok isn't. As the travel hub for northern Thailand, the city of Chiang Mai and the province that shares its name (population 1.6 million) blend ancient culture and natural wonders to create a character that's unique to a region once known as the Kingdom of a Million Rice Fields, or ""Lanna"" in Thai. In a kind of repeat of history, parts of the city have been invaded by regional neighbors in recent years. In the past, invaders came from Burma, Siam or other regional rivals. This time, it's tour groups from China, lured by the success of a massive-hit Chinese comedy movie called ""Lost in Thailand,"" which is partially based in Chiang Mai. Fortunately, you can still lose yourself in Chiang Mai's majestic mountains, find a quiet picnic spot next to a cascading stream or visit with its friendly people. 1. Eating khao soi . Nothing says ""I'm in Chiang Mai"" more than slurping a piquant bowl of khao soi, noodles bathed in an intense curry broth topped with crispy noodles. The dish is traditionally served with chicken or beef with a side of chili paste, pickled cabbage, raw shallots and wedge of lime. Arguably northern Thailand's most famous dish, khao soi can be found from unnamed holes-in-the-wall to five-star resorts, all peddling renditions of the ""best"" noodles money can buy. For a fail-safe lunchtime introduction, Lam Duan Faham or Samoer Jai, both on Chiang Mai's Charoenrat Road, are terrific choices. A glass of the herbal drink bai bua bok (Asian pennywort) helps you cool off after the spicy meal. 2. Camping under the stars . With seven national parks in the province, many door-to-doi (mountain) excursions are within easy striking distance of the Chiang Mai city center. You can pitch your own tent at designated campsites or rent one on arrival from the park headquarters. Most parks also have cabins or huts for rent, though these must be reserved, easiest via the Department of National Parks website. Ob Luang National Park, with its dramatic river-canyon landscape littered with boulders, and Doi Inthanon National Park, named after the highest peak in the country, offer waterfall and cave attractions by day and stargazing by night. Both are within a two-hour drive from town. 3. Visiting Doi Suthep . Presiding over the mountainous horizon to the northwest of the city, Doi Suthep mountain is the most recognizable landmark in Chiang Mai. Its glimmering mountaintop temple is a popular first stop for visitors. Most make the trek up the 300-plus steps of the Naga staircase to visit the working monastery in the daytime, from which, weather permitting, you can get panoramic views of the city. A better time to go is in the early hours of the morning, when you can avoid the heat and crowds, and watch the flickering lights of the city fade as the sun rises. The climb to the top is a thigh-buster, but it's worth it for the great views. There's also a scenic road up Doi Suthep for those who prefer to drive. 4. Trekking to hill tribe villages . Nearby hills or dois mean there are plenty of nature-based day trips in the area, often with a waterfall to cool off in. Tour operators will often combine a handful of excursions in a single day. The best and priciest outfits in town provide private customized tours that allow you to choose your activities and not be herded along with the crowd. A great leisurely activity, bamboo rafting in Mae Wang provides a closeup introduction to the region's lush forests. To admire the greenery from top down, Flight of the Gibbon in Mae Kampong offers 5 kilometers of zip line through a forest canopy. The village of Mae Klang Luang is big on community-based tourism. It's a place to stop for a freshly brewed cup of coffee while overlooking terraced rice paddies before following a local guide on a 3-kilometer trek to a ""hidden"" waterfall. 5. Getting a foot massage at the market . In recent years, a slew of modern malls has sprung up in the city. But Chiang Mai's vibrant street markets are still the place to get the classic retail experience. The best choices are the nightly bazaar on Chang Klan Road; Saturday Walking Street on Wualai Road; and Sunday Walking Street down Ratchadamnoen Road inside the old city walls. Sunday Walking Street is the most popular of the bunch, with back-to-back vendors selling trinkets, boutique fashion and handicrafts. With shopping comes sore feet. Fortunately, entrepreneurial massage ladies have that covered -- in the market, rows of plastic chairs set up on the pavement lure shoppers with $5-an-hour foot rubs. You can get your feet rubbed while sipping on a drink from the market and watching crowds amble past. 6. Celebrating local festivals . Festivals in Chiang Mai are celebrated with boisterous party fervor and observance of ancient traditions. One of the best holidays is Songkran, the Thai New Year, observed over three official days but often lasting five days each April (dates change every year). Cultural activities are centered around Wat Phra Singh, the city's most visited temple, and the old town. To take part in Chiang Mai's famed full-fledged water fight, you need to pick a strategic station and get ready to get wet -- Tha Pae Gate, anywhere along the moat, next to the Ping River, around Central Kad Suan Kaew and Maya shopping centers, are areas of intense activity and big crowds. Another festival worth planning a trip to Chiang Mai around is Loy Krathong, which coincides with the Lanna festival of Yi Peng. On that November night (again, the dates change annually), tens of thousands of paper lanterns (khom loy) are set off into the sky and thousands more candle-lit floats are released along waterways. The best photo op is at the mass release behind Maejo University. 7. Bundling up for ""winter"" When the year-end holidays roll around and the mercury dips below 20 C (68 F), the cardigans and beanies come out as city folk head for Chiang Mai to enjoy the ""winter."" Visitors tend to follow suit, putting away the tank tops and cutoffs and bundling up for the weather as they head for higher ground up in the dois. It really does get chilly. Hot springs suddenly make sense, especially if you stay the night to experience the misty mornings and maximum nighttime chills in the hills. Best day-trip spots for a steamy soak are the Fang Hot Springs at Doi Pha Hom Pok National Park and, closer to Chiang Mai, Pong Duead at Huay Nam Dang National Park. Both have hiking trails and impressive viewpoints. 8. Taking a road trip . The roads around Chiang Mai are some of the most scenic in the country. One of the best known is the Mae Hong Son Loop, a 600-kilometer journey that starts from Chiang Mai, and, traveling counterclockwise, passes through Pai, Mae Hong Son and Mae Sariang before returning to the starting point. Driving yourself is the best way to do this multiday excursion -- car and motorbike rental shops are found all over the city -- allowing you to stop to admire the mountainous landscape, visit small villages and swim beneath waterfalls. The shorter, 100-kilometer Samoeng Loop makes for an easy day trip. It passes through Hang Dong and Mae Rim just outside of town. Both of these loops have food stops along the way, but it never hurts to have bags of sai-ua (northern Thai herb sausages) and sticky rice for a spontaneous hillside picnic en route. 9. Relaxing . The pace of life in Chiang Mai is refreshingly slower than in Bangkok, giving it a sleepy ambiance that adds to its charm. To indulge in the chilled-out lifestyle, you'll want to kick back in a waterside setting with views of the mountainous surroundings and, of course, good food. About an hour's drive from town, and a longtail boat ride away, you can dine in one of the floating restaurants in Mae Ngat Reservoir in Sri Lanna National Park -- there's nothing to do here but eat, drink, swim and be merry. Houseboats can be rented by the day, and if you can't tear yourself away from the scenic surroundings, it's worth staying overnight. Closer to town, Huay Tung Tao lake has a similar food-nature-and-not-much-else appeal. Located close to the base of Doi Suthep, the lake is dotted with private open air huts on the water's edge where you can order food from nearby restaurants, swim and just whittle away the day enjoying the moment. Very relaxed, very Chiang Mai. GALLERY: Chiang Mai's laid-back street style . 10. Seeing the city from the sky . For the best view of the city, you can reach for the skies in a basket. Weather permitting, Balloon Adventure Thailand (+66 84 611 4128) offers twice-daily hot air balloon flights year-round. Rides last about 90 minutes. Morning flights tend to be smoother, and you can enjoy views of rice paddies, sprawling valley floors and 360-degree doi-scapes. It's quiet up here, so you can be alone with your thoughts, which will most likely turn to the champagne breakfast awaiting at the end of the ride.","Chiang Mai and the province of the same name blend ancient culture and natural wonders .

"London, England (CNN) -- Prince William's younger brother Prince Harry will be his best man when he marries Kate Middleton in London in April, Clarence House announced Monday. Middleton's sister Philippa will be her maid of honor. William, who is second in line to the throne, is due to marry his long-time girlfriend April 29 at Westminster Abbey. Prince Harry is currently third in line of succession. Royal protocol states that the groom should have a ""supporter"" rather than a Best Man and speculation was rife that Prince Harry would be named supporter, and another friend of Prince William announced as his best man. Prince Charles elected his brother Prince Andrew to be his ""supporter"" when he married Diana, Princess of Wales in 1981. Naming Harry best man is a break with protocol, and is being taken as an indication of William and Kate's more modern approach to their upcoming wedding, which is taking place at Westminster Abbey on April 29. Harry will be organizing the Prince's ""stag"" or bachelor party. Meanwhile Philippa, or ""Pippa,"" will be expected to pull together Kate's ""hen"" or bachelorette party. William's office at Clarence House also announced that there will be four bridesmaids and two page boys, including two of William's godchildren. They are Grace van Cutsem, 3, and Tom Pettifer, 8. Pettifer is the son of Tiggy Pettifer, William and Harry's former nanny -- an important figure in the young Princes' lives, especially following the death of their mother in 1997. Lady Louise Windsor, 7, the Hon. Margarita Armstrong-Jones, 8, and Eliza Lopes, 3, will be the other bridesmaids. Lady Windsor, is the daughter of the Earl and Countess of Wessex as well as being the Queen's granddaughter, while Armstrong-Jones, Prince William's second cousin, is the daughter of Viscount and Viscountess Linley. Lopes, meanwhile, is the granddaughter of Prince William's stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall. William ""Billy"" Lowther-Pinkerton, 10, the son of Prince William's private secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, will be the other page boy. Details regarding the Bridesmaid's dresses and Page Boys' uniforms will remain a secret until the day of the wedding, Clarence House said. Notable royals who have been left off the list include the Prince's cousin, Zara Phillips, who also announced her own engagement last year.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Cloaked in a traditional flowing red and saffron Tibetan robe the Dalai Lama took a deep breath as he began to express his gratitude to the country that took him in as a refugee 50 years ago. The Dalai Lama says he is grateful for the care and support he has received from India. ""I think in this country (there are) many other refugees,"" the Dalai Lama reflected, sitting cross legged. ""But we are I think (the) most fortunate and successful refugee community because of (the) government of India's care and support."" His journey to India was a treacherous one. The year was 1959. Tibetans had staged an uprising against Chinese rule and the security forces reacted with force. The Dalai Lama's followers, who consider him a living God -- the latest reincarnation in a long lineage of revered monks -- were worried about his fate under the Chinese. He was, after all, just 23 years old. On March 17 that year, the 14th Dalai Lama fled his homeland on horseback. A half century later, the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people recounted to CNN that day and the subsequent journey to India. ""Most fearful sort of moment is... (the) night of 17 March 1959,"" he said. The Dalai Lama and some of his followers were about to cross a river on horseback when they suddenly realized they were within sight of a Chinese army camp. ""Soldiers, yes, we can see,"" the Dalai Lama said, learning forward, his eyes wide and voice strong. ""We are very much afraid.""  Watch the Dalai Lama recount his difficult journey » . The fear, amplified by the harsh conditions. The bitter cold and thin air of the Himalayas assaulted their bodies as they slowly made the trek over the mountains. ""(We had) practical sort of problem, difficulties. High mountain. If you try to walk then... breathing difficulties, but on horse too much cold,"" the Dalai Lama said, laughing aloud. ""Hand and foot become frozen."" But he made it, as have tens of thousands of his followers who came to India in a similar fashion.  Watch why the Dalai Lama thinks China should spy on him more » . The Indian government took in the refugees and helped resettle them. One of the biggest Tibetan towns is Dharamsala, in the mountainous state of Himachal Pradesh. The town has become the headquarters for the Tibetan government in exile. And that's where things begin to get sticky for the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan community. When India took in the exiles, it told the Tibetans to refrain from political activity, certainly of the anti-China kind. But the status of Tibet has created its own dynamic: the Dalai Lama's own followers and activists around the world look to the spiritual leader to keep pushing the Tibetan cause. China has long accused the Dalai Lama of orchestrating political maneuvers against China from his post in India. They blame him for inciting violence in the most recent uprising in the Tibetan region in March 2008. The Dalai Lama fervently denies the allegations and says he is interested only in exploring wider autonomy for Tibetans in China. His envoys have held talks with Chinese representatives, but the status of their homeland remains in dispute. The Dalai Lama and his followers walk a fine line between religion and politics in India, which is also home away from home. On the 50th anniversary of his stay here, the Dalai Lama traveled to eight places of worship around New Delhi, paying tribute to the religious diversity of his host country and the welcome he's been given by the Indian government and people. ""Naturally, sometimes (a) little disagreement may come but (it) doesn't matter because there is basic trust,"" the Dalai Lama said. ""And spiritually we consider Indians our guru, our teacher, because we are Buddhists. Buddhism comes from India. So therefore spiritually we are very close to this country.

"Misrata, Libya (CNN) -- NATO said Tuesday that it lost contact with a U.S. unmanned helicopter flying surveillance for the organization over the central coastal area of Libya. Contact with the Fire Scout was lost at 7:20 a.m., said Wing Cmdr. Mike Bracken, a NATO spokesman. A Pentagon source told CNN that the Fire Scout belonged to the U.S. Navy. Libyan state television reported that an ""Apache helicopter was downed in the area of Majr in Zliten,"" claiming it was the fifth NATO aircraft to be downed. An Apache is a manned attack helicopter. Bracken denied that NATO had lost any attack helicopters during the alliance's mission in Libya. The loss for NATO came as the military chiefs of the 15 nations participating in the Libya campaign met in London and two influential U.S. senators introduced a resolution expressing support for limited U.S. involvement in Libya -- part of an effort to counter rising pressure from U.S. lawmakers to withdraw backing for the mission. The resolution, introduced by John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and John McCain, R-Arizona, authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops. Libya state TV on Tuesday reported a NATO strike southwest of Tripoli in Nalut city, resulting in ""material and human damages."" Libyan forces were also continuing their attacks. At 6 p.m. in Misrata, a CNN employee saw three Grad-type rockets strike the center of the city, slightly wounding a 13-year-old boy in front of a bicycle shop. In Dafniya, between Tripoli and Misrata, five rebels were killed and 31 were wounded in clashes along the frontline, according to officials at Misrata's Al-Hikma Hospital. The Libyan war erupted from anti-government protests in February. Following a United Nations mandate to protect civilians, NATO began bombing military targets in March. However, strongman Moammar Gadhafi still maintains control in Tripoli. Tuesday, Human Rights Watch said that Libyan government forces had planted more than 150 landmines in at least one location in the Nafusa Mountains in western Libya. The global monitoring group visited the site, inspected mines that had been removed, and interviewed the rebel fighters who removed them. ""These antipersonnel landmines pose a huge threat to civilians,"" said Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch. ""More than 150 countries have banned landmines, but Libya continues to defy this global trend."" The human rights group said it has confirmed Gadhafi's use of five types of landmines in six locations in Libya. NATO officials stressed that it was Gadhafi who was deliberately and indiscriminately targeting his own people as the alliance faced questions over a series of incidents over the weekend and into Monday that resulted in allegations of civilian casualties and strikes on Libyan opposition vehicles. ""Let's not lose sight that it is the Gadhafi regime which started this crisis,"" Bracken said. Libya said that 15 people, including three children, were killed in Monday's incident. Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said the attack included strikes from eight rockets. ""You are planting the seeds of hatred, NATO,"" Ibrahim said. Five houses and a farm were hit Sunday in the Surman area, west of Tripoli, he said. One of the homes belongs to Khaled el-Kweldi, a top aide to Gadhafi, Ibrahim said. The Libyan leader was not home at the time of the attack, but three children were killed, Ibrahim said. NATO said a residential building west of Tripoli was targeted early Monday. ""NATO is aware of allegations that this strike caused civilian casualties,"" Bracken said. ""That is something we cannot independently verify, but I say again that this was a legitimate military target."" He would not detail how NATO came to determine that the target was a command-and-control communications node except to say that 17 satellite dishes could be seen in aerial imagery. Bracken said the center was involved in coordinating attacks on the Libyan people. Monday's strike in Surman came a day after NATO acknowledged an errant airstrike in Tripoli may have caused ""a number of civilian casualties."" Libya's government said Sunday that nine people were killed and six wounded when a NATO strike hit a residential neighborhood in the Libyan capital. NATO said Sunday that a military missile site was the intended target. ""However, it appears that one weapon did not strike the intended target and that there may have been a weapons system failure,"" a NATO statement said. On Saturday, NATO expressed regret after its aircraft mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition in the key and hotly contested eastern oil city of al-Brega. Meanwhile, Libyan opposition leader Mahmoud Jibril arrived Tuesday in Beijing for meetings with Chinese officials, state media reported. Jibril, chairman of the executive board of the opposition Transitional National Council, will be in China for two days, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei. ""China's major task is to promote peace and encourage talks,"" Hong said. ""China has followed closely the development of the situation in Libya, and calls for the political resolution of the Libyan crisis."" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the rebels ""an important political power of Libya."" That recognition comes a month after Jibril said that China bolstered the opposition movement's stature by purchasing a shipment of oil from the opposition group for $160 million. ""We have maintained contacts with both sides of Libya, and urge them to take actions that are conducive to the interest of the people of the country,"" Hong said. ""We believe that the future of Libya should be determined by the Libyan people themselves, and China will respect the independent choice of the Libyan people."" In May, Jibril met in Paris with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Prime Minister Francois Fillon. France has been a strong backer of the Libyan rebels and the NATO air campaign. Also in May, Jibril tried to secure formal recognition for the interim council from the White House, but failed. Since then, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the United States views the group as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people. For weeks, NATO forces have been targeting forces loyal to Gadhafi in an effort to prevent them from inflicting civilian casualties. Most of those strikes have come from missiles fired from ships located offshore or from aircraft flying above the North African nation.

"(CNN) -- Attention white Anglo-Saxon Protestants: Your days of running things are over. You have jumped the shark. But there's no need to feel bad for WASPs. They've had an amazing run. Every single president in our nation's history, except for John F. Kennedy -- a Catholic -- and Barack Obama, has been a white Protestant. Except for a handful of exceptions, for over 200 years the presidential nominees of both major political parties have been WASPs. WASPs had almost as many victories in a row as The Harlem Globetrotters. But it's over. Look at this year's presidential tickets: A Mormon, an African-American, and two Catholics. Even some of the keynote speakers at the Democratic and Republican conventions were not WASPs. The GOP featured Italian-Irish Catholic Chris Christie and the Democrats tapped Latino-American, Julian Castro. Times are so bleak for WASPs that there's not a single one on the Supreme Court. Likewise, in Congress, the percentage of Protestants fell from 74 percent in 1961 to a slim majority of 55 percent today. Neither the current Speaker of the House (John Boehner: Catholic) nor the Senate majority leader (Harry Reid: Mormon) is WASP. I'm sincerely not gloating. And my jibes are in jest. But what I'm happy about is that our two major political parties are increasingly reflecting the new face of America. The demographics of our nation are changing and, by 2042, minorities are expected to become the majority in the U.S. Objectively, the delegates at this year's Democratic convention were far more diverse. The Republican convention looked more like the early bird dinner crowd at The Cracker Barrel. Opinion: In Ohio, candidates are salesmen trying to close the deal . However, in the GOP's defense, a party that is 90% white, they have started to slowly showcase minorities, such as Sen. Marco Rubio and Govs. Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal. They are well aware that if they don't, the GOP will go the way of the Whigs. There's little doubt that we will see more diverse presidential candidates. And we will likely see in the not too distant future a president who is Latino, Asian, Jewish, Sikh or Muslim. (That screaming sound you might have heard was Michele Bachmann shrieking in horror at the idea of a Muslim-American president.) This is a testament to our nation. We are by our very nature progressive. It may take years, or even decades, to see change, but we always march forward, not back. So, how did we get to where we are today where the white Protestant establishment seems to be losing power? Well, it's kind of complicated (as these things tend to be). There are tons of reasons. But one important factor that has contributed to today's political landscape is changing voting rights laws. Back in the days when our nation was founded, only white men who owned land could vote. That means rich white men with money get to control the political system. (I know some of you are thinking: How is that different than today?) In our first presidential election in 1789, no women, no blacks, no poor white men, and in many states neither Catholics nor Jews, were permitted to vote. Over time, some states abandoned the requirement of land ownership so that poor white men could vote. And the religious restrictions were also lifted so that non-Protestants were able to vote. Opinion: Democrats and Republicans need a plan to keep American dream alive . However, it wasn't until after 1870, when the 15th Amendment was ratified, that black American citizens were finally guaranteed the right to vote. (Although poll taxes, literacy laws and other measures were still employed in some states to disenfranchise black voters.) And it took all the way to 1920 -- more than 100 years after our first president was elected -- that women were finally given the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment to our Constitution. Enfranchising voters of all backgrounds has led to the opening up of our democratic process. Minorities no longer just voted -- they became active in politics. And they didn't just show up at political meetings -- over time they sought elective offices. And some of them won. With each success, they inspire even more minorities of every race, ethnicity and religion to become active in our political system. So WASPs, you've had your great run. And there is no doubt that another white Protestant will rise up one day against the growing odds and win the White House. But until that day comes, you can console yourself knowing that a white Protestant male is one of the most exciting athletes in our nation today: Tim Tebow. (Of course, he is the back up to Mark Sanchez.) The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Every president except for JFK and Barack Obama has been a white Protestant .

"(CNN) -- Part of the enduring appeal of YouTube is the sheer random nature of it all -- the way videos of a South Korean pop song or a doped-up kid after a dentist visit can go from obscure to internationally known in a matter of days. But increasingly, the Web's leading video site has also been working to become the Internet's cable provider, mixing channels of its own original content, often in partnership with established stars, into the mix. Last October, YouTube announced 100 new channels, featuring everything from sports to comedy to educational videos. On Monday, it announced plans for another 40, with an international bent that includes channels from France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The site also rolled out some impressive numbers about how the project has gone so far. YouTube says its top 25 original channels average more than 1 million views per week. About 800 million people are watching 4 billion hours of content on its original channels every month, an increase from 3 billion earlier this year. ""From local cuisine, health and wellness and parenting to sports, music, comedy, animation and news, this new lineup of original channels will have something for everyone,"" said Robert Kyncl, YouTube's global head of content, in a blog post. ""They are backed by some of the biggest producers, well-known celebrities and emerging media companies from Europe and the U.S."" The new offerings include ""The Jamie Oliver Food Channel,"" from England, German auto channel Motorvision and ""city magazine"" Rendezvous a Paris from France. New U.S. offerings include health-food channel Super Foods, The Creators Project from Vice and Above Average Productions, featuring short comedy clips by writers from ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""30 Rock,"" the Lonely Island comedy troupe and elsewhere. Just getting started with YouTube's original channels? Here are five we think might be of interest to CNN Tech readers: . TED-Ed . TED (Technology, Education and Design) is a series of conferences designed to bring together serious thinkers in an effort to share ""ideas worth spreading."" TED-Ed is an initiative that grew out of that. It is a curated series of education videos, which are good for teachers in need of extra resources. They are allowed to customize the videos to suit their needs and share them, publicly or privately, free. It's also fun for anybody looking to bone up on Newton's laws or learn how to write great essays. Advisers to the project include Salman Khan of Khan Academies, Melinda Gates and Jackie Bezos, the co-director of the education-oriented Bezos Family Foundation and mother of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Geek & Sundry . Celebrating all things geektastic, ""Geek & Sundry"" is helmed by Felicia Day, an icon of sorts in the world of Internet fandom who brought her groundbreaking Web series, ""The Guild,"" to the channel. Other top draws include the video version of the ""Sword & Laser"" podcast, in which Tom Merritt and Veronica Belmont (he a host and she an alum of ""This Week In Tech,"") talk science fiction and fantasy literature, and ""Tabletop,"" featuring actor Wil Wheaton and guests talking about, and playing, board games. For related, but unique, material, also check out ""The Nerdist"" podcast host Chris Hardwick's channel. The Warner Sound . OK, we know this might look shameless, but it's not. (The Warner Music Group spun off from Time Warner, which owns CNN, in 2004). Besides, this has been the No. 1 original YouTube channel every week since June. Yes, Warner is a music juggernaut, and you'll find the occasional video by platinum artists like Flo Rida and Green Day. But TWS celebrates ""the other side of music"" and the majority of posts feature more alternative, lesser known or up-and-coming acts (LP, Tegan & Sara, The Mars Volta, Santigold). Our favorite bit of weirdness? ""The Gorburger Show,"" in which a space alien who has hijacked a Japanese variety show interviews musical acts. SciShow . Whether it's a 10-minute biography of enigmatic inventor Nikola Tesla (Thomas Edison gets called an ""asshat"") or explaining the makeup of bath salts, the amphetamine that makes people do ""bat-crap crazy"" things, veteran video-blogger Hank Green makes science both understandable and fun. That is, when he's not running an online record label, playing his own music or writing or recording videos for, like, 100 other blogs and websites. Soul Pancake . On Soul Pancake, ""The Office"" actor Rainn Wilson invites you to ""open your heart without feeling like an idiot."" An extension of his website by the same name, Soul Pancake is informed by Wilson's Baha'i faith and challenges viewers to consider issues of spirituality, philosophy and creativity, among other heady topics. ""We need connection. We need compassion. We need nurturing,"" Wilson said at last year's South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. If that sounds heavy, know that it's sprinkled with Wilson's wit. A recent video calling for a holiday on Election Day, featured (for some reason) an 18th century sharecropper with gold coins hidden in his posterior.","YouTube adds 40 channels, many with international focus, to its original-content lineup .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts woman is calling Lt. Gov. Tim Murray a hero for helping her two grandchildren to safety after the minivan in which they were riding caught fire. Murray was driving Tuesday evening in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he lives, according to a statement from the governor's office. ""[He] noticed a parked minivan with a tire on fire. The Lt. Governor pulled over, dialed 911, and as he was doing so, heard a nearby individual scream that there were children in the vehicle,"" according to the statement. ""The Lt. Governor approached the vehicle and helped the children get out safely to their grandmother, who was nearby."" Firefighters extinguished the fire. ""The Lt. Governor is happy that everyone is safe,"" the statement said. Ruth-Ann Manozzi told CNN Boston affiliate WHDH she had pulled over to pick up a friend. As Manozzi got out of the minivan to inform her friend of her arrival, Murray drove by and noticed her tire was on fire, the station reported. According to Manozzi, the fire was spreading and Murray, a former mayor of the city, dumped a pail of water on the tire. His rescue attempt frightened the minivan occupants at first, however. ""And there's this man trying to force open the car door, and the kids are locking it. The first thing you think is someone's trying to get into your car,"" Manozzi told WHDH. ""I was gonna smack him. I yelled, 'Get away from my car!' "" said Manozzi. Murray, who helped pull the children out of the minivan after they unlocked the doors, downplayed his actions Wednesday. ""I'm lucky she didn't punch me in the nose,"" Murray said. ""Like any good grandmother, she was worried about her kids' safety.""","Lt. Gov. Tim Murray of Massachusetts saw a van tire on fire .

"(CNN) -- For Rebecca James, the onset of ""Beatlemania"" meant one thing: a lot of waiting. ""I waited eagerly for them to arrive in the U.S."" she said. ""I waited for them appear on 'Ed Sullivan,' for each album, for my concert tickets, for the concert, for class to end so I could listen to my Beatles records. They were worth the wait."" The Indianapolis resident was a freshman at William Woods University in Fulton, Missouri, on February 9, 1964, the night The Beatles made their first appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" ""A group of us went to a professor's house to watch,"" she recalled. The band performed on the variety show for three consecutive Sundays, and James dutifully tuned in each time. ""They were cute, funny and talented,"" she gushed. Of course, James didn't just watch The Beatles on TV and listen to their records at home. On September 3, 1964, she and a friend joined the throngs of other Beatles fans at a concert in Indianapolis. ""We were in the nosebleed section at the Coliseum and barely heard a note for the screaming,"" James remembered. ""The amplifiers were very small by today's standards."" She still has the ticket and photos from that day. Those screaming fans were just the beginning. The Beatles' arrival in the United States -- 50 years ago next month -- marked the start of John, Paul, George and Ringo's history-making path of pop culture dominance. More on ""The Sixties: The British Invasion"" 'I had it and I lived it' For Diane Salsbery, The Beatles' ""Ed Sullivan"" appearance marked the beginning of an obsession that lives on today. Her home in Phoenix houses a massive collection of memorabilia, including all the original albums, the script of their film ""A Hard Day's Night,"" (which she saw eight times upon its initial release), collectible Beatles dolls, and a Beatles poster from ""16"" magazine. She remembers the early days of ""Beatlemania"" as ""magical for me and millions of other teenage girls."" ""We all watched the 'Ed Sullivan Show' on our black and white TV sets and fell in love with their music, youthful energy and appearance. Looking back they were very clean-cut looking, but our parents didn't think so!"" Salsbery grew up in a small town in West Virginia, where she said it was difficult to listen to the latest music. ""My brother rigged up a wire from his bedroom window across the creek behind our house so we could pick up the BBC on an old shortwave radio,"" she remembered. ""He was also in a band and when they would rehearse down in our basement I would sit on the steps and pretend they were The Beatles rehearsing!"" And Friday nights meant ""Beatles sleepovers"" for Salsbery and her friends, when they would listen to Beatles albums and daydream for hours. ""Talk about Beatlemania, I had it and lived it."" The next year, she took the opportunity to see the quartet perform in person. She traveled by bus the long distance from West Virginia to New York to see The Beatles perform what would become a legendary concert in Shea Stadium on August 15, 1965. ""It was a very hot, humid evening with thousands in the audience all chanting 'We Love You Beatles, Oh Yes We Do' while waiting,"" Salsbery said. ""When The Beatles ran out onto the field, the sound in the stadium was incredible, with over 55,000 screaming teenagers, myself included."" ""It was an amazing feeling seeing them. None of us knew it would be an historic concert; we were just caught up in the moment seeing The Beatles."" By that point, The Beatles' popularity ""across the pond"" had made its way to other countries around the world, showing just how much of a cultural touchstone that February concert would become. Beatlemania spreads worldwide . Living in Ontario, Canada, in 1964, Rita Stamp was just as crazy about The Beatles as her American counterparts. One of her most treasured memories is opening a pack of bubble gum and finding a photo of the ""Fab Four"" themselves. The surprise caused quite a commotion among her siblings but her mother wasn't quite as pleased. Stamp remembers her mother telling her to calm down ""and stop being so crazy over these young boys."" She didn't approve of their long hair. Despite her mother's feelings, Stamp, then 14, quickly plastic-wrapped her photo of the Fab Four and displayed it on her bedroom wall until she left home two years later. ""Since then, it has become a special piece of memorabilia that I hold close to my heart,"" said Stamp. ""It represents a piece of my childhood, and that is priceless."" Beatlemania didn't just affect women. Kurt Bentzen of Copenhagen, Denmark, became a Beatles fan in 1963 and is still one today; he attended a Paul McCartney concert as recently as 2009. At age 12, and knowing very little English, he stood transfixed one day in the schoolyard while hearing a song. It turned out to be The Beatles' ""She Loves You."" Bentzen was hooked. He and a friend found it in a music booth at a record store; he listened to it 25 times and learned the lyrics by heart. After listening to many of their records, Bentzen said The Beatles taught him how to speak English. ""The lyrics got more sophisticated and so did our vocabulary,"" he said. Bentzen said he ""almost fainted"" when hearing the lyrics, ""Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs / Of every head he's had the pleasure to know."" ""Pure poetry."" Bentzen, a management consultant, credits the Fab Four for his success in life. ""Now many years later I have lived in eight different countries and professionally traveled the world. I got the jobs because during interviews my English was superior to other Danes."" Meanwhile in Venezuela, ""The Beatles changed everything: Social lives and music,"" according to Marina Lares of Caracas. Lares explained that Beatlemania influenced how young people behaved in Venezuela in the early 1960s. ""The boys let their hair grow longer"" and began to form rock bands, she said. Girls started to wear miniskirts, boots and attended parties without chaperones for the first time. ""Adults and adolescents used to dance 'merengues' and 'boleros' with the Billo's Caracas Boys, a famous Venezuelan Latin music orchestra, but since Beatlemania, adolescents wanted to dance to rock more than anything else,"" Lares recalled. ""Parties started to be different, since the music was different, and in a way part of our identity changed."" Of course, there were also the ever-present Beatles posters in her room. Although they were thousands of miles away, Lares' teenage memories sound identical to the ones that Salsbery and others described. ""My bedroom was the meeting location to hang out and listen to their fabulous music that marked our lives forever,"" she said. More: The Beatles in color .

"(CNN) -- It all started with a New Year's Eve party. The cushy gig probably sounded irresistible to singing sensations like BeyoncÃ©, Usher and Mariah Carey: a private concert in the luxurious Caribbean island of St. Barts to ring in a new year before a group of dignitaries who were big fans. But that was before everything came to light, courtesy of WikiLeaks. Those artists and others, including Nelly Furtado and rapper 50 Cent, have recently faced sharp criticism for accepting payments for performances from the family of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The scandal highlights how very easily stars can find themselves smack dab in the middle of a major political firestorm for simply doing what they do best: making money for their talents. In February, it was reported that cables obtained by the secrets-revealing WikiLeaks website detailed lavish spending by Gadhafi's sons, including large sums of money paid to American singers for performances. Within the past few days, BeyoncÃ©, Usher, Carey and Furtado have announced that they either have donated or plan to donate the money earned to charities. Carey recently released a statement saying she was embarrassed by the scandal. ""Going forward, this is a lesson for all artists to learn from,"" the singer said. ""We need to be more aware and take more responsibility regardless of who books our shows. Ultimately we as artists are to be held accountable."" ""You really have to be very careful and do your research,"" said Matthew ""Mateo"" Rajkumar, chief executive officer of the American Talent Agency. ""You have to make sure you know where the money is coming from."" Rajkumar's company specializes in booking urban American music artists overseas, with a heavy concentration in the markets of Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. His clients have included big names in hip-hop like Fat Joe, Missy Elliott, Wyclef Jean and Busta Rhymes. Rajkumar said an intense vetting process is crucial to making sure artists don't find themselves performing for dictators or accepting ""blood money."" He said he recently had to turn down gigs in North Africa for artists like singer Chrissette Michele because the deal didn't meet his standards. ""It's such a coincidence in that we recently turned down a deal coming from people we have worked with in Uganda, where we had offers in Libya that we turned down,"" he said. ""When I say recently, I mean before the recent uprising. We do everything we can to make sure we are protecting our artists."" The CEO said his company was one of the first to see the potential market abroad for celebrity artists and brokered a deal in 2008 for 50 Cent to appear in Angola, which snagged the rapper one of his largest paydays for a concert to date: $1.4 million. ""The money had to play a factor in getting an artist of his stature at that time to go over there, but there were other things that we did,"" Rajkumar said of booking 50 Cent for the Angola concert. ""We tied in a visit to the embassy and did a huge AIDS awareness event with a bunch of kids, as well as a hospital and orphanage donation, so there was also an element of giving back to the country."" Fans in the United States and major countries in Europe have better access to concerts by some of their favorite acts, Rajkumar said, but the presence of these same stars in some of the smaller and more far-flung countries generates a great deal of interest that artists can cash in on. Oil companies, cell phone companies and breweries are usually the three big types of industries that sponsor such shows, as well as local governments, which want to put their country on the map and stimulate tourism. When rapper Snoop Dogg performed in Croatia in 2008, he packed Zagreb's Dom Sportova arena with 10,000 fans, and the event made the style section of the Croatia Tourist Center website. But the shows aren't cheap to produce, with the need for increased security and the fees paid both to the artist and for expenses like flying in the artist's entourage and equipment needed to mount a concert. ""These events are hardly ever put on for the financial benefit,"" said Rajkumar, who added that often, fans in these countries cannot afford expensive tickets. ""It's more for the exposure and publicity it generates."" Such appearances can also expand artists' fan bases and their wallets. Peter Katsis, a music manager and a senior vice president of music for Prospect Park Entertainment, recently told CNN that the temptation is absolutely there for artists to ""just take the check."" ""The attraction is obviously the money,"" said Katsis, who has worked with such performers as the Backstreet Boys, Jane's Addiction and Korn. ""You can sometimes make as much as you can in a week on tour by doing one show."" But Katsis said the recent scandal has some artists thinking twice about where they book their shows. ""I think in light of the current situation, people are going to be asking more questions than ever before,"" he said. Marketing expert Rachel Weingarten said the celebrities are smart to donate the money to charity, though they may want to also consider ways to educate people about world issues and dictatorships. Such scandals can make consumers feel very uncomfortable, she said. ""It's someone who is a pop star right now, and you're thinking, 'Wait a minute, I'm downloading their music, going to see their concert and supporting them, when a year or so ago, they were performing for a dictator.' It puts [the fan] in the equation,"" Weingarten said. ""It suddenly makes people have to question their own politics if they are supporting someone who took this check."" Rajkumar said his company does massive amounts of due diligence, including flying into the country to meet with the key players, checking the source of wire transfers and meeting with representatives from the U.S. embassy there to make sure that there are no concerns about money being funneled out of the country. ""We have to track and do the research that the government that's in place is legitimate,"" he said. ""We talk to the embassy and check out political contacts to make sure our government doesn't have information that the country is being run by a dictator or that funds are being directed out of the country for the leader's benefit."" It is so easy to fall prey to a bad deal, he said, with the use of middlemen and others who may not be very scrupulous. ""You just know that any money coming out of the country is coming from Gadhafi, because he controls the wealth there,"" Rajkumar said. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Several pop stars have come under fire for performing for the family of Libyan dictator .

"(CNN) -- The future of Europe may rest on whether NATO can recover its roots. With Russian President Vladimir Putin ""land grabbing"" and violating international law, the alliance is finding itself ""brought back to its core,"" says Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, NATO's former secretary general. But it isn't prepared. When NATO was founded in 1949, its central task was to protect its members against military aggression and work to promote democracy -- which, in the years following, often meant standing against the Soviet empire. The alliance declares success in achieving that goal peacefully, saying on its website that ""throughout the entire period of the Cold War, NATO forces were not involved in a single military engagement."" But things changed after the Cold War. The focus was no longer on Russia. NATO says ""new threats"" emerged. The alliance got involved militarily in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s, and later in Macedonia. It established a military force in Afghanistan, and has forces in Somalia and some other parts of Africa. Now, Russia is increasing its reach, and getting close to NATO terrain. It annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March and is accused of sending its troops into eastern Ukraine in support of pro-Russian rebels, a claim that Moscow denies. So, 55 years into its existence, NATO finds itself, as the Financial Times put it, going ""back to the future."" Just how to do that is a central question as the alliance convenes its summit in Wales. ""The problem NATO has is it's not fully ready to be able to protect its own members,"" Robin Niblett, director of the think tank Chatham House, told CNN. NATO's military preparedness is ""paltry compared to the kinds of steps the Russians are taking."" NATO wants each of its 28 member nations to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense. While the United States and Britain meet the target, 24 member nations don't. There has been a ""sort of cozy mentality that the Cold War has gone and we can focus just on domestic investment,"" Niblett says. Obama, Cameron: Spend more on military . U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron said they ""believe that NATO can adapt to meet the new challenges."" In a joint Op-Ed in the Times of London Thursday, the two men wrote, ""The changes we need are clear. With Russia trying to force a sovereign state to abandon its right to democracy at the barrel of a gun, we should support Ukraine's right to determine its own democratic future and continue our efforts to enhance Ukrainian capabilities."" The military should ""ensure a persistent presence in eastern Europe,"" they said. The two leaders also called for a ""multinational rapid response force, composed of land, air, maritime and special forces, that could deploy anywhere in the world at very short notice."" In addition, they urged all NATO nations to meet the 2% target for defense spending. But some countries, including Germany, are resistant to do so -- ""not only because of the weak European economy but also not to aggravate the crisis with Russia over Ukraine any further,"" the Soufan Group, which tracks security threats, said in a briefing Thursday. Still, Ukraine has sought NATO's help in the crisis. And while the country is not a member of the alliance, ""its new leaders seek eventual membership"" -- a move that angers Putin, the briefing noted. Analyst: It's the West's fault . John Mearsheimer, political science professor with the University of Chicago, argues that it's actually NATO's expansion that set Russia off. ""The United States and its European allies share most of the responsibility for the crisis. The taproot of the trouble is NATO enlargement, the central element of a larger strategy to move Ukraine out of Russia's orbit and integrate it into the West,"" he wrote in Foreign Affairs. ""At the same time, the EU's expansion eastward and the West's backing of the pro-democracy movement in Ukraine... were critical elements, too."" Obama and Cameron disagree. ""Russia has ripped up the rulebook with its illegal, self-declared annexation of Crimea and its troops on Ukrainian soil threatening a sovereign nation state,"" they wrote in their Op-Ed. 'Pivotal moment' As the summit convenes in Wales, ""the United States, NATO, and free nations around the world confront a pivotal moment of truth,"" says Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire. ""By now, it should be clear to all objective observers that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not impressed by starkly worded statements and declarations, and if that is the only outcome in Wales, it could represent a historic failure of the alliance at a time when NATO's foundational purpose has renewed relevance,"" Ayotte wrote in a column for CNN.com. The changes NATO needs to make are possible, says James Stavridis, a former Navy admiral who now serves as dean of The Fletcher School at Tufts University. ""The capacity is there. It's a matter of re-gearing and doing... rotational deployments into bases in the east."" ""We'll have to exercise much more frequently,"" the former NATO secretary general, Scheffer, says of the alliance's troops. ""We'll have to bring forces on the ground in Poland and in the Baltic region to show Vladimir Putin that NATO means serious business."" As NATO holds its summit in Wales, talk of an action plan is front and center. Part of that means a focus on money. ""More important than the amount spent is where it's spent,"" says Niblett. ""Not enough is being spent on new equipment, modernized capabilities -- new capability surveillance, precision munitions, aircraft defenses."" Still, even if NATO undergoes a makeover to confront Russia, experts agree: Wresting all of Ukraine back from Putin's grip is a very long shot. Leaders hold pivotal NATO summit as threats of ISIS, Russian aggression loom . NATO: What should we expect?","After NATO's founding, it stood against Russia .

"Bethesda, Maryland (CNN) -- When Capt. Greg Galeazzi joined the Army seven years ago, he was well aware of the risks he would face. ""Of course you accept that injuries or death is a possibility,"" Galeazzi said. ""This is what happens to soldiers who fight wars."" In 2011, that possibility became Galeazzi's reality. While leading his platoon on a routine morning patrol, an improvised explosive device detonated beneath him. ""It felt like I got hit by a wrecking ball,"" he said. Though Galeazzi survived the blast, life as he knew it did not. Suddenly, he was a double, above the knee amputee and had a severely wounded right arm. ""I was a shell of a man,"" he said. ""Who I was, was gone."" Before his injuries, playing the guitar had been a special pastime for Galeazzi. ""Music has always been important to me,"" he said. ""I felt a deep sadness because I thought I'd lost my ability to play music."" Galeazzi began to see things differently when he joined MusiCorps, a music rehabilitation program for severely wounded soldiers who are recovering at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. ""We match the injured troops with professional musicians,"" said Arthur Bloom, who founded the program in 2007. ""They help wounded warriors play music and recover their lives."" 'Band' of brothers . Bloom, a graduate of the Yale School of Music, offers his services to patients at Walter Reed who have an interest in playing an instrument. Program participants practice technique. They write and record music. Or they may just get together for a jam session. ""Some of what we do you could call adaptive music making,"" Bloom said. ""The folks who are missing limbs or have damaged hands and arms sometimes require specialized instruments, which we provide."" VOTE for the CNN Hero of the Year . The journey to recovery for many troops is a long one. It can require dozens of surgeries and many years spent in medical treatment facilities. ""There's so much downtime at Walter Reed, and that's what we fill up with music,"" Bloom said. ""What we didn't expect is that they'd get really, really good. So we formed a band."" The MusiCorps Wounded Warrior Band is the performance component of Bloom's program. The group has performed at some of the country's premiere concert venues, including the Kennedy Center and Madison Square Garden, and with world-renowned musicians like Yo-Yo Ma and Roger Waters. ""When I see them perform, it just blows me away,"" Bloom said. ""They're amazing even when they don't perform. But performing shows other people -- and it also shows them -- that they're amazing."" Rock 'n' recover . Studies show that music can reduce anxiety and even help an injured brain heal. Bloom believes that music is medicine for the mind. ""I've seen guys come in here, and they're going through such a tough time with their injuries that they are very withdrawn,"" Bloom said. ""The music becomes their new way of communicating. It can be just as powerful as the spoken word. ... By injecting music into this space, we can inject life."" Since 2007, Bloom and his group have helped hundreds of wounded warriors. For Galeazzi, joining MusiCorps has helped restore his confidence and made him more optimistic about his future. In addition to rediscovering his musical ability, he is currently enrolled in pre-med classes. ""Something survived that horrible injury in Afghanistan,"" Galeazzi said. ""And that was my ability to play the guitar. Arthur and his program changed my outlook on what is possible."" Bloom says the greatest reward has been working with the troop of amazingly talented individuals. ""Music has no stigma,"" he said. ""The folks we work with, when they do music, there's nothing injured about the way they do it. It's just good music."" Want to get involved?

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- A plane carrying 20 people crashed on takeoff from Nigeria's Murtala Muhammed Airport in Lagos on Thursday, killing 14, the nation's aviation minister said. ""The six survivors were promptly transported to the hospital and are receiving appropriate medical care,"" Princess Stella Oduah-Ogiemwonyi said in a statement on her Facebook page. Two of the injured were in critical condition, and four were in stable condition, said her spokesman, Joe Obi, on her Facebook page. The incident occurred at 9:32 a.m. when an Embraer 120 operated by Associated Airlines on a private charter flight to Akure crashed shortly after takeoff from the airport's domestic wing and burst into flames, she said. First responders reached the crash site and extinguished the fire within two minutes, ""despite the surging crowd,"" she said. The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder have both been recovered from the wreckage, said Muhtar Usman, commissioner with the Nigerian Accident Investigation Bureau. The identities of the victims were being withheld pending notification of relatives, Oduah-Ogiemwony said. Among the passengers were relatives of the late former governor of Ondo state, Olusegun Agagu, who were accompanying his body on the flight, Nigerian state-run TV broadcaster NTA reported. Agagu was a former aviation minister in Nigeria. In a statement from an adviser, President Goodluck Jonathan extended his condolences to relatives of the dead. ""President Jonathan views the plane crash as most unfortunate and regrettable, given the concerted efforts of the federal government to enhance aviation safety in the country,"" said the spokesman, Reuben Abati. ""He has therefore ordered a thorough investigation of the crash by all relevant agencies with a view to determining the cause and taking further actions, as may become necessary.""

"Editor's note: Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado, the first openly gay man elected to the House as a freshman, is one of the subjects of the CNN.com series ""Freshman Year,"" in which Polis and new Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, provide firsthand reports of political life. Here, Polis' partner, Marlon Reis, talks about the challenges and coping strategies of his own freshman year as a ""congressional spouse"" not usually encountered in Washington. Marlon Reis, left, and Rep. Jared Polis talk. Reis says he has had difficulties as a ""congressional spouse."" WASHINGTON (CNN) -- One of my heroes growing up was Jackie Robinson. My mom, an ardent baseball fan from whom I got my love of the game, had an old baseball card of his from the 1950s and told us his amazing story of courage in integrating baseball. Years later, I read of the difficulty he faced as the first African-American major league baseball player -- people sliding in with their spikes up, pitchers beaning him, teammates shunning him. Fortunately, the rapid pace of social progress has made it easier to break barriers than ever before, and although Congress is still far from representative of the population as a whole, the 111th Congress has record numbers of gay members, members of ethnic minorities and women. My partner, Marlon Reis, and I have been together for more than six years. We never saw ourselves or our relationship as anything different from those of other members of Congress, and while notable, the gender of my spouse has little to do with the overall experience of the congressional life and our ""freshman year."" The life of a congressional spouse is harder than the life of the member. They do all the work and get none of the recognition. Fortunately, Marlon's passion for writing fiction is consistent with the necessary mobility of the congressional lifestyle and being able to work out of two homes. I am proud that Marlon has chosen to tell his tale. Marlon Reis: To be a congressional spouse, one must be, above all else, flexible. So I was told when I arrived in D.C. 10 months ago. At the time of my introduction, I was something of a novelty among the spouses. At 28 years old, I was one of the youngest spouses in the U.S. Congress. Jared is the second-youngest congressman. Almost immediately, I was mistaken for a staff aide; then again, for a son designated to attend in place of a spouse. More times than I care to remember, I was told, ""But you're so young!"" Rarely has anyone seen me for what I actually am. I don my ""Congressional Spouse"" lapel pin proudly and hope each time not to be questioned, yet I still receive sideways glances and orders to produce an official ID. It is as if my story is too unbelievable to be true, that I am an interloper, someone in a place I do not belong. Perhaps this has to do with my being the partner of the first openly gay man to win a seat as a nonincumbent. I have noticed among those I meet a tincture of incredulity; a reluctance to accept that which has not been seen before. Washington is a place steeped in traditions, some fine, others deplorable. Both my partner and I, in many ways, are a challenge to the outdated notions that have reigned for so long. And just like those who arrive uninvited, from time to time, our experiences highlight differences rather than similarities. Sometimes we are welcome; other times, our presence seems to inspire resentment and tension. Even among a group that is known for the unusual lifestyle of its members, ours seems to stand out. And yet, we are very much the same as any congressional family. We take time, when we have it, to enjoy dinners together, to play video games, to walk our new puppy and to celebrate life's happy moments. Like any couple working to make things right, we check in with each other to be sure it all hasn't gotten to be too much. Always on planes back and forth, contending often with feelings of displacement, we have our challenges. But still, there is a great deal to love in being an elected family. It is true that flexibility is the main ingredient in a successful congressional life. In many ways, we sacrifice what was once private for that which is, at times, painfully public. As much as we speak on behalf of our constituents, we are also a voice for the concerns of our LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] community and democracy and freedom. I am excited to be here with Jared on the front lines, making history and fighting the good fight. It fills me again with hope when I remember that we are only the first in what will be a long line of openly LGBT legislators; people who come to serve our country rightfully and with the respect they deserve. Each time we encounter injustice is an opportunity to be uncompromising, to prove a point, to not back down, but to pave the way. When, on the basis of our same-sex relationship, the military attempted to bar me from accompanying Jared on a congressional delegation to Seattle, we fought and I triumphantly took my seat alongside the other spouses. When I was told by Member Services that my lost ID should never have read ""spouse,"" that the government recognizes me only as a ""designee,"" I prepared to fight -- but then found the original card. Doubtless, these are but the opening acts of a years-long play about justice and the steady march of progress. For this, and for all we have to look forward to, I thank our constituents for the chance to change the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jared Polis and Marlon Reis.","Lawmaker's partner talks about challenge of being accepted as a spouse in D.C.

"(CNN) -- Exotic food is part of the global travel experience. But recent efforts by conservation groups to ban the much-loved deep fried shark sandwich in Trinidad and Tobago have proved these experiences are often fraught with cultural difficulties, especially for travelers who like to experiment with new experiences. Here are some of the more exotic food items travelers might encounter, along with reasons some say you should avoid them. Ortolan (France) The ortolan is a songbird found throughout Europe. In France, home to one of the largest populations, it's a delicacy traditionally consumed beneath a napkin, because it's eaten whole, the entire creature devoured in one mouthful. The dish featured in the latest ""Hannibal"" TV series. Poachers illegally kill thousands every year and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that the species has declined by 30% over the past decade. ""The population has declined steadily due to illegal hunting purely to satisfy epicurean appetites,"" says Professor Stanley Temple, a conservation expert at the University of Wisconsin. ""We have a terrible history of decimating birds like the ortolan, which are hunted solely for illicit profit."" Shark fin (China) ""One quarter of species of shark are at risk of extinction and demand for fins is a substantial component of this threat,"" says Professor Michael McCarthy, a conservationist at the University of Melbourne. You're mostly likely to come across shark fin soup in China, where the expensive dish is traditionally served at weddings, or to welcome guests and to show respect at other formal occasions. In Asia, consumption of shark fins and meat is legal, and Taiwan is the only Asian country to ban the controversial practice of finning, which involves removing the shark's fin and discarding the rest of the carcass at sea. Recently some airlines and hotels in Hong Kong removed shark fin from their menus in response to the controversy and China banned the serving of shark fin at official government banquets. Green sea turtle (Cayman Islands) Travelers are most likely to find green sea turtle meat in the Cayman Islands (where it's regarded as a national dish and legal to consume and breed the species), throughout the Caribbean, Asia and some of the U.S. southern states, although it's illegal to import, sell, or transport the species in the United States. Diminishing numbers and the widely condemned breeding conditions found at the world's only legal breeding facility in the Cayman Islands mean travelers should avoid this dish, according to some. ""Whilst some local communities may depend on turtle meat for subsistence and cultural reasons, there's no need for travelers or tourists to eat this endangered animal,"" points out Elise Neve at the World Society for the Protection of Animals. Pangolin (China) If you're keen to impress friends with tales of exotic foods the pangolin might tick the box, but increased demand has wreaked havoc for the creature, despite its unappetizing appearance. You're most likely to find a plateful of pangolin in China, where it's now illegal to hunt the animal. The pangolins' secretive, solitary and nocturnal habits have made it hard to estimate numbers, although records point to a sharp decrease. 7 ways to save the pangolin . ""Pangolins look like armor-plated lizards, but are shy, nocturnal mammals,"" explains Simon Pope, director of campaigns and communications at World Society for the Protection of Animals. ""The wildlife trade network TRAFFIC has reported that the insatiable demand for pangolin meat has decimated populations and demand from China is now seeing pangolins in Africa being hunted for the Asian restaurant market."" Western long-beaked echidna (Papua New Guinea) The Western long-beaked echidna's native home is New Guinea, but the threat of extinction looms large due to hunting for human consumption. It's one of only two species of mammal to lay eggs (the other is the platypus), and is key to understanding mammalian evolution. The Papua New Guinean government has banned commercial hunting but traditional hunting with dogs is permitted. They're now incredibly rare in New Guinea, but breeding programs carried out by zoos in other countries are going some way to safeguard the species' future. Mountain chicken/giant ditch frog (Dominica, Montserrat) This super-sized amphibian may not look too appealing as a delicacy, but its popularity in the Caribbean has seen the population decline by 80% over the past decade. The meat regularly appears on restaurant menus, although it's now only found on Dominica and Montserrat. The IUCN, which lists the species as critically endangered, says up to 36,000 were being killed every year as recently as 2002, and estimates there are now just 8,000 remaining. Gorilla (Republic of the Congo) Gorillas have been pushed to the brink of extinction due to their popularity as bushmeat. In cities such as Pointe Noire in the Republic of the Congo, smoked gorilla meat is sold openly (but illegally) at markets. It's believed that more than 400 gorillas are killed for bushmeat every year, despite the fact that the species is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. The species' low productive rates mean that even low levels of hunting have a devastating effect on populations. Chinese giant salamander (China) Chinese giant salamanders are the largest species of amphibian and live in lakes and rivers in southern China. Over the past 30 years, over-harvesting for the food trade -- they sell for $1,000 a piece -- has seen an 80% decline in numbers, and it's now classed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Over-harvesting hasn't just threatened its survival but stunted its growth -- scientists believe that hunters' preference for larger salamanders is the reason they no longer grow beyond six feet in length. ""Chinese giant salamander should always be avoided,"" says Claire Christian at the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition. ""This species has declined to extremely low levels."" Dolphin (Japan, Taiwan) Sale of dolphin meat for consumption is common and legal in Japan, although it's often mislabeled and sold as whale meat, which sells for much more. Although the way in which the dolphins are killed is controversial, most notably as highlighted by the movie ""The Cove,"" none of the species being hunted in Japan are listed as endangered. In Taiwan, the catching, selling and consumption of dolphin meat was banned in 1989. Despite this, 1,000 dolphins are caught illegally there every year and dolphin fishcakes are often sold openly at street food stalls, especially in Western Taiwan.","Shark fin still consumed regularly in China, though hotels and airlines have recently removed the dish from menus .

"(CNN) -- Training for a race is like riding a roller coaster -- you experience highs and lows, ups and downs, and more peaks and troughs than the New York Stock Exchange. Two weeks before I raced at the World Ironman Championships in Kona, Hawaii, last year, I had a bad bike crash. I won the race, not on physical prowess, but on grit, willpower, determination and mental strength. I hope I showed, through my performance there, that sporting success rests, in part, with having the mental fortitude necessary to overcome our fears, pain and discomfort. But how does one develop that strength? Is it innate, or can it be learned? I believe it is the latter. We can all train our brains to be as strong as our bodies. It sounds simple, but it's so easy to forget. If we let our head drop, our heart drops with it. Keep your head up, and your body is capable of amazing feats. To plunder the words of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, ""Don't ever forget that you play with your soul as well as your body."" Follow the Fit Nation team on Twitter or on Facebook . The message is this: All the physical strength in the world won't help you if your mind is not prepared. This is part of training for a race -- the part that people don't put in their logbooks, the part that all the monitors, gizmos and gadgets in the world can't influence. But how do you train your brain to help you achieve your goals? I don't profess to have all, or many, of the answers. But in the five years that I have been a professional triathlete, I have learned a few techniques that help me keep mind over matter and ensure that I can ride the roller coaster of sporting success: . Have a mantra and/or a special song to repeat . I write my mantra on my water bottle and on my race wristband. Seeing it gives me a boost and reminds me never to let my head or heart drop. If you use a permanent marker, be prepared for the wording to stay there long after the race has ended (and that you might receive strange looks from colleagues when you return to work with ""I am as strong as an ox"" tattooed on your arm). I also carry a dog-eared copy of Rudyard Kipling's famous poem ""If"" everywhere I go. I believe the lines of this poem encapsulate the qualities necessary to become a successful athlete and a well-rounded person. Reading it before a race gives me the confidence to pursue my dreams. Keep a bank of positive mental images . These images can be of family and friends, of previous races, of beautiful scenery, or a big greasy burger. Draw on these images throughout the race, and especially if you feel the ""I am tired. I want to stop. Why did I enter this race? I must be mad"" doubts creeping into your mind. Deliver these negative thoughts a knockout punch before they have the chance to grow and become the mental monster that derails your entire race. Practice visualization beforehand . In training, when traveling, while sleeping or at work, this is the simple act of closing your eyes (although I don't recommend doing this at a work meeting or while on your bike). Relax your mind and go through each stage of the race one step at a time -- mentally imagining yourself performing at your peak but also successfully overcoming potential problems. Before Michael Phelps has even entered the water, he has already completed the race in his mind. And won. You can draw on the visual images (the finish line), the feelings you experience (energy surges) or the sounds you hear (roars of the crowd). That way when you race, you have the peace of mind and confidence that you have already conquered the challenges. Break the race up into smaller, more manageable segments . I always think of the marathon as four 10 kilometer races with a little bit more at the end. You might think only about getting to the next aid station, or lamppost or Porta Potty and, from there, set another landmark goal. Stay in the moment and don't think too far ahead. I also try to breathe deeply and rhythmically; if you calm your breath, you can help calm your mind. Remember that training is about learning to hurt . Push your physical limits and overcome them in training sessions, so that when you race you know that you have successfully endured pain and discomfort. You will draw confidence and peace of mind from this knowledge. Get people to support you . Some people thrive on the support from their family and friends, while others perceive it as added pressure. Work out what feels right for you, and if necessary, invite friends, family or pets to come and cheer you on. Have them make banners, wear team T-shirts and generally behave in a way that would get them arrested under normal circumstances. Mentally recall inspirational people . I recall people who have all fought against adversity to complete the Ironman. These people prove that anything truly is possible. You might want to consider dedicating each mile to a special person in your life. That makes the discomfort easier to bear and will help give you a mental and physical boost. Consider racing for a cause that is bigger than yourself . For me, it is to establish a platform on which to spread important messages and be a patron for charitable causes. These force me to put the race in perspective and rise to greater heights. Champions come and go, but to me the real judge of my personal success will be whether I actually do something positive with the opportunities I have been given. I really hope that, as four-time world champion, I can be a role model and ambassador for the sport that everyone can be proud of. I hope that these tips provide some of that sporting gold dust, and enable you to have the race you have always dreamed of. We will all continue to endure the downs and the dark times, but remember that it is overcoming these that makes the success all the more sweeter. In the words of the great Muhammad Ali: ""Success is not achieved by winning all the time. Real success comes when we rise after we fall. Some mountains are higher than others. Some roads steeper than the next. There are hardships and setbacks but you cannot let them stop you. Even on the steepest road you must not turn back"". You might not always have the perfect day, but with the right mental training hopefully the roller-coaster ride will be one to remember. Just remember to celebrate with that huge plate of greasy burger! Good luck!

"Washington (CNN) -- A new political ad against Republican Scott Brown could easily have been an attack ad against Mitt Romney in 2012. One of the toughest spots to hit Brown this cycle, the 30-second ad paints the former senator from Massachusetts as a ""yes man"" to a large corporation that has outsourced jobs. While the ad never mentions Romney, who campaigned for Brown this summer, the outsourcing attack was a key strategy used by Democrats two years ago when Romney, a former private equity executive, was running for president. In the ad, released by Senate Majority PAC, the Democratic group highlights Brown's ties with Kadant, a Massachusetts paper company that named Brown to its board of directors last year. Brown was ousted from Congress in 2012, but he's now fighting to reclaim a spot in the Senate, this time from New Hampshire where he's challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. A $500,000 ad buy, the spot starts airing Tuesday on cable and broadcast and will run for two weeks. It's the group's fifth ad against Brown this cycle and comes as the Republican is in a dead heat with Shaheen, according to a new CNN/ORC International poll. New Hampshire Republicans have made their own outsourcing attacks against Shaheen. They point out that when she was governor of New Hampshire, part of the state's food stamp program was outsourced to India. Elizabeth Guyton, communications director for Brown's campaign, says the attack ad shows that ""Shaheen is getting desperate"" and ""her D.C.-based special interest group allies have resorted to attacking Scott Brown with negative and false ads.""","A Democratic group is releasing a tough new ad on Scott Brown .

"(CNN) -- After 25 years, Robin Thomas had just about lost hope. Her brother, Jim Wolf, suffers from depression, alcoholism, unresolved grief and chronic homelessness, she says. No one disputes Wolf has been arrested dozens and dozens of times, mostly for misdemeanors such as public intoxication. Thomas says her brother ""lives in survival mode"" and nearly died after an altercation with a bouncer left him with a crushed sternum and broken foot, she says. Recently, Wolf was featured in a fundraising video created by Rob Bliss for Dégagé Ministries. The group provides shelter, meals and other services daily to more than 400 homeless people in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Wolf is one of their regular clients. The video features Wolf getting a makeover that included a haircut with highlights, beard grooming and a beautiful new suit. The video received more than 14 million views in just a few weeks and helped raise more than $30,000 for Dégagé Ministries. Bliss says his hope was for the makeover to provide a start down a new path. Thomas says Wolf has started on that path before. ""It's our hope he'll take steps,"" Thomas says. ""The makeover took a couple of hours. He's had alcoholism for 25 years."" Wolf joined the U.S. Army at age 18 and spent a few years in the National Guard. Thomas says Wolf trained to deploy with an infantry unit but never deployed. She doesn't know exactly how many years he served. The nation's homeless veterans are predominantly male, according the Department of Veterans Affairs. The majority are single, live in urban areas and suffer from mental illness, alcohol and/or substance abuse, or co-occurring disorders. About 13% of the adult homeless population are veterans. Thomas says Wolf never saw combat; she suspects the life event that continues to haunt him was the sudden death of their mother. But that, his sister says, was years ago. Neither Thomas nor Bliss seemed surprised or anxious when Wolf was arrested shortly after the video was released. That Wolf is drinking but not using drugs is something of a relief. ""If he gets arrested fewer times this year than last, that's progress,"" Bliss says. Thomas agrees. She doesn't take responsibility for Wolf or make excuses for him. When speaking of her brother, she seems quiet, respectful and a bit sad. She knows he is not the same big brother who was there for her growing up. She doesn't question why her three other brothers have been less involved in helping Wolf than she is. She says Wolf is a great guy, has always been a great guy, but he's never dealt with the reality of the havoc he's created. Since the video was posted, people have shown willingness to help in various ways, Bliss and Thomas say. Dentists, rehabilitation facilities and doctors have offered assistance. Wolf was recently interviewed for a spot at a long-term residential treatment facility and received a complete physical, Thomas said. This week, he visited the hairstylist who cut his hair in the video for a trim. ""He shows people his picture in the paper,"" Thomas says. ""He's always sought attention, whether it's by telling a joke or leaving a cabinet door open while passing through the kitchen."" She knows all these things are good things. She also admits that perhaps the video did not give Wolf the ""glimpse into the future"" that others had hoped. He did not view it as a life-changing event, Thomas says. Walking into Dégagé Ministries this week, Thomas says, she had the sudden realization that the day center held ""300 Jims."" ""My hope for him is to get clean and sober,"" she said, ""then get help with his depression. And for him to gain back hopefulness. I think he's hopeless. I don't think he can see the trees through the forest."" As for the rest of us who will click on the video, then later in the day walk by a man or woman holding a sign, or huddling in a cardboard box, Thomas hopes we will be willing to extend a hand of support instead of a dollar bill. ""Volunteer to give them some purpose. Talk to them. Have a simple conversation,"" she said.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Several thousand Kenyans attended a rally Monday for two prominent politicians who have been implicated in crimes against humanity and brought before the International Criminal Court at The Hague, Netherlands. Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta and member of Parliament William Ruto had just returned from the court, where they face multiple counts of crimes against humanity for the bloody post-election violence that wracked Kenya in late 2007 and early 2008. ""We are prepared to carry this cross,"" Ruto said. ""We are determined never again that Kenyans will fight over polls."" The rally was billed as a prayer meeting, but it took the form of a political event, with dozens of members of Parliament from across the country showing their support for the embattled officials. Speakers at the rally in Nairobi's Uhuru Park repeatedly blamed the International Criminal Court case on politics and Western meddling. But chief prosecutor at The Hague, Louis Moreno Ocampo, took the brunt of the criticism. Ocampo has repeatedly denied that the case is political in any way. The post-election violence occurred after a disputed election in December 2007. More than a thousand people were killed, the majority by security forces, and hundreds of thousands were displaced from their homes. Local media reported that en route from the airport to Uhuru Park, the convoy holding the politicians was stoned by frustrated youth. Despite the political pleas for support, many Kenyans support the Hague process and at least one major broadcaster refused to show the rally live, as is customary by news broadcasters in Kenya. Kenyatta is the son of the iconic founder of modern Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, the nation's first president. In addition to him and Ruto, the former agriculture minister, four others also are accused of organizing the post-election violence. They are Cabinet Secretary Francis Muthaura, former national police Chief Hussein Ali, opposition leader Henry Kosgey and radio journalist Joshua Arap Sang. The chaos and violence after the 2007 election escalated into ethnic violence pitting supporters of incumbent President Mwai Kibaki against those of challenger Raila Odinga, who was later named prime minister in a power-sharing agreement. Muthaura, Kenyatta and Ali are accused of committing or contributing to the killing, rape and other acts of violence against supporters of Odinga's opposition Orange Democratic Movement. The International Criminal Court set a September 21 date to hear arguments as to whether they should go to trial. Ruto, Sang and Kosgey are accused of being involved in the murder, deportation and commission of other offenses against supporters of Kenya's Party of National Unity. The court set a September 1 date for their arguments. Ekaterina Trendafilova, the presiding judge, said if more crimes are committed, the court could replace summonses with arrest warrants. ""It came to the knowledge of the chamber through following some articles in the Kenyan newspapers that there are movements toward retriggering the violence in Kenya, by way of delivering dangerous speeches,"" the judge said. Kenya has challenged the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, saying its own authorities will investigate and prosecute the cases on Kenyan soil. The Netherlands-based court calls itself, on its website, ""an independent international organization ... established to help end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community.""","Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto have just returned from The Hague .

"(CNN) -- ""Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin."" -- Mother Teresa . Maybe it was because my parents were immigrants, who scraped by most of their lives and were always forced to plan for tomorrow. Maybe it was because some of the scars from their past were too painful, and they felt those moments should be forgotten. It could be they felt their lives were moving so quickly that if they spent much time in the past, they would lose out on their future. No matter what the reason, when I told my parents we were going on a journey to the other side of the world to find our roots, they were a little skeptical. Sure, a family medical history was important to know, but learning about our ancestors' lives? They weren't all that interested. In many ways, they believed that visiting the past would be, at best, a luxury. At worst, it would be a complete waste of time. They would be the first to tell you now it was a wonderfully transformative experience that brought three generations of our family closer together. As much as I thought I knew the story of my family, I really only had a few headlines. I didn't know the nuances, the details, the tidbits that painted a more complete picture of who we really are. I didn't know that my dad's great-uncle was a freedom fighter who was jailed twice for speaking truth to power. I didn't know that my great-grandfather gave away all his money and land (and a herd of buffalo) to the priests in the north Indian community where he lived with his wife and five sons. Even 100 years later, they describe him as the most charitable person who ever lived in that small town. I didn't know that at 6 feet 4 inches, he was able to jump over a water buffalo in one leap. I didn't know when my mom fled as a 5-year-old refugee from the bloody partition in 1947, that her Hindu relatives all disguised themselves in the traditional garb of Muslims to blend in and ensure their safety. I saw that scared little girl in my mind and better understood the remarkably resilient woman who grew up to be my mother. At one point during our trip, she turned to her three granddaughters and said, ""I am proof that anything is possible."" To understand truly where you are going, it helps to understand from where you came. There are so many moments from our journey that I will never forget. There was the camel ride on Karachi beach in Pakistan with my mom. For the first time, she shared some of the awful details of her life as a refugee. That beach was the last place she saw before leaving the war-torn country. She never imagined returning. Another moment involved ancient scrolls that date back 40 generations. My father's side of the family had its history recorded going back nearly 1,000 years -- and the look on my father's face when he saw the scrolls for the first time will forever be seared in my mind. I will never forget the questions my daughters started asking -- not just the names of their ancestors, but what kind of people were they, really? I can now honestly answer some of those questions. I can tell them the extraordinary story of how their grandparents met. It's a tale that will inspire faith even in the most cynical of people. Even today, many Indians still have arranged marriages. But in the mid-1960s, my parents, two young college students, started a romance in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and fell in love. ""Then you happened,"" my dad told me with a smile as we stood in the exact spot they first met. If you are reading this, you're probably already interested in the idea of finding your roots. Here is what I've learned: . While the journey was life-altering, I will most remember the conversations we had along the way. There is something about finding your roots that fosters and nurtures family discussions that you would not otherwise have had. Mother Teresa was right: Yesterday is gone. But I learned, along with my family, that it is very worthwhile to pay a visit every now and then.","Dr. Sanjay Gupta traveled from Pakistan to Michigan to discover his family's roots .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Late 90s Beijing. Those were the days. Forgive the wistful opening but it's true. The saccharine pop hit ""Xin Tai Ruan"" may have played endlessly on the radio and the ""Titanic"" screensaver displayed on virtually every cubicle PC, but I forgive the kitsch of that era. It was a time before China became a top destination for resume-wielding MBAs. And it was a time of intellectual exchange between curious locals and sinophile expats, each drawn by a strong mutual interest in culture, music, and emerging technology. In circa 1997 Beijing, there was no relentless gridlock or constant smartphone use to prevent free and open exploration in the real world. And there were only 620,000 Internet users across the entire country. This was the dawn of dot-coms in China. Cigarettes and instant noodles . When I couldn't land my dream job as a full-time reporter in Beijing, I took up a post with a fledgling Chinese Internet firm I had covered as a freelancer. That start-up would later grow into Sohu, one of China's leading Internet companies. Its original one-room office in the Bright China Chang An Building was spartan to say the least. Forget the gourmet canteens of Baidu today. Seventeen years ago, the dotcom diet in Beijing was MSG-laced instant noodles and cigarettes at your desk. I was the only Western woman in the company and one of a few thousand Western expats in the city. If you were an expat in pre-World Trade Organization China, you were probably there because of a genuine interest in the country and its culture. We weren't there to exploit the economic opportunity of a so-called rising China. We were just there for an adventure. Dotcom game . In 1999, I met fellow American expat Porter Erisman for dinner while he was leading the Internet marketing group at Ogilvy & Mather in Beijing. He was curious about jumping into the China dotcom game and wanted to know more about what it was like. I recently caught up with Porter to reminisce about that time and learn more about why he decided to take that risk and join a Chinese Internet start-up. ""I had a number of clients who had different Internet start-ups and they all looked like they were having such a great time, so I wanted to join in and be part of it,"" he tells me. ""I met with different managers of different companies, and the one I finally felt comfortable with was Alibaba just because they had a very international mindset."" Porter joined Alibaba.com in April 2000 and for the next eight years worked as a vice president in charge of the company's international website operations, marketing and corporate affairs. He witnessed Alibaba's rise from a tiny start-up running out of a small apartment to a global Internet giant. And even though he left his post there a few years back, Porter is thrilled for the company as it goes to market with its blockbuster IPO. ""For me, there's some satisfaction in seeing that the company I played a role in building in the early days has grown to become possibly the world's largest e-commerce company,"" he says. Porter left Alibaba to become a consultant and filmmaker. In his documentary film, ""Crocodile in the Yangtze,"" he tells the story of Alibaba's struggle in its early years and eventual triumph over eBay in China. Far from over . I too left my Chinese dotcom to become a storyteller of sorts. Over the years, I've shared my experiences in China's nascent IT industry and ventured into journalism. Seventeen years ago in Beijing, there were riveting debates in tea houses and over hot pot dinners. It's since been forced into the open in a very big way thanks to the rise of social media and mobile messaging now reaching more than 600 million Chinese. As a journalist, the tension and the opportunity of China's now mammoth dotcoms has been a thrill to both witness and report. And the story is far from over.","CNN's Kristie Lu Stout worked for Sohu, a Chinese tech start-up, in the 1990s .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ready for Hillary, the super PAC urging Hillary Clinton to run for president in 2016, raised over $2 million and had 21,000 new donors in the last three months, officials from the group said Wednesday. Ready for Hillary's haul came from more than 38,000 contributions, according to group spokesman Seth Bringman, giving the group an average contribution of $52. The $2 million is in line with what Ready for Hillary has raised in the past, but slightly less than the record $2.5 million the group raised in the second quarter. Ready for Hillary is part of a cadre of pro-Clinton outside groups that are organizing for Clinton's likely run at the presidency. Unlike other super PACs, which are focused on communications and large-money donors, Ready for Hillary has tried to focus on small, grass-roots donations. So far, the group has raised over $10 million. But in the third quarter of 2014, Ready for Hillary also moved to do more than just raise money and began to raise its profile in the eyes of many longtime Clinton confidants by having a large presence at events like September's Harkin Steak Fry in Indianola, Iowa. Led by former Clinton aides and supporters, the super PAC also began to dish out money to state parties, local candidates and other Democratic groups, as well as helping raise money for 2014 candidates whom Clinton has endorsed. After Clinton endorsed Bruce Braley in Iowa, for example, the group blasted out an email to its supporters asking them to donate money to the Democrat's Senate campaign. Ready for Hillary also maxed out contributions during the third quarter to Vincent Sheheen, South Carolina's Democratic candidate for governor, Bakari Sellers, the state's Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor and the South Carolina Democratic Party. Donating money to state parties has been a Ready for Hillary strategy for much of the year. Last month, a source with the group said Ready for Hillary had donated thousands of dollars to 29 state parties. Most of these donations were close to $10,000, the maximum the group can give to a state party. Part of this stepped up involvement in early states is in reaction to the fact that other possible 2016 Democrats are already making moves there, too. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley moved political staff into South Carolina in August and has been raising money for state Democrats for months. Vice President Joe Biden also has been heavily involved with helping local South Carolina politicos raise money since 2013. Ready for Hillary began sending political staff to 14 states -- including Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire -- on October 1.","Ready for Hillary raises over $2 million in last three months, spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Dr. Sean Kumer is actually happy when a call from work wakes him from a deep sleep. A call means the transplant surgeon at The University of Kansas Hospital can save another life. He worries, though, about possible changes being discussed regarding the way donated organs are distributed; if they go into effect, he may not be able to save so many lives. ""I worry (the possible changes) will harm my patients,"" Kumer said. On September 16, the United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit that manages the nation's transplant system, will hold a public hearing to discuss ways to ""increase equity"" in how organs are assigned to patients across the country. Each organ has a different system for handling its waiting list, and the network has seen a particular problem with donated livers. Currently, a donated liver is supposed to go first to the person who is most likely to die without a transplant, but the system also takes geographic factors into consideration. That means the sickest person in the country doesn't always get dibs. Instead, the system uses a ""local, regional and national"" algorithm. There are wide disparities in the number of organs available in the country's 11 regions. In the South and Midwest, donations are high. Donations on the coasts are low. So if you live in California, an area that has one of the lowest liver donation rates, you would probably wait longer to qualify for a transplant than someone who lives in Tennessee, in a region where the donation rates are much higher. That's why Apple co-founder Steve Jobs flew to Tennessee to get his liver transplant, even though he lived thousands of miles away in California. These are disparities the organ network considers ""unacceptably high."" (PDF) The biggest problem is a serious shortage of donated livers. Although about 6,000 liver transplant operations happen each year, that's only a fraction of those who need them. There are 15,600 people on the waiting list right now. An average of 1,500 people die each year while waiting for a liver transplant across all regions, whether there is a generous donor community or not. And the number of people needing liver transplants is expected to rise. With the nation's obesity epidemic, fatty liver disease has become a growing problem with more patients needing transplants. ""We lose someone every week who never got a shot at a lifesaving liver transplant because of where they live,"" said Dr. David Mulligan, chief of transplantation and immunology at Yale and chairman of the United Network for Organ Sharing committee considering the change. ""That same person would have had a shot if they lived in Kansas or Georgia or Louisiana."" To address this disparity, Mulligan says, his committee is open to ideas. Right now, it is considering a variety of mathematical models. One would reduce the 11 U.S. transplant regions to four or eight. Centers on the West and East coasts could see a 40% to 50% increase in volume with this shift, according to some estimates. These models worry doctors who live in the regions where the supply of donated organs is better. Doctors in Kansas benefit from a highly successful donor outreach program and don't want their region to be an ""organ farm"" for the parts of the country where not as many donate, Kumer says. ""What they are attempting to do is say, 'Hey, those guys have all the organs. Let's go over and poach those' instead of having their own grass-roots campaign to identify new donors,"" Kumer said. Dr. Tim Schmitt, director of transplantation at The University of Kansas Hospital, thinks the organ network's committee is looking at the problem the wrong way. Instead of shifting regions, he believes, it should focus on signing up more organ donors. ""That's where we should devote all our energy, rather than just shuffle the organs around the country,"" Schmitt said. ""I think everyone in UNOS and in the transplant community wants to save more lives; that is a no-brainer. But we feel that geographic disparity is more a reflection of other broader problems."" This week, Schmitt and doctors at dozens of transplant centers in the Midwest and the South sent a letter of protest to the organ network, urging the committee not to make any changes until all available data are considered. If the network implements the ""concept"" proposal and broadens the geographic boundaries for sharing donor livers, it would ""represent the most drastic change in liver allocation ever,"" the authors wrote, and ""would significantly disadvantage many areas of the country currently able to serve their patient populations."" A congressional delegation from Georgia also sent a letter in April, asking the network to put a hold on the remapping process. Their letter argues that the changes could reduce the ""number of liver transplants performed in Georgia by 25%"" and ""inevitably drive up costs, decrease survival rates, and waste precious resources in an already constrained sector of healthcare."" Transporting organs longer distances could cost health care centers $30 million more annually, according to some estimates. Mulligan argues that cost would be offset when doctors have to take care of fewer people with end-stage liver failure. Mulligan says his committee will make sure it does not ""hurt the regions that have been successful"" with organ donation. He believes that ultimately, a new system will save hundreds of lives every year. ""We are totally aware that there are certain parts of the country that will see big shifts, and that will be scary to them, but we have to take off our hats that represent our individual centers and think about what is best for patients all across the country,"" Mulligan said. Both sides of the debate agree though, that no matter how the system will change, it is only a temporary fix akin to ""rearranging the deck chairs on a sinking ship,"" Mulligan said. ""We are going to continue to have this problem if people don't donate."" To become an organ donor, register at OrganDonor.gov.

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN)  -- In a landmark case, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that Turkish authorities failed to protect a woman from her abusive ex-husband, effectively allowing his pattern of domestic violence to lead to the killing of her mother at gunpoint. Judges unanimously ruled that the Turkish state violated three articles prohibiting torture and discrimination, and ensuring the right to life of the victim. Legal experts said the ruling sets a precedent throughout Turkey and Europe for governments to protect women from domestic abuse. ""It's a very good decision,"" said Pinar Ilkkaracan, co-founder of the Istanbul-based organization Women for Women's Human Rights. ""This means now that the state must take effective measures to protect women from violence."" According to a Turkish government study released in February, four out of 10 Turkish women are beaten by their husbands. The European Union-funded poll concluded that ""one out of 10 women has reported to have been beaten during her pregnancy."" Turkey passed the Family Protection Act in 1998, which is supposed to offer women protection against domestic violence. But in the case, Opuz v. Turkey, judges ruled that the ""discriminatory judicial passivity in Turkey created a climate that was conducive to domestic violence."" Court documents state that in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir, Nahide Opuz, 36, and her mother were the repeat victims of attacks by the woman's ex-husband, Huseyin Opuz, referred to as H.O. ""Criminal proceedings were brought against H.O. on three occasions,"" the court wrote. On one occasion, Huseyin Opuz ran over the two women with a car. In 2001, he stabbed his ex-wife seven times with a knife. The ex-wife survived the assault. Turkish authorities detained and then released her ex-husband after fining him the equivalent of about $580. Less than a year later, Opuz shot and killed his former mother-in-law. She was killed in a moving van while transporting her daughter's family to the safety of another Turkish city. The court report states Opuz ""claims that he killed the applicant's wife because his honor had been at stake as she had taken his wife and children away from him, and had led his wife into an immoral way of life."" In its unanimous decision Tuesday, European Court judges ruled Turkey violated laws since Nahide Opuz's mother ""was killed by the applicant's ex-husband, despite the fact that the domestic authorities had been repeatedly alerted about his violent behavior."" Judges awarded the victim 30,000 euros in damages. Lawyers and women's rights activists argue the court decision puts pressure on Turkey to implement laws to protect women, which were ratified more than a decade ago. ""I don't believe the state is sincerely working on this matter,"" said Aydeniz Alisbah Tuskan, a representative of the Istanbul Bar Association Women's Rights Center. ""Every municipality is required to have a women's shelter. Yet when we ask them what their plans are, it becomes clear they are not taking any initiative."" Tuskan cited polls that indicate up to 40 percent of Turkish women believe they deserve to be beaten by their husbands. Day-time talk shows and newspapers in Turkey regularly report accounts of domestic violence and honor killings. Nahide Opuz could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Speaking by telephone from Diyarbakir, her attorney, Mesud Bestas, told CNN she is not giving interviews because she still fears for her life. In March 2008, Huseyin Opuz was released after serving six years in prison. Since then, he allegedly has made inquiries, searching for his ex-wife's address. Bestas said she has twice asked Turkish authorities to grant the woman protection. ""Nothing was done,"" the attorney said.","European court rules Turkey failed to protect a woman from abusive ex-husband .

"(CNN) -- Every morning before school, nine-year-old Terisia Techu would undergo a painful procedure. Her mother would take a burning hot pestle straight out of a fire and use it to press her breasts. With tears in her eyes as she recalls what it was like, Terisia tells CNN that one day the pestle was so hot, it burned her, leaving a mark. Now 18, she is still traumatized. Her mother, Grace, denies the incident. But she proudly demonstrates the method she used on her daughter for several weeks, saying the goal was to make her less desirable to boys -- and stave off pregnancy. A study found that one in four girls in Cameroon have been affected by the practice. The U.S. State Department, in its 2010 human rights report on Cameroon, cited news reports and said breast ironing ""victimized numerous girls in the country"" and in some cases ""resulted in burns, deformities, and psychological problems."" There are more than 200 ethnic groups in Cameroon with different norms and customs. Breast ironing is practiced by all of them. Some mothers use hot stones or coconut shells to flatten their daughters' breasts. Doctors believe improved diets have resulted in young Cameroonian girls going through puberty early. Many of them are also becoming pregnant early. Terisia became pregnant at 15. Her child died at birth. She told CNN that breast ironing doesn't work. She hates the practice and wishes her mother had instead talked to her about sex and preventing pregnancy. Grace Techu argues that if it weren't for the breast ironing, Terisia would have become pregnant at an even younger age. Techu has four daughters, and she used the procedure on the first two. The third avoided it because her breasts are growing at an acceptable rate, Techu says, and the fourth girl is still too young. Mothers who want their children to finish school before becoming parents have resorted to this drastic measure, and many see nothing wrong with it. In 2006, a German nongovernmental organization exposed the practice, which at the time was done mainly in secret. Now, charities have embarked on campaigns to educate mothers in Cameroon that sex education -- not breast ironing -- is the solution to ending teenage pregnancy. Dr Sinou Tchana, a gynecologist in Cameroon, has seen breast glands that were destroyed. She also saw one case of cancer, though she says it couldn't be established whether the ironing caused or only exacerbated the cancer. ""One mother came with secondary burns because the stone she was using to do this breast ironing burned her,"" Tchana says. One of Tchana's patients is a 23-year-old whose scars are still painful 14 years after her breasts were ironed. She has joined the effort to confront mothers about the effects of their actions. The challenge for all those trying to stop the practice is reaching parents like Techu in villages before a ritual that they say is motivated by love shatters more lives. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","1 in 4 girls in Cameroon are affected, a study found .

"(CNN) -- Police recently seized a cab owned by Jesse Matthew, the last person seen with missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham and who also has been linked to another college student's death in 2009, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. According to the source, Matthew was driving the cab in 2009, when 20-year-old Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville. She was last seen hitchhiking along U.S. 29 outside of Charlottesville, and her remains were found on a farm months later. No arrests have been made in her case, and the cause of her death still is under investigation. Yet, late last month, DNA evidence linked Matthew to Harrington's death, a law enforcement source told CNN. Around that time, Matthew was a private contractor for the owner of a local, now-defunct cab company called Access. Police have spoken to several cab drivers who worked with Matthew then, the source with knowledge of the investigation said. Previously, Matthew had worked for at least one other Charlottesville taxi company -- Yellow Cab -- according to its owner Mark Brown. He had a license to operate a taxi in the Virginia city from 2005 to 2010, according to Todd Divers, Charlottesville's commissioner of revenue. The 32-year-old Matthew is now behind bars, arrested in Texas as a suspect in Graham's disappearance. He was transferred to Virginia and charged with abduction with intent to defile, and is being held in a Virginia jail. Meanwhile, authorities say they don't know where Graham is. Almost from the start, speculation was raised about the possibility of a connection between Graham's disappearance and Harrington's death. ""Certainly the question has arisen. It's certainly a legitimate question,"" Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters last month. Hannah Graham's disappearance: What we know .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- A third beluga whale belonging to the world's largest aquarium has died, the Georgia Aquarium announced late Monday. The exact cause of Nico's sudden death on Saturday is inconclusive from the initial necropsy or animal autopsy. The Georgia Aquarium hopes to find out more information in the months ahead from a more detailed necropsy. ""As we work with and care for the many animals at the Georgia Aquarium, we become attached emotionally,"" said Dr. Gregory D. Bossart, chief veterinary officer at the aquarium. ""The loss is not unlike that of faithful dog or special horse that has been a part your life for years."" Nico died at Sea World in San Antonio, where he and two other beluga whales had been moved temporarily while the Georgia Aquarium is undergoing renovation. Nico was scheduled to return home to Atlanta next month with companions Maris and Natasha. Nico arrived in Atlanta with Gaspar, two whales obtained from a park in Mexico. Both animals suffered ""significant health issues"" from their times in a foreign park and were essentially ""living on borrowed time,"" said Bossart, who had been caring for the two whales as far as nine years ago, while they were still in Mexico. ""We rescued Nico knowing that he had health issues due to his prior home, but we were confident that we could provide a better quality of life for his final years,"" Bossart said. Gaspar was suffering from a bone disease contracted before arriving at the downtown Atlanta aquarium and was euthanized in January 2007. Another beluga whale, Marina, died 11 months later from complications of old age. Beluga whales or white whales, whose name is derived from a Russian word meaning white, typically live in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions including Canada, Russia, Greenland and the U.S. state of Alaska. They can live up to 35 years. The belugas are not the only high-profile deaths at the Georgia Aquarium, which opened in late 2005. A pair of whale sharks have also died at the eight-million-gallon facility, the only one outside Asia to display the giant fish.

"(CNN) -- Fashion is about making a statement. Designer Nili Lotan has been culling imagery from socio-political issues like the fall of the Berlin Wall and the West Bank's ""separation barrier"" to create high fashion for nearly a decade. ""The fabric becomes a canvas, and you're basically saying something,"" Lotan told CNN in her lower Manhattan showroom. ""The idea is not to express my own opinion, but rather to provoke a thought or an opinion of whoever is wearing it or whoever is watching it."" Next month, the Israeli-born designer will display a retrospective of her ""Fashion Meets Photojournalism"" series at her New York store. She'll recut her signature silk cami dresses from past collections for the project, as well as debut a new dress featuring politically-charged photography by Allan Tannenbaum. Proceeds will be donated to help both sides of the recent Israel-Hamas hostilities that killed more than 2,000 people and severely damaged Gaza's infrastructure. Lotan, who moved to New York from Israel in 1980, said like most creatives, she draws on what she knows -- her upbringing and subsequent life experiences -- to find inspiration. As a child of parents who met in a World War II refugee camp in Austria, her interest in global affairs started at a young age. ""We are very much tuned into the news, into current events, into social justice,"" she said. ""From the day I remember sound, I remember every day my dad listened to the radio news."" Interactive: War & Fashion . Her love of clothes and art, though, came solely from her mother, who had studied textile design before the war and never really got to use it on a larger scale after she emigrated to Israel. ""One of the mediums she expressed her creativity was clothes, and back in those days, it sounds strange, but we really didn't have too many stores to go and buy clothes,"" Lotan said, so her mother made them for the family. A resident of Israel, Lotan served the mandatory two years of military service for women, as social services chair of the air force. After her service, she enrolled in Shenkar College of Engineering and Design, with her mother's urging, after an academic degree opened up specifically for textile and fashion design. That sewed up her fate. Before starting her eponymous line in 2003, Lotan worked for apparel companies like Ralph Lauren, Adrienne Vittadini, Liz Claiborne and Nautica. After a trip to Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War with her husband, musician David Broza, Lotan decided to combine her interests in fashion and current affairs. ""When we came back, I had an urge and a need to scream and say something about the situation,"" Lotan said. ""I was certainly not-pro gun or promoting the use of guns, but just protesting against the war."" While the rest of her collections tend to focus on a classic, modern and minimal aesthetic, Lotan debuted a gun-print, silk charmeuse dress, blouse and scarf. Retailer pulls shirts reminiscent of Holocaust . The mechanics of her textile printing are a sartorial choice, first and foremost, Lotan said. ""When I place it on the fabric, I don't just post it,"" Lotan said. ""There is a play between the fabric and the picture."" Seven years after the debut of Lotan's first politically inspired piece, supermodel Karolina Kurkova garnered headlines for wearing one of her gun print dresses in 2013. Critics called Kurkova insensitive as she was photographed in the dress amid Congress' failure to pass an assault weapons ban and as the nation was still mourning the Newtown shootings and Boston Marathon bombings. Lotan said she now focuses on acts of protest -- cultural change imagery from Woodstock, the Paris protests of 1968 and anti-Vietnam street art of ""Peace gotta come now"" -- so that her prints are not misconstrued and taken out of context. Still, the designer doesn't plan to stop blurring the lines between style and social issues anytime soon.","Nili Lotan is a fashion designer known for combining photojournalism and textiles .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs says it will study the effects of toxic emissions from burning trash at military installations in Iraq and Afghanistan on veterans, even after the Department of Defense has concluded no long-term effects exist. Studies of the smoke from the burn pits suggests it contains dioxin and other toxins. The extent of the VA's intention was discussed in a letter to concerned congressmen that was sent on Friday and obtained by CNN. In the letter responding to the congressmen's inquiry on the subject, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki said he shared ""concerns that some veterans could have health problems from such exposures."" ""Our previous experiences with returning Vietnam War and Gulf War veterans show that we must take these concerns very seriously,"" he added. Shinseki said the Department of Veterans Affairs will study the problem as part of an effort to analyze effects of troops' exposures in general and suggested it might even seek a parallel independent study. ""We are currently evaluating the need for an independent assessment by nongovernmental scientific experts to help us understand the health effects of various combat exposures,"" Shinseki wrote. Sources familiar with the plan said the VA is finalizing a deal with the government's Institute of Medicine to conduct the study. The IOM did a similar investigation of Gulf War Syndrome and other effects from the first Iraq war. The emissions, from what are known as burn pits, have been a concern for troops, especially those who served at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq. Many soldiers who went through Balad became used to ""Iraqi crud,"" as they dubbed the symptom of excessive coughing and black phlegm. Soldiers complained of respiratory problems and skin infections, and in some cases believed they developed leukemia and tumors from the exposure. The pits at Balad were at one point open and burning everything from plastics and food to medical waste, sometimes with jet fuel used as an accelerant. In later years, incinerators were installed at Balad, but other bases in Iraq and Afghanistan still use the pits without incinerators to burn garbage. The military said last year that smoke from the Balad pit exposed troops to toxic emissions, including low levels of cancer-causing dioxins. However, its tests indicated there is no long-term danger, officials said. The U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM) conducted a study of air samples at Balad after concerns were raised about the toxic nature of the pervasive smoke from the incineration pits. The air samples were collected between January and April 2007. But the report admitted that it cannot account for everything burned in the pit. An additional 107 samples were collected in October and November 2007. The results of those tests will be released early in 2009. Many in the veterans' community remain unconvinced that burn pits were harmless. A group from Congress wrote to the Department of Defense and the VA demanding more tests. In his response, Shinseki said the veterans department has an ongoing study comparing 30,000 veterans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and 30,000 nondeployed veterans. It is evaluating ""self reported exposures (including burning trash and feces), symptoms, chronic health conditions, functional status, pregnancy outcomes and health care utilization,"" Shinseki wrote. Most relevant to the burn pit concerns, Shinseki said the VA will ""work with the DoD to obtain all relevant exposure data with the goal of establishing potential correlations with health problems among affected veterans."" ""Our scientists will also review data gathered from DoD's Post Deployment Health Assessment surveys, which ask about exposures to smoke from burn pits, subsequent symptoms, and a variety of other health related questions,"" Shinseki wrote. ""VA will evaluate the feasibility of monitoring toxic substances in veterans, although most toxic materials from burn pits may be eliminated from the bodies of exposed veterans in a matter of days or weeks."" Rep. Tim Bishop, D-New York, a leading congressional agitator for further inquiry into this subject, said he was encouraged by the response. ""Since time is of the essence and the lives of our troops and veterans are at stake, we expect the Department of Defense will fully cooperate with the VA, so that these analyses can be completed as quickly and accurately as possible,"" Bishop said in a statement. Kerry Baker, with the group Disabled American Veterans, said the response is a start but not as focused on the burn pit issue as his group would have liked. ""This is a decent letter, but it doesn't get to the root of the problem,"" Baker said. ""I would like to see them do studies on surrounding areas near burn pits compared to nondeployed troops."" The VA's decision to look at exposures beyond the burn pits reflects its experience looking into Gulf War Syndrome, VA spokesman Jim Benson said. The department recognizes that it needs to start now to investigate long-term affects for burn pit exposure as well as potential exposures that might lead to illness down the road. ""What we found is after the first Gulf War when a possible threat would be identified, the VA and DoD would go all-out looking at that particular problem. Now we are structuring a broad-based program that isn't going to just ask ""were you around burn pits"" but ask ""how is your health"" in general, Benson explained. In the meantime, Benson explained, veterans with health issues they believe are related to the burn pits will get the health care they need from the VA. ""The studies will provide us with the larger picture of the risks the veterans have gone through,"" explained Benson. ""We have the medicine and facilities to give them the care while the doctors are sorting out what caused what."" Disabled American Veterans has started collecting information on veterans concerned with exposure. Its database of nearly 200 veterans with significant exposure to the burn pits shows nearly a third have contracted cancer and another third have developed pulmonary issues, according to the group. Skin lesions and allergy symptoms have also arisen. Benson said the VA has not seen evidence so far of significant levels of leukemia and cancer, but he said that does not mean the problem does not exist or may not arise. ""The key is the research needs to make that connection between the exposure and the disease. Some of those things don't match up, but that's what the research has to validate,"" Benson said. ""This does not preclude us from health care if they provide this is service-connected,"" Benson said. ""If something is wrong with you that is related or you think is related to military service, the doors are wide open,"" Benson said.","VA finalizing deal with Institute of Medicine to assess potential health risks .

"(CNN) -- Many Americans might feel reassured when Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Protection, says the battle against Ebola in the United States is being waged effectively. His bedside manner is impeccable and his calm confident demeanor inspiring. Yet many might also wonder how the Ebola virus entered the United States and appeared in Dallas under his watch in the first place. So where is the reassuring guy with the beard and the fancy naval uniform festooned with medals, who warned us for so long about the dangers of smoking? The colorful and trustworthy former surgeon general of the United States, Dr. C. Everett Koop? At a time when many Americans are afraid of the possible spread of a deadly virus, we do not have a full-fledged surgeon general -- often called the ""Nation's Doctor"" -- and have not had one since Regina Benjamin resigned in 2013. We don't notice government officials are missing until a crisis emerges. Now, when Americans perceive what's happening with Ebola as a national health crisis, the seat of the ""Doctor in Charge"" remains empty. Yes, we have an acting surgeon general, Rear Adm. Boris Lushniak, but the President has expressed no interest in appointing him to the permanent spot, and without the support of the President, the post doesn't have much power. Although Sen. John McCain is urging the appointment of an ""Ebola czar,"" it should be the surgeon general in full battle attire, the ""Nation's Doctor,"" who is stepping up. Who's to blame for this vacancy at a time when Ebola is causing two-thirds of Americans to fear a widespread epidemic? Complete coverage on Ebola . The Republicans blame the President for nominating Dr. Vivek Murthy, a 36-year-old physician and entrepreneur. Republicans say he's too young, and his prime qualification for the nation's most prestigious medical post appears to be that he was once co-chairman of ""Doctors for Obama."" Democrats counter that Republican opposition has nothing to do with the highly trained doctor's tender age, but is based on his support of the Affordable Care Act and his opinion that gun violence is a public health issue. Putting the gun issue aside, 36 does seem a little young to take on such an important post. Many medical doctors are just finishing advanced training in their mid-30s. Searching for a prestigious hospital affiliation and joining a good medical practice are their primary concerns, not the formation of national health policy. While Murthy has impressive academic credentials, surely a little more seasoning is required to be a surgeon general. Undoubtedly the President's advisers could easily locate an experienced, articulate and relatively nonpolitical doctor who would be proud to assume the post. We don't pick our doctors for their politics, we pick them for their experience and their competence. The surgeon general should be selected in the same spirit -- and one would hope that the President and Congress would have figured this out. At some point, the surgeon general must stand at the podium and inspire the confidence of the American people. The post has been around for a long time, dating back in slightly different forms to the presidency of Ulysses Grant, who managed to appoint a competent physician while putting the country back together in the aftermath of the Civil War. Surely our political leaders can muster the will to put a seasoned surgeon general at the helm as soon as possible. Nothing is more reassuring to a sick and troubled patient than the calm and steady voice of a physician offering sound advice and proper medical treatment.","Paul Callan: CDC head is playing 'Nation's Doctor' in reassuring Americans about Ebola .

"(CNN) -- The publication this week of memoirs by Leon Panetta has stirred up a sharp controversy in the press, but as so often happens these days in Washington, the focus seems to be on the sensational rather than the important. And that leads to the larger argument: whether Panetta, Bob Gates et. al. should have published these books may be controversial, but it is a sideshow compared to what's really important -- and that's what they have to say about the making and execution of American foreign policy these days. White House aides and allies of the President were naturally upset to read some of the stinging comments by the former defense secretary and CIA director about the inner workings of the Obama administration. Overlooking the fact that Panetta was also generous in his praise about the President, they set out to slime him. How dare he criticize Obama while still in office, they asked. His book was ""dishonorable"" and ""sad,"" proclaimed a former White House spokesman on CNN. He willfully misrepresented the past, complained another. And on and on. The press likes nothing better than a food fight among top officials, so naturally enough, they weighed in on whether Panetta -- and other Obama heavyweights like former Defense Secretary Bob Gates, who had also written searching memoirs, had done wrong. One can argue the merits of ""kiss and tell"" books till the cows come home. For decades, they were widely seen as verboten. When I came to Washington in the late '60s, the standard was that one should wait a ""discreet interval"" before writing an inside story. As columnist Ed Luce pointed out in the Financial Times this week, Dean Acheson waited nearly 20 years to write his splendid account of the Truman years, ""Present at the Creation."" But those standards broke down during the Nixon years as John Dean, Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and others -- angry with their boss and in need of cash -- wrote shocking inside looks at his tortured presidency. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein soon persuaded a slew of other Nixon aides to spill their guts, creating a whole new genre of quickie, insider books. Within a few years, it became standard practice for White House aides to sit down regularly with Woodward to make sure their side of the story got out. It's hard to see why it is so much worse to write memoirs about your governmental years and publicly put your name on them -- as Panetta and Gates have done -- than to anonymously give Woodward, Elizabeth Drew or other authors inside documents and self-serving, behind-the-scenes accounts of your days in Valhalla. At least Panetta and Gates have had the guts to stand up and be counted. Two other points should be made about the propriety of these books from the Obama era: . The people who have written the most searching books about his national security policies -- Panetta, Gates, Hillary Clinton, and Vali Nasr -- didn't come into this administration as neophytes searching for the brass ring. Each of them had already won distinction for their years of public service. Panetta and Gates had purposefully moved far away from Washington and wanted to stay away. They had to be persuaded to serve this time -- and they did so mostly out of love of country. (As defense secretary, Panetta frequently flew to California for weekends just so he could be home again.) Even if their books have had some sharp things to say, they thus deserve a reasoned hearing on the substance -- not a flaying by people half their stature and with half their experience. (By the way, have you heard any White House aides thank Panetta lately for serving as the chief mastermind in the search for Osama Bin Laden?) The other point is that these recent books are about our conduct during wars that are hardly our shining hours. Democrats in particular should remember Robert McNamara, a hero of the Cuban Missile Crisis but a goat of Vietnam. For years after he resigned as defense chief to President Lyndon Johnson, McNamara was castigated because he kept his silence when he left. I well remember instances when parents of slain American veterans screamed at McNamara that he should have gone public with an account of how and why Vietnam went so badly wrong inside the LBJ administration. There is surely something to be said for Americans understanding today just how we have handled -- and mishandled -- violence in the Middle East since 9/11. Who better to tell us than the men and women who were there at the top? Running through all these books is a common set of concerns about trends that started before Obama but have reached new peaks during his presidency: . -- To a person, these authors -- and others who served with them at the State Department, the Pentagon, the Joint Chiefs, the CIA and elsewhere among national security agencies -- believe that power has become entirely too centralized in the White House. The National Security Council staff is now dangerously swollen: as Foreign Policy Magazine editor David Rothkopf reminds us, Obama has increased NSC staff to well over 300 people, doubling its size since George W. Bush and capping off a tenfold increase since the 1970s. Inevitably, the professionals at the NSC, with proximity to the Oval Office, want to run things. They can't: History has proven time and again that once a President makes a decision, the White House should continue to monitor closely but must leave most of the execution to the professionals in the departments. -- Excessive centralization has also meant that too often, the men and women who run the departments feel marginalized. Not only do they feel two steps removed from the President, but foreign counterparts have little reason to engage with them when real power rests in the White House. Former officials also say the White House acts as a ""choke point,"" limiting diverse opinions and slowing down decisive implementation. -- Perhaps most perniciously, the authors of these books believe that too often the advice of the President's inner circle has been heavily colored by political considerations, overriding substantive arguments. Politics, of course, plays a role in all presidential decision-making, but traditionally, policy advisers exercise the biggest voice on the big national security calls. There will be time enough after President Obama leaves office for historians -- along with Bob Woodward and others -- to weigh the evidence and reach more studied conclusions about how wisely he and his White House team ran national security. But there is real value today in hearing from some of the most respected men and women in national security offering assessments -- pro and con -- about how things are run. President Obama, writes David Ignatius of the Washington Post, is considering some serious personnel changes for his last two years in office. He has already appointed a highly regarded retired general, John Allen, to oversee the campaign against ISIS. It would be good to see more John Allens elsewhere in the higher reaches. But it would be equally valuable if the President took stock of how decisions and execution of national security issues are managed inside. For all the controversy, books by Leon Panetta, Bob Gates, Hillary Clinton and others offer invaluable guides. Each of them has made yet another contribution to the well-being of the country.","David Gergen: Obama allies focused on whether Panetta should have written book so soon .

"(CNN) -- Wind power provides a fifth of Denmark's electricity, most of it generated by giant wind farms built on land and in the country's coastal waters. But the tiny Danish island of Samso is proving bigger isn't necessarily better by generating all its electricity using wind turbines of its own. Nineteen miles off the coast of mainland Denmark, 91 turbines reach 114 meters above the turbulent waters of the North Sea. Together they form Horns Rev 2, the world's biggest offshore wind farm, which can generate enough electrify to power 200,000 homes. Anders Eldrup is CEO of Dong Energy, which operates Horns Rev 2. He told CNN that Denmark's trailblazing efforts in wind power are the result of the country's energy crisis during the 1970s. ""The Danes were totally dependant on oil imported from the Middle East. Suddenly there was an embargo, so no oil. We learnt the lesson the hard way that you have to have diversified supplies of energy."" The World Wind Energy Association says wind power currently provides 1.5 percent of the world's electricity. That's a drop in the ocean, but as a clean and renewable source of energy, wind power is receiving support from governments around the world. ""I have to admit that the reason there is a business is that there are some government subsidies attached to wind production,"" said Eldrup. ""That goes for Denmark and that goes for other European countries where we are doing wind operations."" The U.S. government recently announced that its economic stimulus bill contributed to a 39 percent increase in the country's wind power output last year, defying predictions that new wind energy output would decline because of harsh economic conditions. ""Small wind"" is also being promoted, with governments encouraging individual households to produce their own wind power using micro turbines. The United States offers a 30 percent investment tax credit to people who buy micro turbines. Many other countries offer grants for installing turbines, as well as feed-in-tariff payments that allow individuals to sell the electricity they generate to their national grid network. Are wind farms an underused source of clean energy, or a blot on the landscape? Leave your comments in the ""Sound Off"" box at the bottom of this article. When it comes to small-scale renewable energy, the Danish island of Samso -- population 4,000 -- is an example to the world. Among its energy-production facilities are 11 one-megawatt turbines on the island itself and 10 more turbines within three miles of its coast. As well as using wind turbines to provide electricity, and straw-burning plants to provide heating, some islanders have solar panels on their roofs and others warm their homes using geothermal energy and the heat given off by fresh cow's milk. Jesper Kjems, of the Samso Energy Academy, told CNN, ""100 percent of our electricity comes from onshore turbines. About 75 percent of our heating comes from heating plants and private people who have changed their oil furnaces to something renewable. ""Then we have the offshore turbines, which compensate for what we use in fossil fuels, heating and transport. All in all we send more energy to the mainland than we use."" Two of Samso's turbines are owned by a co-operative of around 450 of the island's residents. ""[They] are the most important ones because they are the turbines that give the normal guy on the island the opportunity of investing in turbines,"" said Kjems. While the residents of Samso can take advantage of their island's blustery weather, open spaces and low-population density to be carbon neutral, the success of wind energy on a global scale may come down to simple economics. Danish company Vestas is the world's biggest supplier of wind turbines. Its president for Northern Europe, Klaus Mortensen, told CNN, ""We are very focused on providing the lowest cost of energy. With the present system we are competitive with oil at $50 a barrel."" There is an expectation that prices will come down as turbines become cheaper and bigger companies throw their buying power into developing wind farms. Eldrup told CNN, ""Our initiatives, small company that we are, whatever we do won't change the world. ""But if we can be a good example so that some of the big guys will do some of the same things then the implications can be much bigger. That would be wonderful."" What do you think? Should we all try to live like the Samso islanders? Have your say by leaving a comment in the Sound off box below.","A fifth of Denmark's electricity comes from wind power .

"(CNN) -- For the second time in less than week, Venezuela has announced the nationalization of a manufacturing plant, this time a privately owned steel mill. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Sunday his government will take over the Sidetur steel manufacturing plant. Chavez announced October 25 that the government was nationalizing two U.S.-owned Owens-Illinois glass-manufacturing plants. Jose Paredes, the vice minister for basic industries and mining, said the government needs to take over the Sidetur plant because it was not providing enough steel to meet the nation's construction demands. ""This business needs to meet the needs of the country,"" Paredes was quoted as saying by the state-run Agencia Venezolana de Noticias. Sidetur is owned by Vivencia, which had two mineral plants appropriated by the government in 2008. Chavez also nationalized the nation's largest steel plant, Sidor, in 2008. The leftist president has had a history of nationalizing industries and land holdings during his 11-year tenure. Last year, he nationalized a local unit of U.S. food giant Cargill. He previously has appropriated privately owned oil, telecommunications, power and cement companies.","The takeover of the Sidetur plant is the second nationalization announced in less than a week .

CNN: What drove you to stay? When I came back, I realized that I could be a part of the solution and not pretend that it didn't exist and go to live my life somewhere else. I realized that I owed it to myself and also to my community to be a part of its future in a way that is more helpful. CNN: What is Sustainable South Bronx's mission? Sustainable South Bronx advocates for environmental justice through sustainable environmental and economic development projects. CNN: How has Sustainable South Bronx evolved over the last seven years? Sustainable South Bronx has gone from being an army of one, me, to about 12 staff all working on policy and projects that are going to improve the quality of life, economically and environmentally, for folks in the community. CNN: What are the biggest challenges you face? The biggest challenge is helping Manhattan understand that they are technically an island, but they are not an island. Right now, Manhattan doesn't handle any of its own waste or its power generation or anything of that nature. It exists in all its glory because of communities such as the South Bronx, so (we need to help) them to understand that when we hurt, they are going to hurt too. We are trying to alleviate poverty by creating green collar jobs and industries to promote them. We want to create opportunities that employ people so they can become an active part of the fabric of the city's life. We are trying to put all those things together so that this great shining jewel to our south, Manhattan, understands that we are actually part of the equation of making a more sustainable city. CNN: Could you tell me some of the problems that South Bronx faces in terms of dealing with industrial waste? The South Bronx handles about 40 percent of the city's commercial waste. We have a sewage treatment plant, a sewage sludge palletizing plant, four power plants and the diesel emissions from about 60,000 diesel truck trips each and every week. Those are not nice places to be around. They have a pretty severe private health crisis associated with them. On average, 25 percent of our kids have asthma. Our child asthma hospitalization rate is between four and seven times the national average. We've got a child obesity rate that is six times higher than the rest of the city, and of course obesity and diabetes go hand in hand. CNN: Where do you see Sustainable South Bronx in ten years? In ten years I hope that Sustainable South Bronx has worked itself out of a job because our work to help create the South Bronx as a hope for green businesses, for clean businesses, has taken off so much; that our 25 percent unemployment rate is in the past; that our asthma rates have plummeted because there is so much green space along the new Greenway that has been built here; that there are so many people bike riding and the diabetes rate is gone; and that Nobel Prize Laureates are being born. CNN: Is that realistic? Absolutely. In 10 years, if we play our cards right and make the right partnerships, whether that's with the city or with businesses, absolutely. I don't think it would take much for that to happen. When my parents moved here 60 years ago, this place was a working class community and it was thriving. We can be thriving again. There was a different kind of manufacturing then, but it was manufacturing and the jobs were right here in this country. People were able to make livings out of it and the gap between rich and poor was smaller. I think we need to decide as a society, as a country, that it's not ok that people are as poor as they are right now. We've got to decide that we want to live in a world that is sane and happy and healthy, and that everyone deserves that. CNN: What is the future of urban communities? So much of the world is going to be living in cities in the next 10 to 15 years. We have got to understand the designing of them, where people are in close proximity to each other but in a way that provides health and well-being to everybody. The density allows for safety, allows for people to get to know each other, the density allows people to walk and bike and get healthier as a result. That could be the kind of city that people will want to live in. Those are the kind of cities we need to re-imagine so that we are building them for people and not just for cars. What is your personal vision of how you can help to achieve that? My real dream is that everybody will see their self-interest tied up with someone else, whether or not they see them, and see that as an opportunity for growing closer together as a culture and as a world. Just because you have a piece of trash and you throw it away and it gets hauled away, it doesn't mean that it's not affecting someone else. If we had bothered to recognize how close our worlds are, it would be harder for people to dismiss places like the South Bronx.","Carter is founder of Sustainable South Bronx, advocating environmental justice .

"Monza, Italy (CNN) -- Mercedes has the fastest two cars in Formula One this season but there is just one problem -- there can only be one world champion. Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg arrive at the Italian Grand Prix this weekend with the title fight distilled into a thrillingly intense duel. Mercedes is desperate to keep a lid on the seething tensions spilling over from a Belgian bust-up as the German team chases its first world title since 1955. But is it too late to mend the poisoned relationship between the star drivers? Where did it go wrong? In the dry desert heat of Bahrain, rivalries between the Mercedes teammates began to sizzle. Rosberg complained over the team radio when Hamilton cut across him to retake the lead, saying the move was ""not on."" Mercedes then warned the drivers ""to bring both cars home"" as they vied for victory until the checkered flag. Monaco was not exactly home sweet home for Rosberg, who lives in the principality. After setting the fastest time in qualifying, the German went off track -- denying Hamilton, who was behind him, a chance to set his potential quickest time. There was more drama in Hungary when Mercedes asked Hamilton to allow Rosberg, who was on a different tire strategy, to pass. The 2008 world champion, who was second at the time, refused to obey the team order and finished third, one place ahead of Rosberg. The pair's duel was short but by no means sweet in Belgium two weeks ago. In an ill-judged attempt to take the lead on lap two, Rosberg gave Hamilton's car a punctured tire and effectively put him out of the race. The German finished second but was greeted by a chorus of boos on the podium from fans who saw his pass as a deliberately cynical move. Who's to blame? Rosberg increasingly finds himself cast as the bad guy, akin to Dick Dastardly in cartoon caper ""Wacky Races."" After admitting the Spa clash was his fault, Mercedes handed him a hefty fine -- although not by F1 driver salary standards. But the 29-year-old, who is always polite and affable in person, has since apologized to Hamilton and told the media melee in Monza this week he was not proud of his behavior. Rosberg may not be Machiavellian but one thing is for sure, Hamilton has had his share of bad luck in 2014. Whether it was brake failures or engine fires, fate has been a fickle friend. But is Hamilton entirely blameless? Well, the Briton has arguably brought some hard luck on himself. There have, in particular, been misjudgments in qualifying, most notably in Canada, Austria and Britain, when he chose not to set a final lap when the damp track conditions were improving. Interactive: Take a tour of the Monza circuit . Who's refereeing the fight? Mercedes wants to calm tensions between its racers as it attempts to win both the driver and constructor titles. Five days after the Belgium bust-up, the team issued a statement warning ""another such incident will not be tolerated."" It added: ""Lewis and Nico understand and accept the team's number one rule: there must be no contact between the team's cars on track."" Mercedes motorsport director Toto Wolff said in Italy he was not ruling out changing a driver lineup if ""we are not able to manage the two of them."" Rosberg recently signed a new contract, which will keep him at the team until the end of 2016, while Hamilton has a deal until 2015. F1's governing body, the FIA, decided not to investigate the Spa clash, even after Rosberg admitted his culpability. There has been debate among F1 experts about whether the FIA should be more proactive in refereeing the heavyweight title bout or whether it should stand by and let the drivers slug it out. Asked by CNN in Italy whether the FIA should have investigated the Spa incident more closely, Hamilton responded: ""That's a very good question because how do we move forward? ""Does that mean we can race a lot closer and if the guy in front comes off and is out of the race, nothing's going to happen? Or does it mean if it happens again there will be a penalty? ""We're always asking to be able to race ... but there's a fine line."" Who's in pole position for the title? With seven races left to go, Rosberg has a 29-point lead over Hamilton. He is on course to win his first world title and follow in the footsteps of his father Keke, the 1982 champion. Hamilton knows this is his best chance of winning a second world title since his triumph with McLaren in 2008. The British racer has to keep out of trouble on track and hope his luck turns. There is, however, a new twist to the 2014 season, which could be decisive. The final race in Abu Dhabi will reward the drivers with double points, which means a win is worth 50 points and second place 36 points. But if Rosberg takes a 15-point advantage to the desert finale he can afford to finish second to Hamilton and still win the title. While the two Mercedes drivers are locked in an intense fight, Daniel Ricciardo is sneaking up on the rails. The Red Bull racer has the momentum after winning the last two races in Hungary and Belgium and is now 64 points behind Rosberg in the standings. Could the Australian snatch the title? ""Yeah I can,"" Ricciardo said in Italy. ""But it obviously is going to take more than just winning the next seven races. It is going to have to take a bit of luck as well. ""If they crash into each other at every race this year that will probably hand me the championship on a platter!"" Who can handle the heat? There is a feeling in the F1 paddock that the intense 2014 championship is turning into a psychological battle between the Mercedes men. ""Your mental state is always important in sport,"" Rosberg chirpily agreed in Italy. The Mercedes rivals are very different characters and very different racers. On one side of the garage is the ice-cool calm and consistency of Rosberg and on the other side is Hamilton's fiery passion and blistering pace. Keeping a cool head, as well as a steady hand on the wheel, could decide which of the contenders wins the 2014 world title.","Mercedes drivers Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton are battling for the F1 world championship .

"(CNN) -- In week five of the upcoming NFL season, the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks will play a nameless opponent. At least that's what it will look like in the sports pages of the hometown Seattle Times newspaper because that's when the Seahawks travel to Washington to play a team whose name has become a political football. ""It's time to ban the use of ""Redskins,"""" wrote sports editor Don Shelton, who called the nickname ""absurd, offensive and outdated."" ""The most controversial name in sports won't appear again in The Seattle Times' print edition or on the seattletimes.com home pages as long as I am sports editor,"" Don Shelton announced in a Thursday column. Seattle's only major daily print newspaper joins a growing list of others -- such as the Kansas City Star and San Francisco Chronicle -- that have chosen to do the same. Others outlets such as Slate, New Republic and Mother Jones have banned the word too, though those publications aren't exactly known for the breadth of their football coverage. A couple of hours to the south in Portland, the Pacific Northwest's other major daily -- the Oregonian -- banned the word outright in the early '90s. Back then, the Seattle Times was limiting its use to one mention per article and leaving it out of headlines and photo captions, according to Shelton. ""The decision felt progressive at the time,"" he said. ""(B)ut now we need to go further."" The usage of Native American imagery in sports has been a long-simmering controversy. The Redskins have increasingly become the primary focus of a campaign of sensitivity that has thus far failed to sway professional sports teams. In fact, some of the very same papers that have banned ""the R-word"" have done no such thing when it comes to the Native American-inspired Atlanta Braves, Kansas City Chiefs and Cleveland Indians. Is banning ""Redskins"" then a double standard? No, says Shelton. ""Some argue that if you ban Redskins, you have to ban all other Native American mascots. I don't agree,"" he wrote. ""(Other Native American nicknames) don't generate the same visceral reaction."" The collegiate level has been less reluctant to heed mounting calls for change. In 2005, the NCAA sought to end the controversy surrounding Native American mascots once and for all by ordering nearly 20 schools whose nicknames and mascots they deemed ""abusive in terms of race, ethnicity or national origin"" to either get Native American permission to use their name and likeness, or to come up with new monikers.

"(CNN) -- Music video and film director Sanaa Hamri moved to New York with dreams of making it big as an actress. But like so many others, she found herself struggling through endless auditions and unemployment. Born worlds away in the town of Tangier, Morocco, Hamri wasn't afraid to fight back. She'd grown up in a traditionally male-dominated society and her rebellion against gender stereotypes had helped put her on this creative career path. Refusing to give up, she changed tact finding work with a post production company. She was soon noticed by cinematographer Malik Sayeed who, in turn, introduced her to Mariah Carey. And with the famous singer's guidance, Hamri embarked on a new, highly successful, career trajectory, leaving her mark on the entertainment industry. Hamri went on to direct numerous high-profile music videos as well as three feature films and several episodes of popular TV shows like ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Glee."" Here she reveals to CNN what's like to collaborate with entertainment royalty like Lenny Kravitz or Nicki Minaj while achieving success among the stars in Tinseltown. Embrace your heritage. ""I'm a product of a multicultural union of my father who is and was Moroccan and my mother who is American,"" says Hamri. ""So I was able to grow in a household that had both. I very much identify as a Moroccan woman because I was born and raised there. My father's Moroccan and I went to school there so that is home to me."" Education is vital. Hamri's mother, Blanca taught at the American School of Tangier and she credits the establishment with providing opportunities that others in her neighborhood didn't have. ""The memory of it for me is education was something that was a gift that you have to take advantage of,"" she explains. Rebellion can ignite a journey you'd never contemplated before. ""I would look around and I would see all of these men in the cafes and on the streets and I would think to myself, 'I can be just like that and do whatever I want to do as you do.' Just because I'm of a different gender, that doesn't mean I can't drive, I can't rule, I can't think, I can't create."" Networking is key (especially when it's with Mariah Carey). While working for a production company, the ambitious Moroccan soon found herself in the midst of some of the biggest names in music but it was an introduction to ""songbird supreme"" Mariah Carey who would lead her to her calling. ""One day she turned to me and said, 'You know, you really should direct' ... And then I got the opportunity to direct her in this video called ""Thank God I Found You (Remix)"" ... [Directing] was extremely natural to me and I realized that Mariah was right -- this is where I belong."" Take every opportunity to learn something new and always ask questions. In addition to the mentoring Carey provided to her, the songstress would also provide industry insight and help explain the ins and outs of working among the best in the business. ""(She would say) 'this is what it means in America when we say this,' because she was used to foreigners. she understood that. And whether it was working with her, Jay-Z, or Destiny's Child, or Sting, any of those people, I would learn from them."" Never forget why you want to work in the industry. ""I realized I was able to use the medium of music videos as a way to communicate to young adults in an inspirational way. The minute I realized that, I quickly shifted my career, so I would turn down a lot of artists and projects due to lyrical content, due to meaning,"" she says. ""I didn't come all the way from Morocco and go through what I went through to get to the United States and say nothing."" Find other avenues to express your creativity. Soon the up-and-coming director found herself constrained by the time limitations of producing music videos. But reading the script for the movie ""Something New"" provided the outlet Hamri was looking for. She explains: ""I loved the idea of a woman who is an African- American woman who is having issues dating white males because she racially had an issue with that ... and the minute I started working on 'Something New' and I was doing my movie I realized, I was like 'I am a film director.'"" Always keep your aspirations in mind, no matter how lofty they may seem. Hamri's strong work ethic has seen her direct several Hollywood films and jaunts onto the sets of well-known TV shows like ""Desperate Housewives,"" ""Elementary"" and ""Grey's Anatomy."" Yet despite her silver screen success, she remains very much connected to her birthplace. ""I definitely want to create in Morocco as a base a very large studio that would be in competition with the big studios in Hollywood,"" she says. ""We would be able to go on location and stuff, but just really creating like the biggest entertainment hub in Africa."" READ THIS: The meteoric rise of Lupita Nyong'o .

"New York (CNN) -- What do the New York Giants and Jets have in common with Jimmy Hoffa? Not much, unless you buy into the long-festering urban legend that they all shared the same residence in East Rutherford, New Jersey. But now, the two football teams are headed to a new $1.6 billion facility nearby dubbed the New Meadowlands. And their departure may be the best opportunity to finally put to rest the endless stories that Hoffa is not ""swimming with the fishes"" in the swamps of New Jersey. Or is it? The old stadium, which opened in 1976 and is often referred to as Giants Stadium, is being razed, with demolition beginning Thursday. Urban lore has it that Hoffa, the long-missing Teamsters leader, was killed by members of organized crime and buried in the end zone, or thereabouts, in Giants Stadium. Representatives for the New Meadowlands stadium said that the field won't be dug up, but that the stadium will be torn down in large pieces and the land eventually will be a parking lot. Is it possible that football and soccer players -- not to mention the hundreds of thousands of fans who have visited the stadium for concerts over the years -- have trod near the former union leader? Few urban legends continue to capture the imagination like the disappearance of a union boss with a murky past. The story is now a traditional butt of comedians' jokes, and one shouldn't be surprised that in 2004, the show ""Mythbusters"" devoted a segment searching for Hoffa. Several areas of the field were tested, but nothing was found. Conclusive? Perhaps not. If you listen closely, you can hear Geraldo Rivera kicking himself for not doing an hourlong special. A Google search of ""Jimmy Hoffa"" reveals many theories and opinions on the whereabouts of the controversial union leader, who was reportedly last seen in a suburban Detroit restaurant. Hoffa skipped off to Brazil with a ""go-go dancer"" one union official swore. The Weekly World News claims NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has revealed Hoffa's body in a large hidden compartment with a special concrete block. ""Crushed in automobile compactor"" and ""Ground up at a meat processing plant and dumped in Florida"" are some of the other theories. Director Quentin Tarantino must be excited about the possibilities. So just how did Hoffa supposedly end up in the end zone of a football stadium in New Jersey? According to one account, his body was mixed into concrete that was later used to construct the stadium. But why does this story seem to resonate and remain one of the top theories? Jeff Hansen, an author and former Detroit police officer, says the rumors probably linger because the stadium is a well-known landmark. ""It's the NFL,"" he said. ""It's construction, organized crime and cement. Everyone wants to play on that."" Hansen did his own research, and in his recently released book ""Digging for the Truth: The Final Resting Place of Jimmy Hoffa,"" he says the union leader was probably killed closer to home in Michigan and disposed of in a crematorium. John Samerjan is vice president of public affairs at the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which oversees the Meadowlands Sports Complex. He says he's heard it all before, and he dismisses the story by saying, ""It's a complete urban myth."" ""There was this mob lore that the mob dumped bodies in the weeds before the stadium was built. The meadowlands region was 'the weeds.' No one has taken this seriously,"" he said. ""It would often come up because every so often, a mobster would write a book or a magazine article. I was here eight years ago when the calls came flooding in."" The rumor mill was so out of control then that a former publicity official recalled recently that the stadium posted a ""He's not here"" message on its electronic billboard outside the stadium. The FBI office in Detroit says the investigation of Hoffa's disappearance is ongoing. ""We follow up on leads,"" Detroit FBI spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold said. The FBI office in Newark, New Jersey, doesn't plan to send anyone to the stadium when it's torn down. ""Nope"" was the response from Newark FBI spokesman Brian Travers, who says he's fielded several recent calls from the media about the matter. ""My question to you,"" Travers replied about the seemingly lunacy of the question, ""is why would anyone think we would wait this long. We would have dug up the 50 yard line during the Super Bowl a long time ago if there was any credence to the rumor."" The issue of digging is very sensitive for New York sports fans. During the construction of the new Yankee Stadium, a construction worker, and Red Sox fan, buried a Red Sox jersey in wet concrete, hoping to hex the Yankees. The Yankees spent thousands of dollars to dig up the jersey and, in doing so, perhaps averted a future curse and urban legend. Superstitious? The Yankees won the 2009 World Series. CNN's Richard Roth contributed to this report.","Lore has it that Jimmy Hoffa's buried in the end zone, or thereabouts, in Giants Stadium .
With the stadium being razed, now may be the time to test the urban legend .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. military and its allies hit ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq this weekend. While the scope of the airstrikes was not yet clear, several targets were hit, and the strikes appear to have succeeded. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates assisted with attacks in Syria on Saturday and Sunday, including two near Dayr ar Zawr that destroyed an ISIS tank, one in northeast Syria that destroyed three armed vehicles and a Humvee and strikes on ""four (ISIS)-held modular refineries and an (ISIS) command and control node north of"" Raqqa, a U.S. Central Command news release said. ""Although we continue to assess the outcome of these attacks, initial indications are that they were successful,"" the statement said. In Iraq, fighter jets and drones conducted four airstrikes: one near Baghdad that destroyed an ISIS safehouse and damaged a checkpoint and three near Falluja that destroyed two ISIS checkpoints and a transport vehicle, U.S. Central Command said. U.S. splits emerge as Obama admits ISIS threat was misjudged . The fight for border city . But on the ground around the city of Kobani fierce battles raged between Kurdish forces and ISIS militants and were visible just across the border in Turkey on Saturday and Sunday. ISIS forces appeared to slowly gain territory in their offensive to take over the Kurdish city and solidify ISIS control over the Syrian border with Turkey. There have been several air strikes in the area, but eyewitnesses say the air strikes are too few and too far back from the front lines to slow the ISIS momentum. ""We need help. We need weapons. We need more effective airstrikes,"" Kobani official Idriss Nassan said. ""If the situation stays like this, we will see a massacre. I can't imagine what will happen if ISIS gets inside Kobani."" There was no word on casualties, but activists said the situation is growing more troubling, as power and water remain cut, food and basic supplies are running low and there is no humanitarian aid. Many residents had already left the city and have sought refuge in Turkey, officials aid. A CNN team on the Turkey-Syria border that witnessed some of the fighting said ISIS appeared to be pushing back toward Kobani's eastern front. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Istanbul Sunday, Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan said that airstrikes alone will not be enough to halt terrorist organizations. He said Turkey cannot remain outside the operation, signaling a change in his position towards cooperation. Turkey had been reluctant so far to support the coalition against ISIS. New al Qaeda message . The leader of Al Qaeda's franchise in Syria made his first public statement in eight months Sunday, vowing to fight the United States and it's allies. In a 25-minute audio recording Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, head of the al-Nusra militants, also warned his rebels not to accept intervention from the West in their own fight against ISIS. The two groups have been fighting since ISIS was disowned by al Qaeda's central command earlier this year. Al Qaeda offshoot leader killed? Also Sunday, the United States was working to confirm whether a leader of the Khorasan group was killed last week during an airstrike in Syria. The Khorasan group is an al Qaeda offshoot in Syria composed of what the U.S. says are ""seasoned"" terror operatives whose mission involves finding new ways to attack the United States and Europe. Though there were numerous reports that jihadists were offering condolences following the senior al Qaeda operative's death, White House Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told CNN on Sunday morning he can't confirm the reports. Blinken's remarks came as President Barack Obama, in an interview with ""60 Minutes"" set to air Sunday night, said Syria had become ""ground zero for jihadists around the world."" U.S. forces and Sunni tribes were able to weaken al Qaeda in Iraq, but rather than defeat AQI, they pushed the group underground, he said. ""Over the past couple of years, during the chaos of the Syrian civil war, where essentially you have huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned, they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos -- and attract foreign fighters, who believed in their jihadist nonsense and traveled everywhere from Europe to the United States to Australia to other parts of the Muslim world, converging on Syria,"" Obama said. The President also said the United States had underestimated ISIS' capabilities while overestimating the Iraqi military's will to fight. CNN's Talia Kayali, Gul Tuysuz, Antonia Mortenson, Ingrid Formanek , Salma Abdelaziz and Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","NEW: Turkey's President said his country cannot remain on the outside of ISIS fight .

"(CNN) -- He said he was little. And that turned out to be a big problem, according to prosecutors. Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia unsealed an indictment Friday accusing 45-year-old Eric C. Opitz of bilking Medicare out of more than $535,000 by claiming he was a dwarf who needed human growth hormone. In reality, according to the indictment, Opitz was 450 pounds and 6 feet, 3 inches. That's a nearly 1Â½ feet taller than what the support group Little People of America says is the cut-off for dwarfism. But for nearly a year, a pharmacy filled the physical trainer and body building consultant's prescriptions for as much as 8 milligrams of growth hormone per day -- 40 times the FDA's recommended maximum dose, according to prosecutors. Medicare footed the bill through a prescription drug benefit program, according to prosecutors. Opitz had claimed his only source of income was $950 a month in Social Security benefits, according to the indictment. So what did the big guy do with all that growth hormone -- which some athletes and bodybuilders use to increase muscle mass? He sold, it, prosecutors say, at something like $450 for each kit. He found his customers through a brazen ad on Craigslist, according to the indictment. Read the indictment . ""Do not wait, a lot in stock from pharmacy but it moves fast,"" Opitz wrote in the ad, according to the indictment. He got customers from all over the United States, but it turns out a handful were undercover investigators. Opitz was charged with health care fraud, mail fraud and illegal distribution of human growth hormones and anabolic steroids. Authorities arrested Opitz, then released him pending a detention hearing scheduled Friday afternoon, according to Patty Hartman, a public affairs specialist with the U.S. Attorney's Office. If convicted, prosecutors say Opitz faces ""substantial"" prison time.","NJ man who claimed to be a dwarf busted for allegedly selling growth hormone .

"ELLENDALE, North Dakota (CNN)  -- After surviving a near-fatal accident, Richard Olson recalls the doctor telling him, ""You may never walk again."" Bill Gross says he has put in $20,000 and 5,000 hours or more of volunteer time into Farm Rescue. The Ellendale, North Dakota, farmer had gotten caught in the power takeoff shaft of his farming equipment, and his injuries left him unable to plant his 2,500 acres of soybeans and corn. The accident might have meant the end of his family's farm. Enter Bill Gross and Farm Rescue. Since 2006, the successful UPS pilot has been, in his ""spare"" time, providing a helping hand and a hearty dose of hope for American family farmers like Olson. Through his nonprofit, Gross, 41, and volunteers assist farmers who have suffered a major illness, injury or natural disaster. Today, any of those crises can put an end to a farmer's livelihood. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of farms in America has decreased by 67 percent since 1910. Raised on a family farm in North Dakota, Gross says farms have changed since his childhood. ""Years ago, when there was an accident or an injury, neighbors would usually come and help each other,"" recalls Gross.

"(CNN) -- Hallie Twomey never imagined that a campaign to have her son's ashes scattered around the world would reach so far. On Monday, a portion of the ashes of 20-year-old C.J. are expected to be launched into space by a Houston company called Celestis, which has been sending cremated remains into Earth orbit, onto the lunar surface or into deep space since 1997. ""We didn't even know this was a possibility,"" Hallie Twomey said. ""When Celestis reached out to us we were literally blown away. We were very emotional when we found out not only that was this something that can happen but that the CEO was offering us a sort of complimentary ride into space."" Monday's launch of a SpaceLoft XL rocket carrying the ""Celestis cremation memorials"" of C.J. and others is scheduled to take place at New Mexico's Spaceport America. It will be the company's 13th launch, delivering remains to the weightlessness of space before returning them to Earth. The capsules with the ashes sealed inside are then presented to family members. C.J. family's will be watching a live-stream of the launch -- on the same day that a memorial tree will be planted at the hospital where he died. ""I foresee Monday being a day full of tears,"" Hallie Twomey said. For years, Hallie Twomey has struggled with the suicide of her son. She searched his belongings for a note with a clue of what tormented him. She sought counseling and attended support groups. Nothing seemed to help. But a plea initially to Facebook friends throughout the United States to help C.J. ""see the mountains that he never got to climb, see the vast oceans that he would have loved, see tropical beaches and lands far and away"" by scattering his ashes turned into an international effort. Strangers from India to Jamaica have spread his ashes in tribute to the young man's adventurous spirit. A separate Facebook page called ""Scattering CJ"" has more than 17,000 likes. ""How do you say 'Thank you' for that?"" his mother said shortly after starting her campaign late last year. ""It's been so much and so amazing but I'd give it all back if I could have C.J. ... I just wish I had him and none of this."" Still, the outpouring since her ""Scattering CJ"" page went up last November has been comforting. On Facebook, the pictures and videos chronicle the journey of C.J. ashes -- from the Grand Canyon to the Caribbean, from Australia to Morocco. ""Quite frankly, I spent the first two weeks doing nothing but crying,"" Twomey, of Auburn, Maine, said. ""I just wasn't prepared for what people were sharing and how somebody who has absolutely no connection to me could be affected."" Along with the ashes, Twomey sends a note and a small photo of C.J. in a Boston Red Sox T-shirt. His ashes have even been scattered at Fenway Park, home of his favorite team. His mother asks the recipient to think about her son and the people he helped through organ donation. She also asks that in their thoughts, they remind him that ""Mom and Dad love him, and that Mom is sorry."" Many of those scattering the ashes have also been affected by suicide or have outlived their children, she said. Twomey said she has regretted the argument she had with her son moments before he stormed out of their home and shot himself on April 15, 2010. ""C.J. and I fought terribly literally 2 seconds before he put a gun to his head and my last words to him were not nice,"" she said. ""I didn't tell him I loved him. I didn't hug him."" C.J. had been upset about not making an Air Force special forces team, his mother said. After being honorably discharged, he returned home. ""He seemed OK,"" she said. ""I didn't see any major life changes or severe depression."" More than 800 packets, each containing a small portion of ashes, have gone out so far, with 9,000 people offering to extend C.J.'s journey. She has spent at least $3,000 on postage, Twomey said. She mails 25 to 50 packets a week. ""We are humbled every single day at the kindness of strangers,"" Hallie Twomey said. ""I cannot think of a person more perfect to reach outer space. I believe C.J. would be thrilled with this attention."" National Suicide Prevention Lifeline .

"(CNN) -- Here's one from the obvious file: There's no ""magic wand"" that -- poof! -- creates jobs in the United States, or anywhere else. In response to my column this week on long-term unemployment, some of you commented that the president doesn't have superpowers to create jobs for the rest of us. Or you pointed out that he should be part in the process -- but job-creation is actually something Congress or business leaders should take on instead. I thought those were great points. Here's my favorite comment -- mostly because it uses the term ""pea brain"" (and yes, it's in reference to me, but you've gotta love a nerdy insult, especially when it includes a vegetable): . ""Are you so stupid that you think the President just waves his magic wand and jobs are created? Let me give you a lesson in government Sutter. Maybe your pathetic conservative pea brain will be able to grasp one fact: The President proposes and Congress legislates. So it is the Republican Congress that is keeping that poor woman unemployed. They have done nothing to aleviate (sic) her plight ..."" The ""poor woman"" the commenter, who used the screen name ""tom sellier,"" referenced is Kim Peters, an unemployed mom who invited me into her home Tuesday to watch the State of the Union. Overall, Peters, who has been unemployed on and off for five years, didn't take much comfort from the speech. She's more worried about keeping a roof over her head. Some of the most cutting things Peters had to say focused on House Speaker John Boehner, whose apparent indifference toward the State of the Union -- scowling, licking his lips, looking very ""get me outta here"" -- made her angry. Her point of view, and I think there is some merit to this, is that President Obama wants to promote infrastructure projects and other ""stimulus"" efforts that would create jobs, but Republicans are so focused on the deficit they won't consider spending money on that. She wasn't thrilled with everything Obama said either. Drafting public policy that will create jobs and put people back to work is a tricky thing. That's part of the reason I argued the first and easiest thing we all can do to help the long-term unemployed is to treat them as equal humans. Currently, they're some of the most maligned people in our society. Companies put out ads saying they only will consider employed candidates. Recruiters toss their resumes before taking a look. Generally, I think the national sentiment is that unemployed people must have done something wrong to end up jobless. As a person who's been laid off before, I can tell you that's not always the case. It's unfair to give unemployed people less of a chance at getting back on their feet. If anything, I think they deserve more consideration. It's the fair thing to do. Other readers said getting a job is an individual's responsibility. ""I've been unemployed and it sucks . . . BUT you do whatever you have to to get work you dig ditches, you wash dishes, empty trash, you may even have to move your home,"" wrote mikemc58. ""Point is you have to think outside the box and get out of your comfort zone. Wishes and dreams aren't going to do it. Get off your butt hit the streets everyday asking, looking, volunteering, for a job. And listening to Obama drone on about how good the economy is useless, because as we all know, 'we' who live in the REAL world know it's NOT. GOV is not the answer, personal responsibility and self motivation is the key to finding new work."" That's another fair point, although I think individual effort only goes so far when there are 3.4 unemployed workers for every job opening in the United States in December, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And it's important to empathize with people who become stuck in a cycle of hopelessness and depression the longer their unemployment continues. That's not an easy cycle to break. One more thing to bring up about the comments: While many of you wrote in to ask how you can help long-term unemployed people get back on their feet, several of you attacked Peters -- criticizing her ownership of a TV, saying she shouldn't have cable if she doesn't have a job (she actually doesn't have cable, but that's beside the point) and speculating about what type of cell phone she uses. What silliness, right? And it speaks to the underlying problem here: We're inclined to attack unemployed people -- to judge their financial situations and to speculate about what might have put them out of work. That's unhelpful. And discriminatory. Peters, the woman I featured, told me that ending ignorance will help end unemployment. Government and business leaders must help, too. But I think she's right: a simple shift in attitude -- trading ignorance for empathy -- can and will make a huge difference. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Commenter: ""You think the President just waves his magic wand and jobs are created?""
John Sutter: Congress, the president and all of us can help .
Sutter: The long-term unemployed encounter widespread discrimination .

"(CNN) -- Get ready for bone-chilling cold you probably haven't endured in years. A deep freeze is spreading across much of the United States this weekend, making the nor'easter that just blanketed about 20 states with snow look like a mere curtain raiser. 8 tips to ease winter travel woes . Sunday temperatures are expected to hit 30 degrees below zero in North Dakota and other sections of the Plains and Midwest; the wind chill will make it feel like minus 50, the National Weather Service said. By Wednesday, nearly half the nation -- 140 million people -- will shiver in temperatures of zero or lower. The arctic blast threatens to sweep subzero lows as far south as Alabama and plunge much of the Deep South into the single digits. Winter weather in the past week has claimed at least 13 lives, CNN has confirmed. Eleven people died in road accidents -- including one man crushed as he was moving street salt with a forklift. A man in Wisconsin died of hypothermia. And in Byron, New York, a 71-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease wandered away from her home Thursday night and was found dead in the snow in a wooded area about 100 yards away. in Chicago, a plane headed to Las Vegas slid off the taxiway at O'Hare International Airport on Saturday night. None of the customers on Spirit Flight 245 were injured, said Misty Pinson, director of corporate communications for Spirit. Opening act . The cold blast burst onto the stage in the Northern Plains States early Saturday, hurling North Dakota into below-zero territory. Minnesota has already closed schools on Monday. ""I have made this decision to protect all our children from the dangerously cold temperatures,"" Gov. Mark Dayton said. People in the town of town of Embarrass, Minnesota, say they may break their cold temperature record of 64 below, set in 1996. ""I've got a thermometer from the weather service that goes to 100 below,"" resident Richard Fowlei told CNN affiliate KQDS. ""If it gets that cold I don't want to be here."" Chicago native Leo Londono, 30, said this is the harshest winter he's experienced in the city. From his apartment, he can see large chunks of ice floating on Lake Michigan. ""It's so cold you don't want to step outside,"" he said. ""There's wind chill. And then this huge Arctic air blast is supposed to come through and I don't want to even leave my home."" The low temperatures and wind chill are a recipe for rapid frostbite or hypothermia. A 66-year-old man died of hypothermia in Milwaukee on Friday, the medical examiner's office said. The weather service's Twin Cities, Minnesota, office warns, ""Exposed flesh can freeze in as little as five minutes with wind chills colder than 50 below."" This system will produce ""the coldest air in two decades,"" the service said. The danger of injury and death from the cold will spread with the cold front into the Midwest by Monday night. Power outages were not as widespread despite blizzard-level winds in some places when the nor'easter passed through in the last few days. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence encouraged residents to do more than check on friends and relatives. ""In preparation for the inclement weather, I encourage Hoosiers to assemble an emergency preparedness kit with plenty of non-perishable food and water, fill any necessary prescriptions, ensure they have a safe heating source, avoid unnecessary travel and be careful if they must be outside."" he said. Upper Midwest . Sunday night in Chicago will see a shivering 16 to 20 below zero and -- once you factor in the Windy City's stiff breeze -- a chill of 35 below to 45 below zero. Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, is unfortunately not a domed stadium. Fans and players there will be outdoors and brave temperatures approaching minus 20 as the Packers battle the San Francisco 49ers for a chance to advance to the Super Bowl. Some sportswriters speculated that it may go down in the record books as the coldest football game ever played. The Packers organization and a stadium vending company will serve free hot chocolate and coffee to help fans withstand the deep freeze. As Packers head coach Mike McCarthy said Friday: ""This is not the norm."" That's is not the only game where fans will brave the freeze. On Saturday in Philadelphia, the hometown Eagles hosted the New Orleans Saints in a playoff game. Temperatures were in the mid-20s at kickoff. Marching on . As the arctic cold conquers about half of the continental United States, temperatures are forecast to dip into the minus teens through the lower Midwest. Snow will cover swaths from the Plains to the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys, all the way to New England. Parts of the Midwest could see temperatures not recorded in 15 to 20 years -- for a painful couple of days. Even areas as far south as Nashville could be frozen solid in zero-degree cold as the arctic air mass dives southward at the beginning of next week. Flight madness . Thousands were stuck at airports nationwide Friday because of systemwide delays -- though at least they are not out in the frigid cold. Lesley Ryland tried to get home to England after attending her son's wedding in Kentucky. ""I was supposed to fly from Kentucky/Louisville up to New York, but flights have been canceled at New York, so instead I've come here,"" Ryland told CBS Atlanta, a CNN affiliate. ""Hopefully tonight, I'll get a transfer from here back over to London."" FlightAware.com, which tracks cancellations due to weather and mechanical problems, said about 3,200 flights were canceled Friday within, into or out of the United States. Expect more of the same in the coming days. At 10 p.m. Saturday, 1,391 flights had been canceled. About 760 Sunday flights have already been called off. Though the temperature in Las Vegas was 52 degrees -- above zero -- passengers there were also feeling the winter's sting Friday. Long lines formed inside McCarran International Airport at the counters for Southwest Airlines, which had canceled many of its flights to and from Chicago. The airline carries 40% of Las Vegas' passengers, according to Chris Hayes, an airport spokesman. CNN's Joe Sutton and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.","NEW: Plane slides off taxiway in Chicago; nobody hurt .

"(CNN) -- When iReporter Carlos Ortega evacuated Galveston's West End  last week, there was a road, a row of houses and about 150 feet of sand between his house and the water. Now the surf laps about 30 feet from his door. iReporter Carlos Ortega says there's ""not an inch that isn't damaged"" in his Galveston, Texas, neighborhood. Hurricane Ike devastated the Texas city over the weekend, and Gov. Rick Perry said it could be weeks before residents could return. ""There's substantial structural damage, obviously ...

He said one beachfront house was knocked off its stilts and was lying on the ground like an amusement park funhouse. A dead cow washed in front of another home. ""It was pretty depressing and devastating to see how everything was just torn up,"" he said. ""People's lives and houses were just torn up."" All but two of the houses on the ""front row,"" nearest the beach, in their Bermuda Beach subdivision were destroyed, he said. ""You wouldn't know there was a house there."" ""The house across the street from us is completely gone, and there's no trace of it,"" he said. The first floor of their house is covered with 3 to 4 feet of sand and debris, including huge chunks of asphalt from the road that ran in front of the house. ""We don't keep anything of value down there,"" he said, because people expect to get high water occasionally. There were some windows out on the second level, but they did not have much water damage.

Nearly 2,000 people who did not evacuate have been rescued along the southeastern Texas coast, said Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Office of Homeland Security. On Sunday, a Galveston County sheriff's official said three bodies were pulled from storm wreckage in Port Bolivar, bringing to 10 the number of reported deaths in Texas linked to Ike.

"London, England (CNN) -- An interview with a Swedish footballer playing in his home country's fourth tier usually only engages the interest of the most parochial of soccer fans, but when Anton Hysen agreed to speak to a local magazine last month, it unexpectedly created headlines from Brazil to China. The 20-year old midfielder -- a former under-17 Swedish international now playing for Utsiktens BK of Gothenburg, a team that rarely attracts crowds of more than a few hundred -- made history as well as headlines. ""I am a footballer and [I am] gay. If I perform as a footballer, then I do not think it matters if I like girls or boys,"" he told Swedish football magazine Offside. In a heartbeat Hysen became the world's only current professional footballer to go public on being gay, breaking the game's last taboo. Homosexuality in professional sport remains a controversial issue. But as attitudes have changed, sportsmen and women like Martina Navratilova, arguably the greatest women's tennis player of all time, to basketball's John Amaechi, have publicly announced their sexuality despite the pressure from both the locker room and the prejudice of fans. Yet whilst tennis, basketball, cricket and even rugby union have acknowledged the presence of gay players, football has been oddly, and stubbornly, resistant. Even in the past six months, for every Mario Gomez or Manuel Neur -- two German internationals who have urged gay players to go public -- there's a Vlatko Markovic, the head of the Croatian Football Federation, who told Croat newspaper Vercernji List that: ""While I'm president of the Croatian Football Federation, there will be no homosexuals playing in the national team ... thankfully only normal people play football."" And FIFA president Sepp Blatter was caught out too when he joked that gay supporters should refrain from having sex at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Homosexuality is illegal in the emirate.  Football lags behind . But why is it that soccer, which has waged a largely successfully battle against racism and sexism in western Europe, remains one of the few bastions of homophobia in sport? The answer according to the ""Justin Campaign"" -- a group that campaigns for more tolerance for homosexuality in football -- is the fear of reprisals from fans. ""Football, with its roots in working-class male culture, has always had a far more aggressive and vocal support,"" explains spokesman Alan Duffy. ""That's not to say that middle class people aren't racist or homophobic. Simply that often they will keep their views to themselves. Footballers receive crowd abuse for everything and anything. Fans now know not to openly express racist views at grounds. We need to get to a stage where they know that homophobic chanting is unacceptable too."" The campaign is named after the only other professional footballer, aside from Anton Hysen, who went public about their sexuality. Fashanu was a promising young English striker who in 1981 became Britain's first £1 million ($1.6 million)black player when he signed for then-European Cup winners Nottingham Forest. In 1990 he came out after a British newspaper planned to run an expose of Fashanu's affair with a politician. But according to gay activist and friend Peter Tatchell, the pressure of leading a double life, coupled later with the abuse he received from supporters everywhere he played, left an indelible mark. ""During that decade of closeted double life he found it immensely difficult to cope with the strain of hiding his gayness in the macho world of football,"" he recalled. ""Justin suffered racism too ... they would make monkey noises and gestures, and throw bananas on the pitch. But it was the anti-gay prejudice that ultimately dragged him down."" Fashanu never fulfilled his potential and drifted down the divisions. In 1998, after falsely believing that a warrant had been issued for his arrest in the U.S. following allegations of a sexual assault, Fashanu hanged himself. He was 37 years old. According to the Justin Campaign, the experiences of Fashanu, and the vitriol it unleashed, has made it harder to persuade high-profile footballers to come out. Only last year, the English Football Association (FA) delayed the launch of a viral video tackling the issue of homophobia in the game when it emerged that every footballer and agent the FA approached had declined to endorse it. ""I suspect agents and clubs shied away from it,"" Peter Clayton, chair of the FA's Homophobia in Football advisory group, told British newspaper the Daily Mail. ""A player coming forward to appear in it would feel he might ignite more vitriol.""  Agents or fans? Indeed, new research has suggested that it is the football clubs and football agents themselves, rather than the fans, that might be the real barrier to players coming out. Dr Ellis Cashmore, professor of culture media and sport at Staffordshire University, conducted an anonymous survey of over 3,000 fans and footballers, and discovered that 91% believed that only a player's performance on the pitch mattered, whilst just 9% believed that a player's sexuality posed a problem. ""Before we did the research the big homophobia barrier was fans and the players didn't want to confront hostile fans,"" Dr Cashmore told CNN. ""But they [the fans surveyed] said that they thought it was the clubs, because no clubs want to take a risk because they feel it will hurt the brand of the club."" It was sentiment echoed by Max Clifford, a UK media impresario who last year revealed that he represented two gay Premier League footballers but urged them to stay in the closet. ""Do I think it's right? Of course not ... It's a very sad state of affairs. But it's a fact that homophobia in football is as strong now as 10 years ago."" Dr. Cashmore agrees. ""They [football clubs and agents] have read Max Clifford's remarks. Agents make money from commission. Agents will ask players: 'We have $6.5 million in endorsement contracts, would it damage your reputation [to come out]?' It's how they think about this. By nature they are cautious. You have two conservative forces here. Clubs who are institutions and agents who want to protect their own income streams. Many of them reluctantly concede that perception."" The English FA believes it is now on the right track when it comes to dealing with homophobic abuse, perhaps even setting the stage for a footballer to follow Anton Hysen. ""The FA is communicating with experts in tackling homophobia on a regular basis ...there is an FA strategy in place to implement those over the next 12 months and beyond,"" explained the FA's Matt Phillips. The next Hysen? Some, like Dr. Cashmore, believe that far from being a barrier to earning money, an openly gay player would be able to significantly raise their profile, an experience borne out by the interest in Anton Hysen's story. But even with the changing attitudes in society, gay footballers still look as much to the experiences of Fashanu as Hysen. ""Would a player face the same vitriol as Justin? It's hard to say,"" said Duffy. ""He may well do. But there would be also many many more words of encouragement. Something that would help and something that Justin didn't get, unfortunately.""","Anton Hysen, a fourth division Swedish footballer, recently declared he was gay .

"(CNN) -- The president of Paris Saint-Germain says fans of the French club have overcome initial reservations about their new Qatari owners and have bought into their mission to make PSG the biggest team in the world. Nasser Al-Khelaifi told CNN World Sport that his vision for the club centers around attracting the finest players on the planet to ply their trade in the French capital and turning PSG into a profitable enterprise. Currently led by former AC Milan and Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti, PSG are in contention to win their first Ligue 1 title since 1994 and are close to securing their dream of competing in the European Champions League. So can PSG conquer the footballing world and become as big as Spanish and European champions Barcelona? Arsenal back coach Wenger as club post profits of $78m . ""This is our strategy to bring PSG on long term to be one of the biggest in the world,"" he told World Sport anchor Pedro Pinto. ""We are not saying we are going to be the best club in the world, because it's really tough; you've got history behind other clubs in the (English) Premier League or Spanish or Italian leagues so we are going to try and make it. ""For us, of course, with the passion of football you know we love football, we love Paris. Paris is a great city and it's really that Paris deserved to have a big club in the world and that's why we came to Paris and bought PSG. ""In the beginning some of the people for sure, they were against us but now I believe most of them or all of them they are with us, supporting us and PSG. Honestly I am so proud today of where we are."" Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani bought a 70% share of PSG through his Qatar Sports Investments company in June 2011 and installed 38-year-old Al-Khelaifi as president.

Ronaldo backheel keeps Real 10 points clear in Spain . Another signal of the club's intent to make waves in Europe came with their failed pursuits of Manchester City's Argentina striker Carlos Tevez and former Manchester United and Real Madrid star David Beckham. But despite the vast sums of money being spent, Al-Khelaifi insists it is a long-term target of PSG to make the club profitable, and recruit players from the pool of young talent available in the French capital. ""That is our strategy,"" he said. ""In five years we want to make money -- also you know we love football, we came to Paris as I said to be one of the biggest clubs in Europe. ""You know, our advantage for sure it's Paris, it's the capital, twelve million people live in and around Paris, you have got a lot of talented kids around Paris. ""You know the best French players come from Paris. If you see Thierry Henry, (Lilian) Thuram, Nicolas Anelka you know it's really worth it to look for them and look for the new (Lionel) Messi. Why not from Paris?"" But for now, the immediate target is to end the club's 18-year wait for the French league title, and the lucrative rewards it would deliver in terms of a Champions League place. ""It's going to be great in this stadium to see us playing against Barcelona or Real Madrid,"" Al-Khelaifi said.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has made it clear to Congress that if they will not work with him he will work around them. Before the State of the Union address, the president announced that he was increasing the minimum wage for workers under federal contract to $10.10 an hour. During the State of the Union, ""wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do."" Republicans predictably complained. Some warned that the president was embracing an unconstitutional set of tools that would violate the laws of the land. ""We don't have a monarchy in this country,"" warned Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, ""there's an executive branch and the legislative branch, and the president has to work with Congress to get things done."" Though Obama has been far more timid in using executive power than President George W. Bush, many in the GOP suddenly have a legal problem with presidents going their own way. Most experts agree that what the president has done is squarely within the prerogatives accorded to presidents. There is a long history of presidents using executive power ever since the founding of the nation. The power of the office grew enormously over the course of the 20th century and presidents became increasingly comfortable using mechanisms such as signing statements and executive orders to achieve their goals. In December 1980, President Jimmy Carter used an executive order to protect 56 million acres of Alaskan wilderness from mining and logging. President Ronald Reagan used executive power to weaken federal agencies that were responsible for policies he opposed. President Bill Clinton used an executive order in 1995 to prevent the federal government from entering into contracts with companies that hired strike-breakers. In 2001, Bush enraged many Democrats when he restricted public access to the papers of former presidents. He also overturned many environmental regulations that Clinton had put into place. Environmentalists complained. Following the revelation of how many signing statements -- attachments to a bill in which a president can express concerns about sections that he believes to be unconstitutional -- Bush had used, Rep. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, explained that what the president was saying is ""Congress, what you do isn't really important; I'm going to do what I want to do."" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, defended Bush, stating, ""It is precedented and it's not new."" Obama has lagged behind most presidents in making full use of his office. The average for number of executive orders for presidents since 1900 is 44 per year. Obama has averaged 37 executive orders -- less than Republican Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. But just because the president can take executive action, is it a good idea to do so? There are good reasons that Democrats should be leery about using presidential power to achieve their ends. Most important, the executive orders put into place by one president can be easily and quickly overturned by the next president. Killing policies that are put into place by Obama would not be extraordinarily difficult nor would it require the kind of long, protracted struggle that Republicans have engaged in with Obamacare, thus far unsuccessfully. When Clinton came into office in 1993, he reversed Reagan's executive order from 1984 that prohibited the use of federal funds to advocate abortion. In 2009, Obama revoked Bush's order restricting public access to presidential papers. Presidential power also deprives a policy of the fierce public debate and congressional vote that comes with legislation. Although the process of passing bills through Congress is usually very painful for a president, if successful a policy obtains a kind of legitimacy that rarely comes from executive action. This is evident from how durable the programs from the New Deal and Great Society, such as Social Security, the Civil Rights Act, and Medicare and Medicaid have been over time. Through legislative debate, supporters of a bill are forced to present their case and to persuade a sufficient number of representatives and senators to come to their side. Sometimes a president from one party can persuade some members from the opposition to vote for a bill, permanently putting their imprint on the policy. This was a powerful part of why the Civil Rights Act of 1964 gained such widespread legitimacy throughout the nation. Even when opponents lose, they are given their chance to say no and to explain to the public why they oppose an idea. By contrast, the process of issuing executive orders opens up policies to charges of illegitimacy in a way that are much more difficult to sell with laws passed by Congress. Equally important for a president, legislators go must go on record. When they do so in support of a bill the legislator becomes much more invested in the coming years in defending that decision. Opponents go on record as well, and when a policy turns out to be popular and successful this makes them much more hesitant to continue their attacks on a program. For decades, Republicans shied away from the kind of oppositional statements toward Medicare proposals uttered by Barry Goldwater and Reagan in the early 1960s for fear that voters would remember how they had stood firm against benefits that turned out to be enormously popular. Obama certainly would prefer to obtain legislation and the turn to executive power is a decision of last resort, one that realistically might be the only way he can achieve anything else in the next few years. But the strategy will come with some significant costs and Obama's legacy will remain fragile and vulnerable in the coming years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: President Obama promising to take action even though his agenda stalled in Congress .

"(CNN) -- Several women who publicly supported a campaign to defy Saudi Arabia's de facto ban on women driving fear they are being followed and investigated by the country's secret police. The women, who requested anonymity due to their concerns for their safety, described to CNN Monday how they'd been ""followed by cars filled with men since Saturday,"" when dozens of women across the kingdom participated in the October 26 Women's Driving Campaign. At least five women said vehicles had been parked outside their houses since Saturday. ""I don't know for sure if it is secret police or just men trying to harass us because we want the right to drive, but they are trying to intimidate us,"" said one woman. ""I'm positive I'm being followed by the secret police since Saturday,"" said another, who added she'd gotten no official word she was being investigated. Over the weekend, in an extraordinary act of civil disobedience, at least 41 women got behind the wheel and drove on the streets of various Saudi cities. Many filmed themselves and uploaded those videos to YouTube. Now, several of them say the euphoria of that moment has quickly turned to worry over what might happen to them next. Many wonder if they'll be punished for hitting the open road in such a closed society. While no formal law exists in Saudi Arabia specifically barring women from driving, religious edicts are often interpreted there to mean it is illegal for females to do so. Other Saudi women have been penalized in the past for defying the ban. In 1990, a group of 47 women protested the prohibition by driving through the streets of Riyadh, the country's capital. After being arrested, many lost their jobs and were placed under a travel ban. In 2011, women's rights activist Manal Al-Sharif spent nine days in jail for posting online a video of herself driving. Adding to their fears, the women say, is the detention of a man who worked closely with the campaign. They say Tariq Al-Mubarak, a columnist and teacher, was called in for questioning by the Bureau of Investigation and Prosecution in Riyadh on Sunday and has not been released yet. Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry would neither confirm nor deny if Al-Mubarak was being held. Reached via text message, Maj. Gen. Mansour Al-Turki, the Interior Ministry's spokesman, responded to CNN, saying, ""as far as I know, the Bureau of Investigation (BIP) doesn't detain anybody, but they could call people for questioning or interrogation."" Despite repeated attempts, CNN was unable to reach the BIP for comment and was told by Al-Turki that the agency has no spokesperson. When asked if Saudi women who participated in or supported the women's driving campaign were being targeted, followed or investigated, Al-Turki told CNN, ""I don't understand the reason to follow anybody. If we have anything against anyone we would act according to the laws."" One woman, whose worry is growing by the hour, said participants in the movement only wanted to ""emphasize to the Saudi government that this campaign is not a challenge to the Saudi government."" She described the campaign, which has gained serious momentum since it was first announced in late September, as ""just following up on King Abdullah and other officials' words in the past that the women's driving issue is one for society to decide."" ""We just want to be allowed to drive our own cars,"" she said. Saudi Arabia is still very much split over the question of women driving, with many women there supporting not just the driving ban, but also in favor of the conservative kingdom's guardianship system, which mandates that Saudi women cannot go to school, get a job or even travel without permission from their male guardians. Asked about the issue at a regular briefing Monday, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department voiced support for Saudi women's ""ability to drive."" ""We support, of course, the right of women everywhere to make their own decisions about their lives and their futures, and the right to benefit equally from public services and protection from discrimination,"" said Jen Psaki, the spokeswoman. ""We support the full inclusion of women in Saudi society."" She said that the Unites States raises ""human rights issues, equal rights issues, frequently with the Saudi government.""","NEW: U.S. supports women's ""ability to drive,"" State Department official says .

"(CNN) -- An election-year Democratic measure designed to ensure that women don't face pay discrimination was blocked Tuesday by Republicans who complained that the bill was politically inspired and would reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers. The motion, which needed 60 votes to succeed, got only 52, not one from a Republican. President Obama issued a statement criticizing Republicans for putting ""partisan politics ahead of American women and families."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, standing at a news conference with pay equity advocate Lilly Ledbetter, accused Republicans of ""wanting to stick their heads in the sand"" about the longstanding issue of women being paid less than men. ""But it's clear where Democrats stand,"" Reid said. The bill, which Democrats said would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, would require employers to prove that differences in pay were related to job performance, not gender; would prevent employers from forbidding employees from sharing salary information with each other; and would allow women who believe they were discriminated against to sue for damages. Democrats acknowledged privately that they expected to make political gains with women by pressing to close the pay gap, which they said has women earning just 77 cents on the dollar compared with men. Republicans, fearful that Democrats were trying to portray them as insensitive to women, argued that they oppose pay discrimination but disagree with the Democrats' bill, which was written without their input. Republicans remained largely silent about the issue in the days leading up to the vote, even as Democrats, led by the president, made an all-out push for the legislation. Only one Republican senator, Dean Heller of Nevada, who is in a tight re-election race against Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley, spoke on the floor against the bill. In his brief speech, Heller proposed an alternative bill to combat the problem, but Democrats criticized it as insufficient. Off the floor, a few Republicans spoke about the bill, but only when asked by reporters. ""We think it is the wrong way of going about dealing with this issue,"" said Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, who described the measure as a reward for pro-Democratic trial lawyers. ""This is just politics. This should be called the trial lawyers bonanza bill,"" complained Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming, the top Republican on the Senate labor committee. ""It has nothing to do with the women. They will get very little out of it. What it allows is huge class-action suits with very little defense by any employer."" Even the retiring moderate Republican senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, whose support Democrats hoped to win, called the Democrats' bill ""regrettable"" and an ""overreach."" ""I think there are other ways (of) addressing these issues, and this legislation goes too far,"" Snow said. The bill ""would put a tremendous burden on employers through lawsuits, class-action lawsuits."" Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, the chief sponsor of the pay equity bill, vowed to return to the bill until it passes. ""We will be back,"" she said. ""Though we lost the vote today, we are not giving up for equal pay, for equal rights.""","Democrats say bill would ensure that women don't face pay discrimination .

"(CNN) -- How is it possible that America has not managed to come together and build an effective response to gun massacres? How can that be? If another country had sent a killer who massacred people at random in the streets of an American city, Congress would have rushed to emergency session and the public would have thrown its support behind forceful action. Politicians, news media, community groups, everyone would be working in solidarity to combat the evil facing the nation. Just imagine if it happened again and again. In Isla Vista, California, a mass killing has shaken the nation. But every time we hear of another gunman's rampage, Americans go straight into their comfort zone. For a few days, advocates of gun rights stiffen their spines and vehemently defend their turf. On the other side, gun control advocates brandish their arguments while relatives of the latest victims cry out in pain and despair. The discussion combusts and burns itself off with the usual ingredients: Is the problem too many guns? Is it mental health? Is it guns in the hands of the wrong people? Yes, yes, yes to all of the above. Each killing spree triggers other discussions. Is it hatred for women, a breakdown of societal norms, too many video games, violence in movies? By all means we should study, debate and analyze the many factors that contribute to violence. But first, it's time to take the urgent action needed to stanch the bleeding, to at least slow the hemorrhage. Opinion: I'm a gun owner and I want gun control . How can a country become accustomed to the idea that children may go to school one morning and never come home? It happens over and over and over again. How can it become routine that anyone, anywhere, for no reason at all, can get killed by a mentally disturbed person? At times, the entire country's response to the endless stream of killings resembles the embarrassing stagnation of politicians in Washington. Each side self-righteously preaches, firing up its own supporters, and nothing changes. Politicians, by the way, have become useless in tackling the crisis. Talking about guns is too risky. In 1999, when two killers massacred more than a dozen, mostly teenagers, at Columbine High School, the entire world was in shock. Since then, the shootings have kept coming. At Virginia Tech campus, 32 people were killed. In Aurora, Colorado, 12 people were shot dead, 70 were injured. At Sandy Hook Elementary School, 20 children and six staff members were killed. At a parking lot in Tuscon, Arizona, a congresswoman was shot in the head. Luckily, she survived, but others nearby were killed. There are two common denominators: guns and mental illness. Can Americans set aside their differences and try to work out an agreement that will address this crisis? Can the two sides recognize the sorrow and pain that are spreading as they shout past one another? Gun enthusiasts don't support mass murder. Nobody does. That's the fundamental common ground. Can we have a moment to set aside strategic long-term political objectives -- just a brief interlude -- and work together to try to prevent more people with mental illness from arming themselves and killing the innocent? Here's what I suggest. Might the NRA, with all its political power, announce it is willing to speak with mental health specialists, law enforcement officials and gun control advocates to focus sharply on just this issue? Hold a summit, form a high-level committee, take the first step on the road to a solution. Consider a few recent killing sprees. The Sandy Hook killer had serious mental health issues. The man who shot Rep. Gabby Giffords had dropped out of school after his college required a mental health evaluation. The Virginia Tech killer had been investigated by the university for stalking and had been declared mentally ill by a Virginia special justice. The Isla Vista shooter also had a history of mental illness. Like many others mass shooters, he had given clear signs that he was extremely dangerous, planning to kill. He had had several encounters with police. His family had alerted the police to the danger. Still, like all the other mass shooters before him, he was able to build an arsenal as he planned his rampage. Things must change. The threshold for taking someone against their will for psychiatric evaluation needs to be lowered. Police need better mental health training. It must become easier to intervene when there are risks. Importantly, people who have mental illnesses that put them at risk of violence should be blocked from owning weapons. Does anyone, even the most avid hunter, the most passionate gun enthusiast, think mentally ill people should be allowed to own semi-automatic weapons, or any weapons at all, for that matter? Opinion: Let teens talk about mental illness . Beyond the area of mental health, there is much to be debated about whether a free society requires that its citizens be allowed to arm themselves so thoroughly, and whether an armed population makes for more or less crime. The United States can learn from the experience of other countries where people maintain wide-ranging rights to carry weapons, but have taken measures that effectively brought an end to gun massacres. Everyone is at risk now, people in every ZIP code, in every income level, of every race. A loved one could die in a random shooting out on the street or in a temple or a movie theater; in a country club, or on a college campus. No one can honestly deny that it is a real crisis. America can take steps to start fixing this problem. Gun lovers and gun control advocates can come together and craft a solution. Show Washington that it can be done. Show the world that America has the power to solve an urgent problem.","Frida Ghitis: Gun rampages, like the one in Isla Vista, have become routine .
