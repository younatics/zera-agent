Gobsmacked: Jamie O'Connell had to look twice after spotting the obscene hand gesture in the sky . The National Lottery's 'It Could Be You' advertising campaign was one of the most recognisable of its time, where a cloud formed the shape of a hand and pointed to an unsuspecting winner. The cloud's over Fort William in Scotland came up with their own take on the idea, when they formed the shape of a hand and made the sort of gesture that suggested its photographer, Jamie O'Connell, probably need not bother buying a ticket this week. Mr O’Connell was walking his dog along the Caledonian Canal near Neptune’s Staircase when the cloud well and truly gave him the finger. The 23-year-old had to look twice to make sure he wasn’t imagining the rude hand gesture. Mr O'Connell, an offshore steward, said: 'I was just walking the dog when I looked up and saw this cloud. 'I was absolutely gobsmacked. I had to double look at it, and I nearly wet myself. 'A lot of people have said it might be a sign - I must have annoyed someone!' The cloud, which broke through a rainy sky, has become a viral sensation since being Mr O'Connell posted it online. It's you: Daniel O'Connell was amazed when he spotted this offensive cloud formation in the skies above Fort William . He said: 'It’s so lifelike, it’s hard to believe it’s actually a cloud. It really looks like someone swearing, the detail is unbelievable. 'I think I’ve seen clouds that look a bit like dinosaurs in the past, but no-one has ever flipped off at me through the sky.' He is now keeping a close eye on the clouds in the hope he will be able to spot other lifelike figures. He added: 'I’ve always wanted to see Mufassa from The Lion King. He’s been my favourite film character since I was younger. It’s the best film of all time.'","Man who spotted obscene gesture in the clouds 'absolutely gobsmacked'

Fish faux-pas: Venezuelan president Nicholas Maduro muddled the word for 'fish' with 'penises' Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro appeared to make a mistake of Biblical proportions this week - when he muddled a well-known religious quote and said Christ multiplied loaves and 'penises'. Maduro made the unfortunate error during a speech on education at the Miranda stadium, in the country’s capital, Caracas. Referring to the iconic story of when Christ multiplied fish and loaves to feed the populace, Maduro said his government would help expand education in the country, 'school by school, child by child, high . school by high school, community by community — to embed ourselves in . there. 'To multiply ourselves like Christ multiplied the penises — sorry, . the fish — and the bread.' The Spanish word for 'penises' (penes) is just one letter away from the word for 'fish' (peces). The Venezuelan premier, who was dressed in a bright red, blue and yellow Adidas track suit - to reflect the colours of the national flag - immediately sparked a storm among Twitter users. Sofy Cortez wrote: 'Hahaha so I just read about Nicolas Maduro's speech and Christ did what?!?!? He multiplied ""penises""?!?!? God bless!' Another user, LayNG, wrote: 'Panes + Peces = PENES #EpicFail @NicolasMaduro'. Maduro took over as interim president of Venezuela following the death of Hugo Chavez on March 5. He later won an election against the opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. Despite only being in power for five months, Maduro has courted controversy on more than one occasion. He has been blamed for a toilet paper shortage throughout the country, apparently slept in Chavez's mausoleum, has made a number of anti-gay slurs and offered asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden. Maduro also made a lingual faux pas earlier this month when, according to the Latin Times, he incorrectly pronounced the Spanish word for 'millions', making it a feminine noun instead of a masculine noun.

A man who legally changed his name to Santa Claus was called to sit on a New York murder trial jury last week, and like a good citizen he showed up. The Copiague man who once went by Frank Pascuzzi didn’t have to decide if the defendant was naughty or nice, though, because the case was quickly dismissed. Pascuzzi spends every winter working as St. Nick, but wore a conservative shirt and jeans to the Suffolk County Courthouse and insists it wasn’t his status as Father Christmas that got him out of the civic headache. Did he take his sleigh? Santa Claus, nee Frank Pascuzzi, was called to serve on the jury of a Long Island murder case last week . ‘It wasn’t just because I was Santa Claus I got off — everyone else got off, too,’ Mr. Claus told the New York Post. That’s not always the case. Sometimes being Kris Kringle pays off. Last year, Claus was questioned by a police officer after accidentally rear-ending another vehicle with his truck. But instead of a ticket, the cop just wanted a photo op. Not today: Claus was ready to do his civic duty, but the Suffolk County, new York murder case was dismissed . 'Am I on the naughty or nice list?': Claus has the driver's license to prove his name and says courthouse employees wanted to know if they'd be getting gifts this year . ‘He looked at my license and says, “Are you kidding me?”’  Claus said. “I said, ‘Look, here’s my credit card.”’ They took pictures together along with the fake reindeer Claus keeps in his pickup for these sorts of occasions. The Long Islander legally changed his name to Santa Claus in February and has the license to prove it, which caused a small commotion at the courthouse. Always a hit: Claus is always a hit at Christmas time, but he's asked to pose for photos year round . Yuletide: The father of four even has a son who was born on Christmas. It earned him the middle name Yule . ‘When I got there, the police were like, “Am I on the naughty or nice list?”’ the 54-year-old told The Post. ‘My reply was, “If you have to ask, you already know.”’ Claus and his wife Betty have four children and one of them was even born on Christmas day, which earned him the middle name Yule. He is an unabashed Christmas lover. ‘It’s tons of fun!’ he told the Post. ‘Everyone wants to talk to me. Everybody wants to be my friend.’ 'Everybody wants to be my friend!': Claus has not regrets about the name change.

A car carrying a group of four young people burst into flames after it left the road in a horrific crash that claimed all their lives. Bruno Vaccarezza, 19, is believed to have been driving at high speed when he lost control of the vehicle which flipped over a guardrail before it was enveloped in a fireball. Pictures from the scene in Greenburgh, New York, show the terrible aftermath of the collision with the front wheels pushed back to where the front doors of the car should be. His passengers were named as Fernanda Gomez, 19, Juliana Restreop, 18, and Vincent Mendoza, 20. The three teenagers and 20-year-old were killed when the rented car they were travelling in slammed head on into a bridge abutment and burst into flames . Police are investigating what caused the accident which occurred on the Sprain Brook Parkway early yesterday morning. State Police investigator, Joseph Becerra, said: 'We're not ruling anything out at this time. 'Part of the . investigation is to determine if the operator lost control or was going . too fast.' Police identified Bruno Vaccarezza, from Greenwich, Connecticut, as the driver of the rented Volkswagen which the other three passengers who where from Port Chester, New York, and Norwalk,Connecticut. New York State Police Major, Michael Kopy told ABC news yesterday: 'Clearly . speed is going to be a factor. There was significant damage. The . vehicle went off the road, and struck the abutment head on'. Police at the scene said speed had played a factor in the accident which caused severe damage to the car and killed its four passengers . Major Kopy added there was no immediate evidence to suggest drugs or alcohol as a factor in the crash, but more analysis was needed. Bruno Vaccarezza, 19, was driving the rented Volkswagen when it crashed and burst into flames killing three other people . Police also reported finding no signs of skid marks on the nearby pavement. The accident took place on the Sprain Brook Parkway in Greenburgh, just 20 miles north of New York City. Though no one witnessed the accident, a woman who later passed the scene called police to report the massive blaze at around 5.20am yesterday. Firefighters put out the flames roughly 20 minutes later, but all four of the car's young occupants were dead. Police have suggested the car may have been rented because he had been involved in a previous accident in his own vehicle. The 19-year-old motor enthusiast posted several photographs and videos of cars on Facebook, including a YouTube video clip entitled 'Craziest Car Wreck EVER', which shows a vehicle slamming into an overpass on a busy road. Another post from March of this year called 'Crazy Cop chase' shows a police car pursuing a quad bike at high speed.

Authorities in Colorado believe a bad batch of synthetic marijuana combined with a Phish concert is responsible for the hospitalization of more than 60 people over the past week. Denver and Colorado Springs-area hospitals first started noticing more patients being admitted to the emergency room suffering from a bad reaction to the drug 'Black Mamba' last Tuesday. But that number grew to more than 60 over the Labor Day weekend, corresponding with a three-day Phish concert at Dick's Sporting Goods Stadium in Denver. Outbreak: Hospitals in Denver and Colorado Springs have reported more than 60 people being admitted for bad reactions to the synthetic marijuana 'Black Mamba' over the past week . Factor: Health officials believe the three day Phish concert at Denver's Dick's Sporting Goods Arena may have contributed in the outbreak . Spread at the concert? The band's performances are known to incite marijuana usage . 'Black Mamba', also known as 'K2' or 'Spice', is a synthetic form of marijuana produced when a chemical substance which mimics the effects of THC is sprayed on herbs. The drug used to be legal, but has since been outlawed in may states, including Colorado, for the sometimes fatal side effects and the fact that it can be 800 times more potent than THC. The synthetic drug can be purchased on the black market, or sometimes found in liquor stores marketed as incense. Charge nurse Amanda Puhal of the University of Colorado Hospital has worked in emergency rooms for 11 years, and says she has never witnessed an outbreak this bad. Denver Health Medical Center has reported patients being admitted screaming and violent - completely out of control. Bad batch: Patients have been admitted to University of Colorado Hospital, above, and others with reactions such as hallucinating or worse - not breathing . Others have been admitted unresponsive or having seizures. Doctors have put several patients on life support and some are in comas. 'There have been reported fatalities in other states,' emergency room doctor Jeffrey Sankoff told 7News. 'In our cases, abusers have been out in traffic, they've jumped off buildings. Agitation to the point where they're totally out of mind.' Medical toxicologist Dr Kennon Heard said he wouldn't be surprised if someone dies in this outbreak. 'The truth is that these people are sick enough that if they didn't get health care, there's a good chance that some of them wouldn't have made it,' Heard said. While Denver doctors say it's clear that there's a bad batch of the synthetic drug being distributed, the Phish concert this past weekend may also be to blame for the spike in emergency room visits, as the band's performances are known to incite marijuana usage.","More than 60 people have been admitted to Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado-area hospitals over the past week .

A determined Boston Marathon bombing survivor, who made the brave decision to have her left foot amputated, has taken the first tentative steps in her beloved high heels with a new prosthetic leg. Heather Abbott, 39, decided to have her foot amputated after two surgeries and advice from doctors that keeping it may lead to a life blighted by chronic pain. Ms Abbott walked in a pair of four-inch nude stilettos last week, five months on from the devastating attack on April 15. Scroll down for video . Standing strong: Heather Abbott, who survived the Boston Marathon bombing in April, but had her left foot amputated is now back in high heels thanks to a prosthetic limb . Striding forward: Ms Abbott, from Rhode Island, has made a determined recovery in the five months since the terrorist attack . Ms Abbott told WCVB: 'I'd like to get back to wearing the things I used to wear.' She joked that she might need to leave the town where she lives because there are so many cobbled streets which are typically difficult to negotiate in towering heels. The bombing survivor currently has a prosthetic leg which she says is a little on the bulky side. She has also used a waterproof prosthetic to allow her to do one of her favorite activities of paddle-boarding. However thanks to Next Step Prosthetics in Manchester, New Hampshire, Ms Abbott is being fitted for a new limb with a silicon cover which will look much more like her other leg. The artificial limb costs in the region of $20,000 and will take around a month to complete. In one of many harrowing decisions made in the wake of the attack, Ms Abbott made the choice to have her foot amputated. She said that her doctor 'gave me the rundown, as did several other doctors, on the choice I had, and basically it was whether to keep my leg, the rest, my foot actually is where the injury occurred, or to amputate sort of below the knee'. She added: 'And it certainly was a . difficult decision, but when I weighed the pros and cons, I think this . was the best option for me. First steps: Ms Abbott is having a new silicon-covered prosthetic leg created by Next Step Prosthetics in Manchester, New Hampshire . Well-heeled: The 39-year-old's plaster-covered artificial limb. She says once it is finished, she hopes it will help her get back to 'wearing things she used to wear' Boston strong: Heather Abbott is one of several victims who has bravely spoken out following the bombing. She was given the honor of throwing the first pitch at Fenway (right) 'It would likely be shorter, one of my legs would likely be shorter than the other, and I wouldn't be able to live the lifestyle that I did prior to the injury.' On the day of the bombings, Ms Abbott and half a dozen friends took in the traditional Patriots' Day Red Sox game at Fenway Park. They left early and headed to Forum, a bar close to the blast site. Ms Abbott was at the back of the long line, waiting as bouncers checked IDs, when the first blast went off. Unlike many, she knew exactly what it was.

Mr Coady, who must now use a wheelchair, is suing Burton and the ski resort for negligence claiming that they failed to warn him of the dangers of using the snowboard and failing to verify his age. Suing for fall: A teenage snowboarder is suing boardmaker Burton and the Wentworth Ski Resort (pictured) after he was left paralysed when he crashed in the terrain park . Burton was offering free energy drinks and a trial of their new snowboards in February 2008 when Mr Coady signed a waiver and skied into the terrain park to try out the board and crashed. He claimed that the resort did not supervise boarders testing the Burton boards or warn them of dangers of using the terrain park which included rails, jumps and hills. The defendants argued there was not sufficient evidence to go to trial but the judge dismissed it, preserving Mr Coady’s right to a trial. Burton had appealed earlier this year but the resort did not and a trial date has yet to be set. Suing for negligence: Burton were offering a free trial of their new snowboards when Mr Coady signed a waiver and crashed (file photo) In January this year Caleb Moore, an . innovative freestyle snowmobile rider who was hurt in a horrific crash . at the Winter X Games in Colorado, died aged 25. Mr Moore was attempting a back-flip last Thursday in the freestyle event when the skis on his 450lb snowmobile caught the lip of the landing area, sending him flying over the handlebars. Mr Moore landed face first into the snow with his snowmobile rolling over him. He stayed down for quite some time, before walking off with help and going to a hospital to treat his concussion. Mr Moore developed bleeding around his heart and was flown to a hospital in Grand Junction for surgery. The family later said that Moore, of Krum, Texas, also had a complication involving his brain. Last year sports teacher Mike Siddall, from Bollington in Cheshire defied doctors' dire predictions by learning to walk, run and board again after he faced life in a wheelchair after a snowboarding accident.

After months of speculation and hand-wringing from fans, the search for the Fifty Shades Of Grey leads is over. Dakota Johnson and Charlie Hunnam will take on the roles of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, respectively, in the anticipated big-screen adaptation of the sexy novel. The news was tweeted by novel author E.L. James on Monday morning: 'Good moaning all. Hold on to your hats...' she wrote shortly before making the announcements. Scroll down for video . Finally: Dakota Johnson, seen here at the 12th annual Chrysalis Butterfly Ball in New York City on June 8, was announced as Anastasia Steele on Monday . Dakota, 23, previously appeared in The Social Network - in which she shared a love scene with Justin Timberlake - and had small roles in 21 Jump Street, The Five-Year Engagement and Beastly. She is the daughter of Don Johnson, best known for TV shows Miami Vice and Nash Bridges, and his actress ex-wife Melanie Griffith. It's thought producers cast Dakota because they wanted a young, up-and-coming actress to play the role of virginal Anastasia, who embarks on an intense voyage of sexual discovery with her S&M-loving boss Christian. Family tree: Dakota stands with mum Melanie Griffith at the 63rd annual Golden Globe Awards, held in Beverly Hills, California in January 2006 . Charlie, who is 33 years old and British, stars in the dark biker thriller Sons Of Anarchy as Jackson 'Jax' Teller and also appeared in Guillermo del Toro's robot epic Pacific Rim. He gained fame on the UK drama Queer As Folk, on which he played gay teenager Nathan Maloney; the show ran from 1999-2000 and was remade for American audiences by Showtime (under the same title). The castings close waves of rumours about . who would take on the roles - Emma Watson, Imogen Poots, Armie Hammer . and Ian Somerhalder, among many others, were at one time tied to a main . role on the film. Producer Michael De Luca tweeted on Monday that Dakota and Charlie showed great promise when they auditioned for the roles together: 'Auditions were stunning, incredible chemistry!' he wrote. The duo had to do a 'chemistry read,' meaning a scene on video, and Charlie also had several tests with various actresses; he seemingly wanted to know who his co-star was before committing to the project, according to The Wrap. Show it off: Charlie Hunnam has starred on FX's Sons Of Anarchy since 2008 . Flying off the shelves: Fifty Shades Of Grey became the fastest-selling paperback of all time after its 2011 release . Author Bret Easton Ellis, meanwhile, claims that Robert Pattinson was E.L. James' first choice for the lead role. He tweeted Monday about an exchange he had with the writer at a party earlier in the summer. 'E.L. James and I were at Rob Pattinson's house when she admitted that Rob was first choice for Christian,' Ellis said on Twitter. 'When E.L. James asked me who I thought should be Christian I said 'James Deen, of course,' and then she shoved me,' he added. 'We were both very wasted.' Fifty Shades Of Grey will be directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy), based off the adapted script by Kelly Marcel (Terra Nova). The novel is the fastest-selling paperback of all time and has sold more than 70 million copies worldwide. Controversial for its depictions of sadomasochistic sex and more, Fifty Shades Of Grey marked the rise of 'mummy porn,' or racy reading intended for mainstream, often middle-aged women. The film is currently slated for release in August 2014. So postmodern: Fifty Shades author E.L. James took to Twitter for the big reveal .",Author Bret Easton Ellis claims Robert Pattinson was E.L.

X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger has labelled Simon Cowell’s impending fatherhood ‘crazy’ and said of the mother-to-be: ‘But isn’t she married?’ The 35-year-old pop beauty expressed her surprise at news Cowell was expecting a child with socialite Lauren Silverman as the show returned to ITV last night. She took her place on the judging panel alongside Take That star Gary Barlow, Louis Walsh and Sharon Osbourne, who reclaimed her seat after a five-year absence. But Walsh, 61, who says he will leave at the end of this series – his tenth – was more positive about 53-year-old Cowell’s news after spending an evening with him . He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I’ve met Lauren and she is a lovely girl, she is gorgeous. I think it is going to change him in a really good way, it’s going to level him. I went out with him last night and he went home early. He wasn’t drinking, he went back with Lauren. ‘It’s a great reality check for him because he’s a workaholic and Lauren is chilled-out. She is going to be a great influence on him.’ Asked about 36-year-old Lauren’s marriage status, Walsh corrected Nicole adding: ‘No, not any more. She’s great fun and I think she makes him feel younger, that’s what has kept him interested.’ The hit singing competition returned with star performers including 35-year-old female prison officer Sam Bailey, who stunned the audience with her powerful vocals. Louis also revealed that the show’s judging panel were enjoying the show more after former judge Tulisa Contostavlos was replaced by Sharon. He added: ‘The atmosphere is much better. Sharon has brought something extra to the show, I can’t explain what it is but she is fun and she is feisty. Scherzinger took her place on the judging panel alongside Gary Barlow, Louis Walsh and Sharon Osbourne . ‘We all get on incredibly well. She is the catalyst for fun on the show. The atmosphere was quite serious last year. Sharon has brought an amazing difference to the show and we all love her. ‘It’s better when it’s more light hearted, it’s a family show and it’s not all about the singing.’ And he warned Tulisa, who is on police bail after being caught up in an alleged drugs scandal, that she had ‘lost her way’ and been overdoing the partying in recent months – but believed she would rebuild her reputation.

Bruised: David Cameron, pictured leaving Downing Street today, insisted his whips did a 'good job' despite failing to persuade dozens of his own MPs to turn up for the vote .

Other missing senior figures included . minister without portfolio Kenneth Clarke, international development . minister Alan Duncan, Treasury minister David Gauke and Lib Dem pensions . minister Steve Webb. MPs and ministers voiced astonishment at the . light-touch handling of the crucial vote by Old Etonian Sir George – . with one minister describing his approach as ‘pretty complacent’. William Hague was also facing criticism for allowing Nick Clegg to make the closing speech in Thursday night’s debate. One Tory MP said: ‘Clegg was hopeless . and ended up getting people’s backs up rather than winning them over. If William had done the winding up speech I think some people would have . been won round.’ In the aftermath of the vote, one MP . said: ‘It was just shambolic. People are saying they’ve hardly been . spoken to, there are a lot of people who are not here. What have the . whips been doing?’ Tory MP Peter Bone, a habitual rebel, . raised eyebrows in the Commons by revealing he had been given no . instructions about how to vote on Syria. 'I have been under no pressure from . my Whip to vote one way or the other,’ he said, although he eventually . voted with the Government. One MP said the first he knew that Parliament . was being recalled was when easyJet sent him a text message offering . him a flight home. ‘Perhaps the Whips’ Office should just be franchised . out to easyJet,’ he said. Pressure: Sir George Young faces being sacked as the Chief Whip after the Prime Minister suffered humiliation in the Commons vote . Shock: The House of Commons was stunned when the result was announced, inflicting an embarrassing defeat on the Prime Minister . Another MP said that although an aide . to the PM had called him, presumably about Syria, he had left no . message and never called back. Also among those who missed the vote . were Lib Dem whips Jenny Willott and Mark Hunter as well as Lib Dem . parliamentary private secretaries Lorely Burt and Tessa Munt. They were . among 31 Tory and 14 Lib Dem MPs who missed the vote, despite a . three-line whip being imposed. Normally in tight votes MPs are . ordered back regardless of the difficulty. In past votes, even gravely . ill MPs have been wheeled into the Commons on trolleys. Tories: International development minister Alan Duncan, Treasury minister David Gauke and Ken Clarke, minister without portfolio, all missed the vote . Lib Dems: Whips Mark Hunter and Jenny Willott, and pensions minister Steve Webb were also absent . In contrast, Mr Gauke, Mr Duncan and . Mr Webb are all understood to have been given permission to  continue . their holidays. Mr Clark was also excused duty, as were the four other . Lib Dems.

Justine Greening was chatting to foreign office minister Mark Simmonds . (right) in a small room near the Commons as MPs voted on military action . International Development Secretary  Justine Greening issued a grovelling  apology to David Cameron yesterday after missing the crunch vote because she was lost in conversation in an ‘almost soundproof’ room with another minister. Miss Greening and Foreign Office  minister Mark Simmonds, were just yards away from the chamber on Thursday night, and had already voted to help defeat a Labour amendment.The pair had apparently ducked into a room for an urgent discussion about Rwanda. Despite the importance of the debate, the pair somehow contrived to miss the crunch vote in which Labour teamed up with Tory and Liberal Democrat rebels to inflict a humiliating defeat on the Prime Minister. The pair remonstrated with Speaker John Bercow, arguing that the Division Bell, which alerts MPs to a vote, had not been rung. But Mr Bercow dismissed their complaint – pointing out there was no requirement for the bell to be rung. And furious Commons officials yesterday insisted that the deafening bell had been rung in the corridor outside the room where the pair of ministers were chatting inside. Extensive tests of the system yesterday confirmed it was working properly. Hundreds of monitors  displaying Commons business were also tested. A source close to Miss Greening said she had apologised to Mr Cameron for her ‘deeply unfortunate’ absence, which was ‘clearly embarrassing’. Asked about their absence, Mr Cameron said: ‘This was a technical issue. ‘They had made it for the first vote, they were in a room in the House of Commons where they didn’t hear the division bell. They missed the vote. ‘They have apologised profoundly, I have accepted that apology. It wouldn’t have changed the result.’ After voting at 10pm, Miss Greening, 44, and Mr Simmonds, 49, had apparently ducked into the little known ‘Reasons Room’ just behind the Commons chamber for a confidential discussion. The next, critical, vote was scheduled for 10.15pm. But the pair said the TV monitor displaying Commons business was turned off and they did not hear the division bell outside, or the doorkeepers outside loudly shouting ‘division’ to signal a vote. Government whips apparently failed to check the room or knock on the door while rounding up MPs to vote. The Reasons Room was the scene of the famous episode in 1963 when the then Minister for War John Profumo was grilled by fellow MPs over his relationship with Christine Keeler. A House of Commons spokesman said it was a ‘solidly constructed room with a well-fitting door’. The spokesman also dismissed suggestions the pair could have missed the vote because of a failure of Parliamentary systems designed to alert MPs to votes. ‘Both divisions [votes] proceeded as normal last night, with division bells and the usual audio/visual indications on the hundreds of monitors around the estate. ‘The division bells have been tested this morning and are working correctly. The Commons spokesman added: ‘There would have been a lot of activity there around those [meeting] rooms. ‘I think it would have been clear that there had been a division on and those involved would have known there was a division on as well.’","Prime Minister humiliated in the Commons after losing by just 13 votes .

Koni Dole, of Huntley, MT., returned Friday night to the field less than a year after having his right leg amputated below his knee. Not only is he playing again, but he made a significant contribution in his first game back since the horrific injury that changed his life. Mr Dole broke his right leg while playing football, doctors told him he’d never play again. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Determined to play: Koni Dole took less than one year to return to the football field following an amputation . A senior at Huntley Project High School, Mr Dole horrifically broke his leg during the team’s last game of the 2012 season. ‘I was just kind of like, 'Why does this have to happen to me?’ Dole told ABC News. ‘I know what it feels like to have a last game. Or what I thought was my last play.’ Multiple emergency surgeries later, the leg was severely infected – doctors gave him the option of contracting major illness from keeping it, or amputate. Mr Dole went ahead with the amputation. ‘As soon as I learned I might have to amputate, I started looking up amputees that play sports, and made the promise that I'd be back on the field,’ Mr Dole told ABC News. Amazing: Fitted with a carbon fiber blade, Mr Dole is able to play football again . Mr Dole was fitted with a carbon fiber blade below his right knee and he soon set about the long, arduous process rehabbing the leg and learning to walk again while working towards a goal he was told wouldn’t be possible. ‘The doctors told me I'd never play football again and I just always had that in the back of my mind, driving me,’ Mr Dole told ABC News. The teenager was back wrestling for the school within three months and ran track in the spring, according to ABC News. After working out all summer to be back in shape, Friday night finally came, Mr Dole was back on the field . Full tilt: Mr Dole did not appear to hold back, scoring two touchdowns and recording a sack in his first game . All systems go: Mr Dole trained hard to put himself in a position to return to the football field . ‘It’s an indescribable feeling… to be back on the field with my teammates and just thinking that my last play was on this field and just to be here, back here again is just an indescribable feeling,’ Mr Dole told GazPrepSports. The courageous teen’s return wasn’t just for show, he was a force in scoring two touchdowns and recording a sack in his team’s 45-0 victory over Joliet. ‘When a young man works so hard and not even know if he’ll play the game, and to put in the time and effort, I think he deserves it,’ coach Guy Cole told GazPrepSports. Footage of the game showed Mr Dole playing full tilt. Running, blocking and tackling with ease, even breaking tackles on some plays. For more videos, please go to GazPrepSports . Just one of the guys: Mr Dole celebrates during the game, which his school won 45-0 . Mr Dole’s parents also heaped praise on their amazing son. ‘I’m very proud of him, and I hope his story will motivate a lot of young athletes around Montana, especially around America,’ Fualelei ‘Andy’ Dole told GazPrepSports. Reflecting on the past year, Mr. Dole’s mother told GazPrepSports she never doubted he would return to the football field. ‘Just to overcome all this and to be back on the field with my teammates, it's probably the best feeling I've ever had,’ Mr Dole told ABC News. As if being on the field wasn’t news enough, Montana State – Mr Dole’s dream school – offered him a preferred walk-on scholarship to continue playing football, according to ABC News.","Koni Dole's right leg was amputated below the knee after a horrific injury during the final game last season .

It had previously been thought a coincidence that the pair met at St Andrews. Kate had a place at Edinburgh University in 2000 but gave it up and took a gap year in Italy, reapplying to St Andrews for 2001 after William’s place became public. Kate: The Future Queen, by Mail on Sunday Royal Editor Katie Nicholl, also claims Carole Middleton held a secret summit with William to ask whether he planned to propose to her daughter. Reunited: William and Kate pictured in 2007 . The book also tells how William and Kate took a make-or-break holiday to the Seychelles following their split in 2007 and made a pact to marry and have children. Kate achieved two As and a B in her A Levels – the grades she needed for Edinburgh – and the university was her first choice. William achieved an A in geography, a B in history of art and a C in biology and won a place to study history of art after a year out. Close: Kate Middleton and Prince William on the day of their graduation ceremony at St Andrew's University . Applications to St Andrews rose by 44 per cent after the news emerged, meaning Kate’s decision was risky as there was no guarantee she would get a place. Jasper Selwyn, a careers adviser at Kate’s former school, Marlborough College, and house tutor Joan Gall both confirmed her first choice was Edinburgh. Mr Selwyn said: ‘Kate’s firm choice was Edinburgh and that was confirmed.’ According to her house mistress, Ann Patching, the change of heart came as a surprise. She said: . ‘After she left school, Catherine made some different decisions, but why she made those decisions I don’t know.’ In 2007 William and Kate split amid rumours she disapproved of his party lifestyle and his reluctance to propose. A make-or-break holiday followed and Kate reportedly gave William an ultimatum. According to the book, the pair then made a pact to marry and have children. However at Christmas 2009 Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, reportedly took William aside to discuss a possible engagement. A friend said: ‘She put some pressure on William to let the family know where it was all leading. William reassured her the relationship was very much on track and that there would be an engagement soon. Carole trusted William and put her faith in him.’ The book also claims that Kate and William met for the first time through mutual friends from Marlborough in the summer of 1999 at Highgrove.","Book claims Kate changed higher education plans to match William's .

A woman brought in for questioning for sexually stalking and propositioning her preacher suddenly, without prompting, admitted to a ruthless 2004 murder. Clara Rector is now charged in the killing of Tommy Hope of Camdenton, Missouri. Police were first called about Rector last month when Jerry Sousley alerted them that his parishioner had been sending hem messages ‘regarding inappropriate matters of a sexual nature.’ Surprise: Clara Jean Rector, while being questioned for stalking the pastor of her Baptist church, suddenly told police she killed a man with a butcher knife in 2004 . Basically, the pastor at Camdenton Bible Baptist Church said Rector, 36, was stalking him, reports the Kansas City Star. Sousley said he found a notebook in which Rector had documented her fantasies with imaginary depictions of their shared sexual activities. Sousley, who is married, says Rector also made advances, but when he turned her down she only came on stronger. He even says he began finding the notes on his car windshield. In court documents, Sousley alleges Rector, who is also married, turned on him when he wouldn’t have sex and that she threatened to ‘destroy’ him. Infatuation: Pastor Jerry Sousley of the Camdenton Bible Baptist Church in Missouri first alerted police to Rector, but for stalking and threatening him . Married: Clara, left, is married to Jason Rector, right. Jason was also implicated for allegedly helping his wife hide evidence of her stalking when he disposed of a notebook Clara used to document her sexual fantasies of Sousley . Fearing for his safety and that of his family, Sousley turned to police and Rector was arrested. But while questioning her in the matter, Rector shocked cops by admitting to the murder of Tommy Hope. Hope was found dead in his home in April 2004. Rector was questioned in the case but neither she nor anyone else was ever charged and the file had become a cold case. Rector told police she’d had an affair with Hope and that she’d gone to his house that day to buy drugs. When he told her he didn’t have any, she . said she freaked out and with a butcher knife in hand ‘jumped on his . back and cut his throat.’ Shock: No one, including Camden County Sheriff Dwight Franklin saw the admission coming, though Rector had been questioned in the crime . ‘I was high,’ she told them, ‘and not thinking.’ Before her spontaneous admission, Rector documented her previous highs and lows on a blog called PrayReadLive.

Shameful: Amrik Gill, 26, called his time in jail 'the best holiday ever' and wished he could stay longer . A serial fraudster sent to jail for 18 months has boasted that his sentence was ‘the best holiday ever’. And Amrik Gill, 26, even had the cheek to thank taxpayers for funding his jail term. In one of a number of posts on Twitter after his release, he wrote: ‘Just had the best holiday ever. Would like to thank the tax payer for making it possible.’ Referring to the number of letters permitted in each tweet he added: ‘140 characters is like 18 months ... Not long enough.’ Gill has been jailed six times for scamming football supporters and music fans out of thousands of pounds after falsely advertising tickets for events over the internet. He was jailed at Manchester Crown Court in January for taking cash for football and concert tickets he did not possess, but was released halfway through his 18-month sentence. Last night a spokesman for Families Against Crime said: ‘This conman has defrauded dozens of innocent people out of thousands of pounds yet he has still not learnt his lesson. ‘It is disgraceful that after his release from prison on licence he should immediately take to Twitter and deride the criminal justice system. Surely this is a breach of his licence and illustrates he is not ready to be released and should be returned to prison to complete his sentence . The average cost of each prisoner is £34,700 a year, according to the latest figures from the Ministry of Justice. Manchester councillor Norman Lewis said: ‘He’s just sticking his fingers up to the law and to society . ‘Individuals like this are just callous people who don’t give a damn about how they get their money. ‘Let’s hope if he carries on offending now he’s out of prison, he gets a longer sentence fit for purpose.’ Tony Lloyd, police and crime commissioner for Greater Manchester, added: ‘Gill had 140 characters – it’s a real shame he didn’t use them to apologise to his victims.’ Bragging: Gill used Twitter to crow about how much he enjoyed prison and urged his local paper to print his comments .

But only a month later Gill, . of Chorlton, was caught scamming a music fan on the website Gumtree. He was sentenced to 18 months behind bars.

"By . Kathryn Blundell . PUBLISHED: . 16:40 EST, 28 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:12 EST, 29 August 2013 . When the Cambridges proudly released their first family photos - with the snugly wrapped Prince George cradled in his mother's arms - the nation breathed a collective 'awww'. Swaddled in a simple shawl, the youngest member of the Royal Family was, we all agreed, what a newborn baby should look like. After all, the image of the Virgin Mary and swaddled baby Jesus is one we've grown up to recognise as the embodiment of motherhood. Well, not any more. Last week, grandmother Valerie Butcher inadvertently dragged the new prince and his devoted mother into a debate on the wrongs and rights of swaddling by writing an angry letter to a newspaper about an incident involving her four-week-old grandson, also called George. Good enough for royalty: Prince George of Cambridge was seen wrapped in a swaddling shawl in his first official pictures . Valerie wrote that her daughter had taken George to her local clinic where she was 'sternly told off' for swaddling her child. What's more, she now has a note on her file saying that by swaddling, she 'is willing to put her baby's life at risk'. In short, she has been marked down as a bad parent. Swaddling involves wrapping a newborn in a thin cotton sheet or blanket, so its arms are pinned against its body by the fabric, which is then secured under the child's body. Many mums hail it as an easy way to settle very young babies as it makes them feel warm and safe. As a bonus, by restricting the movement of the arms, swaddling suppresses the 'startle reflex', where babies suddenly - and often - throw out their arms in their sleep, waking themselves in the process. Encouraging the trend: Baby Cambridge was also seen in the swaddling blanket when he left hospital with his parents and other new mothers and fathers have been following suit . Not too tight: Prince George had the blanket loosely wrapped around him on his first day out . Swaddling isn't advised for babies once they're capable of rolling over, as the cloth can end up over their  face, increasing the risk of suffocation and cot death - but many mothers still swear by it up to the age of around four months. Does any of this sound like poor parenting? It certainly doesn't to me. I swaddled my children - both my daughter, who is now 17 years old, and my son, who is six - and I swear I got more sleep as a result. However, there's an increasing body of opinion calling for an end to it, pointing to the danger of the baby overheating, and suggesting the practice could even damage their joints. A 2009 study carried out by the universities of Bristol and Warwick indicated an increased risk of cot death in babies who were swaddled. 'If your baby doesn't like it, then don't force it. Swaddling has to be baby-led' Of the group of infants in the study who succumbed to cot death between 2003 and 2006, 24 per cent were swaddled, compared with 6 per cent in a control group of healthy babies. However, other factors, such as sleeping in the parents' bed or on a sofa, or being in poor health, may also explain the results. The fear is that swaddling can send a baby's temperature spiralling out of control. Janet Fyle, of the Royal College Of Midwives, says: 'A newborn is unable to regulate its own body temperature in the way an adult can. That's why the current advice for mothers is not to wrap their babies tightly or in heavy blankets, especially in warm weather. And a blanket should never be added to a swaddled baby.' Professor Nicholas Clarke, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Southampton General Hospital, is firmly in the anti-swaddle camp. He says: 'We saw a huge resurgence in swaddling in 2011, generated by the suggestion it could ease colic (a condition where very young babies cry uncontrollably for no apparent reason), though I’ve seen no evidence to support this. 'That spike in popularity linked directly to an increase in the number of babies I saw with hip dysplasia - where the bones of the hip joint are not aligned correctly. Parenting debate: Swaddled newborns tend to sleep better but some believe it isn't worth the risk . 'Infants are born with very flexible joints, which are also under the effects of relaxin - a hormone women produce when they’re pregnant to loosen joints and make birth easier. 'So a newborn's joints are more prone to issues at this age than any other. They need to be able to bend their legs up and out at the hips.' His concerns are clear: swaddling infants so their hips and knees are kept straight or together may increase the risk of hip dysplasia and dislocation. Yet many see Professor Clarke’s stance as an  over-reaction. Midwife Janet Fyle says: 'I'm not sure it's such a big issue - why would anyone wrap their baby up to the extent that it's causing developmental problems? This only happens if you're rough with your baby, so it’s unlikely in my view.' Childcare consultant and author Rachel Waddilove, who has worked as a maternity nurse for celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow, is passionate about the benefits of swaddling. 'It's a wonderful way of ensuring babies feel safe and secure when put into their cots,' she says. 'I will often go to a home where every time the baby tries to drop off to sleep, his little arms go and he wakes himself up. I swaddle him, tuck him in tight and he will normally drop off happily and quickly.' She rejects the suggestion that swaddling hurts babies. 'The fuss that is being made about it being bad for babies' hips is, I believe, unsubstantiated. If we were binding babies then that would be a different matter, but that's not the same as swaddling, where babies' legs aren’t restricted.' She points out that the precautions she takes when swaddling are the ones any sensible mother would take. 'Obviously, you need to keep an eye on your baby’s temperature, by feeling at the base of his neck, to avoid the risk of overheating. But it’s a wonderful tool to help your baby settle and sleep well.' And sleep, as any parent will tell you, is a big issue. In the early days, many parents feel lucky if they get four hours in a row, and I spent the first few weeks with each of my children wondering if I'd ever know what it felt like to be rested and focused again. Under wraps . In Tudor times, swaddling involved wrapping the baby in linen bands from head to foot until nine months old . I was so demented with tiredness I often found myself in the middle of a task, like making up a bottle, and forgetting where I was and having to start all over again. Who wouldn't try every sleep trick in the book? Yet teaching parents about swaddling has been gradually dropped from many antenatal courses. Teresa Walsh, a midwife childbirth educator at London’s Portland Hospital, says: 'Although I don't mention swaddling as part of my baby-care classes because it's not a core skill, parents always bring it up - it's very fashionable at the moment. 'I swaddled my babies but I'm not sure I would now because the research on its main benefit - more sleep - isn't good enough to say it makes any difference. Studies show that at best a child might sleep for an extra half-hour. 'And I actually think allowing babies to wake slightly makes them learn to settle themselves back to sleep - a key skill if a baby's ever going to go through the night.' Teresa encourages parents to try swaddling if they like - but to be mindful of their babies' reactions. 'If the baby settles and doesn't fight it, then I say go with it. But if your baby doesn't like it, then don’t force it. Swaddling has to be baby-led.' Janet Fyle agrees. 'Midwives don't live with mothers or know their babies better than a parent does - we can only tailor advice in context with each family’s routine and preferences.' Indeed, if swaddling is good enough for a future King, then surely it’s good enough for the rest of us?","Prince Cambridge has been pictured in a swaddling shawl .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:02 EST, 2 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:11 EST, 2 September 2013 . President Obama and his top aides began a full-scale political offensive on Sunday to persuade a skeptical Congress to approve a military strike against Syria, but faced a struggle to win over lawmakers from both parties and a war-weary American public. The President made calls to members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with more scheduled for Monday, underscoring the task confronting the administration before it can go ahead with using force in response to a deadly chemical attack blamed on the Syrian government. Dozens of lawmakers, some in tennis shirts or shirtsleeves, cut short their vacations and streamed into the corridors of the Capitol building for a Sunday afternoon intelligence briefing on Syria with Mr Obama's national security team. Crisis talks: President Obama and Vice-President Biden meet John Kerry and Susan Rise to discuss Syria on Sunday . When they emerged nearly three hours later, there was no immediate sign that the many skeptics in Congress had changed their minds. Many questioned the broad nature of the measure the President is seeking, suggesting it needed to be narrowed. 'I am very concerned about taking America into another war against a country that hasn't attacked us,' California Democrat Janice Hahn said. On the way out of the briefing, she said the participants appeared 'evenly divided' on whether to give Mr Obama approval. Most seemed convinced Syria had engaged in chemical warfare. 'The searing image of babies lined up dead, that's what I can't get out of my mind right now,' Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz said after the closed-door briefing. But the credibility of the administration's intelligence is turning out to be a less important issue than the nature and usefulness of the response. U.S. military officials are using the . delay to reassess which ships will be used for a strike, and which . sites in Syria to target. One . change was a decision to send the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and its . entire strike group towards the Red Sea to help support the Syria . strike, if needed. Earlier in the day, Secretary of State John Kerry invoked the crimes of Hitler and Saddam Hussein, and warned of a potential threat to Israel a day after Mr Obama delayed an imminent attack on Syrian targets until after a congressional vote. Debate: The President meets national security advisers to discuss possible military action . Contact: Barack Obama called members of the House of Representatives to rally support . Even as Mr Kerry took to the airwaves touting new evidence that deadly sarin gas was used in the August 21 chemical attack near Damascus, the scope of the challenge confronting the administration became apparent. Lawmakers questioned the effectiveness of limited strikes; the possible unintended consequence of dragging the U.S. into another open-ended Middle East conflict; the wisdom of acting without broader international backing to share the burden; and the war fatigue of the American public. Polls show the public is largely opposed to U.S. military action. While Mr Kerry predicted the President would win the endorsement he wants, a cacophony of congressional critics - from liberal Democratics to Republican conservatives - illustrated just how hard that will be. 'I'm not convinced that the administration's support will resolve the issues in Syria,' Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, said as he left the meeting, adding he was leaning towards a 'no' vote. 'In terms of whether not a lot of questions were really answered today? I'd say no,' he said. Mr Kerry, the administration's most impassioned voice for intervention in Syria's two-and-a-half-year civil war, was left to publicly defend Mr Obama's reversal, a decision that puts any strike on hold for at least nine days. 'This is squarely now in the hands of Congress,' Mr Kerry told CNN, saying he had confidence lawmakers 'will do what is right because they understand the stakes'. Split: Protesters for and against military action confront each other outside the White House . Call for action: Protesters demanding military action shout over those opposing it at joint rallies in Washington DC . In a round of television appearances, Mr Kerry declined to say whether the President would proceed with military action if Congress rejected his request, as Britain's parliament did last week. He echoed Mr Obama's comments in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday, insisting the President had the right to act on his own if he choses that course. Mr Obama is taking a gamble by putting the brakes on the military assault he considers essential to maintain U.S. credibility, after he had said the use of chemical weapons would constitute a 'red line' for the U.S.. The consensus on Capitol Hill is that Mr Obama has a good chance of winning approval in the Democratic-led Senate, but the vote appears too close to call in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where the President's opponents rarely miss an opportunity to block him. The White House is due to talk with House Democrats by telephone on Monday, and Mr Obama will meet the heads of several key House and Senate committees in person on Tuesday. Acknowledging that the administration has its work cut out, Mr Kerry insisted Congress could not 'have it both ways' by demanding a voice and then abdicating responsibility to uphold the international bans on chemical weapons use. Mr Kerry used the television appearances to provide further evidence backing accusations against the Syrian government. 'I can share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us through an appropriate chain of custody, from east Damascus, from first responders, it has tested positive for signatures of sarin,' Mr Kerry told State of the Union. Innocents: According to U.S. estimates, of the 1,429 killed in the attack, 426 were children . Responsibility: French agents say Assad's regime is behind the nerve gas attack in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus on August 21 . It was the first time the administration had pinpointed the chemical used in the attack, which U.S. intelligence agencies said killed more than 1,400 people, many of them children. Mr Obama's efforts are sure to be hampered by his dismal relations with congressional Republicans. Another bitter face-off on government spending is looming this autumn. Lawmakers for the most part welcomed Mr Obama's decision to consult them, but looked in no hurry to reconvene early from their summer recess, which lasts until September 9. Underscoring a sense of wariness even from Mr Obama's traditional allies, many Democrats joined Republicans in saying the use-of-force resolution offered by the White House is too broad and that new language will be written for consideration. Several said they wanted it to include strict time limits, guarantee that no U.S. troops would be sent into Syria, and tie authorization for any further military action to additional chemical weapons use by Syria's President, Bashar Assad. 'The president said this is going to be limited. Yet that's an open-ended authorization to just about do anything he wants,' Democratic senator Tom Harkin said. 'The resolution as it is right now is so open-ended that it gives a blanket authority with no time limits. You can't accept it just on its face,' Republican Dennis Ross said. 'Now we have to look at what is the exit strategy if we do a strike, and I don't know if we're going to do that.' New York Republican Peter King said it . was unclear if lawmakers would sign off on an attack on Syria, but he . warned Mr Obama may have to overcome 'the isolationist wing' of the . Republican Party to prevail. Pressing issue: The President briefs senior advisers about the situation in Syria . Seeking to lay the groundwork for what is expected to be a heated congressional debate, Mr Kerry tipped his hand on one administration tactic - linking the vote to safeguarding U.S. ally Israel from the Syrian chemical weapons threat. 'I don't think they will want to vote, ultimately, to put Israel at risk,' Mr Kerry said. Lawmakers of both major political parties recognize how important it is to be seen as defenders of Israel, especially at election time.","Lawmakers cut short vacation to join intelligence briefing .

Banned: Footballer Craig Bellamy, pictured here competeing for the Team GB side at last summer's London Olympics, was banned from driving today after being caught speeding . Former Wales football captain Craig Bellamy was banned from driving and fined today after he was caught speeding on the motorway. Cardiff City forward Bellamy was disqualified for six months and ordered to pay a £900 fine plus £400 costs for travelling at 64mph in a 50mph limit section of the M62 going into Liverpool in April last year. The court heard Bellamy, who was not present at Liverpool Magistrates Court for the hearing, failed to respond to a police notice of intended prosecution. Simon Leong, prosecuting, said the former Manchester City and Newcastle United star was playing for Liverpool FC at the time of the offence. He was driving an Audi Q7 at the time. Bellamy, 33, was charged with failing to give a driver's identity as required under section 172 of the Road Traffic Act. He initially pleaded not guilty and a trial was set for November 27 last year but that had to be abandoned for medical reasons. The footballer, of Brides-Super-Ely, Cardiff, changed his plea to guilty on December 18, the day his rescheduled trial was due to take place, and the matter was adjourned until today's sentencing. Mr Leong said Bellamy had totted up nine penalty points for three previous speeding offences. 'This offence carries six points taking him over the threshold for disqualification,' he added. John Rowan, defending, told the court the star initially denied the offence because the notice was sent to an address where he was not living at the time. Too fast: Mr Bellamy was caught speeding in his Audi Q7, similar to the one pictured (file picture) He said: 'A plea of guilty was substituted in relation to that and he did accept that perhaps he could have done more to intercept the notice and ensure that the details were completed. Mr Rowan told the court he was not provided with information about the defendant's income but added: 'I should point out that Mr Bellamy is a former Premiership footballer. He is not currently playing in the Premier League but he is a professional footballer.' Deputy District Judge Simmons gave Bellamy credit of 10 per cent for his guilty plea, ordering a fine of £900 plus £400 costs and £15 victim surcharge which he must pay within 14 days.

He's not the obvious choice for someone to provide the third in line to the throne with spiritual guidance and a strong moral compass. But it is believed controversial nightclub owner Guy Pelly may have been chosen as the first of Prince George’s godparents. It was reported yesterday that Mr Pelly has been asked by his close friend Prince William to take on the role when his son is christened. Sources say Mr Pelly, 31, is ‘thrilled to bits’ and has been celebrating the news with pals. But while it is true to say that Mr Pelly is one of William’s inner circle, the inclusion of his name has come as a surprise to some. Mr Pelly, the son of wealthy Kent landowners, has a chequered public history. He was exposed by a tabloid newspaper in 2006 smoking cannabis at a party at which Prince William was present. It also emerged that he was with Prince Harry when he hired a Nazi uniform to wear to a private birthday party in 2005 – and went to the same party tastelessly dressed as the Queen. Since then he has carved out a career as a nightclub owner and promoter, although one of his bars, Public, in Chelsea, was closed down last year after repeated complaints about the drunken behaviour of its clientele. Mr Pelly himself has been accused of drink driving, and received an eight-week driving ban for doing 129mph on a dual carriageway last year. In line with royal tradition, Prince George is likely to have six godparents and friends say they can think of other ‘more likely’ candidates such as William’s best friend Thomas Van Straubenzee, his former private secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton and ex-nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke.

A mother-of-two who is at risk of cancer has chosen to have both her breasts removed and then reconstructed with a pioneering technique - using pig skin. Kelly Cruse, 32, has seen her mother, great grandmother and cousin all suffer breast cancer - and has an 87 percent chance of developing it herself because she carries the deadly BRCA gene. She decided to have a double mastectomy for the sake of her two young children Oliver, five, and Jamie, eight. Kelly Cruse is preparing to have both her breasts removed and reconstructed using pig skin. She, has seen her mother, great grandmother and cousin all suffer breast cancer and has a high chance of developing it herself . Breast reconstruction usually involves using tissue from another part of the patient's body - a practice that is painful and leaves multiple scars. But thanks to a pioneering operation she now has the option of having her bust reconstructed with a new technique called 'Strattice Tissue Matrix'. Normal implants are still used to rebuild the breast but a pig skin graft works like an internal bra - holding the implant in place and allowing natural droop of a breast. The procedure allows patients to have their reconstruction done in an all-in-one operation, rather than the two operations normally required. It also leaves the breasts more flexible and robust so patients can still enjoy sports and other physical activities. The graft is pigskin stripped of all pig cells so that the body doesn't reject it. It works like an internal bra - holding the implant in place and allowing natural droop of a breast . A cell needs to have a number of mistakes in its genetic code before it becomes cancerous. Doctors call these mistakes faults or mutations. They can occur due to substances people come into contact with. Or, they can happen because of mistakes that cells make when copying their genetic code before dividing into two new cells. Most of these abnormal cells die or are killed off by the immune system. It usually takes many years to gather enough genetic mistakes to cause cancer. But it is possible to be born with a gene fault that increases the risk of cancer. Scientists have identified a number of these so-called 'cancer genes'. The first genes to be found were BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 - women with these genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime. Women who tests positive can either have regular breast screenings or have surgery to remove their breasts (and possibly ovaries). Ms Ruse, of Plymouth, Devon, had genetic testing for the hereditary breast cancer gene BRCA2 in January after her mum urged her and her sister to be tested. After her results came back positive, Ms Ruse, a  cat breeder, took the decision to have a double mastectomy. She said: 'Cancer is in my family. My mum has had it and so has my great grandma and my cousin. 'Because I carry the gene I've got an 87 per cent chance of getting breast cancer and by the time I'm 40 I'll probably have to have my ovaries removed too because of the risk of ovarian cancer. 'When I found out I had the gene I knew I had to have a double mastectomy. Waiting for cancer to happen is not an option.' The graft is pigskin stripped of all pig cells so that the body doesn't reject it. It was first developed for use in general surgery such as hernia repairs and breast reconstruction in the US and was granted approval for use in Europe in 2008. Ms Ruse, who will go under the knife . this week, said: 'I didn't want the usual saline implants because I'll . be in and out of hospital a lot over the course of my life having to . have them altered and more surgery. Kelly Ruse had testing for the hereditary breast cancer gene BRCA2 in January after her mum urged her and her sister to be tested. She was told she had an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer (pictured) 'But I researched into it and found that I could have a reconstruction using Strattice. It's pig skin which is used to form a balcony and hold the implants in place as well as increase blood flow. 'I'm going to have both of my nipples removed too because the risk of breast cancer is still there if they leave them. So I'll have to have my nipples tattooed on after surgery. 'It's all a bit of a frightening prospect. I'll look normal to everyone else but I'll feel like my femininity has gone. 'I suppose I'm going to feel a bit like a mannequin but if it gives me the confidence to face people then I've got to do it.' Ms Ruse is now urging women to push for genetic testing if cancer is in their family. Breast reconstruction after a mastectomy can be carried out either with implants or by taking skin and fat from anywhere there is surplus -  typically the abdomen, buttocks or back - to tailor a new breast. The latter produces a soft breast that will age with the patient, but a drawback of these complex techniques is that patients are left with a significant scar from where the spare tissue was taken, meaning a longer recovery time too. Having an artificial implant after a mastectomy is the simplest solution, with shorter recovery times. However, a major shortcoming is that all too often patients are disappointed with the cosmetic result — many are left with a pert, high breast without much droop and which does not match the unaffected side. This is because all breast implants need a covering of tissue and skin over them to help anchor them in position and to provide a more natural look — and unfortunately most of this is removed if mastectomy is necessary. The new pig skin technique still uses normal implants to rebuild the breast, but the animal skin graft works like an internal bra - cradling the implant and allowing some of the natural droop of a normal breast. The graft, known as the Strattice graft, is pigskin stripped of all pig cells, so that the body doesn’t reject it. With the pigskin reconstruction, the . lower part of the pectoral muscle is teased off the ribs and the pigskin . tissue — which looks like thick, white rice paper — is stitched to the . bottom edge of the muscle. Next, the implant is inserted and the . muscle and pigskin is pulled down so it covers the implant completely; . finally, the patient’s skin is drawn down and stitched to where the . breast fold will be. It was first developed for use in general surgery such as hernia repairs and breast reconstruction in the U.S. and was granted approval for use in Europe in 2008. To date, 1,200 patients in the UK have had their breasts reconstructed in this way.","Kelly Cruse, 32, decided to have a double mastectomy after finding out she has an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer .

More than 50 per cent of Britons go online when they are in bed and trying to sleep, a new survey has revealed. Only 11 per cent of the people questioned said they had good quality sleep which could, in part, be because 24 per cent of people are ‘addicted’ to checking their emails and social media when they are in bed.

Jessica Ashton-Pyatt suffered two heart attacks after she vomited so violently her stomach ruptured in October last year . A teenager died after being admitted to a ‘chaotic’ casualty ward where nurses tried to use a vital piece of equipment upside down, an inquest heard. Jessica Ashton-Pyatt, 14, suffered two heart attacks after she vomited so violently that her stomach ruptured. Gravely ill, she was taken to scandal-hit Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire. But while a registrar and ambulance staff desperately tried to resuscitate her, two male nurses looked on, apparently ‘terrified’ and ‘overwhelmed’ by the situation. One of the nurses, a coroner was told, tried to use a so-called bone gun the wrong way to connect an intravenous drip. Instead of pointing the gun at Jessica’s leg, he pointed it directly at a doctor. There was also a vital delay because a defibrillator was not fully charged, while a subsequent investigation found that the A&E team lacked proper leadership. The hospital is run by the United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust (ULHT), which was recently put into special measures after being identified as one of a number of Trusts with an excessive number of patient deaths. Although the hearing in Boston was told that Jessica’s treatment did not play a role in her death, the Trust has apologised, saying ‘aspects of care’ did not meet the ‘high standards that we normally deliver’. Parents Nicola, 33, and 34-year-old Andy, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, are now considering legal action. The inquest on Friday also heard that Jessica (pictured) had suffered catastrophic injuries as a result of the mystery illness and little could have been done to save her . Mother Nicola Pyatt (pictured) said: 'I am disgusted and angry at the way staff at the hospital treated Jessica. Some of the staff were told to help with her resuscitation, and they stood by and watched like it was some sort of show' Following the hearing, Mrs Pyatt . said: ‘I am disgusted and angry at the way staff at the hospital treated . Jessica. Some of the staff were told to help with her resuscitation, . and they stood by and watched like it was some sort of show. Despite Jessica's inconsistent care, the coroner recorded a verdict of death by natural causes . ‘We went to the inquest in the hope we can get closure on our daughter’s death, but now we have even more questions.’ Jessica was rushed to hospital last . October after suffering severe stomach pains on holiday at Butlins in . Skegness, Lincolnshire, with a friend and the friend’s mother. By the time an ambulance arrived the teenager was vomiting blood from a ruptured stomach and she died hours later. Mark . Hall, a paramedic who administered CPR at the hospital, told the . hearing that two of the resuscitation team – described as possibly of . Indian origin – failed to get involved. One . of them, he said, used the bone gun – which allows fluids and medicines . to be introduced via bone marrow rather than a vein – in an ‘alarming . manner’ by attempting to put it in upside down. ‘I would describe it as chaos,’ said Mr Hall. ‘In my opinion they appeared overwhelmed by the serious situation.’ Friday’s hearing was told Jessica would not have survived the irreparable stomach condition.Pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton said he was ‘baffled’ as to what had caused the ruptured stomach. South . Lincolnshire Coroner Prof Robert Forrest, who recorded a verdict of . death through natural causes, said: ‘The treatment she received did not . save her life but did not contribute to her death.’ The coroner said he would raise some of the issues highlighted at the inquest with the chief executive of the hospital trust. United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust, which runs Pilgrim Hospital (pictured), issued a statement apologising for failings in Jessica¿s care. They said: 'We express our sincere condolences to the family of Jessica Ashton-Pyatt and apologise for any distress caused during her treatment' ULHT said that following an . investigation, medical staff must now ‘escalate cases to a consultant . when required’, while equipment is also checked thoroughly after use. In . 2011, the Nursing and Midwifery Council ordered trainee nurses out of . the Pilgrim Hospital after serious concerns were raised about the . quality of training.

Surgeons have used ground-breaking 3D technology to help rebuild a patient’s face after she developed a life-threatening tumour behind her eye. Ann O’Sullivan , 69, visited her GP about a sinus problem only to discover her headaches were actually caused by an aggressive tumour that had been spreading undetected across the left side of her face. Maxillofacial surgeons at St George’s Hospital, in Tooting, South London, had to remove a large portion of her jaw, her left eye, and numerous teeth to get rid of the cancer. Ann O'Sullivan had to have part of her jaw, her left eye and some of her teeth removed after doctors found a tumour spreading across her face. Image shows a 3D scan of her face . Once this procedure was complete, they began the painstaking work of reconstructing of her face using innovative computer technology to rebuild the damaged area. The technology allowed the team to electronically scan the opposite side of her face to build a 3D profile that surgeons could then replicate. Mrs O’Sullivan said: ‘I’ve always been healthy so it came as a shock when the doctor referred me to hospital where the scan revealed a tumour. The hardest thing to take was the loss of my left eye. ‘The surgeons told me it was just rotten luck but that I was lucky the tumour had been growing outwards rather than inwards. ‘My father died of cancer but I was told that many types of cancer were now curable as long as they are caught early enough.’ Mrs O'Sullivan said: ¿The hospital offered me a false eye but I don¿t want that. I¿m as fixed as I¿m going to be and that¿s good enough¿ . Mrs O’Sullivan underwent a ten-hour operation at the hospital’s specialist maxillofacial unit which specialises in reconstructive surgery including facial trauma, deformity and head and neck cancer. The operation involved surgeons taking a portion of bone from her leg to reconstruct her jaw, and a number of tissue grafts where arteries and veins had to be painstakingly re-connected using micro surgery. A complication saw Mrs O’Sullivan return to surgery a day later for a further ten hour operation before surgeons were satisfied that blood was circulating properly to the affected area. She said: ‘I can’t praise the staff enough. They kept me informed every step of the way and have been very caring and kind from the surgical team to the nurse who bought me a cup of tea in the small hours of the morning. ‘I put my faith in the hospital and they saved my life.’ Mrs O’Sullivan, who lives in Roehampton, says it took her a week before she had the courage to look at herself in the mirror. ‘I told myself it could have been worse and am now focused on getting on with my life. You have to be positive. ‘The hospital offered me a false eye but I don’t want that staring back at me every morning. I’m as fixed as I’m going to be and that’s good enough.’ Mrs O’Sullivan says her family have been a great source of support. Mr Kavin Andi, one of two surgeons involved in the operation, said: ‘It’s always satisfying to see a procedure go well and return people to their home environment so they can get on with their lives.’ Mr Andi and Mr Graham Smith, who was supported in theatre by a team of more than ten clinicians and nurses, said the use of 3D imaging meant much of the preparatory work was carried out ‘virtually’ on a computer so he knew exactly what needed to be done before going into surgery. He added: ‘We are lucky at St George’s because we are a world leader in this field of work. The 3D imaging means I can look at the tumour from different angles and take the necessary measurements including how and where bone is removed and re-sculpted. ‘I am particularly pleased because Ann was allowed to go home on the pre-agreed date, despite the extra operation.’ Mrs O’Sullivan is now undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the Royal Marsden, in Sutton.","Ann O'Sullivan had a large part of her jaw, her left eye and some of her teeth removed after a large tumour was found spreading across her face .

Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell raped a young girl in her bed after covering her mouth with her favourite teddy bear, a court heard yesterday. A jury was told that he even threatened the youngster with death if she mentioned the attacks, which he allegedly carried out over a nine-year period and told her was ‘our little secret’. ‘No one needs to know otherwise you’ll be taken, you’ll die and the evil will come over you,’ he is accused of saying. Start of trial: Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell in the dock at Manchester Crown Court while his alleged victim gives evidence behind a curtain yesterday . Ordeal: Le Vell shook his head as the girl behind the curtain sobbed giving evidence to the court yesterday . Le Vell, 48, who has played garage . mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV1 soap for 30 years, is facing a total . of 12 sex charges. He is accused of five counts of rape, three of . indecent assault, two counts of sexual activity with a child and two of . causing a child to engage in sexual activity. He denies all the charges. The . girl sobbed yesterday as she told a jury at Manchester Crown Court that . she had been repeatedly abused by the soap star from the age of six. On . one occasion the actor allegedly lay on top her and said: ‘It’s ok, . you’re safe. Just keep calm, stay asleep ... I’m going to get rid of . the evil.’ The 48-year-old is then accused of pulling down her pyjamas, covering  her mouth with the teddy bear and raping her in her bed. The . girl told the court that as she was raped Le Vell would talk to her. ‘He said I was safe and he was just getting rid of all the evil and all . the bad that was inside me,’ she said. ‘To stop me speaking he put one of my favourite teddy bears over my mouth so I could still breathe but not say anything.’ The . girl, who cannot be named, wept as she gave evidence from behind a . screen and said Le Vell simply walked away after the attack. End of the day: Le Vell, whose real name is Michael Turner, walks out of court through a crowd of photographers chewing on his lip . Exit: Le Vell is rushed from Manchester Crown Court after the . first day of his trial for a series of alleged child sex offences . Defendant: The actor, pictured being driven home, faces 12 charges of sex offences against children, including five counts of rape, three counts of indecent assault, two counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of causing a child to engage in sexual activity . ‘He just . got off me and kissed my left cheek and left,’ she said. ‘I was so in . shock it was like I was not even in my body. I was just motionless.’ The . attacks allegedly began when she was in primary school and continued . throughout her childhood until she finally told someone. The . girl, who is now a teenager, would speak only to her teddy bears about . the abuse. She said it disgusted her and left her feeling ‘upset and . dirty’. Le Vell, who was charged under his real name of Michael Turner,   shook his head as the charges were put to him. The . jury was told that the actor, who lives in Hale, Cheshire, was a . long-term heavy drinker who had previously sought help for his problem. He . went to a pub almost every night and would often drink seven or eight . pints of beer in one sitting. He once turned to Alcoholics Anonymous but . it had not helped and the heavy drinking continued. The . court heard that at the time the alleged abuse occurred Le Vell was . having serious marital difficulties with his wife, Janette, and they . were both under considerable strain. Denial: Le Vell in the dock where he pleaded not guilty to raping a young girl and 11 other charges . Accusations: The prosecution say Le Vell, whose . real name is Michael Turner, used threats to keep the silent, but he . says the alleged victim is a 'fantasist' and an 'attention seeker' Case: The prosecution, sketched with Le Vell watching on, told the court he was a 'heavy drinker' who abused the girl for eight years . The abuse was said to have taken . place at various addresses and ended a few years ago. The girl told the court that she was molested for months before the abuse escalated. She said Le Vell had threatened her not to tell anyone. ‘I . was very scared because it did not feel right. I did not know what to . believe or think,’ she said. ‘I would cry and cuddle my teddies and tell . them it doesn’t feel right but it must be.’ She . said on each occasion she felt removed from the actual abuse as if she . was outside her body watching down on herself and that Le Vell would . ‘stink’ of alcohol and cigarettes. ‘He smelt really, really bad with what I know now to be alcohol,’  she added. The girl said she became a ‘different child’ as a result of the alleged abuse, and felt ‘very confused’. Prosecutor . Eleanor Laws said the girl suffered years of nightmares and had wet the . bed until she was 12 because of the alleged abuse. Hearing: The jury was told that after one alleged attack he 'seemed happy', 'as if it was giving him pleasure' Attention: The actor listens to his alleged victim giving evidence from behind a screen to protect her identity . Throughout . the girl’s tearful testimony, which lasted for an hour and 45 minutes, . Le Vell sipped at water from a plastic cup and shook his head . repeatedly. Miss Laws said . Le Vell had first been arrested in September 2011 but the case was . dropped after an initial investigation. However it was reviewed by the . Crown Prosecution Service and the actor was re-arrested and charged in . February this year. Miss . Laws said: ‘He answered all questions put to him. He said that she was a . fantasist and an attention-seeker and this was just another of her . fantasies.’ Originally from . Manchester, Le Vell is one of the longest-serving actors on Coronation . Street, but has been suspended from the  ITV show until the conclusion . of the case. The jury was warned by the  judge to try the real Michael Le  Vell – and not the character he plays on screen. Before . the trial even began, Judge Michael Henshall asked if any of the . potential jurors felt they would not be able to try the actor due to . their interest in the soap opera. Interest: The Coronation Street actor is one of the most recognisable faces on television after more than 30 years in the soap . Surrounded: Le Vell speaks to a police officer guarding the court as the media swamped him yesterday as his trial started . ‘The man on trial is Michael Turner, not the character he  plays,’ he said. Judge . Henshall allowed the empanelled jurors a 15-minute break to decide . whether their  feelings about the ITV show would cloud their ability to . judge the evidence fairly. Two . jurors – both women – decided they would not be able to try him without . some sort of bias and were allowed to step down. Two others were chosen . in their place. Eleanor . Laws QC, prosecuting, then began the opening address, telling the jury: . ‘There is no room in your deliberations for any form of emotion or . sympathy or prejudice. You must judge the facts of this case using your . own common sense.’ The jury of eight women and four men will sit through up to two weeks of evidence before being asked to return a verdict. The case continues. Career: Le Vell's character Kevin Webster is one of the longest running and popular in British soap history .

George Osborne vowed yesterday that the controversial High Speed 2 rail project will go ahead despite fears over soaring costs. The Chancellor said he was ‘passionate’ about the planned high-speed rail line which will link London to the North of England and West Midlands. Costs of HS2 have hit nearly £50billion, including £7.5billion for rolling stock and £42.6billion for the infrastructure, which was up from the original estimates of £30billion in 2010. Business leaders –including the Institute of Directors – have branded it a ‘grand folly’, while Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor who backed the project in its early stages, has warned it is turning into a ‘nightmare’ and that its perceived benefits were ‘highly contentious’. HS2 is set to be constructed from 2017, and run 225mph trains from London to Birmingham by 2026 and on to Manchester and Leeds by 2032-3. But it has managed to provoke the ire of backbench Tories and residents along its proposed route, which also cuts through the Chilterns, an area of outstanding natural beauty. However, a defiant Mr Osborne said the rail project will heal the north/south divide. ‘I’m passionate about this project because time and again, we have this debate in our country about how we’re going to bring the gap between north and south together, about how we’re going to make sure that our growth is not just based on the City of London,’ he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. ‘High Speed 2 is about changing the economic geography of this country, making sure the North and the Midlands benefit from the recovery as well.’ Asked whether he would withdraw his support if costs hit £70billion or £90billion, he said: ‘We have set the budget for £42bn for the construction costs. That includes, by the way, a big contingency.’ He denied that costs were out of control and said HS2 could even come in under budget. ‘As we demonstrated with the Olympic Games, we can deliver these big projects actually under budget.’ Mr Osborne also defended his controversial ‘help to buy’ house buying scheme to help cash-strapped people onto the property ladder. The scheme allows people to borrow part of their deposit from the government at cheap interest rates, and allows families to buy homes in England with a deposit of just five per cent. But critics have warned the scheme would fuel the housing bubble and make property even less affordable for future generations. Long term benefits: HS2 is set to be constructed from 2017, and run 225mph trains from London to Birmingham by 2026 and on to Manchester and Leeds by 2032-3 . Adam Smith Institute director, Sam Bowman said: ‘It is crazy for the government to stoke demand even more without addressing supply and claim that this will help the housing market. 'Making taxpayer-subsidised handouts to homebuyers will only drive further house prices up, risking a bubble, improving access for a select few but making housing even more unaffordable for most people.’ The right-of-centre think tank will tomorrow publish a review of the scheme called Burning Down the House in which it will argue for planning laws to be liberalised to help developers build more homes. Mr Osborne denied that his home buying scheme risked fuelling prices, saying too much of the media and political debate was focused on what happened in London. ‘Outside the centre of London, actually there’s not some housing boom or some dramatic increase in house prices. 'There are many, many thousands of families watching this programme who can’t begin to afford the mortgage deposits that are required to buy a home. Former Labour Chancellor said the project has turned into a 'nightmare' and Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves (right) said George Osborne's mantra 'We're in this together' isn't true as house prices continue to soar . 'They aspire to own their own home, that’s a noble aspiration and I want to help them.’ Clutching a walking stick  for support, Andrew Marr returned to front his BBC politics show yesterday, nine months after a massive stroke. The broadcaster, 53, still has impaired mobility in his left arm and leg. He told viewers: ‘Well, here we are again. I have to start with a few “thank yous”, to all my excellent colleagues who have been keeping the show on the road. Thanks also to all the many viewers who’ve sent so many kind and wise messages.’ He dismissed claims that the recovery would be limited to house prices, saying it was ‘quite broadly based’. ‘Of course it’s in its early stages and although things are looking up, we mustn’t let up. We’ve got to absolutely go on doing the things necessary to fix what went wrong in our economy and this government’s got an economic plan to do that.’ Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury said: ‘George Osborne claims we are all in this together, but for ordinary people life is getting harder. 'Working people are worse off as prices continue rising faster than wages, yet millionaires have been given a huge tax cut. ‘As the Governor of the Bank of England has warned this is the slowest recovery on record, with almost one million young people out of work.’ She said Labour would bring in a new 10p lower rate of tax and invest more in infrastructure and building new homes.","Network will be constructed from 2017 and is designed to run services from London to Leeds .

Companies are accessing people’s private health information through their smartphone apps, it is claimed. The firms are harvesting information via popular health and fitness apps available in the UK including jogging app MapMyRun. The apps are used by fitness fans to track their exercise sessions and record information such as running times. Privacy problems: Many popular apps that record fitness levels are passing on information to insurance companies . Many will be unaware that their details are being passed on to companies including advertisers and digital analytic groups. Research published yesterday suggests that that the 20 most visited apps transmit information to a web of nearly 70 companies. The findings, by web analytics and privacy group Evidon, have been criticised by campaigners who said it presented a ‘stark warning’ to users of the apps. Emma Carr of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘With some applications’ terms and conditions reading longer than a Shakespearean play, it is no wonder that the developers are able to hide behind small print and legal jargon. ‘If people don’t understand what is happening to their personal information, how are they supposed to make an informed choice about whether to use a service? Hidden monitoring: Campaigners say the research presented a 'stark warning' to users . ‘The developers of these sorts of applications are putting their own interests before the privacy of their users, highlighting that consumers need proper protection from terms and conditions that are either too intrusive or too unclear to understand.’ The study comes after another investigation found creators of smartphone apps were not explaining privacy risk to customers properly. Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an advocacy group, found ‘considerable privacy risks’ not described in privacy policies when they analysed 43 popular health and fitness apps. The report read: ‘Consumers should not assume any of their data are private in the mobile app environment - even health data that they consider sensitive.’ The Evidon study found that information from MapMyRun, which allows joggers to record the length and pace of their running, is passed on to third parties. Data was passed to 11 different firms, including advertising companies, some of which are subsidiaries of Google, and other digital analytics and tracking groups. Experts are now warning that it may set a dangerous precedent and allow companies to use the information against people in future. Risk: The research showed that very few customers understood their details were being passed on to third parties . If health and fitness information were to be passed to insurance companies, they could use it to set premium prices. Leon Atkinson-Derman, chief executive of Winkpass Creations, maker of a menstrual cycle tracking app called iPeriod, said insurance companies were a real threat. He told the Financial Times: ‘If an insurance company were to want to buy iPeriod, I’d say no.‘The fact of the matter is, insurance companies are trying to learn things about people and use it against them.’ MapMyFitness, another exercise app, already earns half of its revenue from partnerships with insurance companies and says it benefits its users. It built a special platform for US-based company Humana, which mimics the fitness and calorie tracking features of MapMyFitness, the first of its kind for an insurance company. Humana offers this to the members of its employee health plans. When users meet certain fitness benchmarks, they are offered discounts on premiums or certain employers offer rewards such as holidays. Many of the app and third party companies say they do not sell information about their users and any user information transmitted is not personally identifiable. They say information is more typically used to improve their own apps. However, some companies, including iPeriod, are exploring ways of using personal data inputted into apps to target advertising at users. For example, a woman who records in the app that she gets headaches before her period could soon receive an ad for a pain reliever at just the right time of the month.","Experts fear that if health data is sold to insurance firms, they could use it to set premiums .

Warning: Mary Portas, posing for a picture outside Portcullis House, before facing MPs on the communities and local government select committee . Big chains will never return to the High Street due to the rise of online shopping, according to the government’s retail czar tasked with turning them around. Mary Portas, the self-styled Queen of Shops who carried out a review for ministers on how to rejuvenate town centres, admitted there had been a ‘tsunami’ of closures. She blamed ministers for not acting on her plans which included tax incentives for businesses to open in town centres, cutting red tape for  market traders and bingo nights. Miss Portas told MPs yesterday she was ‘naïve’ to think the government would act on her proposals and sometimes wished she ‘hadn’t put my name to it.’ She had written to the Prime Minister about the tepid response. Miss Portas said the proliferation of out-of-town supermarkets with free parking and cheaper online goods would kill chain stores in small and medium-sized towns. Despite more closures in ten out of the 12 towns where her plans were tried she said high streets could still be saved by ‘creative thinking, and different types of shops’. The Queen of Shops has also complained to MPs that it was 'unfair' that she had taken a 'bashing' for a review she carried for free for the government. It came after she was slammed as ‘nostalgic’ and ‘simply foolish’ by Bill Grimsey, the former boss of DIY chain Wilkes and supermarket group Iceland, who said her rescue scheme was ‘little more than a PR stunt’. Miss Portas was asked by David Cameron to suggest . ways to save the high street. Her . report, published in December 2011, was greeted with mixed reactions by . the sector. Today she appeared in front of a powerful body of MPs to answer questions . on how her recommendations are faring. But she insisted her report was more a 'catalyst for change' which had raised the profile of the problems high streets. ‘I am not the saviour of the high street,' she told MPs. 'I am a champion of it. I cannot do this on my own. ‘I believe in the high street and that they are an important social infrastructure and part of the community in this country. ‘I have taken a huge bashing for the work I have done for nothing. I think it is quite simply unfair.’ Criticism: Portas said she had taken a 'bashing' for a study she did for free in her own time . She added: 'I was travelling the country and seeing what was happening and because I work in consumerism and marketing I could see we were going to have a crisis that was going to hit. 'The high street has been in decline for the last 20 years.' Mr Grimsey will present an alternative report this week, in which he warns that 20,000 independent shops are at risk of closing down. But Miss Portas brushed off the criticism, joking: 'I must have done something to him in a previous life.' Bill Grimsey, (left) the former boss of DIY chain Wilkes and supermarket group Iceland, said Mary Portas’s (right) rescue scheme, which has been in effect for almost two years, was ‘little more than a PR stunt’ Mr Grimsey, who has spent the last three months writing his alternative review of the high street, said the Portas plans ‘promised the earth but delivered little’. Since her report was published eight household names, including Comet, HMV and Blockbuster, have all collapsed, leading to thousands of job losses, he said. In his rival report, to be published on Wednesday, he says: ‘It was clear to me that Portas failed to highlight to the Government the dramatic structural changes impacting the retail industry through the convergence of changing consumer behaviour driven by technology and brought about by the prevailing economic conditions.’ Yesterday he said: ‘When I set out to offer an alternative review of the high street, I knew our team had to start from a position that wasn’t clouded by sentiment...nostalgic dreams of a high street rebirth based on old-style bricks and mortar retailing are simply foolish.’ Instead, Mr Grimsey wants to use technology to help revive the high street. One of his 31 suggestions include an application for smartphones that lets the users see parking spaces and which stores have offers before going to shop. He also wants to reform business rates - a heavily-criticised tax on the industry - as well as making parking easier and appointing commissions that will be given the job of drawing up a 20-year business plan for their community. Mr Grimsey, who has spent the last three months writing his alternative review of the high street, said the Portas plans 'promised the earth but delivered little' Since her report was published eight household names, including Comet, HMV and Blockbuster, have all collapsed, leading to thousands of job losses, he said . He said: ‘We can’t rely on retailing to be the saviour of town centres any more. We need a more holistic solution.’ He added: ‘Our review is nothing to do with the magic notion of saving Britain’s high streets.’ When she launched her plan in December 2011, Mary Portas saw her suggestions derided. Lord Wolfson, a Tory peer and chairman of clothing chain Next, said that some of her recommendations were ‘downright dangerous’ and ‘economically naïve’. Philip Dorgan, a highly regarded analyst at broker Panmure Gordon said: ‘The headline ideas don’t seem to be that intelligent - it is all very bizarre - as though a GCSE student has written a report on the High Street.’ He added: ‘Will it revive the fortunes on the High Street? No, of course it won’t.’","Retail guru insists she is not a politician and cannot make change happen .

David Cameron’s standing as a world leader and Britain’s much vaunted ‘special relationship’ with America have both been badly hit by his Commons defeat over military strikes against Syria. And Ed Miliband has won approval for opposing the action. But the Prime Minister is applauded for giving MPs the chance to vote on the issue – and is still seen as much better at dealing with international crises than the Opposition leader, including by many Labour voters. Political capital: . Prime Minister David Cameron, left, is still seen as more of a statesman that Labour leader Ed Miliband, right, despite his humiliating defeat in the Commons after urging MPs to back an attack on Syria . That is the verdict of a Mail on Sunday poll on the row over whether the UK should support air strikes against the Syrian regime of President Assad by the US. Despite the bitter Commons clashes over Syria between Cameron and Miliband, there is no change in the party ratings, with Labour, on 37 per cent, maintaining an eight point lead over the Conservatives and the Lib Dems trailing UKIP. An overwhelming 65 per cent are opposed to UK raids on Syria, with only 19 per cent in favour, according to the Survation poll. However, that could change dramatically if Assad does not back down. Nearly one in two say they would support military action if Assad orders more mass chemical weapons attacks, with three in ten against. Barely one in five say the Prime Minister is in touch with public opinion over Syria, compared to nearly two in five who say Mr Miliband has judged the public mood correctly. But despite the doubts, four out of ten say they trust Mr Cameron in an international crisis, against just over two in ten who back  Mr Miliband. Worryingly for the Opposition leader, nearly one in six Labour supporters prefers Mr Cameron. A majority of 41 per cent say the Syria affair has damaged David Cameron’s global standing, compared to 38 per cent who say it has made no difference and seven per cent who say it has enhanced it. One in three also say it has damaged Britain’s so called ‘special relationship’ with the US, though nearly half believe it has made no difference. A clear majority say the Prime Minister spends too much time strutting the world stage, instead of fixing Britain’s problems. But more than half say Mr Cameron showed strength, not weakness, by letting MPs vote on the issue. And 43 per cent say the vote enhanced the reputation of Parliament, left in tatters by the expenses scandal, compared to 23 per cent who say the anti-war vote was bad for the reputation of the Commons. A total of 1,002 people took part in the Survation online poll, conducted on Friday.","The PM is applauded for giving MPs the chance to vote on the issue .

A relaxed and smiling Anne Darwin appears not to have a care in the world as she finishes a shift as a charity shop worker. The ex-wife of canoe conman John Darwin - who fled to Panama with her husband after he faked his own death in 2002, in a bid to claim almost £1million in life insurance and pension payouts - even took the time to exchange a few pleasantries with a passer by as she shut up shop for the evening. Having served half of a six year sentence for her role in the fraud, Anne, 61, looks to be relishing the chance to start her life a fresh. All smiles: Anne Darwin, 61, chats to a passer-by as she knocks off from her day job at an RSPCA charity shop . Shutting up shop: Anne Darwin puts the closed sign in the front of the RSPCA charity shop where she works five days a week . She is now said to be enjoying living in a one-bedroom apartment, a short bus ride from the RSPCA shop where she works five days a week. Meanwhile John, 62, is planning a fresh . start - possibly back in Panama. He also served three years of a . six-year jail term and was freed on licence in January 2011. A source close to Anne told the Mirror: 'She couldn't care if he sails off to Panama and never comes back.' Anne's neighbours know nothing of her background. Fresh start: Anne Darwin, left, is said to be enjoying starting out on a new life away from ex-husband John, right . Caught out: Anne Darwin is seen with ex-husband John in Panama despite the fact he was believed to be dead . According to the Mirror, one said: 'She leaves every day at the crack of dawn and walks a quarter of . a mile to catch the bus. She's lived here seven or eight months and . seems like a lovely lady. 'But she's very quiet. She talks to the people in the warden's office but doesn't really mix with anyone.' However, it's a different story for back-from-the-dead John who has told friends he plans to return to the central American country. Under his parole conditions the conman is banned from travelling abroad, but says he will leave Britain when the authorities return his passport to him in March. Scam: John Darwin's canoe was found floating on the water off this beach in Seaton Carew, Cleveland, but he wasn't dead at all . Plot: The house where John Darwin lived in secret through a wardrobe door before he took on a new identity .

Speaking . last night, MPs reacted with disbelief to a decision which caps a . shameful saga that leaves taxpayers saddled with a bill of up to . £500,000. John Woodcock, a Labour MP who represents Barrow and . Furness, said: ‘After a year of dithering over the investigation, . officers still haven’t come back with a clear case and so Stuart Hyde is . allowed effectively to come back in and then retire. 'It has been . an appalling waste of money and must have diverted the police from their . priorities, however much they tried not to' Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron . ‘At a time when numbers on the front line are reducing, we are pouring money into this pit of mismanagement.’ Liberal .

The officer, who had just returned from a . trip to Washington DC, was accused of serious misconduct, including . corruption. But while the inquiry ground on, Mr Hyde charted his travels . on his personal website. In August he posted pictures from Andorra . and from the villages of Saint Papoul and Lastours in the South of . France. In June, he went to the Isle of Man and in April posted pictures . from Mont Noir, on the Franco-Belgian border. Closer to home he toured . beauty spots across Cumbria and the Yorkshire Dales.

'I recognise fully the need to improve the way I manage myself and my accountability' Stuart Hyde . The inquiry by South Wales Police, which . took place as another chief was brought in from Merseyside to replace . him, concluded there was no evidence of misconduct. But it found that . Mr Hyde should be given ‘appropriate advice’ on a dozen issues from his . use of Twitter to his failure to provide receipts for spending on an . official credit card. Investigators highlighted how trips outside . Cumbria, including to overseas events, accounted for nearly a quarter of . his time over a nine-month period. They said the acting chief had an . ‘unconventional and unprofessional’ approach to business and did not . record some gifts and hospitality. Investigators also found Mr Hyde used . air miles accrued through his work to pay for personal flights to . Tunisia, a clear breach of guidelines. Photographs: Mr Hyde had already posted pictures of him swimming and riding up Mount Ventoux in Provence, which features in a stage of the Tour de France .

French intelligence has alleged that the Syrian regime launched an attack on August 21 involving 'massive use of chemical agents' which killed 281 people and that it could carry out other strikes of a similar nature in the future. The government published a nine-page synopsis today about Syria's alleged chemical weapons program that found at least 281 deaths could be attributed to the attack in areas outside Damascus. The analysis is based in part from dozens of videos culled by French intelligence services. French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Driant (left), French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius (centre) and French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault (right) pose today in Paris . President Francois Hollande has backed a call from President Barack Obama for a military strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad's government in retaliation for the attack. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault hosted lawmakers, his defense and foreign ministers, and intelligence and security officials on today to discuss Syria. Having announced over the weekend that he will seek congressional approval for military strikes against the Assad regime, President Obama's administration is now trying to rally support among Americans and their congressmen and senators. A meeting with Senator John McCain is meant to address concerns of those who feel Obama isn't doing enough to punish Syrian President Bashar Assad's government for an attack in the Damascus suburbs last month that the U.S. says included sarin gas and killed at least 1,429 civilians, more than 400 of whom were children.

President Barack Obama, right, meets with French President Francois Hollande, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington . On the other side of the spectrum, some Republican and Democratic lawmakers don't want to see military action at all. Obama's turnabout on Syria sets the stage for the biggest foreign policy vote in Congress since the Iraq war. On Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. received new physical evidence in the form of blood and hair samples that shows sarin gas was used in the August 21 attack. Kerry said the U.S. must respond with its credibility on the line. 'We know that the regime ordered this attack,' he said. 'We know they prepared for it. We know where the rockets came from. We know where they landed. We know the damage that was done afterwards.' Kerry's assertion coincided with the beginning of a forceful administration appeal for congressional support. On Capitol Hill, senior administration officials briefed lawmakers in private to explain why the U.S. was compelled to act against Assad. Obama is trying to convince Americans and the world about the need for action. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (right), pictured meeting with Iranian head of parliament's national security and foreign affairs commission, Aladin Borujerdi in Damascus, has vast stockpiles of poison gas, according to a French intelligence report . Responsibility: French agents say Assad's regime is behind the nerve gas attack in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus on August 21 . So far, he is finding few international partners willing to engage in a conflict that has claimed more than 100,000 lives in the past two years and dragged in terrorist groups on both sides of the battlefield. Only France is firmly on board among the major military powers. Britain's Parliament rejected the use of force in a vote last week. With Navy ships on standby in the eastern Mediterranean ready to launch missiles, Congress on Sunday began a series of meetings that are expected to continue over the next several days in preparation for a vote once lawmakers return from summer break, which is scheduled to end September 9. Meanwhile Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says the information the U.S. showed Moscow trying to prove that the Syrian regime was behind an alleged chemical weapons attack is 'absolutely unconvincing.' Lavrov said Monday 'there was nothing specific' in the evidence presented by Washington: 'no geographic coordinates, no names, no proof that the tests were carried out by the professionals.' He did not say what tests he was referring to. Syrian refugees are seen behind a fence at a detention centre in Bulgaria, where they have fled to from a civil war that has claimed more than 110,000 lives . Lavrov say U.S. officials said they cannot share with them all the evidence because some of it is classified. Today Russia's foreign minister said evidence of alleged chemical weapons use by the Syrian regime presented to Moscow by the U.S. and its allies is 'absolutely unconvincing'. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said 'there was nothing specific there, no geographic coordinates, no names, no proof that the tests were carried out by the professionals.' He did not describe the tests further. Lavrov brushed aside Western evidence of an alleged Syrian regime role. Russia, along with China and Iran, has staunchly backed Assad throughout the conflict. 'What our American, British and French partners showed us in the past and have showed just recently is absolutely unconvincing,' Lavrov said at Russia's top diplomatic school. 'And when you ask for more detailed proof they say all of this is classified so we cannot show this to you.' U.N. chemical inspectors toured the stricken areas last week, collecting biological and soil samples, but it is not clear when the will present their findings. The Syria conflict erupted in March 2011 as an uprising against Assad that quickly transformed into a civil war. More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed in the conflict.","The French government has published a nine-page synopsis about Syria's alleged chemical weapons program .

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 18:37 EST, 2 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:37 EST, 2 September 2013 . Pupils from poor white families are falling further behind boys and girls from ethnic minorities in their schooling, a think tank claimed yesterday. It said the performance of white British boys from the poorest families – already the lowest achievers – has slipped further over the past five years. They are now half as likely as boys from impoverished Chinese or Indian families to get good qualifications and far less likely to succeed than boys from the worst-off black Caribbean or African families. Educational underclass: White working class boys' grades have slipped even further behind their peers' White girls from worse-off families are also far adrift of their contemporaries in ethnic and cultural minorities, the analysis by the  Centre for Social Justice said. The CSJ blamed the low aspirations of poor white families, benefit dependency and the failure of schools to encourage white  children in the same way they have tried to help minority children. The report, from the pressure group founded by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, called for further and faster education reform to reverse the educational decline among poor white British children. Alongside the downward spiral among white pupils, the paper said four-year-old children are arriving at schools still in nappies and unable to speak and that at the age of five nearly one in eight children cannot write their own names. Christian Guy, director of the CSJ, said: ‘These figures are sobering. They suggest that despite much money and effort white working-class boys are in danger of becoming an educational underclass. Performance discrepancy: Girls from poor white British families are doing marginally better than their male counterparts but they are both falling behind . ‘We need to take a close look at the reasons behind this growing inequality and re-assess the measures we are taking to close the performance gap.’ The deepening failure of white boys in school was first noticed a decade ago and the widening gap is set out in figures for those on free school meals and who gain five A* to C GCSE grades, including English and maths. Only 26 per cent of white boys on free school meals reached the benchmark last year, compared to 40 per cent of black boys. Among all pupils who have free school meals, 36 per cent achieve good GCSE grades. More than two thirds of Chinese pupils from poor families hit the target mark and more than half of those from Indian or Bangladeshi families. Non-British whites from poor families, including boys whose parents come from Eastern Europe, have similar levels of achievement to black boys. Despite efforts under two governments to improve the performance, the gap has widened rather than narrowed. Widening gap: The underachievement of poor white children has become even more pronounced . White boys are 0.5 per cent down on their 2007 levels, while black boys are up by 3.9 per cent.Girls from poor white British families are doing marginally better, with 35 per cent hitting the GCSE target, compared to 41 per cent of all girls from poor backgrounds. Only Roma gypsy and Irish traveller children do worse than poor white British children. The report said that traditionally white working class families put a low value on education because high qualifications were not necessary to get jobs in industry. Their attitudes have lagged behind as the economy has been transformed. Worklessness in regions that were once heartlands of heavy industry has also taken its toll. The CSJ quoted a Midlands headteacher saying: ‘Families where generations of parents have been on benefits have created dependency and a lack of aspiration and ambition.’ The report also pointed to Ofsted findings that some schools had effective programmes for helping minority children but little for white British pupils in trouble. The report was drawn up by a group headed by Sir Robin Bosher, a former primary school head who now leads the Harris Federation of academy schools. He said: ‘Educational failure is too common in our current system. It affects disadvantaged children and makes reform urgent’, .","Poor British white boys less likely to succeed than nearly any other group .

It is not bulked up with anything - it is absolutely 100 per cent pure beef, with herbs and seasoning.'

During this time, her Honda Accord hit cyclist Anthony Hilson, 46, causing him severe head and chest injuries. Paramedics pronounced the married father-of-two dead at the scene. Lethal: Victoria McClure was found guilty of causing the death of Anthony Hilson by dangerous driving . Police arrested podiatrist McClure and she was later charged with causing death by dangerous driving. At her trial, she admitted causing death by careless driving but denied the more serious charge. However, . she was convicted by a unanimous jury verdict in just over three hours . after a four-day trial at Reading Crown Court last month. Judge Nicholas . Wood said: ‘You could and should have seen him. The jury was sure that . your driving fell far below what would be expected of a competent . driver. ‘He lost his life, a . wife lost a husband, the children lost a father. They will have to live . with your actions for the rest of their lives, as will you. ‘This . case is a tragic loss of life and shows the potential dangers of . looking at a satnav while driving, even at an average speed. ‘No . sentence I pass will equate or make up for the loss of life – the loss . of Mr Hilson’s life. No sentence I pass will put an end to their grief . or to your grief or remorse.’ Sentence: Victoria McClure leaving Reading Crown Court, where she was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving . McClure, . a mother of two, will serve half of her 18-month sentence and is banned . from getting behind the wheel for two-and-a-half years, after which she . must pass an extended driving test before her licence is returned. Alistair MacDonald, defending, said his client was of good character and . had given evidence in ‘pained anguish and distress’. ‘She . never disputed her driving caused the death nor did she say that she . was not at fault for the death of Mr Hilson,’ he said, adding that . excessive speed had not played a part in the crash. Character witnesses had testified that they would trust their children with her in a car. McClure, . of Charvil, Berkshire, appeared emotionless during the hearing. On . learning her sentence, she looked stunned and glanced towards her . husband in the public gallery before being taken from the dock to the . cells. Judge Wood said she . had accepted responsibility for her actions, telling officers at the . crash scene that it was ‘absolutely [her] fault’. When . she realised what had happened in the crash on the A4 near Reading last . September she ran from her car to try to help Mr Hilson. The judge told her: ‘Witnesses said you were in shock and very distressed and crying.

The addicts, Tracey Carter, 37, and Isabel Cristiano, 46, were caught with cocaine hidden in their underwear and private parts. Cavanagh, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine at Bristol Crown Court. The court heard that the gang distributed Class A drugs into Weston for two months in November last year.

Vodafone will avoid paying any UK tax on huge profits it will make after it sealed one of the largest corporate deals in history yesterday. But thousands of its shareholders will be hammered with a hefty bill on the windfall they will receive. The company is set to gain £84billion from selling its stake in US mobile phone company Verizon Wireless. But due to a loophole introduced under Labour, Vodafone cannot be forced to pay anything to HM Revenue and Customs. The deal will also provide Vodafone with additional cash to pursue its expansion ambitions in Europe . Shareholders – including a large number of pension funds – will receive more than £54billion from the deal. As well as a dividend, on which they will have to pay full tax, investors will also be given shares in Verizon Communications – the US giant which is buying the Verizon Wireless stake from Vodafone. MP Margaret Hodge said: ¿I don¿t understand how anyone can justify such a massive windfall without handing any of it to the Exchequer' They will face paying capital gains tax if they sell these shares. It means more than half a million private Vodafone shareholders will face a tax bill while the corporate giant will pay nothing itself in Britain. Higher rate taxpayers face paying at least 25 per cent of the dividend in tax, though some  basic and lower rate taxpayers may not be taxed at all. Companies that receive the dividends will not be taxed. MPs last night demanded Vodafone to ‘do the right thing’ and pay its ‘fair share’. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, who has led a probe into the tax affairs of Google, Starbucks and Amazon, said: ‘I don’t understand how anyone can justify such a massive windfall without handing any of it to the Exchequer. ‘If this is an instance in which Vodafone has simply played the system then clearly they themselves have an obligation to UK consumers, on whom they depend for their business, to do the right thing.’ The deal by Vodafone, to sell its entire US operations, is the third biggest in corporate history. It will offload its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless in a deal that is being structured through a holding company based in the Netherlands – although it is not clear whether this helps it avoid tax. Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao said: ‘This is not a situation that is comparable to Google and Starbucks. ‘Even if this deal happened in the UK . the rules in place for many years are the same as the Netherlands. There . is no taxable income for the company.’ It is not the first time the company has been embroiled in a tax scandal in the UK. Vodaphone shares jumped nearly 7 per cent after the sale was announced . Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao said the sale will mean a 'very substantial return to shareholders and to the investments relied upon by savers and pensioners' Last year the group was criticised for paying no corporation tax despite raking in profits of £294million on sales of more than £5billion. For years the company has used a host of tax breaks to cut its bill. Under rules that existed until 2002, Vodafone would have had to pay capital gains tax on the profits it had made while holding Verizon Wireless shares . But Gordon Brown, then Chancellor, introduced an exemption allowing firms that owned more than 10 per cent of another company to avoid paying capital gains tax when they sell.","It is one of the largest deals in corporate history but MPs are furious .

The Royal Navy’s new aircraft carriers could set sail without a crucial radar which warns commanders of incoming enemy warplanes and missiles. A damning report by MPs reveals the Crowsnest early warning system will not be ready until six years after the first of the £5.5billion Queen Elizabeth-class warships enters service in 2016. Delays in fitting the ‘eyes in the sky’ system to military helicopters until 2022 were a ‘concern’, the Commons’ Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says today. Concern: New aircraft carriers the HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, shown in this artist's impression, may be vulnerable to aerial attack . This risks leaving HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales without aerial coverage and vulnerable to attack when they are put to sea. The 65,000-tonne floating fortresses are due to be fully operational from 2020 meaning they could be deployed to trouble spots around the world. Last time the Navy did not have an airborne early warning system was in place was during the Falklands conflict in 1982 when five ships were sunk, with dozens of service personnel killed and hundreds injured. The cross-party committee - Parliament’s spending watchdog - also warns the cost of the aircraft carriers could spiral ‘uncontrollably’. The bill for the two new warships, given the green light in 2008, is almost twice the original £3.6billion - and there are ‘huge risks’ it will increase further, says the report. MPs heap criticism on the Coalition for wasting money after a U-turn over the type of warplanes to fly from the aircraft carriers. In 2010 ministers controversially decided to scrap the last Labour government’s plans to buy a fleet of jump jets, which take off and land vertically. Instead, Prime Minister David Cameron ordered conventional versions of the US-built F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that would need catapults and arrester gear to take off from and land on the vessels. On target: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond says that Crownest is expected to be working by the first operational service . But this was based on ‘deeply flawed information’, say the committee. When the cost of fitting the ships with ‘cats and traps’ more than doubled to £2billion, Mr Cameron flip-flopped and returned to buying the jump jet. The move cost a staggering £74million in squandered in lost man hours, administrative costs and needless planning. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, the PAC’s chairman, said: ‘The Committee is still not convinced that the MOD has this programme under control. It remains subject to huge technical and commercial risks, with the potential for further uncontrolled growth in costs.’ Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘Crowsnest is expected to deliver an initial capability by the time the first carrier is in operational service. ‘Maritime surveillance will also be provided by other platforms and systems.’ He said the Ministry of Defence ‘acted swiftly’ to switch back to the jump jet as soon as it became clear ‘the alternative would cost more money’. The Coalition left Britain without carrier strike when it controversially scrapped the iconic Harrier jump jets in 2010 as part of defence cuts. Labour defence spokesman Kevan Jones said: ‘The chaos of the Government’s carrier u-turn gets worse and worse. ‘David Cameron has cost the taxpayer millions of pounds and has left the country without aircraft on an aircraft carrier for a decade. When defence budgets are tight, this looks incompetent and wasteful.’","HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales risk entering service without aerial coverage and vulnerable to attack when they are put to sea .

Paternity leave rules which give fathers only two weeks off work are ‘Edwardian’, Nick Clegg said yesterday, as he said parents should share up to a year at home with their newborn. The Deputy Prime Minister said he wanted more fathers to help with the ‘heavy lifting’ of childcare if mothers choose to return to work earlier. In a defence of working parents, he said both mothers and fathers would be able to ‘chop and change’ blocks of up to 12 months leave between them, under the Government’s plans to ‘revolutionise’ childcare by 2015. Crazy: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg attacked paternity leave rules as he met two-year-old Sienna-Leigh at the Mace Montessori nursery . At present, mothers have six months maternity leave at full pay, but can take up to 12 months off. Mr Clegg was speaking as he confirmed the number of two-year-olds receiving . free childcare will double as a government scheme is extended to working . families on low incomes. From today, 130,000 youngsters - 20 . per cent of two-year-olds - will be eligible for funding because their . families qualify for Free School Meals or they are looked after by their . local authority. Mr Clegg has revealed that next September, the number . will rise to 260,000, or 40 per cent of the cohort. But speaking on a visit to the Mace Montessori nursery in London today, he also took aim at 'crazy' rules which meant new fathers could only take two weeks from work. He told reporters: 'We are revolutionising parental leave so it is not paternity leave anymore, it becomes parental leave. 'You and your wife or partner will be able to chop and change, and exchange the block of leave that presently is afforded to the mother through maternity leave, as you wish.' Child's play: Mr Clegg did his best to win over the toddlers, including two-year-old Alice at the Mace Montessori nursery . Mr Clegg went on: 'I know plenty of women who feel that they want to go back to work earlier than their partners or their husbands do, that’s just the way families are, obviously that’s great. 'But we’ve got these Edwardian rules - I’ve experienced it myself three times. 'It’s crazy that when your child is born you’ve got just a couple of weeks, when in a sense you’re least relevant to the child, because they’re barely aware that you’re there.' He said it 'makes much more sense' for new dads 'to be able to maybe do some of the heavy lifting in those early months'. Mr Clegg added: 'All the evidence is overwhelming that it has a very profound bonding effect not just but especially a powerful effect for boys as they grow up.' Help: Under the childcare plans, parents who qualify will be able to claim up to 15 hours a week of free early education for their child . Mr Clegg was forced to defend the government's childcare plans from charges it penalised stay-ay-home mothers. The scheme is being opened up to families that earn less than £16,910 a year and receive working tax credits. Children who have been adopted, are in care or have a disability or special educational needs will also benefit from next year. The Coalition is investing £534million in the scheme this year, rising to £760million in 2014/15. Parents who qualify will be able to claim up to 15 hours a week of free early education for their child. But critics claim funding is not availble to parents who do not work. Mr Clegg said: 'Of course if we had pots and pots of gold, it would be lovely go give everyone universal entitlement to everything. 'But we can’t, we have a limited amount of money and we have to take decisions and our view is that when designing the tax-free childcare offer that will be made available from 2015 we need to start and focus in particular on those families where mothers – it’s usually mothers but fathers sometimes as well – tell us that they would like to work, if only they were given extra support with childcare costs.' Mr Clegg outlined the overhaul in a speech today, stressing that the government is helping more children achieve a ‘brighter start in life’ He said: ‘All the evidence shows that if you take two children - two five-year-olds hanging up their coats next to each other on the first day of school - the poorer child will already be behind their better off classmate before a single lesson has been taught. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has revealed that next September, the number will rise to 260,000 . ‘Without this help, children suffer and the whole class suffers as teachers have to focus more of their efforts on children who are frustrated and left behind through no fault of their own. ‘I believe that every British family, whatever its structure, background and circumstances, should be able to get on in life.’ The free childcare entitlement for two-year-olds was announced in the 2010 spending review. From last September, ten trial areas including Blackpool, Cornwall, Greenwich, Kent, Lambeth and Newcastle introduced the scheme, benefiting almost 1,000 two-year-olds. Speaking at the time, Mr Clegg said that parents would be given the option to spread their free nursery place over two days, rather than three, and to use the free hours between 7am and 7pm rather than 8am to 6pm. This was intended to make it easier to fit the childcare around working lives. The Pre-school Learning Alliance yesterday welcomed the expansion but warned that the scheme would not achieve its goal of giving two-year-olds a good start in life without proper funding. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the alliance, said: ‘From taking part in the pilot scheme for two-year-olds, we are acutely aware that many of these young children from struggling families will have additional needs requiring specialist one-to-one help. ‘Indeed, from our experience, we estimate that the true cost of providing such care could be double the amount per place the government has allocated.’ He said that the early years sector ‘fully supported’ the government plans but was wary of getting involved because many child carers have provided free places at a loss under a similar scheme for three and four-year-olds. He added: ‘The free early years entitlement scheme for three and four-year-olds has been historically underfunded by successive governments. ‘We cannot afford such underfunding to continue indefinitely and trust that now the government is extending the scheme to this younger age group that the higher costs of providing care to these children will be recognised and fully met.’ Anand Shukla, chief executive of the Family and Childcare Trust, warned that nursery closures could impede the delivery of free childcare. He said: ‘We are concerned that loss of nursery provision in children’s centres is impacting on local authorities’ ability to find sufficient places for the offer.’ New research by the Family and Childcare Trust - to be published this month - indicates that a minimum of 108 nurseries across England have closed or were never commissioned as they were supposed to be . Mr Shukla added: ‘Cost savings have driven nursery closures and this approach reduces capacity in the system which will damage government hopes of meeting its targets for provision of childcare for two-year-olds.’","From today 20 per cent of two-year-olds will be eligible for funding .

Hospital wards will have to earn ‘kitemarks’ to prove they properly care for the elderly. Senior doctors are drawing up a new system which will see wards judged on their treatment of older patients. It follows widespread concern that the elderly are frequently neglected by staff in hospital with food and drink left out of reach. Senior doctors are drawing up a new system which will see wards judged on their treatment of older patients . Doctors are also concerned that the elderly are routinely shipped between wards like parcels and initially put whenever there is a bed, only to be hurriedly made to move in the middle of the night because someone else needs the slot. Starting next Spring, the Royal College of Physicians will judge hospital wards on the quality of care for elderly patients and the best will be given ‘elder friendly’ badges. Hospitals will be urged to nominate wards and the College will consider whether staff put patients first and treat them with dignity and respect. It will look at both surveys of patients and their relatives and representatives from the College may also visit wards to monitor how nursing staff and doctors behave. Dr Patrick Cardigan Registrar of the Royal College of Physicians said achieving gold standard care for the elderly must be a priority . The new system was prompted by the Mid Staffordshire scandal where hundreds of patients – mainly elderly - are feared to have died through neglect between 2005 and 2009. Earlier this year a major public inquiry called on senior doctors and nurses to make crucial changes to their working practices to prevent the disaster ever being repeated elsewhere in other hospitals. Dr Patrick Cadigan, registrar at the College said: ‘Many of the instances of substandard care at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation trust took place in medical wards caring for our most vulnerable patients – frail older patients with complex comorbidities (a range of conditions). ‘Achieving gold standard care for this group must be the priority. ‘It will make substantial contribution to ensuring that the events at Mid Staffordshire are never repeated.’ But the College has also warned that due to a shortage of hospital beds, the elderly are frequently shunted around wards ‘like parcels’ to wherever there is room. A patient brought in following a fall for example fracture might be placed on a stroke ward or one that specialises in kidney failure as there is no other room. But when someone else is admitted later on for a stroke or kidney disease they are hurriedly moved – often in the middle of the night – to wherever else in the hospital there is a bed. Starting next Spring, the Royal College of Physicians will judge hospital wards on the quality of care for elderly patients and the best will be given ¿elder friendly¿ badges . This may happen three or four times during their stay in hospital which could last two weeks. It is highly distressing for the patient – particularly if they suffer dementia – and means the doctors and nursing staff to not get to know them or learn their needs. The College has calculated that the moves are such a setback for the patients’ recovery that each one adds another two days onto their stay in hospital.","Senior doctors are drawing up new system which will see wards judged on their treatment of older patients .

Criticised: Labour leader Ed Miliband has been attacked over his stance on Syria, with William Hague saying it has caused consternation around the world . Deep splits were appearing in Labour’s position on Syria last night, as it emerged world leaders have voiced ‘serious concerns’ about Ed Miliband’s stance. William Hague claimed that the Labour leader’s politicking on Syria had caused consternation around  the world. ‘There’s some serious concern in other capitals, not just across the Atlantic,  but in European capitals as well about the position they’ve taken about voting down a government motion that actually had everything in it that they asked for,’ he told Sky News. A Foreign Office source added:  ‘Washington and Paris have been very unimpressed indeed and they are not the only ones.’ Leading Labour figures appeared divided over the issue of Syria yesterday, with some ruling out support for any military strike while others appeared to want to keep options open. Echoing comments made by the former leader Tony Blair, former Labour culture secretary Ben Bradshaw voiced concern about signs that Labour was turning its back on the world under Mr Miliband’s leadership. Commenting on the Syria vote, he said: ‘I would be very worried if this signals a retreat from Labour being an internationalist party willing to do difficult things to make the world a better place.’ Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said that, despite Labour’s demand for more ‘evidence, he had ‘no doubt’ that tyrant Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons and would use them again. Mr Murphy, one of a number of Labour frontbenchers who appeared to be nodding agreement with Mr Cameron as he laid out the case for intervention last week, also said the Prime Minister should not rule out a second Commons vote. Concerns: Ben Bradshaw, left, said he was worried the move could signal Labour's retreat as an international party while Jim Murphy said a second vote on intervention should not be ruled out . He said: ‘If there were to be really significant developments in Syria, and the conditions that we set in our motion on Thursday about it being legal, about the evidence being available, compelling evidence about a UN process, then of course the Prime Minister has the right to bring that back to Parliament.’ But the shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander suggested Labour would hold Mr Cameron to his word on Syria, regardless of developments in the country’s bloody civil war. Unhappy: Meg Munn was one of the few Labour MPs to vote with the Government. She said she blamed both leaders for getting Britain into its current position . ‘The Prime Minister has given his word now to the British people that the UK will not be participating,’ he said. ‘If he was now to return to the Commons and say well actually because the President of the United States has decided to go to the Congress, I’ve changed my mind about what Parliament was saying and what the British people were saying, I think that would weigh very heavily on the ability for him to convince the public or Parliament that his judgement was sound.’ Mr Miliband insisted Labour’s actions had not damaged the ‘Special Relationship’ with the United States. But the party’s anti-intervention stance has appalled some senior Labour figures. Lord Mitchell, who serves as an adviser on business to Mr Miliband, said: ‘We should take military action against Syria. Assad and his cronies are unspeakable. Why us? Because we stand for decency.’ Former Foreign Office minister Meg Munn, one of the few Labour MPs not to vote against the Government, said Mr Miliband had to take his share of the blame for the fact Britain now looks highly unlikely to back punitive action against Assad over his use of chemical weapons. ‘I think both leaders bear a responsibility for getting us into this position,’ she said. Jim Murphy yesterday admitted he had sworn at Michael Gove in the immediate aftermath of the Commons vote on Thursday night. The shadow defence secretary is reported to have shouted, ‘F*** off you bully’, at the education  secretary after he accused Labour MPs of appeasing Assad. Commenting on the incident yesterday, Mr Murphy said: ‘I used industrial language that my priest would not be proud of.’","William Hague claims Labour leader's politicking has caused consternation .

Peter Thomas Maine, 56, from Wynyard, Stockton-on-Tees, who was found dead with stab wounds near a sports centre in Durham City yesterday morning . A solicitor who faced being struck off over ‘dubious’ transactions has been found stabbed to death. Peter Thomas Maine, 56, was found dead just four months after being told he would be prosecuted before the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal. Police have launched a ‘murder-style’ investigation after the father-of-two was discovered near a popular running track on Sunday morning. It is understood he sustained fatal stab wounds but police have not found the weapon that inflicted the injuries. They are currently treating the death as ‘suspicious’ but ‘unexplained’ and do not yet know whether a third party was involved. Mr Maine lived with his wife Joanna, 53, in Wynyard, a leafy gated estate in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham. Their £650,000 house is near the palatial mansion which Dragon’s Den star Duncan Bannatyne recently put on the market. The couple have two grown-up daughters, Lucy, 25, and Jessica, 22.

Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer has unexpectedly announced his retirement, ending a 13-year reign at the head of the world's largest software company and sending the company's shares up nearly 6 per cent. Ballmer, 57, took over from co-founder Bill Gates in January 2000, but his leadership was questioned throughout his tenure by Wall Street and Silicon Valley, as Microsoft's stock price floundered. The company that drove the personal computer revolution has been overtaken in recent years by the likes of Apple and Google in the shift toward mobile computing. Microsoft chief sxecutive Steve Ballmer, pictured, has announced his retirement, ending a 13-year reign at the head of the world's largest software company. Ballmer will stay in his position for the next 12 months as the company searches for his replacement . There are no obvious candidates to succeed Ballmer at the company that has only had two CEOs in its 38-year history. Only last month Ballmer launched a reorganisation to reshape Microsoft into a company 'focused on devices and services'. Some industry watchers felt it was too little, too late in the effort to restore Microsoft as a technology leader. 'Since he took over in 2000, it is fair to say he missed a number of transitions: mobile, tablets, cloud,' said Zeus Kerravala, an analyst at ZK Research. 'Microsoft continues to live off traditional PC computing. Ballmer's strength is traditional PC computing. Ballmer was born in 1956 and grew up just outside Detroit. His father was a manager at the Ford motor company. Ballmer graduated from Harvard with a degree in mathematics and economics. He worked for two years at Procter & Gamble as an assistant product manager before dropping out of Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1980 and joining Microsoft. Ballmer was the first business manager to be employed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. In February 1992 he become executive vice president, Sales and Support before being made president of Microsoft from July 1998. In January 2000, Ballmer was officially named chief executive officer while Gates stayed on as chairman of the board. During Ballmer's time as CEO Microsoft has more than tripled revenues and doubled profits. 'He was a great guy for his era but times have changed and a new leadership is needed. It's hard to say his tenure has been a success.' Ballmer has tripled Microsoft's revenues and more than doubled its profits since he became CEO, yet the company's share price has stayed relatively steady and flat over the last decade. Shares peaked in late 1999 at a split-adjusted high of $59.97 but has failed to achieve this level since. Following Ballmer's note to employees announcing his departure, Microsoft shares rose 5.7 percent to $34.26 on Nasdaq. Ballmer is to retire within the next 12 months, once a special committee has selected a new CEO. Although he has faced criticism for some time, his decision to retire surprised analysts. Microsoft shares rose 5.7 percent to $34.26 on Nasdaq on Friday, seen here as the peak on the chart, following Ballmer's note to employees detailing his retirement . 'Yes, this was a surprise, especially considering how close it is to the recently announced strategic overhaul towards devices and services,' said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen. Ballmer himself acknowledged his decision was abrupt. 'There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time,' he wrote in a memo to employees. 'This is an emotional and difficult thing for me to do. I take this step in the best interests of the company I love.' Ballmer said in a statement he had originally considered retiring in the middle of the reorganisation, but eventually decided 'we need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction.' The committee to select a new CEO is to be chaired by John Thompson, the board's lead independent director, and includes Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates, as well as other board members Chuck Noski and Steve Luczo. It will consider both external and internal candidates and work with executive recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles International, according to Microsoft.

Sophie Chou has found people who have a realistic sense of optimism are more likely to be happy and successful . A scientist has discovered it is beneficial to be a glass-half-full person. Sophie Chou has found people who have a realistic sense of optimism are more likely to be happy and successful than people who are pessimistic or wildly optimistic. The psychology researcher believes realistic optimists' positive outlook, combined with their rational perspective on life tend to be very successful. A realistic optimist is defined as someone who looks on the bright side of life but has a realistic grasp on the present and what to expect in life. She said realistic optimists use their realism to perform well at work and in exams, while their positive outlook enables them to dodge periods of depression and helps them spot opportunities. Ms Chou, an organisational psychology researcher at National Taiwan University, shared her findings at a meeting of the American Psychological Association in Hawaii this month. While past research has shown optimists value thoughts that make them feel good,  pessimists have a more 'truthful' view of themselves and a realistic view can sometimes lead natural pessimists to suffering depression, LiveScience reported. Another study concluded that optimists tend be in better health and live longer. However, Ms Chou noticed that some people were both optimistic and realistic as well as being very successful, leading her to question whether a sense of optimism and pessimism are in opposition to one another. She questioned 200 college and graduate students about the 'positive illusions' they held as well as whether they were motivated by reality or becoming a better person. Realistic optimists got better grades than their more aspirational peers, perhaps suggesting that those lacking a realistic outlook deluded themselves they could do well without working hard, according to the study . Ms Chou found optimists could be divided into idealists and realists. She said: 'Realistic optimists tend to choose accuracy over self-enhancement; the unrealistic optimists tend to choose self-enhancement.' The realistic optimists got better grades than their more forward-thinking aspirational peers, perhaps suggesting those lacking a realistic outlook deluded themselves they could do well without working hard, Ms Chou said. Her study challenges conventional beliefs that a realistic outlook goes hand-in-hand with greater depression and instead shows realistic optimists are happy people. Ms Chou thinks this might be the case as realistic optimists believe they have more control over themselves and their destinies, including in relationships and at work. The research suggests realistic and unrealistic optimists might have very different personality types. Ms Chou thinks this might be the case because realistic optimists think they have more control over themselves and their destinies, including in relationships and at work . She said: 'Every time they face an issue or a . challenge or a problem, they won't say ""I have no choice and this is the . only thing I can do."" They will be creative, they will have a plan A, . plan B and plan C.' The psychology researcher said their balanced outlook allows optimistic realists to stay upbeat about the future, while recognising and overcoming present challenges. However, Ms Chou warned people with this personality type are more prone to anxiety than more unrealistic people, probably because they recognise the chance of failure. The research also suggests that realistic and unrealistic optimists might have very different personality types.","A psychology researcher believes .

Hackers have discovered a way of sneaking dangerous and malicious software onto Apple's App Store by tricking the store's reviewers into thinking its safe. The app, dubbed Jekyll after the character in Robert Louis Stevenson's famous book in which Dr Jekyll has an evil alter ego called Mr Hyde, can be made to look like a harmless game, service, utility app and so on. Once it has passed Apple's strict app review policy, the computer scientists from the  Georgia Institute of Technology who developed the technique can remotely change its binary code to make it malicious. Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology have developed an app that tricks Apple into accepting it on the App Store, pictured, by convincing reviewers its safe. Once the app has been accepted, the designers can tweak its code to make it malicious and carry out attacks to steal people's data, for example . The findings were published in the paper, Jekyll on iOS: When Benign Apps Become Evil. Researchers Tielei Wang, Kangjie Lu, Long Lu, Simon Chung, and Wenke Lee said: 'The key idea is to make the apps remotely exploitable and subsequently introduce malicious control ﬂows byrearranging signed code. 'Since the new control ﬂows do not exist during the app review process, such apps, namely Jekyll apps, can stay undetected when reviewed and easily obtain Apple’s approval. 'We implemented a proof-of-concept Jekyll app and successfully published it in App Store. We remotely launched the attacks on a controlled group of devices that installed the app. 'The result shows that Jekyll app can successfully perform many malicious tasks, such as stealthily posting tweets, taking photos, stealing device identity information, sending email and SMS, attacking other apps.' As well as sending messages and stealing ID numbers, the app was also used to open malicious websites on the device's built-in Safari browser. The app was dubbed Jekyll after the character in Robert Louis Stevenson's famous book from 1886. In the book Dr Jekyll has an evil alter ego called Mr Hyde . To be accepted onto the App Store, apps must be functional in that they must not crash, include hidden features or work in a way other than what the developer advertised. They must also have a user function and developers can't charge for app that doesn't do anything. Any app that is defamatory, offensive, mean-spirited, or likely to place the targeted individual or group in harms way will be rejected. Apps that present excessively objectionable or crude content will be rejected along with apps that are designed to upset or disgust users. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr told MIT Review that . developers have made changes to the iOS in response to the Institute's . research although it's not known if the flaw has been completely fixed. Apple has a strict policy on which apps are accepted onto its App Store. It doesn't allow malicious or dangerous apps or apps that contain adult content, but it will also reject apps that don't appear to have a set use or function. This is to avoid rogue apps from appearing on the store. All apps are additionally run inside what's called the iOS sandbox, which isolates individual apps and prevents them from being able to communicate with other apps or other built-in programs. This is supposed to mean that if one app becomes infected, it can't hijack the others, yet the Georgia Institute of Technology's research even managed to bypass this feature.","When the app is submitted for review to Apple it appears to be safe .

The lives of British agents may have been put at risk by a Guardian journalist’s possession of top-secret documents stolen from the US  government, a senior Cabinet adviser has warned. Documents seized from the reporter’s boyfriend, David Miranda, were so sensitive that agents have since had to be moved to protect their lives. Oliver Robbins, deputy national security adviser at the Cabinet Office, went on the record to warn that ‘lives may be put at risk’ if the documents fall in to the wrong hands. Mr Farmer was registered blind after suffering two strokes. His walking stick is slightly reflective, which is why perhaps members of the public mistook it for a weapon . Court papers released yesterday also . revealed the incredibly lax security used around the material, with Mr . Miranda apparently carrying a password for some of the computer . documents written on a scrap of paper. Security . sources also said that, as a result of the theft, codes for tens of . thousands of sensitive documents have had to be changed. Details . of the chaos caused at the highest levels of Britain’s security and . intelligence agencies by the leaks emerged in official court submissions . about material seized from Mr Miranda, the boyfriend of Guardian . journalist Glenn Greenwald. Mr . Miranda, 28, who is Brazilian, was detained at Heathrow on August 18 as . he passed through the airport on his way from Berlin to Rio. He . was found to be carrying nine hard disks and memory sticks including . secret files leaked by former CIA analyst Edward Snowden, and was . questioned for nine hours before being released. Mr Miranda’s detention under terrorism powers provoked outrage from civil liberties groups. But . the newspaper’s initial story described him only as Mr Greenwald’s . boyfriend, and made no mention of the fact that he was carrying secret . material or that the Guardian was paying for his flights. Despite . only decrypting one third of the material, police have already . discovered 58,000 classified documents, many marked secret or top . secret. Mr Farmer was walking down the street on his way to meet friends when he was attacked. He was handcuffed by police before they realised their mistake He received treatment at hospital shortly after the incident . In a statement to . the High Court, Mr Robbins said the material was likely to contain . details of secret techniques used to prevent terror attacks, personal . data about agents at home and abroad and ‘other intelligence activities . vital to UK national security’. The . release of the information could pose a ‘direct threat to the life of . UK government employees’, as well as threaten the lives of their . families. Mr Robbins warned . the judges – who granted additional powers to the police to examine the . classified material – that the information that had been decrypted ‘has . had a direct impact on decisions taken in regard to staff deployments . and is therefore impacting operational effectiveness’. He . wrote: ‘The material seized is highly likely to describe techniques . which have been crucial in life-saving counter-terrorism operations, and . other intelligence activities vital to UK national security. The . compromise of these methods would do serious damage to UK national . security, and ultimately risk lives.’ A police officer demonstrates the Taser stun gun which releases 50,000 bolts of electric current when fired . He added: ‘A particular concern for HMG is the possibility that the identity of a UK intelligence officer might be revealed.’ GCHQ, . the Government’s communications headquarters, and the police are using a . large amount of resources to decrypt and process the material, Mr . Robbins said. He warned of . the urgent need to identify what other material is on the hard drives . ‘to assess the risks to sensitive intelligence sources and methods, and . the threat to intelligence agency staff should their identities or . details of their operational tradecraft be obtained by hostile actors’. Mr . Robbins said the Guardian’s publication of details from the documents . had already caused ‘real and serious damage’ to national security. Alan Rusbridger, the editor of  the Guardian, branded his claims ‘unsubstantiated and inaccurate’. He . said: ‘The Guardian took every decision on what to publish very slowly . and very carefully and when we met with government officials in July . they acknowledged that we had displayed a “responsible” attitude. ‘The .

A teenager convicted for the gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman on a moving bus in Delhi has been jailed for just three years. The defendant, who was 17 at the time of the attack, was given the maximum sentence possible under Indian law. But despite having since turned 18, the attacker will not be publicly named. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Convicted: The teenager was escorted by Indian policeman to court wearing a pink hood to hide his identity . Punishment: Three years is the maximum sentence possible for the crime under Indian law . The crime, which left the victim with such extensive internal injuries that she died two weeks later, sparked widespread protests across the country and led to reforms of India's antiquated sexual violence laws. The victim's family called for the teenager to be tried as an adult, accusing him of being the most violent of the attackers. 'He . should be hanged irrespective of whether he is a juvenile or not. He . should be punished for what he did to my daughter,' said the . mother of the victim, said soon after the verdict was announced. 'You may as well set the juvenile free, . if the sentence is only three years for heinous offences like rape and . murder,' she added tearfully. The mother also said she would appeal against the verdict in a higher court. 'I . am not happy with this judgment. At least in this case, the juvenile . should have been sentenced to life,' the victim's brother told Reuters news agency. The government, facing immense public pressure, had promised swift justice in the case. The convicted defendant was one of six people accused of tricking a 23-year-old medical student and her male companion into boarding an off-duty bus on December 16 after they had seen an afternoon showing of 'Life of Pi' at a shopping mall. Anger: Indian women participate in a silent procession to mourn the death of the gang rape victim . Fury: Protesters demanded swift justice in the case and wide-ranging reforms to sex crime laws . Horrific: The girl was savagely attacked when she boarded a bus with a male friend after a trip to the cinema in December . Anger: The savage assault caused outrage throughout India. Protestors are pictured trying to break through a police cordon during a demonstration in New Delh . A dream destroyed: A man bows his head at a candlelit vigil for the 23-year-old student who died after being gang-raped on a moving bus in New Delhi . Police say the men raped the woman and used a metal bar to inflict massive internal injuries to her. They also beat her male companion. The victims were dumped naked on the roadside, and the woman died from her injuries in a Singapore hospital. Four of the other defendants are being tried in a special fast-track court in New Delhi and face the death penalty. The sixth accused was found dead in his jail cell in March. The court is expected to hand down the rest of the verdicts next month. The convicted defendant was tried as a . minor on charges including murder and rape. The time he spent in a . juvenile home since he was arrested in December will count as part of . his three-year sentence. Terror: The 23-year-old woman died after being gang raped by six men who also used a metal bar to cause massive internal injuries . The sentence is likely to cause further anger in a country attempting to . turn a rising tide of violence against women and which has passed a new . law toughening sentences for adults convicted of sex crimes . The attack set off furious protests across India about the treatment of women in the country where police say a rape is reported every 20 minutes. A government panel set to suggest reforms to sexual assault laws rejected calls to lower the age at which people can be tried as adults from 18 to 16. On July 17, India's top court also refused to reduce the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16 years. However, it later agreed to hear a new petition seeking to take the 'mental and intellectual maturity' of the defendant into account and not just age. Four of the teenager's co-accused are still on trial and face the death penalty if convicted. Closing arguments began on August 22 and verdicts are expected within the next fortnight. A fifth accused, the alleged ring-leader, killed himself in his jail cell in March. The defendant could only receive a maximum sentence of three years because he was 17 at the time of the attack . The teenager, who may not be named, was tried as a juvenile because he was 17 at the time of the attack. The maximum penalty that could be imposed by India's Juvenile Justice Board was three years. In January, authorities ruled he was 17, citing school records, which shocked the victim's family and others clamouring for him to face the death penalty. In response to the public outcry after the rape, the government fast-tracked tougher laws against sex crimes, but it resisted calls to change the juvenile law and return the adult age to 16 from 18. India's Supreme Court is currently hearing a petition filed by Subramanian Swamy, an opposition politician and lawyer, that calls for the law to be reinterpreted rather than changed. Swamy wants the 'emotional, intellectual and mental maturity' of juvenile offenders to be assessed when deciding whether to try them as a juvenile, rather than basing the decision on age alone. 'I felt that, with the kind of rape that took place, if (the juvenile suspect) got off lightly it would send a bad signal to society,' Swamy said. He plans to launch an appeal against the verdict reached today if the Supreme Court rules in favour of his petition later this year. The teenager pleaded not guilty to all 13 charges including rape, murder and robbery. His trial was held behind closed doors to protect his identity and media were barred from reporting on any details of the proceedings. During his trial, he has been held at a juvenile detention facility for violent young offenders in Delhi and kept away from other inmates for his safety. The youth left home when he was 11 and got work in a roadside eatery, his mother said in January. In recent years he lived as a semi-vagrant, washing buses and collecting fares, according to a police report. After leaving home, he never returned and his mother said she thought he was dead until police arrested him in connection with the gang-rape. Some 33,000 crimes were committed by juveniles in India last year, the highest number in a decade, but there has not been a large spike, according to Home Ministry figures. Juveniles commit a tiny proportion of total crimes in India and far less than other nations such as the United States.","Defendant, 17, given maximum sentence possible under Indian law .

The mother-of-four has mastered technology that allows her to paint pictured using the signals that come from her brain.. Happy: Heide Pfützner has been using technology that reads her brainwaves to create artworks on a computer . Abstract: Heide is given the opportunity to create colourful paintings with the new technology . Her thoughts control the colours, shapes . and brushes she uses as the computer translates the tiny impulses to . form pictures, reports the Sunday Telegraph . Now, the artist is set to exhibit her work in Easdale, near Oban in Scotland. Ms Pfützner, who has Lou Gehrig’s disease in 2007, said: ‘I had never been fond of technical equipment, and despised working with a computer. ‘Brain-computer interface is a breakthrough technology that enables me with my thoughts to create art.

Technology: The system was developed after scientists were studying how to allow people to use social media . Creating shapes: Heide uses the computer screen to create her art. She now sells it online . Electrodes are embedded in a cap that the user wears, and detects what options they want to choose. In future, the electrodes would be implanted into the cortex of the brain to increase the effectiveness of the process. The technology could also be used to give people who are paralyzed the opportunity to communicate. It detects changes in brainwave patterns, showing what the user wants to do. But researchers are now looking to plant a device into the brain to allow computers to connect with the user directly. Technology: Heide is fitted with the cap as begins her drawings .

A British teenager badly burned in an acid attack in Zanzibar has vowed to return to the country to resume her voluntary work - and help find her attackers. Kirstie Trup, 18, had a skin graft last month, just days after she and her friend Katie Gee, also 18, were splashed with battery acid on the Indian Ocean island off Africa. They were left with burns on their faces, chests and hands. Despite her ordeal, Kirstie cherished her time helping underprivileged children and wants to carry on the voluntary work next year. She said: 'This experience, as horrible as it has been, has not deterred me from wanting to do more voluntary work in Zanzibar. In fact I would even like to return to do more work there next year. 'I am very determined to overcome my injuries and aid the investigation as much as possible.' Miss Trup, from North London, is frustrated her assailants have not been caught after she gave police a detailed description of the attack in Stone own, the old part of Zanzibar City. She told the Sunday Times: 'It doesn't make sense that our attackers haven't been caught. Stone Town is a small place and everyone knows everyone.' She suffered severe burns to her shoulder and back after the sulphuric acid was thrown at her by one of two men on a moped as she and Katie walked home from a restaurant. Three locals helped Miss Trup into the sea to help stop the burning, but she had to have a skin graft  on August 15 at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after being flown home.

Violent: 32-year-old Emma Griffiths screamed and tried to bite the police officers who came to her rescue after she crashed her car . A drunken mother who launched an attack on police officers trying to rescue her from a horror smash has been jailed for six months. Beautician Emma Griffiths was already serving a three-year ban for drink-driving when she sped off after realising she had been spotted by a police car driving erratically. But the mother of two did not get very far in her bid to escape with her car clipping a kerb and careering through the air smashing into a phone box moments later. Fearing the worst, officers rushed to help her but the 32-year-old had managed to climb out of the wreckage through the driver’s window leaving another woman trapped inside. But instead of going to her friend’s aid she began ‘screaming and shouting’ launching a vicious attack on the officers who ran over to help the pair. Griffiths attacked and threatened the officers with a metal bar and even tried to bite one of them on the backside. Prosecutor Kerry Bell said that while officers were trying to rescue Griffiths, she had to be taken to the ground screaming and shouting incoherently. During a struggle Griffiths picked up a metal bar - part of the demolished phone box - and waved it about. Mrs Bell said: ‘Later she managed to slip out of one of her handcuffs and attempted to bite an officer on the bottom and scratched his colleague on both wrists.’ Griffiths’ drunken confrontation took place as her smashed car lay on its side smouldering and leaking fluids with a 24-year-old passenger still trapped inside. District Judge Duncan Birrell said: ‘It’s nothing short of miraculous that you and your passenger were not killed. In my estimation you were driving at high speed and incapable of controlling the car.’ Wreckage: Ms Griffiths had sped off from police before clipping a kerb and smashing into a phone box. She attacked police while her passenger was stuck in the car and her car was smouldering . Jailing her for six months at Manchester Magistrates court, he added: ‘The way you treated the police trying to help you was disgraceful and I would be failing in my public duty if I didn’t send you to prison.’ Griffiths had driven off at high speed in her black Citroen after spotting police in the early hours of June 19. During the chase the car somersaulted through a garden fence and ended up on its side in the driveway of a house in Openshaw, Greater Manchester. Griffiths, of West Bank, Openshaw, admitted charges of driving one-and-a-half times over the limit, police assault, careless driving, driving while banned and no insurance. Record: Manchester Magistrates Court heard that Ms Griffiths was serving a three-year ban for drink driving when the crash happened . Disqualifying her for five years, Judge Birrell said: ‘You need to address whatever problems you have - you were very dangerous that night.’ The passenger was freed and treated by paramedics and both were taken to hospital for check-ups. Phillip Reed, defending, said Griffiths who had a significant history of failing to comply with court orders, only had a limited recollection of what happened. He said: ‘She is remorseful but I would be wasting my breath and the court’s time if I tried to argue against a custodial sentence.’","Emma Griffiths, 32 was serving a three-year ban for drink driving when crash happened .

A professor of physics who oversaw one of the world's longest and most painstaking experiments has died without ever seeing it in action. John Mainstone, former head of the department of physics at the University of Queensland, was custodian of the Pitch Drop Experiment for 52 years. The experiment began in 1927 by Thomas Parnell was designed to show that pitch, although it feels solid, will act like a fluid and flows through a glass funnel over time. Scroll down for video... John Mainstone (pictured), former head of the department of physics at the University of Queensland, was custodian of the Pitch Drop Experiment for 52 years. Only eight drops have fallen in the 83 years since the pitch began dripping, and no-one has ever seen one fall . Three years after the experiment began, the glass funnel holding the pitch was cut to allow it to 'flow'. Only eight drops have fallen in the 83 years since the pitch began dripping, and no-one has ever seen one fall. Earlier this year Professor Mainstone, who died last week aged 78 following a stroke, said he expected the next drop would fall by the end of this year. 'It's got a mind of its own and in blink of an eye it can drop,' Professor Mainstone, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 'John's death is particularly sad as in his time as the custodian of the experiment, he did not see a single drop fall,' said Professor Rubinsztein-Dunlop. The experiment is now under constant surveillance, with three webcams trained on it to capture the ninth drop's fall on camera. It can be viewed here. At room temperatures pitch, pictured, appears to be a brittle solid - but the series of 'drops' which have formed in the Australian experiment prove that it is in fact a liquid . Last month, the researchers at at Trinity College Dublin captured the fall of a drop of tar pitch on camera for the first time ever. Drops take between seven and 13 years to fall and this is the first time a drop has been recorded on camera - a similar experiment in Australia missed filming its latest drop in 2000 because the camera was turned off. VIDEO: See the historic pitch drop fall . Pitch is the name for any 'viscoelastic, solid polymer'. It can be made from petrol and is also known as tar, bitumen or asphalt. Pitch can also be produced in plants, known as resin and it is used to waterproof sails and ships. Physicists from Trinity College claimed the viscosity of the pitch in its experiment is around 2 . million times more viscous than honey, or 20 billion times the . viscosity of water. How quickly the tar drops depends on the exact composition of the pitch, and the environment its in. It can be directly affected by temperature and vibrations. Scientists used to think glass was a slow-moving liquid, because old church window panes are thicker at the bottom, but this . is now considered a solid. Pitch-drop experiments involve heating a sample of solid pitch to increase the material's viscosity - ability to flow. It is then poured into a sealed glass funnel. The tar is left to settle before the stem of the funnel is removed to create a hole for the pitch to drop from. The Dublin experiment is believed to be the second oldest pitch-form test. However, the origins of the Dublin experiment are less known than the Parnell test. According to the journal Nature, it is believed to have been started by a professor at the Irish university, Ernest Walton, in 1944 to promote how science experiments can be used for education purposes. No-one was watching the drop and it's believed many fell without being recorded. Physicists . at the college set up a webcam last April to start monitoring the . experiment again and at around 5pm on 11 July the first drop was filmed . falling.

The Australian experiment has been much more widely documented and is in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the world's longest running scientific experiment. It is also believed to have enough pitch in the funnel to last for another hundred years. Professor Mainstone was custodian of the experiment that is on public display . at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.

Indeed, Professor Mainstone was surprised to receive emails from the Inuit people who were watching the experiment online. As more drops fall the gaps between them will grow, so the next drop could be the last one for decades. Recalling a conversation with Thomas Parnell's son, Professor Mainstone once said: ‘Other people in the physics department didn't take much interest in it. The students probably laughed at him. ‘It became something of a real oddity . and was hidden away in a cupboard and when I started I had to convict . the department to put it on display. There were people who thought it . should just be thrown out. Professor Thomas Parnell (1881-1948), conceived the now famous Australian Pitch Drop Experiment . Parnell as a Lieutenant in the AIF, serving in France during the latter part of WWI and into 1919 . The earlier drops that fell during the Australian experiment have now flattened . ‘Before he died in 1948, Parnell would have been there for two drops, so I've been there for many more than him. But no one has ever actually watched one fall. ‘The last time it happened I was in London and I got an email saying it was getting close, but I wasn't worried because we had a camera on it. ‘Then I got an email to say it had happened, which was followed by another email to say the camera had not worked. Hopefully the technology is better now. ‘The closest I have been to seeing a drop live is five minutes away, and on another occasion I left the university thinking it would not drop at least until the next day, but when when I arrived in the morning it had happened. ‘It is very difficult to judge when it is going to drop. But as it gets nearer the pitch hangs by filaments and when one of those breaks it goes. ‘Pitch is not a homogeneous substance and is a complex mix of hydrocarbons so it is difficult to predict what will happen, especially as the conditions have changed with the introduction of air conditioning. ‘People from around the world get in touch about it - and not just from English speaking countries. ‘I've even had emails from Inuit people. There really are pitch drop devotees. ‘Former students come back to the university with their children and grandchildren and look at the experiment and say it looks exactly the same.' He added: ‘I hope it continues to run after I'm gone, I think there are another 100 years left and the gaps between drops will get longer and longer.’","The experiment began in 1924 in a bid to prove pitch, or tar, is a liquid .

Meyer is alleged to have fondled two female passengers. When refused service from flight attendants because he was 'visibly drunk,' Meyer broke out his own bottle of vodka, according to an announcement from the US Attorney’s office in Denver. Not so lucky: Gregory Meyer's luck appears to have run out after his flight was diverted and he was arrested . The flight, from Burbank Bob Hope Airport to John F Kennedy International Airport in New York, was diverted to Denver when pilots decided to eject him after flight attendants complained of his ‘assaultive behaviour.’ The last entry on Meyer's Facebook page was him checking in to Bob Hope Airport saying 'Here we go.' Smelling of alcohol when he boarded the flight, Meyer is alleged to have stroked a female passenger’s arm, grabbed her waist and tried to grab her hand. The startled woman was sitting next to the purported pervert, but across the aisle. Rebuffed by the first object of his drunken desire, Meyer then allegedly grabbed the head of a female passenger seated in front of him. Meyer then supposedly refused to follow the requests of flight attendants, causing the pilot to land the plane. Here we go!: Meyer was already loaded when he boarded the flight . He might want to cut back: Meyer, seen enjoying another one, might want cut back on his drinking in the future . During further questioning, investigators discovered that Meyer had also taken an Ambien sleeping pill, it is not clear if he had a prescription for the medication. Meyer was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, placed into federal custody and arraigned Friday on two charges of simple assault, each charge carries a maximum 6-month prison sentence and a $5,000 fine. It is not known if Meyer, originally from New York, continued on with his trip or returned home to California.

Three British soldiers were killed by a massive bomb in Afghanistan that the Taliban spent three weeks planting below a road, it emerged today. Terrorists dug a tunnel under a key route through Helmand Province and then pulled a wire to detonate the 450lb weapon with devastating results as an Army vehicle passed over it last April. The bomb killed Corporal William Savage, 30, Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, the first troops to die travelling in the Army’s heavily-armoured 23-ton Mastiff vehicles. Six other soldiers were injured by the Taliban attack. Scroll down for video . Victims: Corporal William Thomas Savage, left, and Fusiler Samuel Flint right, both served in the Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment Of Scotland (2 Scots), and were killed by a 450lb bomb in April . Mastiff personnel carriers had . withstood hundreds of attacks since they were brought in specifically to . combat the threat from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in 2007. Tragedy: The Taliban also took the life of Private Robert Murray Hetherington, from the 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment Of Scotland (7 Scots) Military sources said at the time that the blast did not appear to have penetrated the £1million Mastiff’s armour. Instead, the casualties were . apparently caused by the vehicle being blown into the air and the force . of the impact when it landed and rolled on to its roof. 'It's an arms race, they build bigger bombs, we build better vehicles and so on. Bit there can always be a bigger bomb,' a military source told The Sun today. Cpl Savage – nicknamed Sav – who . was born in Irvine, Scotland, was described as a ‘shining example of a . soldier and a rising star’. His wife Lyndsey said: ‘I am completely devastated but extremely proud of . Sav. I have lost the love of my life.’ Fusilier Flint, from Blackpool, was . described as a ‘vastly impressive soldier’. His family said they were . ‘completely devastated’. Pte Hetherington had represented . Scotland at lacrosse and was said to have ‘epitomised everything that is . excellent about the reserve forces’. The men and their six comrades were on . a routine patrol in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province when . they were attacked. Their deaths took the number of British soldiers . killed in Afghanistan to 444. Targeted: Three British soldiers were killed in Afghanistan when their Mastiff armoured vehicle which was introduced to protect troops was devastated by a huge roadside bomb (file picture) At the time David Cameron confirmed he wanted defence chiefs to look into whether the right equipment was being used to cope with such attacks. He said: ‘We have done an enormous . amount to improve the quality and quantity of protective vehicles that . our soldiers use out in Afghanistan and, as I understand, it had a . pretty good record of withstanding blasts from IEDs. 'I’m sure we’ll want . to look at that carefully and put in place everything we can to make . sure that our brave men and women have the best protective equipment . they have. ‘The troops have said to me they were . pretty satisfied with what they had, but we must always look at this.’ The Prime Minister added that the UK had paid a ‘very high price’ for . the work to stabilise Afghanistan. Scene: The soldiers were on a routine patrol in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand Province . General Lord Dannatt, the former head . of the Army, said: ‘The Taliban have found a way of countering the . protective qualities of the Mastiff. It would seem that this was an . extremely large bomb that was so powerful it was able to cause . fatalities within the vehicle itself.’ The attack came three days after the . Taliban launched its ‘spring offensive’ against coalition forces. The . Taliban said they would infiltrate ‘enemy ranks’ to conduct ‘insider . attacks’ and target military and diplomatic sites with suicide bombers. The IED, which may have been dug into . the tarred road surface when it softened during the winter, could have . been detonated remotely. The Mastiff carries electronic counter-measures . to jam remote-controlled IEDs, and investigators will check for links . between the massive blast and Iran which is suspected of providing the .

So consumed was the Glaswegian TV star by her career, she missed out on precious moments with daughter Rosie and says that at times she was 'desperate' to be with her. 'I did suffer terribly from ""working mother guilt"" especially when Rosie was little,' the mother-of-one told Woman & Home magazine. Lorraine has revealed she felt terrible about leaving her daughter at home while she worked . 'I remember sitting on delayed trains, desperate to be back at home with her. Although I've always turned up for work and never asked for time off. 'The only time I did was when Rosie was two and a half and playing Mary in the school nativity. My radio bosses at the time said I couldn't go but I took it off anyway and have never regretted it.' Although she was able to take the occasional day off, Lorraine spent most of Rosie's early years establishing a hugely successful TV career, that has included stints on TV-am, GMTV, ITV Breakfast and Daybreak. At the same time, Lorraine was also dealing with the aftermath of a devastating miscarriage that saw her rushed to hospital, dangerously ill, when Rosie was just five years old. As a result, she and Rosie, who is now 19 and appears with her mother in the October issue of Woman & Home, share an extraordinarily close bond.

'My mum's no domestic goddess – she can't even cook an egg,' she reveals. 'But she is wonderful at cheering me up and being bonkers in the nicest possible way!' 'Her most annoying habit is she . dances around the kitchen with her hips swaying, singing away, not . knowing the correct song lyrics. I have to leave the room!' Despite her lack of cooking and singing skills, Lorraine's dedication to giving Rosie a happy, stable childhood has manifested in other ways, including avoiding red carpet events in order to make sure her daughter's life remained stable. 'I want to give Rosie as ""normal"" an upbringing as possible, so try to avoid red carpet events and star studded parties,' says Lorraine. 'When she was growing up I was just 'Rosie's Mum'. No one took a second glance at the school gates and that's how it should be.'

The chilling moment a German lorry driver ploughed his 40-ton vehicle into the back of a queue of motorway traffic and killed a man has been released on CCTV. Anton Maizen was jailed for four-and-a-half years this week after he caused the death of a 79-year-old man and injured two others. He had been driving solidly for 15 hours before the crash, which happened on the M25 near Aveley in Essex. Footage of the violent crash shows Maizen, 58, hurtling towards the back of the sliproad queue at 56mph - the maximum speed his lorry would allow. Scroll down for video . Moment from impact: Anton Maizen's 40-ton lorry approaches the queue of traffic on the sliproad of the M25 in Essex at full pelt . Smash: Unable to stop, he ploughs into the back of a BMW at 56mph, the lorry's maximum speed . Unfolding horror: The smashed BMW is propelled into the inside lane, causing a second lorry to lose control and swerve into the queue of traffic . Swerve: The second lorry comes off the road, while the German's vehicle jackknifes and ends up on the hard shoulder . He smashes into the back of one car, which causes a second lorry to swerve off the inside lane and into the queue, while Maizen's vehicle careers into a wall. Jailed: Maizen was jailed for four-and-a-half years earlier this week . A mother and child escaped without serious injury but the driver of a Renault Clio, 79-year-old Ronald Moughton from Ilford, died at the scene. Maizen, of Wixhausen, south of Frankfurt, admitted one count of causing death by dangerous driving and two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Basildon Crown Court today. The crash, on Tuesday, April 2, came after Maizen had been at work for nearly 23 hours - driving for 15 of those hours without a break. Maizen's 840-mile journey had begun the . previous day in Germany, with the driver entering the UK via Folkestone. He then drove to south London, before continuing on his way to . Lincolnshire. During this time he did not take breaks of longer than an hour - and did not have any sustained period of sleep, the court heard. Maizen was returning to the Channel Tunnel when the crash took . place. During his police interviews, he was unable to explain why he struck the rear of the queue at his maximum speed of 56mph. Maizen's . tachograph charts were found hidden behind the driver's seat and a data . chart in his sock was later found disclosing his route and timings. Wreckage: A man died as a result of the pile up on the M25 in Essex . Dangerous: The crash came after Maizen had been at work for nearly 23 hours - with 15 of them spent on the road . The German motorist was disqualified . from driving for five years and ordered to take an extended driving test . in order to regain his licence. Tailbacks: The German was also disqualified from driving for five years following the collision . Judge Owen Davies QC said: 'It would . appear that you failed to slow your vehicle and were still driving at . 50mph when you applied the brakes. 'Expert evidence shows it must have been fatigue that caused this incident. 'You had been driving for 22 hours and 44 minutes without the lengthy period of rest required. 'Your actions in those brief moments have caused untold misery on others.' James . Harrison, mitigating, told the court his client deeply regretted his . actions and took complete responsibility for the suffering he has . caused. He said: 'He knows that words are not . enough to express the regret he feels for those who suffered loss and . injury as a result of his actions. 'Had he foreseen the likelihood of any incident like this unfolding he would never have climbed behind the wheel of his cab.' Inspector Keith Whiting of Essex .

'We . also believe that people who were disrupted for several hours as a . result of this crash will appreciate that the complex and meticulous . investigation undertaken by Essex Police's Serious Collision .

A terminally ill bank manager with brain cancer has made her last wishes clear – she wants to die. Grace Sung Eun Lee even managed to vocalise her wishes, telling her parents and the doctors tending to her: ‘I want to die.’ But because the 28-year-old’s parents are deeply religious and belong to a Korean Christian church in Queens, they believe that allowing her daughter to choose death over life is a sin. The rift in beliefs has led to an agonising legal battle for the family. Bitter battle: Grace Sung Eun Lee, centre, is on breathing tubes following a seizure from a brain tumour, but her parents will not allow her to be removed from the tubes . Happier times: Grace, centre, pictured with her parents Manho Lee, left, and Jin-ah Lee, right; her father is a pastor at a Flushing, Queens church . Speaking with the New York Daily News, Ms Lee’s mother, Jin-ah Lee, said: ‘Despite all this confusion, (my daughter) wants to go to heaven. I keep telling her she can get better.’ Her daughter is currently at Long Island North Shore Hospital, hooked up to breathing tubes that are keeping her alive. She is paralysed from the neck down due to the tumour on her brain stem. Ms Lee’s father is Antioch Missionary Church reverend Manho Lee, and practices out of his church in the Flushing neighbourhood of Queens. His congregation has flocked behind him to pray for Ms Lee and tell her of God's plans for her life. The sin of suicide, they said, would condemn their daughter's soul to hell. The difference in beliefs has led to an emergency end-of-life hearing at the hospital, with the two sides bitterly re-affirming their respective stances. Smiling: Ms Lee had worked as a manager at Bank of America and lived in Manhattan . Meeting: On October 1, there was a press conference at North Shore Hospital to inform the media of Grace's condition . Speaking on behalf of Ms Lee, Dr Dana Lustbader testified that the patient ‘consistently asks that her breathing tube be removed.’ However, Rev Lee and his wife argued that their daughter is heavily medicated, and is not lucid enough to make the life-or-death decision. End-of-life issues are ones that are at once vastly personal and highly polarised. According to the American College of Physicians, the important thing is to do what the person said they wanted, rather than what the person forced to make a decision. In cases where the patient cannot speak for themselves and there are no specific end-of-life wishes, the ACP suggests: ‘You can make a decision if you can determine what the person probably would have chosen,’ known as a ‘substituted judgment.’ Doctors said that her medications, including morphine and an anti-anxiety medication, are not strong enough to cloud her judgment. Ms Lee’s troubles began last year. Before her illness, she worked as a manager for Bank of America, living and working in Manhattan. She was also training for the famous New York City marathon. She had emigrated with her parents from Seoul, South Korea, the Daily News reported. But Ms Lee was devastated when she was diagnosed with a tumour in her brain stem. Though she received chemotherapy and radiation, the treatments did not successfully target the tumour, and last month, she had a seizure that eventually left her paralysed. Ms Lee had apparently talked to nurses at North Shore about removing the tubes, but her parents interceded. Offering support: Members of the congregation in Ms Lee's room, praying for her to be healed . A Facebook page entitled Save Grace SungEun Lee cites a passage from the Old Testament, which reads: ‘”For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord. “Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”’ A post from Tuesday reads: ‘We can see God’s powers working every day and know that God has a plan for her too!’ Children from the congregation have written notes of encouragement for the 28-year-old, with one writing: ‘I hope you feel better. I miss you, Grace Teacher.’ Cultural, as well as religious differences have come to play in Ms Lee’s case. Rev Young Gab Hyun said: ‘In Korean culture…we believe that the decisions that the parents make have a lot more influence in this type of matter.’ Words of love: Young members of the church offered kind words to Ms Lee, calling her 'Grace Teacher,' and pleading with her to come back soon . ‘The role of religion in medial decision making really pertains to the patient,’ Tia Powell, M.D., the director of Montefiore Einstein Center for Bioethics, told MailOnline. ‘If the patient is capable of making her decisions, then that’s where we would honour.’ Dr Powell added that while it may be heart-wrenching for the parents to face, she said the goal of bioethics is to bring the families together. ‘The question is not whether she’s going to die, it’s how she’s going to die. ‘There’s nothing worse than losing a child,’ she said, ‘but there are limits to medical treatment. There are many things we cannot fix, we cannot perform miracles.’ Dr Powell said that there are some practices that could help Ms Lee’s parents come to terms with their daughter’s illness. ‘These are religious people, and they know we are all mortal,’ she said. ‘Being clear about that can maybe help decrease their suffering.’","Grace Sung Eun Lee, 28, is paralysed from neck down after brain tumour led to seizure .

The widow of a man who was murdered outside a preschool by her mentally-ill lover appeared in court yesterday, accused of lying under oath about their affair. Andrea Sneiderman, from Atlanta, was initially accused of arranging her husband Rusty Sneiderman's killing but murder charges were later dropped. Her lover Hemy Neuman was convicted after telling police an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it. Yesterday, Sneiderman's defense attorneys painted her out as a happily married mother devastated by her husband's death, not the woman prosecutors described as engaged in a 'forbidden romance' with her boss. The contrasting portraits of Sneiderman emerged during opening statements in her trial on charges of lying under oath and hindering the investigation into her husband's death. Tears: Andrea Sneiderman becomes emotional as she listens to defense attorney Tom Clegg's opening arguments at her trial on Monday, August 5, 2013 . Defense atorney Tom Clegg: Sneiderman is accused of lying under oath and hindering the investigation into her husband's death . Torn apart: Russell Sneiderman was murdered after dropping his children off at daycare . DeKalb County prosecutor Kellie Hill told the jury: 'The evidence will show a forbidden . romance that ends in murder, silence despite her suspicion, and lies to . conceal the truth from her family, from her friends, from the police and . from a jury.' Sneiderman's husband, 36-year-old Rusty Sneiderman, was fatally shot in November 2010 outside a suburban Atlanta preschool while he was dropping his son off. Neuman was convicted of the killing in March 2012, but he was found to be mentally ill. He told mental health examiners . he was visited by a demon whose voice sounded like Barry White and an . angel who looked like Olivia Newton-John. The angel ordered him to . fatally shoot Sneiderman, Neuman said in one interview. 37-year-old Sneiderman has pleaded not guilty and has repeatedly denied any romantic relationship with Neuman. DeKalb County prosecutor Kellie Hill told the jury that evidence in the case will show that soon after Sneiderman took a job at General Electric, she formed a friendship with Neuman that quickly blossomed into a romantic relationship. But because she was married with young children, she felt conflicted about it and was hot and cold with Neuman, Hill said. Emails the state plans to present show 'she feels torn between her reality and her desires,' Hill said. Andrea Sneiderman had willingly participated in a relationship with Neuman, sharing deep personal secrets with him, sending him photos of her children, and sharing kisses and other physical contact with him during business trips, Hill said. But she failed to tell police about her relationship with Neuman and failed to tell them she suspected he might be involved, Hill said. 'If the police had known about the relationship, they would have known why someone wanted Rusty dead,' she said. Accused: Andrea Sneiderman smiles as the jury comes into the Dekalb County Superior Court before opening statements were given by attorneys . Lovers turned fighters: Andrea Sneiderman (left) was having an affair with her then-boss Hemy Neuman (right) when he shot and killed her husband Rusty . Bereaved: Don and Marilyn Sneiderman, parents of murder victim Rusty Sneiderman, listen to opening arguments at the trial of Andrea Sneiderman . Sneiderman also lied under oath . during Neuman's trial last year, denying the romantic relationship and . lying about when she found out her husband had been shot, Hill said. As . she was driving to the preschool after getting a call from an employee . there about an emergency, she called her father-in-law and told him his . son had been shot, even though no one had told her that yet, Hill said. Defense . attorney Tom Clegg told jurors that Sneiderman told police the day . after her husband's killing that Neuman had tried to break up her . family. She was happily . married, brushed aside advances from Neuman at work and never . complained to human resources because she didn't want to create problems . for herself and couldn't imagine he would do harm, Clegg said. 'The . bottom line is Hemy Neuman was a pest, Hemy Neuman was a nuisance. Hemy . Neuman, to this woman, was not a threat,' Clegg said. Sneiderman cooperated with police and suggested Neuman might have been involved, Clegg said. She . was so broken up over her husband's death that, on what would have been . their 10th wedding anniversary, she put on her wedding dress and went . to the synagogue in Florida where they got married, hoping to feel his . spirit, Clegg said. The . state called several witnesses on Monday, including a waitress who said . she served drinks to Neuman and Andrea Sneiderman in Greenville, South . Carolina, in October 2010, and a hotel front desk clerk from Longmont, . Colorado. Cuffed: Andrea Sneiderman, 37, is on trial for charges including lying under oath, perjury and hindering the investigation into the murder of her husband, Rusty Sneiderman . Sorrow: Don Sneiderman, left, reacts after the reading of the verdict of the Hemy Neuman trial in the DeKalb County Courthouse on March 15, 2012, in Decatur, Georgia . The state also showed several video clips of Andrea Sneiderman's testimony from Neuman's trial. In one video clip, Sneiderman is shown talking about a business trip she and Neuman took to Greenville, South Carolina. She . testified they had dinner and then went to a bar. They had one or two . drinks, she got up and danced alone and then he joined her on the dance . floor and twirled her, she testified. They had no contact other than partner dancing, she said. The . state called Christine Olivera, a bartender who was working that night. Sneiderman seemed upset when they arrived and took her cellphone with . her to the bathroom, Olivera said. When . she came back to the bar, she had sipped her drink and seemed to cheer . up, Olivera said. Neuman led Sneiderman onto the dance floor and after a . short while, Sneiderman danced flirtatiously, as if she were seducing . Neuman, Olivera said. Unusual urgings: During his trial, Neuman said that an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it, as did a demon who sounded like Barry White . The . two kissed more than once and eventually left the bar in each other's . arms, pausing to kiss on the sidewalk, Olivera testified. In a video clip from Neuman's trial, . Sneiderman is seen testifying that Neuman was in Longmont, Colorado, at . the same time she was there for work in July 2010 and that she believed . he was there for work. But in an email exchange from that time that she . reads aloud, Neuman tells her he was not there for business. When a lawyer asks her about that, she says she supposes he was there to see her, maybe to stalk her. The state called Brady Blackburn, a front desk clerk from the hotel where Sneiderman stayed in Colorado. In . an employee log from the hotel, there is a message from another clerk . saying Neuman called and instructing Blackburn to read a short love note . to Andrea Sneiderman. Blackburn . also testified that hotel records showed that he checked Sneiderman . into her room and that her booking was modified from one guest to two. Sneiderman was arrested at a home in . Putnam County lat last year and was being held without bond.

Officials said the epicentre was in the Irish Sea, just 10 miles off the coast from the town of Abersoch, Gwynedd. The quake, which struck at 4.15am, was . felt over a 90 mile radius in areas as far apart as Southport, in . Merseyside, Dublin, in Ireland, and Douglas, Isle of Man. Although thousands of people are thought to have been woken up by the rumbling this morning, it is not thought to have caused any significant damage. Earthquake: The quake was felt at 4.16am today (3.16am in coordinated universal time) just off the coast of north Wales . The biggest earthquake ever recorded in Britain with a magnitude of 5.4 stuck in the same area in the Llyn Peninsula in 1984. That was 250 times as big and caused chimney stacks to topple, the British Geological Survey (BGS) said. Today an aftershock with a magnitude of 1.7 was measured four minutes later at 4.20am but it was so small that only one person has so far reported feeling it. David Galloway, a seismologist with the BGS, said today: 'We have had 193 reports from people who felt the earthquake already but that number is going up all the time. 'A couple of those reports are from Dublin, some from Douglas on the Isle of Man, and some in Southport. 'We don't expect a quake of this size to cause any damage. A few people might say there were cracks to plaster but there won't be any structural damage. 'With the quake in 1984 there were reports of chimneys coming off rooftops but that earthquake was 250 times as big with a magnitude of 5.4. 'To put it in context, the earthquake which hit Japan in March 2011 with a magnitude of 9.0 was 67million times as big.' Quake: The ground shook in the Llyn Peninsula at around 4.15am today. The epicentre was in the Irish Sea, around 10 miles off the coast . A report by the BGS said that people reported 'gradually grew louder. Classic underground train passing sensation' and 'woke the household any many neighbours'. Mother Eirian Rees, 48, said: 'The earthquake woke me up in the night from a deep sleep. 'The house was shaking - I thought my two boys were running around wildly as the floor was shaking and rumbling. 'It was also very noisy and unreal, my heart was beating and it felt like it lasted quite a long time.' Peter McShane, of Menai Bridge, Isle of Anglesey, told the BBC: 'I woke up, I don't why looked at the clock it was 4.15am and suddenly the rumbling started. 'The one in 1984 was considerably more intense in that I remember in the house in the afternoon when one of them sort of started it sort of blurred your vision and things fell off your bookcase. 'This one was nothing alarming.' The Irish National Seismic Network said tremors were felt in counties in south-east Ireland and its seismic stations in Valentia off the south-west coast, Donegal and Galway all recorded the earthquake. Tom Blake, INSN director and from the school of cosmic physics in the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, said there has been a significant increase in seismic activity in the area in recent months. 'It is unlikely that the magnitude of today’s earthquake will be exceeded in the Irish Sea in the coming days but aftershocks can be expected in the hours and days ahead, although many will be too weak to be felt,' he said. There was a far smaller earthquake in Caernarfon Bay, Gwynedd, on February 7 this year, which had a magnitude of 2.3.

British stylist Gok Wan has taught women all over the world how to look good naked, but has now found himself in hot water down under by trying to get ladies to cover up. Appearing in an Australian TV commercial for bras from clothing giant Target, the bespectacled fashion guru generated viewer complaints to the Advertising Standards Bureau for referring to breasts as 'bangers' and 'assets', which some people found 'offensive' and 'degrading'. Despite complaints, however, the ASB decided there was no breach of code, commenting that the advert's overall tone was 'positive and lighthearted' and . intended to draw attention to the importance of . buying the correct bra size, according to Karen Collier of the Herald Sun. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Gok Wan is, despite being gay, no stranger to the female breast, thanks to his television show in which he teaches women how to look good naked . On the advert, Wan appears dancing through the Target store with several topless women, saying: 'Hi, I'm Gok Wan at Target, and I'm all about your assets, but 85 per cent of you do not know your true bra size... but we've got bra fitters in every store, so there's no excuse: your bangers will never feel more loved.' Critics complained the advert was demeaning and compared women to meat, while others were disappointed that the campaign featured a gay man. One said : 'I have never called, or even heard another woman, or man for . that matter, refer to women's breasts as bangers, bangers are a slang . term for a sausage, I do not want my breast referred to as meat.' But Target said the 'playful' ad stood parallel with brand values: 'It . contains words used in common parlance, such as 'assets' to encourage . women to think about themselves in positive terms. 'The . term 'bangers' is used in wry acceptance that not everyone thinks about . their breasts in positive terms. It is an irreverent term of . affection.' Speaking about their choice of star for the campaign, they commented on Wan: 'He feels good about who he is as he is. He is playfully irreverent, . colourful and fun. He has a great capacity for making other people feel . good about themselves too. 'Target . strongly believes that a person's sexuality is irrelevant to their . worth as a person. Target makes no apology for using a gay man in its . advertising.' Despite complaints about Gok Wan's use of the word 'bangers', the ASB decided there was no breach of code, commenting that the advert's overall tone was 'positive and lighthearted' The ASB said: 'The . board considered the term 'bangers' and recognised that some members of . the community may be offended by the reference to women's breasts as . bangers. 'The . board considered that the word is not commonly used in Australia in this . manner but that in this instance, it is not used in a derogatory way . and that the use of the term bangers is one that is used by Gok as part . of his programs and persona. 'The board considered that the term 'bangers' is not inappropriate and not strong or obscene language in this context.' The term has since been replaced with 'boobs', a more commonplace Australian term for breasts.","Stylist appears on TV ad saying 'your bangers will never feel more loved'

The Kennel Club  has discovered that half of the dogs show behavioural problems, while more than one in ten have serious health issues. They are warning would-be owners to avoid retailers who use websites and social media as a front for cruel puppy farms. Welfare organisations say such breeders are interested only in profits, rather than the animals’ well-being. Warning: Almost one in five puppies bought online die within the first six months, according to the Kennel Club . Welfare organisations claim such breeders are only interested in profits, not the animals’ health or well-being. As a consequence, many die due to poor health while still puppies or require expensive veterinary treatment. They are also more likely to display aggressive or unsociable behaviour. Experts warn that any prospective owner should ideally buy their pet from a registered breeder or a rescue centre, and visit the premises to see the puppy with its mother and inspect health certificates. Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary, said: ‘More and more people are buying puppies from sources, such as the internet, which are often used by puppy farmers. 'Whilst there is nothing wrong with initially finding a puppy online, it is essential to then see the breeder and ensure that they are doing all of the right things. ‘This research clearly shows that too many people are failing to do this, and the consequences can be seen in the shocking number of puppies that are becoming sick or dying. 'We have an extremely serious consumer protection and puppy welfare crisis on our hands. ‘We urge people to always buy a puppy from a member of the Kennel Club Assured Breeder Scheme, who are the only breeders in the country whose membership is based upon their ability to show that the health and welfare of their pups comes first and foremost.’ Popular: Online breeders have turned their attention to new breeds, such as this Labradoodle . In the survey of more than 2,000 dogs owners, the Kennel Club asked them about their experience of buying a puppy. Currently, one in three owners source their puppy from the internet, social media, pet shops or print advertisements - all outlets that are commonly used by puppy farmers. And of growing concern is that the internet is the second most common way for under-25s to purchase a puppy, with a third admitting they purchased their dog this way. Horrific: TV vet Mark Abraham said the problem could still get worse . The research also found owners of cross and mixed breeds are less likely to see the puppy with the mum and where it was born, with half not seeing the mum and 72 per cent not seeing its home environment. This has led to fears over unscrupulous breeders cashing in on fashionable dogs such as the Labradoodle - a cross between a Labrador and a poodle - and the Puggle - a beagle and pug mix. TV vet Marc Abraham, said: ‘Sadly, if the ""buy it now"" culture persists then this horrific situation will only get worse. 'There is nothing wrong with sourcing a puppy online but people need to be aware of what they should then expect from the breeder. ‘For example, you should not buy a car without getting its service history and seeing it at its registered address, so you certainly shouldn’t buy a puppy without the correct paperwork and health certificates and without seeing where it was bred. ‘However, too many people are opting to buy directly from third parties such as the internet, pet shops, or from puppy dealers, where you cannot possibly know how or where the puppy was raised.’","Kennel Club has warned would-be owners to avoid online retailers .

A man charged with murdering an elderly couple and sexually assaulting their two year old grandchild had been released from prison just hours earlier after serving time for a similar attack. Jerry Active, 24, broke in to the house where Touch Chea, 71, and his wife, Sorn Sreap, 73, were babysitting their granddaughter and allegedly beat the couple to death and raped the little girl. The toddler's parents returned to their home in Anchorage, Alaska,  on Saturday night to find Active naked in their bedroom with the two-year-old. Suspect: Jerry Andrew Active tries to shield his face during his arraignment on charges of murder and sexual assault of a minor in the Anchorage jail court on Sunday . Active was arrested about a block from an apartment where the bodies of Sorn Sreap and Touch Chea were found dead on Saturday night by their granddaughter, who had returned from a trip to a movie with her husband . A few hours earlier Active had been . released on probation after serving part of a seven-year sentence for a similar crime committed in 2009. Active broke into a . house and sexually assaulted an 11-year-old while her parents were . asleep, before attacking three members of the family. The 24-year-old was convicted for the attack . in Dillingham, Alaska, after a guilty plea but it has not been made . clear why Active was allowed on probation. He was first released on the case on . October 2, 2011, but violated probation and was sent back to prison two . days later, according to records. Since then, he has been in and out of prison after committing other probation violations. Registered sex offender: Active spent time in jail in 2010 and 2011 for a similar attack four years ago and was on probation . Victims Mr Chea and Ms Sreap both suffered significant blunt force injuries, and police said both Sreap and the toddler were raped. Officers arrested Active as he fled the east Anchorage homicide scene wearing just his boxer shorts. The registered sex offender has been charged with first and second-degree murder, sexual assault and burglary, with bail set at $1.5 million. Police said the younger couple, who . are in their twenties, went to a movie on Saturday night with their son and left . the two-year-old in the care of Chea and Sreap. They returned shortly before 8pm and found the door locked from the inside by the chain, but were able to spot the body of one of their grandparents from outside. The father told police he forced his way in through a window and found the bodies of Chea and Sreap before  discovering a naked man in the bedroom with their daughter. Scene: The victims were part of an extended family that lived in a ground-floor, east Anchorage apartment with their granddaughter and her husband . The mother called police and dispatchers said they heard screaming over the phone as the woman, who is pregnant, reported that a man had broken into her home and killed 73-year-old Ms Sreap. The couple tried to apprehend Active but he was able to get away after a short struggle, Police Sergeant Slawomir Markiewicz said. Officers found Active about a block away wearing nothing but his boxers. 'He did offer some resistance but he was arrested,' Markiewicz said. The suspect apparently entered the apartment through a window, Markiewicz said. The . two-year-old was taken to hospital for a forensic physical examination, . and it was discovered that she had also been physically assaulted. She was taken to a hospital where she underwent surgery for her injuries. Investigators were affected by the brutality and the ages of the victims, police department spokeswoman Anita Shell said. 'They said this was the worst thing they had ever seen in their lives, and these are seasoned detectives,' Shell said. Accused: The registered sex offender was charged with first and second-degree murder, sexual assault and burglary . Merciless: Active entered the apartment through an open window and locked it from the inside so he could commit the horrific acts . Social media: Active had a number of menacing and ominous pictures on his MySpace account . Police Sergeant Markiewicz said that there are no indications that the victims were connected to the suspect. 'It doesn't appear that he knew them,' he said. 'It looks like a totally random act.' The . victims were part of an extended family that lived in a ground-floor, . east Anchorage apartment with their granddaughter and her husband, who . are the parents of the toddler and her four-year-old brother. The younger couple's 90-year-old great-grandmother also lives in the apartment and was at home during the incident. Markiewicz said the case is unusual. 'It's certainly very rare to see this kind of violence - a complete stranger, sexually assaulting and murdering someone,' he said. The bodies of Sreap and Chea were taken to the state medical examiner's office for autopsies. Names of the toddler and her parents were withheld. The double homicide happened Anchorage, Alaska.

Sarah Watson, 38, thought she had found the love of her life when she met Ghanaian-born Henry Assumang in 2007. But less than two years later their relationship broke down. It would be a further year-and-a-half before she would be given the life-shattering news he was HIV-positive. Scroll down for video... Sarah Watson, 38, thought she had found the love of her life when she met Henry Assumang in 2007. But less than two years later their relationship broke down and she was given the life-shattering news he had HIV . Describing him as a 'gentleman', Ms Watson said that when she initially met Mr Assumang, she hoped he would help look after her family. 'He always made me feel special - he was very complimentary to me and my children,' she said on ITV's This Morning. 'He took an interest in my children and he fitted in well with my family. He was always there to give love and support.' But the romance was short-lived and a year into the relationship the couple started having, as Ms Watson described it, 'trust-issues'. The mother-of-two said: 'He started to go out a lot and would turn him phone off.' Six months later, the couple split, but they stayed on good terms and he still took an active interest in her children. Mr Assumang (pictured) denied he knew he had carried HIV up until he death, earlier this month. He was charged with GBH for passing on the virus but his case didn't go to trial in time . Dr Carole Cooper (left), who also appeared on the programme, said: 'If you think you might be at risk then you must get a test - fortunately it's a lot easier to get tested. 'And if you don't want your GP knowing, you can go to a sexual health clinic where a test won't show up on your medical record' It wasn't until 2010, when police turned up at Ms Watson's door, that she discovered she had contracted the virus. If a person is exposed to the virus, anti-HIV medication may stop a person becoming infected so long as it is take within 72 hours. For it to be effective, the medication, called post-exposure prophylaxis or PEP, must be started within 72 hours of coming into contact with the virus. The quicker PEP is started the better - the longer the wait, the less chance of it being effective. PEP has been misleadingly popularised as a 'morning-after pill' for HIV. PEP is a month-long treatment, which has serious side effects and is not guaranteed to work. The treatment involves taking the same drugs prescribed to people who have tested positive for HIV. A person can gain access to PEP from hospitals, A&E departments, sexual health clinics, or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics. GPs usually do not provide PEP. 'Police turned up at my house and asked me what my sexual history was. 'I didn't answer at first and asked why they needed to know. 'They said they had a man waiting to be deported and needed to clarify his relationship history.' It quickly became apparent that the man in question was Mr Assumang. Before foreign nationals are deported they are tested for the virus and his test had come back positive. The former shop worker was told she needed an urgent test and her results were fast-tracked. The following day it was confirmed she too was HIV-positive. 'It completely turned my world upside,' said Ms Watson. 'I was in shock and couldnt believe it. 'When the viral load test came back it also told me I had just six to nine months to live.' If a person has contracted HIV it is essential treatment be started immediately, or as soon as possible. If it is caught within 72 hours of transmission, a person can even fight off the virus. Ms Watson had however lived with the virus for three years without knowing and needed urgent treatment. Luckily swift intervention after her shock diagnosis has managed to keep her alive. Despite the 'news' that Ms Assumang was carrying the virus, Ms Watson believes that he knew for many years that he was HIV-positive. 'He was receiving treatment for the condition in 2006, a year before we met,' she said. 'He was fully aware [he had HIV].' Mr Assumang denied this up until he death, earlier this month. He was charged with GBH for passing on the virus but his case didn't go to trial in time. Ms Watson is concerned other women may unknowingly have the virus as he went on to have other relationships - and perhaps even one-night stands - after the couple split. It is essential to get early treatment for HIV. A person can visit a sexual health clinic without their GP knowing. Despite the ease with which people can be tested, only a quarter of those infected with HIV (virus pictured) know they have the disease . Dr Carole Cooper, who also appeared on the programme said: 'This story shows that you really can't tell who has HIV without a test. 'If you think you might be at risk then you must get a test - fortunately it's a lot easier to get tested now. 'And if you don't want your GP knowing you can go to a sexual health clinic where a test won't show up on your medical records. 'It's essential to get early treatment - you can go to sexual health clinic without you GP knowing.' 'Despite this, a quarter of those infected with HIV know they have the disease.' Dr Cooper added that it's important to realise that HIV isn't a death sentence in the way it was in previous years. Within the past five years, she said, the 'outlook has revolutionised' as there are many new drugs on offer. 'It is so important to have an early dignosis and it can be hard to put up with the drugs as there are some hefty side-effects,' she explained. 'But they are a patient's passport to a healthy life.' Ms Watson remains worried about her future and said: 'I will find it hard to trust anyone ever again. I live in a very hard situation right now.'","Former shop worker Sarah Watson thought she had found the love of her life when she met Ghanaian-born Henry Assumang in 2007 .

Finish scientists said babies still in their mothers' wombs develop a memory of frequently-heard words . Parents-to-be who talk and sing to their unborn baby might be giving them a head start when it comes to developing their child's language skills. Finnish scientists said babies still in their mothers' wombs develop a memory of frequently-heard words. Minna Huotilainen said a baby is not a blank slate when it enters the world and has already learned how his or her family members speak before being born. She believes the research shows how well a baby's brain adapts to sounds at a very early stage in its life. Professor Huotilainen, of the University of Helsinki, said: 'It is a sign of very early language learning, or adaptation to the sounds they heard.' The research demonstrates that babies remember the sounds they heard in the womb, despite the fact that when they heard them as foetuses, their brains were still developing the connections that allow them to process any thoughts and external sensations, Medical Express reported. There is already evidence to suggest that foetuses can learn and babies can recall songs or passes from books read to them before they were born. In this study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers exposed Finnish unborn babies to one word - 'tatata' - that does not have a meaning but follows the rules of the Finnish language. Professor Huotilainen said the pseudo word was chosen because it has three syllables to make it difficult for babies to detect subtle changes within the word and give them something challenging to learn. There is already evidence to suggest that foetuses can learn and babies can recall songs or passes from books read to them before they were born. Scientists said simply speaking normally (instead of using headphones pictured) exposes an unborn baby to language . A total of 33 women took part in the study in the 29th week of their pregnancy until birth and half of them listened to recordings of the word 'tatata' repeated hundreds of times. However, sometimes the recorded voice pronounced it differently and even mixed in another pseudo word - 'tatota'. Following the birth, researchers tested the activity of all the babies' brains when they heard the word, using scans . According to the study, those who had been exposed to the word in the womb 'showed an enhanced reaction to this specific word' and were able to detect changes in the word better than babies who had not heard it before. The research demonstrates babies remember the sounds they heard in the womb, despite the fact that when they heard them as foetuses, their brains were still developing the connections that allow them to process any thoughts and external sensations . Professor Huotilainen believes the type of learning detected by the study happens in the later stages of pregnancy and that babies begin to hear sounds and words half way through pregnancy. Responding to the study, Patricia Kuhl, a speech researcher from the University of Washington, said: 'The fact that learning from frequently . presented sounds occurs while infants are still in the womb means that . language learning does not begin on Day 1 at the moment of birth, but . while the infant listens to sounds in utero. It's really quite amazing . that the fetal brain has that capacity.' Professor Huotilainen said parents should be aware that foetuses can hear from the outside world and learn from it and advises them to speak to their unborn babies during pregnancy- or just to other people.","University of Helsinki research found a baby has already learned how his or her family members speak before being born .

The number of under-25s being diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases has climbed almost 50 per cent in ten years. Experts are particularly concerned about the rise of gonorrhoea with rates increasing by a fifth in the past 12 months. They believe the trend is due to a new super-strain of the disease which cannot easily be treated with antibiotics. Carefree youth: Under-25s diagnosed with STIs increased by five per cent since last year and the age group have two-third of chlamydia and over half of gonorrhoea cases (file photo) A report by Public Health England shows there were 448,422 new cases of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in 2012, including chlamydia, herpes and genital warts. The total is up by 5 per cent on the previous year and 46 per cent higher than 2003, when figures were first collected. Experts say the rise is due to teenagers and adults in their early 20s having unprotected sex. But Labour said the figures show a sharp increase in the past three years which they blamed on the Government’s sex education policy. The party accused ministers of teaching youngsters ‘too little too late’ and said they were not doing enough to improve testing and treatment clinics. Experts say the rise in STD's among under-25s is due to teenagers and adults in their early 20s having unprotected sex . Rates are highest among the under-25s and nearly two-third of chlamydia cases and more than half of gonorrhoea infections occurring in this age group. The Public Health England report states: ‘The continuing high STI rates in England suggest too many people are still putting themselves at risk through unsafe sex, especially young adults and men who have sex with men.’ It urges the under-25s to ensure they use protection with ‘casual partners’ and have regular checks at sexual health clinics. Audrey Simpson, of the Family Planning Association, said there was less awareness of the importance of contraception among the young, adding: ‘The worry is that condom use is not being taught in schools. There may be less awareness in people’s conscience.’ Gonorrhoea cases rose from 21,024 to 25,525, up 21 cent, last year. The report adds: ‘High gonorrhoea transmission rates are concerning as the global threat of antibiotic resistance grows. ‘Ensuring treatment-resistant strains of gonorrhoea do not persist and spread remains a public health priority.’ Scientists have previously warned of a super-strain of the illnesswhich could spread very quickly unless better treatments are developed. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The increase in reported STIs over recent years is in part due to better testing, especially for chlamydia and gonorrhoea, and we have also seen improvements in other areas like teenage pregnancy where rates are at their lowest levels since records began. ‘Our approach to tackling sexual health is working … Sex and relationship education is already compulsory in maintained secondary schools, and primary schools are able to decide whether they too want to teach it.'","Under-25s diagnosed with STIs increased by five per cent since last year .

Irwin gets to interact with other people and some animals, and her emotional life has been enriched by being around all the animals. ‘Just me and him together, it's almost like he was feeding off my depression,’ said Carr, who lives in the zoo's staff house. ‘He likes people, he likes to be around people and here, there is something always going on.’ Irwin, however, can't play with the park's other kangaroo, Pluto, who lives near a pond. Carr and zoo founder Joe Schreibvogel are scared Irwin could lose his balance and fall into the water, so they are hoping to build a new kangaroo enclosure in the future. Carr and 3-year-old Irwin arrived at the zoo after spats with officials in Broken Arrow. Now comfortably settled in their new home, Carr has said that the move has been good for both her and Irwin . Carr's therapist had certified Irwin as a therapy pet under the Americans with Disabilities Act. But city officials initially feared Irwin could pose a threat to the public's safety. Native to Australia, healthy male great red kangaroos can grow up to 7 feet tall, weigh more than 200 pounds and bound 25 feet in a single leap. But veterinarians said Irwin would probably not grow larger than 50 pounds because of his injury and because he has been neutered. Irwin has gained about 20 pounds during the past two years and is now able to hop better. The city council eventually voted to create an exotic animal ordinance exemption that allowed Carr to keep Irwin within city limits under certain conditions. On the road to recovery: Irwin has gained about 20 pounds during the past two years and is now able to hop better . The permit required exotic animal owners to, among other things, have a $50,000 liability insurance policy for any injuries inflicted by the animal, certification that the animal has adequate housing and meet all federal and state guidelines for licensing. An anonymous donor paid for Carr's insurance policy. But growing frustration with city officials caused Carr to move herself and Irwin first to Claremore, then to her parents' home in McAlester and, in March, to the zoo. ‘We called her up and offered her a place to stay and Irwin a zoo to hang out with a bunch of other animals, and they've been here ever since,’ said Schreibvogel, who founded the zoo, which is named after his brother who died in a car accident in 1997. The park has close to 800 animals - the majority came from sanctuaries and other zoos - and 18 workers. It's a place, Schreibvogel said, where animals and humans come for a second chance. Peace at last: Christie Carr kisses Irwin the kangaroo at the Garold Wayne Interactive Zoological Park, where they now live, in Wynnewood, Okla . ‘Most of the volunteers here are ex-druggies, ex-alcoholics, on prison's door step,’ he said. ‘Why do people turn to drugs and alcohol? Usually because they don't fit in somewhere. Well, here these animals don't judge you.’ Schreibvogel and Carr have bonded over the backlash they've both received from animal-rights groups. They say it has helped them get to where they are. ‘Everybody has an opinion, and everybody has a right to an opinion,’ Schreibvogel said. ‘If they would have euthanized him three years ago, he wouldn't be walking around, hopping now, so not everyone knows what they are talking about.’ One big happy family: Joe Schreibvogel, left, founder of the Garold Wayne Interactive Zoological Park, has welcomed Christie Carr, right, and Irwin the kangaroo .","Almost two years after fleeing her hometown, Christie Carr and Irwin are enjoying life at their new home .

A former anorexic claims that she owes her life to her gym for banning her when her fitness obsession saw her shrink to a tiny five stone. Caitlin Millar, 21, became addicted to the gym and skipping meals after she began to feel that she was unable to control anything else in her life. While her exercise regime seemed healthy, Ms Miller was losing weight rapidly because she was consuming far fewer calories than her body needed. Caitlin Millar (left), 21, says that she owes her life to her gym for banning her when she became dangerously thin (right). In a year she dropped from weighing 8st 7lbs to weighing just 5st . It was only once she was banned from her gym that she realised how painfully thin she had become. Now, she is finally on the road to recovery - and has been able to start living like any other student at a healthy 8st 9lbs. Ms Millar, from Berkshire, said: ‘I was obsessed with being the best in everything I did whether it was in sports events or school, I had to be the most successful or I wasn’t happy. ‘When I started puberty I couldn’t deal with all the changes happening to my body that I couldn’t control. ‘I had always competed in running and when younger talent started emerging and I wasn’t the best anymore I couldn’t handle it. ‘My weight was something I could control completely and so I started skipping meals and working out more knowing that if I kept control of this then I might regain control of everything else in my life. Ms Millar, who now weighs a healthy 8st 9lbs, says that she started to skip meals and over-exercise when she began to feel that she was losing control of her life . Ms Millar (pictured since her recovery) said: 'My weight was something I could control so I started skipping meals and working out more knowing that if I kept control of this then I might regain control of everything else' ‘When I started at university I became even worse because there was no one there to realise what I was doing or to make sure I didn’t skip meals.’ Ms Millar first began to obsess about her weight when, aged 15, training started to become more of a chore than a hobby and she could feel herself losing grasp of the perfect life she had crafted for herself. Despite being a slim size eight, she felt this was not the best she could be and started skipping meals and heading to the gym as much as she possibly could. Ms Millar (pictured when she was ill) says that her weight loss increased when she started university as there was no one there to ensure that she was not skipping meals . Ms Millar (pictured, left, when she was ill and, right, since she has recovered) says that her health problems began when she struggled to cope with the fact that she was no longer the best runner in competitions . She said: ‘Knowing that there were younger people coming into competing who were better than me was hard. ‘I wanted to regain control of something and so I started to cut meals out and added in more and more gym workouts.’ Aged 18, Ms Millar was a healthy size eight and weighed about eight-and-a-half stone – healthy for her 5ft 6ins frame. But within a year, she had lost more than a third of her body weight, dropping to five stone. Ms Millar (pictured taking part in an athletics competition) said: 'Knowing that there were younger people coming into competing who were better than me was hard' Despite her friends and family mentioning their worries, she was determined to keep losing weight and keep control of that part of her life. Ms Millar said: ‘I had been ill for about two years when one day I was pulled into the office at the gym at university by one of the staff. ‘He sat me down and said that he was going to have to ban me from the gym as people had been commenting on how worried they were about my weight. Ms Millar said: 'I had been ill for about two years when one day I was pulled into the office at the gym at university by one of the staff. He sat me down and said that he was going to have to ban me from the gym' ‘I was furious to know that people had been talking about me behind my back but shocked that they were worried enough to make a comment. ‘I walked away from the gym feeling so embarrassed that I knew something had to change then and there. ‘I trawled the internet for somewhere that could help me and came across the Anorexia Nervosa Intensive Treatment Team. ‘They tailor-made a less terrifying diet plan based on my current food and exercise regimes which gradually built up over time.’ Ms Millar says that being banned from the gym came as a shock to her because she had not realised that she was so thin. As soon as this happened, she started to look for help . Ms Millar has now returned to full health and is able to enjoy university weighing a healthy 8st 9lbs. Her mother said: 'I am so proud that she managed to battle the illness and come out of the other side' Ms Millar’s mother, Alison, said: ‘When Caitlin started becoming obsessed with her weight we knew that this was a battle that she had to face. ‘The more we tried to stop her from doing it the more we pushed her into doing it more. ‘We just had to hope that she got things under control herself. ‘Watching her so poorly was awful but all I could do was support her and try to look after her as much as I could. ‘I’m so happy she is better now though and back to her normal self. ‘I am so proud that she managed to battle the illness and come out of the other side a much better and happier person.’","Caitlin Millar dropped from 8st 7lbs to 5st in a year by skipping meals .

A teenager who was bullied at school because of her partially paralysed face can now smile - after surgeons took muscles from her arm and her leg. Jayella King, 19, had been unable to smile properly because half her face had been paralysed from birth. Ms King, from Tredegar, South Wales, was teased and bullied throughout school because the facial palsy left her unable to move the right side of her mouth. Jayella King, who was bullied at school because of her partially paralysed face, can now smile thanks to a seven-hour operation . Ms King, from South Wales, pictured before the operations, was teased and bullied throughout school because the facial palsy left her unable to move the right side of her mouth . She has even been turned away from pubs because bar staff mistakenly thought she was drunk due to her lopsided smile. The term facial palsy generally refers to . weakness of the facial muscles, mainly resulting from temporary or . permanent damage to the facial nerves, which leaves some people unable to smile, according to charity Facial Palsy UK. When a facial nerve is either . non-functioning or missing, the muscles in the face do not receive the . necessary signals in order to function properly.This results in . paralysis of areas of the face, which can affect movement of . the eyes and mouth. Each side of the face has its own . facial nerve, so damaging the left facial nerve will only affect the . left side of the face, and vice versa. Each nerve starts at the brain . and enters the face to the front of the ear where it then divides into . five separate branches, which supply the muscles that are used . for facial expression. Ms King said she will never forget the moment the bandages came off and she was able to smile for the first time. She is pictured soon after her final operation (left) and once recovered (right) She considered herself different to other . children at primary school and an outcast, but when her mother asked her . before starting secondary school if she wanted an operation to fix her facial palsy, Ms King declined. At secondary school, she was teased but discovered her love of dance. It was not until the age of 16 that Ms King was badly affected by a bully who mimicked her face on a night out when she was dancing and she realised she needed an operation if she was to be able to achieve her goal of becoming a professional dancer. Ms King had her first operation days before her 17th birthday. She said being bullied spurred her on to make the change . She had her first operation days before her 17th birthday while studying dance at perfoming arts college and around two years later is is thrilled that surgeons built her a new smile in the final 7-hour operation by using a muscle from her arm and a nerve from her leg. Ms King said: 'People take smiling for granted everyday but to me its a gift. I can’t stop smiling these days after my operation. 'Suffering from facial palsy is a terrible thing - I was treated like a freak and I felt like one. 'But now when I look in the mirror I feel so happy when I see my smile. Its a dream come true.' Ms King is now studying dance and choreography at university having decided to have the operations to enable her to become a professional dancer.  She is pictured after the operations . Ms King said she will never forget the moment the bandages came off and she was able to smile for the first time. She is now studying dance and choreography at Winchester University and says she is happier than ever. 'I’ve got scars - but they are scars I’m proud of and I’m not afraid to show them off when I’m out' she said. 'Now I want to thank the bullies who spurred me on, making me live my dream. They encouraged me to prove them wrong. 'I wanted to prove I am different to them, not because of my face but because I had a life ambition, I was going somewhere in life.'","Jayella King, from Tredegar, South Wales, was teased and bullied throughout school because of the facial palsy she'd suffered since birth .

The California State Supreme Court denied the District Attorney's petition to block Christopher Hubbart's, now 62, release when he comes up for parole. Now in light of this new ruling, Hubbart, who earned his nickname by putting pillow cases over his female victims heads in order to muffle their screams, may once again be walking the streets where he one-time victims still live. Christopher Hubbart, the California Pillowcase Rapist is set to be released from a state mental institution in a few weeks .

Attorney Jackie Lacey, who's petition was denied by the court, is now seeking to have Hubbart released in a county other than Los Angeles, where he committed his most recent crimes, according to Fox News. 'We aggressively pursued and exhausted all legal avenues to stop the . release of sexually violent predator Christopher Hubbart to Los Angeles . County,' Lacey said according to the news organization. More... Man 'who posted confession and picture of his wife's body on Facebook' pleads NOT GUILTY to murder charges .

Yet officials say that when Hubbart is released the public has nothing to fear as he will be closely monitored. ""Any sex offender, especially one that's a serial rapist, would be . subject to 24-hour supervision with a GPS ankle bracelet, register (as a . sex offender) and be placed under very strong special conditions of . parole,"" California . Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesman Luis Patino told The Los Angeles Daily News.

'It’s more ideal, from a . public safety standpoint, to have him in one location instead of moving . around,' Tracey told the website. Hubbart has been convicted of sexually assaulting over three dozen women . Hubbart has a long history of sexual violence with Lacey had detailed in his petition to the supreme court, Fox News reported. 'He first sexually assaulted a woman when he was a senior in high . school; he reached out and touched her breast as she was walking by' the petition reprinted by Fox News states. 'He repeated that type of assault seven or eight . times before 1971, and about eight to nine times after he started . college in 1971. He would sometime follow women home.' The following year Hubbart committed 26 assaults on women in the Los Angeles area. 'He would drive around in the early morning and look for homes that . had garage doors open, indicating the man of the house had gone to . work,' the petition says. 'He would also look for children’s toys, . believing that mothers would be protective of their children and more . likely to cooperate with him. He would bind the women’s hand and cover . their faces, then sexually assault them.' Hubbart was locked away for his crimes in state hospital, however in 1979 the doctors there deemed him to longer be a public threat. Hubbart was released and moved to the San Francisco area where he soon began attacking more women. He was quickly re-convicted and recommitted to a mental facility. He was once again released in 1990, but was sent back to prison after attacking a female jogger, Fox News reported. In 1996, Hubbart was declared a 'sexually violent predator,' which is a diagnosed mental disorder for people who have been convicted of sexually violent crimes and pose a threat to the safety of others. Hubbart's attorney, Santa Clara County Deputy Public Defender Jeff . Dunn, did not return Fox New's call for comment, but has spoken out in the past in favor of his client's release.

The American Geophysical Union has definitively linked climate change to humanity’s reliance on fossil fuels. In a statement, the Union said that humanity is the major influence on the global climate change observed over the past 50 years. It claimed that human-caused increases in . greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed global . average surface warming of roughly 0.8°C (1.5°F) over the past 140 . years. The American Geophysical Union claims that human-caused increases in greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed global average surface warming of roughly 0.8°C over the past 140 years . 'There is only one thing that is going straight up … that is the greenhouse gases that we are just pumping at an exponential rate,' Gerald North, an atmospheric scientist at Texas A&M University who chaired the committee responsible for the statement, told NBC News. ‘Extensive, independent observations confirm the reality of global warming,’ said the statement. ‘These changes are broadly consistent with long understood physics and predictions of how the climate system is expected to respond to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases. ‘The changes are inconsistent with explanations of climate change that rely on known natural influences.’ The union said the consequences of continuing on this path include deforestation, urbanisation, and particulate pollution which can have complex geographical, seasonal, and longer-term effects on temperature. It added that there is time to lessen the impact by cutting emissions and preparing for changes that are unavoidable. The union said the consequences of continuing to burn fossil fuels include deforestation, urbanisation, and particulate pollution which can have complex geographical, seasonal, and longer-term effects on temperature . The American Geophysical Union is an organisation with over 62,000 members of Earth and space scientists who come from 144 countries. A 15-person panel reviewed and updated the position statement- a task which is done every four years. However, one committee member, Roger Pielke Senior, who is a retired professor of atmospheric sciences at Colorado State University, opposed the statement. Speaking to Georgia Tech climate scientist Judith Curry, Pielke said the statement was an inaccurate view of climate change dominated by the emission of carbon dioxide and a few other greenhouse gases. He said that during the review process, other views were never given an adequate opportunity to be discussed. The American Geophysical Union claims that there is time to lessen the impact by cutting emissions and preparing for changes that are unavoidable . ‘The natural Earth’s climate system, even in the absence of humans, is nonlinear in which forcings and response are not necessarily proportional,’ said Pielke, offering his own explanation. ‘Thus change is often episodic and abrupt, rather than slow and gradual.’ Pielke said that climate change is the result of both human and natural changes. He concluded: ‘The relative role of each in altering atmospheric and ocean circulation features, and even the global annual average radiative forcing, however, is still uncertain.’ American scientists claim the planet is undergoing one of the largest changes in climate in the past 65 million years.Climatologists at Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment have warned the likely rate of change over the next century will be at least 10 times quicker than any climate shift since the dinosaurs became extinct.If the trend continues at its current rapid pace, it will place significant stress on terrestrial ecosystems around the world, and many species will need to make behavioral, evolutionary or geographic adaptations to survive, they said.The findings come from a review of climate research by Earth system science expert Noah Diffenbaugh and Chris Field, a professor of environmental Earth system science and the director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Institution.","The American Geophysical Union believes humans are responsible for a global average surface warming of 0.8°C over the past 140 years .

'Fixated' on minutiae: Former RBS boss Fred Goodwin is described as a 'control freak' in a new account . He was at the helm when the Royal Bank of Scotland collapsed, leaving taxpayers to pick up a £45billion government bailout bill. But despite the demands of running a global financial institution, disgraced boss Fred Goodwin was ‘fixated’ with trifles like the design of company Christmas cards, a new book claims. The man dubbed ‘Fred the Shred’ for his cost-cutting fanaticism was a micro-managing control freak who also banned Sellotape and ordered company cars to be the correct shade of blue. He was obsessed with cleanliness and spent ‘hours in meetings’ poring over colours used in advertising campaigns. But he had ‘very little interest in the traditional components of a bank chief’s activities’, the account claims. And staff who worried that he had a ‘limited grasp’ on RBS’s investment bank were too afraid to voice criticism in case they ended up in ‘Fred’s black book’. The account, called Making it Happen: Fred Goodwin, RBS and the Men who Blew up the Economy, is written by Iain Martin, the former editor of the Scotsman newspaper. He describes how one rant against papers left on filing cabinets led to an order by Mr Goodwin for all cabinets to have dome-shaped tops. ‘Somewhere in a warehouse are thousands of old flat-top RBS filing cabinets that were not Fred-compliant,’ an RBS manager says in the book. Mr Goodwin also ‘became very hands on’ when it came to ordering a new fleet of chauffeur-driven Mercedes for the bank’s executive team. He demanded that the shade of blue must exactly match the RBS logo – and the leather interiors had to be the same shade of beige as the office carpets. ‘He was obsessed by all sorts of small details and measuring things and all sorts of minutiae,’ one of his former colleagues reveals. ‘We would spend hours in meetings discussing the wrong things: colours for advertising campaigns, computer systems and targets were what grabbed him. ‘I think it meant he thought he was on top of things, when he wasn’t.’ When presented with a selection of Christmas card designs, Mr Goodwin ‘blew his top and said they were all terrible’. ‘That’s it, he declared. I’m taking over direct control of the production of the Christmas card,’ the book claims. A previous book revealed Mr Goodwin’s anger at  receiving the wrong type of biscuits at meetings – issuing catering staff  with disciplinary action after he was offered pink wafers. He would often spring surprise inspections on unwary staff ¿ and banned the use of Sellotape in public areas of the bank . The latest account of Mr Goodwin’s management style describes his obsession with cleanliness.While chief executive of Clydesdale Bank, he demanded that a discarded cigarette be removed – after it was spotted by his mother on the steps of the firm’s HQ in Glasgow. He would often spring surprise inspections on unwary staff – and banned the use of Sellotape in public areas of the bank. Those who ignored his edicts would get a ‘sharp rebuke’, the book claims. Divisional managers were even summoned to explain how they had contributed to his cleaning project – with many unable to stifle a laugh at their boss’s clinical obsessions. His pursuit of cleanliness was so rigorous that he was once arrested by police for taking photos outside a Clydesdale branch because the area around its cash machine ‘looked messy’. Mr Goodwin’s wrath was notorious – and even extended even to those closest to him. He once berated David Thorburn, another Clydesdale executive who had been best man at his wedding, in front of an entire room for moving a statue in one of the bank’s branches in Aberdeen.‘He [Fred] went absolutely mental,’ a friend of Mr Thorburn said. Mr Goodwin was also said to enjoy ‘infamously epic’ drinking sessions during team-building away days with senior banking executives. But despite his capacity for ‘large amounts of whisky and beer’, the RBS chief became a ‘demonic corporate robot’ once back in the office, where executives were ‘terrified into submission’. The book also claims the bank ignored a whistleblower who alleged that huge losses were being covered up more than a year before the 2008 bailout. Mr Goodwin, who was knighted in 2004, became a public hate figure four years later when he stepped down following the rescue of RBS, but retained a huge pension deal. He was stripped of his knighthood last year.","Fred the Shred was a control freak who banned Sellotape and ordered company cars to be a certain shade of blue .

Our passion for coffee knows no bounds. Coffee bars dominate the High Street and last year Britons spent £730 million on the beverage. But is it good for us? Studies have led to claims that it might be instrumental in staving off prostate cancer, while others say it might pose risks to the heart. We speak to the experts to find out… . TYPE 2 DIABETES . SPILL THE BEANS Coffee . has been consistently associated with a lower risk of Type 2 diabetes. A . massive review looked at 18 studies involving half-a-million . participants. Each additional cup lowered the risk by a further seven . per cent. WHY It . contains magnesium and chronium, necessary for regulating insulin, . which controls blood sugar. High levels of antioxidants may also prevent . tissue damage. HOW MUCH A . meta-analysis found that those who drank four to six cups daily had a . 28 per cent reduced risk compared with those who drank fewer than two . cups. A 2006 study concluded that diabetes risk was reduced no matter . what type of coffee was consumed. EXPERT . ‘This has the strongest evidence of all health claims,’ says Dr John . Stanley, lecturer in biochemistry at Trinity College, Oxford University. ‘The consistency of the evidence is extraordinary.’ ORAL CANCER . SPILL THE BEANS . A study looking at almost 100,000 cases over 26 years showed a lower . risk of death from oral cancer among coffee drinkers. The more coffee . consumed, the lower the risk. WHY It is thought that the antioxidant compounds in coffee may have anti-cancerous effects. EXPERT . ‘In order to prove this theory, there needs to have been studies . showing the same result around the world,’ says Dr Stanley. ‘Oral cancer . risk factors are alcohol and smoking,’ says dietician Dr Sarah . Schenker. ‘This isn’t proof of protection.’ Healthy cuppa: Several studies have found coffee to have health benefits and help stave off cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's . LIVER DISEASE . SPILL THE BEANS Coffee drinkers have a 40 per cent lower risk of developing liver cancer and an 80 per cent lower risk of developing alcohol-related cirrhosis. WHY High levels of the enzyme GGT are indicative of decreased liver function. Studies show that antioxidants in coffee appear to reduce levels of this enzyme. A 2006 study suggested that non-coffee drinkers with chronic liver disease ought to start consuming the beverage. HOW MUCH Those who drink four cups a day are 80 per cent less likely to develop cirrhosis. EXPERT Andrew Langford, chief executive of the Liver Trust, says: ‘If I had alcohol-related liver disease, I’d be drinking five coffees a day.’ ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE . SPILL THE BEANS A study this year showed that an energy drink containing caffeine enhanced the performances of those taking part in a cycling time-trial. WHY It may have an effect on the part of the central nervous system related to the sensation of effort. Even one mug will have an effect. EXPERT ‘Consuming coffee will give you a small boost,’ says Peter Rogers, professor of biological psychology at Bristol University. Countering cirrhosis: Coffee drinkers have an 80 per cent lower risk of developing alcohol-related liver cirrhosis . PROSTATE CANCER . SPILL THE BEANS A US study said men drinking more than four cups a day had a 59 per cent reduced risk of the cancer recurring. A Swedish study showed men drinking more than six cups a day were 19 per cent less likely to develop this type of cancer. WHY Coffee may boost levels of adiponectin, a protein shown to stop malignant cells flourishing. Obese people tend to have lower levels of this protein – increasing levels may be most beneficial to overweight men. EXPERT ‘Other studies have shown no link,’ says consultant urologist Marc Laniado at Heatherwood Hospital in Ascot. ALZHEIMER'S . SPILL THE BEANS A 2012 study showed that drinking three cups a day reduced the risk. Researchers even suggested that those in their late-30s might benefit from starting to drink three cups a day. WHY Coffee appears to decrease abnormal levels of the protein beta-amyloid, which accumulates in the brains of those with Alzheimer’s. HOW MUCH Three cups of filtered or instant caffeinated coffee a day. EXPERT ‘There is a cluster of  brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and  stroke, where it is clear – for  sound biochemical reasons – that caffeine antagonises effects of adenosine,’ says Dr Stanley. ‘This is turning into a branch of pharmacology – how we design drugs. One trial is looking at the effects of caffeine on the motor aspects of Parkinson’s.’ DEPRESSION . SPILL THE BEANS Staff at the Harvard School of Public Health studied 50,000 women over 24 years. Those who regularly drank four or more cups a day had a 20 per cent lower risk of developing depression. A study in Finland showed that men who drank a lot of coffee were less likely to commit suicide. WHY As it is proven that coffee gives a boost of energy, it may also contribute to long-term mood. EXPERT ‘Two studies are hypothetical rather than conclusive,’ says dietician Dr Schenker. ‘Many factors contribute to depression.’ BENEFICIAL FOR HEART HEALTH . SPILL THE BEANS A meta-analysis involving 150,000 cases showed that those who drank one or two cups a day were 11 per cent less likely to develop heart failure. And the British Heart Foundation says drinking moderate amounts does not lead to heart disease. WHY ‘Any protective effects may be attributed to antioxidant compounds such as chlorogenic acid, which is currently attracting interest,’ says Dr Stanley. However, Jack James, editor of the Journal Of Caffeine Research, claims that caffeine is causing early deaths and  ought to be regulated. EXPERT ‘There is no question that caffeine raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels so that the heart has to work harder – this is clearly not a good thing,’ says Professor Rogers.","Britons spend £730million per year on coffee .

President Barack Obama is planning for the possibility of launching a unilateral American military action against Syria within days after Britain opted out in a stunning vote by Parliament. Facing skepticism at home, administration officials spoke with a group of lawmakers for more than 90 minutes Thursday evening to explain why they believe Bashar Assad's government was the culprit in a suspected chemical attack last week. Afterward, the House Democratic leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, pointedly sided with Republican Speaker John Boehner of Ohio in urging the administration to do more to engage with Congress on the matter. She said the administration needs to . consult more with 'all members of Congress' – a reference to the limited . circle briefed Thursday night – and provide 'additional transparency . into the decision-making process.' Scroll down for video . Strain: David Cameron's failure to secure UK backing for President Barack Obama's intervention in Syria threatens the special relationship . Despite . roadblocks in forming an international coalition, Obama appeared . undeterred and advisers said he would be willing to retaliate against . Syria on his own. 'The . president of the United States is elected with the duty to protect the . national security interests in the United States of America,' White . House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Half of Americans say they oppose taking military action against Syria and nearly 80 percent believe Obama should seek congressional approval before using any force, according to a new NBC poll. After the vote in Parliament Thursday, Britain’s . ‘special relationship’ with the United States is under threat, . David Cameron has been warned. Urgent . calls were made to the White House last night soon after the government . defeat amid claims by one Whitehall official that Britain had ‘handed . back its deputy sheriff badge.' Chancellor . George Osborne warned Britain must undertake ‘national soul-searching’ about its place in the world as Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned . the special relationship was now under ‘strain’. Diplomatic experts also voiced deep concerns that the repercussions for Britain’s standing on the world stage would be long-lasting. The Henry Jackson Society said last night's Commons vote has damaged Britain's reputation as a major global power and also sent a worrying message to dictators, while the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said it was an embarrassment. Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown said the defeat in the Commons had left the UK a ‘hugely diminished country’. The influential Tory grassroots website ConservativeHome said Mr Cameron had suffered 'the worst foreign policy defeat in modern times'. Mr Cameron had promised Mr Obama he would stand should to shoulder with the US in taking military action against the Assad regime after the devastating chemical weapons attack in Damascus last week. To add further embarrassment, French president Francois Hollande said his country was prepared to stand alongside America and 'punish' Syrian leader Bashar Assad. He said: ‘The chemical massacre at . Damascus cannot and must not remain unpunished. Otherwise, we take the . risk of an escalation that would normalise the use of these weapons, and . threaten other countries. 'Each country is free to choose whether to take part in such an operation or not. That holds true for Britain and France.' Prime Minister David Cameron recalled Parliament to stage an emergency vote to endorse UK involvement in missile strikes. But MPs voted by 272 votes to 285 to reject Mr Cameron’s motion backing British intervention in principle. It is the first time that Parliament has voted against the government on a matter of war and peace since 1782, and raises the prospect of the US having to go it alone. Mr Hammond said: ‘It’s certainly going to place some strain on the special relationship.’ He said the Americans ‘have been surprised by the scale of opposition in Parliament, and perhaps they will struggle a bit to understand the very special reasons that there are for that view in Parliament’. Debate: A chastened Mr Cameron was forced by Labour leader Ed Miliband to pledge not to deploy any UK military forces without first staging another Commons vote . Downing Street sources stressed that there had been ‘understanding’ from the White House about the outcome of the vote. But there was acknowledgement that it permanently altered the assumption that Britain and the US would act together in military operations around the world. Chancellor Mr Osborne insisted the relationship with the US is a ‘very old one, very deep and operates on many layers’ and there had been 'a bit of hyperbole' about the impact of the vote. But he suggested the UK was now at a crucial crossroads in deciding the role it plays in global politics. ‘I think there will be a national soul-searching about our role in the world and whether Britain wants to play a big part in upholding the international system, be that big open and trading nation that I'd like us to be or whether we turn our back on that,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘I understand the deep scepticism that my colleagues in Parliament many members of the public have about British involvement in Syria. ‘I hope this doesn’t become the moment where we turn our back on the world’s problems.’ Ally: US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters during a visit to the Philippines that America would still consult Britain . Alarm: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (left) said the Commons vote put the special relationship under 'strain' while Chancellor George Osborne warned Britain against turning its back on the world . White House officials cautiously suggested Mr Obama was prepared to launch strikes against Syria without British support. But asked if the US would go it alone, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said: ‘The opinion of others in this situation matters.’ US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said America still wanted to secure international backing for any military intervention. Speaking during a trip to the Philippines, he said: 'It is the goal of President Obama and our government ... whatever decision is taken, that it be an international collaboration and effort. 'Our approach is to continue to find an international coalition that will act together. And I think you're seeing a number of countries state, publicly state, their position on the use of chemical weapons.' But Robin Wright, a Middle East analyst for the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Centre, told The Times that the vote ‘complicates life and this has bigger implications about the nature of the relationship between the United States and its closest ally’. Dr Alan Mendoza, executive director of the trans-Atlantic think tank the Henry Jackson Society, said: ‘If not reversed, this vote means the UK will join the rank of third-rate nations, condemned to be the prisoner of events and with no power to shape them. ‘This is a shameful result which will not be readily forgotten by our allies. We can be certain that more atrocities will follow in Syria.’ RUSI director general Professor Michael Clarke said the decision not to go ahead with military intervention would prove an embarrassment for Britain on the international stage. Lord Ashdown, who appeared in front of Lib Dem MPs with leader Nick Clegg yesterday in an attempt to persuade rebels to back the government, wrote on Twitter: ‘In 50 years trying to serve my country I have never felt so depressed/ashamed. Britain's answer to the Syrian horrors? none of our business!’ Labour leader Ed Miliband insisted that the UK-US relationship 'remains strong' despite last night's vote. He said: 'I do think there's a lesson for Britain, though, which is that we must lead in the right way for Britain from our national interest and indeed our global interest. 'Now sometimes that will mean agreeing with what America is doing and the way it's going about things, and sometimes it will mean doing things in a different way.'","Half of Americans say they oppose taking .

"By . Shari Miller . PUBLISHED: . 05:21 EST, 30 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:37 EST, 30 August 2013 . The 11-year-old son of Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, has apparently dared the United States to launch an attack, in a Facebook taunt that has been 'liked' by the children and grandchildren of other senior Syrian officials. 'I just want them to attack sooo much, . because I want them to make this huge mistake of beginning something . that they don’t know the end of it,' stated the post on an account said to belong to Hafez al-Assad. The comments were posted in response to moves by the US to launch a strike in response to a chemical weapons attack on August 21. Daring the Americans: A Facebook post said to be written by the 11-year-old son of President Assad asks for the United States to attack and 'make a huge mistake' However, the authenticity of the Facebook profile is hard to confirm. While it shows a younger picture of Hafez, the owner's profile also states that he is a a graduate of Oxford University and a player for a Barcelona soccer team - neither of which are likely for an 11-year-old boy living in Damascus. But it does also state that he is a graduate of a Montessori school in Damascus, a detail confirmed within a profile on Hafez's mother, Asma al-Assad, which appeared in Vogue in February 2011. The post has also attracted many 'likes' and comments from accounts appearing to belong to the families of members of Assad's administration. Among these are comments apparently posted by the two children of Deputy Vice President Mohammed Nassif Khierbek, Ali and Sally, and three children of a former deputy defence minister, Assef Shawkat, who was killed in a bombing in July 2012. A Syrian journalist from Damascus, who wished to remain anonymous, told the New York Times that the accounts belonging to Mr Shawkat's son, Bassel and daughters, Anisseh and Boushra, appeared to be authentic. Stepping into the political arena? Hafez pictured with his father Bashar al-Assad several years ago . The children are also direct cousins of Hafez al-Assad, as Mr Shawkat was married to the Syrian president's sister. Many of the Facebook profile pictures of those who commented have been changed to show pictures of the Syrian premier or his father, also named Hafez, who ruled the country for 30 years before his son took power in 2000. The post is also littered with spelling and grammar mistakes, which would not be unusual for a child author. Whether authentic or not, the post illustrates the support that President Assad continues to garner, despite a two-year civil war that has killed more than 1000,000 Syrians and caused millions to flee for their lives. The post also shows that those who do support Assad are unafraid of any United States retaliation. 'They may have the best army in the world, maybe the best airplanes, ships, tanks than ours, but soldiers? 'No one has soldiers like the ones we do in Syria. America doesn’t have soldiers, what it has is some cowards with new technology who claim themselves liberators.' The author also compares any possible action by America to the 2006 war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, one of the Assad regime's closest allies in the current conflict. In a chilling taunt, the post stated: 'What did Hezbollah have . back then? Some street fighters and some small rockets and a pile of . guns, but they had belief, In theirselves and in their country and . that’s exactly what’s gonna happen to America if it chooses invasion . because they don’t know our land like we do, no one does, victory is . ours in the end no matter how much time it takes.' Investigation: A member of a UN team takes samples near a missile believed to be one of the chemical rockets fired at civilians in Damascus last week . Civil war: Free Syrian Army fighters run from snipers loyal to Syria's President Bashar Al-Assad .

Education Secretary Michael Gove unleashed his tirade after it was revealed the Government had lost its motion by 13 votes, calling the rebels 'traitors' Tory MP Sarah Wollaston told  Radio 4’s Today programme that humanitarian assistance to Syria should not ‘come in the form of cruise missiles’. She said: ‘I think this was a good day for Parliament because this was Parliament reflecting the view, very widely held across the country, that we should not be drawn into yet another Middle Eastern conflict.’ Crispin Blunt, a former justice minister, said it was unnecessary for the UK to ‘put our hand on the dagger politically’ alongside the US. Prime Minister David Cameron dramatically lost his vote in the Commons today . He said he was ‘delighted that the UK relieve ourselves of this imperial pretention’. He added that a country the size of the UK should not seek to be ‘involved in every conceivable conflict that is going on’.

Chancellor George Osborne warned Britain . must undertake ‘national soul-searching’ about its place in the world . as Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned the special relationship was . now under ‘strain’. Diplomatic experts also voiced deep concerns that the repercussions for Britain’s standing on the world stage would be long-lasting. The New York Daily News front page today was the most striking in the States today, featuring a glum picture of Mr Obama with the headline: The British aren't coming! The British aren't coming!' The Wall Street Journal said 'US prepares for solo strike on Syria after Britain balks' while the New York Times said Mr Cameron had suffered a 'stunning parliamentary defeat' which was a 'sign of Cameron's weakness'. The Henry Jackson Society said last night's Commons vote has damaged Britain's reputation as a major global power and also sent a worrying message to dictators, while the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said it was an embarrassment. The Wall Street Journal front page read: 'US prepares for solo strike on Syria after Britain balks' The Washington Post said: 'White House: Obama can go it along on Syria' The Boston Globe front page read: 'In face of resistance, Obama is ready to act alone' The New York Times said: 'Obama set for limited strike on Syria as British vote no' Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown said the defeat in the Commons had left the UK a ‘hugely diminished country’. The influential Tory grassroots website ConservativeHome said Mr Cameron had suffered 'the worst foreign policy defeat in modern times'. Mr Cameron had promised Mr Obama he would stand should to shoulder with the US in taking military action against the Assad regime after the devastating chemical weapons attack in Damascus last week. But he now faces the prospect of attending next week's G20 summit in St Petersburg as a much diminished figure, unable to make commit Britain's military might while sitting around the negotiating table with the world's most powerful leaders. To add further embarrassment, French president Francois Hollande said his country was prepared to stand alongside America and 'punish' Syrian leader Bashar Assad. He said: ‘The chemical massacre at . Damascus cannot and must not remain unpunished. Otherwise, we take the . risk of an escalation that would normalise the use of these weapons, and . threaten other countries. 'Each country is free to choose whether to take part in such an operation or not. That holds true for Britain and France.' Prime Minister David Cameron recalled Parliament to stage an emergency vote to endorse UK involvement in missile strikes. But MPs voted by 272 votes to 285 to reject Mr Cameron’s motion backing British intervention in principle. It is the first time that Parliament has voted against the government on a matter of war and peace since 1782, and raises the prospect of the US having to go it alone. Mr Hammond said: ‘It’s certainly going to place some strain on the special relationship.’ He said the Americans ‘have been surprised by the scale of opposition in Parliament, and perhaps they will struggle a bit to understand the very special reasons that there are for that view in Parliament’. Downing Street sources stressed that there had been ‘understanding’ from the White House about the outcome of the vote. But . there was acknowledgement that it permanently altered the assumption . that Britain and the US would act together in military operations around . the world. Chancellor Mr . Osborne insisted the relationship with the US is a ‘very old one, very . deep and operates on many layers’ and there had been 'a bit of . hyperbole' about the impact of the vote. But he suggested the UK was now at a crucial crossroads in deciding the role it plays in global politics. ‘I . think there will be a national soul-searching about our role in the . world and whether Britain wants to play a big part in upholding the . international system, be that big open and trading nation that I'd like . us to be or whether we turn our back on that,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s . Today programme. ‘I . understand the deep scepticism that my colleagues in Parliament many . members of the public have about British involvement in Syria. ‘I hope this doesn’t become the moment where we turn our back on the world’s problems.’ White House officials cautiously suggested Mr Obama was prepared to launch strikes against Syria without British support. But . asked if the US would go it alone, White House spokesman Josh Earnest . said: ‘The opinion of others in this situation matters.’ US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said America still wanted to secure international backing for any military intervention. Speaking . during a trip to the Philippines, he said: 'It is the goal of President . Obama and our government ... whatever decision is taken, that it be an . international collaboration and effort. 'Our . approach is to continue to find an international coalition that will . act together. And I think you're seeing a number of countries state, . publicly state, their position on the use of chemical weapons.' Debate: A chastened Mr Cameron was forced by Labour leader Ed Miliband to pledge not to deploy any UK military forces without first staging another Commons vote . But . Robin Wright, a Middle East analyst for the Washington-based Woodrow . Wilson Centre, told The Times that the vote ‘complicates life and this . has bigger implications about the nature of the relationship between the . United States and its closest ally’. Dr . Alan Mendoza, executive director of the trans-Atlantic think tank the . Henry Jackson Society, said: ‘If not reversed, this vote means the UK . will join the rank of third-rate nations, condemned to be the prisoner . of events and with no power to shape them. ‘This . is a shameful result which will not be readily forgotten by our allies. We can be certain that more atrocities will follow in Syria.’ RUSI . director general Professor Michael Clarke said the decision not to go . ahead with military intervention would prove an embarrassment for . Britain on the international stage. Ally: US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters during a visit to the Philippines that America would still consult Britain . Alarm: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (left) said the Commons vote put the special relationship under 'strain' while Chancellor George Osborne warned Britain against turning its back on the world . Lord Ashdown, who appeared in front of Lib Dem MPs with leader Nick Clegg yesterday in an attempt to persuade rebels to back the government, wrote on Twitter: ‘In 50 years trying to serve my country I have never felt so depressed/ashamed. Britain's answer to the Syrian horrors? none of our business!’ Labour leader Ed Miliband insisted that the UK-US relationship 'remains strong' despite last night's vote. He said: 'I do think there's a lesson for Britain, though, which is that we must lead in the right way for Britain from our national interest and indeed our global interest. 'Now sometimes that will mean agreeing with what America is doing and the way it's going about things, and sometimes it will mean doing things in a different way.'","US media mock 'weak' Cameron for failing to deliver support for great ally .

A scandal-hit hospital trust will be dissolved and critical care, maternity and paediatric services at Stafford Hospital cut under health administrators' proposals. The hospital will keep its current part-time accident and emergency department but will lose other services in a major shake-up. Trust Special Administrators (TSA), appointed by the Department of Health in April, said in their report outlining the proposals that 'there is no alternative but to make significant change' at Stafford and neighbouring Cannock Chase Hospital. The scandal-hit Stafford hospital trust will be dissolved and critical care, maternity and paediatric services at cut under health administrators' proposals. The hospital will keep its current part-time A&E department . The recommendations, which will now be subject to public consultation, mean Stafford Hospital's A&E department - which shuts between 10pm and 8am - has escaped the cuts. However, major emergency surgery and most trauma care, neonatal services and paediatric inpatient services, with the exception of its assessment unit, would all be moved to other hospitals in the region. The TSA said their recommendations would mean 91 per cent of patients currently using services would still be accessing care at the hospitals if the changes went ahead. Among services, which are proposed to stay at Stafford, are elective surgery, adult inpatient care, as well as out-patient and diagnostic appointments, all of which will be largely unaffected by the shake-up.

Among the services that are proposed to stay the hospital are elective surgery, adult inpatient care, as well as out-patient and diagnostic appointments . The report's authors say that without major change 'future local patient safety is at stake' pointing to the trust's small size as one reason why care at the trust in its current form cannot safely continue, in the long-term. It is also proposing the trust is dissolved and the hospitals be run by neighbouring trusts, in a bid to save money. Stafford Hospital was the focus of a major public inquiry after it was found poor care may have led to the deaths of hundreds of patients as a result of maltreatment and neglect. The Francis Inquiry highlighted 'appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people' under the trust's care, with some patients left lying in their own faeces for days, forced to drink water from vases or given the wrong medication. The administrators said smaller trusts like Mid Staffordshire can neither hire or retain enough specialist doctors to give patients the proper standard of clinical care, while the NHS nationally is already moving towards a model providing larger specialist centres. A blue ribbon of the 'Save Stafford Hospital Campaign' adorns the fencing outside Stafford Hospital. Administrators have proposed the trust is dissolved and the hospitals be run by neighbouring trusts, in a bid to save money . Administrators were appointed in April after an independent review on behalf of health watchdog Monitor concluded the trust was 'neither clinically nor financially sustainable' in the long term. Last year, the Department of Health had to give the trust £20 million to maintain patient service, with the report's authors stating 'the trust is already spending far more than it earns'. The TSA came up with its draft recommendations after discussions with patient groups, the public and clinicians including hospital trusts in Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton, and the local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) which buy in health services for the area. If the proposals go ahead, it is anticipated the services identified to be migrated from Stafford Hospital will have moved across to neighbouring hospitals in the region within two or three years. Those services will instead be provided in the main by the University of North Staffordshire NHS Trust, and The Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust, although the TSA has identified other healthcare providers interested in taking on some aspects of care.

At the time, the Kings Norton Metal Company was making British West Africa pennies for use in the colonies of Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leonne and the Gambia. During a production run of standard pennies two blanks for British West Africa pennies made it into the batch. When the mistake was realised, one was thrown back into the furnace and the other was kept by the engineer. The copper-nickel coin was then passed to Francis Edward Brown, a local industrialist, and has remained in his family ever since. Accompanying the coin is a letter from Mr Brown in which he describes it as a 'nickel penny - the only one in the world'. Paperwork proving the coin's history will be included in the auction.

Costumes worn in the hit drama Downton Abbey have gone on display in the village where many of the scenes are filmed. Ten costumes from the third series of Downton are on show at the West Ox Art Gallery in Bampton, Oxfordshire, which is frequently used as a location for Downton village. Indeed, Bampton’s village church, St Mary’s, provided the location for the weddings of Lady Mary (played by Michelle Dockery) and Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael). As part of the display visitors will be able to see a mixture of clothes from the ‘upstairs’ members of the Downton household and the ‘downstairs’, with weighty, embroidered gowns taking their place beside more simple staff uniforms. A dress worn by Lady Rose McClare in the series demonstrates the muted palette popular at the time, with natural indigo dyes used to colour the cloth. The village church has been the scene of much drama, having seen the wedding of Matthew and Lady Mary - and the jilting of Lady Edith . Classy in crimson: An evening dress worn by Lady Mary Crawley is a copy of a gown designed by Madeleine Vionnet in the 1920s on display in a new Downton Abbey exhibit at West Ox Art Gallery, Bampton, Oxforshire . Royal blue: Lady Mary wore this coat with a floral collar upon return from her honeymoon . A dress worn by Lady Rose McClare on show reveals the care and attention the costume department put into recreating the look of the period in which it was set: 1920 through to the autumn of 1921. Costume designer Caroline McFall, who holds a Designers Guild award and an Emmy for her work on the show, says she doesn’t try to exactly copy outfits worn at the time, but instead translate them using the same aesthetic, making sure the style is appealing to a modern audience. With season three opening at the beginning of the 1920s, costumes were shorter, less ornate and incorporated more art deco and flapper detailing. Daywear is simple, using natural fabrics and dyes, and always worn with a hat, while evening gowns feature plenty of beading and are accessorised with headbands. The hotly anticipated fourth season is about to start on ITV and promises to deliver the high drama the show has become known for. The exhibition, which runs until 29 September, also includes artworks inspired by the series. Admission costs £5. Back to black: This dark embroidered evening dress was worn by Maggie Smith's character Violet Crawley, Countess of Grantham . Purple passion: This patterned evening dress was worn by Lady Cora Crawley, played by Elizabeth McGovern, and right, this burnt umber drop-waisted frock and hat belongs to Lady Edith Crawley, played by Laura Carmichael .

Prosecutors today vowed to appeal the 30-day sentence handed down to a high school teacher who repeatedly raped a 14-year-old student before she killed herself. The meager sentence given by Judge G. Todd Baugh to Stacey Rambold, 54, in a Billings, Montana court last month sparked protests and an online petition calling for the judge's resignation. 'Certainly I'm disappointed in this sentence, but I have a job to do, and my job right now is to figure out if this case can be appealed because of some legal error,' Scott Twito, the county attorney told NBC on Tuesday. Last Thursday, around 400 protesters headed to the the county courthouse to call for the resignation of the state district judge, while around 45,000 people have signed a petition demanding he resign. Meager sentence: Cherice Moralez, left, shot herself dead after she was raped by her teacher, Stacey Rambold, right. A judge has caused outraged by giving him just a 30-day sentence for his crimes . Controversial: Judge G. Todd Baugh sentence has sparked outrage and will be reviewed . Organizers have endorsed Baugh's description of himself as a 'blithering idiot' for having said the victim, Cherice Moralez, acted 'older than her chronological age' and was in control of the situation. 'We will no longer stand by while individuals speak about victims in this way,' Kate Olp, the petition organizer, said. Baugh has defended the 30-day sentence and said he did not intend to resign. The victim's mother told Today that the sentence left her 'horrified'. 'I don't believe in justice anymore. It was a joke,' she said. Victim: The judge said that Cherry, pictured, acted older than her age - comments which sparked outrage . Rambold was originally charged with three felony counts of sexual intercourse without consent in 2008 when officials at Billings Senior High School first became aware of the sexual relationship. Victim Cherice Moralez committed suicide . on February 6, 2010. She shot herself in her mother’s bed just three . weeks before her 17th birthday. According to her mother, Auliea . Hanlon, the pending trial of teacher Stacey Rambold - 49 when the rapes . were committed - and trauma of the abuse were 'major factors' in her . daughter's death. Speaking . to MailOnline Mrs Hanlon said that her daughter had been 'in hell,' shunned by classmates and bullied following the revelations of the . abuse. Her death complicated the prosecution . of former teacher Rambold, now 54. Heartbroken: Her mother Auliea Hanlon listens during a protest last Thursday against the sentence . Prosecutors who had sought to put Rambold behind bars instead settled for a three-year deferred prosecution. According . to the terms of the agreement the case would be dismissed after this . term if Rambold pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse . without consent and entered a three-stage sex offender treatment . program. But he was kicked out of the treatment program for missing meetings and having unsupervised visits with his nieces and nephews, who are minors. In April, he pleaded guilty to a single felony count. At his sentencing hearing last Monday, prosecutors asked the judge to put Rambold behind bars for 20 years, but Baugh said he didn't think the violations were serious enough. In a written explanation, the judge maintained that these violations were 'not significant'. Outrage: An estimated 400 people attended a protest rally against the sentence in Billings, Montana . Anger: Protesters have called for the judge's resignation but he has said he will not step down . He . stated: 'There were violations of the treatment program, but involved . no violence, no inappropriate sexual conduct, and no new criminal . activity. 'Defendant's old . treatment provider recommended that the Defendant still be assessed as a . low risk offender and treatable in the community. 'Knowing that the Defendant had enrolled . in another sexual offender treatment program, the Court is faced with . deciding if the Defendant should go to prison for relatively minor . infractions.' After Rambold's 30 days in jail, he will be on probation for 15 years and he must register as a sex offender. Speaking to MailOnline Cherry’s mother . said: ‘Rambold took away everything beautiful in my life and he just . gets to walk away. He confessed.

Both sides were in a Nowata County . court on Friday. The Oklahoma Supreme Court granted an emergency stay to . the Nowata court's ruling that Veronica should be transferred . immediately to the Capobiancos. Veronica's birth mother put her up for adoption. Brown . is Veronica's birth father and a member of the Cherokee Nation. He . fought the Capobiancos' adoption of Veronica under the Indian Child . Welfare Act. The stay comes after Brown turned himself in to authorities on August 12, but refused extradition to South Carolina. That's where Veronica's adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Capobianco live and where state authorities had finalized Veronica's adoption and charged Brown with 'custodial interference' for refusing to turn over the girl. 'This is my daughter,' Brown said, according to Anderson Cooper 360. 'It isn't a yoyo I borrowed for two years.' Brown posted $10,000 bond and was released on August 12, according to Oklahoma's Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office.

Last week, a lawyer appointed to look out for the best interests of the three-year-old asked a judge to suspend visitation rights for her adoptive parents - a complete turnaround after the South Carolina court awarded the Capobiancos custody of Veronica on July 31. The James Island, South Carolina parents have been trying to adopt Veronica since her birth in 2009. after which they raised the girl for two years. But Brown has had custody of his daughter since 2011, when South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled that a 1978 federal law written to ensure Native American children stay with Native American parents gave him preference over the Capobiancos. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law does not apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of Veronica and abandoned her before birth. Veronica, her biological father Dusten Brown, feed their geese and ducks at his home in Oklahoma where she has lived for the past 19 months . In the middle: Veronica has been caught in an ongoing tug of war custody battle for most of her young life . 'I'm always going to be her daddy': Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011 . Brown had never met his daughter and, after Veronica's non-Indian mother rebuffed his marriage proposal, played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the girl was born. The legal proceedings began when Brown found out Veronica was going to be adopted. He objected and said the Indian Child Welfare Act favored the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions. The Capobiancos appealed the South Carolina Supreme Court's 2011 decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and it ruled in June that South Carolina courts should decide who gets to adopt Veronica. The state court said the Capobiancos should raise the girl. Last week, South Carolina Family Court Judge Daniel Martin finalized the couple's adoption, approving a transition plan detailing a gradual process for reintroducing the girl to the Capobiancos. South Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Brown's arrest Saturday, charging Brown with custodial interference for failing to appear with the girl for a court-ordered meeting with the Capobiancos on August 4th — a date the couple has said was set by the judge and to which Brown's attorneys did not object.","Melanie and Matt Capobianco of James Island, S.C., have been trying to .

Barely two weeks old and sleeping for the camera, this is Maud Elizabeth Daphne Marina - the latest addition to the Royal Family. The daughter of Lord Freddie Windsor and Sophie Winkleman has taken part in her first celebrity photo shoot. Maud’s parents are flanked by her proud grandparents, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, who appear to have colour co-ordinated their outfits to celebrate the arrival of a baby girl. New addition: Baby Muad sleeps peacefully in her mother Sophie Winkleman's arms as new grandparents Prince and Princess Michael of Kent (left and right) and proud father Lord Frederick Windsor look on . Prince Michael has also left enough of his pink shirt unbuttoned to reveal a gold crucifix hanging against his chest. Perhaps his decision to reveal so much chest was influenced by the inhabitants of Los Angeles, where his first grandchild was born on August 15th. The Michaels’ daughter in law has said she hopes to introduce her daughter to Prince George over Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace. She told Hello! Magazine that the birth, at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre in Los Angeles was ‘long and hard’.

Meeting of the Royal babies: The new mother said she hopes to introduce baby Maud to Prince George at a family gathering this Christmas . The 33-year-old said: ‘By the end I was begging for a caesarean thinking, I can’t do this anymore - but I managed a natural birth with some wonderful doctors and midwives along with Freddie in the room with me, who were just stunningly brilliant, saying, “You can do this!”. Their dynamic, American positivity carried me through.’ Explaining their choice of name, Lord Freddie, 34, said: ‘We liked the idea of an old-fashioned English name and there are a couple of Princess Mauds in my father’s family from a hundred years ago - one was the youngest daughter of Edward VII who ended up being Queen of Norway, and another was a granddaughter of Edward VII by his daughter Princess Louise. ‘It’s also a beautiful, elegant name and it was always our first choice. Elizabeth is a tribute to the Queen, Daphne is Sophie’s grandmother, who she was very close to and Marina is my paternal grandmother.’ Welcome to the world: Baby Maud is introduced to the nation on the front cover of Hello! Ms Winkleman, said of her financial analyst husband being present at the birth: ‘He was very brave, because it wasn’t delicate or pretty and I was horrid to him. ‘He read me a crossword clue in the middle of it and I just wanted to throw a saucepan at his head.’ Speaking about his granddaughter, who is 42nd in line to the throne, Prince Michael said: ‘We are absolutely thrilled by the arrival of our beautiful first granddaughter, Maud. ‘We are both besotted with her. 'Not only does she have the prettiest blue eyes and adorable tiny feet, but she is also remarkably well-behaved.’ His wife said they had not met Prince George yet, because they had been on holiday and were ‘preoccupied’ with Maud’s arrival, but hoped to do so at Christmas. Ms Winkleman, who has starred in the TV sitcoms Peep Show and Two And A Half Men, and married Lord Windsor in September 2009, said: ‘Perhaps we’ll introduce the babies at Buckingham Palace for the Christmas lunch, that would be very sweet.’ The full photo-shoot and interview is available in HELLO! magazine, on sale now.","Two-week-old Maud Elizabeth Daphne Marina was born in Los Angeles .

Passengers on a cross-country Greyhound bus have criticised the firm for allegedly exposing them to a deadly illness by allowing a sick man to travel alongside them. Customers spent two days travelling from Los Angeles to Dallas with a fellow passenger who was coughing up blood and may have been suffering from tuberculosis. The driver stopped the bus and called an ambulance - but paramedics said they were unable to test him for the disease and he was allowed to continue. Anger: Passengers claim they were exposed to illness on a Greyhound bus (file photo) Passengers were apparently told that it would be pointless to exit the bus at that point as they had already been exposed to the ill man for so long. Now they have spoken out, claiming that Greyhound should have taken better care of their health and done more to redress the problem. The incident is reminiscent of a scene . in the 1969 film Midnight Cowboy in which the health of character Rizzo, . played by Dustin Hoffman, seriously deteriorates over the course of a . bus ride from New York to Miami. The character eventually passes away yet the bus driver continues the journey to Miami. The sick man boarded the bus in Los Angeles on Saturday, according to CBS DFW, but his condition deteriorated during the journey to Texas. 'We noticed how sick he was and then he started coughing and hacking up blood,' passenger Erin Dent said. By the time the bus was nearing its destination in Dallas, passengers demanded that the man should be forced to leave because he could infect them. The Greyhound vehicle stopped in the . town of Van Horn and the patient was examined by paramedics, who said it . would take two days to determine if he was suffering from TB.

Danger: A man was allowed to carry despite coughing up blood, according to passengers (file photo) Many of the passengers wanted to get off the bus because of the risk of infection, but paramedics said there was no need. 'I'd already been with him a day and a half,' Doreen Krueger said. 'The ambulance said it wouldn't make any difference if [I had] already been exposed.' The ill man was told he could continue to ride the bus as long as he wore a mask, but according to some passengers the man was deaf and would not obey the instruction. When the bus reached Dallas, customers were offered complaint forms by Greyhound, but they say that the company's response has been inadequate. 'If we've been exposed then everybody we come in contact with from now on can be exposed, so we're real concerned about our families,' Ms Dent told CBS. Greyhound denied putting passengers in danger, saying that the driver followed correct protocol and the passenger wore a mask when asked to do so. Local health officials have offered free TB tests to anyone who travelled on the bus.","Sick man travelled on two-day journey from Los Angeles to Dallas .

Ketamine could relieve the symptoms of depression in as little as 24 hours, new research suggests . Ketamine could relieve the symptoms of depression in as little as 24 hours, new research suggests. The drug, which is also used in anaesthesia, can relieve symptoms in more than 60 per cent of people with depression within 24 hours. In contrast, most prescription anti-depressants take four to six weeks to prove effective. The findings come after the biggest ever study to examine ketamine’s effect on depression. Some 73 people with the condition were involved in the U.S. study, with two thirds given ketamine, and one third midazolam – a short-acting anaesthetic medication. The researchers found that 64 per cent of those given ketamine improved within 24 hours. In contrast, only 28 per cent of those given midazolam improved. The research was carried out at the Michael E. DeBakey . Veterans Affairs Medical Centre, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, . and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, . Lead researcher, Dr Sanjay Mathew, said: ‘Through this study, we’ve now confirmed in an optimised trial design that ketamine does have robust and rapid antidepressant effects.’ Ketamine was given to the patients intravenously and in very low doses. Dr Mathew explained: ‘All previous studies of ketamine have compared it to saline, an inert placebo without physical or psychological reactions. ‘The problem with this is that ketamine has usual side effects, such as feelings of floating, feelings of altered sense of time, maybe some blurred vision or some other physical or psychological symptoms. ‘Patients know that they received something active and the raters would know that as well, so the validity of the study may be in doubt with saline studies. ‘This is the first trial to compare ketamine to another drug that also has psychoactive properties.’ Dr Mathew and his colleagues followed the patients for seven days and found that many of the patients who received ketamine continued to benefit from the treatment after seven days, although there was a decrease in benefits by day seven. The drug, which is also used in anaesthesia, can relieve symptoms in more than 60 per cent of people with depression within 24 hours. Image shows the ketamine molecular model . They then studied the subgroup of . patients who did well at day seven to see how long they remained . depression-free and found that a small group of patients were able to . remain depression-free for an additional four weeks. Dr Mathew says that there is still much more that needs to be understood before ketamine can be used clinically. For example, the best dose to use would have to be established and side effects, such as elevated blood pressure, would have to be taken into account. The researchers believe that ketamine . reduces depression by influencing the glutamate system – glutamate are . neurotransmitters which speed up the transmission of information from . one nerve cell to the next. Severe depression could be more common in men than women, new research suggests. It has long been thought that women are 70 per cent more likely to suffer from severe depression than men are. However, the new study suggests that if the symptoms of depression in men are properly diagnosed, the condition could be just as common, if not more common, in men than it is in women. According to the research, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, this could explain why men are four times more likely to commit suicide than women are. The Los Angeles Times reports that when symptoms such as rage, risk-taking and substance abuse are taken into consideration, the number of men diagnosed with depression increases significantly. It is thought that many men with depression are currently not diagnosed because their symptoms can be very different to those seen in women with the condition. ‘When it comes to depression in men, to some extent we have blinders on,’ Dr Andrew Leuchter, a psychiatrist at UCLA told the Los Angeles Times. ‘We have not been asking about and taking into account a range of symptoms that may be gender-specific.’ Common symptoms of depression include feeling down, difficulty sleeping, feeling guilty, feeling worthless and a loss of interest in hobbies. However, particularly in men, symptoms can also include anger, aggression and hyperactivity.","The benefits from one dose of the drug can last for up to five weeks .

For many children growing up in the 1990s, Sonic the Hedgehog was one of the coolest characters to feature in a computer game . For many children growing up in the 1990s, Sonic the Hedgehog was one of the coolest characters to feature in a computer game. As video games were in their infancy, most people were thrilled with the heavily pixelated graphics, but never got to see 'Green Hill' - the setting of Act 1 from the original Sonic the Hedgehog game released in 1991 - from the speedy hedgehog's point of view. However, a stomach-churning video now lets nostalgic gamers see the game as they never have before as they race along and dodge obstacles as Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic made his first major appearance in the now-iconic game, Sonic . the Hedgehog, for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis where he ran through 2D . levels to try and save the 'world' from his nemesis, Dr. Robotinic. The character is a blue 15-year-old anthropomorphic hedgehog, who has the . ability to run at supersonic speeds as well as curl into a ball, . primarily to attack enemies. Throughout the course of the many video games, . Sonic most commonly has to race through levels, collect power up rings . and survive against a host of natural obstacles and robotic evil minions to achieve . his goal. The video by Machinima, a gaming news channel on YouTube, takes gamers on a familiar journey through the first mini level that they have probably played many times but with a new viewpoint. While fans of the platform game might risk motion sickness watching the video, they can avoid vicious robots and dodge sharp-toothed jumping fish, while riding out the bumps and clambering over the rocks that litter the course in the first mini level - all through the eyes of the spiny blue mammal. The really nauseating moments of the video come when Sonic bounces on platforms to leap over fierce metal spikes and negotiates the loop-the-loop tracks. And that's before the soul-destroying moment familiar to many children of the nineties when the hapless hedgehog loses all the rings just before completing the stage. However, a stomach-churning video now lets nostalgic gamers see the first Sonic game as they never have before as they race along and dodge obstacles as 'the blue blur'. A Slightly later game title is pictured . While fans of the 'the blue blur' will have played games on later consoles where they follow the hedgehog or share Sonic's viewpoint, this is the first time gamers have got a hog's-eye-view on the very first major game he was featured in. Sonic was a huge gaming icon of the nineties and featured in numerous spin-off comics, four animated shows as well as on countless pieces of merchandise. The first game,on which this video is based, was released on 23 June 1991 and the character was created for Sega so that the Japanese gaming company had a mascot to rival Nintendo's Mario.

But Tamera's former Silver Roc bandmember Jerrie Dila, 22, who she was split up from at the first round of auditions didn't fare as well, and was sent home by the panel after failing to impress with her rendition of Rihanna's We Found Love. Tamera's drugs scandal is the first major controversy to hit this year's X Factor when it emerged on Sunday that she had boasted online about smoking marijuana. Controversy: Tamera Foster tweeted about smoking marijuana and has now been spoken to by X Factor bosses . The 16-year-old posted pictures of what appeared to be an unlit cannabis joint and tweeted about the effect of smoking 'Zoom' - marijuana coated in the class-A drug PCP. In one tweet she wrote: 'Woiiii I just woke up :O that zoom last night put me to sleeeeeep garddd.' In another she wrote: 'Time to fly high with my sis @LivvsParkerx'. Under the picture on her Twitter account she made several references to 'Mary Jane' - slang for cannabis. X Factor chiefs have spoken to her and she is understood to be 'mortified'. Her account has now been suspended. Tamera, from Gravesend, Kent, has been tipped to be a major star with judge Gary Barlow telling her on Saturday's show: 'You have potential beyond belief'. A programme spokesman told the Sunday Mirror: 'The X Factor does not condone the use of drugs in any way and appropriate action will be taken against anyone found to be taking drugs while under our care.' Boasting: Tweet from Tamera Foster on her Twitter account which has been suspended following the controversy over her bragging about drugs . Tweet from X Factor singer Tamera Foster which showed what appeared to be an unlit joint . On January 13, Tamera reposted the picture of the 'joint' on her Twitter account - @DiorTee - with the words: 'This would please me right now.' Tipped for stardom: Tamera Foster has been given a talking to by show bosses for bragging about smoking marijuana . The newspaper reported she posted another picture of herself with a friend pointing out the effects marijuana can have, writing: 'Flying high with my homie Presh. Just look at my eyes mate.' In another tweet, she wrote: 'Riding that morning wave with @LivvsParker x & The Sweet Mary Jane. Previously she had written: 'Inhale that good s*** exhale the bulls***.' An X Factor source told the Sunday Mirror that Tamera had been 'spoken to' but because she was young that did not want to be too hard on her and 'ruin' her chances. A show insider told MailOnline: 'She was 15 when she posted those comments. She was very young and naive. She just mad a big mistake and now wants to move on.' Twitter followers have claimed the account isn't Tamera's but although she stopped using it months ago, it was still 'live'. She had originally auditioned in Cardiff with 22-year-old Jerrie Diller as part of a duo Silver Rock. But the judges though they lacked chemistry and asked them to sing separately. Drug scandals have twice rocked X Factor in the past with Frankie Cocozza being kicked off the show in 2011 for using cocaine, while Wagner faced the axe in 2010 for buying cannabis inside the TV studios.

A national champion athlete, who became obese after a knee injury ended her career, has managed to lose almost half her body weight with the help of the TV series Extreme Weight Loss. Cassandra Dumas, 45, from California, explained during last night's episode that a divorce also added to her problems and decades of comfort eating saw her tip the scales at 364pounds. 'No one would ever guess that this body is a national champion. I let my body get this way, I got out of control,' the former discus and shot put star said, adding that she'd also turned into a recluse. Getting in shape: Former champion athlete, Cassandra Dumas, who became obese after a knee injury ended her career, has managed to shed almost half her body weight with the help of ABC's Extreme Weight Loss . Video source ABC . 'I don’t venture out like I used to. I come home and I cook dinner. Generally I don't eat at the dining room table, I usually fix my plate and I come to my bedroom. I didn’t think I’d be in this situation.' In a bid to get into shape she sent a letter to Chris Powell, Extreme Weight Loss' fitness trainer, asking for his help. After being accepted on to the show, she was given one year to turn her life around and ditch her unhealthy habits. Flashback: Ms Dumas demonstrates her shot put skills in a magazine - she was forced to give up her sporting career after a knee injury . From sports star to stationary: When Ms Dumas went off to college she stopped sports all together and the weight gradually piled on . Mr Powell encouraged her to take up exercise again, instead of sitting fixed to the TV and computer screen. 'I've always felt I could do anything I put my mind to, but I've always put others first. This year, I'm putting myself first' He also sent her to a nutritionist to get advice on meal plans. Apparently condiments were one of her guilty pleasures, and she would put spoonfuls of mayonnaise or ketchup on her dinners adding up to 400 calories each time. Giving her greater impetus to slim down a full medical examination revealed that she suffered from  sleep apnea. Unhealthy habits: Old pictures show how the former athlete's body ballooned during her twenties . The disorder, characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep, can cause fatigue and increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, obesity, and diabetes. 'I don't venture out like I used to. I come home and I cook dinner. I didn't think I'd be in this situation' 'I let my body get this way . . .  and I’m going to fix this,' Ms Dumas said determinedly. Asked where she would like to be in one year, she told Mr Powell: 'I want to lose weight and I want to eventually meet the person I’ll spend a lifetime with.' She said that she never wanted to be a divorcee and looked to her parents' 50-year-marriage as inspiration. However, her past relationship was plagued by trust issues. Breaking a sweat: For the first time in years Ms Dumas started working out . Learning the ropes: Extreme Weight Loss fitness trainer Chris Powell showed her simple exercises she could do to get her fitness back on track . As the year went on the former athlete, who now works as a  high school guidance counselor, found that her confidence started to return. Instead of hiding away she tried speed dating and even went on a singles adventure trip. 'I’ve always felt I could do anything I put my mind to, but I’ve always put others first. This year, I’m putting myself first,' she said. While she experienced a few setbacks along the way, forcing Mr Powell to give her smaller weekly weight loss goals, Ms Dumas continued to push through. Helping hand: Mr Powell supported Ms Dumas throughout her journey and helped her keep on target . A new woman: Ms Dumas' weight came in at 189 pounds - she is now set for skin removal surgery . At her final weigh-in she stepped on to the scales in front of friends, family and her high school students. All sounded their amazement at her transformation. Ms Dumas' weight came in at 189 pounds. She is now set for surgery to take away five square feet of excess skin and 15 extra pounds of tissue from her body. She concluded: 'It was a year that made me refocus myself, to make my dreams come true, to realize that I’m unstoppable . . .

Styling: Pattern Maker Irena Stankevica tailors a top-end suit to fit Fanta the Dachshund . Wardrobe: The coutique offers a range of canine outfits from leather jackets to t-shirts and raincoats . Andrey Savin set up the business after finding his own three Dachshunds, Fanta, two, Sanvy, 18 months, and Michka, 12 months, needed coats to keep them warm. He has a boutique with a range of dogwear in varying sizes according to breed, as well as offering a made-to-measure service so that owners can create their pet's very own wardrobe from scratch. Andrey said: 'We used to live in Russia where it is very cold and my dogs needed to be clothed in winter. 'My family has a lot of dogs and we found this to be quite a problem in the cold months.

'My dog needs clothing, but I don't want people to laugh at her. Everything around is all themed or bright pink and never fits properly.'

Hidden away in the cloud forests of Colombia and described as half cat, half teddy bear, the olinguito is the first new carnivore to be discovered in the Western Hemisphere in 35 years. The cute creature has been wrongly identified for 100 years, despite having been spotted in the wild, tucked into museum collections and even exhibited in zoos. But now scientists at the Smithsonian Institute have confirmed the loveable carnivorous mammal is a new species and have said it is 'an incredibly rare discovery in the 21st Century'. Scroll down for video . Hidden away in the cloud forests of Colombia and described as half cat, half teddy bear, the olinguito is the first new carnivore to be discovered in the Western Hemisphere in 35 years . Researchers said that despite the animal's cat feline and bear-like appearance, the olinguito is actually a member of the Procyonidae family, along with raccoons, coatis, kinkajous and olingos. Weighing 2lb and with woolly orange brown fur, it lives in the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador but for more than a century it was mistaken for its larger close cousin, the olingo. An examination of the skull, teeth and skin of museum specimens has now confirmed that it is a different species - the first New World carnivore to be identified in 35 years. In a report on the discovery, U.S. scientists from the Smithsonion Institute in Washington DC described the creature's appearance as 'a cross between a house cat and a teddy bear'. Compared with the olingo, its teeth and skull are smaller and shaped differently and its orange-brown fur is longer and denser. 'The discovery of the olinguito shows us that the world is not yet completely explored, its most basic secrets not yet revealed,' said Dr Kristofer Helgen, curator of mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. Researchers say the olinguito looks like a cross between a house cat and a teddy bear but the furry animals is actually a member of the Procyonidae family, along with raccoons, coatis, kinkajous and olingos . 'If new carnivores can still be found, what other surprises await us? So many of the world's species are not yet known to science. 'Documenting them is the first step towards understanding the full richness and diversity of life on Earth.' The animal's scientific name is Bassaricyon neblina. Bassaricyon is a genus, or family, of tree-living carnivore that includes several different species, while nebina means 'fog' in Spanish. After identifying museum specimens, the researchers travelled to the northern Andes to see if any olinguitos remained in the wild. Records showed that the creature lived high in the mountains, at elevations of 5,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level and grainy footage from a camcorder video provided a lucky early lead. Eventually, the team discovered olinguitos living in an Ecuadorian forest and spent a number of days observing the creatures. They learned that the olinguito is mostly active at night, eats fruit as well as meat, rarely leaves the trees, and has one offspring at a time. Weighing two pounds and with wooly orange brown fur, the olinguito lives in the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador, as its scientific name 'neblina,' which is Spanish for fog, suggests. The creature is mostly active at night and eats mainly fruit despite being a carnivore but it rarely comes out of the trees . The animal's habitat is under heavy pressure from human development, said the scientists writing in the journal ZooKeys. An estimated 42 per cent of olinguito habitat has already been urbanised or converted to agriculture. At least one olinguito from Colombia was exhibited in several US zoos during the 1960s and 1970s, the researchers said. There were several occasions in the past century when the species came close to being unmasked. In 1920, a New York zoologist suggested that a museum specimen was unusual enough to be a new species, but never followed the suspicion up. Dr Helgen said: 'The cloud forests of the Andes are a world unto themselves, filled with many species found nowhere else, many of them threatened or endangered. 'We hope that the olinguito can serve as an ambassador species for the cloud forests of Ecuador and Colombia, to bring the world's attention to these critical habitats. 'This is a beautiful animal, but we know so little about it. How many countries does it live in? 'What else can we learn about its behaviour [and] what do we need to do to ensure its conservation?' For more than a century the oliguino was mistaken for its larger close cousin, the olingo (pictured).

The new $6.4billion eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge has been opened to traffic after years of delays and cost overruns, carrying its first drivers across the bay late Monday night just hours before the beginning of the work week. The reopening came after the California Highway Patrol conducted a final security check and toll takers resumed their positions following a five-day closure as crews completed striping, railing and other final details on the new gleaming white span. Cars began lining up hours earlier in an attempt to be among the first on the new span, and CHP officers led a line of drivers across at about 10:15 p.m., some seven hours before the 5 a.m. Tuesday reopening that was estimated before the closure.

Open road: Traffic flows across the new eastern span of the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge on Tuesday . At a modest inaugural ceremony, the new, self-anchored suspension bridge with its looming, single white tower was praised as a dramatic safety upgrade over its predecessor and a beautiful example of public art. 'I hope this is more than just connecting two land masses,' said Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. 'I hope that the progress that's being represented at this moment is for a generation to dream big dreams and to do big things.' Newsom, the former mayor of San Francisco, cut a chain with a blow torch to mark the opening after leading those gathered around the bridge's toll plaza in a countdown to the reopening. There was no public celebration with tens of thousands of pedestrians and fireworks as originally planned. Instead, after years of delays and cost overruns, the opening of one of the state's most expensive public works projects was marked with a relatively low-key event that did not even include the governor. The new span replaces a structure that . was damaged during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. It is designed to . withstand the strongest earthquake estimated by seismologists to occur . at the site over a 1,500-year period. The largest self-anchored suspension bridge in the world opened before Tuesday morning's rush hour across San Francisco Bay, six years behind schedule and five times over budget . The new eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay bridge is illuminated. The new section of bridge has been under construction for nearly 12 years and follows years of political bickering, engineering challenges and cost overruns . Vehicles drive on the new eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay bridge in San Francisco, California on September 2, 2013 . 'Despite the journey's length, it has been completed before the arrival of our next big earthquake,' said Steve Heminger, executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. 'And thank goodness for that.' Heminger was among numerous officials who spoke at the event, which included a poem about the bridge by California's poet laureate, Juan Felipe Herrera. '(This project) has at times inspired me, challenged me, frustrated me and today, after seeing the final product, it impresses me with its beauty, its grace and its strength,' said Brian Kelly, who heads the state's Business, Transportation & Housing Agency. Gov. Jerry Brown, who was closely . involved in planning the bridge when he was mayor of Oakland, was out of . town and unable to attend the ceremony, said his spokesman, Evan . Westrup. The entire . bridge closed Wednesday night so crews could do final work, and they . were still striping, putting up signs and putting down roadway markers . Monday, said bridge spokesman Andrew Gordon. Some barrier railing also . needed to be installed.

James Ghielmetti, a member of the California Transportation Commission, said at Monday's ceremony that the bridge should not have taken so long to go up. 'California must do a better job going forward on all of our public works projects,' he said. In March, more than two dozen rods used to anchor the roadway to important earthquake safety structures cracked after they were tightened. The discovery threatened to delay the bridge's opening by months. The bridge will open with a temporary fix for the broken rods while the permanent repair, expected to be completed in December, is being installed. Transportation officials approved the temporary fix last month and voted to open the bridge as originally planned around the Labor Day weekend. But Gordon said Monday that there was not enough time for a public celebration. Plans for such a celebration originally called for a bridge walk with more than 100,000 people, fireworks, a half marathon and a concert.","The $6.4 billion bridge is designed to withstand the strongest earthquake estimated by seismologists to occur at the site over a 1,500-year period .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:10 EST, 3 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:26 EST, 3 September 2013 . The American adoptive parents of Max Shatto, an orphan from Russia, spoke to the press for the first time since being cleared of any wrong-doing in his death. Max died last January at his new home in Gardendale, Texas after being left alone to play outside. His death became fodder for Russian politicians who deemed him the twenty-first Russian-born child to die at the hands of adoptive  American parents - thus cementing a recent ban on all U.S. adoptions in the country. Breaking their silence: The adoptive parents of Max Shatto, an orphan from Russia, gave their first interview since being cleared of any wrong-doing in his January death . Eight months after Max's death, Mr and Mrs Shatto gave their first interview with the New York Times. Mrs Shatto recalled the day she lost her newly-adopted son and the grief she's experienced since his passing. Laura and Alan Shatto adopted two half-brothers, 3-year-old Max and 2-year-old Kris, from Russia last November, after multiple failed fertility treatments and three miscarriages. The adoption process wasn't much easier. It cost them $31,000 to adopt one child, and an addition $12,000 for a sibling - not counting the travel for three required trips to Russia. But after meeting the two boys on their first trip, they knew it would all be worth it. Parents: Laura and Alan Shatto adopted Max and his younger half-brother Kris last November from an orphanage in Russia . Soon after they brought the two home, they started to notice that Max was hurting himself: picking at his skin, banging his head into the walls and hurling his body on the floor. At first, Mr Shatto thought Max's self-abuse might be an adjustment issue that would pass - but it only got worse. They pointed these problems out to Max's pediatrician who prescribed a medication usually given to autistic children, but they soon took him off it when he started acting 'like a zombie'. When they brought up Max's 'adjustment issues' to the child's adoption caseworkers, they told him he was too young for medication or therapy. 'They told us we need to love him more,' Mrs Shatto said. Signs of abuse: When coroners conducted an autopsy of the toddler they found signs of abuse - but have since ruled those bruises as self-inflicted . Playground accident: Coroners say Max died from internal bleeding most likely incurred from falling off the swing set . Seventy-nine days after they brought the two boys home, Mrs Shatto was watching them play outside when she had to use the bathroom, . She says she considered taking the boys inside, but figured that she would be quick and the area was fenced off anyway. When she went back outside she found Max on the ground and unresponsive. Blame: Mrs Shatto still wonders if she played a role in Max's death through the CPR process . She called 911 and they tried to walk her through the process of CPR. But once emergency responders arrived 22 minutes later, Max was pronounced dead. Mrs Shatto continues to be haunted by that day, and even questions whether or not she played a role in her son's death. 'I kept wondering: ‘Did I hurt my baby? Did I hurt my baby?’ Max's autopsy highlighted some signs of possible abuse - some 30 bruises and other marks on his body. And those signs of abuse led to outrage in Russia, which had just recently passed legislation outlawing U.S. adoptions of Russian orphans citing cases of abuse and neglect. After Max's death, protest broke out across the country condemning the Shattos, and calling for the return of Kris. But an investigation on the family in the U.S. has since determined that the wounds found on Max's body were self-inflicted and his death was caused by internal injuries most likely caused by a fall from the swing set. The couple were warned about the health issues adopted children in Russia often have, but they instantly well in love with the two kids. 'I saw them, and I just started crying,' Ms. Shatto said. 'When you’ve been waiting to be a mother for so long, well, they could have had horns and we were still going after them.' They were told that Max and Kris' shared mother, 24-year-old Yulia Kuzmina, may have been drinking during her pregnancies, but they didn't know the extent. Ms Kuzmina's father, a neighbor and local child welfare officials all attest that she was heavily drinking during her pregnancy with Max. After finding out that Max had died, Ms Kuzmina said she wanted to kill the Shattos and now she wants her surviving child back. 'I think they would have been better off with me,' she said. Better off? Max and Kris' biological mother Yulia Kuzmina - a noted alcoholic - has said that the boys would have been better off with her . Politicized: In Russia, people took to the streets to protest against U.S. adoptions of their orphans. Max's death only helped bolster the politicians case against foreign adoptions . Russian officials agree, and have been trying to cancel the Shatto's adoption of Kris. But the U.S. State Department has assured the couple that this wouldn't be possible. Though the couple have been cleared of any suspicion in Max's death, life hasn't gotten any easier since he passed. Mrs Shatto said shoppers have called her a murderer at the supermarket and some friends no longer visit or return phone calls. She's afraid to leave the house with Kris in case someone will call her a name in front of him or a Russian official will kidnap him. They still haven't explained Max's death to him. Kris hasn't asked about Max most likely because he's used to the other children coming and going in the orphanage. While Mrs Shatto will always be heartbroken at the loss of her child, she says she'd adopt him again if given the chance. 'He had issues but he had the sweetest personality. I mean, looking back, we would have still brought him home.' Worth it: If given the chance, Mrs Shatto said she would adopt Max again in a heartbeat .","Max Shatto died last January after his adoptive mother Laura Shatto left him outside to play alone while she went to the bathroom .

If so, you aren't alone as a new survey has found that more than half of British people 'drinkcessorise' or match their drink to their style. The study also found that some drinks are considered more stylish than others, with cocktails, wine and cider topping the cool chart while lager and beer languish at the bottom. What's more, revealed the survey, your choice of tipple can even have an impact on how attractive you are to the opposite sex, with the majority of respondents saying that your favourite drink speaks volumes about your personality. Looking good: The research found that more than half of British people match their tipple to their style . Londoners were the most likely to judge attractiveness based on tipple tastes, with over half (52 per cent) of those in the capital saying that drink choice helps to make someone appear more attractive. Stylist, Alexxia Elizabeth commented: 'Of course people match their drinks with their style, it’s one of those unspoken rules of the pub. Cocktails such as the Cosmopolitan are perceived as being a cooler drink than beer and lager . 'If you’re in a summery beer garden you might go for a floral print with biker boots to add some edge and in that case a blush pink drink can not only complement your outfit colour-wise, but it can also help you carry off the overall mood and style you’re going for. 'Choosing a clashing drink, or something that just isn’t sexy, can ruin a whole look.' Surprisingly, the study, which was carried out by Koppaberg cider, also found that men are slightly more likely to 'drincessorise' than women. More than half of men admit to matching their drink to their look, compared with just 47 per cent of women. A spokesperson for the brand said: 'I think the major influence on what people drink is whether they like it or not, but it’s interesting to see just how important it is to match your style of drink with your overall style. 'Since we launched Kopparberg in the UK, the brand has carried on the Swedish tradition for great design, as has our glassware, which is perhaps why we are seeing a lot of people characterising it as stylish and matching it with their look.'

And, with a heady blend of the world's most attractive people in the mix, there aren't many real people out there who will make the grade. The perfect social networking profile picture for women to attract men must have a blend of the features of Kelly Brook, Mila Kunis and Scarlett Johansson, researchers say. Men, meanwhile, are most likely to tempt . women with a photo that is a composite of David Beckham, Jonny Depp and . Ryan Gosling. Is this the perfect social networking profile picture for women to attract men: a mix of celebrity beauties Kelly Brook, Mila Kunis and Scarlett Johansson . Brunette beauties Kelly Brook and Mila Kunis have the body and facial features, respectively, to make up the perfect profile picture . It is hardly surprising that Scarlett Johansson's eyes were deemed the most likely to attract a man . The news comes as over half of British social network users admit enhancing their online identity to appeal to potential partners - and one in five confesses they have created an entirely fake profile. Women want their ideal partner to be dark, handsome, romantic, humorous, sporty and well-travelled, researchers from entertainment channel MTV found. Their perfect profile photofit has Jonny Depp's hair; Ryan Gosling's eyes and David Beckham's jawline. Men are after a busty, curvy woman who is also clever and into keeping fit, movies and eating out. Their dream profile picture has Kelly Brook's body; Scarlett Johansson's eyes and the facial features of Mila Kunis. We are a nation of digital daredevils with 90 per cent of social media users having accepted an invitation to connect online with a complete stranger. If you are looking for love online, you should show a little cleavage in your profile picture as well as listing your favorite food and films . Nearly half have gone on to meet in person someone they first encountered online - and one in eight has started a sexual relationship with them. Attractiveness emerged as the number one reason for accepting a stranger as a 'friend' via social media. We apparently notice eyes, smiles and hair first when looking at a profile picture. But over a quarter of men are most attracted to female profiles where breasts or bottoms feature prominently. The most attractive personality traits are intelligence, confidence and sense of humour and most enticing interests are travel, cooking and dining, music and sport. In a bid to impress the opposite sex, over half of Brits have photoshopped pictures of themselves or lied about their age, height, weight, job, achievements or reason for their last break-up. And a quarter have pretended to be someone else on a social networking site. The perfect attractive profile picture: A mix of celebrity hunks David Beckham, Jonny Depp and Ryan Gosling has been created by top artists after a survey of 2,400 people . Based on the findings, men hoping to meet a partner would do well to pepper their profile pages with shots of them playing rugby, travelling to romantic locations like Paris as well as sharing witty jokes and quotations. Women wanting to find love online should share sexy shots of themselves sunbathing or working out as well as listing their favourite food and films. The survey of 2,400 people, who were shown images of celebrities, was carried out to mark the start of the second series of MTV show Catfish. A 'catfish' is a person who pretends to be someone they are not, particularly to pursue deceitful online romances. Men in the market for love should include shots of themselves playing rugby nad travelling to romantic locations like Paris in their profile, as well as sharing witty jokes and quotations . David Beckham's jaw line and Ryan Gosling's eyes help to make up the perfect profile picture for a man looking to attract the opposite sex . The show sees the real people behind fake social media profiles unmasked. MTV spokeswoman Jo Bacon commented: 'Most of us dream about being added by a Mila Kunis or David Beckham lookalike online whilst dreamy eyes, a killer smile and a decent bum all get our pulses racing when we look at a social media profile we don't know. 'But do we really know who is on the other side of the profile? 'These amazing figures show social media users up and down the country would be more than happy to connect, form a relationship and even consider sex with someone they don't know, especially if they find their profile attractive. 'However, what we want to highlight is that the person you are conversing with might not be quite what you expect with as many as one in five of us actively using and creating false profiles.'","The 'perfect' profile snap has Mila's facial features and Scarlett's eyes .

Keen runners and sports enthusiasts regularly spend vast sums of money on hi-tech footwear that promises to boost performance and prevent injury. But new research shows that the such shoes could be less necessary than thought. Experts have discovered that human feet have evolved surprisingly little since over thousands of years and that we share striking similarities with our tree-dwelling cousins, who are known to have flexible, resilient feet - and who do not wear shoes at all. Experts have discovered that human feet have evolved little over thousands of years and that there are surprisingly similarities between those belonging to us and chimpanzees (right) In great apes, the mid-foot is fully flexible and makes regular contact with the ground. It has long been thought that human feet, more adapted to walking, are markedly different. Indeed there is now a whole industry that warns that sport shoes and inserts are essential to keep the human arch stiffly supported to ensure no damage is done. But Robin Huw Crompton, a physical anthropologist at the University of Liverpool's Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, said his findings suggest the outer arch of the healthy human foot is actually much more flexible than previously thought. 'The idea before was that if this arch wasn't stiff, it probably required treatment. But based on what we found, I don't think that's true,' he told NPR. Scientists studied more than 25,000 . steps made by volunteers on a pressure-sensitive treadmill to . investigate how evolution has shaped the human foot. The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, showed this was not so. The study suggests that perhaps specialist footwear isn't as crucial as previously thought . Two thirds of normal healthy volunteers produced footfalls where the mid-foot touched the ground - something previously believed to characterise diabetes or arthritis, both of which can alter foot structure. Study leader Dr Karl Bates, from the University of Liverpool's Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, said: 'Our ancestors probably first developed flexibility in their feet when they were primarily tree-dwelling, and moving on bendy branches, but as time passed and we became more and more ground-dwelling animals, some new features evolved to enable us to move quickly on the ground. 'Our limbs, however, did not adapt to life on the ground anywhere near as much as those of other ground-dwelling animals such as horses, hares and dogs. 'Our tests showed that our feet are not as stiff as originally thought and actually form part of a continuum of variation with those of other great apes. 'We hypothesise that despite becoming nearly exclusively ground dwelling we have retained flexibility in the feet to allow us to cope effectively with the differences in hard and soft ground surfaces which we encounter in long distance walking and running. 'The next part of our study will be testing this theory, which could offer a reason why humans can outrun a horse, for example, over long distances on irregular terrain.'","University of Liverpool's Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease found that our feet have evolved very little and are similar to urangutangs .

US General Joseph Dunford said 'time's . going to tell' whether it was premature for Nato to end combat . operations this spring . Western troops are likely to remain in Afghanistan beyond 2015 in order to help develop the Afghan air force and intelligence capability, a Nato commander has said. Some 1,792 Afghan police officers have been . killed since March – twice as many as the same period last year, . according to the Afghan interior ministry, leading to claims that the country is in no fit state to be left without Western combat troops as they prepare to exit this spring. US General Joseph Dunford said 'time's . going to tell' whether it was premature for Nato to end combat . operations this spring and said the follow-on mission focusing on 'capability development' is likely to last several years. In reference to the casualty rates, he said: ‘I view it as serious, and so do all the commanders,’ he said. ‘I’m not assuming that those casualties are sustainable.’ Gen Dunford said the 350,000 local security forces struggled with both intelligence-gathering and logistics and needed ‘three to five years’ before they no longer needed help from foreign troops. By the end of 2014, Afghans are expected to take full responsibility for their security, and all combat Nato troops will leave.  In August President Obama promised this would signal 'the end of our war in Afghanistan.' He said 'close air support' may still be needed to assist Afghan security forces, which are only just beginning to develop their own aviation capacity.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . PUBLISHED: . 05:46 EST, 2 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:16 EST, 2 September 2013 . The Curiosity rover has turned its cameras on Mars' moon, Phobos, to capture the most detailed image of any Martian lunar transit ever taken. The larger of Mars’ two moons, Phobos, passed directly in front of the sun on the 369th Martian day of Curiosity's work on the planet. Phobos does not fully cover the sun, as seen from the surface of Mars, so the solar eclipse is what’s called a ring, or annular, type. Scroll down for video... This set of three images shows views three seconds apart as the larger of Mars' two moons, Phobos, passed directly in front of the sun. Curiosity photographed this annular, or ring, eclipse with the telephoto-lens camera of the rover's Mast Camera on the 369th Martian day of Curiosity's work on Mars . The pictures of the eclipse were taken three seconds apart with the rover’s telephoto lens. The rover's observations of Phobos will help make researchers' knowledge of the moon's orbit even more precise. Because the eclipse occurred near mid-day at Curiosity's location on Mars, Phobos was nearly overhead, closer to the rover than it would have been earlier in the morning or later in the afternoon. This timing made Phobos' silhouette larger against the sun- as close to a total eclipse of the sun as is possible from Mars. ‘This event occurred near noon at . Curiosity's location, which put Phobos at its closest point to the . rover, appearing larger against the sun than it would at other times of . day,’ said Mark Lemmon a . co-investigator for use of Curiosity's Mastcam. Nasa's Mars Science Laboratory project is using Curiosity (a computer-generated illustration is pictured) landed on Mars in August last year for a two-year mission to determine if the planet most like Earth in the solar system has, or ever had, the an environment to sustain life . According to the Nasa, the position of Phobos crossing the sun was a mile or two closer to the centre of the sun's position than researchers anticipated. Phobos has a diameter of less than one per cent of the Earth's moon and it orbits much closer to Mars than our moon's distance from Earth. The larger of Mars' moons measures just 22km in diameter but orbits just 3,700 miles from Mars' surface. Phobos is the larger of Mars' two moons and  just 22km in diameter but orbits just 3,700 miles from Mars' surface. It is so close to the planet's surface that in some locations on Mars it cannot always be seen. Phobos is nearing Mars at a rate of 1.8 m every hundred years; at that rate, it will either crash into Mars in 50 million years or break up into a ring. Its most prominent feature is the 6-mile crater Stickney, its impact causing streak patterns across the moon's surface. When viewed from the surface of Mars, Phobos looks about half as wide the Earth's moon appears to viewers on Earth, according to the scientists. The Earth's moon is vast compared to the Martian moons, with a diameter of around 2,160 miles but orbits much further away from it's planet's surface at an average of 239,000 miles. The rover landed on Mars in August last year for a two-year mission to determine if the planet most like Earth in the solar system has, or ever had, the an environment to sustain life. Curiosity is now trundling along to its final destination - Mount Sharp - where it will look at the lower layers of the mountain that towers over the centre of Gale Crater by almost three and a half miles. Mount Sharp is of interest to scientists because its layers of rock can reveal information about the planet's changing environment over time. Last month, Curiosity captured the eclipse of the moons - Phobos and Deimos - for the first time from Mars. The larger moon, Phobos, passed in front of Deimos in the 30-second video comprised of 41 images taken by the robotic vehicle that were stitched together by scientists working at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.","Phobos passed directly in front of the sun on Curiosity's 369th Martian day .

It has witnessed major weather events from hurricane Katrina in 2005 to icy Christmas blizzards that crippled the U.S. in 2009. But the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 12 has finally stopped recording the weather patterns of the East Coast of the U.S. - after 3,788 days. To honour the decommissioning of the weather satellite, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S. has created a time-lapse video of all the weather events GOES-12 has witnessed in the last decade. Scroll down for video . Geostationary satellite GOES-12 captured this visible image of Hurricane Katrina on August 28, 2005. At that time, the storm was at Category 5 strength and projected to impact New Orleans . Due to thruster control issues, the satellite drifted south of the equator to spend its last three years studying the weather of South America, although it still managed to provide images of hurricane Sandy in October 2012. Launched in July 2001, the satellite lasted well beyond its . original operational design life of two years for on-orbit storage and . five years of actual operations to support forecasters and scientists in . NOAA’s National Weather Service, according to the organisisation. 'GOES-12 gave the Western Hemisphere many years of reliable data as the operational eastern GOES for accurate forecasts, from small storms to those of historic proportions,' said Mary Kicza, assistant administrator for NOAA’s Satellite and Information Service. The satellite started its service by monitoring weather across the U.S. East Coast and part of the Atlantic Ocean. In January 2010 GOES-12 captured a . powerful storm developing in the U.S. mid-west and in the coming days, two . blizzards hit the East Coast resulting in historic snowfall totals. In May 2010, when the geostationary satellite was no longer able to be maintained to meet the requirements of the National Weather Service, it was shifted to a new position, where it provided coverage of weather conditions affecting South America, including volcanic ash clouds, wildfires, and drought. To decommission GOES-12, the NOAA boosted the satellite further into orbit using its remaining fuel, before turning off the battery and transmitters. This manoeuvre was designed to reduce the chances of the satellite colliding with other operational spacecraft as well as lowering the risk of orbital debris and preventing the satellite from transmitting any signals that could interfere with any current or future spacecraft. On January 29, 2010, GOES-12 captured a powerful storm developing in the U.S. mid-west. In the coming days, two blizzards hit the East Coast resulting in historic snowfall totals. Engineers work on the GOES-M (GOES-12) satellite before launch. It provided weather imagery to support weather forecasting and severe storm tracking for the East Coast of the U.S for ten years . While GOES-12 is now silent, GOES-13, . which serves as the GOES East satellite for the U.S. and GOES-15, which . covers the West Coast, are both hovering 22,300 miles above the equator. Another back-up satellite, GOES-14, can be activated if the others fail. Ms Kicza said: 'The NOAA-NASA partnership is making steady progress toward developing and launching the more advanced GOES-R satellite series to position us into the future.' This satellite is expected to more than double the clarity of today’s . GOES imagery and provide more atmospheric observations by sending more images more frequently. Data from the GOES-R instruments will be used to create different products that will help meteorologists monitor the atmosphere, land, ocean and the sun. The satellites will also carry a new 'geostationary lightning mapper' that will provide a continuous surveillance of total lightning activity throughout the Americas and adjacent oceans for the first time, according to the NOAA. The organisation seeks to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment, from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun.","The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has released a video to mark ten years of service by the GOES-12 satellite .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 00:34 EST, 2 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:38 EST, 2 September 2013 . The National Security Agency's spy program targeted the communications of the Brazilian and Mexican presidents, and in the case of Mexico's leader accessed the content of emails before he was elected, the U.S. journalist who obtained secret documents from NSA leaker Edward Snowden said Sunday. Journalist Glenn Greenwald, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, told Globo's news program 'Fantastico' that a document dated June 2012 shows that Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's emails were being read. The document's date is a month before Pena Nieto was elected. The document on which Greenwald based the report includes communications from Pena Nieto indicating who he would like to name to some government posts among other information. It's not clear if the spying continues. Hacked: The emails of Enrique Pena Nieto, the President of Mexico were apparently looked at by the NSA . Listening in: Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff's emails and online chats were also monitored according to the latest documents . Whistle-blower: The new documents are just the latest in a series of leaks by former NSA analyst Edward Snowden . As for Brazil's leader, the June 2012 document 'doesn't include any of Dilma's specific intercepted messages, the way it does for Nieto,' Greenwald told The Associated Press in an email. 'But it is clear in several ways that her communications were intercepted, including the use of DNI Presenter, which is a program used by NSA to open and read emails and online chats.' The U.S. targeting mapped out the aides with whom Rousseff communicated and went a level further by tracking patterns of how those aides communicated with one another and also third parties, according to the document. Calls to Rousseff's office and a spokeswoman were not answered. Messages sent to a spokesman for Nena Pieto weren't immediately returned. Mexico's Foreign Ministry said had no comment. Brazilian Justice Minister Eduardo Cardozo told the newspaper O Globo that 'if the facts of the report are confirmed, they would be considered very serious and would constitute a clear violation of Brazil's sovereignty.' Making waves: The latest revelations were revealed by Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald interviewed on a Brazilian news program . 'This is completely outside the standard of confidence expected of a strategic partnership, as the U.S. and Brazil have,' he added. In July, Greenwald co-wrote articles in O Globo that said documents leaked by Snowden indicate Brazil was the largest target in Latin America for the NSA program, which collected data on billions of emails and calls flowing through Brazil. The Brazilian government denounced the NSA activities outlined in the earlier reports. Greenwald reported then that the NSA collected the data through an undefined association between U.S. and Brazilian telecommunications companies. He said he could not verify which Brazilian companies were involved or if they were aware their links were being used to collect the data. Greenwald began writing stories based on material leaked by Snowden in May, mostly for the Guardian newspaper in Britain. Before news of the NSA program broke, the White House announced that Rousseff would be honored with a state dinner in October during a trip to the U.S., the only such full state dinner scheduled this year for a foreign leader. The move highlighted the U.S. desire to build on improved relations since Rousseff took the presidency on Jan. 1, 2011. Rousseff's office said last week that there were no plans to scrap the state dinner because of the NSA program. Detained: Last month, British authorities used anti-terrorism powers yesterday to detain Mr Miranda, the partner of Mr Greenwald, who has close links to Edward Snowden . Outrage: Journalist Glenn Greenwald said that the detaining of his partner at London Heathrow Airport was an attempt to 'intimidate' following his reporting of Edward Snowden's NSA leaks . The latest revelations were sure to increase tensions, coming on the heels of last month's detention of Greenwald's domestic partner, Brazilian citizen David Miranda, who was held for nearly nine hours at London's Heathrow airport. British authorities stopped him as he was transiting through the airport, citing their ability to do so under anti-terrorism legislation. The U.S. government was notified beforehand that Miranda was to be stopped as he returned home to Brazil after visiting Germany, where he met with Laura Poitras, a U.S. filmmaker who works with Greenwald on the NSA stories. Miranda had some of the pair's NSA documents leaked by Snowden on memory disks. Last week, senior British national security adviser Oliver Robbins offered a sweeping view of the government concerns about those documents before Britain's High Court, saying the 58,000 classified British documents were ""highly likely"" to describe techniques used in counter-terrorism operations and could reveal the identities of British intelligence officers abroad. Guardian Editor-in-Chief Alan Rusbridger dismissed the statement as containing 'unsubstantiated and inaccurate claims,' and questioned the danger, arguing that the government had done little to address the issue before Miranda's detention. After Miranda's detention, Greenwald promised he was going 'to write much more aggressively than before' about government snooping .","More secret documents released from NSA leaker Edward Snowden .

University of South Florida researchers began exhuming dozens of graves Saturday at a former Panhandle reform school in hopes of identifying the boys buried there and learning how they died. University spokeswoman Lara Wade said in a message Saturday that the work had begun at the site of the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys. Researchers are removing dirt with trowels and by hand to find the remains believed to be between about 19 inches to a little more than three feet under the surface.

University of South Florida researchers began exhuming dozens of graves Saturday . The Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys is pictured in 1936. The white building in the background is allegedly where abuse took place . Former inmates at the reform school from the 1950s and 1960s have detailed horrific beatings that took place in a small, white concrete block building at the facility. A group of survivors call themselves the 'White House Boys' and five years ago called for an investigation into the graves. In 2010, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement ended an investigation and said it could not substantiate or refute claims that boys died at the hands of staff. USF later began its own research and discovered even more graves than the state department had identified. USF has worked for months to secure a permit to exhume the remains, finally receiving permission from Gov. Rick Scott and the state Cabinet after being rejected by Secretary of State Ken Detzner, who reports to Scott. Robert Straley, a spokesman for the White House Boys, said the school segregated white and black inmates and that the remains are located where black inmates were held. He suspects there is another white cemetery that hasn’t been discovered. 'I think that there are at least 100 more bodies up there,' he said. 'At some point they are going to find more bodies, I’m dead certain of that. There has to be a white graveyard on the white side.' The main hallway of a building at the now-closed Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys known as 'The White House.' Many men who were kept at the school as children have said that they were horribly beaten in this building . University of South Florida Assistant Professor of Anthropology Erin Kimmerle tours the 'White House' Among those that have pushed to allow USF to conduct the research are Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi and Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. 'My goal all along has been to help bring closure to the families who lost loved ones at Dozier. I feel great relief that the work to identify human remains is now underway,' Bondi said through a spokeswoman. USF will work at the site until Tuesday and hopes to unearth the remains of two to four boys before resuming the excavation at a later date, Kimmerle said. The initial work will ensure that the process works smoothly before researchers return to the site. DNA obtained at the site will be sent to the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification for analysis. The hope is that it can be matched to relatives. Ten families have contacted researchers in hopes of identifying relatives that might be buried at Dozier. Survey flags left by University of South Florida researchers are pictured at the cemetery. Investigators used ground-penetrating radar and soil samples to find at least 50 graves on the grounds . If matches are found, remains will be returned to the families. 'They want to bury them in family plots and next to the boys’ mothers and things like that,' Kimmerle said. 'Anyone whose remains are unidentified will be re-interned here at Boot Hill.' Any remains that are re-interned will have a grave marker and their DNA will be recorded in case anyone other families seek to identify remains. 'Hopefully a lot of questions will soon be answered once the scientists finish unearthing these unmarked graves in ""Boot Hill Cemetery,""' Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin wrote in an email.","Researchers began exhuming dozens of graves Saturday at the site of the former Arthur G.

A spurned lover who doused his ex-girlfriend in petrol and set her on fire when she dumped him has been jailed for 19 years. Damion Sheldon, 42, of Dudley, West Midlands, attacked Louise Pilkington, 32, after struggling to cope after their nine-month relationship ended. The arsonist went to her home in nearby Rowley Regis in the early hours and poured petrol through the letterbox before covering her in the fuel and setting it alight - in front of a nine year old girl. Damion Sheldon (left) who doused his ex-girlfriend Louise Pilkington (right) in petrol and set fire to her as a nine-year-old child watched . Sheldon then walked off as flames ripped through the house - while a sleeping 13-month-old baby was in the house. Police reported the baby momentarily died from smoke inhalation before being resuscitated by firemen. A court heard he set her on fire in scenes described by neighbours as like 'something from a film' on December 2 last year. Witnesses told police they even heard Louise’s skin sizzle as they tried to put out the flames which engulfed her head and body. Blaze: The charred door of the house in the aftermath of the arson . Sheldon was unable to come to terms with his partner jilting him, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard during a week-long trial. He texted her and said 'thanks love. You have destroyed me,' before taking his revenge, it was said. Prosecutor Hugh O'Brien-Quinn said during the trial Sheldon was 'consumed by anger and self-pity' because he could not accept the relationship was over. The court heard the nine year old girl sprang into action and got Ms Pilkington to drop to the ground and roll while as she became a human fireball. She also tried to remove her burning clothes and watched in horror as flames tore through the house. Detective Constable Andy Barnsley, who investigated the case for West Midlands Police, said: 'This was a horrific crime committed out of pure malice at having been jilted by his partner. 'It is a measure of Sheldon's character that he went to set fire to his ex-partner's home in the dead of night and, when disturbed by the woman, he doused her in petrol and set fire to her in front of a young child. 'But this horror wasn't enough for Sheldon who then coolly walked into the house and set fire to the family home where a baby was sleeping. 'Like a coward he then ran off in an attempt to evade justice and when captured, tried to deny any knowledge of the offence blaming his actions on alcohol. 'It is thanks to the woman's quick thinking, the girl's help and the actions of neighbours and the emergency services that this was prevented from becoming a tragedy. 'I am satisfied that the courts realised . the sickening nature of Sheldon's crime and have handed down a fitting . sentence. I am certain that this will come as some comfort to all those . affected by the fire.' The smoke-stained room of the baby, which had to be resuscitated by firefighters . Witnesses told police they even heard Louise's skin sizzle as she tried to put out the flames which engulfed her head and body . Sheldon had been making threatening calls to Ms Pilkington from 7.26am on December 1 which became more menacing as he got drunk. He claimed during his trial he planned to kill himself that day but instead executed his catastrophic plan. Ms Pilkington screamed out to neighbours that a baby was in the blazing building and urged them to focus their efforts on rescuing the tot inside, who was being choked to death by the deadly fumes. Three men managed to smash their way through the window with a sledgehammer before firefighters battled their way into the property and rescued the child. The baby was rushed out of the house and passed to other firemen who performed CPR for five minutes and brought the child back to life. Louise has recovered 'remarkably' well from 16 per cent burns to her face and body, the trial was told.","Damion Sheldon poured petrol over Louise Pilkington and set her alight .

The 20-year-old New Hampshire coed who died from an overdose at a New York City dance music festival Saturday told paramedics she'd taken a dangerous club drug just moments before collapsing. 'I just took six hits of Molly,' Olivia Rotondo told EMS workers before she was rushed to the hospital. The college junior was one of two twenty-somethings who died of an overdose of Molly, the street name for MDMA, that day at the Electric Zoo music festival. Four other party-goers were also sickened and were hospitalized in critical condition. 'I just took six hits of Molly': 20-year-old Olivia Rotondo (right) died Saturday after suffering a seizure in front of paramedics at the Electric Zoo music festival in New York City . According to the New York Daily News, Rotondo also suffered a seizure as she collapsed in front of paramedics. The festival was scheduled to last through Sunday, but its third day of trance music and dancing was cancelled in light of the tragic deaths. Rotondo, a Providence, Rhode Island native, died at the hospital Saturday night. Jeffrey . Russ, 23, from Rochester, New York, also died from an overdose Saturday. Police . believe all six attendees either overdosed or took tainted doses of the . party drug Molly - a potent powder form of MDMA, aka Ecstasy.

Tragedy at dance festival: Olivia Rotondo, 20, from Providence, Rhode Island passed away after attending Electric Zoo shortly after Jeffrey Russ from Rochester, NY . 'Just get me to the damn zoo,' Rotondo tweeted hours before her death . In the aftermath of two deaths at New York City's Electric Zoo and and at least three overdoses in Massachusetts, DEA officials say the drug known as Molly, MDMA, or Ecstacy is a top priority. 'There’s no ‘good batch’ of molly,' Anthony Pettigrew, a spokesman for the DEA New England division, told the Boston Herald. 'This is stuff that’s made in somebody’s bathtub in either Asia, the Netherlands, Canada, you have no idea what is in this stuff. Dealers want to make more money, so they’ll mix and adulterate the stuff with meth and any number of other drugs to addict people to it.' An official with the New York arm of the Drug Enforcement Agency concurred. 'We are seeing (molly) goes hand-in-hand with a lot of nightclub activity, concert venues, areas where there’s a lot of teens listening to music,' said Erin Mulvey. 'With these overdose deaths and the focus now with trying to get the awareness out, we’re trying to get in front of the problem.' More dangerous? Molly has been known for years as MDMA or Ecstasy, but some say its powder form is more dangerous because it is easily adulterated when put inside capsules . Last Tuesday, 19-year-old Brittany Flannigan died in Boston after taking the drug Molly. OLD DRUG, NEW TRICKS? Molly is a crystalline or powder form of the well-known club drug Ecstasy. However, some believe Molly--which can be snorted or swallowed in a capsule--is more likely than the drug in tablet form to be laced with anything from caffeine to methamphetamine. The moniker 'Molly' could also refer to the chemical MDMA (ecstasy) or to a variety of similar and related chemicals. The drug is popular at music and dance venues because of its ability to energize its user. Users also report a sense of heightened empathy and of a heightened ability to 'feel' the music. It is nearly impossible for a user to judge exactly how much Molly they can safely take because there is no set measure of potency and it is often impossible to tell if a dose has been adulterated.

A candid letter revealing the Royal Family’s bitter resentment towards Edward VIII following his controversial abdication has come to light. The letter from Edward to aristocrat friend Lord Beaverbrook was penned in 1939, three years after he stepped down as King in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. The three-page missive reveals he was warned by the Royal Family stay away from England while his brother Albert established himself as the new King. A letter from the exiled Edward VIII finally lifts the lid on the bitter feelings within the Royal Family over his marriage to American divorcee Wallis Simpson . Albert, who took the name King George VI, famously struggled to adapt to the unwanted role and suffered from a severe stammer which impeded his public speaking. Edward, writing from exile in France in 1939, says he only went along with the warning to prevent enraging his mother, Queen Mary, and his sister-in-law Queen Elizabeth. He also brands the Royal Family’s decision to strip Simpson, officially the Duchess of Windsor, of the title ‘Royal Highness’ an 'insult'. Royal experts say the letter is a demonstration of the monarchy flexing its muscles over Edward and shows that the rift in the family lasted for a long time after the crisis. The three-page missive reveals he was warned by the Royal Family to stay away from England while his brother Albert established himself as the new King . The letter, which Edwards stated was ‘highly confidential’, reads: 'Of course you know as well as I do, that it is for no other reason than for fear lest the attitude my mother and sister in law seem likely to adopt towards my wife may provoke controversy in England and adverse criticism in America, that I have been advised to postpone our projected visit to England this Spring, until after the King’s and Queen’s official journey to Canada and the United States. 'In accordance with the policy of playing my brother’s game, I have agreed to another postponement, but, believe me, for the last time.' Edward reveals his exile from England was all but forced upon him and his new wife in the aftermath of the abdication scandal. The letter continues: 'While the Duchess and I have received the greatest courtesy in all the countries, especially France, where we have resided since our marriage, I have not lived out of England for over two years by preference. Albert, who took the name King George VI, struggled to adapt to the unwanted role of King and suffered from a severe stammer . 'I have remained away out of deference to my brother in order to leave the field clear for him to establish himself on the throne, which it is admitted he has succeeded in doing.' Dispelling newspaper claims that he had set conditions for his return, Edward writes: 'I have never made any such announcement nor would I ever set conditions upon my return to England. 'Regarding the two stipulations I am alleged to have made, I wish to say firstly, that while naturally the matter of witholding (sic) the title of Royal Highness from the Duchess is an insult which I as her husband and a member of the Royal Family have always resented far more than she has, we have too many other more important interests to worry over such a triviality. 'Secondly, whatever may be the behaviour of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth towards the Duchess, it would in no way affect any plans we might make for going to England.' Resentment: Prince Edward wrote the letter to his aristocrat friend Lord Beaverbrook in 1939 . Edward signs off the letter with a stark warning: 'I need not stress the highly confidential nature of this letter, or the grave danger of the information it contains ever being traced back to me.' The letter, on headed notepaper, was part of Lord Beaverbrook’s archive which was sold following his death in 1964. It is now being sold by an anonymous private collector from London and is expected to fetch £8,000. Charlie Jacoby, a royal expert and author, said: 'This letter is a cracker. 'It was well known that Edward was advised to stay away from England following his abdication but to hear it from the man himself is fascinating. 'It is confirmation of the Royal muscle flexing that went on at a time when they needed to appear strong and in control.' Richard Davie, of Nottingham-based International Autograph Auctions, said: 'Edward’s abdication was the biggest scandal to rock the Royal Family in years and it was not taken lightly by his mother Queen Mary or sister in law Queen Elizabeth. 'Edward was the first British monarch to voluntarily abdicate and it sparked a constitutional crisis, forcing a reluctant Prince Albert, Elizabeth’s husband, to take the throne. 'It was widely rumoured that Elizabeth never forgave her brother-in-law, and neither she nor Edward’s mother were keen on Wallis Simpson. Edward reveals his exile from England was all but forced upon him and his new wife Wallis Simpson in the aftermath of the abdication scandal .

Shelly Reilly stole nearly £250,000 she stole from her employer Scorpio UK . An oil executive hooked on gambling websites lost nearly £250,000 she had stolen from her employer as she tried to fund fertility treatment. Shelly Reilly, 41, used company credit cards to indulge in late night betting sprees on websites 888 and Jackpot Joy. The director at Monaco-based oil brokers Scorpio UK was addicted to the sites and desperately wanted to have a baby. She stole £231,000 during a ten-month scam that began after her gambling spiralled out of control and left her swimming in debt. Wearing glasses and a stylish black shift dress, Reilly blew a kiss to family in the public gallery as she was jailed yesterday. Sentencing her to 18 months, Judge David Higgins said her behaviour was ‘deplorable and deeply anti-social’ but her case was ultimately ‘tragic’. ‘You did this to feed your gambling habit which was to improve your financial standing so you could have fertility treatment,’ he said. ‘The criminal conduct was premeditated, professionally planned, sustained, sophisticated and very serious. ‘Above all, of course, it was a gross breach of the trust placed in you on repeated occasions. ‘You were in a position to exploit the company resources and you took that opportunity. Your behaviour was deplorable and deeply anti-social. ‘You were feeding a private habit which itself originated from a desire to fulfil your own wishes. ‘I fear if you choose to stoop to such sustained and serious criminal wrongdoing you must accept the consequences.’ Reilly was tempted into losing huge sums during late night sessions on gambling websites by the offer of free bets, Southwark Crown Court was told. She was soon deeply in debt and resorted to using company credit cards, including two belonging to co-workers to fuel her addiction. The fraud came to light after she was sacked for poor performance due to her ‘late night activities’ in May 2012 and the company conducted an audit. Prosecutor Peter Zinner said Reilly was initially employed in March 2010 as an office manager and was later made a director so she could deal with administrative matters. He said: ‘An investigation showed that there had been regular late night online gambling between about 2011 and 2012 it seems that Ms Reilly having been tempting into online gambling by free bets. Sentencing Reilly to 18 months at Southwark Crown Court, Judge David Higgins said case was ultimately 'tragic' ‘Instead of the jackpot joy, it appears she ran up enormous and unsustainable losses which became completely out of control and she continued to gamble with a view to recover the losses and the losses mushroomed to that very high level.’ Her barrister Paul Spreadborough said she was ‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’ and has since repaid £63,000, including £7,000 in winnings. ‘The defendant saw this as effectively borrowing the money with a view to putting it back,’ he added. ‘She used the cards to bail her out from an addiction that had taken hold of her. ‘She was unable to seek help because she had already borrowed from her family and used money from her husband’s business. ‘She wanted to have children, she was unable and both her and her partner were engaged in trying to fund fertility treatment. ‘But it is something that she knew she had to pay for because of her age. That was the initial lure into gambling. ‘The company accounts was something she took to in desperation, already caught in this downhill gambling spiral.’ Reilly, of Southgate, North London, admitted six counts of fraud by abuse of position.","Shelly Reilly, 41, used company credit cards to indulge in betting sprees .

The High Speed Rail project could still be scrapped if costs continue to soar, the Treasury’s top civil servant has warned. The government has not signed a ‘blank cheque’ for the railway line linking the capital to the Midlands and North, Nick Macpherson, the permanent secretary at the Treasury told MPs. His words are in contrast to Chancellor George Osborne’s insistence just two days ago that HS2 would go ahead. Mr Macpherson was echoing the promise made by shadow chancellor Ed Balls, that there would be ‘no blank cheque’ for the line if Labour was in power - although the opposition has stopped short of announcing it would stop HS2. Controversial: The cost of the high-speed rail line HS2 may cause the project's demise . Ministers are under pressure over burgeoning costs, which have soared from around £30 billion to more than £50 billion, not counting VAT. Mr Macpherson told MPs on the Treasury select committee: ‘If problems emerge we are not going to tinker around the edges. ‘There will be a lot of opportunities for the government to review the policy.’ He added: ‘The expenditure, most of it happens way into the future. The big financial risks are also quite a long time into the future. ‘There will be opportunities to reassess it. We have not signed a blank cheque.’ On Sunday, the Chancellor vowed the link to Manchester and Birmingham would go ahead, despite fears over soaring costs. ‘I’m passionate about this project because time and again, we have this debate in our country about how we’re going to bring the gap between north and south together, about how we’re going to make sure that our growth is not just based on the City of London,’ he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. ‘High Speed 2 is about changing the economic geography of this country, making sure the North and the Midlands benefit from the recovery as well.’ Opposition: People living near the proposed route are furious about the plans . Mr Osborne played down warnings the costs would overrun, saying: ‘We have set the budget for £42bn for the construction costs. That includes, by the way, a big contingency.’ His remarks showed a more upbeat view than Mr Macpherson, who answered a question about the project while discussing the Treasury’s annual accounts. Building of the line is due to begin in 2017. Trains will run at 225mph from London to Birmingham by 2026 and onto Manchester and Leeds by 2032-3. HS2 is opposed by many Conservative MPs and their constituents as it cuts through the Chilterns, an area of outstanding natural beauty. Residents along the proposed route are furious that many have been unable to sell their homes. Property values have been blighted near the line and the government is planning to offer compensation. Investment: The revelation that Treasury insiders are against HS2 will reinforce doubts over whether it will go ahead . Around half a million people are expected to be affected by the lengthy building of HS2. Even those nowhere near the line could find noisy lorries rumbling through their peaceful villages for years, according to the Campaign for Rural England. Business leaders have warned that it could be a giant ‘folly’ while former Chancellor Alistair Darling - who initially supported the projected - warned it could become a ‘nightmare’. Cheryl Gillan, a former Cabinet Minister whose constituency would be crossed by HS2, has said there are ‘better ways of spending £50 billion to £80 billion.’ Other critics have warned by the time the line is built, the rolling stock would be outdated and trains would be able to go faster. They have also queried why building on the line is beginning from London and the south, if the aim is to provide better transport links for those who live in the North of England. But other politicians are backing the project. Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell has said the country would ‘simply freeze up’ without investment into major projects such as HS2. Tessa Jowell, the former Labour Culture Secretary, has also argued the economic and capacity case is ‘very strong’ for HS2 to go ahead.","Top civil servant warns there is no 'blank cheque' for controversial rail plan .

An Australian man who plunged to his death while being lifted into a rescue helicopter weighed up to 22 stone, it has been reported. Robert Davis, a keen deer hunter from Sydney, fell 100ft and died on impact as he was being helped in through the doorway of the hovering helicopter. Paramedics believe weight could have played a role in the tragic accident which occurred after the 68 year-old broken his ankle while on the bush in Melbourne and called for help. Tragedy: Paramedics believe Mr Davis's weight could have played a role in the accident . A paramedic who was lowered down to Mr Davis, attached him to what is known as a strop hoist and he and the medic were winched up to the helicopter in vertical positions. But it was as Mr Davis was being helped in through the doorway that he fell. The paramedic was immediately lowered back down but the patient could not be resuscitated. Police, ambulance and government officials have now begun an investigation into what went wrong, including suggestions that Mr Davis' weight and size might have played an unfortunate part in his tragic death. People at the scene in Melbourne have characterised Mr Davis as a likeable man . Members of Mr Davis' family said last night that they were too shocked to talk about the incident. And ambulance officials said the crew were also struggling to come to terms with what had happened. Mr Davis, from Riverwood, Sydney, had been trekking through thick bushland near Lake Eildon with a friend when he broke his ankle. It was impossible for him to walk to safety, so help was called in. A taxidermist in the small town of Mansfield, closest to the scene of the tragedy, told Melbourne's Herald Sun that Mr Davis was 'a likeable sort of guy'. Paramedics and officials at the scene struggled to come to terms with what had happened . 'He loved coming down here. It's not even so much for the hunting side of it,' said Peter Anthony. 'They probably sit around and have a few beers and a wine, have a chat and talk about deer hunting and catch up with a few of the other guys they have meet over the years,' he said. Denis Napthine, state premier of Victoria, said a full inquiry would be carried out, including an examination by the Coroner, police, Ambulance Victoria and the Civil Aviation Authority. 'Our hearts go out to the family of the deceased and, of course, we also put our arms around the Ambulance Victoria officers who were working so hard to try and rescue that person and who will be absolutely devastated.' People close to the scene were devastated, describing Mr Davis as a 'likeable man' The officer who was winched with Mr Davis is a veteran of the rescue crew and one of Victoria's best paramedics. A colleague who said the tragedy had rocked Victoria's 40 specialist crew members added: 'Our hearts go out to the family'. Referring to Mr Davis, the colleague said: 'He just got to the door and he fell. 'I don't know whether he came out of the harness or what, but this gear is pretty good.' Ambulance Victoria CEO, Greg Sassella, told the same newspaper that such operations were high risk.","Paramedics believe his substantial weight may have played a role in the accident .

The bush tracker has revealed how he managed to get within 20ft of the former doorman after eight hours of moving stealthily though dense forest during the 'real life hunt'. Mears joined a Tornado fighter jet and scores of armed police officers in the £1 million-plus search. They were called in after Moat and his accomplices went to ground in woodland surrounding Rothbury, Northumberland, in July 2010. Survival expert Ray Mears (left) has spoken for the first time about his involvement in the hunt for Raoul Moat (right) in July 2010 . Mears joined a Tornado fighter jet and scores of armed police officers in the £1 million-plus search for the former doorman . Mears, 49, became involved in the search after he contacted a police search adviser he had met at a lecture years earlier to offer his skills. Police then asked for his help after an abandoned campsite on the outskirts of Rothbury, was discovered. In an interview with the Gloucestershire Echo, Mears said he got within 20ft of Moat after eight hours of moving stealthily through dense forest. He described the scene when he arrived in Rothbury as like something 'out of a Hollywood film set' with bright lights, police snipers, helicopters circling overhead and the Tornado making reconnaissance sorties.

'This is the first time I've talked about it and it's because I feel there has been sufficient water under the bridge.' Mears, who was speaking ahead of the publication of his autobiography later this month, told the newspaper that police disclosed . afterwards that Moat's emergence from hiding was a direct result of his . presence with armed officers. 'It was a real-life hunt; within my skill set but outside of my comfort zone' - Ray Mears . He said: 'It was such a unique set of circumstances. I have experience of tracking for 40 years. 'I can't imagine there would be that many people in the country who would have been in a position to help the police find someone who had gone into hiding who needed to be found. 'It was a real-life hunt; within my skill set but outside of my comfort zone.' Mears’ involvement in the Raoul Moat case was known at the time, but today was the first time he had spoken about it.

He was taken to a camp used by the . steroid-enhanced bodybuilder and, from there, led detectives on an . eight-hour trail through dense forest before he discovered Moat in . woodland near the village of Rothbury in Northumberland. Moat went on the run after shooting Chris Brown, 29, who had started a relationship with his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart. The spurned lover killed Mr Brown and seriously injured Ms Stobbart in the shooting in Birtley, Gateshead, two days after he was released from prison. The following day the 37-year-old bodybuilder shot unarmed PC David Rathband in the face, leaving him blind. The officer was found hanged at his home in Blyth, Northumberland, in February last year. The huge search for Moat, involving officers from 18 forces, was one of the biggest police operations seen in the UK. The rapidly evolving manhunt gripped the nation as newspapers, television and radio stations concentrated on the search, bringing close scrutiny of the police's actions. The 17-stone steroid addict was finally cornered at the edge of the River Coquet on the evening of July 9. Following a five-hour stand-off with armed police the father-of-three shot himself in the head at the moment officers deployed Tasers to try to disable him. Moat was declared dead in the early hours of the following day.","Survival expert Ray Mears has spoken of his involvement in 2010 hunt .

Many people blame large cafe chains for the death of individual coffee houses and making local neighborhoods more anonymous where people dash in for their caffeine kick without socialising. However, three anthropologists have challenged this popular conception by claiming three Starbucks cafes in Boston, Massachusetts provide better community spirit than independent rivals. A study from the West Virginia University found Starbucks provided a more welcoming environment based on its decor, amenities like Wi-Fi and friendly baristas. Bigger is better? Three anthropologists have challenged the popular conception that chain coffee houses are anonymous and do not add value to a local community. They claim that three Starbucks cafes in Boston, Massachusetts, provided better community spirit than independent rivals . The anthropologists looked at six coffee houses in Boston - three of which were independent - to explore how effectively Starbucks can provide a community-focused environment associated with traditional coffee shops where the staff know everybody's name, The Boston Globe reported. They conducted their observations in the six coffee houses in line with sociologist Ray Oldenburg's description of ideal urban, social spaces. To do this, they took into account: the arrangement of seating, activities taking place in the space, amenities on offer like Wi-Fi and power points, the atmosphere (measured by decor, music and volume of people talking) and how welcoming the staff were. The trio were shocked to discover that based on this criteria, Starbucks outperformed its independent rivals to provide the most welcoming atmosphere overall. Researchers said the baristas in Starbucks were friendlier to new customers than those working in independent cafes (one of which is pictured) as well as providing better amenities such as free and unlimited internet access. The exterior and interior of Pavement, which shows people working, are pictured . Among the finds were that the 'Central . Square' branch of the coffee chain in the city centre had the most vibrant sense of . community as the majority of the baristas knew their customers by name . and could anticipate their orders. The anthropologists also noted that Starbucks staff were more friendly to new customers than those working at the independent cafes they visited. The study said: 'The Starbucks baristas would help customers by explaining the many . options available and even offering suggestions. In contrast, the . baristas at the independently-owned coffee houses were more aloof and . would just wait or sometimes stare at a customer, offering minimal . assistance.' The 'Central Square' branch of Starbucks (pictured) had the most vibrant sense of community as the majority of the baristas knew their customers by name and could anticipate their orders, according to the study . The third place is a term used in the concept of community building to refer to social surroundings separate from the two usual social environments of home and the workplace. In his influential book The Great Good Place, Ray Oldenburg argues third places are important for civil society, democracy, civic engagement, and establishing feelings of a sense of place. He said the 'first place' is the home, 'second place' is at work and third places are 'anchors' of community life that encourage social interaction. Third spaces should be free or inexpensive, probably contain food or drink, are highly accessible and involve regular customers, he said. They should also be welcoming, comfortable and should contain old friends as well as the potential to meet new ones. While the chain scored points for its . friendliness, it also outperformed the independent coffee houses . visited by providing free Wi-Fi access, whereas two of the independent . shops charged for internet access or set a cap on their customers 'daily . use. The researchers said the study demonstrates the approach used by corporate coffee chains of being welcoming to everyone - even if it is in danger as being seen as bland - which contrasts with independent shops' approaches that tend to highlight their quirks to create distinctive identities. Ray Oldenburg developed the concept of 'third places' as environments that offer a sense of community, but since coming up with the idea in 1989 the traditional coffee shop has changed. 'Due to the rise of portable electronic devices and telecommuting, an increasing . number of people now use coffee houses less for socialising and more as . a hub for reading, working, and productivity,' the study said. It found that people use public coffee shops as a 'private zone' to work, and while corporate coffee houses are often criticised for their lack of character, they 'better meet customers' new third place needs by providing a wider variety of amenities and free services that are in high demand'. The researchers conducted their observations in the six coffee houses in line with sociologists Ray Oldenburg's description of ideal urban, social spaces. They found that people increasingly use public coffee shops as a 'private zone' to work.

A schoolboy rugby player died from second impact syndrome after playing rugby for 25 minutes and colliding with another player, an inquest has heard. Benjamin Robinson, 14, collapsed on the pitch at Carrickfergus, Co Antrim, in Northern Ireland, in January 2011 and died in hospital from head injuries. Coroner Suzanne Anderson told an inquest in Belfast she believed the teenager had sustained concussion during a heavy collision with another player at the start of the second half but, despite his injury, had played on for a further 25 minutes. 'I am satisfied that he sustained concussion in the first four minutes of the second half. Unfortunately neither the team coach or the referee were made aware of his neurological complaints and he continued to play,' Ms Anderson said. Benjamin, who was playing for Carrickfergus Grammar School, was involved in two other clashes during the game with Dalriada at his school grounds. In the final minutes he fell to the ground unconscious and, despite frantic efforts by a doctor who had been spectating and medics at the Royal Victoria Hospital, he never recovered. The coroner added: 'I accept the consensus opinion that the features of this death are typical of second impact syndrome which occurs when two concussive-type injuries are sustained in a short space of time. It is exceptionally rare but can affect young people between 14 and 18 whilst engaged in sporting activity. 'This is the first recorded death of its kind in Northern Ireland and most probably the first in the UK. Medical science is not able to ascertain why an individual can succumb to this exceedingly rare syndrome.' There is some evidence that children are more susceptible to second impact syndrome than adults because their brains cannot recover as well from a minor knock. Devastated: Mother Karen Walton, pictured with father Peter Robinson, said Benjamin had slept in his rugby kit . The coroner said she would present her findings to the head of Irish rugby and Northern Ireland’s Minister for Education to highlight the dangers of second impact syndrome and raise awareness about concussion management. 'I think everybody could learn from this,' she added. Outside the court, the schoolboy’s parents said they would fight for the introduction of new legislation to protect young people engaged in contact sports. His father, Peter Robinson, said: 'We welcome the Coroner’s findings and the recognition that there was a concussion early in the second half and he played a full half with concussion. Devastated: Karen Walton the mother of schoolboy Ben Robinson is comforted after speaking to the media in Belfast . 'Obviously it has been highlighted about education - it is about getting the message out to the schools. We had a policy in America, a template for all of this, that can be put in place tomorrow if they wanted. 'I would love to fight for Ben’s Law because why should children in the UK not have the rights like in America.' The family have consistently argued that Benjamin should have been taken off the pitch earlier and believe if modern guidelines on concussion management had been put in place their son would still be alive. Mr Robinson said he hoped something positive could come out of the tragedy. He added: 'We lost Ben. There has to be something good come of this. Just to make sure no other family has to go through this. It is so easily prevented. Again we go back to education and all the facts being presented to parents so they are aware.' There were harrowing scenes inside Belfast’s Old Town Hall when video footage of the match was played. In it, Benjamin could clearly be seen clutching his head on several occasions. The schoolboy’s mother, Karen Walton who had been watching from the sidelines as her son collapsed, wept uncontrollably while other friends and relatives clung to each other for support and wiped away tears. Afterwards Mrs Walton recalled how Benjamin had slept in his rugby kit and had not wanted to let team mates or his school down during the crucial match. She said the coroner’s findings provided little comfort. 'I don’t have my son back. I have an image of my 14-year-old son in his rugby kit the night before. He slept in his rugby kit because he didn’t want to forget anything and he didn’t want to let anybody down. He did not want to let anybody down during that match,' she said. 'He was the most loveable, loving, likeable, honest kid. He was just a 14-year-old kid who is missed every second of every day. He was a very loyal boy, outspoken but a good kid, a great son and a fantastic brother.' The coroner described the video images as 'extremely useful' and said they were 'better than a witness statement' because they could not be disputed. The inquest previously heard how Benjamin had appeared dazed and confused towards the end of the game. A team mate said he had not been aware of the score that his team was winning. It was also claimed that after one collision Benjamin had to be helped up by the team coach. Cause of death was officially recorded as cerebral oedema and subdural haemorrhage associated with second impact syndrome.","Benjamin Robinson died in Co. Antrim, Northern Ireland, in January 2011 .

The average salary for women is more than £6,000 less than men at £24,228. Men with partners earning that average figure would expect a present valued at £155. Obviously as income increases, so does the expectation on spending – so a woman whose partner earned around £100,000 would expect a present costing around £1,000.

A former heroin addict who was jailed after he terrified elderly residents at an Essex mobile home park has been given the go-ahead to argue in the highest court in the land that the park landlords have breached his human rights by ordering him off the site. In a case which will rocket an already hefty legal bill to more than £100,000, three Supreme Court judges have given the green light for Brian Telchadder, 48, to challenge the landlords. Most of the money funding the case is being paid through legal aid. In a case which will rocket an already hefty legal bill to more than £100,000, judges have given the green light for Brian Telchadder to challenge landlords . The owner of the mobile home site, who has no alternative but to contest the case in the Supreme Court, branded the use being made of legal aid as 'outrageous' and an 'absolute disgrace.' He is facing legal costs of £50,000 or more which will have to be paid out of his own pocket. The courts have been told that Telchadder's history includes heroin addiction, issuing death threats to site residents, wandering the Essex woods in camouflage clothing including a masked camouflage hat and has had weapons seized by police from his caravan. He was jailed for seven days by Colchester Magistrates in 2010 after he pleaded guilty to using threatening words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. He opted for prison rather than a fine. Brian Telchadder was jailed for seven days by Colchester Magistrates after he pleaded guilty to using threatening words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress . In August 2011, in the light of his behaviour, a judge at Southend County Court terminated his licence to occupy the site leaving him with the option of removing the mobile home or selling it. That order won the backing of three of the country’s top judges - Lord Justice Mummery, Lady Justice Black and Dame Janet Smith - in the Appeal Court last year. Telchadder, who estimates he has currently run up Legal Aid bills of around £60,000, had instructed human rights and civil liberties law firm Fisher Jones Greenwood LLP and barrister Lindsay Johnson to argue that he had been discriminated against and his human rights had been breached. But Lord Justice Mummery, said in his judgment, which was unanimously approved by the other judges, that Telchadder had approached a resident, Brian Carter, with threats to kill him and two other residents. He continued: 'He threatened Mr Carter with a martial arts stick. He said ""I shoot rabbits, I could shoot you.""' The judge added: 'He has a strong interest in martial arts and in weapons, including bayonets and knives, which have been removed by the police. 'He likes to wander in the woods near the site in camouflage clothing, including a masked camouflage hat, which makes his appearance very startling to residents of the site.' Meadowview Park mobile home site in Little Clacton where Brian Telchadder has been asked to leave . On a later search of Telchadder’s mobile home police found a 'substantial collection of weapons or weapon-like objects was found' the judge said. In backing the county court judge who paved the way for Telchadder to be evicted, Lord Justice Mummery said that Telchadder suffers from a mild learning disability, autistic traits and an anxiety disorder and has a history of heroin addiction. But he said the county court judge had taken all this into consideration. He ruled: 'The judge’s conclusion was not a perverse one.' Telchadder admitted his legal costs are around the £60,000 mark but said his human rights needed to be protected . He said that in view of Telchadder’s ongoing anti-social activities, both before and after he was given notice of the consequences of it continuing, and its detrimental effect on the legitimate rights and interests of the other residents and of the claimant, it was 'difficult to see how the judge could properly have arrived at a different decision.' Now though, the Law Lords - Lady Hale, Lord Sumption and Lord Reed - have paved the way for a hearing which could stack up a total legal bill of £100,000 or more. Cases before the Supreme Court are normally argued by top earning QCs. Telchadder, who was happy to wear some of his camouflage gear this week and pose in it for a photograph, admitted his legal costs are around the £60,000 mark but said his human rights needed to be protected. He added: 'If I get evicted I would become homeless and have to live in my two man tent and cost the government even more money.' However, Len Collins, owner of the site, in Little Clacton, who is not legally aided and who has already had to pay out £30,000 in legal costs and anticipates this will go up to £50,000 or more with the Supreme Court hearing said: 'The whole situation where some-one can use public money in this way is an absolute disgrace. It’s outrageous that after him losing in the County Court and the Court of Appeal they are still prepared to fund him in the way they are. 'There is something drastically wrong with a system that allows public money to be used in this way.' No date has yet been fixed for the Supreme Court hearing but it will probably be next year.","Brian Telchadder has been given the go ahead to challenge the landlords of a mobile home site in Essex .

An ambulance called to help him failed to turn up . An investigation was launched last night after paramedics confessed they were called to help a fatally injured teenager but did not turn up. Police asked ambulance service controllers to send help when they discovered George Verrier, 17, dazed and bleeding after a mass brawl. But they did not respond for almost an hour and half, during which time friends claimed officers told him to catch a bus to hospital. Instead he staggered half a mile to a friend’s house where he was discovered unconscious the next morning. He was airlifted to hospital where he died nine hours later. Last night the apprentice electrician’s stunned family demanded answers as police launched an internal inquiry. Relative Lesley Herron, 58, said his family are ‘living a nightmare’. Speaking at his great-aunt's house, she said: ‘We feel he could have been saved. We don't know the facts yet, but we feel he could have been saved. ‘We want answers. The family wants answers. We just want to know if he could have been saved. ‘If we find that he could have survived and we could have had the chance to see him married with children, that would be awful. But we don't know what is to be. ‘I don't know how we will cope. It will add to our burden of grief.’ Cousin Paul Houston said: ‘We were told that George was told to make his own way to accident and emergency. ‘Surely that should not be the case if someone has a knock on the head? We want answers. It is such a loss. ‘George was such a lovely gentle boy. He went to sleep and never woke up.’ Paramedics did not respond for almost an hour and a half after Mr Varrier was injured in the fight. Friends also claimed that police officers told him to catch a bus to hospital . George was seriously injured when fighting broke out among dozens of teenagers after a 16th birthday party at a £500,000 home in suburban Bromley, South-East London. Many of those at the party were students at the renowned Brit School of performing arts in Croydon, whose former pupils include singers Adele and Jessie J. Police officers discovered the teenager bleeding from a face wound and gave him first aid when they were called to the scene shortly after midnight on Sunday. Friends claimed they told George to ‘get a bus’ to hospital but he instead chose to walk home, clearly not realising the seriousness of his injuries. With no ambulance to take him to hospital, Mr Verrier staggered half a mile to a friend's house, dazed and bleeding, and where he was discovered unconscious the next morning . But sources revealed officers also contacted London Ambulance Service (LAS) and requested help, but no-one came. An LAS spokeswoman confirmed that staff were called to an ‘assault’ at 1am to help a patient who was ‘fully conscious’. But she added that they were ‘unable to respond’ and were stood down at 2.20am. Yesterday, George’s heart-broken family and friends said they were still coming to terms with their sudden loss. Paying tribute to ‘gorgeous George’, Miss Herron said his family are paralysed with grief. She said: ‘It is crazy, we are living in a nightmare, the whole family is having a nightmare but we know we are not going to wake up. ‘He was a precious boy, precious to the family. There are no words to describe what his father has lost. He was his only son.’ Mr Verrier's family have now demanded answers into what happened and police have launched an internal inquiry . The family are coping with a second death in less than nine months after George's grandmother Jean Verrier died on Christmas Day, aged 81. Miss Herron said: ‘George was the apple of her eye. ‘She had developed pneumonia, maybe it was better for her to be taken at Christmas than for her to have survived and seen this. It would have killed her. ‘His father had cancer a few years back and he came through all of that with George by his side helping. ‘Even as a young lad he was like a man. He was a darling boy. It is like this happened to an angel, he had such a good soul. ‘It has destroyed us all, we are never going to get over this. I don't know how we are going to put one foot forward in all of this. ‘We read about it and bleed for people who this has happened too, and now it's us bleeding. It is a total tragedy that should never have happened.’ Other relatives of the young victim revealed he was an organ donor, with one saying: ‘Three people walked out of that hospital because of him.’ George's great-aunt Norma Verrier, 79, broke down as she told of her heartache at his death. She said: ‘He was a beautiful boy, he was gorgeous. ‘This is the worst thing that has ever happened to our family. He was a dear boy, he was no trouble. ‘It's a nightmare that you see on TV and hear about on the radio but it's other people's nightmare – now it's ours. ‘He was such a sweetheart. He loved his family - his mum, dad, cousins - and his friends.’ His cousin Louis Verrier said: ‘The family are too upset to speak at the moment and want some peace and quiet. ‘They feel as you would imagine they would. They just lost their baby.’ Friend Sam Abbabiyi said: 'George was a good friend of mine. He was not the sort of person who went looking for trouble. I am certain he would not have started it. ‘He was a really good guy. It is very sad what has happened.’ Mr Verrier was seriously injured after a fight among dozens of teenagers after a 16th birthday outside this house in Bromley, South East London . The young victim, a former pupil at Sir Roger Manwood’s School, in Sandwich, Kent, had two older sisters, Jessica, 23, and Nancy, 21. Friends have placed flowers, pictures, a Crystal Palace football shirt and messages on a tree at a green space near where he suffered his fatal injuries. A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said managers have launched an internal inquiry and will also co-operate fully with police. She said: ‘We can confirm that we were called to reports of an assault in Blenheim Road at 1.01am on Sunday morning. ‘The patient was reported to have been fully conscious but we were unable to respond at the time and were subsequently cancelled at around 2.20am before we were able to attend the scene. ‘We are now looking into the circumstances of what happened.’ A Met spokesman said: ‘The Met has made a voluntary referral to the IPCC to assess the actions of the officers who attended the scene.’ An IPCC spokeswoman said the Met will carry out its own investigation into contact between its officers and George before his death. She said that if any ‘conduct matters’ come to light during the inquiry then they will reconsider that decision.","George Verrier, 17, was injured after a fight at a house party in London .

Warning: Chancellor George Osborne said families in Scotland will be worse off if voters back independence next year . People living in Scotland would each be £2,000 better off if they vote against independence, George Osbonre claimed today. The Chancellor said incomes would rise by four per cent after 30 years, equivalent to £5billion in today’s prices. But if voters choose to sever ties with the UK in next year;s independence referendum, Scotland would have to make ‘very substantial cuts’ of up to £8billion in public spending, Mr Osborne suggested. A new Treasury report published today says that incomes in Scotland are likely to increase if the country chooses to stay in the Union rather than vote for independence. It argues that ‘remaining part of the borderless United Kingdom could boost real incomes in Scotland by as much as 4 per cent after 30 years, equivalent to £5 billion in 2012 prices or £2,000 per household’. The report adds: ‘Independence would fundamentally transform and fragment this relationship, ending the pooling of resources and risk-sharing between Scotland and the rest of the UK, and erecting a border where one doesn’t currently exist. By contrast, the analysis suggests that exports from an independent Scotland to the continuing UK could be over 80 per cent lower after 30 years. Mr Osborne, who delivered a speech in Aberdeen to the oil and gas industry, said it would take £8 billion out of the budget to divert revenue into a an oil fund after independence . Scotland can ‘go it alone’, he said, but as part of the UK it has a broader base to ‘absorb’ fluctuations in the revenue. He dismissed the idea that Scotland could set up an oil fund, like in Norway, without making severe public spending cuts. ‘By our calculation you'd have to make some very substantial cuts - £8 billion of cuts - to Scottish public spending,’ he told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme. ‘Even if you were getting all the money from Scottish oil, you'd have to make big, big cuts – 5 per cent of the GDP - to your education budget, to your health budget, before you could even start putting money into an oil fund.’ However, the claims were dismissed by the Scottish government. A spokesman for Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘With household budgets expected to fall by £1,800 in the next two years as part of the UK – and at least another four years of cuts to Scotland’s budget – it is only a Yes vote in 2014 that can deliver real opportunities for Scotland. ‘Westminster’s economic policies have seen key industries close down, communities abandoned and generations of Scots let down.’ Referendum: Voters will have their say on independence on September 18 2014 . Scottish voters will have their say on leaving the UK in a referendum on September 18 next year. Most opinion polls have shown support for independence in the high twenties. But a surprise new Panelbase survey, commissioned by the SNP put the Yes campaign one point ahead on 44 per cent. The Treasury analysis says that there would be two ‘fundamental fiscal consequences’ if Scotland became an independent country. Dispute: The Independence debate has been dominated by wrangling over the value and access to revenues from Scotland's oil supplies . Firstly, Scotland would need to rely on a narrower and more volatile tax base to fund spending on public services, according to the Treasury. Secondly, independence would result in the break-up of the UK tax system. A separate tax system would need to be implemented in Scotland with potential implications for business, individuals and both governments. Mr Osborne will also unveil the final decommissioning deed - a contract which gives oil and gas companies certainty over the level of tax relief that they will receive for decommissioning. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney said: ‘North Sea oil is a bonus, not the basis for Scotland's economy and, with up to 24 billion barrels of oil left worth an estimated £1.5 trillion, it will continue to contribute to the wealth of Scotland for a long time to come. ‘Leaving decisions at Westminster has cost Scotland 30 years of an oil fund and it was only the vociferous arguments of the industry and the Scottish Government that prevented investment being set back by years. ‘The Scottish Government has made clear commitments to the industry that demonstrate the benefits of decisions being made in Scotland and that means a Yes vote next year will secure a strong future for Scotland's oil industry.’","Chancellor claims incomes will rise by 4% if Scotland stays in the UK .

Recorder Mr Robert Linford Ahmed adjourned sentence while a probation report is prepared. He warned Ahmed: 'The fact that I am ordering a pre-sentence report is not to be taken by you as an indication of the sentence you will receive. 'The offences to which you have pleaded guilty are in my view a most gross breach of trust and are almost inevitably going to be met by an immediate prison sentence.' The court heard the voyeurism charges involved eight female victims between March 26 and June 14 last year. One of the sexual assault charges involved Ahmed moving a female patients gown upwards to expose the victims breasts and genitals to enable his secret camera to take a photograph. The second related to Ahmed touching a female patient’s abdomen during an intimate examination. Ahmed, of Cardiff, is currently suspended. He was released on bail and will be sentenced on October 4.

Jean-Marc Hodgkin has been warned he faces a jail sentence after ploughing his horsebox into a pensioner . A City high-flyer is facing jail tonight after he was found guilty of ploughing his horsebox into a pensioner and left him pinned to his bonnet. Ex-London Stock Exchange boss Jean-Marc Hodgkin was convicted of dangerous driving today following the incident that left Michael Parker, 74, with severe leg injuries. He was cleared of the more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm to Mr Parker. Judge Gordon Risius today said he could not rule out a prison sentence for Mr Hodgkin after the jury delivered their verdict. The father-of-two was told he will definitely be banned from driving. Judge Risius said: 'I think that given the importance of getting the right sentence the proper course would be for me to adjourn for a pre-sentence report so I can ensure that all the options are properly covered. 'The fact I’m adjourning indicates that custody is a possibility but equally there are alternatives.' Polo-playing Hodgkin, who wore a pinstriped suit and red tie, was emotionless when the verdict was read out at Oxford Crown Court after four hours and 25 minutes of jury deliberation. The jury had been told that Hodgkin had become furious after Mr Parker reversed his green Land Rover Discovery from the middle of a 30mph road into his driveway on August 4 last year. Hodgkin, who had three of his polo horses and 250 litres of water in his Mercedes vehicle, was then forced to brake and stop just yards from Mr Parker’s vehicle near a dipped kerb. An argument erupted between the pair, . with Hodgkin allegedly calling Michael Parker a ‘cretin’, . ‘country bumpkin’ and a ‘f****** idiot’. Mr Parker admitted that he also . used foul language before he was struck after getting out of his car. Hodgkin, who had his 15-year-old daughter in the car, was accused of swinging his vehicle and three of his prized polo horses in the Mercedes, to the left - trapping Mr Parker on the bonnet of the Land Rover. He then drove off from the A418 Aylesbury Road, Bierton, near Aylesbury, Bucks., leaving the pensioner on the ground with severe leg injuries, the court was told. Hodgkin was found guilty of dangerous driving but cleared of causing GBH . Passing motorists stopped . to assist the pensioner, who sustained a deep cut to his leg, a . dislocated knee requiring an operation and damage to ligaments and . muscles. Prosecutor Sandra Beck previously told the jury the impact of the . pinning motion had bent the front grill of Mr . Parker’s Land Rover towards the passenger side. 'That impact caused a . very serious injury - a dislocated knee requiring an operation with . ligament and muscular injury,' she had said during the trial. Hodgkin, who has worked for KPMG and served on the board of trustees at two schools in Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, maintained that he had not deliberately driven into the pensioner. Hodgkin previously said he was 'shocked, confused and upset' when police told him about Mr Parker's injuries. He said: 'I think it was a horrible accident. It was an accident I didn’t know about at the time.' Hodgkin with his polo team. He had been driving with horses and his 15-year-old daughter . He will be sentenced on September 30 and has been banned from driving until that date. Mr Parker, who walks with a stick, . told the court during the trial: ‘There was a verbal confrontation. The words were . grossly unpleasant. Four-letter words were involved.

Glamour: Health minster Anna Soubry said she took up smoking because she liked the 'gorgeous' St Moritz packets . Health minister Anna Soubry today revealed ‘gorgeous’ cigarette packets persuaded her to take up smoking as a ‘symbol of glamour’. The outspoken Tory MP said she fell victim to the ‘power’ of the green, gold and silver St Moritz packet as a 17-year-old in Worksop. The coalition has shelved plans to force cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging, but Miss Soubry appeared to suggest there was a direct link between marketing and youngsters taking up smoking. Speaking during a debate in Parliament, Miss Soubry also compared nicotine addiction to heroin dependence. Earlier this year the government ditched plans for plain packets in the UK, with ministers saying they wanted more time to examine how a similar scheme has worked in Australia. But Miss Soubry, 56, revealed that as a ‘weak’ teenager working in a toy shop she had been motivated to take up smoking by the powerful appeal of the packaging. She told MPs: ‘I wanted to make it absolutely clear, like so many smokers I took up smoking before the age of 18. It's one of these moments where you always most want to confess. ‘It sounds very weak, I accept. But the power of the packet as a 17-year-old in Worksop bizarrely working in a toy shop, which in those days sold cigarettes."" She went on: ‘I have never forgotten the first time I bought a packet of cigarettes and I deliberately chose a packet of St Moritz because they were green and they were gorgeous and they were a symbol of, may I say, glamour. ‘And I distinctly remember, and I admit, it was the power of that package, it was the opening of the cellophane, the gold and the silver, that is so powerfully important in many people who as youngsters take up smoking.’ However Ms Soubry, who has now given up smoking, said standardised packaging was ‘no silver bullet’ to cutting the number of young people who take up the habit. She said: ‘There is no simple solution to the difficulty and the problem that we have in persuading that remaining 20 per cent of the population to give up smoking and of course to persuade our youngsters not to smoke.’ Symbol: Miss Soubry said should was drawn to the St Moritz packet in the early 1970s . Miss Soubry was elected in 2010, but has been tipped for promotion in the forthcoming reshuffle after her straight-talking spell at the Department of Health. In a frank account of her own difficulties in giving up smoking, she suggested nicotine was more addictive than Class A drugs. ‘It's . often said that nicotine is actually more addictive even than heroin, . and whilst I've never directly experienced heroin I've experienced . enough clients when I was a criminal barrister to know how powerful the . heroin and cocaine is,’ Miss Soubry said. ‘But . goodness me, even they will tell you that when it comes to nicotine . it's a dreadful substance in its addiction, which would account for why . it is so many people, who like me smoked, found it so difficult to give . up.’ Delay: Ministers say they want to consider the impact of laws passed in Australia mean cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking . Tory MP Bob Blackman said it would be a ‘tragedy’ for children and their families to delay the introduction of plain packaging. Mr Blackman, secretary of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health, said if the Government waits three years before introducing plain packs there would be 600,000 more children smoking. He added: ‘The key here is stopping children starting smoking in the first place. The analysis produced by statisticians at Cancer Research, which I don't think is disputed, is that 207,000 children under the age of 16 start to smoke every year. ‘So if the Government wait three years, from December 2012, when standardised packages were introduced in Australia, around 600,000 children will begin to smoke before the Government take any action. ‘That's great news for Philip Morris and big tobacco. What a tragedy for the children, their families and their communities in later life.’","The 'power' of packaging persuaded Tory MP to take up habit aged 17 .

Charities and campaigning groups fear they could be hampered by new government plans designed to regulate lobbyists. Ministers have drawn up rules which they say will make the links between politicians and big businesses more transparent. But the legislation was fiercely attacked by dozens of charities and think-tanks who say it will prevent legitimate campaigning. Charities and campaigning groups say the new rules passed yesterday at the House of Commons will prevent legitimate campaigning . The law would introduce a compulsory register of lobbyists for people working as independent consultants following scandals about attempts to influence government decision-making. But it would also brings in caps on the spending of non-political organisations during the year before an election. The rule, which is intended to target the power and funding leveraged by trade unions, means organisations will be able to spend only £390,000 nationally – down from £989,000. In individual constituencies they will see their spending during election year capped at just £9,750. The law managed to pass the House of Commons yesterday by 300 votes to 249. It is expected to face more difficulties in the House of Lords. However former cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan told MPs that people who were fighting the HS2 rail  project ‘firmly believe the Bill contains provisions that will inhibit their effectiveness in ensuring that their voice is heard by the Government’. Joe Rukin, campaign manager of Stop HS2 said: ‘It’s an absolute disaster. We feel we have been victims of our own success. Former cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan told MPs that people fighting HS2 believe the Bill will 'inhibit' their voices being heard but Andrew Lansley insisted charities could make their case 'as forcefully as they wish' 'The government don’t like what we have been saying so they want to make our activities illegal. Campaign groups exist to change politicians opinions, so this could not be more against the principle of free speech, it’s insane and rotten to the core. ‘This bill is in the name of clipping the wings of big money cloak and dagger lobbying and yet, because it only affects those whose major business is lobbying, lots of them will actually miss the bullet.’ Jeremy Lefroy, the Tory MP for Stafford, pointed out that important campaigns ‘may only arise during an election campaign’. And a group of major charities – including the Royal British Legion, Oxfam and the British Heart Association – have signed a letter to ministers explaining their opposition to the new rules. But Leader of the House Andrew Lansley insisted charities could make their case ‘as forcefully as they wish’ unless they were using money to try and ensure the election of particular candidates. And a Downing Street spokesman said: ‘This Bill will take the big money out of politics so you don’t have unaccountable funding pouring into constituencies. It will not substantially change the rules for charities.’","Charities say new rules will prevent legitimate campaigning .

Wonga approves 10,400 loans a day and makes £1.2million a week in profit, it emerged yesterday. The number of loans handed out by the controversial payday loans company has soared by 70 per cent in a year. Wonga, which charges stratospheric annual interest rates, was criticised yesterday for profiting from the misery of the poor and encouraging them to sink deeper into debt. Big business: The payday loan company, whose television advert is shown, was criticised for profiting from the misery of the poor . On the rise: The number of loans handed out by the company has soared 70 per cent in a year . Citizens Advice said it was wrong that people were being ‘bombarded with glossy payday loan adverts which mask the misery of a life in debt’. Chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘Payday lenders’ profits come directly from the pockets of consumers, many of whom turn to them out of desperation rather than choice.’ MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned against payday loan firms, said: ‘Money made in this industry comes at a heavy cost to our country.’ But Errol Damelin, Wonga’s founder and chief executive, insisted it was ‘lending responsibly ... to people who can generally afford to pay us back quickly.’ He said most of its customers were ‘young, single, employed, digitally savvy and can pay us back on time’, adding: ‘This is not about people on breadlines being desperate. ‘This is about us serving customers who want to take a loan and know they can pay it back in three days, in the same way that they want to buy one song on iTunes.’ Launched when the credit crunch struck in 2007, Wonga – which advertises itself on TV with elderly puppet characters Betty, Earl and Joyce, lends up to £1,000 at a time. Opposed: MP Stella Creasy has spoken out against payday loan firms like Wonga . But there is growing concern over the ease with which money can be borrowed from the firm and other payday lenders at sky-high rates. Critics claim they encourage vulnerable people further into debt by allowing those who cannot repay loans to extend them, and letting customers take out a second loan before repaying their first. Last year, Wonga approved 3.8million loans, a rise of nearly 60 per cent on 2011, according to its financial report, published yesterday. After lending more than a £1billion in a year for the first time, it now plans to expand by encouraging customers to buy luxuries they would otherwise struggle to afford. Its ‘Pay Later’ deal allows borrowers to buy ‘higher value goods’, such as furniture or a dishwasher, for up to £1,000, with an up-front charge of 7 per cent of the price. Critics such as Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby want to set up rival, ethical lenders, but their ambitions  lag far behind Wonga’s successful business model. But Matthew Lawrence, of the Institute for Public Policy Research think-tank, said critics were fighting a losing battle, adding: ‘Wonga-bashing isn’t working. Wonga’s profits make it clear that the campaign for affordable, short-term credit is losing, while Wonga is winning.’","Controversial firm Wonga approves 10,400 loans a day it has emerged .

Stephen Barnsdale-Quean allegedly used a rolling pin to tighten a noose around the neck of his wife Chantelle (pictured) as he strangled her in bed . A husband strangled his wife before stabbing himself with a kitchen knife to make it appear as if she had killed herself after attacking him, a court heard. Stephen Barnsdale-Quean, 43, allegedly used a rolling pin to tighten a noose around his wife Chantelle's neck as he strangled her in bed. A jury was told how he allegedly twisted the rolling pin six times to tighten a black picture chain around his wife's neck. He had earlier made the ligature, using the chain and an elasticated hair bobble, which he slipped over her neck before using the rolling pin to tighten it. A jury at Sheffield Crown Court heard how Barnsdale-Quean claimed his 35-year-old wife, who was suffering from depression, 'frenziedly' attacked him with a kitchen knife which was still stuck in his abdomen when paramedics arrived. The father-of-two later told police she had used the ligature to kill herself at the flat they shared in Darfield, near Barnsley, on March 4 this year. But the prosecution say scientific evidence proves she could not have strangled herself in such a way and her husband cut himself superficially then dripped his own blood over his wife’s body as she lay dead on the bed. The couple, who both worked for the Department of Work and Pensions, had been married for ten years but had run into financial trouble and their previous home was repossessed. Michael Slater, prosecuting, said after strangling his wife, Barnsdale-Quean cut his face, neck, arms, chest and leg 'to give the false impression that he had been attacked by the deceased who had then gone on to take her own life using that ligature arrangement'. The defendant was arrested in an ambulance on the way to hospital. When interviewed two days later he said she had attacked him with a knife for no apparent reason and suggested she had then killed herself. But Mr Slater said although the couple had serious cash problems and were both in ill-health, Mrs Barnsdale-Quean had never spoken of suicide to her family or friends in the previous months. She had been off work ill but returned in January and in five police interviews after her death her husband never mentioned that she had discussed taking her own life. A jury at Sheffield Crown Court heard how Barnsdale-Quean claimed his 35-year-old wife 'frenziedly' attacked him with a kitchen knife . A paramedic found Barnsdale-Quean gasping for breath face down in the hallway with a small kitchen knife sticking out of his abdomen after he called the emergency services. The medic found his wife lying dead on the bed with her head on the pillow she used for reading. The ligature with the rolling pin was attached to the left side of her neck. The defendant told him: 'She went berserk.' 'She was either unconscious or dead on . the bed already when someone came and dripped blood - her husband. This gives the lie to him saying he didn’t know what happened' - Prosecutor Michael Slater . As he was being taken to hospital the knife which had only slightly penetrated his stomach fell out. When doctors at Barnsley District Hospital asked him how he got his cuts and scratches he replied: 'I was defending myself.' No defensive wounds were found on his hands and he did not require surgery. Mr Slater said: 'He never was attacked by Chantelle or anyone else, he did it himself.' In police interviews the defendant claimed his wife attacked him with a knife. 'She was just swinging and swinging. I was trying to get away,' he said. He remembered the knife sticking into his belly before collpasing in the hallway. 'There was blood everywhere and I thought I was going to die,' he said. Barnsdale-Quean said the couple had been living in the south of England but moved back to Barnsley in 2002 and later got married. She had suffered two miscarriages and would fall into dark, depressive moods for which she took anti-depressants. She had a temper and suffered from tiredness and crippling back and stomach pains. He said she stayed in bed while he got up early, ironed the clothes, made her packed lunch and got breakfast for their two daughters before taking them to school. He also did the cooking and cleaning. On the morning of her death he had given her a half-hour massage and they had made love before he began dozing on the sofa. He claims he woke up to find his wife scratching and clawing at his neck. 'It was like a sawing motion, bizarre, strange,' he said. 'I was in shock, horror and disbelief.' The attack culminated in the knife sticking in his abdomen. The court also heard his wife, who on the day had taken a cocktail of drugs mainly for depression, had been in contact with a former partner on Facebook and they had exchanged texts. Mr Slater said there were numerous drips of his blood on the victim which had all been deposited when she was motionless. 'She was either unconscious or dead on the bed already when someone came and dripped blood - her husband,' he said. 'This gives the lie to him saying he didn’t know what happened.' Earlier Barnsdale-Quean told police they were happily married. 'I loved her, she loved me,' he said. The trial continues.

He also captured some stunning and . often comical pictures of other creatures, bug and small, including . colourful lizards and a pair of quizzical-looking owls. Mr . Lochner travelled a colossal 100,000km during his time at the Kgalagadi . Transfrontier Park in South Africa. The images, collected in his new . book 'The Dark Side of the Kalahari', capture the awe-inspiring beauty . and breathtaking diversity of life in the region. Shooting . mostly at night, the Cape Town-born photographer had to brave . night-time temperatures of -13 in the winter, while trying to catch up . on his sleep in sweltering 40C heat in the day. 'I have always been fascinated by leopards, and my dream was to follow and document a leopard raising cubs in this Kalahari hostile environment,' Hannes said. 'There are few female leopards in the south of the park, and we started tracking one with a cub of 12 months old. Magical: Filming Luna with her cubs was the highlight of Mr Lochner's two-year project immersed in the Kalahari Desert, describing the special moments with the cubs as 'incredible' Framed: Luna was the focus of Mr Lochner's attention throughout the two years he spent in the desert, following her day and night, but she was most active at night . 'She was not very accommodating, and took . us at least three months to get used to us. She didn't have a tracking . device so we had to track her the hard way. Lots of hours in the bush.' The leopard, named Luna, had to protect her cubs from the park's lions, cheetah, spotted hyenas, brown hyenas and jackals, all of whom will kill cubs on sight. The leopardess had three litters during the two years and three months she was trailed by Lochner. Her middle two cubs were killed by a brown hyena, but she later gave birth to another two which survived. Entertainment: During his two-year project, Mr Lochner was privy to a host of fascinating and often comical moments in the animal kingdom in the Kalahari Desert, including this fox cub playing with a mouse . Baffled: These two owls appeared to be bemused and fascinated by an insect that scurried between them . All creatures great and small: Animals both large and small were snapped by Mr Lochner during his time in the Kalahari, including this tiny lizard (L), snapped scuttling across the sand at night, and another lizard (R) captured balancing on a seed pod as it blew in the wind . Also, unusually for leopards, she was regularly joined by 'family man' Oscar, the father of all three litters. Lochner . was accompanied on his travels by his partner Noa Koefler, who did all . the film work for the project. Her video clips can be seen on the App . that will be released at the end October to accompany Lochner's images. First light: Luna had three litters of cubs throughout the two years she was photographed, the first and last set survived, the middle set of cubs were taken by hyenas . Predator: Among the many predators in the desert that would eat Luna's cubs were the lions . Close up: Fearless lions could easily take Luna's cubs is the opportunity arose . High alert: Luna was alone in the desert protecting and feeding herself and her cubs; the lions worked in a pride and there were always members on high alert for opportunities for food . Deadly: The roar of the lions and other greeting calls could be heard from miles across the desert . During the day, the pride of lions would often rest - as would Luna - as the temperatures rose and the flies came out . Pack: A group of jackals also posed a threat, capable of taking Luna's cubs if hungry. Here they fight over the remains of a carcass in the Kalahari, South Africa . As the sun set, the big cats, including Luna and her cubs and the lions, would seek out opportunities for food and Mr Lochner would begin taking his photos . Attentive: The striking looking female leopard scoured the desert when night fell searching for threats and opportunities for food . Asked to nominate his favourite moment from his two years in the Kalahari, Lochner goes for his time photographing Luna's cubs. 'They are amazing animals and incredible to photograph, we spent time at at least 12 different den sites,' he added. Snarl: A close-up of a leopard's mouth shows a healthy set of sharp teeth to the camera . Dramatic: Night time work produced some incredible shots, including this lioness trying to sleep as thunder storm raged nearby . Beneath a blanket of stars, one leopard was captured walking past a magnificent lone tree in the desert . Serene: A single owl flew into a stunning night-time landscape of the Kalahari Desert, as lightning lit up the horizon . Silent: A lone leopard scans the vegetation from a rocky perch on a starry night, captured in this incredible time-elapsed photo of the night sky . Photographer Hannes Lochner spent much of his time taking photos at night from his jeep while his partner Noa Koefler did all the film work for the project . Mr Lochner's book 'The Dark Side of the Kalahari' chronicles the life of Luna the leopard and her struggle to raise her litters of cubs .","Wildlife photographer Hannes Lochner spent two years in the Kalahari documenting nocturnal life of Luna the leopard .

The estate, run by his two sons, has sued a non-profit organization run by King's daughter, Bernice, claiming she planned to keep using her father's 'irreplaceable' memorabilia despite no longer being licensed to do so. The lawsuit claims speeches, recordings and even the remains of King, who was assassinated in 1968, are at risk of being damaged by fire, mold and theft. Protection: Martin Luther King III and his brother Dexter run the assassinated civil rights leader's estate . Accusations: The center Bernice King is chief executive of is allegedly not taking care of her father's memorabilia . King's niece, Alveda, is also accused of trying to hamper an audit of his possessions carried out by the estate. A lawsuit, filed in Fulton County Court last month by Martin Luther King III and Dexter King, claims the estate licensed intellectual property rights to The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in March 2009. The center's chief executive is the youngest child of King, and his estate has been its largest donor in the past decade, according to Courthouse News Service. More...

Since then, the estate allegedly had to end the worldwide royalty-free licensing agreement by serving the King Center a 30-day notice. The decision can be overturned, but only if the center puts Bernice King on administrative leave until the audit is complete. Audit: Martin Luther King's estate has carried out an audit at the center that houses his memorabilia . The center would also need approval for the use and treatment of memorabilia from the estate and would have to remove Alveda King from its board. An attorney for Bernice King said in a letter that the center 'is taking action to work a violation of plaintiff's intellectual property rights,' according to the estate. It wants a court order forcing the King Center to stop using its intellectual property after the license expires in September.","Audit claims memorabilia is at risk of theft and mold .

Police in Florida have arrested a cat burglar accused of stealing more than $10 million worth of fine antique silver. For years, the precious pieces of silver were stolen mainly from historic mansions across the south and celebrity homes including those belonging to Billy Joel and Ivana Trump. In virtually every instance, no clues were left and the robber, Blane Nordahl, 51, would even cover his tracks, replacing panes of glass removed from windows. Arrested: Blane Nordahl after his arrest in Hilliard, Florida on Monday morning. He was charged with burglaries in Atlanta . To catch a thief: Lonnie Mason, a retired New Jersey detective, suspected that a series of thefts in the South might be the work of an old adversary. He made a career out of chasing Blane Nordahl . The Nassau County Sheriff's Office in Florida say Nordahl was expert at sneaking past ‘sleeping dogs’ and disabling alarm systems. ‘When all alarms were disabled, he would remove entire drawers full of silver items and take them outside to test them with his own silver test kit; plate silver would be thrown away at the scene and he would leave with only the finest and most expensive items,’ said Sheriff Bill Leeper said in a statement. Only the finest: Blane Nordahl would only snatch high-quality silverware, leaving behind lesser silver and cheaper jewellery . The robberies began in February 2011 yet despite dozens taking place across the South from Tennessee to Florida, local police seemed unable to connect the dots until a retired New Jersey police detective who had put Nordahl away five times previously, worked it out. Ex-cop Lonnie Mason first put Nordahl away in 1983 and figured it wouldn’t be  long before he got up to his old tricks. He put together a four-man crew of retired police detectives and one retired federal marshal with the sole purpose of tracking Nordahl and putting him behind bars. All of the retired detectives came across the silver stealer at least once in their respective professional paths, in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and . Connecticut. ‘I started Googling silver thefts,’ Mason told ABCNews.com. ‘And as soon as I saw a pattern, I knew it was Blane. I called the . police in Atlanta and told them, 'Let me explain how this is all going . to go down.'’ During his . career, Detective Mason became something of an expert on Nordahl and . nicknames him ‘The Silver Thief’ or the ‘Thief to the Stars,’. ‘It's . his addiction,’ Det. Mason said. ‘He doesn't do drugs or drink alcohol. But needs to steal. He feeds off it. He needs to prove he's better than . the police.’ He explained . that robbing silver also had its advantages with many victims not . realising they have been robbed until closer to the holidays when it’s . time to take out the good silverware. He . would usually target expensive homes and look for leads in architecture . magazines that showcased the homes of the rich and famous. Thief to the stars: Amongst his 300 burglaries Nordahl stole silver from the homes of Billy Joel and Ivana Trump . The . retired detective helped several police departments with their . enquiries pointing out similarities in the cases such as the same way in . which the suspect always cut holes in windows, so he could crawl in. Then he would snatch high-quality silverware, leaving behind less valuable silver and pieces of jewellery. Sheriff's deputies in Hilliard, Florida arrested Nordahl on Monday and charged him with felony burglary and conspiracy. After a short chase, he was cuffed and officers called Detective Mason to let him know the news. ‘They told him, 'Blane, there's someone on the phone.' When they told . him it was Lonnie Mason, he just buried his head in his knees,’ Detective Mason said. ‘I . know Blane,’ Mason said. ‘He can't help himself. In the past I tried . helping him get a job. The guy is brilliant and could do anything he . chose. But he chose being a thief.’ Although . Nordahl was arrested in Florida, he is expected to be extradited first . to Atlanta before authorities in Tennessee and South Carolina press . charges.","Blane Nordahl, 51, is accused of stealing millions of dollars in silver from stately homes .

The Army psychiatrist who faces the death penalty for the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood has told jurors that 'the evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter'. Major Nidal Malik Hasan on Tuesday began his court martial delivering his own opening statements that lasted less than two minutes. He told jurors: 'The evidence presented during the trial will only show one side.' 'We the Mujahideen are imperfect Muslims trying to establish the perfect religion in the land of the supreme god.' Scroll down for video . Hasan, shown here in a courtroom sketch from today, is acting as his own lawyer and said in his brief opening statement, 'the evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter. The dead bodies will show that war is an ugly thing' Admitted shooter: Major Nidal Hasan, seen here in 2010, is representing himself in his own defense as he faces the death penalty for allegedly killing 13 people on Fort Hood Army base in 2009 . Hasan said 'the evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter. The dead bodies will show that war is an ugly thing.' Hasan's shocking opening statement came after prosecutors revealed that he had planned to 'kill as many soldiers as he could'. Prosecutors teased the fact that Major Nidal Malik Hasan picked the date of the attack — November 5, 2009 — for a specific reason but left the packed courtroom waiting for an explanation. Col. Steve Henricks gave his opening statement at the Texas base, which was under heavy security at the trial got underway Tuesday morning. The trial will turn into a faceoff between the gunman and his victims since the suspect is representing himself and will be tasked with questioning his former peers who were once his targets. Hasan has never denied carrying out the attack, and the facts of the case are mostly settled. On the witness stand will be many of the more than 30 people who were wounded, plus dozens of others who were inside the post's Soldier Readiness Processing Center, where some service members were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. High security: All cars are being checked for explosives as Fort Hood is operating under extreme caution during the trial . Reeling: The 2009 attack was the deadliest mass shooting ever on a U.S. military installation . They said they saw Hasan shout 'Allahu akbar!' — Arabic for 'God is great!' — and open fire on unarmed fellow soldiers. Hasan is charged with numerous counts of murder and attempted murder for the attack that left 13 people dead. -- Staff Sgt. Shawn Manning, who is expected to be called to testify as a witness to the attack . Over the next several weeks, he is expected to deliver an opening statement, to question witnesses and possibly present his own evidence, but questions abound about how the trial will play out given his role in both the attack and the trial. How will Hasan question his victims? How will victims respond? How will his health hold up? Hasan, who was shot in the back by officers responding to the attack, is now paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair. He requires 15- to 20-minute stretching breaks about every four hours, and he has to lift himself off his wheelchair for about a minute every half hour to avoid developing sores. Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford, who was wounded, is expected to testify. He said he looked forward to seeing Hasan, in a way. 'I'm not going to dread anything. That's a sign of fear,' Lunsford said. Connected: The government has said that Hasan, a U.S.-born Muslim, had sent more than a dozen emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical U.S.-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen . 'That man strikes no fear in my heart. He strikes no fear in my family. What he did to me was bad. But the biggest mistake that he made was I survived. So he will see me again.' But Staff Sgt. Shawn Manning said he dreaded the expected confrontation. 'I have to keep my composure and not go after the guy,' said Manning, a mental health specialist who was preparing to deploy to Afghanistan with Hasan. 'I'm not afraid of him, obviously. He's a paralyzed guy in a wheelchair, but it's sickening that he's still living and breathing.' The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, told jurors to prepare for a trial that could last several months. On Tuesday, guards stood watch with long assault rifles outside the courthouse. A long row of shipping freight containers, stacked three high, created a fence around the building, which was almost entirely hidden by 15-foot-tall stacks of heavy, shock-absorbing barriers that extend to the roofline. Hasan's defense strategy remains unclear. He wanted to argue that he carried out the shooting in 'defense of others' — namely members of the Taliban fighting in Afghanistan — but Osborn, the judge, denied that strategy. Clear wounds: Retired Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford was one of the three dozen injured in the attack, seen here pointing to one of his wounds. He is expected to testify in the trial . Still standing: Retired U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Shawn Manning, who still carries two bullets from the shooting in his body, is seen holding a picture from the memorial that was dedicated to the 13 people who died . The government has said that Hasan, a U.S.-born Muslim, had sent more than a dozen emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical U.S.-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen in 2011. John Galligan, Hasan's former lead attorney, said Monday that he still keeps in touch with Hasan but wasn't sure what he would say Tuesday, if anything. Hasan has indicated recently that he still wants his views to be heard. He has released statements to media outlets about his views on the Islamic legal code known as Sharia and how it conflicts with American democracy. If he is convicted and sentenced to death, it will most likely be decades before he makes it to the death chamber, if at all. The military has not executed an active-duty soldier since 1961. Five men are on the military death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, but none is close to an execution date. Different circumstances: Hasan requires 15- to 20-minute stretching breaks about every four hours, and he has to lift himself off his wheelchair for about a minute every half hour to avoid developing sores . Authorities in the military justice system have also struggled to avoid reversed sentences on appeal. Eleven of the 16 death sentences handed down by military juries in the last 30 years have been overturned, according to an academic study and court records. That's one reason why prosecutors and the military judge have been careful leading up to trial, said Geoffrey Corn, a professor at the South Texas College of Law and former military lawyer. 'The public looks and says, “This is an obviously guilty defendant. What's so hard about this?”' Corn said. 'What seems so simple is in fact relatively complicated.'","Maj.

Cramps: A Russian MP has proposed a new law giving women two paid days off a month for while they are on their periods . Women's rights activists in Russia have reacted with anger to proposals to give women two days paid leave a month when they are on their periods. Mikhail Degtyaryov, a member of the nationalist LDPR party, wrote on his website that he had proposed the draft law to increase the protection of women at the workplace. 'During that period, most women experience psychological and physiological discomfort,' said Mr Degtyaryov, 32, who is married with two sons. 'The pain for the fair sex is often so intense that it is necessary to call an ambulance.' Human rights campaigners have already dismissed Mr Degtyaryov's idea as sexist. 'This argument is obviously improper, unreasonable and nothing close to being serious,' said Anna Sobko, a lawyer at Memorial, Russia's oldest human rights group. Marina Pisklakova-Parker, head of women's group Anna Center, said the proposal was absurd. 'If we are seriously debating women's efficiency at work during menstruation, we should also consider how fit for work men are after a drinking bout,' she said. Rights activists said they did not see the Kremlin's hand behind the proposal. But opponents of the Russian government say there has been a drift towards more conservatism attitudes in Russian politics since Putin returned to the presidency last year and started courting the resurgent Russian Orthodox Church. Parliament has since then enacted what critics see as a series of repressive laws, including one banning 'homosexual propaganda' which has been widely condemned in the West.","Nationalist politician Mikhail Degtyaryov claims period pains are often so intense women need an ambulance .

A professor at Boston University is suing Apple for patent infringement and is calling for the products to be banned in the U.S. Lecturer Theodore D. Moustakas claims he designed the thin gallium nitride film that Apple uses on the semiconductor chips inside its iPhone, iPad and MacBook Air in 1995. He is now also seeking financial damages from the tech firm. A professor at Boston University is suing Apple for patent infringement. The lecturer claims he designed the thin gallium nitride films used on the semiconductor chips inside the iPhone, pictured, iPad and MacBook Air in 1995 and wants the products banned in the U.S. He is also seeking financial damages . Gallium Nitride (GaN) is a semiconductor material that can stand high levels of heat and thermal conductivity. Electricity can be passed through semiconductor materials from one place to another. This is why it is used in semiconductor chips in phones, tablets and laptops. In its pure form, GaN resists cracking and can be used as a thin film on top of various materials. The lawsuit, filed by professor of electrical computing and engineering at the university on 2 July, said: 'Several of the Defendant's products, including the iPhone 5, iPad and MacBook Air include a gallium nitride thin film semiconductor device claimed by the '738 patent and thus infringe one or more claims the of the '738 patent.' It asks that the 'Defendant provide to the University an accounting of all gains, profits andadvantages derived by Defendant' s infringement of the '738 patent, and that the University beawarded damages adequate to compensate them for the wrongful infringement.' Moustakas and the university also want to be 'awarded any other supplemental damages and interest onall damages, including, but not limited to attorney fees.' Plus, the university asks that the court bans Apple from 'making,  selling, offering for sale, distributing and/or using prodcuts that infringe the patent' across the whole of America. The professor claims he invented the film in 1995 and the '738 patent was filed in November 1997. The patent, called 'Highly insulating monocrystalline gallium nitride thin films' describes the method used to make these thin films and lists some of the uses for them. This includes using the films as a semiconductor material in devices. This image is a cross-sectional view of a growth chamber used to create the gallium nitride films. Professor Theodore D. Moustakas patented the process behind the chips in 1997 and claims Apple ripped off his designs . Last month a court in the U.S banned the sale Apple products - including the iPhone 4 and the iPad and iPad 2 3G models after an official ruling claimed the devices breach Samsung patents. Apple was given 60 days to stop selling the products but is appealing the decision, which ruled that Apple copied Samsung's 3G technology in its devices. In 2011 a group of nearly 27,000 South Koreans sued Apple for £15.8million over what they claim were 'privacy . violations' from the collection of iPhone user location information. Each person in the suit sought one million won (£568) in damages,. At the time, the groups attorney Kim Hyeong-seok said they were targeting Apple and its South Korean unit to 'protect privacy' rights. The South Korean government had previously fined the company £1800 for privacy infringement.","Professor claims he invented the film used on semiconductor chips in 1995 .

Britain's top directors have an average pension worth £260,000 a year, an investigation reveals today. One executive is on an annual deal of £1million, according to a report that appears to expose the widening gulf between ordinary workers’ pensions and those enjoyed by bosses. It found a director of a company in the FTSE index of the UK’s 100 biggest publicly listed firms has a fund worth £259,947 a year, while the average worker has an annual company pension worth £10,452. The average director of a FTSE 100 company has a fund worth £259,947 while the average worker has an annual company pension of £10,452 . The biggest winner is David Brennan, the ousted boss of the drugs giant AstraZeneca, who has retired on a pension worth £1million a year – 37 times the average salary of a full-time employee. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, which commissioned the report, attacked Britain’s corporate elite for enjoying pay and bonuses ‘beyond common decency’ while the number of private sector workers saving into a company pension fell to 2.9million, the lowest level since records began in 1953. ‘But not content with grabbing an ever larger slice of the UK’s earnings pie, they are adding to the country’s growing inequality with platinum-plated pensions,’ she said. The bosses of two banking giants bailed out by the taxpayer received big pension windfalls. Antonio Horta-Osorio of Lloyds was given a retirement contribution last year worth £549,000, while Stephen Hester of RBS took £420,000 – paid in cash. David Brennan, former chief executive of AstraZeneca (left), has an annual pension worth £1million while Peter Voser, Shell chief executive, (right) has a fund of £882,770 a year . Frank Chapman, chief executive of BG Group, has a pension worth £850,140 a year . Four of the five bosses with the biggest pension deals work for oil companies, with Sir Frank Chapman of oil and gas firm BG Group, Peter Voser of Royal Dutch Shell, and BP’s Byron Grote and Bob Dudley all on deals worth more than £800,000 a year. It comes as official figures show the number of private sector workers saving into a company pension has collapsed to 2.9million, the lowest level since records began in 1953. Experts warn a generation of Britons will be ‘unable to afford to retire’ after a lifetime of hard work as the number of people with a pension has ‘shrivelled at a seemingly unstoppable rate.’ In the 1960s, a peak of more than eight million private sector workers had a company pension scheme, but the numbers have declined at a dangerous pace ever since. The TUC report found a director of a FTSE index company has an average pension of £259,947 a year while the average worker has an annual company pension worth £10,452 . Overall, the TUC’s report also highlights how directors can typically retire on a full pension at the age of 60 at a time when the State pension age is rising. At present, a man cannot get his full State pension until the age of 65, and women’s State pension age is being gradually increased to the same age.  Both will eventually rise to 67 and beyond. The average ‘pension pot’ of a FTSE 100 director with a ‘defined benefit’ pension is £4.74million, a rise of £41,000 over the last year, according to the TUC. The research is based on the pension entitlements of 294 directors which appear in their company’s latest annual reports, published each year by FTSE 100 firms. The Government is desperate to stop the rot in Britain’s pensions system. Last October, new rules were introduced forcing bosses to pay into a pension for their workers for the first time. Up to nine million workers will be enrolled into a pension by 2018, the deadline for all firms, including start-ups, to have signed up their workers. Since October, around 1.4million workers have been automatically enrolled into a pension scheme. Less than 10 per cent have subsequently ‘opted out’.","TUC report shows gulf between ordinary workers' pensions and bosses .

Penn State University's ex-president and two former top school administrators have been ordered to stand trial on charges accusing them of a cover-up in the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal. Prosecutors showed enough evidence during a two-day preliminary hearing to warrant a full criminal court trial for ex-president Graham Spanier, former vice-president Gary Schultz and ex-athletic director Tim Curley, Judge William Wenner said. The Judge described it as a 'tragic day for Penn State University' at a hearing on Tuesday. Trial: Former Penn State president Graham Spanier, above, Gary Schultz, below left, and Tim Curley, below right, will face charges of covering up a child sex abuse scandal . State prosecutors alleged that the university officials failed to tell police about sexual abuse allegations involving Sandusky, the university's assistant football coach, and then tried to cover up what they knew about it. All three have said that they are innocent and were not aware of the allegation against Sandusky in 2001. They said they had believed that Sandusky and the boy were engaged in nothing more than horseplay in a university locker room shower. The 68-year-old was convicted last year of 45 counts of child sexual abuse. He still maintains his innocence and is appealing the 30 to 60-year state prison term. Mike McQueary, a football team graduate assistant in 2001, testified that he saw Sandusky and a boy engaged in a sex act in the locker room shower and, within days, reported it to coach Joe Paterno, as well as to Curley and Schultz. Charges: A poster of the three men who are now due to stand trial was displayed at a news conference in November last year . However, 59-year-old Curley, and Schultz, 63, claimed that Mr McQueary never reported that the encounter was sexual in nature, and Spanier, 65, has said that the pair never told him about any sort of sex abuse of a boy. The three were charged with perjury, . obstruction, endangering the welfare of children, failure to properly . report suspected abuse and conspiracy. Those charges include allegations of hiding evidence from investigators and lying to the grand jury. According to CNN, e-mails found during a Penn State internal investigation into Sandusky led, in part, to the charges against the officials. The e-mails show that the men decided to tell Sandusky to stop bringing children from his charity to the locker room after an incident in 2001. Their 'conspiracy of silence' allowed Sandusky to abuse at least three more children on campus between 2001 and 2009, Chief Deputy Attorney General Bruce Beemer told the court, according to The Morning Call. Curley . and Schultz were initially charged in November 2011, when Sandusky was . arrested, and they were accused of perjury and failure to properly . report the incident. Jailed: Assistant coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted of 45 counts of child sex abuse . Abuse: It is claimed the three men failed to take action after being told that Sandusky engaged in a sex act with a boy in a locker room shower at the university . Spanier was forced out as president at that time. A year later, he was charged with covering up a complaint about Sandusky, and additional charges were filed against Curley and Schultz. Spanier remains a faculty member on administrative leave. Paterno was fired from his position as coach and died in January last year. A date for the trial has not yet been set, but an attorney for Schultz predicted it may not be held until March next year.

Conspiracy: Friends, family and the girlfriend of Mohammed Imran Amjad tried to stop his child sex victim giving evidence . A social services worker accessed the records of a child raped in a drugs den as part of a wider conspiracy to collapse the trial of an alleged paedophile ring. Mahdiya Khan, 21, a secretary for Lancashire County Council, printed off 'extremely sensitive' data on the girl and handed it to her boyfriend, who was a defendant in the case. A gang had been accused of systematically abusing the 14-year-old, and family and friends of the ringleader then offered her cash and showered her with gifts to persuade her to change her statement and say the sex was consensual. The girl and her loved-ones were also threatened in a case that police said today was 'horrendous'. The trial of the six men came to court last year but it collapsed after one day when the girl, now 16, refused to give evidence. A retrial was then called in March, but this also ended abruptly when the alleged victim said that the sex had been consensual. Only one one man, Mohammed Imran Amjad, 26, was convicted as he had admitted three counts of child abduction and one of . sexual activity with a child. Amjad bore the 'greatest responsibility for the corruption and abuse of the victim in this case'. Prosecutor Alaric Bassano told Burnley Crown Court last year: 'It was him who took . her on many occasions to the house and him who assisted, encouraged and . incited others to rape and sexually assault this girl. 'On one occasion, he raped the girl himself. Over a period of time he subdued her will and coerced her into submission. 'The girl was groomed over a period of time and on many occasions she was taken to a house in Brierfield (near Burnley). 'That . house was used as a den at which young men attended and brought or . invited girls and young women in order to drink alcohol, take drugs and . engage in sex'. After he admitted the sex crimes, Amjad was jailed for four years and three . months. But his case has since sparked four more convictions of people, including his partner, cousin and brother, who had tried to impede justice. Collapse: Three . of the defendants are seen leaving Burnley Crown Court last year after the first trial was ended abruptly when the alleged victim refused to give evidence - five out of six were acquitted . As well as the crimes of Mahdiya Khan, Amjad's cousin Waqas Khalid, 19, followed the child sex victim, and told her that she and her mother would be raped and their house 'blown up', according to The Times. It came from an investigation by the paper's Chief Investigative Reporter Andrew Norfolk. Amjad's friend Qasim Hussain, 20, dictated a note for the girl which said: 'I didn't have sex with any . of the boys who's in court next month. I didn't get raped' as part of a campaign to get her to change her evidence. Amjad's brother Furqan Amjad, 23,  bombarded the girl with hundreds phone calls and text messages in a fortnight, and even paid for her mobile phone credit as part of a 'charm offensive' before the case went to court. In one message he urged her 'have some courage' and she then refused to give evidence. Controversial: A second trial at Manchester Crown Court later collapsed when the girl changed her statement, but Mohammed Imran AmJad had pleaded guilty . All have now been convicted of their part in the conspiracy, the Crown Prosecution Service told MailOnline. Miss Khan was jailed for eight months last year after pleading guilty to five counts of unauthorised access to computer material. She was also sacked by Lancashire County Council. Waqas Khalid admitted one count of witness intimidation and was fined £300, ordered to pay costs of £250, and £200 compensation to the victim. Furqan . Amjad got 15 months in prison for perverting the course of . justice and Qasim Hussain was . found guilty of perverting the course of Justice and has been told he should expect a 'lengthy' jail term when he is sentenced this week. Lancashire Detective Chief Inspector Sion Hall, from Lancashire Constabulary, told MailOnline: 'This was a horrendous case where a vulnerable girl was threatened and manipulated after being put through significant sexual abuse. 'It is difficult to bring cases to court especially when individuals work to undermine the process. The witness was got at by a group who tried everything to persuade her not to give evidence . 'Sadly attempts to collapse a trial in this way are not unique'.","Mohammed Imran Amjad, 26, admitted a series of child sex offences .

The festive season is generally considered to be one of the busiest and most stressful times of the year. Finding time to buy presents, cooking a Christmas dinner for the whole family and the nagging worries about how much the whole lot costs can leave some with their fair share of anxiety at this time of year. But despite the tiredness, family tensions and financial pressure, nearly half of men think women exaggerate the stressfulness of Christmas, according to a new study. A third of men think they could do a better job of organising Christmas than their partner . But 42 per cent of women say hosting Christmas Day is their most stressful job of the year, while 85 per cent say men don't understand how much work it takes . What's more, an antagonistic third of men reckon they could do a better job than their partner if they were in charge of the festive preparations. But, four in ten British women would not trust their other half to execute essential Christmas tasks, whereas they'd get it done right first time. And a staggering 85 per cent of women claim men don't understand how much work goes into creating the perfect Christmas, nor the stress it causes. The study showed, though, that 42 per cent of women said that hosting Christmas Day is their most stressful job of the year. A further two in five women worry their hosting skills on Christmas Day will be criticised by family and friends. The study into stress at Christmas revealed that keeping guests entertained, planning meals, and getting embarrassed by a partner or child are the biggest worries. Stress can come from all sorts of sources at this time of year, including braving the crowds searching for those last minute presents . The research, by hotel chain Travelodge, found the week leading up to Christmas to be the worst for sleep throughout the year. Psychologist Corinne Sweet said: 'The stress of Christmas can be avoided if people lower their expectations of it. 'I would suggest taking time out from a busy schedule while having a nap can do wonders if you've not had much sleep. 'People will also benefit from having some quiet 'me-time' every once in a while.' Financial worries can also come to the fore at this time of year as people bid to show their loved ones how much they care . Nearly half of Brits will miss 21 hours of sleep this week in the lead up to Christmas Day, according to a new study. As we stay up late to wrap gifts and attend festive parties, 45 per cent of us will have to live on just five hours shut-eye each day, while the recommended average is eight. Christmas stress means four in ten sleep-deprived adults will also get up an hour early each day this week to complete festive preparations. Dr Chris Idzikowski, of The Edinburgh Sleep Centre, said: 'It is important that Brits try to keep a regular sleep pattern in the lead up to Christmas.'Sleepiness is as dangerous as drinking and people have to be very careful if they're driving or doing anything else that requires full attention.'","Four in ten women would not trust their partners to carry out essential tasks .

It was a permanent reminder of one of the First World War's bloodiest battlefields, a scale model of the opposing lines created in an English field for the education of Allied troops. Now a dig to uncover the model built by German prisoners of war which long since has become covered by earth and foliage is set to start. Archaeologists will begin charting the site, the only example of its kind left in the UK, which was planned out in painstaking detail by troops returned from the Battle of Messines on the Western Front, fought in June 1917. Archaeologists will begin charting the site of the Staffordshire model of the Battle of Messines, Belgium, which was planned out in painstaking detail by troops returned from the war . Experts said the terrain model was built . not only as a training aid for other soldiers at Brocton Camp, in . Staffordshire, but in recognition at the horrific toll of slaughter the . battle - fought around the landmark Messines ridge - took on the . brigade. The ridge formed an anchor in the German front lines but the week-long offensive of infantry attack, aerial bombardment and heavy shelling resulted in an Allied victory with four Victoria Crosses awarded to Empire soldiers for bravery during the fight. The terrible human cost of the battle ran to 50,000 men killed, wounded or missing across both sides. The battle was fought in the build-up to the much larger and far bloodier Passchendaele offensive which would begin in July of that year. Recreation: The battle field was recreated by veterans as well as German prisoners of war in the battle's aftermath. It was one of the First World War's bloodiest battlefields . During the construction of the model battlefield, the Army brought in its Corps field bakers to feed those involved in painstakingly rebuilding the war-zone . Staffordshire County Council, in a project funded by Natural England, is going to make a record of the model for future generations before re-covering the site on Cannock Chase in October. Councillor Philip Atkins, county council leader, said Staffordshire was proud of its military heritage as the home of the National Memorial Arboretum and now was the right time to carry out the dig with the centenary of the war's outbreak falling next year. He said: 'We see ourselves very much as custodians of the land and of the memories it holds, and this is a wonderful opportunity to bring the site back to life.' An Officers Clubhouse was even erected for the project at Brocton Camp, Cannock Chase, as the reconstruction of the war-field began to take shape . The model was built by German prisoners of war, supervised by the New Zealanders, and then rendered in concrete. It includes small-scale reconstructions of Messines village's buildings, including its church, together with trench positions, railway lines, roads, and accurate contours of the surrounding terrain. Mr Atkins said: 'The idea to build a scale model was a stroke of genius and undoubtedly played a huge role in preventing the deaths of thousands of more men. Then: Men were set to work digging trenches in the field designated as a model for the battle zone in Staffordhsire . Now: Archaeologists will have their work cut out for them to return the overgrown Cannock Chase area to its former replica model of the Messines terrain battlefield . 'Due to the location, scale and fragile nature of the model it is impossible for it to be moved or left uncovered, but for a brief moment in time we all be able to share with the nation, memories of a piece of Staffordshire which helped change the course of history.' Preparatory work on the site is starting today with the dig taking place next week. The Battle of Messines took place on the Western Front in June 1917 in Belgium, around the village of Mesen . The . Battle of Messines was a major offensive conducted by the British . Second Army, under the command of General Herbert Plumer, on the Western . Front near the village of Messines, Belgium. Six . army Corps were involved in the offensive - three carried out the . attack, two remained on the northern flank and one was available at . short notice if needed. The . offensive forced the German Army to move reserves to . Flanders from the Arras and Aisne fronts, which relieved pressure on the . French Army. Morale among French troops was low after the Neville offensive in the preceding months failed to achieve its aims. The . tactical objective of the attack at Messines was to capture the German . defences along the length of the ridge, which ran from Ploegsteert Wood . in the south through Messines and Wytschaete to Mount Sorrel, to deprive . the German Fourth Army of the high ground south of Ypres. Troops from the British Second Army fought in the Battle of Messines, . which took place along a ridge running south from Ypres. Pictured, men . marching to trenches near Ypres in October 1914 . The . British defences were positioned behind the ridge and back areas . further north, from which the British intended to conduct the 'Northern . Operation' - to advance to Passchendaele Ridge, then capture the Belgian . coast up to the Dutch frontie. They included numerous divisions from Australia and New Zealand. The . German Fourth Army divisions of Gruppe Wijtschate held the ridge; they . were later reinforced by a division from Gruppe Ypern. The battle began with the detonation of 19 mines, which devastated the German front line defences. The . forces then followed with a creeping barrage, 700 yards (640m) deep, . which allowed the advancing British troops to secure the ridge with . support from tanks, cavalry patrols and aircraft. British attacks from 8–14 June advanced the new front line beyond the former German line. The . Battle of Messines is considered a prelude to the much larger Third .

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Bashar al-Assad 'a two-bit dictator' on Monday during an hour-long conference call with Democratic congressmen - saying Syria's president will 'continue to act with impunity' if President Obama's request for limited air strikes fails to win approval. And speaking to reporters after a meeting with President Obama at the White House, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona said that if Congress defeats a resolution calling for military intervention, it would be 'catastrophic, because it would undermine the credibility of the United States and the president of the United States.' South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who joined McCain and Obama on Monday afternoon, called Syria ‘a cancer that's growing in the region' and said Republicans 'don't want endless war... We want sustainable security.’ About 125 of the House's 200 Democrats were on the call with Kerry, a Democratic aide told MailOnline. Lawmakers also heard from National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Director of National intelligence James Clapper. Scroll down for video . Credibility: Republican senator John McCain, left, accompanied by Sen. Lindsey Graham, told reporters it would undermine America's international standing if Congress threw out strikes . A Democratic staff source said Kerry referred repeatedly to a 'Munich moment' faced by the United States, referring to the September 30, 1938 Munich Pact. That agreement, signed by Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Neville Chamberlain and French premier Edouard Daladier, essentially ceded Czechoslovakia to Germany in hopes of securing peace. Politico reported Monday that Kerry assured legislators that Israel supports the concept of a U.S. military strike on Syria. Hawk: McCain had earlier said that Syrai's dictator Assad would be 'euphoric' over Obama's decision to wait for a vote . Crisis talks: President Obama and Vice-President Biden meet with Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Advisor Susan Rice to discuss Syria on Sunday . The Democratic aide also said Minnesota Rep. Rick Nolan openly challenged Kerry on the nature of the Obama administration's evidence that the Assad regime had used sarin gas against rebels inside Syria. 'This is going to be another Vietnam,' Nolan reportedly said. 'I don't want to hear any talk like that,' the source said Kerry snapped back. Kerry served in Vietnam as captain of a naval 'swift boat' whose other crewmen challenged the basis for his service medals when he ran for president in 2004. More...

U.S. and Israel carry out missile test in the Mediterranean as two rockets are fired into the sea . The secretary of state also famously served as chief spokesman for Vietnam Veterans Against the War, testifying against U.S. military involvement there during a 1971 hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 'There is nothing in South Vietnam which could happen that realistically threatens the United States of America,' Kerry said then. 'And to attempt to justify the loss of one American life in Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos by linking such loss to the preservation of freedom, which those misfits supposedly abuse, is to us the height of criminal hypocrisy, and it is that kind of hypocrisy which we feel has torn this country apart.' Contact: Barack Obama called members of the House of Representatives to rally support . Kerry later served as chairman of that committee, and it voted to approve his nomination to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state earlier this year. On Tuesday he will return, along with Hagel, to testify publicly in the latest salvo of the public relations war over U.S. involvement in Syria. The 2:30 p.m. event will be the first in a series of hearings in advance of congressional votes on a resolution endorsing military intervention in the war-torn country. Political insiders see the hearing as one piece of a White House public persuasion effort, which included Monday's conference call. Call for action: Protesters demanding military action shout over those opposing it at joint rallies in Washington DC on Sunday . Kerry and Hagel will return on Wednesday morning for a 9:00 a.m. closed-door briefing with the same Senate panel, suggesting that Tuesday's public hearing will be only a partial display of the Obama administration's case for air strikes and other military action. Three hours later, Kerry will appear before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs to make a similar case. California GOP Rep. Ed Royce, who chairs the committee, said Monday afternoon that 'the president's proposed military response to the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime demands thorough and deliberate congressional consideration.’ 'This hearing will allow for the Administration to publicly make its case and explain its plans to Congress and the American people.' Innocents: According to U.S. estimates, of the 1,429 killed in the attack, 426 were children . Responsibility: French agents say Assad's regime is behind the nerve gas attack in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus on August 21 . The White House’s PR campaign will also include calls from the White House to pivotal members of the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle, following the in-person meeting Monday with McCain and Graham, two influential Republicans whom Obama has won over. 'In all calls and briefings,' an Obama administration aide told The Hill, 'we will be making the same fundamental case: the failure to take action against Assad unravels the deterrent impact of the international norm against chemical weapons use, and it risks emboldening Assad and his key allies – Hezbollah and Iran – who will see that there are no consequences for such a flagrant violation of an international norm.' Obama himself will travel to Sweden on Tuesday night, but not before meeting at the White House with the chairmen and ranking minority members of the intelligence, armed services and foreign affairs committees in tboth the House and Senate.","McCain is one of the loudest critics of the administration's handling of Syria .

A comedian has become a virtual globetrotter after embarking on a mission to talk to one person from every country in the world. Mark Malkoff has managed to contact more than 80 per cent of the world's nations via Skype - including the secretive state of North Korea. Now he has channelled his surreal experiences into a YouTube video charting a manic three-day computer sessions during which he spent 27 hours talking to people from all corners of the world. Scroll down for video . Mission: Comedian Mark Malkoff has spoken to people in 162 different countries using Skype . Virtual tourism: Many of those the comedian spoke to showed him local landmarks during their conversation . Global conversation: Nearly everyone he spoke to was a total stranger who got in touch via social media . Mr Malkoff, who is based in New York and is known for his online videos and television appearances, announced the start of the project on his Facebook page earlier this year. He immediately got a warm response from his 3,600 followers, offering to put him in touch with their friends living in obscure countries around the world. The 36-year-old was dependent on the generosity of strangers, who were happy to spend 10 minutes talking to a man they'd never met for the project, designed to celebrate Skype's 10th anniversary. In the end, he managed to contact 162 different countries - including war-torn states such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Egypt. WATCH MORE OF THE VIDEO ON THE MARK MALKOFF YOUTUBE CHANNEL . Striking: Mr Malkoff was impressed with the futuristic skyline of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates . Playful: Mr Malkoff connected with people around the world by making funny faces at them . Remote: He even found contacts in troubled countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria . 'I wanted to show how the world is getting smaller and show how technology is bringing us together,' he said. 'I put out a call on Facebook and Twitter to find someone to Skype with in every single country - and I was overwhelmed by the response. 'I didn't know most of these people - I just said, ""Can I call you?"" 'I was touched that people wanted to let me into their homes and share their family and their country with me. People are so proud of their countries and really wanted to show me the best of them.' Of all the many conversations Mr Malkoff had, the one he which he found the most 'meaningful' was with Ireland, because of the extraordinary show which the country put on for him. 'The person I talked to arranged for an Irish pub to play for me,' he said. Joke: Mr Malkoff boasted that his wife was Snooki - but his new Ethiopian friend did not recognise her from MTV reality show Jersey Shore . Tour guide: The comedian liked to conduct his calls near New York landmarks such as Times Square, pictured . Unexpected: When he was talking to Costa Rica, the comedian came face to face with a chicken . Connection: Mr Malkoff was able to establish a bond with almost anyone through a shared love of pets . Another memorable experience was talking to North Korea, when a woman who runs tours to the country agreed to chat to him while she watched a football match. 'I was determined to speak to someone in North Korea, because so many people told me it couldn't be done,' he said. 'It was definitely the most difficult call to arrange, but it was among my favourites. 'When I called China, they answered the call in Tiananmen Square - that was amazing. I got to see so many places that I would never have been able to go to all around the world in real time. 'I answered as many calls as I could in New York City, and showed people the Brooklyn Bridge or Times Square - and I think people liked chatting to me just as much as I enjoyed chatting to them. 'Most people managed to speak English, and I know some Spanish, so I managed to speak to most people, but there were a few where we just smiled and waved at each other and showed each other our surroundings. 'I got to see a lot of pets - and people wanted to see my pets too.' Victory! Perhaps the hardest country of all to contact is North Korea, but Mr Malkoff managed it . Family: The virtual globetrotter has been delighted to connect with people around the world . Exhausted: But Mr Malkoff is still keen to get in touch with the final 31 countries on the list . Mr Malkoff never even saw the face of one of his new friends - when he called Algeria, he spoke to a Muslim woman wearing a burqa which covered up her features. But the most surreal conversation came when he needed to tick off the U.S. - and Skyped his wife as she was sitting in the next room. While his careful planning allowed him to carry out the project with extraordinary success, it was not without a few mishaps. When he phoned Indonesia, he found his correspondent in total darkness as he had slipped up and called in the middle of the night. 'That was the hard thing, calculating the different time changes,' he said. Mr Malkoff has concluded the project for now - but he still has 31 countries to go, and is considering restarting in order to collect a full set. 'I might do it, just because I had such an amazing time talking to people,' he said.","Mark Malkoff, 36, travelled the world virtually from his New York home .

He may have become the world’s most expensive footballer, but Gareth Bale has by his side a devoted childhood sweetheart who shuns the high life. Unfortunately, however, it seems her father may have rather less  modest tastes. Martin Rhys-Jones, father of Bale’s girlfriend Emma, is on remand in an American jail accused of a global financial fraud. Martin Rhys-Jones (pictured with a woman on his Twitter page), the father of Gareth Bale's girlfriend Emma, is on remand in an American jail accused of a global financial fraud . Rhys-Jones, the father of Emma (pictured as Bale was unveiled at Real Madrid) could face up to 30 years in prison if he is found guilty and a fine of £160,000 . He was extradited to the US on charges of helping to mastermind a ‘boiler room’ scam that allegedly conned millions from unwitting investors. If found guilty, he could face up to 30 years in prison and a fine of £160,000. Rhys-Jones, 49, was charged alongside 11 others in a New York court with  conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. He is accused of running a telemarketing scam from offices in Barcelona between 2006 and 2009 that duped victims into buying expensive shares that were almost worthless. Rhys-Jones set up business in the Spanish city – where there is a ferocious footballing rivalry with Real Madrid, which has just signed Bale for £300,000 a week – in 2005 after separating from his wife, Suzanne, in Cardiff. The father-of-five is accused of organising a series of ‘boiler room’ scams which involved cold-calling people in the UK and Canada to sell them low-value shares for high prices. Rhys-Jones is unlikely to have met his granddaughter Alba Violet Bale as he would not have able to leave Spain last year while fighting extradition to the US . Many of Bale's relatives were at the Santiago Bernabeu as he was unveiled by Real Madrid . Investigators claim Rhys-Jones got staff . to generate false press releases claiming share prices were of a much . higher value than they were being traded. He is alleged to have hired six people to make the fraudulent calls, offering them free rent in Barcelona and commission for sales. US investigators say the sales team would not tell customers that the stocks were restricted, meaning they could not be easily sold on the open market. The indictment states that when customers were eventually sent share certificates ‘the value of the stock had dropped to nearly nothing’. More than £3.2million was invested by unwitting customers in the scheme before the money was transferred to bank accounts in New York, Spain, the UK and Switzerland, prosecutors say. They have accused Rhys-Jones of laundering money through an Abbey National branch in the Channel Islands, along with banks in Barcelona and Germany. Gareth Bale became the world's most expensive footballer when he was bought by Real for £85million . The US probe is being run by the Homeland Security Investigations, Internal Revenue Service and Immigration and Customs. Rhys-Jones . was arrested by the Spanish National Police’s fugitive squad last . September, but was extradited to New York only in June. He is now in a . federal prison in Buffalo, New York, awaiting a trial expected to start . next year. As he would have been unable to leave Spain last year while fighting extradition to the US, it is highly likely that he is yet to meet his granddaughter, Alba Violet Bale, who is 11 months old. Rhys-Jones posted about his business ventures and life in Barcelona on both his Twitter and Facebook social networking accounts. It is not clear whether daughter Emma, 23, will move to Spain with Bale following his £85.3million transfer to Real Madrid. Friends say the shy family girl is close to mother Suzanne and prefers life at her £150,000 three-bedroom former council home in Cardiff. Rhys-Jones married Suzanne in South Glamorgan, Wales, in 1988 and they went on to have five children. Suzanne now uses her maiden name of McMurray but it is not known if the pair have divorced. Bale was training with Wales yesterday. His spokesman said he was aware of Rhys-Jones' situation . Emma and Bale, who became childhood . sweethearts at Whitchurch High School in Cardiff, carried out a . long-distance relationship for eight years after Bale’s moves to . Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur and she moved into his Essex mansion . only two years ago. The notoriously private pair have tended to eschew public appearances together in the past. Commenting on Rhys-Jones’s case, James Spero, Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Buffalo, New York, said: ‘These criminals demonstrated a callous disregard for the hard earned money of individuals who thought that they were legitimately investing in their futures. They will now have to account for their actions before a court of law.’ Speaking from her four-bedroom detached home in Cardiff last night, Rhys-Jones’s mother Grace, 71, said: ‘I’ve been told not to talk about this. I don’t know exactly where my son is at the moment.’ US Grand Jury indictment documents reveal that Rhys-Jones also used the aliases Martin Reece and John Allen while in Barcelona. A spokesman for Bale last night said: ‘I’m aware, but what’s it got to do with us? We are not commenting.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Martin Rhys-Jones, father of Gareth Bale's girlfriend Emma, on remand in US .

Officials did not provide any other details about when or where the phone was found. Murphy was last seen on August 3 by her family. Her car was found in the parking lot of a multiplex in Charlottesville three days later. Randy Allen Taylor, 48, has been held without bond since his August 11 arrest in Murphy's disappearance.

The 48-year-old has also been linked to the disappearance of another teenage girl, it emerged last week. Samantha Clarke, 19, has been missing from her home in neighboring Orange County for three years. Orange County commonwealth's attorney Diane Wheeler said Taylor was the last person known to have had contact with Miss Clarke before she disappeared on September 13, 2010. A graduate of Orange County High School, Miss Clarke had told her brother she was going out for the evening but never returned.

A secret meeting was held between a representative of the Wyoming chapter of the NAACP and a Ku Klux Klan organizer on Saturday night under tight security at a Casper hotel. The meeting was called by Jimmy Simmons, president of the Casper NAACP, after he heard that KKK literature was being distributed in nearby Gillette. Klan organizer John Abarr, who believes in creating an all-white nation independent from the United States, accepted the invitation and maintained his organization is non-violent. Meeting of the minds? Jimmy Simmons (right), of the NAACP meets with John Abarr of Ku Klux Klan group the United Klans of America met Saturday in a Casper, Wyoming hotel surrounded by security . The unlikely meeting even ended with the . KKK's Abarr paying to join the ranks of the civil rights group when he . paid a $30 membership fee. Abarr told The Associated Press on Tuesday he filled out an NAACP membership form so he could get the group's newsletters and some insight into its views. Simmons said he asked for the meeting after receiving reports that KKK literature was being distributed in Gillette, about 130 miles north of Casper, and to discuss race relations, including what he said were reported beatings of African-American men. He did not provide details. Abarr said he knew nothing about hate crimes or the literature, which was distributed in a residential neighborhood of Gillette in October. 'Because we want white babies': John Abarr is an officer of the KKK group United Klans of America, a group that advocates for the secession of Northwestern states to create an all-white nation . 'If you want to talk about hate, get a hater': Jimmy Simmons of the Casper, Wyoming NAACP chapter called the meeting when he learned KKK literature was being distributed in nearby Gillette, Wyoming . Gillette police Lt. Chuck Deaton said there have been 10 hate or bias crimes reported in the past five years that involved name-calling but no assaults on African-Americans. Deaton said police also were unable to speak with a young man distributing the literature, and he was chased away by neighbors. ‘In the 21 years that I've been here, that's the first I heard of the Klan in Gillette,’ Deaton said. Officials with the NAACP in Washington, D.C., requested questions about the meeting in writing but did not immediately respond. United Klans of America imperial wizard Bradley Jenkins of Birmingham, Ala., said in a telephone interview that he sanctioned the meeting and called it a first between the KKK and the NAACP, the nation's oldest civil rights organization. Not a lot in common: Saturday's secretive meeting was the first meeting between the two groups in history according to both sides and the Southern Poverty Law center . The meeting between Jimmy Simmons of the NAACP and Abarr's United Klans of America may not have any historical precedent, but both groups have plenty of history, throughout which they've remained staunch ideological enemies. NAACP . The NAACP was formed as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1909 in part as a response to the KKK-led lynchings that were terrorizing black communities in America at the time, notably through lynchings. The group's goal is to eliminate barriers to equality faced by minority groups in America and eliminate racial prejudice through grass roots activism and education efforts. The group has seen major victories since its founding, having played a role in everything from the dismantling of Jim Crow laws to helping pass hate crime laws. Today, the NAACP is fighting for changes to drug sentencing laws, sturdier voter protections, laws to prevent future deaths like Trayvon Martin's, among other goals. The NAACP claimed a membership of around 500,000 as of 2011. That year, the group's revenue totaled nearly $32,000,000. Old enemies: NAACP president Ben Jealous helps lead a Justice for Trayvon rally. The NAACP was founded in 1909 in response to widespread lynchings, many of which were orchestrated by KKK groups . Dwindling: A much publicized Memphis, Tennessee KKK rally is pictured in March. KKK group numbers have dwindled since the 1970s and 1980s. Police outnumbered Klansmen at the Tennessee rally . UNITED KLANS OF AMERICA . The United Klans of America (UKA) was once the largest of several Ku Klux Klan groups in America. The UKA was one of the most well-known and active groups working in opposition to the civil rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, including the efforts of the NAACP. The group has been called the most murderous of any other group of its day and is blamed for the beating of Freedom Riders in 1961, the murder of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo, and the infamous bombing Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, which killed four young black girls in 1963. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) won a 1987 legal victory over the UKA that effectively saw the group dismantled. Since the 1980s, the Klan has largely remained splintered and unorganized, wracked by internal strife, lawsuits, and government infiltration. The SPLC estimates that various Klan groups, mostly unrelated and warring, count between 5,000 and 8,000 members nationwide. According to the Casper Star-Tribune, John Abarr and his group are pushing for the states of Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington to secede from the United States and form an all-white state. 'Because we want white babies,' Abarr explains. ‘I don't know if we accomplished too much,’ Abarr said. ‘We're not about violence. We're about being proud to be white.’ Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said there have been meetings between white and African-American groups, but none between the NAACP and the KKK. He called the United Klans of America a ‘copycat wannabe’ group that's not the group responsible for violence during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, including the deaths of four girls at a Baptist church in Birmingham. The original UKA was dismantled in the 1980s following a lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center. History: The United Klans of America was once one of the most powerful and violent hate groups working against the civil rights movement but was effectively dismantled by a 1980s lawsuit . ‘I think it's outrageous and counterproductive,’ Potok said of the Wyoming meeting. ‘It gives legitimacy to the Klan as an organization you can talk to.’ Simmons insisted the meeting was worth it. ‘It's about opening dialogue with a group that claims they're trying to reform themselves from violence,’ Simmons said. ‘They're trying to shed that violent skin, but it seems like they're just changing the packaging.’ Abarr said he didn't ask anybody if they would like to join the KKK. ‘You have to be white to join the Klan,’ he said. In 1989, Abarr was a campaign manager for William Daniel Johnson, a white separatist who ran unsuccessfully for Dick Cheney's Wyoming U.S. House seat when Cheney became defense secretary. Johnson proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution calling for citizenship for whites only.","The historic meeting took place at a Casper, Wyoming hotel under tight security .

A lawyer for an Irish nanny charged in the death of a one-year-old Massachusetts girl has accused prosecutors of presenting 'false and deceptive' information to a grand jury. Aisling Brady McCarthy, 34, of Quincy, is charged with murder and assault and battery on a child in the January death of Rehma Sabir, of Cambridge. She was hospitalized on her first birthday with severe head injuries and died two days later. The defense attorney made the allegations against prosecutors today as she asked a judge to dismiss the charges. Aisling Brady McCarthy, left, from Quincy, Mass., is led into the courtroom for a hearing to request charges be dropped, in Middlesex Superior Court in Woburn, Mass., today . Aisling Brady McCarthy, right, from Quincy, Mass., sits with her attorney Melinda Thompson, left, during a hearing to request charges be dropped today . The defense previously claimed prosecutors did not have enough evidence. A prosecutor said the evidence was not misleading or false, and that authorities had to present a complete picture of the girl's injuries. The judge did not immediately rule. Last month, the nanny's lawyers also claimed Boston prosecutors acted unethically in the way they presented evidence to the grand jury that indicted her for the murder. They were seeking the charges to be dismissed based on the alleged prosecutorial misconduct as well as a general lack of probable cause. Plea: Irish nanny Aisling McCarthy Brady, 34, has pleaded not guilty to murdering an infant in her care last January . Her lawyers accuse Middlesex prosecutors of acting unethically in the way they presented evidence to the grand jury but there were no further details on how. Questions have been raised about the length of time between when Brady was arrested, on January 21, and when indictments were obtained, some 80 days later. The defense also contends the case is so weak that it does not meet the low legal threshold of probable cause. Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a statement to The Boston Globe in August, her office is working on a response to the defense allegations, which they will soon file in court. Brady was arraigned April 18 in Middlesex Superior Court, where she pleaded not guilty to all charges and was ordered held without bail. No bail: McCarthy, who has been in the United States illegally for the last 13 years, is being held without bail on charges of first-degree murder and assault . The 34-year-old faces being deported . to Ireland when the criminal case ends because she was living in Boston . illegally, according to federal officials. She . is accused of slamming little Rehma against a wall and changing table . before pretending its lifeless body was sleeping to its relatives. Defense . attorneys have claimed the baby was already 'sick' and 'not normal' while in her care before she was found bruised and unconscious in her . family's Cambridge, Massachusetts home. Rehma Sabir was . hospitalized with severe head injuries on her first birthday, January . 14, before being declared brain dead two days later. In April, prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said Brady violently shook . Rehma, possibly bouncing the infant's skull off a changing table and a . wall, as seen by plaster shattered from the wall. Brady has been in the U.S. illegally for the past 13 years. Parents: The infant's father Sameer Sabir, left, and mother Nada Siddiqui, right, were expecting family in from outside the country to celebrate their child's birthday when their child never woke up . Nanny: The baby's parents, Nada Siddiqui and Sameer Sabir, told police McCarthy had been a nanny for their family for about six months . 'The . wrong person has been charged with this crime,' her attorney Melinda . Thompson said after her arraignment, according to the Boston Herald. 'This baby . was not normal. This baby was sick' Fitzgerald . said that the only 'sickness' Brady's defense was claiming was the . baby experiencing separation anxiety after her mother recently started a . new job. Fitzgerald said the infant's father, . Sameer Sabir, and mother, Nada Siddiqui, were expecting family in from . outside the country to celebrate their child's birthday when their child . never woke up. Claims: McCarthy's defense claims that the infant was already sick and not normal before its death . When the baby's grandparents arrived . at the home to see the child after Siddiqui had left for work, McCarthy . told them Rehma was napping, according to Fitzgerald. She presented them with a video baby monitor showing Rehma appearing to be sleeping as evidence. Later when they returned that evening, around 4.30 p.m., McCarthy said Rehma was still sleeping. The family went to wake the child, but were unsuccessful, prompting a call to 911. According to Fitzgerald, damage was seen to the wall with chips of plaster found on the floor. Blood was also found on the infant's pillow, a dish towel thrown in a trash can, and six baby wipes. The blood was not publicly identified as belonging to Rehma. Earlier in April, a Middlesex County grand jury also accused the nanny of assault and battery on a child causing bodily injury. Brady had previously pleaded not guilty to assault and battery on a child causing substantial bodily injury. Prosecutors . said in the statement: 'The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . conducted an autopsy and ruled that the cause of death is blunt force . head injuries, and the manner of death is homicide and not accidental.' The . prosecutors also claim that investigators reached the conclusion that . the nanny was alone with the baby when her fatal injuries occurred. Partner: Brady, got married in September 2012 to Irish national Don McCarthy, 38 . In February, a judge ruled in Brady's . favor when her lawyer asked for the preservation of all records related . to the baby's travel and people who were around her from June 2012 until . she died. That included who traveled with the baby, where the baby stayed and whether medical personnel examined her. The defense has claimed Rehma . returned home malnourished after traveling overseas, including to . Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and London. Authorities . also said a neighbor reported hearing the baby crying for nearly an . hour on her birthday, followed by more intense crying, but knocks on the . family's door went unanswered.

Authorities have surveillance footage showing former NFL star Aaron Hernandez at a club with two men who were shot dead hours later, law enforcement sources have revealed. Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, were killed in a drive-by shooting on July 15, 2012 after they left the club in south Boston - in a murder that remains unsolved. The former New England Patriots tight end has not been charged in the case, but he has been the main focus after investigators said he was at the same nightclub as the men before the shooting. He is awaiting a trial in Massachusetts for the June murder of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, 27. It was reported in June that Lloyd could . have known about Hernandez's alleged involvement in the 2012 double . murder and Hernandez reportedly killed him to keep him quiet. Connection? Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing a semi-pro footballer in June, was allegedly in the same club as two men hours before they were murdered in a drive-by shooting in Boston in 2012 . 'The motive might have been that the . victim (Lloyd) knew (Hernandez) might have been involved,' unidentified . police officials told The Boston Globe at the time. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to shooting dead Lloyd, whose body was found near the sport star's home in a Boston suburb. Hernandez was released by the New England Patriots when he was implicated in the killing and has been jailed without bail since his arrest in June. The 2012 shooting took place after a fight broke out inside Cure, a South End nightclub. It was reported that Abreu and Furtado got into an argument with a group that included Hernandez. Victims: Safiro Furtado, left, and Daniel Abreu, right, were killed after getting in an altercation in a club last year . Scene: The men were killed as they drove from the club with other friends on July 15, 2012 . Seized: Police took an SUV similar to one seen at the scene from Hernandez's uncle's house . CTNow reported on Tuesday that multiple sources had claimed authorities had footage of the football player and the victims at the same nightclub. As Abreu drove away from the club in his BMW with Furtado in the passenger's seat, a silver or grey SUV with Rhode Island license plates pulled up to the car and started shooting. There were other men in the BMW who all survived the attack but both Furtado and Abreu died. The exact motive behind the killings of the two friends, who worked together for a cleaning company, is not known. The men did not know Hernandez, their relatives have said. The case is now being heard by a grand jury to determine whether there is enough evidence to file charges. Arrest: The gun allegedly used to shoot the two men was found in the trunk of a car driven by Jailene Diaz-Ramos, pictured. She said she was giving a ride to footballer friends who must have left it there . After searching Hernandez's uncle's . home, investigators allegedly found a silver SUV rented in the . footballer's name that roughly matched the description of the one seen . at the scene, the Hartford Courant reported. The vehicle, which had been parked in the garage for about year, was seized by Boston authorities. They made a connection between Hernandez and the double homicide after the former NFL star fell in the spotlight for Lloyd's killing, The Boston Globe reported. In another twist, police found the handgun used in the double murder in the trunk of a 19-year-old woman's car after she crashed near Springfield, Massachusetts in June. The Massachusetts State Police sent the weapon in for ballistics testing and learned that it fired the rounds that killed Abreu and Furtado. Accused: Hernandez is now facing trial for the murder of Odin Lloyd, right, who was found dead in June . The woman, Jailene Diaz-Ramos, who is from Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, reportedly said she was giving her friends - who were football players - a ride to work and that they must have left it in her car. Diaz-Ramos faces three illegal firearms charges. Hernandez, who was indicted by a federal grand jury in August, is set to appear in court in Fall River, Massachusetts on Friday.","Law enforcement sources: Authorities have footage showing NFL star in the same club as the two men hours before they were killed .

It's a minor misdemeanour that lands millions of men across the world in trouble with their wives. But help could finally be here for those who miss the mark and wet the toilet seat while relieving themselves, thanks to a Chinese invention. The Pee Straight contraption is effectively a standard funnel attached to a 10 inch pipe designed to help both men and women with their aim. Take aim: Two Chinese women sell the Pee Straight invention outside a public toilet in the city of Shenzhen . Bemused: This man seems amused by the saleswoman's attempts to convince him to invest in one of the inventions . The device was invented by Shenzhen entrepreneur Ma Xianqing in response to a civic crackdown on those who can't aim properly. As part of the Shenzhen City Public Toilet Management Act, those who make a mess in a public toilet could be hit with a $15 fine by sanitation managers if caught. The law also punishes anyone who is found grafittiing, smoking or littering public loos. As well as helping to keep Shenzhen's toilets sparkling, the inventor also claims that the Pee Straight affords its user a degree of privacy while at the urinal. The device comes in male and female versions, with the women's having a shorter pipe. Handy: The devices have been introduced in the wake of a new law that could see residents of the city fined $15 if they make a mess while relieving themselves . According to NBC News, city officials wouldn't comment on whether on not anyone had been fined under the new law. While many took to social networking sites in China to ridicule both the new law and the subsequent invention, others were clearly impressed. One user urged the inventor to have the device patented as soon as possible on Weibo, China's answer to Twitter. Shenzhen was recently declared the world's most unfriendly city by Conde Nast Traveller magazine.","The Pee Straight device has gone on sale in Shenzhen, southern China .
