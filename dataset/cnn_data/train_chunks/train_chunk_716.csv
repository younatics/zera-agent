Home invasion survivor William Petit has had a wonderful year and for the first time since 2007, he will be able to enjoy Christmas with one of his children. Dr Petit and his wife of one year, Christine, have shared photos of their newborn son William and are clearly enjoying their time as parents once more. The latest photo that Christine, a professional photographer, shared on her Facebook wall of the father holding his weeks-old son looking out at the first snowfall, captioning the picture with lines from a poem about rebirth. Looking out at the future: Dr William Petit is pictured holding his son 'little Bill' up to the window as they look out at the first snow of the season in Connecticut . Dressed for the season: The Petits have a lot to celebrate this Christmas, and it looks like the newborn boy is ready to help raise their Christmas spirits in this holiday outfit . 'Love these two! This poem really touched me... just so appropriate for the situation, and so moving,' Christine wrote of The First Snowfall by James Russell Lowell. Happy and uplifting family photos are something that have not been a familiar sight in the Petit household ever since 2007, when Mr Petit's wife and two teenage daughters were raped and killed in a brutal home invasion. The family was held hostage for hours at their Cheshire, Connecticut home before it was set alight by Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky. Dr Petit was severely beaten and dumped in the basement but managed to escape. His daughters Michaela, 11, Hayley, 17, and wife Jennifer were killed in the home. Happy: The couple (at their wedding last year) met when she offered to take photos for his foundation . Tragic loss: Dr Petit with his wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit and their daughters, Hayley, top center, and Michaela. The three women died in a horrific home invasion in 2007 . After the tragedy, Dr Petit met Christine Paluf at his local country club when she offered to volunteer for the Petit Family Foundation, which was created in the memory of his late wife and daughters. When the killers went on trial in 2011, Christine was there for Petit, sitting behind him in the courthouse along with his relatives and listening through hours of agonizing testimony. Last year they married and moved into a small home in Farmington River in western Connecticut. In August, the couple announced that Christine was pregnant with their first child, and the boy was born just days before Thanksgiving. Adorable: Christine wrote on Facebook 'Pinkies up!! There's a new nerd in the Petit household!' 'Our son is a beautiful Thanksgiving and Christmas gift,' Dr Petit said at the birth of his son, William Petit III. 'He is very lovable and sweet. I will tell him of his two big sisters, Hayley and Michaela, and how they always helped others with smiles on their faces. I am sure they and their mother Jennifer are smiling down upon him.' Christine, whose marriage to Dr Petit was her first, has been happily adding photos of her adorable young son to the Facebook page for her photography studio. In one, he poses with a copy of Le Petit Prince and wears horn-rimmed glasses and she jokes that 'there's a new nerd in the Petit household!' Hello Daddy! Baby William Petit, who is now nine days old, looks up at his father, Dr William Petit, in a new image released by the family. His birth comes six years after Dr Petit's family was killed in a home invasion . Bundle of joy: William Arthur Petit III was born on November 23 to Christine Petit and her husband Dr William Petit . The new year is bound to bring big changes for the growing family- aside from the presence of 'little Bill'- as Christine wrote that she found a new photography studio on the river just days before her son was born. Dr Petit's name has also been speculated as being a possible Republican challenger in a run against the sitting Democratic congressman. He has apparently had meetings with state party leaders but has made no formal statements pertaining to his run yet.

An electrician who was so overweight his company had to buy him a specially reinforced van has been crowned the 'Greatest Loser 2013' after shedding more than half his bodyweight. Dean Worrall, 36, lost 16st 13.5 lbs after he was made redundant and had feared he wouldn't get another job due to his 33st bulk. After making dramatic changes to his diet, he now weighs 16st 4lbs and has whittled down his  waistline from 68 inches to just 40 inches in less than two years - and has finally got his career back on track. Half the man he was: Dean Worrall has lost 16st 13.5 lbs in less than two years . New wardrobe needed: The electrician has whittled down his  waistline from 68 inches to 40 inches . But in 2009, after years of living on fried food and calorie-laden tubs of ice cream, Dean was so overweight he was unable to perform basic tasks at work including climbing ladders and squeezing into small spaces. Dean, who was crowned Slimming World's Greatest Loser after losing more weight than any other member this year, said: 'My weight impacted on every aspect of my work to the point where, if I'm honest, I struggled to do my job properly. 'When I needed a new van there were only a few models I could have because I couldn't fit into the front seats of most of them. 'When I went on a job I had to bring a mate or an apprentice because I couldn't fit in certain spaces, and I couldn't go up into lofts in case I came through the ceiling. But worse was to come. 'When I was made redundant I wondered who would ever want to hire a 33 stone electrician,' he revealed. Career back on track: Dean was worried he wouldn't get another job because of his large size . 'Every time I walked into a room for an interview I had to ask for a bigger chair or one without arms because they didn't fit me. That was almost like a cross in the box against me before I'd even started.' Dean, who is single, said he hit rock bottom in August 2010 after 18 months out of work. It was during an interview during which he had to ask for a wider chair that he finally realised he had to lose weight. 'I knew losing weight would be the best way to increase my chances of finding work again,' he explained. Dean's weight problems began as a child but trouble really started after he left aged 16 and began to enjoy the freedom earning money and being able to drive brought him. He explained: 'The combination of available funds, the freedom that having a car gave me and long hours working and at college meant that I was living on fast food on the move and before I knew it my weight was out of control. 'My biggest vice was takeaway pizza with extra bacon and cheese - I knew I could order it at work and it would be there by the time I got home.' Accolade: Dean has been crowned Slimming World's Greatest Loser 2013 . Before losing weight, he'd tuck into a full English breakfast or sausage and egg McMuffins, followed by a lunch of pie and chips, while dinner consisted of chicken nuggets or pizza with extra bacon and cheese and chips with a tub of Haagen Dazs ice cream for dessert. If he felt peckish between meals, Dean opted for a bar of chocolate or bag of crisps to satisfy his hunger. However, after switching to porridge or yoghurt for breakfast, tuna with couscous and grilled veg for lunch and healthy roasted chicken and veg for dessert Dean noticed the weight melt away. A visit to his GP brought a referral to a slimming group, and Dean, who chose a Slimming World group with a male leader, was surprised and pleased to see several other men in the group, and soon began losing weight. He found work through an agency just a week after joining and has been busy ever since, while the weight-loss has transformed his working day. He said: 'I'm loving life again and would recommend anyone who's thinking about trying to lose weight, whether it's just a stone or two or a lot like me , just to go for it. 'I'd never have believed I'd be here less than three years later and half the man I was with a whole new life to look forward to, but it's true.'","Dean Worrall, 36, used to tip the scales at 33st .

Perhaps it goes without saying that when it comes to wanton narcissism and rampant self-satisfaction, the ranks of the supermodel sisterhood take some beating. But for sheer ineffable smugness, Gisele Bundchen has long been in a league of her own. Now even she has outdone herself. This week, the world's top model posted a photo on her official Twitter feed and Instagram account that shows her reclining, all caramel limbs and honey-hued tresses, as a team of stylists pamper every inch of her billion-dollar body. Multi-tasking, Gisele-style: The supermodel feeds her daughter while having her hair, nails and make-up done . Languidly raising a lithe arm for her manicurist while her hairdresser and make-up artist attend to her other beauty needs, the Brazilian glamour-puss is captured in her suitably stylish high-rise apartment dressed in a luxuriously fluffy white bathrobe. Look a bit closer, however, and her dressing gown is pulled discreetly open. In her other arm she cradles her one-year-old daughter, Vivian, while the child contentedly breastfeeds. 'What would I do without this beauty squad after 15 hours of flying and only 3 hours of sleep?' Miss Bundchen trilled in a caption. And in case anyone is in doubt about how exhausting the life of a catwalk glamazon can be, she also added the hashtag '#multitasking' to her message, just to press home the point. No doubt Gisele hopes her 1.6 million Twitter followers will wonder just how on earth she does it. But, then, being as out-of-touch as she is gorgeous seems to come naturally to the 33-year-old model. Smug: Gisele told Vogue that after the birth of her first child she regained her figure effortlessly and instantly by doing yoga . Take, for example, her pearls of wisdom on breastfeeding, of which she is a highly vocal advocate. (Indeed, this latest picture is yet another salvo in Gisele's personal war against bottle-feeding. After all, she is still breastfeeding her year-old daughter in this picture, a time by which most lesser mothers have abandoned it.) Gisele attracted much controversy a year or so ago when she announced haughtily that it should be illegal for mothers not to feed their children the way nature intended until they were at least six months old. 'There should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies,' she told a fashion magazine. At the same time, she chastised women for getting fat while pregnant: 'I think a lot of people get pregnant and decide they can turn into garbage disposals. I was mindful about what I ate and I gained only  30 pounds (just over 2st).' Not that putting on weight has ever really been an issue for the impossibly svelte Gisele. She told Vogue magazine that after the birth of her first child Benjamin, now four, she regained her figure effortlessly and instantly by doing the odd bit of yoga in her living room. 'I think it's muscle memory,' she said carelessly. 'I did kung fu up until two weeks before Benjamin was born, and yoga three days a week. 'It prepared me mentally and physically. It's called “labour” not “holiday” for a reason, and I knew that.' So much so that she described taking care of her house and husband just 24 hours after giving birth: 'The next day I was walking, I was washing dishes, I was making pancakes in the kitchen.' As well as her 'muscle memory', Gisele boasts that she's always been an athlete. Born one of six girls in the German-speaking hamlet of Horizontina in southern Brazil, she says she spent her childhood outdoors 'like a little monkey, jumping from tree to tree in bare feet'. Naturally, she was captain of her school volleyball team and hasn't stopped working with the body God gave her since then. So devoted is she to her beloved yoga that she recently posed for a picture in which she performed an impossibly bendy stretch, mimicked by her baby daughter. On the subject of exercise generally, Gisele is scathing about those who train hard, preferring to rely on her natural talents. No aerobics  for her. She declared: 'I think it's better when you're natural, when you just do whatever you want, instead of doing classes where I see all these other people holding back because they've been trained with certain skills or techniques. I'm like, whatever.' Gisele has also praised her beloved breastfeeding for its weight loss benefits. 'I think breastfeeding really helped,' she said. 'Some people think they don't have to breastfeed. I think: “Are you going to give chemical food to your child, when they are so little?” ' Nor was she any slouch about getting back into shape following the birth of Vivi, her pet name for daughter Vivian, this time last  year. Within weeks, she was photographed looking sensational on holiday in a bikini. Winding up mothers everywhere: 'I want to have lots of children. It doesn't matter if my body changes' But, as ever, Gisele managed to wind up mothers everywhere with her comments about the effect babies had on her body. 'I want to have lots of children,' she said. 'It doesn't matter if my body changes. It is the most marvellous thing. For example, they sometimes say that your breasts begin to sag, but I couldn't care less.' But Gisele's breasts are as pert as ever, despite her protestations. All of which, one suspects, is enough to make most hard-pressed mothers spit. However, as the latest photo of 'Team Gisele' proves, she has hardly done it without help. And she can certainly afford the coterie of hired staff who travel the world with her attending to her every whim. For the seventh year, she has been named the world's top-earning supermodel by Forbes magazine. She raked in an eye-watering £27 million, despite taking time off to have her second child. And if that were not enough, the family coffers were boosted to the tune of another £24 million by the astronomical salary of Miss Bundchen's husband of four years, American football player Tom Brady. In the earning stakes, the power couple even out-rank Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Meanwhile, Forbes has predicted Gisele is on her way to being the first model to become a dollar billionaire. As well as contracts for fashion chain H&M, Pantene, Oral-B and Sky TV, she is the face of Chanel's Les Beiges make-up and has her own line of lacy underwear, called Gisele Intimates, and range of sandals. It has bought her and the lantern-jawed Brady, the star quarterback for New England Patriots, an enviable lifestyle. She recently proudly opened up their £12 million, French chateau-style Los Angeles mansion, which has its own moat, to an American magazine. The holier-than thou model claims the eco-friendly house, which has a gym bigger than an average semi, was built using 90 per cent recycled or antique fittings, and insists the couple grow 85 per cent of their own fruits and vegetables. And, as we speak, a team of 100 workmen is busily constructing another stunning des res for the couple in upmarket Massachusetts. They also have a home in Brazil and a beachside estate in Costa Rica, where the couple held their lavish wedding celebrations in April 2009. On that occasion, however, they were not so keen on letting prying eyes in. Paparazzi photographers were confronted by guards, and two of the heavies have been jailed for attempted murder after firing at the snappers, none of whom was hit. The ever-outspoken Gisele has not always endeared herself to husband's team-mates. Last year, she got into hot water after blaming his fellow players when she was caught on video arguing with rival fans about Brady's performance in a game. Outspoken: Gisele, pictured with her husband and star quarterback Tom Brady (left) and at her day job (right), has argued with rival fans about Brady's performance in a game . 'He didn't catch the ball when he was supposed to catch the ball,' she said of one. 'My husband cannot f****** throw the ball and catch  the ball at the same time. I can't believe they dropped the ball so many times.' Which is, of course, something Miss Bundchen would never do. Meanwhile, women have reacted vociferously on the Mail's website to Gisele's latest pictures. One said: 'Honey, you are NOT multitasking. It's your army of stylists, nannies, cleaning ladies, chefs, drivers . .  Ask a mother who has to work a regular job AND be a mother and housewife at the same time.' Another, called Elaine said: 'Celebrities like Gisele, Gwyneth and others like them really have no awareness whatsoever about how the rest of the world perceives their bragging about a life of wealth and privilege, do they? Quick way to look the utter fool really.' But perhaps the sharpest comment came from Elly, in Cardiff: 'The word “smug” springs to mind.'","An incredibly successful model, Gisele may be allowed some narcissism .

Clever disguise: One of the baboons covered itself in the pink curtains as the group fled the scene with their takings . Cyril Ruoso, from Lailly in Burgundy, France, travelled to Cape Town, South Africa, to take photographs of the famous baboons in the area. The 43-year-old wildlife photographer and journalist said: ‘At the beginning, only one of the baboons was inside the flat. ‘He opened the wide front windows to the flat with his mouth, and around ten baboons then came into the flat. ‘They were in there for more than half an hour as nobody was able to do anything. The owners were out and nobody had any keys to enter. ‘I am quite used to working with monkeys, but I was amazed. And then when they came out with a blanket, curtains and a giant teddy bear, I was even more astonished. ‘The baboons played with the teddy bear like a kid plays with a doll. They even groomed it like a monkey!’ Havoc: The owners returned to a completely trashed kitchen after the baboons had their way . Mr Ruoso added: ‘It is easy to understand the baboons are looking for food, but they are intelligent and very social animals. ‘Interactions and social behaviours are a big part of their education to become an adult baboon. ‘Play seems to be a very good way for the youngsters to learn how to behave as baboon. ‘They love to be hidden behind leaves and tree trunks in the wild - I have seen that several times. ‘Here, they do the same with new materials, like a blanket or curtains. ‘But the teddy bear used as a doll is much more of a mystery to me, especially because the adult baboons used it too.’ The monkey raids are common in South Africa, where monitoring teams are employed to try to keep the baboons at bay.","A group of baboons trashed a flat in Cape Town, South Africa .

A new ‘secret justice’ row flared up last night after it was revealed that two suspected terrorists could be tried behind closed doors. Prosecutors will apply to a judge today for a draconian order to hold large parts of a major terrorist trial out of the public eye.

The second man, known . as CD, has been charged with possessing a terrorist document and an . offence under the Identity Documents Act 2010. The . document is suspected of being instructions on how to make a bomb and . prosecutors claim it was found hidden on a memory card in their mobile . phones. During a hearing . last month, prosecutor Michael Atkinson said the defendants could not be . identified to ‘protect an ongoing investigation’. He said that . associates of one of the defendants may also recognise him if further . details of the charges he faces are revealed.

Hillary Clinton wants to take out his grudge by shooting her in the vagina. Pete Santilli isn’t extremely well known, nor are his ideas . mainstream, but he’s managed to get some rather big names on his radio show of . late. Recent guests on the internet-based show including NRA board member Ted . Nugent and Gun Owners of America director Larry Pratt and have lent some . heightened visibility to Santilli’s homespun show. Now the conspiracy theorist has really doubled down on increasing his name recognition, though it may not be in the wisest way. Low blow: Conspiracy theorist and host of a right wing internet broadcast Pete Santilli said last week he wants to 'shoot Hillary Clinton in the vagina.' While discussing the Benghazi scandal, an enraged Santilli said . he wanted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to pay for ‘all the . Americans [she’s] killed.’ ‘I want to shoot her right in the vagina,’ Santilli said . last week. ‘On behalf of all of those people, I’m supporting our troops by . saying we need to try, convict, and shoot Hillary Clinton in the vagina.’ The shocking comment apparently stems from the host’s belief . that the Obama administration faked the Osama bin Laden capture. ‘On behalf of all Americans that you’ve killed,’ he said, ‘on . behalf of the Navy SEALS, the families of Navy SEAL Team Six who were involved . in the fake hunt down of this Obama, Obama bin Laden thing, that whole fake . scenario, because these Navy SEALS know the truth, they killed them all.’ Shock jock: Santilli believes Clinton, along with Obama, allowed Americans to die and deserve to be shot for treason--in the genitals in Clinton's case . But Santilli didn’t reserve his wraith for Clinton. He also . had words for the president himself and warned listeners that those who . disagreed shall be deemed un-American. ‘Barack Obama needs to be tried, convicted, and shot for . crimes against the United States of America,’ he said. ‘And if anybody has a . problem with that, then you are an enemy of our state.’ The host’s rants aren’t reserved for Democrats, though. On . the same show, he called for the Bush family to be shot for treason. Though his recent words are decidedly uncouth, they are a . far cry from the most unbelievable comments he’s made. Bold: Santilli's show is available only online, but he says he is willing to go national if the FCC 'can handle my truth & honesty' Santilli posted an article on his website in December that . mapped out his belief the Sandy Hook massacre was a Satanic human sacrifice . that was based on rituals seen in the most recent Batman film and further . proven by the elementary school’s central location between Stonehenge and the . Aztec Pyramid of the Sun. Santilli also espouses beliefs that high tech energy beams . are what took down the Twin Towers on 9/11 and that George H.W. Bush and ‘his . cronies’ orchestrated the JFK assassination, among other theories. On his site, Santilli says he's prepared to take his truther message and unusual ideas to a national audience, if the audience is ready for him. 'I am a radio talkshow host ready to take my show to national syndication,' he writes. 'That is, of course, if the FCC regulated AM/FM radio stations can handle my truth & honesty.'",Self-proclaimed 'truther' Pete Santilli also said he believes President Obama should be shot over Benghazi scandal .

Perhaps online you're in a 'complicated' relationship, but in reality you're all on your tod. Maybe you're spending Saturday night at home alone with a box of Maltesers when all your eFriends think you're 'in the pub with the girls'. Or are you posting photos of a beach in Barbados, when really you're repainting the shed in Croydon? A third of women admit being dishonest at least once a month on social networking sites, according to research. But a new 'anti-social' networking forum, Pencourage.com, is hoping to bring an end to this world of made-up make-believe, enabling users to post anonymously and be as honest as they would in a personal diary. Pencourage.com allows users to post completely anonymously and without the fear of online friends judging them . Pencourage - subtitled online with 'imagine if you could read other people's thoughts?' - was launched to bridge the gap between what people say (on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and what they really think. Describing the site as 'as real as it gets', founders say the idea is that people journal 'every aspect of their lives, as it really is'. Users predominantly take to the site to have a much-needed moan about life, relationships, work, personal struggles and financial stresses, and other writers then impart words of advice and encouragement. Website users take to Pencourage to have a much-needed moan about work, relationships, financial woes and personal struggles, and receive words of encouragement and advice from other site members . Since the new online platform went live two months ago, . over 3,000 people have signed up and nearly 4,000 entries have been . posted. Primarily written by women (core demographic has been tracked as . female, ages 32-45), the site's anonymous disclosures provide a raw, . unfiltered snapshot of thoughts that would never see the light of day on . personal blogs, Facebook or even Twitter. This is also giving the . ongoing diaries an addictive, voyeuristic quality - site viewers spend an average . 12 minutes every time they visit, checking in regularly to see what's . been happening with the people they 'follow'. Pencourage enables people to write as if penning a personal diary, and be as miserable and honest as they like . Recent heartfelt posts include messages about depression, breaking up with a partner, losing jobs, bullying and guilt. According to one leading psychologist the pressure to stay connected on social media can paradoxically leave us more isolated. Pencourage enables people to be truly honest about the way they are feeling. Dr Michael Sinclair, . Consultant Counselling Psychology and Clinical Director at City Psychology . Group said: 'The popularity of this new social media site is not surprising at all. We work very hard presenting ourselves to the world online, pretending . and attempting to be happy all the time which is exhausting and . ultimately unfulfilling. 'Omitting the less desirable imperfections of . our lives from the conversations with our ""friends"" online leads to less . opportunity to feel empathised with - resulting in a greater sense of . disconnection from others.' Pencourage allows people to be completely honest with the world and themselves . A recent survey by OnePoll into lying online revealed that 33 per cent of women are dishonest on social networking sites at least once a month. The most common things respondents lied or exaggerated about were what they are doing at the moment, how much they drink, where they are on holiday, how successful they are and their relationship status. The top reasons given for lying were worrying that others see you as boring, feeling jealous of others' exciting posts, having nothing else to say and wanting to impress someone.","Pencourage.com lets people to be as honest as they would be in a diary .

The Bank of England will expand an £80billion scheme to increase the flow of cheap loans to households and businesses - and buy-to-let landlords are set to benefit. Funding for Lending was launched in August to offer cheaper credit to cash-strapped small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggling to get funding in the wake of the financial crash. Under Funding for Lending, every pound of additional net lending to SMEs for the rest of this year will entitle banks to £10 of super-cheap Bank of England loans. Pay it forward: The Bank of England will allow business that borrow money under the Funding for Lending Scheme to pass it on to property investors. The scheme has been criticised as a desperate attempt to prop up the economy by Chancellor George Osbourne . Now these SMEs will be allowed to lend the money on to property investors. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank, told the Financial Times that although the BoE's extension of the scheme was intended to boost lending to SMEs, it would also bolster the struggling housing market. (These are the only lenders to receive FLS so far) 'It could be a no-brainer,' he said. 'Lend to a landlord ... and get 10 times that lending back as essentially free funding, then recycle some of that back out again on mortgages or BTL (buy-to-let).' However, the scheme has been criticised for pumping money primarily into cheaper mortgages for those who already have large equity stakes, rather than into better rates for business loans or for first-time buyers that are struggling to meet tougher lending criteria from banks. On Tuesday Chancellor George Osbourne . was forced to deny he was panicking over the economy as the threat of a . triple-dip recession loomed after rumours about the scheme's expansion . emerged. However, it was today revealed that the UK economy has avoided a triple-dip recession, growing by 0.3 per cent between January and March this year. The economy was left on the brink of a triple dip recession, after output shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2012. The better-than-expected figure means that the economy returned to growth this year, following a contraction in the final quarter of 2012, meaning the UK narrowly avoided its third recession since 2008. Chancellor George Osborne said: ‘Today's figures are an encouraging sign the economy is healing. Despite a tough economic backdrop, we are making progress.’ He added: ‘We all know there are no easy answers to problems built up over many years, and I can't promise the road ahead will always be smooth, but by continuing to confront our problems head on Britain is recovering and we are building an economy fit for the future.’ Hair's breadth: Today's figures reveal the UK has avoided a third recession since 2008 .","Businesses will be allowed to pass cheap loans on to landlords .

One involves substituting food for alcohol, another sees slimmers try to survive off air alone. These are just two of the fashionable celebrities diets which have made this year's list of the most dangerous fad diets. As the season of overindulgence approaches, the British Dietetic Association has released a list of the celebrity diets that are best avoided. Scroll down for video . Top of the list of diets to avoid is the Breatharian Diet, which Michelle Pfeiffer is said to have followed . Top of the list is the Breatharian Diet, which involves substituting food and drinks for air, followed by the Biotyping Diet, which sees slimmers attempt to cut their fat levels by changing their body’s hormone balance. In third place is the Gluten Free Diet, in fourth the Alcorexia Diet, which involves substituting food for alcohol, and in fifth the Dukan Diet, a high protein and low carb diet which is said to promote rapid weight loss. The Breatharian Diet - People who follow this diet claim they do not need to eat or drink as they are sustained by air and sunlight alone. The Biotyping Diet - The diet involves carefully selecting foods in an attempt to change the body's hormone balance. The Gluten Free Diet - This involves cutting gluten out of the diet meaning followers don't eat wheat, barley or oats. The Alcorexia Diet - People who follow this diet eat very little so they have 'spare' calories which they can consume in the form of alcohol. The Dukan Diet - This is a high protein, low carbohydrate diet which is said to promote rapid weight loss. The Breatharian Diet was reportedly followed by actress Michelle Pfeiffer and is similar to Madonna’s Air Diet. People who follow this diet claim they do not need to eat or drink because they are sustained by air and sunlight alone. The British Dietetic Association says people should not attempt this diet under any circumstances as there is no evidence to suggest people can survive off oxygen and sunlight. The Biotyping Diet relates to six different hormone types and fat accumulation in different parts of the body and involves trying to reduce body fat through controlling hormone balance. People who follow this diet only eat certain foods in an attempt to manage their hormones to reduce fat in certain areas. The British Dietetic Association says the diet relies heavily on supplements and ‘pseudo-science’. It says people will lose weight on this . diet as it restricts the intake of some foods but says it is not a . healthy way to lose weight. The Gluten Free Diet is said to be followed by Gwyneth Paltrow. It involves cutting out gluten - the protein found in wheat, barley and oats. The British Dietetic Association says . it is important for people with coeliac disease to follow this diet and . that it will lead to weight loss in other people - but that this is . because they consume fewer calories. It . says there is no credible evidence to suggest that eating less gluten . leads to weight loss – the diet causes people to lose weight because . they cut out the cakes and biscuits that contain gluten. Third in the list of diets to avoid is the Gluten Free Diet which is thought to be a favourite of Gwyneth Paltrow. It involves cutting out all foods that contain gluten but is not recommended for anyone other than those with coeliac disease . The Alcorexia, or Drunkorexia, Diet is thought to be a favourite of many top models. It involves eating very few calories and ‘banking’ them in order to binge drink at the weekends. For example, a person might eat very few calories during the week so as to ‘bank’ about 1,500 calories a day. This would mean they had 10,500 ‘saved’ calories which can be made up of drink at the weekends. The British Dietetic Association says . following a very low calorie diet alone is ‘madness’ as it will mean . your body does not get the vitamins and minerals it needs to function. Carole Middleton is said to have followed the high protein, low carb Dukan Diet which came fifth in the list of diets to avoid . It also says this is a very worrying diet which could lead to ‘immense damage’ to the body. The Dukan Diet came top of the list of worst celebrity dies in 2010, 2011 and 2012. It is said to be followed by Carole Middleton and Jennifer Lopez. It is a complicated high protein, low carbohydrate diet that promotes rapid weight loss. The British Dietetic Association says the diet can lead to lack of energy, constipation and bad breath. Sian Porter, consultant dietician and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, said: ‘We hear it all when it comes to the latest way to shed those pounds from the good to the bad, to the down-right dangerous. ‘When people need medical advice, they go to their GP and when people have a toothache, they go to their dentist, but some people will believe almost anything and anyone when it comes to nutrition, food and diet. ‘The bottom line is, if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. ‘Also, if you have to pay out for a DVD or special book or product that will unlock the secrets of losing weight, this can also be a good indicator that the only pounds you will be losing will be out of your wallet. ‘The simple fact is there is no “wonder diet” just as there are no “super foods”.  What is super is the way many marketing machines coin certain phrases to make you think there is some magic wand approach to losing weight. ‘Maybe it’s not as exciting but the truth is, if you do want to lose some weight do it by eating a healthy balanced diet, watch your portion sizes and be physically active.’","Top of the list is the Breatharian Diet which involves swapping food for air .

Modern human technology began more than 70,000 years ago in South Africa before spreading to communities elsewhere, a new study claims. It was there that our ancestors made the first bone tools, the first abstract art, the first jewellery and probably the first stone tipped spears and arrows, research shows. The claims, based on archaeological findings over the past decade, contradict the widely held belief that modern human behaviour originated in Europe about 40,000 years ago. The first nerds? A reconstruction of a Homo sapiens hunting party from the BBC documentary Planet of the Apeman. New research traces the birth of technology 70,000 years to southern Africa . They chime with findings published just last month which suggested that the development of long-range weapons in Africa was the technological breakthrough which allowed humans to become the dominant species. Renowned archaeologist Professor Christopher Henshilwood, of Wits University in South Africa, author of the new paper, says the most recent research decisively shows that Africa is the birthplace of modern human cognition. 'All of these innovations, plus many others we are just discovering, clearly show that Homo sapiens in southern Africa at that time were cognitively modern and behaving in many ways like ourselves,' he said. 'It is a good reason to be proud of our earliest, common ancestors who lived and evolved in South Africa and who later spread out into the rest of the world after about 60,000 years.' The first gadgets: A) bone point from the . Middle Stone Age levels at Peers Cave. B-g) bone tools from the Still Bay levels at Blombos Cave; b-e are bone awls; . f-g are bone points. H-i) engraved lines on tools c and g. J) engraved bone . fragment . Professor Henshilwood's paper is the first detailed summary of research into the Still Bay techno-traditions, dating back 75,000 years, and the Howiesons Poort techno-tradition, which dates back 65,000 years. The paper, entitled Late Pleistocene Techno-traditions in Southern Africa: A Review of the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort, c. 75 ka, published online today in the Journal of World Prehistory. These were periods of many innovations including, for example, the first abstract art (engraved ochre and engraved ostrich eggshell); the first jewellery (shell beads); the first bone tools; and the earliest use of the pressure flaking technique, that was used in combination with heating to make stone spear points and the first probable use of stone tipped arrows. Engraved ochres from the Still Bay M1 phase at . Blombos Cave: A) Two groups of incisions, one on the centre and one . close to the edge; in the centre two joining lines form a 'Y' that is . crossed by a few perpendicular parallel lines; three incisions cross . these lines. B) Two lines that cross perpendicularly on the top right . margin; converging lines produced with a single lithic point. C) this . piece retains only a small area of the original engraved pattern; three . straight oblique lines incised on the top left with two sinuous lines . that cross them. D) three distinct sets of lines engraved on a natural . surface; piece was then knapped and a part of the engraving removed. E) a . group of sinuous lines engraved on one face; the opposite face is . highly scraped and engraved with a cross-hatched pattern. F) Cross-hatched pattern incised on one long edge . The research also addresses some of . the nagging questions as to what drove our ancestors to develop these . innovative technologies. The development of 'high tech' long range weapons 71,000 years ago in Africa gave humans the killing edge which helped make us the dominant species, research suggests. Finds in South Africa suggest that by the time our ancestors began to spread across the planet they had developed advanced weapons that made them more than a match for Neanderthal rivals. Research on stone tools and Neanderthal anatomy strongly suggests that our now-extinct sister species lacked true projectile weapons. 'When Africans left Africa and entered Neanderthal territory they had projectiles with greater killing reach, and these early moderns probably also had higher levels of pro-social (hyper-cooperative) behaviour,' said Curtis Marean, project director and Arizona State University professor in the Institute of Human Origins. 'These two traits were a knockout punch. Combine them, as modern humans did and still do, and no prey or competitor is safe. 'This probably laid the foundation for the expansion out of Africa of modern humans and the extinction of many prey as well as our sister species such as Neanderthals.' According to Professor Henshilwood . answers to these questions are, in part, found in demography and climate . change, particularly changing sea levels, which were major drivers of . innovation and variability in material culture. This paper is just the latest to come from Professor Henshilwood and others' research on African archaeology that has debunked the idea that modern human behaviour originated in Europe after about 40,000 years ago. There is increasing evidence for an African origin for behavioural and technological modernity more than 70,000 years ago and that the earliest origin of all Homo sapiens lies in Africa with a special focus in southern Africa. Last month MailOnline reported a new study by U.S. researchers which suggested the development of 'high tech' long range weapons 71,000 years ago in the region gave humans the killing edge to help make us the dominant species. The findings at Pinnacle Point, near Mossel Bay, included Stone Age technology that only took hold in other areas of Africa and in Eurasia about 50,000 years later. Those researchers noted that the depth of archaeological research in Africa was minuscule compared to that which has taken place so far in Europe, and because of that it was likely that far more would be learned soon. In the new paper, Professor Henshilwood writes: 'In just the past decade our knowledge of Homo sapiens behaviour in the Middle Stone Age, and in particular of the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort, has expanded considerably. 'With the benefit of hindsight we may ironically conclude that the origins of ""Neanthropic Man"", the epitome of behavioural modernity in Europe, lay after all in Africa.'","Technology found in southern Africa predates similar artefacts found in Europe by 30,000 years .

Crackdown: Prime Minister David Cameron has outlined changes to to foreign workers' benefits rights . Brussels was facing open revolt over its no-borders immigration policy last night. Hours after David Cameron outlined a crackdown on benefit tourism, France and Germany sensationally followed suit with similar plans. The triple assault pushed Brussels onto the back foot and one of its commissioners was told to quit for claiming Britain risked becoming the ‘nasty country’ of Europe. In Westminster, 46 Tory MPs kept up the pressure by signing a Commons motion calling for restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian workers to stay in place after January 1 because Britain was ‘full up’. An agreement signed by Angela Merkel’s new coalition government in Berlin said ‘poverty migration’ from new EU countries was causing considerable social problems. It declared: ‘We will therefore tackle unjustified benefit claims by EU citizens.’ Francois Hollande’s socialist government said the ‘social dumping’ of people from poor Eastern European states amounted to ‘a threat to the economic and social fabric of France’. His ministers outlined plans to limit the rights of temporary workers from other countries. Mr Cameron insisted he was sending a clear message that Britain was no soft touch but he was criticised for again refusing to predict how many Romanians and Bulgarians will come to Britain when temporary controls are lifted on January 1. There was also anger that some of the Prime Minister’s changes to benefit rights will not be in place in time. Triple assault: Both the French President Francois Hollande, pictured left, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, pictured right, are looking at similar proposals to restrict 'poverty migration' Home Secretary Theresa May told the Commons about the series of steps to limit the right of EU migrants to claim UK benefits, which include: . But some of the MPs who called for an extension of controls on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants urged Mr Cameron to do more – and risk EU fines. Former minister Sir Gerald Howarth said the proposals were ‘incredibly robust’ but said even at this late stage ministers should ‘contemplate extending the transitional arrangements so that we have another two or three years to prepare’. Eviction: The development comes just a day after the mass eviction of Roma families from their illegal camp near the . Var river in Nice, southeastern France, by French police . In angry exchanges in the Commons, Tory MP Charles Walker urged the Home Secretary to ‘find her inner lion or tiger and extend transitional controls until 2019’, adding: ‘She should take the hit and not pay the EU fine.’ Philip Hollobone, another Conservative, said: ‘My constituents take the view that this country is full, and that we should not open our borders to Romania and Bulgaria.’ Jacob Rees-Mogg, MP for North East Somerset, said: ‘The free movement of people is no longer working in the interests of this nation, so why do Her Majesty’s Government lack the political will to change the law?’ European Commission president José Manuel Barroso said Mr Cameron had called him earlier this week ‘informing me about the intentions he has on these issues of freedom of movement’. ‘I had the occasion to underline to Prime Minister Cameron that free movement is a fundamental treaty principle that must be upheld,’ he added. ‘At the same time I took good note that the UK wants to ensure that the measures it plans to take respect EU law. The Commission can only comment in detail when we receive legislative proposals brought forward by the UK. Threat: The French government claims the 'social dumping' of people from poor Eastern European states is a threat to the 'social fabric of France' ‘The principle of free movement is one of the most valued principles by the EU citizens. There is clear evidence of its economic benefits but we are also aware of the challenges that this can also bring, particularly for local communities and services and EU rules already include measures to prevent abuse.’ Mrs May told MPs the measures would lead to conflict with Brussels, which is already taking Britain to court over an existing ‘right to reside’ test applied to determine migrants’ right to welfare. Mr Cameron questioned the principle of free movement of people across the EU, saying this right could not be ‘unqualified’. ‘Yes, of course, there is a right to take up a specific position if you want to work but there should not be a freedom of movement to claim,’ the Prime Minister added. Controls were ‘not just aimed at Romanians and Bulgarians’ but would apply to ‘anyone in other EU countries thinking of coming to Britain because it is easier to claim benefits’. ‘I think it is very important to send out a clear message that this is not the case,’ he added. New rules: French government ministers have outlined plans to limit the rights of temporary workers from other countries . Mr Cameron suggested a future Tory government, as part of its pledge to renegotiate EU membership, would propose changes to allow member states to halt arrivals if numbers exceeded a fixed level. He also suggested freedom of movement should only be fully allowed if the average income of a country’s people was not too far below the EU average. The Liberal Democrats have supported the clampdown on migrants’ benefit rights, but say they would not back the longer-term reform of freedom of movement rules. London Mayor Boris Johnson suggested fundamental reform was needed. ‘At the moment we are claiming to have capped immigration by having a 60 per cent reduction in New Zealanders, when we can do nothing to stop the entire population of Transylvania – charming though most of them may be – from trying to pitch camp at Marble Arch,’ he said. ‘David Cameron is right about giving countries more flexibility over the time-lag before other nationals may claim benefits, and I can’t believe he is alone among EU leaders.’ Bulgarians pictured in 2006 queuing outside the British Embassy in Sofia to apply for visas to work in the United Kingdom.

Shot dead: 18-year-old Dane Scott Jr. was shot a few weeks after the death of Trayvon Martin, the black teen who was unarmed when he was shot in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer . An Oklahoma jury Tuesday convicted a veteran police captain of first-degree manslaughter in the death of an unarmed teenager who was running away after scuffling with the officer. Del City Police Capt. Randy Trent Harrison shot Dane Scott Jr. in the back on March 14, 2012, following a high-speed chase that began when Harrison tried to pull over Scott's car. Harrison had previously arrested Scott on drug violations, and prosecutors said his pursuit of the teenager crossed the line from professional to personal. The defense portrayed Scott as a drug dealer and said Harrison believed the teen was reaching for a second weapon after the officer took one gun from him during a scuffle that followed the police chase. The jury announced the verdict and recommended the minimum four-year prison sentence after deliberating for about 11 hours over two days. Harrison showed no emotion when the verdict was read. He was handcuffed by sheriff's deputies and led to the Oklahoma County jail. Scott's family wept and hugged one another after the verdict was read. The family said nothing to reporters outside the courtroom. Convicted: Del City police Capt. Randy Harrison has been found guilty of first-degree manslaughter . The shooting occurred just a few weeks . after the death of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager killed by . a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida, and the defense suggested . early on that prosecutors were influenced to file charges to prevent the . type of racial discord that followed that shooting and another . high-profile case in Tulsa last year. Harrison is white; Scott was . black. Prosecutors . haven't said Harrison was motivated by any racial bias, just that . Harrison was wrong to shoot Scott. The jury included three . African-Americans. Oklahoma . County District Attorney David Prater became emotional after the . verdict was announced as he talked to reporters. 'There are no winners . here,' he said. 'We will police our own,' Prater said. 'This is a tough case. It had to be done.' Scene of the scuffle: A police affidavit says Harrison was trying to arrest Scott after a car chase and took a handgun from the teen. As Scott ran away, Harrison fired four times, with the fourth shot striking Scott in the back . John Lockett, 17 (left) the friend of Dane Scott Jr. (right) who was fatally shot by an Oklahoma police captain testified Tuesday that the unarmed 18-year-old was running away when the officer began firing at him . Defense attorney Doug Friesen said he will ask the judge to allow Harrison to remain free while his conviction is appealed. 'I am sorry for Randy, for the way this came out,' Friesen said. 'I wish I could have done a better job.' During the trial, Scott's baggy pants became a central issue. Witnesses say the 18-year-old was trying to hold them up as he ran from Harrison. Although the witnesses testified that they saw no threat from Scott, Harrison and his defense team said the officer believed he was reaching for his pants pocket, where he could have had another gun. Police did not find a weapon on Scott after the shooting. Prater told jurors during closing arguments Monday that Harrison put other people in danger when he fired four shots at Scott, placing bystanders and a fellow officer in harm's way before hitting the teenager in the back with the fourth shot. Prater said Scott was 'no threat at all' at the time. 'He's running and holding his pants,' the prosecutor added. Harrison, a 23-year veteran officer in the Oklahoma City suburb, testified earlier Monday that he feared for his life. 'He had just tried to kill me. He would kill anybody to escape,' Harrison testified. Harrison said he did not want to kill Scott. 'I just didn't have any other choice,' he said. Friesen told jurors that while prosecutors had tried to portray Harrison as 'an out-of-control maniac,' he was actually trying to protect his life and the lives of others. A police affidavit says Scott was unarmed and posed no threat of death or great bodily harm. Harrison faces a minimum of four years and a maximum of life in prison if convicted of manslaughter . Another police officer was running about 10 to 15 feet behind Scott and had just shot him with a Taser when Harrison fired the fatal shot, according to an affidavit. The officer who used the Taser said he didn't see the teen with another weapon. Another witness said it appeared Scott was raising his hands, as if to surrender, when he was shot. According to police, Scott had previous convictions in juvenile court on misdemeanor drug charges and a pending felony case of drug possession with intent to distribute. Harrison had arrested Scott as he allegedly sold drugs near Del City High School in 2011. Court papers indicate Harrison also saw Scott allegedly selling marijuana from his home. Scott allegedly was selling drugs to a passenger in his car before the pursuit that led to the shooting. The charges against Harrison were filed just after two white men were accused of fatally shooting three black people in Tulsa in what prosecutors said were racially motivated attacks.","Del City police Capt.

Opinion: Adrian Smith had posted a link to an article about plans for civil partnership ceremonies in churches with his own comment: 'An equality too far' A Christian housing manager had his salary slashed after allegedly being ‘entrapped’ by a lesbian colleague into criticising gay marriage on his private Facebook page, a court heard yesterday. Adrian Smith, 55, had posted a link to an article about plans for civil partnership ceremonies in churches with his own comment: ‘An equality too far.’ After a lesbian colleague asked if that meant he didn’t approve, he posted that he could not understand ‘why people who have no faith and don’t believe in Christ would want to get hitched in church’. Another colleague complained that the comment was offensive, despite having not seen the post, and Mr Smith was disciplined and had his post downgraded and his salary cut by £14,000. Yesterday the married father-of-one launched a court battle to overturn the decision and win back lost earnings. They stand at nearly £4,000 for the past 18 months, according to his legal team. However, his future lost earnings which he could seek to recoup should he fail to overturn his demotion are likely to be at least £60,000. It is the latest in a series of claims by Christians that they have been discriminated against for expressing their beliefs at work. Mr Smith, of Tottington, near Bury, who attends an evangelical church in Bolton and preaches part-time, posted a link on his Facebook page to an article about gay ‘marriage’ on the BBC website in February last year. Under the headline ‘Gay church marriages get go-ahead’, Mr Smith had posted: ‘An equality too far.’ The hearing was told that of Mr . Smith’s 200 Facebook friends, more than 40 worked with him at the . Trafford Housing Trust. On his profile he gave his occupation as . housing manager at the trust, which runs Trafford council’s housing . stock. Later that day, a lesbian colleague with whom he was friends on . Facebook, Julia Stavordale, 56, responded: ‘Does that mean you don’t . approve?’ Hearing: Mr Smith gave evidence today at Manchester County Court at the start of a two-day trial where he is claiming his employers acted unlawfully in demoting him . A day later, Mr Smith responded: ‘No, . not really. I don’t understand why people who have no faith and don’t . believe in Christ would want to get hitched in church. The Bible is . quite specific that marriage is for men and women. ‘If the State wants to offer civil . marriages to the same sex then that is up to the State; but the State . shouldn’t impose its rules on places of faith and conscience.’ Later that week another colleague, . Stephen Lynch, who was not friends with Mr Smith on Facebook, complained . about the post, despite not having seen it. The trust’s ‘equality and diversity . lead’, Helen Malone, referred it to ‘service leads, neighbourhoods’ Debbie Gorman. Mr Smith was suspended on full pay from his . £35,000-a-year post while an investigation began. Miss Stavordale backed . the complaint, saying the trust should ‘throw the book at him’ and he . was ‘blatantly homophobic’. The following month, Mr Smith was . found guilty of gross misconduct by ‘assistant director, customers’ Mike . Corfield for a breach of trust disciplinary policies. Because he gave . his job as a housing manager on his Facebook profile, his comments could . be construed as representing trust policy. He was told he faced dismissal, but . because of his eight years’ ‘loyal service’ he was instead demoted to . money support adviser on just £21,396-a-year. Unimpressed: Julia Stavordale (pictured right, with her partner Judy Simmons) was a lesbian colleague with whom Mr Smith was friends on Facebook. That reduction was to be phased in . over 12 months but, although Mr Smith’s appeal was rejected, that period . was doubled to 24 months. Adrian . Smith’s bosses said the fact that he gave his job and his employer on . his Facebook profile meant others might see his comments as trust . policy. However, he also revealed his liking for Tottenham Hotspur and for wholemeal toast and apricot jam on the site. Manager . Deborah Gorman was asked whether Mr Smith’s post ‘Well done Spurs’ could have been liable for disciplinary proceedings because it might . offend Manchester United fans. Judge, . Mr Justice Michael Briggs, also asked if Mr Smith’s references to toast . and jam might also be taken to represent trust policy. Yesterday Mr Smith came to court with . his claim for breach of contract and loss of earnings up to his planned . retirement date of 2017 – likely to be as much as £60,000. Mrs Gorman, Mr Corfield and Mr Barrow – . each of whom swore oaths on the Bible – all stood by the decision to . demote him at the hearing before the High Court sitting at Manchester .

He argued that Mr Smith’s comments were clearly his personal views . and he told Mrs Gorman: ‘The whole thing is a huge and extraordinary . over-reaction.’ Last night Miss Stavordale, 56, who no . longer works for the trust and was not called to give evidence, told . the Daily Mail that she had not tried to entrap Mrs Smith.

Charles Rowan, a cage fighter from Michigan, faked his own death to avoid an $80,000 debt from his drug dealer. He's not only still alive, he was sentenced to 17 1/2 to 40 years in prison yesterday after he pleaded guilty to robbing a Michigan gun store. Rowan, 26, pleaded guilty to robbing the store in August but most of his family and friends thought he had died tragically in a car accident. The New York Times wrote an article following the incident and said fighting promoters, Rowan's family, and fans were so troubled by his death that they set up fights in Rowan's memory. 1,000 tickets were sold. There was a facebook group dedicated to raising money for Rowan's family. Charles Rowan, 26, 'died' shortly before he was arrested for robbing a Michigan gun store with a hammer . At a memorial service for the fighter, Rowan himself was hiding upstairs in a child's room waiting for the service to end. The Times reports that Rowan was so heartbroken by listening to his family's grief, he thought about ending the service and marching downstairs. Rowan's girlfriend Rosa Martinez sparked rumors of Rowan's death by making a convincing phone call to fight promoter Diponio, saying Rowan was badly injured and needed to be airlifted to a hospital. His own mother thought he was dead. Weeks later, a Gladwin gun store called, 'Guns and Stuff' was robbed and Rowan's face was in the mugshot--to many's surprise. He fled to his mother's house who turned him in to the police. He was also helped by Martinez, and a friend named Micheal Bowman who will be sentenced in January. Rosa Martinez called Rowan's mother and fighting promoter to say he'd died and they believed her story . Why rob the store if he was dead and ready to start his life anew? The fighter, who originally faked his death to escape cocaine debt from his dealer Micheal Gomez, met with the dealer after his 'death' and Gomez told Rowan he would hurt Martinez and her children. That's when out of fear and desperation, Rowan went to the gun store armed with a hammer, and hit the 75-year-old store owner, Richard Robinette, on the head. Gawker reports that Martinez stayed behind and called 911. When Rowan tried calling Martinez, a policeman named James Cuddie answered the phone and asked who he was. Rowan lied and said he was his cousin. The police officer was skeptical and started investigating Rowan's death. Robinette's family said he is said to have recovered miraculously. 'There was a lot of blood,'Rowan said. 'Enough to scare me. I’m a man used to seeing a lot of blood, but that was a lot of blood.' Micheal Bowman assisted Rowan in the robbery and will be sentenced for the crime in January . Unbeknownst to his family, Rowan was a cocaine user and did some work for drug dealers. He allegedly worked for Gomez, who had links to The Latin Kings and The Mexican Mafia Gang, and lost a shipment of cocaine worth $80,000. Rowan told Gomez that thieves jumped him, cracked his ribs, and took his drugs. Gomez wasn't happy with Rowan's story so he arranged for men to beat Rowan up outside of a local Shopko. He was badly beaten, at least that's what Rowan told his friends. A downtrodden Rowan was inspired to start anew after watching a show on the Discovery Channel at his girlfriend Martinez's house about a man who faked his death to start a new life. Rowan had a rich criminal history in addition to owing drug money. Ever since Rowan was a kid he stole 'guns, dumb things, work tools, and money,' Rowan's stepfather Scott Gardner told The New York Times. Friend's and fans payed homage to Rowan after he died with photos like these posted on a friend's facebook page . Rowan had previously been arrested for failure to pay child support and for selling marijuana. He also was arrested on charges of sexual misconduct with a teenager. Rowan was a father of three--all to different women. He also was no stranger to fighting and was beaten by his father for years. The Times reports that Rowan's father would stomp on his head and that when his father was dying of cancer, his father wished the illness on Rowan instead of himself. Rowan was a sort of underdog in the fighting world. He called himself The Freight Train. Fans called him a 'tomato can' a term that alludes to the fact that it was easy to knock Rowan down and that 'red stuff' came out. Another thing--Rowan fought for free. He enjoyed the fight more than the monetary gain. He loved getting hyped in on coke and then going into the cage for a beating that usually ended up in his getting knocked out. 'It’s amazing that guys will get beat up for free,' Christos Piliafas, a top fighter in Michigan, said. 'They just love to fight.' He also said, 'He was a horrible fighter. He just showed up and would fight. He was a great first fight for someone. Despite loving to fight, Rowan had no trouble owning up to his mistakes and expressing remorse. 'All three of us deserved to be punished for what we did,' Rowan said on Monday in a phone interview from jail with The New York Times. 'Unfortunately, my life has been on a downward spiral for a few years,' he said. 'And finally, I just hit the bottom. I hope one day that I can make something of my life and show Mr. Robinette or his family that I learned my lesson,' he concluded.","Charles Rowan, 26, apparently worked for a drug dealer and owed $80,000 a lost cocaine shipment .

The new glasses have been designed to . allow medical professionals (pictured left) to see beneath a person’s skin to they can . more easily locate veins for IV treatment. An image of what a nurse wearing the glasses might see is pictured on the right. The glasses are designed so that medical professional can pick the best vessels . The Eyes-On Glasses System that is used to detect veins has been developed by Evena Medical, an imaging technology firm based in Silicon Valley and Japanese electronics company Epson. They said the glasses are ‘one of the first healthcare applications of smart glasses commercially on a global scale’ as well as the first point-of-care wearable system of hands-free real-time vascular imaging. The glasses are designed to be worn by nurses at the bedside to quickly visualise a patient’s veins and to make intravenous access, ‘fast accurate and precise’. In a promotional video, Evena Medical said its technology means nurses will no longer have to guess which vein is best and the glasses will probably reduce the amount of failed attempts to access a blood vessel, which can be unpleasant for patients. The company said it allows medical practitioners to ‘access the best vein for every patient every time.’ The system is based on Evena Medical's bulkier vascular imaging technology that shows the veins beneath a patient’s skin on a large screen, but now the image can be projected onto the head-mounted display of the glasses. It is hands free and ‘projects overlays of digital content onto the real-world in the centre of the wearer’s field of view … enabling a seamless blend of the physical and digital worlds,’ according to the company. The smart spectacles allow medical practitioners to store images and videos and share them remotely via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and 3G. The glasses use technology from Epson's Moverlo BT-100 glasses (pictured), which have an HD screen for an immersive effect, and claim to let users experience content in new ways . A power supply and belt-mounted computer keeps the glasses lightweight, while multi spectral lighting (which emulates good quality natural light) allows them to pick out fine details ‘on and beneath the skin’. ‘Studies have shown that up to 40 per cent of IV starts require multiple attempts to locate and access a vein, which not only wastes valuable nursing time but also delays therapy and causes patient discomfort and dissatisfaction,’ said Evena CEO Frank Ball. ‘With Evena’s Eyes-On Glasses, nurses can quickly and easily locate and access the best veins for each patient—even in challenging clinical environments.’ The glasses will begin shipping in the first quarter of 2014, according to Digital Trends.

An historic plantation has been destroyed after it was allegedly set on fire by a gang of men on a drug-fueled 'ghost hunt'. Seven men have reportedly admitted burning down the landmark in the early hours of Friday morning after breaking in to look for ghosts and smoke marijuana. The home, which was built in the 1850s near the Mississippi River levee in Old Arabi, was one of just two surviving plantation buildings in Arabi, south of New Orleans. Destroyed: The historic LeBeau plantation, south of New Orleans, was destroyed by fire in the early hours of Friday . Arrests: The fire was allegedly started by seven men who went to the house on a drug-fueled ghost hunt . Ruins: A charred shell is all that is left of the building which dates back to the 1850s . Suspects: The seven suspects charged in connection with the fire line up next to the sheriff's van after their arrest . Dusten Davenport, 31, Joshua Allen, 21, Joshua Briscoe, 20, Joseph Landin, 20, and a 17-year-old have all been charged with arson and simple burglary and criminal damage. Two other men, Kevin Barbe, 20, and Bryon Meek, 29, have been charged with accessory to arson. Barbe has also been charged with criminal trespassing. St Bernard Sheriff James Pohlmann said: 'They were in there looking for ghosts, drinking, smoking dope, and for some reason they made a decision - a conscious decision - before they left to set this building on fire.' He said that the men were door-to-door salesmen. Before: How the historic house had looked before Friday's fire . Gone: Very little remains of the house which has been used as a hotel and illegal casino over the years . The land was first used as a plantation in 1721 and remained as a plantation for the next century or so. For around 30 years in the early 19th century, the land was used as a brickyard. Work began on the house itself when Francoise Barthelemy LeBeau bought the land in 1851. Although it had sixteen rooms, the LeBeau home only had one interior staircase for tax reasons. The building was completed in 1854, but Mr LeBeau died a few months later. The house remained in the LeBeau family until 1905 when it was bought by Friscoville Realty and it was turned into the Friscoville Hotel. Burning: Smoke billows from the building as fire crews begin to dampen down the flames on Friday morning . Security: The owners of the building had installed a security fence around it, but that didn't deter the group of seven men who broke in . The hotel changed hands again in 1928 when it was bought by Jai Alai Realty and renamed the Cardone Hotel. Although it was a hotel by name, the house was reportedly used as an illegal casino - gun turrets built in closets during the prohibition days were said to have survived until Friday's fire. LeBeau house was bought by Joseph Meraux in 1967 but deteriorated badly. A fire damaged the building in 1986 and attempts to restore it continually started but then failed. It wasn't until 2003 that the building was stabilised, but the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in the area put paid to further restoration plans. It is thought that plans were in the pipeline to carry out further work on the home. According to reports, locals had for many years reported seeing a light go on and off in the cupola of the house despite there being no electrical connection. Emergency operation: Firefighters pictured at the scene of the fire on Friday morning . LeBeau house had been owned by the Meraux Foundation which described Friday's fire as a 'tragedy'. In a statement, the foundation said: 'We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our community's most beloved treasures. 'Over the years we have wrestled with determining the best use for the plantation. 'One of our duties as board members is to prioritize our actions in response to community needs. 'Given the millions of dollars required to restore the plantation, prudence dictated that we preserve the plantation while we worked to identify the best path forward. 'The Foundation hired an architect who specializes in historic buildings and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on structural improvements and routine maintenance. 'We made our best efforts to secure the land from trespassers. We installed an eight foot fence around the property and posted signs. 'But it is doubtful that anything short of 24 hour patrols would have kept out these intruders intent on engaging in illegal activities.'","The LeBeau plantation was destroyed by fire early on Friday morning .

Robert F Kennedy feared his children would be blinded by the mafia in an acid attack as revenge attack for investigating them, his widow has revealed. Speaking out for the first time in 30 years, Ethel Kennedy said that her late husband was anxious they would be targeted as retaliation for his probe into mafia racketeering. He saw a report about an American journalist who had been blinded in an acid attack by the mob and feared they would do the same to him. Big Irish family: Robert and Ethel (seen at the back) had 11 children, two of whom died . The disclosure will add to conspiracy theories that the mafia may have been responsible for Kennedy’s death. He was shot dead by Sirhan Sirhan in 1968 but speculation has raged that his crusade against the mob whilst serving as U.S. Attorney General may have be the root of his demise. Mrs Kennedy opened up to promote ‘Ethel’, a new film about her life directed by her daughter Rory, the youngest of her eleven children. Mrs Kennedy, 83, said that her last husband was scared after New York Post journalist Victor Riesel was blinded in an acid attack because of articles he had written about the mob. ‘We were told they were going to do the same with our children,’ she said. Her eldest daughter Kathleen, one of several family members interviewed for the film, added: ‘We couldn’t leave school with the other kids at the end of the day. Camelot continued: Robert Kennedy, seen with Ethel, was the attorney general when JFK was president . ‘We had to wait in the principal’s office to be picked up.’ The conspiracy theories relating to the . mob and the Kennedy family usually involve New Orleans mafia don Carlos . Marcello, who was deported to Guatemala by Mr Kennedy in 1961 after he . was appointed Attorney General by his brother John. Ethel Kennedy, now 83, gave her first interview in years in order to promote her daughter Rory's documentary about her life . Afterwards Marcello is said to have threatened John F Kennedy with the traditional Sicilian curse ‘Take the stone from my shoe’. And when the President died, Marcello associate Jimmy Hoffa is supposed to have said: ‘This means Bobby is out as Attorney General.’ The film about Mrs Kennedy also gives a rare glimpse into life inside Camelot and amusing details, such as how Mr Kennedy slid down the White House bannister when his brother became president. She reveals that it was very hard for her husband to seek office for the first time and that he had to ‘struggle for everything’ before becoming a senator in New York in 1964. There is also colour about her own life including how she held wild parties which President Kennedy asked her to tone down, and that she was once charged with horse theft after she rescued a neighbour’s malnourished stallions.

Residents indicated they will call on their former neighbours, Kate and Wills, to fight fracking . No sooner do I reveal that Prince William is pining for a quiet refuge for his family on Anglesey than I discover he is in danger of being dragged into a row there over mineral and mining rights — and possibly fracking. It follows letters sent to 4,000 residents over manorial rights to the island, which were bought by a former policeman more than 20 years ago. Stephen Hayes, 67, bought rights covering 10,350 acres of Anglesey where William enjoyed his first two years of married life with Kate while working as a search and rescue helicopter pilot. But now the Land Registry has written to homeowners there, alerting them to the registration of the manorial title which, apparently, gives its owner interest in mineral and mining concerns. Since this has never happened before, locals are worried, not least because they fear these might involve fracking. One says: ‘It may be that William can help us in this.’ Only last week there was a ‘peasants’ revolt’ after the Marquess of Salisbury, the former Tory leader in the House of Lords, sent a letter to homeowners in Welwyn Garden City claiming his rights in respect of ‘mines and minerals’ beneath their homes. In Wales, politicians have asked First Minister Carwyn Jones to end these ancient rights, which are often bought by wealthy eccentrics to give themselves a  decorative lord of the manor title. The title for the Manor of Treffos in Anglesey was bought in 1992. ‘I was at a property auction in Manchester and by chance the title came up,’ says Hayes, who theoretically could call himself Lord Treffos. ‘I bought it with no research purely for a commercial reason, which fell through. Under attack? Stephen Hayes, who owns the 10,350 acres covering the royal home, has rights to mine . Neighbourly: The couple had a strong relationship with the community. Here Kate is pictured accepting gifts . ‘I regarded it as worthless until the Government, in recognising mineral values as a result of fracking, appear to have decided to put all the manorial titles in order and insisted they be registered.’ He says he is £40,000 out of pocket ‘for something I bought on chance’. Hayes adds: ‘I have spoken to some locals and told them I am happy to sell back the title to residents, some of whom are elderly and very distressed. ‘I would do this at a nominal figure if they joined together.’","Royal couple's Anglesey neighbours warned landowner has mining rights .

Chuka Umunna employed unpaid interns while campanging for fairer wages, it has emerged . Labour rising star Chuka Umunna employed unpaid interns while campaigning for fairer salaries, it emerged yesterday. The party’s business spokesman was accused of ‘hypocrisy’ by pushing for a ‘living wage’ when some of own staff received only expenses such as the cost of lunch and travel. Asked by the BBC Sunday Politics programme whether he paid at least the UK minimum of £7.45 an hour, he said: ‘Yes absolutely, of course I do.’ But in August 2010 he advertised for two staff, one for his Commons office and one at his Streatham constituency, to work four days a week from 10am to 6pm for ‘expenses’. In November the same year he offered an internship in his constituency office on the same terms – and again in February 2011 for a part-time role receiving ‘lunch and travel expenses’. Mr Umunna also told the programme that only 20 Labour councils had agreed to pay the living wage – £8.55 in London and £7.45 in the rest of Britain – to its staff. The controversy comes as Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday pledged that businesses that sign up to pay the living wage will be given a 12-month tax break worth up to £1,000 for each worker. In a speech tomorrow, the Labour leader will set out how tackling low wages is key to solving squeezed living standards. Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover, said: ‘This shows amazing hypocrisy. They want businesses to pay everyone more – as long as they don’t have to do it themselves.’ 'It's the same old Labour: do as I say, not as I do.' However, a senior Labour source said: ‘We believe in work experience. We also believe in a living wage so people can get higher pay to do a job. They are very different things.’ Mr Umunna also revealed on the Sunday Politics programme that only 20 . Labour councils had agreed to pay the living wage to its staff. His leader Ed Miliband yesterday pledged that businesses that sign up to paying the living wage will be given a 12 month tax break worth up to £1,000 for each worker. The living wage is the minimum amount a person can live on for a basic standard of living. Currently it is defined as £8.55 in London and £7.45 in the rest of Britain. At the weekend, Mr Miliband pledged to introduce make work pay contracts to raise wages for millions of low-paid workers if he wins the next election. Labour party leader Ed Miliband has pledged that businesses paying the living wage will receive tax breaks worth up to £1,000 per worker . For each low paid member of staff . whose earnings are boosted, firms would receive a tax rebate worth . around £445 on average although it could potentially reach £1,000. In . a major speech next week, the Labour leader will set out how tackling . low wages is key to solving the squeezed living standards. He will warn that Britain risks 'an era of growth without prosperity' as wages stagnate while household costs continue to rise. 'Ordinary families are doing much worse than the averages would suggest because people at the top continue to enjoy faster wage rises than everyone else,' he will say. 'For ordinary families to keep up, we don't need average wages to just creep higher than prices. That will still leave millions of people worse off.' Companies that sign up to the make work pay contracts in the first year after the election will receive back 12-months' worth of the resulting increased tax and National Insurance revenues received by the Government. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has criticised Labour's proposals suggesting there would be 'a substantial extra cost to the exchequer or to business' Any extra savings in lower tax credits and benefit payments, along with increased tax revenues in future years, would be used to cut social security bills and help pay down the deficit. But the Tories pointed out that three years ago, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls had cast doubt on the living wage idea, saying: 'It seems to me that there would be a substantial extra cost either to the exchequer or to business'. They also said it would be a bureaucratic nightmare and involve substantial extra administration costs, because the government would have to check the payroll for millions of individuals to ensure firms were in line for the rebate. Last night the Confederation of British Industry welcomed the fact that Labour was not planning raising the minimum wage to the living wage level. Chief policy director Katja Hall said: 'We are pleased that Labour is taking a voluntary approach to the living wage. The minimum wage acts as a floor on pay, protecting workers. 'This scheme may help some firms pay more, but many companies simply can't afford it. 'The best way to boost wage growth in the longer term is to build a sustainable recovery and invest in the productivity growth that will boost wages.'","Labour Business spokesman advertised internships which paid only lunch and travel expenses .

'Pathetic': Labour leader Ed Miliband has come under fire for his bid to shift blame over the Paul Flowers scandal . Ed Miliband was described as ‘pathetic’ yesterday after he accused David Cameron of smear tactics and plotting to run the ‘dirtiest election campaign’ in decades. The Labour leader said the Prime Minister was ‘demeaning his office’ with a political strategy to ‘sling as much mud as possible in the hope that some of it sticks’. His outburst follows weeks of negative headlines for the Labour Party, from the vote-rigging scandal in Falkirk to last week’s revelations about former Co-op chairman Paul Flowers, a former Labour councillor who was arrested as part of a drugs inquiry. Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said Mr Miliband’s complaints showed the party could not take scrutiny and tended to ‘clam up’ when facing difficult questions. The Labour leader said in an article for the Independent on Sunday: ‘David Cameron used to claim he wanted to change his party and lead it back to the middle ground. ‘That project has now entirely  disappeared. This is a Conservative Party preparing to fight the dirtiest general  election campaign that we have seen in this country for over 20 years.’ Accusing the Tories of employing tactics of ‘smear and character assassination’, he wrote that at last Wednesday’s Prime  Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron had ‘hit a new low by trying to use the gross errors and misconduct of one man, Paul Flowers, to impugn the integrity of the entire Labour movement’. Conservative chairman Grant Shapps expressed his surprise that Labour, whose spin doctor Damian McBride was forced to resign in 2009 after he sent emails  discussing plans to smear senior Tories, was accusing anyone of dirty politics. ‘This is a pathetic attempt to evade the serious issues. Labour have big questions to answer, and when they are asked, they simply try to avoid them by claiming they are smears,’ he said. ‘It is an obvious tactic from the party that brought you the most disgraceful smear operation of modern times, fronted by Damian McBride, and known about, encouraged and tolerated by Ed Balls and Ed Miliband. And McBride was simply the latest in a long line of bullying Labour spin doctors, including Alastair Campbell and Charlie Whelan. Movie night: Disgraced Paul Flowers goes to the cinema in Liverpool with Ian Hu on Thursday night . ‘Incredibly, Labour’s new campaign chief Michael Dugher used to be McBride’s right-hand man – it’s the same old Labour. We suggest they explain how the corruption at Falkirk happened, and how the Rev Flowers was allowed to become and remain an adviser, rather than dismiss legitimate questions as smears.’ Mr Gove criticised the Labour leader for his ‘coquettish reticence’ in dealing with the scandals. He said it was hypocritical of Labour not to expect to have to answer questions about Paul Flowers, but he insisted there was no Tory plan to fight a dirty campaign. ‘We need to have lots of questions: that’s why the Chancellor of the Exchequer took the advice of independent people to set up an inquiry, which will ask searching questions about what went on right up to the moment that we discovered everything we discovered about Paul Flowers,’ he said. ‘The difficulty Labour has is they were the people responsible for appointing, or allowing Flowers to be appointed, on their watch.’ Mr Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that when it came to questions over the Unite official at the centre of the Falkirk vote-rigging probe, Labour ‘tend to clam up’. Shameless Paul Flowers allegedly tried to acquire cocaine last week – after he was exposed on camera trying to  buy drugs and after promising to seek professional help. He phoned a dealer on Tuesday and asked for drugs. He reportedly invited the dealer to stay with him in Liverpool and said ‘turn up and if you want to bring the boy Charlie, that’s fine too’.  Charlie is Flowers’s habitual name for cocaine. Keeping a clean nose: Rev Paul Flowers last week . ‘I had absolutely no doubt Paul was referring to coke,’ the dealer told The Mail on Sunday. ‘He always used that word for it.’ After the publication of a video showing him handing over £300 to buy cocaine  and other illegal drugs, former Co-op  Bank chairman Flowers apologised for his ‘stupid and wrong’ actions in a statement made through the Methodist church last Sunday. He also vowed to seek help for  his problem. The convicted dealer claimed Flowers had admitted using drugs since 2010 – which covers most of his time at the  Co-op Bank – and the former Methodist minister allegedly admitted he didn’t believe in God. ‘Paul’s been a really heavy user of coke and ketamine for a long time,’ the dealer added. ‘I laughed when I saw his statement saying he was getting professional help. The only professional help he was seeking was from a professional drug fixer – me.’ The dealer said Flowers ‘sniffed a line of coke’ on Remembrance Sunday morning before going to a service in Bradford. Flowers has not been home since the scandal broke eight days ago and has been reportedly staying with fellow Methodist minister Ian Hu, 51, in Liverpool. They went to the cinema on Thursday. Further details of his debauched lifestyle are revealed in a string of texts he sent in recent weeks to his drug dealer. On the day he was due to appear before a Commons committee about the Co-op’s performance, he texted to say he has taken drugs and plans a night touring the gay bars of Bradford looking for ‘lots of likely lads’. In the days before his exposure in The Mail on Sunday, Flowers texted about watching porn and taking drugs. He also texted his dealer about a 17-year-old straight student he likes and suggests the teenager watches him having sex.","Labour leader said PM was 'demeaning his office' and had political strategy to 'sling .

A psychology professor is facing a possible life sentence after being charged with playing a role in the 1995 murder of a man she says raped her as a college student. Norma Esparza, 39, claims she was forced to identify Gonzalo Ramirez as her attacker to her ex-boyfriend Gianni Van. Van went on to get revenge for the sexual assault by kidnapping Mr Ramirez and stabbing him to death. Ms Esparza, from California now living in France, today proclaimed her innocence before she was taken into custody in Orange County. Accused: Norma Esparza, 39, is facing jail for the 1995 murder of a man she identified to her ex-boyfriend as her rapist, after which her ex killed him as revenge . She says she never reported the rape and after the murder of Mr Ramirez she lived in fear of Van. The mother-of-one has now been jailed after rejecting a manslaughter plea deal offered by prosecutors who allege she encouraged the murder of Ramirez by pointing him out to Van at a Santa Ana bar 18 years ago. Professor Esparza claims she was raped by Ramirez and after telling ex-boyfriend Gianni Van about the alleged assault, Van ‘took matters into his own hands’ with a group of friends, her husband Jorge Mancillas said. She claims to have been taken by Van to see a bloodied, but alive, Ramirez after which she was threatened with a gun to make her promise to stay silent. Van told her they had released Ramirez but Esparza learned when she was interviewed by police weeks later that he had been killed, Mr Mancillas said. After this she was pressured to marry Van so she could not be bound to testify against him. Not guilty plea: Ms Esparza, pictured with her daughter Arianna, is accused of endorsing the 1995 murder, but she claims to have had nothing to do with the actions her ex-husband took after she identified her rapist . ‘All I knew is, that I wanted to survive,’ she said at news conference earlier this week. ‘All I knew was that these people were dangerous and I just needed to stay quiet and withdraw and come out of that night alive.’ Upon graduating and obtaining a doctorate, she eventually moved to Europe to teach and divorced Van to marry Mr Mancillas, with whom she has a four-year-old daughter. Last year when she returned to the U.S. she was charged with murder with special circumstances and jailed for two months until she was released on $300,000 bail in a special deal with prosecutors that let her live in Europe while returning to Orange County for court. Her lawyer said Ms Esparza's reluctance to report the alleged crime nearly two decades ago has her facing a murder charge for the stabbing death of the man she says raped her. ‘If you ever get raped or touched, make sure you report it to police,’ defense attorney Bob Corrado told reporters. ‘If she had done that she wouldn't be here today.’ Living in fear: Professor Esparza, with her husband, Jorge Mancillas, who now teaches at a university in Switzerland, claim she was pressured into marrying her killer ex-boyfriend so she could not testify against him after he murdered Mr Ramirez . Van and two others were indicted with help from Esparza's testimony in grand jury proceedings earlier this year. ‘She actively encouraged this crime,’ said Scott Simmons, senior deputy district attorney. He declined to discuss the facts of the case. Prosecutors had offered to let Esparza plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter and take a three-year prison sentence, of which she would have most likely served half. She declined the offer Thursday morning, and was jailed by Judge Gerald G. Johnston. Flanked by Mancillas and the couple's daughter, a soft-spoken but firm Esparza said she could not plead guilty to something she did not do. ‘The principle of what they're asking me is to plead guilty to something that they know I am not responsible for,’ she said. ‘It would essentially be a lie.’","Norma Esparza, 39, faces a possible life sentence for the 1995 murder .

The truck carrying Ronald Lee Mohr and Richard William Koester went off U.S. Highway 50 and into a ravine about 85 miles south of Denver on October 11, Fremont County Coroner Carlette Brocious said. A Colorado Department of Transportation worker spotted the pickup on Thursday. Mohr - the driver - had died of his injuries while Koester has since been hospitalized with serious injuries. Richard Koester, pictured here in a photograph released by the Fremont County Sheriff's office, survived for six days next to his dead friend after their truck crashed in Colorado. Koester beat the crash and freezing conditions to stay alive . 'They were down in a culvert and you just couldn't see them from the road,' Brocious said. 'It was just wonderful that the CDOT worker found them when he was looking over the guardrail.' Brocious said the men had only long sleeves and light jackets to guard against the cold. She didn't know how Koester, 36, of Westcliffe, survived the week as temperatures at night hovered around freezing and light rain moved through the area. 'They didn't have any food in there that I saw,' she said. 'I just think he had an angel looking over his shoulder.' Dead: the body of Ronald Mohr, pictured here in a photograph released by the Fremont County Sheriff's office, lay for six days next to friend Richard Koester, who survived the truck crash. Mohr was driving the truck that crashed near Denver Colorado . The crash took place five miles west of Canon City in an area marked by scrubby vegetation and canyonlands. Mohr, 59, of Silver Cliff, and Koester were reported missing when they didn't return from a trip to Cripple Creek, a historic Rocky Mountain mining town now popular for its casinos.","Truck plunges into ravine as friends return from Rocky Mountain mining town now popular for its casinos .

In a second blow for the product, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has found that babies can too easily wiggle out of the floor seats leaving themselves vulnerable to injury. The news follows a previous warning that the seats were dangerous if placed on raised surfaces.

About 1 million of the molded foam seats . were recalled in October 2007 for additional warning labels against . placing the Bumbo seats on tables or kitchen . counters. Since the first recall, CPSC and Bumbo International of South Africa have learned of at least 50 incidents in which babies fell from Bumbo seats while they were being used on raised surfaces.

In a statement, the company said it was adding a restraint belt to enhance the safety of children using the Bumbo seat. 'The restraint belt will help prevent children from getting out of or falling from the seat when it is used as intended: on the floor with adult supervision and never on raised surfaces,' said the statement. 'The health and safety of children using the Bumbo Baby Seat are our top priorities.'

If you want to get in shape by unleashing your inner Rocky while feeling like you're in a scene from Flashdance then Piloxing is for you. Pil-what-ing? It might sound like a vaccination programme or a take on the vintage pill box hat but Piloxing actually is the hot, new way to get fit. The workout combines moves from Pilates and boxing so it's both fat-burning and body sculpting. Scroll down for video . Fusion: Viveca Jensen, second from left, came up with Piloxing - combining Pilates with boxing . Weighted gloves are worn to work the muscles further and, like the popular Zumba class, all the moves are performed in time with a pumping music track. Gemma Simmonds, a learning and development manager from London, attended a Piloxing class run at Push Studios in East Dulwich. She was a Zumba devotee but was keen to try something new to keep her motivated and having full while exercising. She said of Piloxing: 'The class sounded like the perfect way to continue to tone my troublesome areas - arms and stomach - so I signed up straight away. Jab and dance: Women take part in a Piloxing class in Push Studios in London . 'It isn't for the faint hearted, I used to come out of Zumba bright red and sweating, and this is even more intense. 'It is interval training which combines boxing, standing Pilates, even a little bit of dance, and all at 145 beats a minute, which is exhausting but gets the endorphins going. I am hooked and it now forms a key part of my fitness regime.' Shara Tochia, 28, from Clerkenwell, London, has also tried Piloxing and has seen an increase in booking for the classes via her website Fitness-freak.com. She said: 'Piloxing is a combination of two great fitness disciplines, boxing and pilates. An all over body workout starting at your core.

As with many fitness trends, Piloxing first took the U.S. by storm and is now expected to take off over here, attracting gym goers who love classes like Zumba but are looking for a new challenge. Celebrities including Vanessa Hudgens, Hilary Duff and Glee's Heather Morris are said to be fans of the class.

She told She Knows Health and Wellness: 'Piloxing is a fitness program that blends the best of Pilates, boxing and dance into a high-energy interval workout that incorporates interval and barefoot training to burn maximum calories and increase stamina. 'At the core of Piloxing is the principle that women are powerful and can boost their self-esteem by taking charge of their own health.' She added: 'There have been times in my life where I've been put in a situation which made me feel weak and let down, so my mission through creating the Piloxing program was to empower women and let them know it's OK to feel strong and beautiful in their own skin, even in times when we don't feel so strong or confident.'","Work out is both fat-burning and body sculpting .

It might sound like a nightmare scenario from a science fiction film, but one expert has claimed that China is planning on transforming the moon into a missile base. The expert, from the China National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration Programme Centre, told a Chinese newspaper that the moon could be used as a military base from which to fire missiles at the Earth. The alleged plans have been likened to the creation of the Death Star in the Star Wars films, a fictional space station capable of destroying planets with its giant laser and home to a huge army led by Darth Vader. Comparisons of China's alleged plans have been drawn with the Death Star in the Star Wars films (pictured), which is a fictional space station capable of destroying planets with its giant laser and home to a super army led by Darth Vader . The Beijing Times reported that discussions are ongoing in China as to whether the People’s Liberation Army could establish a missile base on the moon. One expert told the newspaper that the Earth’s natural satellite could be turned into a giant weapon, which could be used as a military base where missiles could be directed at targets on Earth, Want China Times reported. The English news website  compared the alleged plans to the building of the Death Star in Star Wars. The expert reportedly told the website that weapons testing sites could be set up on the moon but also that the Earth's satellite could become a base used to send crafts out to deep space. Earlier this week China launched its March-3B rocket carrying the Chang'e-3 lunar rover, which is known as Jade Rabbit and plans to send its first astronaut to the moon by 2030. The country hopes it will become the first country in almost 40 years to soft-land a probe on the moon. The Beijing Times reported that discussions are ongoing in China as to whether the People's Liberation Army could establish a missile base on the moon. Here, soldiers watch the live broadcast of the lift-off of the Long March-3B carrier rocket carrying China's Chang'e-3 lunar probe on December 2, 2013 in Jinan, China . The nation is only the third in history to launch an unmanned lunar probe after the Chang'e-3 device, nicknamed 'Jade Rabbit' after a Chinese folklore character, set off at 5.30pm on Sunday evening (1.30am local time). The lunar probe blasted off on board an enhanced Long March-3B carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China's southwestern Sichuan province. The probe, which can climb inclines of up to 30 degrees and travel up to 200 metres per hour, is targeted to land within a huge volcanic crater known as Sinus Iridum, which means the Bay of Rainbows, on about December 14. The mission is a huge step forward for its ambitious space programme and forms part of a plan in which China hopes to build a permanent lunar base in order to launch future missions to Mars within the next 15 years. An expert, from the China National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration Programme Centre, told a Chinese newspaper that the moon could be used as a military base from which to fire missiles at the Earth . President Xi Jinping has said he wants China to establish itself as a space superpower, and the mission has inspired widespread pride in China's growing technological prowess. State television showed a live broadcast of the rocket lifting off. If all goes smoothly, the rover will conduct geological surveys and search for natural resources after the probe touches down on the moon in mid-December. It is designed to roam the lunar surface for at least 90 Earth days – three Lunar days – covering an area of about five square kilometres. It will send probes beneath the surface as well as taking high-resolution images of the rock, a flat area formed from the molten basalt released by lunar volcanoes several billion years ago. The journey of the probe and its final landing is being closely monitored by the European Space Agency (ESA), which is cooperating closely with China.

According to an ad in Craigslist, the man is looking for a male roommate who is willing to be naked all the time and be fine with ‘some touching’. Indecent proposal: The tenant says he's looking for a 'very attractive' male roommate willing to be naked and must be fine with 'some touching' but 'mostly looking' Good looking and young: The ad says the potential applicants should be 26 or younger and 'very attractive' (file photo) ‘Want to live in a penthouse in Chinatown for basically free ($1/month rent to make lease legal)?

An attorney for the woman found dead in a San Francisco General Hospital stairwell disputed on Saturday a coroner's report saying her death was probably due to a chemical imbalance related to chronic alcohol abuse. The medical examiner's office said Friday that Lynne Spalding, who was found 17 days after she went missing from her room at San Francisco General Hospital died accidentally, probably due to a chemical imbalance related to chronic alcohol abuse. Haig Harris asserted that Spalding's death wasn't related to alcoholism and insisted that she died of starvation or dehydration. Report: Police had the wrong racial description for British-born Lynne Spalding, 57, and waited days to share surveillance footage from the day she went missing . Negligence: Investigators are seen in the stairwell of San Francisco General Hospital, left, where the body of Lynne Spalding, right, was found nine days after she went missing . 'To suggest alcoholism was involved is an outrageous, gratuitous comment,' Harris told the San Francisco Chronicle a day after the medical examiner's report was released. Spalding, 57, was found in a locked stairwell on October 8. The coroner's report said she died accidentally and the cause was 'probable electrolyte imbalance with delirium' because of 'complications of chronic ethanolism.' She had been admitted to the hospital Sept. 19 with a urinary infection, and she also had an altered mental state for one to two months and weight loss for two weeks, the report said. Two days after she was admitted, she disappeared from her hospital room. Spalding was confused and delirious that day, the report said. She didn't know the day or time or even why she was in the hospital, according to the report, which also said her laboratory test results were consistent with 'alcoholic liver disease.' No alcohol problem: Lynne Spalding did not have an alcohol problem, says her family's lawyer . Discovery: Ms Spalding's body was still on the premises and was found by a hospital employee in a stairwell . Her decomposing remains weren't found . until two-and-a-half weeks later, when a maintenance worker walked down . the stairwell during his quarterly inspection. Harris . said the mention of alcoholism 'demeans the memory of this woman, . without telling us when she died, how long she was out there suffering.' He said Spalding drank wine nightly and had suffered weight loss from not eating. David Perry, a family spokesman who knew Spalding for six years, denied Friday that Spalding ever had an alcohol problem. 'Lynne was certainly not an alcoholic nor was she in any program that I was aware of,' he said. Perry said he was disappointed that no time of death was released. 'The . only issue is did she die on September 21 or sometime later,' he said. 'If the answer is she died after September 21, then her family and . friends feel that Lynne Spalding was killed through the neglect and . malfeasance of San Francisco General Hospital and the San Francisco . Sheriff's Department.' Investigation: A missing person's inquiry was launched after Ms Spalding first went missing . An after-hours call to the medical examiner's office was not immediately returned. The . hospital said it has instituted a number of measures after Spalding's . death, including daily stairwell checks and new training for security . staff. Several employees . with the San Francisco Sheriff's Department, which provides hospital . security, were reassigned after Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi acknowledged that . a thorough search was never conducted for Spalding. At the time of her disappearance, family spokesman David Perry told ABC that Ms Spalding was on medication, which could have caused her to become disorientated. Ms Spalding, who was originally from the UK but lived in San Francisco, worked in tourism in the West Coast city. She was divorced with two children, a 23-year-old daughter and 19-year-old son.","The medical examiner found that Lynne Spalding, 57, died accidentally, probably due to a chemical imbalance caused by chronic alcohol abuse .

Daniel Arnold and Stephan Siegrist are professional alpine explorers with years of experience in tackling some of the world's most intense ascents. They teamed up with climbing photographer Thomas Senf and Swiss mountain sports manufacturer Mammut to create this set of unique images inside frozen waterfalls of Norway. Ice blue: Daniel Arnold and Stephan Siegrist worked in the glacial surroundings of the Eidfjord in Norway . The pictures were taken in on the Eidfjord in northern Norway, using coloured flares, spotlights and headlamps. The . terrain, three hours east of the city of Bergen, is famous for the . large number of icefalls - frozen waterfalls which can reach heights of . over 500 metres.

Grace Newton, 24, wrote 'watching s*** TV' and 'heroin's treating me well' on her Looking for Work form at the Stockton Jobcentre to see if the bogus entries would be noticed. She claims the forms were then signed off by a worker at the centre, who she accuses of being more interested in paperwork than finding her a job. Grace Newton, 24, became annoyed with staff at her local Jobcentre after she felt they were more interested in filling out paperwork than finding her a job . Ms Newton started putting joke entries such as 'This is your last chance to pretend you care about my future' to see if they would be noticed . In the ‘What will I do next?’ section she wrote, ‘Continue to do this pointless bull so I can get the dole’ and ‘Top myself’, and in the ‘What happened’ column she penned, ‘I wondered what your particular stance was on prostitution’ and ‘Heard from ..... drum roll .... no-one!’ In another entry she put 'This is your . last chance for you to pretend you care about my future', following it . up in the What Happened column with 'I stared intently into your eyes.' Ms Newton left her last job as a barmaid in London after she was unable to get time off to arrange her father's funeral . She said: 'I began unemployment if possible, positively. I was positive about my job prospects but I found the experience of going to the Jobcentre completely demoralising. 'I felt my advisor was totally disinterested and I received little encouragement, help or guidance.' Ms Newton began looking for work near her home town of Fishburn, County Durham, after leaving her barmaid's job in London last year. She needed time off to arrange her father's funeral, but was told her employer couldn't hold the job, so she quit. Since then she has used her spare time to research internships, fill out application forms, and go to interviews. But her efforts went unrewarded, and a short time later the Jobcentre called and asked her to correct her application form, a move she describes as 'the last straw'. She added: 'This was in a fortnight when I received responses from seven job applications and travelled to London three times for interviews. 'It’s like all they care about is how the form looks rather than what is written inside.' A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said the advisor categorically denied the entries were on the form. When told of the Jobcentre Plus’ response, Mrs Newton said: 'Why would I add things in afterwards? I have more productive things to do with my time.' The DWP spokesperson said: 'Every day Jobcentre Plus advisors across the country successfully help people move off benefits and into work. 'Advisors are focused on making sure people get all the help and support they need.

Correctional Institution in Carrabelle, Florida, on September 27 after submitting a forged order from a judge that reduced his sentence from life in prison to time served. Days later, Charles Walker, also 34, used the same paperwork to get his sentence 'reduced' to time served, as well. He was released on October 8. The men were so convinced that their . scheme had worked, they showed up at another correction facility to . register as ex-cons that had been released into the community. Scroll down for video . Two convicted murders Joseph Jenkins (left) and Charles Walker (right) are on the run after being accidentally released from a Florida prison in the last month . Now, both men are in the wind. The addresses they gave on their voluntary criminal registration forms were bogus.

Florida judge revealed today that two murderers serving life sentences . have been released accidentally from prison after forging his signature . on his letterhead notepaper. Chief . Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the Casey Anthony trial, believes . that the two inmates had outside help in forging the documents. Judge Perry told the Orlando Sentinel today: 'I strongly believe they had some help. It is unlikely [the documents] were produced by the inmates.' However he has few leads on who might have falsified the documents and it is unclear how they were filed. Investigations are ongoing. Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the Casey Anthony trial, had his signature forged on fake court documents that led to the early release of two convicted murderers . The court orders appeared legitimate, said Judy Perry,  with the county seal, letterheads and identical formatting to real papers. Whoever created the documents had 'elementary knowledge', according to the judge. Walker was serving life for a second-degree murder committed in Orange County in April 1999. He told investigators at the time that he had intended to frighten 23-year-old Cedric Slater whom he said had been intimidating him. Walker fired three shots, one of which struck Slater and killed him. Jenkins was also serving life in prison for the first-degree murder of a father of six in Orlando in September 1998. Jenkins and his cousin Angelo Pearson had planned a home invasion at the home of Roscoe Pugh, 28. The father of six died from gunshot wounds. Pearson is also serving a life sentence at the Wakulla Correctional Institution in Crawfordville.

A desperate manhunt is now underway to find the two escapees who both have extensive criminal histories. At least one of the escaped convicts could be in Orange County because he once lived there. The Florida Department of Corrections is investigating how authorities were duped by the fake documents. Spokeswoman Jessica Cary told the Orlando Sentinel: 'I don't know how it happened.'

A cramped flat at the top of a 31-storey tower block might seem an undesirable prospect even for those on a lengthy council housing waiting list. So it seems incredible that a property matching this description is on the market for £375,000. The fact it is at the summit of the 322ft Trellick Tower helps explain the steep asking price. Rising from the fashionable landscape of West London’s Notting Hill, this Brutalist tower is possibly the most famous social housing block in Britain. The three-bedroom flat’s vendors, Monica Merabet, 50, a former airline worker, and her husband Abdulhafid, 53, a bus driver, brought up their three daughters and son in the flat, moving in as council tenants in 1995 and buying it under the right-to-buy scheme three years later. Room with a view: Monica Merabet is selling her three-bedroom flat on the top floor of famous Notting Hill council block Trellick Tower for £375,000 . They say their children, Maria, 29, Joanna, 25, Halima, 20 and Hafid, 18, who still lives in the 780 sq ft flat, loved growing up in the property so much they begged them not to put it on the market. They must have a head for heights as the flat’s balcony, which faces south, is not for vertigo sufferers. ‘You see the sun rise on one side of the flat and set on the other,’ says Monica. ‘You can see as far as Kent and Hertfordshire and all the main London landmarks such as the London Eye, the BT Tower and the Shard. ‘This is a great area to live in with Portobello Market on our doorstep and great schools, sports facilities, shops and hospitals nearby.’ Trellick Tower was built by the Hungarian-born Modernist architect Erno Goldfinger, whose surname was borrowed by James Bond author Ian Fleming for his villain in the 1959 book of the same name.

He saw his design as the future for modern housing. The tower is built in a narrow oblong with a separate lift tower linked at every third storey to the main block. Inside, the flats were built to dovetail each other. Where one flat had a front door at the top of a staircase leading down to the living area, next door would always have the opposite design with the front door at the base of the stairs. This was intended to reduce noise transmitting between the apartments. But by the time the block was completed in 1972, high-rises were becoming unpopular with council tenants because they attracted crime and anti-social behaviour. Trellick’s fortunes started to rise following the formation of a residents’ committee in the Eighties. A door-entry intercom system was introduced and a concierge employed. With security improved, and the right-to-buy scheme in place, many of the flats changed from council to private ownership. Now 45 of the 217 flats are privately owned. In 1998 the tower was Grade II listed. Having paid £65,000 for the flat, after a £50,000 discount under right- to-buy, Monica has done well out of the Tower’s rising popularity. Bond's villain a hero of housing: Modernist architecht Erno Goldfinger in front of the the council housing block with the tower on the left . But there is a £3,000-a-year service charge and the building’s private residents face a bill for the insulation of the roof and power-hosing the outside walls. This is under negotiation but stands at £16,000 per flat. Gary Saunders, of selling agents Westways, also points out that obtaining a mortgage on a flat in a high-rise isn’t straightforward. He says: ‘Funding can be difficult for flats in local authority high-rise tower blocks. But love it or hate it, Trellick Tower will continue to dominate the skyline over what is likely to be the trendiest area in West London for many years to come.’ Monica is fast to allay fears about unreliable lifts and crime that some may have about living in a high-rise. ‘We have never had any problems with crime,’ she says. ‘And the lifts have only broken down once in the whole time we have lived here. I once went through a fitness phase and ran up and down the staircase for training. You wouldn’t believe how quickly I got fit.’ Westways, 020 7286 5757, westwaysuk.com .","Trellick Tower is one of Britain's most famous council housing blocks .

"PUBLISHED: . 20:50 EST, 19 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:08 EST, 20 November 2013 . JPMorgan Chase & Co has tentatively agreed to pay $13 billion to settle allegations surrounding the quality of mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. If the agreement is finalized it would be the government's highest-profile enforcement action related to the financial meltdown that plunged the economy into the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. A source familiar with negotiations between the bank and federal government said Attorney General Eric Holder, Associate Attorney General Tony West, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and the bank's general counsel, Stephen Cutler, negotiated the tentative settlement in a Friday night phone call. Scroll down for video . Deal: JP Morgan Chase has tentatively agreed to $13bn agreement over mortgage-backed securities . The source, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been finalized, said the tentative agreement does not resolve a criminal investigation of the bank's conduct. It is being handled by federal prosecutors in Sacramento, California. On Friday night, Mr Holder told the bank that a non-prosecution agreement was a non-starter,  meaning that the Justice Department will continue to conduct the criminal investigation of the financial institution. As part of the deal, the Justice Department expects JP Morgan to cooperate with the continuing criminal inquiry into the bank's issuance of mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007, the source said. JP Morgan spokesman Brian Marchiony and Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon declined to comment. Of the $13 billion, fines and penalties will use up $9 billion and $4 billion will go to consumer relief for struggling homeowners, the source claimed. Inquiry: Bank CEO Jamie Dimon testifies before the House financial services hearing in June 2012 . Conference call: Attorney General Eric Holder is said to have negotiated the deal in a Friday night phone call . When the housing bubble burst in 2007, bundles of mortgages sold as securities soured and the investors who bought them lost billions. In the aftermath, public outrage boiled over that no high-level Wall Street executives had been sent to jail. Some lawmakers and other critics demanded that the big bailed-out banks and senior executives be held accountable. Negotiations: Security and Exchange Commission head Stephen Cutler is also said to have been involved in the $13 bn deal . In response, the government in January 2012 set up a task force of federal and state law enforcement officials to pursue wrongdoing with regard to mortgage securities. In September, JP Morgan agreed to pay $920 million and admit that it failed to oversee trading that led to a $6 billion loss last year in its London operation. That combined amount, in settlements with three U.S. and one British regulator, is one of the largest fines ever levied against a financial institution. In another case, the company agreed to pay a $100 million penalty and admitted that its traders acted 'recklessly' with the London trades. In August, the Justice Department accused Bank of America Corp, the second-largest U.S. bank, of civil fraud in failing to disclose risks and misleading investors in its sale of $850 million in mortgage bonds in 2008. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a related lawsuit. The government estimates that investors lost more than $100 million on the deal. Bank of America disputes the allegations. The latest action against JP Morgan brought the weight of the Obama administration against the bank, which has enjoyed a reputation for managing risk better than its Wall Street competitors. JP Morgan came through the financial crisis in better shape than most of its rivals and Mr Dimon, its chief executive, charmed lawmakers and commanded the attention of regulators in Washington. A number of banks, including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, previously have been accused of abuses in sales of securities linked to mortgages in the years leading up to the crisis. Together they have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties to settle civil charges brought by the SEC, which accused them of deceiving investors about the quality of the bonds they sold. JP Morgan settled SEC charges in June 2011 by agreeing to pay $153.6 million and reached another such agreement for $296.9 million in November last year. The banks in all the SEC cases were allowed to neither admit nor deny wrongdoing - a practice that brought criticism of the agency from judges and investor advocates. But in a first for a major company, JP Morgan admitted in the agreement with the SEC over the $6 billion trading loss in its London operation that it failed in its oversight. Aid: $4 billion from the deal will be used to help homeowners left struggling after the crash . The admission could leave the bank vulnerable to millions of dollars in lawsuits. JP Morgan also reached settlements over the trading loss with the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority. The Justice Department is still pursuing a criminal investigation of the trading loss and a possible cover-up at the bank. Two of the bank's former traders in London are facing criminal charges. The SEC also is investigating individuals involved in the trading loss. Mounting legal costs from government proceedings pushed JP Morgan to a rare loss in the third quarter, the first under Mr Dimon's leadership. The bank reported on October 11 that it set aside $9.2 billion in the July-September quarter to cover a string of litigation stemming from the financial crisis and its 'London Whale' trading debacle. JP Morgan said it has placed a total of $23 billion in reserve to cover potential legal costs.","Deal would be government's highest-profile action over financial meltdown .

A young Indiana boy kidnapped to Greece by his father who has been reunited with his mother is enjoying their first holiday season in years. Leo Zagaris, 12, was kidnapped in 2011 in Greece by father Nick Zagaris during a divorce-settlement mandated visit, he is now enjoying his first holiday season with his mother since returning. The boy was kept by Nick Zagaris from boarding his return flight home at the end of the visit and wasn’t sure he’d ever make it back to the United States, mother Alissa Zagaris told the Indianapolis Star. Together again: Alissa and Leo Zagaris are finally able to celebrate the holidays together . It was the soon-to-be teenager’s fourth visit to Greece, the previous three ended without incident – but the boy’s father decided to keep him during the last visit. Almost two years later, and after a drawn-out court battle, she was told by the State Department that the Greek Ministry of Justice had ordered Nick Zagaris to return the boy to the US, she told the Star. He's been home for about nine months. ‘I was just on cloud nine,’ she told Fox 59. Leo Zagaris agreed. ‘It feels like home,’ he told the station. Leo took on his first Thanksgiving in three years by starving himself the day before. ‘The day before, he told me he was going to fast all day because he wanted to make sure he had 100 per cent stomach capacity,’ Alissa Zagaris told the Star. ‘I was just so grateful, so happy that he was here,’ she added. ‘There were a couple of times that I teared up when he came in asking ‘Is it almost ready, is it almost ready?’ Abducted by his own father: Nick Zagaris kept the boy from returning to the US after his most recent visit . Back to normal: Leo is happy to be back with his mother and siblings . With Christmas approaching, Leo Zagaris hasn’t let up. ‘It’s kind of going to be like three Christmases,’ he told the Post ‘We’re going to kind of make up for it.’ The youngster has had a little difficulty adjusting to life back home – he was held back a year in school and he misses his friends in Greece. ‘I like being back home with my mom and my little sister but sometimes I feel like I miss Greece,’ he told the Star. ‘I really do miss it because of my dad and my friends there. I love the school there. Life was pretty good there, kind of the same as here.’ Leo keeps in touch with his Greek friends through social media, but his father has cut off all communications since his return. Alissa Zagaris told the Star that her success in getting Leo back home has prompted her to help others in a similar situation.","Leo Zagaris was only nine-years-old when abducted by father Nick Zagaris .

A motion-tracking device that can 'see' through walls without using a camera could change the face of video gaming. Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed the 3D motion tracker which uses radio waves to mark a person's location. The device can plot moves and even follow gestures, meaning that a person can switch a light off in a separate room just by raising their arm. Scroll down for video . Ground breaking: WiTrack can track movements and gestures, such as pointing at a lamp to switch it on, though walls without using cameras or wearable technology . Using radio signals about 1,000 times less powerful than a smartphone, the WiTrack bounces off objects detected through a wall to pinpoint a person with 97 per cent accuracy. WiTrack relies on four antennae to plot movements. One sends radio waves and three receive them. An algorithm is then used to sift through readings caused by waves hitting household objects such as sofas. Fadel Adib, one of the researchers behind it, told Extreme Tech that the transmitted waves were  'structured in a particular way to measure the time from when the signal was transmitted until the reflections come back'. The designers behind WiTrack envision it being used for video games and to control household appliances. Plot: Movements can be tracked though a wall, above, and followed on a computer in a separate room, below . With video game user, players would no longer have to remain in front of the computer, and could stalk enemies in hallways and launch ambushes from behind the sofa. It could also be used to help monitor elderly people who are at risk of falling, without an individual having to wear an alarm or put cameras inside their home. While it will be years before the device is ready for commercial release, it is already making its mark as being cheaper than other devices and also does away with the need of cameras and other wearable technology.","WiTrack uses radio signals to plot movements in breakthrough that could improve video games .

A construction worker has fallen to his death from the roof of the Arena da Amazonia stadium where England will open their 2014 World Cup campaign. Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira, 22, fell 35 metres from the roof of the stadium, located in the city of Manaus, when a cable broke. It is thought he died in hospital at around 4am this morning. Andrade Gutierrez, the construction firm building the stadium, confirmed the man had died on Saturday. Death: The 22-year-old fell around 35 metres from the roof of the stadium, pictured. He died in hospital at 4am this morning . The company said in a statement that Ferreira worked for a firm which had been contracted to build the arena's cover. They added that an internal investigation of the incident would be conducted. The Local Organizing Committee of the World Cup said work on the stadium was halted for a period of mourning, but will resume on Sunday. The construction of the stadium is behind schedule and work is under way 24 hours a day to complete it by Fifa's end of year deadline. The death is the latest tragedy linked to the construction of numerous Brazil World Cup stadiums. Linked: Several construction workers have died while working on stadiums for the Brazil 2014 World Cup - with one dying at the same stadium in May . It will no doubt add to safety concerns as the country races to finish many of the arenas by next year. Last month, two construction workers were killed when a crane collapsed as it was hoisting a 500-ton piece of roofing at the Sao Paulo stadium - where the opening match of the competition will be held. Several more workers were injured. The accident is thought to have put the stadium's completion date back by several months. Another worker fell to his death at the Amazon stadium in May and a worker died in 2012 after falling from a stadium in Brasilia. Preparations for Brazil 2014 have also been plagued by delays, accidents, cost overruns, and public anger over government waste that contributed to massive nationwide street protests in 2012.","Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira, 22, fell 35 metres from the roof of the Arena da Amazonia stadium, Manaus, when a cable broke .

An eight-year-old girl will spend her first Christmas alone after her single mother and younger sister were killed in a horrific car crash on Tuesday morning. Jillian Sedivec, 28, and Savanah Wilson, four, died when their GMC Yukon plowed into the back of a Ralph’s grocery store big rig on the Interstate 5 near Oceanside, California. Traffic investigators said it appeared Sedivec failed to brake as she approached the stationary truck, with her loved ones speculating she may have been tending to her daughter at the time. Tragic: Single mom Jillian Sedivec, 28, and her four-year-old daughter Savanah died when their vehicle slammed into a truck near Oceanside, California on Tuesday . Left alone: Eight-year-old Cydney (front left) has been orphaned after her mother Jillian Sedivec (right) and little sister Savanah (center) were killed on Tuesday . Family and friends were devastated at news of the crash, which has left Sedivec's daughter Cydney an orphan. Sedivec's father Jeff Sedivec, from Idaho, said his daughter was a loving mom whose life revolved around Savanah who was diagnosed with a genetic disease. 'I don’t know if either one of them could have survived without the other,' he told UT San Diego. The family set up a Jillian and Savanah Sedivec Memorial Fund on FundRazr for Sedivec's surviving daughter. 'This fund is for Jillian's surviving  8 year old daughter Cydney and to help with the funeral and memorial expenses,' the online memorial fund says. 'The entire family appreciates everyone's thoughts and prayers as they endure this difficult time.' Nearly $10,000 has been raised in donations for the family. Cydney is being cared for by family members. Loving mother: Friends and family said Jillian Sedivec was devoted to her daughter Savanah (both pictured) who was seriously ill . Police said the grocery store truck was stopped in a . line of other trucks at the San Onofre Commercial Vehicle Enforcement . Facility near the I-5 checkpoint around 9.20am, according to NBC7. Witnesses said Sedivec, from Oceanside, didn't swerve to avoid the collision, however an investigation could take months. The truck driver was not injured and not at fault. Sedivec's best friend Allison Kowalcyk told CBS8 she didn't believe Sedivec was driving irresponsibly before slamming her car into a truck. 'I don't believe in my heart there was any irresponsibility (on Sedivec's part). I believe that she was trying to tend to her daughter,' she said. 'Because she was so devoted to her.' Friends say Savanah suffered from neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder which caused tumors to grow in her legs and stunt her development. Sedivec reportedly worked three jobs to support her family. 'Her daughter [Cydney] is left behind with no mom or sister before Christmas,' a friend told CBS8. Crash scene: Police said the tractor-trailer rig was stopped in the right northbound lane of I-5, preparing to exit at the truck scales, when the crash occurred about 9.20am on Tuesday morning . Fatal: Traffic investigators said it appeared the driver of the SUV did not apply the brakes before the deadly crash . Damaged: Officials said the Yukon was wrecked so badly, investigators initially thought there might be a third victim inside . California Highway Patrol officer Jim Bettencourt told UT San Diego officers will look into Sedivec’s cellphone records to try to determine if she may have been using her phone before the crash. 'What she was doing before the accident, we just don’t know,' he said. However, he ruled out alcohol or drugs as factors, and said Sedivec was wearing a seat belt, and her daughter was belted in a car seat.","Single mother Jillian Sedivec, 28, and her daughter, four-year-old Savanah Wilson, killed in Tuesday morning collision .

I look at myself as just a normal, regular person,’ Ford told CNN. When asked what his children would think of his behavior, Ford said he was the 'best father around.' Speaking at a weekend toy drive in the blue-collar City Council district that his brother Doug represents, Ford said he was 'sick and tired of all the allegations and all this bulls***.' 'Sorry, kids - I shouldn't have sworn in front of the kids,' he said. 'But after a while, I know what I'm doing is right. I'm serving people. I'm saving taxpayers money.

'No one can stop me from returning phone calls, no one can stop me campaigning.' 'We’re going to move forward and I am going to continue to fight for the little guy, I’m going to continue to save taxpayer’s money, and if the councilors want to strip all my power, that’s up to them,' Ford said.

Firefighters have not yet found what caused the tragic house fire in Orrick, Missouri that killed two small boys after their mother left them alone in the house while their father was sleeping. Roger Garrison, 3, and his brother Ashton Garrison, only 21-months, were trapped inside of their burning home just 35 miles Northeast of Kansas City. Randy Garrison awoke to hear his sons screaming at 11:30 am and the boys mother, Tammy Willis, was not home, he told Fox 4. A house in Orrick, Missouri burned to the ground on Tuesday killing two young children and injuring their father . Ashton Garrison was only 21-months when he died on Tuesday in a tragic fire of which the cause is still unknown . Roger Garrison,3, also died in the fire and was coincidentally named after his father's brother who died in a fire years ago . Garrison arrived home from work on Tuesday at 6 a.m. after working a 24-hour shift and went directly to bed. He saw the boys mother asleep with them on the couch. 'I Woke up hearing them screaming at the top of their lungs,' he said. 'Flames in my bedroom and flames in the hallway, flames through the whole house.' When Garrison smelled smoke he tried to burst through his bedroom hall and when he couldn't he ran into the hallway and tripped. Something may have been holding the door to his children's bedroom shut. 'I fell over a bungee cord or something that was holding their bedroom door shut,' he said. 'I ran out the back door around to the front, started ripping the sheeting off the house and trying to punch through that way and I couldn’t.' The Ray County Sheriffs Office asked for help from the patrol's drug and crime unit to investigate the case. They could not say whether or not something had been holding the door shut. Tammy Willis (left) and Randy Garrison(right) were not married but had two children together and lived together for the sake of their children . The home that burned down on Tuesday is entirely decimated and the cause of the fire in still unknown . Tammy's mother Marjorie Long claims that her daughter (right) pictured with her son Ashton, loved her children and would 'starve for them' Garrison was hospitalized for burns and blisters and was never able to make it through the fire to save his boys. Garrison claims he didn't know that the boy's mother was leaving. The couple were not married but lived together for the sake of the children. 'The mother was in the house whenever I went to sleep this morning,' he said. 'And I woke up to her not being here, but my kids were here. You’d think a parent would either wake up another adult in the house or take the kids with her.' Willis' mother Marjorie Long claims that the daughter woke Garrison. Long told Fox 4 that her daughter is in the hospital on heavy medication and deeply mourns the loss of her children. 'She was quite clearly upset,'  Long said to KCTV. 'Several of the . firemen, police were holding her back because she was wanting to run . into the still burning remains of the house to get them,' she continued. Randy Garrison (right) picture with his two children is absolutely devastated that he was unable to save them from the flames . Even though Ashton's (pictured) and Roger's parents have identified their bodies, police are still running DNA to confirm the children's identities . The cause of death remains a mystery and so does the cause of the fire but Garrison thinks arson may have been involved in the death of his two sons . 'She is very loving, very caring. She puts her kids before anything else,' Long said. 'She would starve herself to make sure that the kids had food, to go without things she needed to make sure that they got what they needed,' Long continued. Long told reporters that their daughter is bi-polar. Garrison told reporters that his children were very important to him. 'They were my rock, everything I had in life,' Garrison said. 'The only reason I woke up everyday was for my boys.' 'What would go through your mind after hearing your kids scream bloody murder and basically watching them die in front of you?' he asked KCTV5. Investigators don't know what started the fire but Garrison told reporters, 'I'm still wondering if it's not arson.'

One of the country’s most distinctive Morris dancing troupes is proud of its efforts to preserve an English tradition going back at least a century and a half. Now it fears its days are numbered after council bureaucrats mounted an undercover operation to prove it breaches health and safety rules. Members of the Britannia Coconut Dancers group blacken their faces and dress in skirts for an annual festival in the Lancashire town of Bacup. The Britannia Coco-nutters may never dance at the event in Bacup, Lancashire, which is their biggest turnout every year . The group, known as the 'coconutters' take part every year in the event which lasts around 12 hours . Leaders of the troupe have been presented with a dossier of evidence – including surveillance photographs taken by officials posing as spectators – showing how crowds at this year’s event spilled on to the road. The parade, traditionally held on Easter Saturday, was almost cancelled when Lancashire county council demanded safety measures costing £1,600, only to back down after a public outcry. Now it has emerged that the event was secretly monitored, and the troupe has been told that in future it will have to pay for road closures or participants and spectators will have to stick to the pavement. Yesterday leaders accused the council of trying to stamp out the tradition and said the demands were impractical. The group’s treasurer, Neville Earnshaw, said: ‘If we had to stay on the pavement, we will be dancing into lampposts and bus stops. People will end up with no front teeth. It’s going to be more dangerous.’ Known as the ‘Nutters’, the group has paraded in Bacup every Easter for the past 110 years, although Morris dances have been held there since at least the mid-19th century. Earlier this year, after police said they could no longer afford to patrol the 12-hour event, the council demanded £1,000 for road closures and £600 to train three volunteers to control traffic. It backed down and the event went ahead, attended by 800 people, raising £600 for the local  air ambulance and a hospice. However, when Mr Earnshaw, 66, and group secretary Joe Healey attended a meeting with the council this month to discuss next year’s 111th parade, they were stunned to see the dossier. The Lancashire County Council officials allegedly posed as spectators at the event and then compiled a dossier claiming the dancers and their audience were breaching health and safety regulations . The council has demanded the group restrict their energetic dancing to the pavement during the 12-hour-long festival . The Britannia Coco-nutters have faced problems with Lancashire County Council in the past. They were requested to pay for road closures and train members of the troupe to direct traffic ahead of one year's event . ‘First it was shock that the pictures . had been taken without us knowing,’ Mr Earnshaw, a retired fireman, . said yesterday. ‘Then it was knowledge they were prepared to go down . that road of covert pictures to get the event banned. ‘It’s all this red tape and health . and safety ruling the roost and going over the top at the expense of our . finest English traditions.’ Last night Lancashire county council . ‘strongly disputed’ the dancers’ claim that the parade had been subject . to secret monitoring. It said: ‘We told them in advance our . traffic management people would be there to observe – our guys were . there in high-visibility jackets with the council logo on.’ But Mr Earnshaw said: ‘That’s a lie. We didn’t know anything about it until we were shown the photographs.’ The troupe from Bacup, Lancashire, is over 150 years old with their origins dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries . The event in Bacup is the group's largest and most important performance of the year with over 800 people attending last year . The traditional Coco-nutter routine involves eight dancers and one 'whipper in' who leads proceedings. The dance is believed to have been thought up by Moors who travelled to Cornwall before settling in Lancashire in the 1700-1800s. The theatrical performance includes flower hoops or garlands, extravagant costume and black face-paint, to ward off evil spirits. Though their painted faces have been thought to mimic labourers from the past, the group insists the tradition stems back to a pagan method of disguise. While the majority of Morris dancers wear bell pads on their shins, the Britannia Coco-nutters rely on their wooden clogs and an accompanying concertina for music. The earliest known form of Morris dancing dates back to 1448. The traditionally British dance has become popular abroad too, with more than 150 registered dance troupes in foreign countries. Lancashire County Council claim to have explained their concerns to the dance troupe following a meeting at which local police were also present . The dance troupe is expected to reconvene to discuss the proposals made by council officials .","The Britannia Coco-nut Dancers face being banned from annual parade .

A little known airline has topped a poll of the world’s best carriers, leaving British Airways grounded in sixth place. Aurigny Air Services on Guernsey flies passengers between the Channel Islands, the UK and France and many of the planes are so small that passengers can chat with the pilot and make do without cabin crew. Ryanair was rated the worst short haul airline, according to the Which? survey which asked 8,264 members to list the carriers they had flown with over the past year and say how satisfied they were with them and whether they would recommend them to a friend. Ryanair was rated the worst shorthaul carrier in the Which? survey of 8,264 members asking participants to list all the airlines they had flown with in the last year, rating their satisfaction . Most people (87%) who had flown with Aurigny said they were satisfied with the service and would recommend it to a friend, compared with just under a third (32%) for Ryanair and two thirds for BA (69%), which shared the sixth position for short haul carriers with Air Malta. When the Mail on Sunday broke the news to Aurigny’s spokesman that it had been rated the world’s best airline by customers, she was taken by surprise but delighted. ‘Most people have not heard of us,’ said Mel Rees. ‘That’s great news.’ Millions of Britons know what it is like to start a holiday or business trip flying ‘cattle-class’. But Agnes Perry, 48, who lives on Guernsey with her husband Colin, 58, described what it is like flying with Aurigny. They made it sound like air travel from a bygone era. Mrs Perry, a translator, said: ‘If it’s a short flight, you do not get any food. The planes are so small there’s no central alleyway and there’s enough room for two people to be side by side and one pilot. British Airways shared sixth spot with Air Malta in the survey rating short haul flights . ‘You can see the pilot - there’s no separate cockpit -and you can talk to him and he talks to you. He tells you to sit back and makes sure you have your seatbelt on. There’s no room for cabin crew.’ ‘The pilot has a little joke with you,’ said businessman Mr Perry. ‘He might say “Hello Colin, I haven’t seen you at the club.” ‘It all feels very much like going on a joy trip but it’s very efficient. The pilots are well trained. ‘When you walk out on to the tarmac, there is just one step to get on to the plane - like one you’d use to get into the kichen cupboard. But it’s easier for people in wheelchairs. There’s a human touch. ‘I brought back a large picture from France once and I did not get charged extra for it.’ Which? rated short haul and long haul flight experiences separately and also asked those polled to give each carrier they had used a star rating in terms of flight experience including food offered, in-flight entertainment, boarding experience and comfort. Thomas Cook Airlines came second from bottom for long haul and short haul flights with just over a third of people (37%) liking or willing to recommend the carrier. Thomas Cook Airlines came second from bottom for both long haul and short haul flights with just over a third of people liking or willing to recommend the carrier .

Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines were the most popular long haul carriers, each scoring 87 per cent customer satisfaction overall. Iberia was voted the least popular long haul airline with fewer than a third (28%) saying they were satsified with or would recommend the service. Larger carriers who were beaten in the poll pointed out that just 30 people had given their opinions on Aurigny, compared with hundreds for the other carriers. The airline, founded in 1968 and owned by the Guernsey government, rarely features in polls as comparatively few people have used it. Malcolm Couper, the carrier’s commercial director. said: ‘To sit above some of the most famous names in the airline industry is an achievement for which we are very proud. ‘We try very hard to make the passenger experience as enjoyable and stress-free as possible’. British Airways said in a statement: ‘British Airways was recently named as the top short-haul airline by readers of the Daliy Telegraph and by Conde Nast Traveller.

This is just the latest move by an increasingly aggresive Chinese navy looking to expand their power in the region. According to the Washington Free Beacon, the USS Cowpens was in the South China Sea returning from a disaster relief operation in the Philippines about a week ago when they received a message from the Chinese telling them to halt. Close call: The USS Cowpens was conducting surveillance on the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning last week when it nearly collided with another Chinese ship . Because the ship was in international waters, its commander ignored the message - until the Chinese navy pulled forced the crew's attention. The navy dispatched a tank landing ship to sail right in front of the Cowpens, forcing the warship to pull an emergency change of course. If the U.S. crew hadn't been able to pull off the emergency manevuer, the ship would have definitely collided with the Chinese vessel. 'On December 5th, while lawfully operating in international waters in the South China Sea, USS Cowpens and a PLA Navy vessel had an encounter that required maneuvering to avoid a collision,' a Navy official said. 'This incident underscores the need to ensure the highest standards of professional seamanship, including communications between vessels, to mitigate the risk of an unintended incident or mishap.'

Mercy is not a defense to a murder charge in Ohio. John Wise (pictured) broke down in tears in court today during his sentencing at Summit County Common Pleas Court in Akron, Ohio . The sentence issued by Summit County Court of Common Pleas Judge Mary Margaret Rowlands was in line with a prosecutor's recommendation that Wise receive a lighter punishment than the minimum 23 years on his most serious conviction, an aggravated murder count with a firearm specification. Wise's attorney, Paul Adamson, said ahead of the sentencing that they will pursue clemency from the governor no matter the punishment. County Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh had called Wise's actions illegal and dangerous but said the case warranted leniency. She had recommended that Wise be sentenced on a lesser offense, manslaughter. Neither side had found previous case law to support the prosecutor's suggestion that the judge could sentence Wise to six years for manslaughter, a charge that wasn't among the counts against him but is considered a lesser included offense.

The Denver Broncos are 11-3 so far this season and likely on their way to the AFC playoffs -- and when you fully understand who the team's quarterback is, it very becomes apparent as to why. Peyton Manning is widely considered one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL - if not NFL history. And he's often described by teammates as one of the most dedicated. For example, he apparently studies game film while wearing his helmet - in a hot tub. The photo of Manning wearing his helmet in the hot tub went viral earlier this week, and left some people scratching their heads. Dedication: Manning isn't crazy, he's listening to play calls in his helmet while studying game film . But Manning's not crazy, he's just dedicated. 'Earlier this season, Manning and tight end Julius Thomas found . themselves in the training room instead of practice on a Wednesday,' the Broncos' website explains. 'Not wanting to miss out on mental reps, Manning took matters into his own hands.' The site continues to explain that, 'with . his injured ankle in the cold tub, the quarterback kept his helmet on . to listen to the play calls from Offensive Coordinator Adam Gase, who . was on the practice field.

Despite receiving the death sentence Friday for his part in the grisly slaying of 15-year-old Seath Jackson, his killer maintains his innocence. Michael Bargo, 21, became the youngest person on death row in Florida when Judge David Eddy sentenced him, saying it was the 'most cold, calculated and premeditated case of murder I have ever seen.' Bargo told Fox 35 that far from murdering Jackson, he hardly knew him. Maintains innocence: He's been sentenced to death for killing Seath Jackson, 15, but Michael Bargo, 21, still says he didn't do it . 'First of all I didn't kill him and second of all I met this dude like twice in my life,' he said. People think the truth is that you are a murderer, and that you murdered a 15-year-old and you shot him in the face at point blank because you wanted to see him die,' a Fox Orlando reporter put to Bargo. 'Yeah, they've been telling me that for two years now.' 'So who are you instead,' the reporter asked. 'A person who didn't do that,' Bargo responded. Fired the fatal shot: Bargo denies he was the person who shot Seath Jackson in the face, killing him . He said he could remember his grandmother crying in the courtroom as he was sentenced, and that he's sorry for the victim's family. 'I still don't know what I feel,' he said of the sentence that will see him languish on death row. He told Fox 35 that he was unhappy with his legal team, and that the case against him was false. 'So many lies it was beyond ridiculous,' he said of the evidence against him. 'Nobody wanted to hear, and nobody wanted to sit there and tell the truth.' He will be transferred from the Marion County Jail to Death Row within the week. Bargo's sentence with be reviewed, as is automatic with any death sentence.

Too little, too late: Bargo's father, described during the trial as an abusive alcoholic, called out to him, saying 'I love you, son,' before he was led away . He was the last of five defendants to be sentenced in the April 2011 murder of Seath Jackson, 15, near Ocala. The other defendants - Amber Wright, . 17; Kyle Hooper, 19; Charlie Kay Ely, 21; and Justin Soto, 22 - were all . sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors . say Jackson was lured to the home by his ex-girlfriend, Amber Wright, . where he was beaten, shot and tortured before his body was burned in a . backyard fire pit. Dubious honor: At age 21, Bargo is the youngest of Florida's 404 death row inmates . The . teen's remains were then placed into three paint buckets and dumped into . a limerock pit. Testimony showed bad blood existed between Jackson and . Bargo, who started dating Wright after her split from the 15-year-old. Bargo was believed to be the triggerman and mastermind behind the plot to kill Jackson. On the stand, however, Bargo fingered Hooper as the gunman. In a recent jailhouse interview with the Star-Banner, Bargo said, ‘I'm not crazy, I'm not a psycho, I'm not a bad person.’ During the trial, Hooper described how Bargo ordered him to place Jackson in the bathtub alive so he would know who killed him. Bargo . told jurors during his trial in August that he wasn't at the home when . Jackson was killed and was only an accessory after the fact. The jury . recommended the death sentence by a 10-2 vote. During . the penalty phase of the trial the defense presented evidence of a . messy separation between his parents that left Bargo angry and bitter. They also suggested that Bargo suffers from seizures in his brain where he becomes unable to control his emotions. Convicted killer: Michael Bargo, pictured in August, was convicted in . less than three hours for his part in the 2011 murder of Seath Jackson. A jury late yesterday decided he deserved the death sentence . The . state countered with an expert that disagrees with some of the . defense's assessment. They said Bargo was in control of his emotions the . night Jackson was killed. During . his sentencing, the 21-year-old sat at the defense table staring . blankly at the judge. Upon learning his fate, Bargo merely blinked, but . showed no emotion. Jackson's family wasn't in the courtroom Friday. Bargo's relatives sobbed in the courtroom upon learning the sentence.

A Louisiana sinkhole that has sucked in trees and swamps as it spread to the size of 20 football fields is now at risk of exploding. Residents of Bayou Corne were evacuated a year ago when the sinkhole, which is emitting natural gases, opened up. The gas exploration company that has been blamed for causing the problem after a mine collapsed, has resorted to digging relief wells to try to disperse the gas. Expanding: The Bayou Corne sinkhole covers 24 acres and has been sucking in trees and swamp . Explosive: Natural gas building up in the sinkhole could cause it to ignite like this one in Turkmenistan . Evacuated: Bayou Corne was once home to 350 residents but only a few have remained . Louisiana state is suing Texas Brine as it tries to recoup $8 million used to deal with the sinkhole, including bringing in a team of scientists, according to The Verge. While no homes have yet been sucked in, officials warn that the gases being emitted could ignite, which would leave the Louisiana swamp looking like 'the gates of Hell'. In a similar case, a crater caused by Soviet geologists drilling in Turkmenistan in the 1970s has been a fiery pit for more than 40 years after the natural gases being released were lit. The Louisiana sinkhole, which is expected to expand to 50 acres, is currently 25 acres wide and 350ft deep in some points. Methane bubbling up from it has also escaped into an aquifer. Experts fear that if oil and gas rising to the surface became trapped it could build up in a crevice and then explode. What lies beneath: Oil and natural gas surface at the sinkhole which opened up last year . Fire pit: If the natural gas ignited the sinkhole could become like the Door to Hell in Turkmenistan, which has been alight for 40 years . Risk: A sign warns of the potential risk caused by the build up of gas . John Boudreaux, who is part of the parish's emergency preparedness team, said about 6 million cubic feet of natural gas was trapped beneath the surface. He said only 5 per cent needed to get in the air for it to ignite. Scientists are constantly monitoring the affected region and several weeks ago noticed a rise in micro-earthquake activity, from an average of 10 to 15 a day to 326 in one 24-hour period. The sinkhole appeared overnight in August last year, when the wall of a salt mine 5,000ft underground collapsed, sucking in surrounding water and releasing gas. Because it allegedly knew the risks involved with deep drilling, Texas Brine's insurance has refused to pay out, according to Al Jazeera. The natural gas company has bought up about 60 properties which it plans to demolish to make way for outlets so the build up of gas can release. Anger: Residents who have lost their homes and community protest over the sinkhole, caused when a mined salt cavern collapsed . Protest: Lawn ornaments outside a Bayou Corne house are used to hit back at Texas Brine, the company blamed for the problem . Repairing the damage: Texas Brine is drilling release wells to try to safely disperse the natural gas . A mandatory evacuation was issued to the parish's 300 residents, but many are still paying their mortgages and utility bills, and some have even refused to leave their homes. Mike Schaff stayed on after the evacuation but said he is now ready to leave. 'We were planning on retiring here. Now, instead of coming up and enjoying the weekend, sitting on the patio drinking a few glasses of wine, we wake up in the morning and we go look for houses. That’s the new reality,' he said. Texas Brine has issued regular updates on its efforts to tackle the problem. In the latest statement, released on November 14, it said: 'Over the past 15 months, Texas Brine Company has been committed to responding to this incident and mitigating any impact to the environment, while supporting a community in need and continuing efforts to understand potential risks involved with the sinkhole.' Expanding: No homes have been sucked in yet but trees are pulled under as the hole expands .

More than 5,000 people could be being held captive as slaves across Britain, it has emerged. Andrew Wallis, CEO of Unseen, a charity which supports victims of slavery and human trafficking, says three women discovered living in a house in Lambeth, south London, are among thousands of victims likely to be enslaved in the UK. He estimated there could be as many as 5,000 people being kept in homes against their will. Enslaved: Three women were rescued from a house in the London Borough of Lambeth after being held captive for more than 30 years. Charity Unseen says number of people held captive in UK could be more than 5,000 . Mr Wallis told The Sun most . human trafficking was to force people into the sex industry but victims . are also forced to work either on domestic chores or by committing . crimes. He added: 'One of the women rescued this week was Irish, one Malaysian and another was born into slavery here. She has known nothing else for 30 years. 'People might ask why they don't just leave. But these people are abused and live in fear. They trust no one.' A worrying trend is the amount of people brought to the UK for organ harvesting. He added: 'A seven-year-old Somali girl was brought into the UK with the sole purpose of having her organs harvested.' The three women rescued from a life of slavery in London this week had been held for at least 30 years. A 30-year-old British woman, a 57-year-old Irish woman and a 69-year-old Malaysian woman were found after the Irish woman called a charity in a 'very distressed state'. It has been claimed the couple suspected of keeping them captive used cult-like techniques to brainwash their victims. Sources said the women were occasionally allowed out on their own to run errands but it is believed the trio are suffering from Stockholm syndrome, a psychological state in which hostages express empathy towards their kidnappers. Police would not say whether other public bodies, such as social services, education authorities or hospitals, had had contact with the victims while they were captives. Officers also refused to disclose whether any of the victims are related to each other or to the suspects, and whether the youngest victim – who is said to have spent her entire life in servitude – had been to school or her birth registered. Police do not believe the case is one of sexual exploitation or human trafficking. Slavery: The Lambeth case is just the 'tip of the iceberg' according to CEO Andrew Wallis who says traffickers treat people as a commodity. Metropolitan Police say of the women in Lambeth phoned the Freedom charity . The details emerged as detectives revealed the two suspects arrested over the case were known to police and had been detained in the 1970s. They also said the pair, both foreign, are being investigated over unspecified immigration offences as well as allegations relating to slavery. The arrested pair were released on bail on conditions that include a stipulation they are not permitted to return to their home in the borough of Lambeth where the victims were rescued from last month. A police search of the address, believed to be in Brixton, took 12 hours. Officers seized 55 bags of evidence containing more than 2,500 exhibits. Mr Wallis added: 'As this case clearly shows, slavery is a hidden crime. It’s a crime that is happening behind closed doors in the UK, but it is clearly happening. Detective Inspector Kevin Hyland speaks to the press outside New Scotland Yard after three women were rescued from a Lambeth house. Andrew Wallis from Unseen says slavery is hidden behind closed doors . 'The shackles are psychological what was holding them was fear and coercion and possible threats or actual violence against them.' Mr Wallis, whose charity provides care to victims of human trafficking through its secure accommodation and resettlement project, said they are continually trying to raise awareness of slavery in the UK. 'We welcome the Home Secretary's determination to bring about the Modern Slavery Act as this is a step in the right direction, but as this news shows we need to do more.' Co-founder of Unseen Kate Garbers said: 'In our experience survivors of human trafficking who have been through such trauma need long term care. October 18 - The Irish victim, 57, contacts Freedom Charity after seeing its founder on TV. She was 'distraught' on the phone and said she had been held captive for 30 years with two others. She was also said to mention her 'friend' who was being refused medical help after suffering a suspected stroke.October 25 - She and the youngest victim, 30, meet the charity and police at a secret location before heading back to rescue the Malaysian woman, 69. They are taken to a 'place of safety.November 21 - Foreign couple, both 67, are arrested on suspicion of immigration offences as well as slavery offences. They are bailed until January. 'It is not just the immediate support, but the on-going help that is essential to starting the road to recovery. These women have been through so much and there is no quick fix. 'This is a long and traumatic process, but there is hope at the end.' Frank Field, chairman of the Modern Slavery Bill evidence review, said criminal gangs were making 'huge sums of money'. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Field said many victims who escape have no way of communicating because they speak little or no English and often come from countries where they are 'deeply suspicious' of the police. Cases of slavery around Britain have hit headlines in the past as the Serious Organised Crime Agency estimate there to be 2,255 potential victims last year in the UK. An Irish traveller father and his son who forced destitute men to be their slaves were jailed for 13 years in May this year. Tommy Connors Senior, 53, was jailed for eight years and his son Patrick, 21, for five years at Luton Crown Court. The pair, from the Greenacres site in Little Billington, Leighton Buzzard, had been convicted last July of servitude, compulsory labour and assault charges after a trial at the court. They preyed on vulnerable, homeless people who had drink or drug dependencies. Sisters Bo, 46 and Yan Li, 43, were jailed in 2009 for laundering cash, linked to a human trafficking operation which claimed the lives of 23 cockle pickers at Morecambe Bay in Lancashire in 2004. The Morecambe Bay disaster in 2004 saw 23 Chinese immigrants working for criminal gangmasters drown while cockle picking after they were trapped by the rising tide. The deaths of the men and women - aged between 18 and 45 - exposed the illegal practices of gangmasters who exploit vulnerable migrant workers for cheap labour. All of the victims had been illegal immigrants, some of whom had only been in the UK for a few months before the tragedy. The man who sent them out on to the sands in February 2004 - gangmaster Lin Liang Ren - was later given a 14-year prison sentence for manslaughter.","Andrew Wallis, CEO of charity Unseen, says case is one of thousands .

Proving that age really is just a number - and that it is never too late to adopt a healthy lifestyle - a new generation of  grannies are pushing their bodies to the limit by undertaking the ultimate endurance runs. Shunning more traditional OAP hobbies like knitting and baking, these tenacious older women are putting the youth to shame by competing in extreme ultra-marathons - known to be some of the hardest tests of physical and mental endurance in the world. One such grandmother, 77-year-old Andjelina Andjelic - also known as Serbia's Supergran - regularly runs ultra-marathons of 100 km each. 'I hope I will still be running at the age of 100!' says Andjelina Andjelic who, at 77-years-old runs ultra-marathons of 100 km each . The Belgrade-bomber, as she is known to her friends, only took up running at the age of 55 when she thought that it was time that she 'started to live a little bit more healthily.' Since making that decision she has pounded her way through 100 pairs of trainers and competed in such celebrated urban races as the New York, Rome and London marathons. 'I first started to run 100 metres to see if I even could do that. Then I went for 200, 500 and after a while I participated at race of 5,000 metres', she said. 'Sometimes I have to ask the organisers not to pack up and go home before I cross the finish line. 'I am a bit slower than many, but I always make a point of completing a race. 'The most gruelling I recall was 111 kilometres, but it took me 24 hours', said Andjelina, adding that she runs for health and fun, not for results - although it remains a fact that she has won 35 different medals. 'Some even don't believe it when I say I am a granny"", she said. 'I think they expect me to sit at home and knit, or something. Mimi, 51, from Kent, only took up running at 36 but has still managed to break records in the sport, and this weekend will face another grueling challenge as she competes in the 250 km Desert Ultra marathon . The grandmother has previously ran the Badwater ultra marathon in Death Valley twice in a row . 'But there is nothing like the wind in your face and the adrenalin pumping through your body to make you feel good. I hope I will still be running at the age of 100!' Another Supergran who is racing into the the record books is Mimi Anderson, 51, from Kent. The grandmother to Theo, aged five, and Finley, two, only took up running at 36 but has still managed to break records in the sport. Having suffered an eating disorder in her youth for 15 years she says it was taking up running at the age of 36 that gave her the incentive to battle the condition. She has won numerous world records for her endurance feats including the fastest crossing on foot across Ireland (345 miles in three days, 15 hours and nearly 37 minutes) and the furthest distance covered on a treadmill by a female over seven days. This weekend Mimi will compete in the Desert Ultra, a 250km super marathon set in the dry heat of the Namib Desert. The race is self-sufficient meaning Mimi will be carrying all of her kit and equipment for the entire race, which includes a sleeping bag, food, safety equipment and a minimum of 2.5 litres, while running in extreme heat. Despite the monumental task ahead of her, Mimi says on her blog that she is excited about the challenge. 'I canâ€™t tell you how excited I am to have the opportunity to run once again in such a stunning location, with the added bonus of all the wild life we will see; so close sometimes you could almost touch them. 'My pink camera is charging and ready to go!  One of the reasons I began running in the first place was to see amazing Countries like Africa,' she says.","Andjelina Andjelic, 77, took up running aged 55 in a bid to be 'healthier'

A Mexican diplomat and his wife didn’t call 911 before getting a cab to New York City hospital with 5-month old baby son who later died in ‘suspicious’ circumstances, it emerged today. Eduardo Rocha Bracamontes, 36, and his wife Gina Ximena Ovalle, 26, left their a upmarket building in Midtown, Manhattan, to hail a taxi to a nearby hospital instead of calling emergency services and waiting for an ambulance to arrive. ‘That’s how it works in a third world country,’ Roger Asmar, the attorney retained by the couple, told MailOnline today. ‘The baby would die in your hands if you call 911 and wait for authorities to come'. ‘In an emergency you take your child straight to the hospital.’ Diplomat: Eduardo Rocha Bracamontes works at the Mexican Consulate in Manthattan. He and his wife took a cab to the hospital rather than dialling 911 . The parents handed over the couple’s infant son Eduardo Rocha Ovalle to hospital staff at around 9pm on Tuesday. Staff at the hospital contacted police. The whereabouts of the father and mother is unknown, but Mr Bracamontes hasn’t returned to work as he in a grieving state. But they were unable to resuscitate the boy, who had bruises and cuts on his body, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterward. The couple had left their fourth floor apartment on E. 32nd Street apartment to bring him to NYU Langone Medical Center - six minutes away in clear traffic - where he was pronounced dead, police said. ‘They brought him to the hospital and hospital staff called 911,’ a police source confirmed. Although a preliminary autopsy proved inconclusive NYPD Police Chief Raymond Kelly said today that the investigation remains ‘open’ pending further testing. ‘We're waiting for a toxicology report that will take up to two weeks,’ he said. ‘The Mexican ambassador was informed that there were no charges against the individual(s) at this time. ‘The investigation is still open.’ Despite not calling 911 the couple’s lawyer said his client’s are already in the clear. ‘They did the right thing – they rushed their son to the hospital and I believe it’s clear both my clients have nothing to do with his death.’ The lawyer didn’t confirm whether or not the child suffered from epilepsy, as has been reported. ‘I do know he was suffering from a condition,’ Asmar said. ‘But I’m not clear what the condition is as I’ve never seen the medical documents regarding that.’ The couple claim the bruises and cuts across his body were were self-inflicted. The New York Daily News reported that the baby boy had a laceration to his scalp and cuts on his right thumb and a toe. Home: Police have been called to the family's home in this Manhattan building twice for domestic spats . The parents are cooperating with police, their lawyer said. ‘[Eduardo] has been very cooperative with the investigation by providing any information that’s needed.’ A downstairs neighbor, who requested anonymity, was home on that fateful Tuesday night. ‘I was downstairs that night and I didn’t hear nothing no crying no yelling, nothing. And the walls are so thin here that you hear everything.’ Not long afterward the tenant saw the mother ‘sitting downstairs waiting for cops.’ The tenant said the couple moved into the building 10 months ago and recalled the cops paying two visits to the apartment. ‘[Gina] called the cops and was crying saying he shook her.’ Cops confirmed that they were called to the home that the couple lived in twice for ‘verbal disputes’ in September and October, however there’s no record of any arrests. But the neighbor said as parents they doted on their son. ‘I would see them go out together with the stroller just like a happy family,’ the tenant said. ‘And she would show pictures of the baby saying, “Look at him in this outfit or in that.”’ According to Carlos Gerardo, press attaché at the Mexican consulate, Eduardo Rocha Bracamontes ‘is a consular official who has consular immunity.’ Gerardo said the diplomat shares the same [diplomatic] immunities as all consular officers. Today, a funeral home claimed the boy’s body, a spokeswoman fro the medical Examiner’s Office confirmed.","Baby Eduardo Rocha Ovalle was pronounced dead at a Manhattan hospital on Tuesday night after he was rushed there by his parents .

Everyone has been seduced by a squishy new sofa or designer desk in a roomy show room, only to find that they don't fit in their considerably smaller living room. But a new app from Ikea could save consumers from hacking lumps out of bookcases or sheepishly taking back extra large items to the Swedish superstore as it uses augmented reality technology to show consumers what a piece of furniture would look like in their home. The '2014 Ikea catalogue app,' which launches on 25 August, lets customers furnish their home digitally with the help of a traditional paper catalogue. The '2014 Ikea catalogue app,' (pictured) which launches on 25 August, lets customers furnish their home digitally with the help of a traditional paper catalogue . Ikea said the technology lets customers virtually place 90 of its products in their rooms 'to enable them to find the perfect fit' as well as test colours and positioning. The free app will be available in the Apple App Store and Google Play and uses the old-fashioned paper Ikea catalogue to judge the approximate scale of the furnishings. It works by measuring the size of the catalogue itself (laid on the . floor in the place where the new item of furniture might go) in the camera.

Research by the home furnishings retailer found many of its customers suffer from 'square peg, round hole syndrome' as 14 per cent say they have bought the wrong-sized furniture for their rooms. Over 70 per cent of shoppers admitted that they do not know how big their homes are, which inspired Ikea to develop the app. Ikea said: 'Customers will be able to see what different Ikea sofas, chairs, beds, bookcases, chests of drawers and desks look like in their rooms virtually, simply by using their mobile phone camera' The shop also said making the most of space in the UK is particularly important as Britons live in the smallest houses in Western Europe, with the average house having approximately just 85 square metres of floor space. Peter Wright, marketing manager of Ikea in the UK and Ireland, said: 'When our designers and interiors experts started to think about how we could use augmented reality to help our customers, we felt that we could solve some of the very real problems they face. 'Our customers want to be able to test out whether the products theyâ€™ve been inspired by in our catalogue will work in their own homes â€“ particularly when it comes to larger pieces of furniture.

A casino owner-turned-commercial developer is asking $7.85million to sell a Las Vegas home - and he's willing to accept the controversial online currency Bitcoin as payment. Jack Sommer said he got the idea to seek Bitcoin for his 25,000-square-foot mansion from two of his sons, who've been involved in making and trading the currency. ‘The advantage is that we're expanding our market and adding some notoriety,’ Sommer said. New money: Jack Sommer, right, and his real estate agent Craig Tann stand in the library of Sommers' home in the Spanish Trail neighborhood of Las Vegas, which he is hoping to sell for $7.85million in Bitcoins . Fit for a king: From left, Tann, Laura and Jack Sommer stand in front of the Sommers' palatial home trimmed in marble and cherry wood . Bitcoin peer-to-peer trading began in 2009. Value is purchased through an exchange website with a mainstream paper currency, such as dollars or euros, though trading isn't government-regulated. Using the currency can streamline international business deals, said Julian Tosh, a consultant and owner of the marketplace website Bitcoinsinvegas.com. ‘There are a bunch of people who have Bitcoins, and they're dying for a place to spend it,’ Tosh told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He said Sommer's willingness to accept Bitcoin could open the home to a global audience. ‘If you increase awareness of potential buyers, you could tap into new markets,’ Tosh said. Sommer has put a lot of work into the home in the posh Spanish Trail Country Club. It features marble from China, Iceland and Brazil, a full basement, staff quarters with Jacuzzis, and a secret garden. It also has 39 air-conditioning zones fed from a 120-ton cooling tower. Refined luxury: Sommer said he and his wife are downsizing now that their seven children have grown and moved out . The extravagant mansion comes with a guest house, complete with a four-poster bed . Pristine condition: An upstairs hallway leading to the children's rooms in Jack and Laura Sommer's Spanish Trail neighborhood home . Library shelves are stainless steel clad in American cherry wood, and the view from the owner's suite is of golf course fairways. Sommer once owned the Aladdin resort, which is now the Planet Hollywood Resort on the Las Vegas Strip. He said he and his wife, Laura, considered the additions they've made to the home ‘an exercise in how many cool details we could put in.’ He said they were downsizing now that their seven children have grown and moved out. Sommer's sales agent, Craig Tann, of Prudential American Group's Estates of Las Vegas team, said the home may be the first in southern Nevada to be marketed formally around Bitcoin. A range of businesses accept the currency. A California Lamborghini dealership sold a $103,000 Tesla to a Florida man for 91.4 Bitcoin, the Review-Journal reported, and a Canadian man listed his Alberta home for the Bitcoin equivalent of $405,000. How it works: Bitcoin peer-to-peer trading began in 2009, and value is purchased through an exchange website with a mainstream paper currency . The currency hit a watermark when Bank of America Merrill Lynch said this month that one Bitcoin could have a maximum value of $1,300, or more than the price of an ounce of gold. A Bitcoin on Friday was valued at about $870, up from $10 in January. Tosh acknowledged the volatility in value could make a $7.85 million Bitcoin trade risky. ‘Locking in a price for such a large transaction is going to be kind of difficult,’ he said. ‘If the value is changing 30 per cent a day, how do you quantify that in a contract and expect each side to hold on for 30 to 90 days while escrow clears?’","Jack Sommer, one-time owner of Aladdin resort, is looking to sell his 25,000-square-foot home in Spanish Trail  Country Club .

It seems like the Holiday season starts earlier every year, with Christmas lights on store shelves in October, and carols on the radio before Thanksgiving. But for Bronx chef Jon Lovtich, the season started even earlier than most, last February. That's when he started constructing Gingerbread Lane, the entirely edible gingerbread village recently deemed the world's largest by Guinness World Records. (The world's largest gingerbread house went to a construction in Texas that didn't qualify for the edible prize since the frame was made of wood.) The 1.5 ton cookie construction currently spans 300-square-feet at the New York Hall of Science in Queens. For perspective, that's as heavy as a large hippopotamus and the size as a two-car garage. Scroll down for video . Cookie city: Gingerbread Lane at the New York Hall of Science is the largest edible gingerbread village in the world, spanning 300-square feet and weighing 1.5 tons . All coming together: The gingerbread monolith was created entirely by chef Jon Lovitch, who has been baking and constructing the pieces individually in his Bronx apartment since last February . For the past year, 37-year-old Lovitch has been baking and building the village's houses, ice rink, firehouse, and railroad stations at his apartment in the Bronx near Yankee Stadium. He says he's spent a 'few grand' on the project, buying 400 pounds of candy, ingredients for 500 pounds of gingerbread dough and 2,240 pounds of icing. Unsurprisingly the cookie construction packs quite the calorie count. The dough is the the most dangerous with over 958,000 calories, the decorators icing amounts to around 423,000 and if all 400 pounds of candy were from candy canes, that would mean nearly 699,000 calories. Mr Lovtich says he saves money by buying ingredients anytime he's out of the city, cleaning out rural supermarkets of flour, candy and sugar. Making the gingerbread village came second to his job as the executive chef at the New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge, and most of the baking and construction took place after midnight while his wife was asleep. Ongoing project: Mr Lovitch started assembling the village as a whole this fall when he began driving the 164 structures from his apartment to the space in Queens. He continues to add to it even midway through December . 'My wife likes the fact that I work on it at home and I'm not out gambling or drinking,' he told the New York Times. It wasn't until this fall that Mr Lovitch started driving the 164 structures stored in his apartment's empty bedroom to the Hall of Science for assembly in the days leading up to the November 17 opening. And he continues to add to the structure even midway into December. The artist's mother, Vickie Lovitch, calls her son a 'gingerbread Santa Claus' and told the Times that his obsession with Christmas started at a young age when he would string 10,000 Christmas lights outside their house. Admirers: Lisa Grillo accompanies Emily, 8, and Kate, 9, as they look at the Gingerbread Lane, on December 12 . His focus on gingerbread as a medium came when he was a teenager, and he lost a competition in his hometown of Kansas City, Missouri. Since then, he's been trying to make up for that initial loss, making bigger and better constructions each year as he moved around the country, from Washington, DC to Pittsburgh. Last January he moved to New York City with the express purpose of getting more attention for his gingerbread making, and hopefully turning the hobby into a full-time career making and teaching gingerbread architecture. Not for the calorie counter: Mr Lovitch says he spent a 'few grand' on the project which is made of 400 pounds of candy, 500 pounds of gingerbread dough and 2,240 of icing . 'Being a chef, people may remember my meals for a day or two, but with the gingerbread, I can get thousands of people at a time to checkout out my work,' he said. 'I've gotten emails a year later, thanking me for it.' Gingerbread Lane can be viewed at the Hall of Sciences in Queens until January 12 - the day it will be disassembled and visitors can take pieces of the village home with them to eat. Those pieces baked in early February might be a little stale though. Mr Lovtich also has another gingerbread village in the city this winter, at the Marriott. It's three stories high with 75 structures and he's been baking it out of the hotel's kitchen. Tasty: Gingerbread Lane will be on view until January 12 when it will be dissembled and visitors can take pieces of the houses home with them to snack on .","Gingerbread Lane was deemed the world's largest edible gingerbread village by Guinness World Records .

A European Commissioner today launched a devastating attack on David Cameron’s plans to curb benefits for migrants, accusing the Prime Minister of not telling the truth and fuelling ‘hysteria’. Hungarian Laszlo Andor claimed action to deter foreign benefits claimants risked presenting the UK as a ‘nasty country’ and could be the start of the ‘slippery slope’ towards the collapse of the single market. The European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion boasted that massive immigration from Poland had 'did not cause damage' to Britain but actually helped the economy to grow. Attack: Laszlo Andor, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, accused David Cameron of not telling the truth about immigration . The extraordinary remarks by a senior Brussels official directly attacking the British Prime Minister is likely to fuel growing public anger at the rules imposed by the EU on border controls. So we would need a more accurate presentation of the reality not under pressure, not under such hysteria which sometimes happens in this case. Mr Cameron today insisted he understood the public’s concerns, and unveiled a package of measures to restrict access to benefits for EU migrants. Ahead of the lifting of controls on newcomers from Romania and Bulgaria on January 1, he will declare that the founding EU principle of ‘free movement’ for workers has gone too far. EU jobseekers will no longer be paid housing benefit to subsidise accommodation costs, there will be time limits before out-of-work benefits can be claimed and migrants who currently get jobseekers’ allowance after less than a month will have to wait three months before claiming. When Laszlo Andor was handed the plum job as European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion in 2009, even parties in his native Hungary said he was ill-suited to the role. The economist himself admitted: 'Everyone says I'm an unusual choice.' Fluent in English and Russian, he studied at the Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences and was an active member of the economic section of the Hungarian Socialist party from 1998 to 2005. In 2009 he was forced to deny being a member of the Communist Party. He earns £212,000-a-year, and has been described as 'probably the most left-wing of the EU's 28 commissioners'. He once launched a defence of the Soviet Bloc in The Guardian. In an attempt to play down tensions with the UK last month, his spokesman insisted he once lived in London and Manchester, and likes Kent-brewed ale. Benefits will be stopped after six months, beggars and vagrants from EU countries will be removed and barred from re-entering Britain for 12 months and a new ‘minimum earnings threshold’ will be set below which benefits that top up earnings, such as income support, will be cut altogether. But Mr Andor tore into Mr Cameron’s plans, accusing the Prime Minister of not giving the British public the truth about immigration. ‘This is an unfortunate over-reaction. We have been in dialogue with the British authorities, government offices, in recent years. ‘We always encourage a fact-based debate about the current movements of workers and the implications,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘So we would need a more accurate presentation of the reality not under pressure, not under such hysteria which sometimes happens in this case.’ He went on: ‘Unilateral action… is not really helpful because it risks presenting as a kind of nasty country in the European Union. ‘We don’t want that. I think there are much better ways and we have to look into the situation collectively and if there are real problems we act proportionally and not in such a way.’ Mr Andor insisted the issue was not ‘immigration’ but ‘the free movement of workers which applies to every EU member state’. He said the current rules had been drawn up by all EU member states, including the UK. In a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Cameron’s pledge to return the orginal purpose of the EU as a trading bloc, Mr Landor added: ‘It is part of the single market which the UK appreciates so much in the European Union.’ He went on: ‘If we start to dismantle some of the rules of the single market which should apply to everyone of course others may invent other idea… and then we end up on the slippery slope. And that is something that nobody really wants. ‘The point is that the British has not been given all the truth and the full truth about this subject.’ David Cameron unveiled sweeping new restrictions on access to benefits for EU migrants . He complained that an article by Mr Cameron today drew a link between EU enlargement and the number of migrants. ‘Well we know that about two thirds of the migrants who go to the United Kingdom from non-European countries. ‘And also if you look at the current movement, much more people moving from for example Italy and Spain than from Romania and Bulgaria.’ He added that there are existing EU rules and safeguards against ‘so-called benefit tourism’. ‘For . example jobseekers allowance: if someone newly arrives to the UK or . another country it is the home country which in the first place needs to . cover if necessary jobseekers and not the receiving country.’ But Downing Street rejected the accusations from the £212,000-a-year Eurocrat. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'As the Prime Minister was saying in his article, we are not the only country to see free movement as a qualified right. I think it is very important to be clear about the measures that the Government is taking.' The spokesman told a daily Westminster media briefing that the PM was ""of course"" confident of the legal basis for his proposals. Pressed over whether he would go ahead with their implementation regardless of the response from Brussels, the spokesman said: 'This is what we are going to do.' There has been growing anxiety about the impact of restrictions on Romanians and Bulagrians being lifted in January. The UK government is under pressure to curb entry to the UK when EU restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians coming here to work are lifted in January . There are fears of a repeat of 2004 when Labour opened up the borders to eight Eastern European countries – including Poland. Then, officials predicted just 13,000 migrants a year would come but more than a million have arrived. Mr Andor said: ‘It is true that migration from countries like Poland in the last decade was higher.’ Pressed . by Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys that the figures was ‘massively . higher’, Mr Andor added: ‘It was massively higher but it did not cause . damage. It actually contributed to the growth of the British economy. Commissioner Laszlo Andor . ‘I think if there are real problems we have to look at those, analyse those together, and if there is any kind of problem we have to reflect together.’ However, Mr Cameron accuses Labour of a ‘monumental mistake’ in failing to control immigration from Eastern Europe. He said the last government's refusal to impose controls on new EU members in 2004 . led to a surge in immigration. One million people from central and . Eastern Europe now live in the UK. ‘In . 2004, the Labour Government made the decision that the UK should opt . out completely of transitional controls on the new EU member states. 'They had the right to impose a seven-year ban before new citizens could . come and work here, but – almost alone in Europe – Labour refused it. That was a monumental mistake,’ Mr Cameron writes in an article for the . Financial Times today. He said ‘That was the moment to address difficult questions about when . to allow new entrants full access to each others’ labour markets – but . the Labour Government ducked these questions.’ But Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mr Cameron of 'playing catch up'. She aded: 'Why has it taken him eight months to copy Labour's proposal to make the Habitual Residence Test stronger and clearer? 'After Labour proposed this change in March, the Government said it was all fine and nothing needed to change. Yet now, rather than following a coherent plan, they are flailing around. No wonder public confidence in the Government's handling of this issue has collapsed. 'This change was only one of Labour's proposals. The Government should also be beefing up enforcement of dodgy gangmasters and targeting sectors that are reliant on migrant labour to ensure they are working to train employees.' UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: 'UKIP has driven the agenda in terms of warning of the dangers of opening up our doors to EU nations like Bulgaria and Romania next year and now we see Cameron and Clegg trying to recover from the UKIP surge. 'These measures fall way short of what the British public want though. Our borders will remain open. Migrants will still be entitled to out of work benefits after just three months. It isn’t nearly good enough.'","Laszlo Andor accuses David Cameron of an 'unfortunate over-reaction'

When the traffic grinds to a halt and the cries of ‘Are we there yet?’ begin, it is a surefire solution for frustrated parents. But gadgets such as the iPad have now overtaken the traditional guessing game as a way to keep youngsters amused for hours on the road. Gadgets such as the iPad have overtaken I Spy was a way to keep children entertained in car journeys . While nearly a third (30 per cent) of drivers said their parents played I Spy to keep them happy on long trips, only one in seven (14 per cent ) of current parents said they used the game to keep their own youngsters content, an AA/Populus survey reveals. Parents now most often rely on electronic games or let children play on smartphones to keep them occupied, the poll found. The AA stressed that keeping children entertained - whether by traditional or modern methods - was vital in the wake of earlier research which has shown that motorists are 12 times more likely to be distracted by their children than by talking on a mobile phone. The latest AA research shows that of the 23,450 motorists surveyed, those in London and Northern Ireland were the least likely to entertain child passengers with traditional games like I Spy in which the first to spot a particular landmark or car is the winner. The game has even been turned into a successful series of books. Giving children a DVD to watch was most popular among drivers from Scotland, north-east England and north-west England. The AA also highlighted earlier statistics from academics which showed that children were 12 times more distracting than mobile phones to drivers. The AA also pointed to the fact that drivers or riders ‘failing to look properly’ was the most commonly cited contributory factor in UK road accidents, while sudden braking, swerving and loss of control (14 per cent) were also all common contributory factors. AA president Edmund King said: ‘Momentary distraction behind the wheel can be the difference between life and death. ‘Many . drivers do not consider children in the car as a potential distraction . but taking your eyes off the road for just a few seconds to deal with . what’s happening on the back seat can have dramatic consequences.’ He . added: ‘Keeping children entertained in the car is one of the best ways . to reduce the risk as they are less likely to be a distraction if they . are occupied with a game. ‘But . traditional in-car entertainment has changed over the generations.

A seventh grade girl has testified before a Federal judge for her right to compete on the boys' wrestling team at her school. Audriana Beattie, 12, from Williamsport, Pennsylvania, told the court on Wednesday: 'It doesn't matter that I'm a girl, because I'm just as good as [the boys].' She also said the sport has helped her overcome being bullied in the past. 'I can take my anger and use it, but not in a mean way, and do good,' she explained in her 40-minute testimony. Equality: 12-year-old Audriana Beattie (pictured), who has been wrestling since the third grad, has testified in front of a Federal judge for her right to play on her school's boys' team, because it doesn't have a girls' team . Members of the Pennsylvania Line Mountain School Board countered that letting her play on the boys' team would put her in physical danger, and that allowing body contact between boys and girls could make for awkward situations. In their federal lawsuit, Audriana's parents are arguing that the school's ban on co-ed competition in contact sports is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. What's more, Audriana has been wrestling against both boys and girls since the third grade and had a 5-3 record last year; four of those wins were against boys. But school board members say keeping boys and girls separated - especially in a sport like wrestling - is a necessity for several reasons. Board member Lauren Hackenburg asserted: 'I think it sends mixed messages. It's inconsistent to teach male students that it's fine to be aggressive and pin women down during a sport.' And Ron Neidig, another board member, testified that he is worried having a girl on the team will put the boys in an awkward and uncomfortable position. 'If they win, they've beaten a girl; if they lose, they are harassed by their teammates for being beaten by a girl,' he said. 'I've been bullied in the past, and wrestling helps me get over it. I can take my anger and use it, but not in a mean way' He added that he has seen Audriana crying after losing a match against a boy. 'It ended quickly. When the match was over, she was upset and looked to be in pain,' he recounted. Audriana asserted, however, that it's not out of the ordinary for competitors - including male competitors - to be upset after losing a match. 'I did cry. It's normal. I've seen a lot of boys cry and throw a fit and throw their headgear on the ground,' she explained. 'I wasn't hurt or in pain. It was just a matter of being emotional.' According to the Daily Item, school board President Troy Laudenslager argued that there are also 'sexual considerations' that come into play in their current policy. He explained that 'it's just not appropriate for males and females to be touching in such a way, particularly at ages 12 to 15, when hormones are just starting to kick in'. He cited a specific wrestling move, where 'you're supposed to stick your face in the girl's chest. Anywhere else you would be suspended,' he said. The school has said they would be willing to sponsor a girls' team if there is enough interest. A final decision is not likely to be made until early December; until then, Judge Matthew Brann has issued a temporary restraining order allowing Audriana to wrestle with the boys' team.","Members of the Line Mountain School Board argued that letting Audriana Beattie wrestle with boys could put her in physical danger .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:27 EST, 17 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:33 EST, 17 November 2013 . An ex-Catholic school teacher branded a 'perv' and 'creeper' by parents and students who accused him of inappropriately touching schoolgirls has won a defamation case. John Fischler, 49, was awarded $362,653 in compensation on Friday after jurors found the three families' false statements damaged the Holy Spirit school teacher's reputation. The Santa Clara County Superior Court . panel also found that one of the girls - the 'ringleader' who was 11 at the . time - acted with malice and is liable for punitive damages. The amount will be decided in the second phase of the trial starting Monday. Former Holy Spirit Catholic school teacher John Fischler was called a 'creeper' who inappropriately touched kids and peeked into their restroom by schoolgirls . 'I'm grateful the jury was able to see through the smoke screen and the truth came out,' Fischler told San Jose Mercury News. 'There's always going to be a scar. But the jury saw through the deception.' Fischler filed the lawsuit last month alleging he was the victim of a 'conspiracy' by 'classic bully parents' and a popular girl with a 'gang-leader-like personality'. In 2009, an 11-year-old girl said Fischler touched her buttocks while instructing her to . perform a squat thrust, according to UPI. He said he only touched her hips and was disciplined by school . administrators for violating their no-touching policy. In 2010, a group of girls including a sibling of the girl from the earlier incident said Fischler barged into a girl's bathroom where several of them were changing and leered at them. A police investigation revealed Fischler was forced to enter because the girls were shrieking. Police later found that the accusers coerced the other girls into lying to administrators about Fischler's conduct in an attempt to get him fired. John Fischler was a gym teacher when he was accused of inappropriate behavior . Even though he was cleared of wrongdoing, his name was listed for months on a state database available to law enforcement and other agencies seeking to screen employees who have contact with children. He no longer works at the school. While Fischler said he felt 'vindicated', the families and their attorneys were reportedly shocked by Friday's decision. Lawyer Lee J. Danforth said the verdict would have a chilling effect on the reporting of school abuse. 'If this trial prevents one little girl or one mother or father from reporting suspected abuse, then this is profoundly sad for our society,' he said. However Fischler's lawyer, Robert Vantress, said that the families gossiped about the allegations rather than merely reported them to school authorities. San Jose Mercury News reported the jurors came down hardest on the 'ringleader' student and the mother of the other two girls. It was reported the now 14-year-old girl's attitude alienated jurors, who sat grim-faced when she twice got off the witness stand and demonstrated a dance move and chant a school cheer.","Parents, girls ordered to pay $362,653 compensation for defaming ex-teacher John Fischler .

"By . Alex Ward . PUBLISHED: . 12:23 EST, 27 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:08 EST, 28 November 2013 . A Texas day care center owner who spent more than 20 years in prison for sexually abusing children in satanic rituals has been released after it emerged medical testimony that helped convict her was wrong. Frances Keller, 63, was released on bond late Tuesday night and her husband, Dan Keller, 71, who was convicted at the same time, will be released within a week in a deal reached with lawyers for the two, the Travis County district attorney's office said. 'There is a reasonable likelihood that (the medical expert's) false testimony affected the judgment of the jury and violated Frances Keller's right to a fair trial,' Rosemary Lehmberg, the district attorney for Travis County, which is located in central Texas and includes the city of Austin, said in a statement. Freed: Frances Keller, 63, pictured, was released on bond late Tuesday night . Dr Michael Mouw, the doctor whose testimony helped convict the Kellers in 1992, said in an affidavit presented to court this year that he had little training at the time on how to examine sexual abuse in children and came to the wrong conclusions in examining a child in the Keller case. 'While my testimony was based on a good faith belief at that time, I now realize my conclusion is not scientifically or medically valid, and that I was mistaken,' he said in the affidavit, which was obtained by Reuters. The Kellers were convicted of sexually abusing a 3-year-old girl in their care and faced accusations of dismembering corpses, putting blood in drinks served to children and flying children to Mexico, where they would be sexually abused. Mouw told the jury lacerations on one of the alleged victims was indication of abuse. This was the only physical evidence in the case and he has now recanted his testimony, saying what he thought were lacerations were actually normal physiology. According to Texas Public Radio, the child in the case now also says no abuse took place and that she had been instructed to make that claim. The . couple have always maintained their innocence and yesterday Fran Keller . walked out of Travis County Jail in Austin a free woman. Fran . Keller's attorney, Keith Hampton, said: 'The case was a true witch hunt . because the investigators actually believed that this was part of a . wide satanic conspiracy.' Falsely imprisoned? Dan Keller, pictured in prison in 2008, is also expected to be freed after spending 21 years in prison for sexual abuse of children in their care . He said the therapist's techniques — which were used to convince the children, parents and investigators that the Kellers committed human sacrifices, flew the children to Mexico and dismembered human bodies in cemeteries — have been debunked. Prosecutors put two constables on . trial in connection with the Keller case, but the judge dismissed those . charges a year after the Kellers were convicted. Travis . County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg issued a statement saying . she agreed to release the Kellers on bond after learning of Dr Mouw's . testimony. She said: 'I agreed that there is a reasonable likelihood that his false testimony affected the judgment of the jury. 'The . Court of Criminal Appeals will review both cases. No further action or . decisions on the case will be made until that review is finalized.' A judge still has to sign off on Dan Keller's release. Hampton said he did not expect prosecutors to seek a retrial. The jury convicted the Kellers after . prosecutors obtained convictions in similar cases in California, . Massachusetts and Florida that gained national attention. Convictions in . many of those cases have been overturned or prosecutors have petitioned . to vacate the cases. Day care center: Here is the home and former day care center owned and run by Fran Keller, who was swept up in a national hysteria over satanic ritual abuse . Hampton said after both of the Kellers are released, he will file court papers to have them exonerated and declared innocent. In . the appeal he filed in January, Mr Hampton accused the Austin police of . withholding evidence that would have cleared the Kellers and said the . judge allowed prosecutors to introduce unscientific psychological . evidence at trial by an unqualified witness. The Kellers were sentence after just a six day trial, according to KUT. The couple were among hundreds of childcare workers who . were accused of being part of a group of Satan worshipers who engaged . in ritual child abuse across America during the 1980s and 1990s. These cases were triggered by sensational accusations of widespread sexual abuse at a . California preschool in what was known as the McMartin case. 'The Keller case is definitely about the panic back then,' Keith Hampton, a lawyer for Frances Keller, told Reuters. Hampton . filed a 128-page writ earlier this year in which he sought to refute . the accusations leveled against the Kellers as well as describe the . panic about daycare in that era. Free: The couple have always maintained their innocence and on Tuesday Fran Keller, pictured, walked out of Travis County Jail in Austin a free woman. Daytime talk show hosts stoked the fire with segments describing horrors inflicted upon children at daycare. Between 1984 to 1989, some 100 people nationwide were charged with ritual sex abuse and 50 were put on trial, according to Debbie Nathan of the National Center for Reason and Justice, which works to free those wrongly imprisoned. Many have since questioned a number of the cases, which they said were based on faulty testimony coaxed out of children from purported experts on recovered memories and backed by dubious medical testimony on signs of sexual abuse. Most of the charges were dismissed in the McMartin case. Hampton sees more people falsely convicted being set free.'You are soon going to see a flood of exoneration on these sexual abuse cases,' he said. The release also comes hot on the heels of four San Antonio women imprisoned for sexually assaulting two girls in 1994 being freed last week after a judge agreed with their defense attorney and prosecutors that their 1998 convictions for sexual assault should not stand due to faulty expert testimony. In that case, another doctor recanted her testimony that what she thought were internal injuries indicating sexual abuse were actually anatomically normal.","Frances Keller was sentenced to 48 years in prison in 1992 for alleged child abuse at a preschool she ran with her husband .

"By . Maneesh Pandey and Shibaji Roychoudhury . PUBLISHED: . 19:44 EST, 14 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:01 EST, 14 December 2013 . Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung has recommended President's Rule in Delhi . It's going to be President's Rule for Delhi, with Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung in charge. Top sources in the L-G's office have told Mail Today that President Pranab Mukherjee has been advised that no party is in a position to form the government in the state. ""A file has been sent to the Rashtrapati Bhavan recommending President's Rule,"" the source told Mail Today. The move came very shortly after Aam Aadmi Party's Arvind Kejriwal met Jung and asked for 10 more days to clear the fog hanging over government formation and set an 18-point charter of demands for the Congress and BJP to accept their support. But it seems that the academic-turned-administrator is in no mood to waste the electorate's time and energy any further and wants to set the administrative process rolling, which has been in cold storage since the code of conduct came into force ahead of the Delhi elections. A top official told Mail Today: ""The L-G has recommended the President's rule, but with a difference. The city under the recommended President's rule administered by the Delhi L-G will go back to pre-1993 days when there was no Assembly and it did not have advisors for the then-L-G. ""The current L-G is of the firm view that Delhi is a small state which can be managed without such advice, bearing an indirect load on the state exchequer."" This really means that the Jung will be effectively administering the state till there are fresh polls, which could be with the general elections next year. The L-G appears to be responding to the need for urgency being expressed in the Capital to get a government going, with questions being raised about the intentions of political parties. With the results of assembly polls a week old now, the political situation of the Capital continues to be uncertain, with neither BJP nor AAP consenting to form the government. Silence . The BJP has been maintaining a constant silence under the guise of a ""fractured mandate"" and has kept itself aloof of the political churning. The AAP, meanwhile, has been keeping Delhiites guessing with its own set of demands for both BJP and Congress. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had quite a lucrative offer - complete unconditional support to form the Government in Delhi from the vanquished Congress. Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal addresses the media after meeting Delhi's Lieutenant-Governor in New Delhi . Even on Saturday, after meeting Jung, Kejriwal has taken a conditional stand to form the Government and has put the onus on the Congress and BJP, asking for 10 more days. But nothing concrete is expected, says a top government source, particularly after Congress MLAs pointed fingers at AAP for ""shirking the moral responsibility to respect the Delhi mandate"". The AAP chief has also written to both Sonia Gandhi and Rajnath Singh asking their stand on 18 demands for developmental work in Delhi that the AAP intends to see through, if they want to be part of the government in Delhi. Many within the Congress and BJP have rubbished the 18 demands as ""delaying tactics"". The move is also being seen as an attempt to put the government ball into the hands of the larger parties. Congress general secretary Shakeel Ahmad on Saturday said the Congress will take a few days to reply to the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) letter setting conditions for forming the government in Delhi. ""We will examine the letter and will get back to Arvind Kejriwal in a day or two,"" Ahmad said soon after Congress president Sonia Gandhi forwarded him the letter by Kejriwal. Congress leaders Arvinder Singh Lovely (left) and Haroon Yusuf (right) at a press conference at ITO in New Delhi . Ahmad had earlier written to Kejriwal about the readiness of the Congress to support an AAP government from outside. However, the Congress's Delhi MLAs hit out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) over its reluctance on forming the government in Delhi. They accused the AAP of shirking off responsibility. In a direct attack against Kejriwal, Congress MLA Haroon Yusuf slammed the party's 18-point questionnaire to Sonia Gandhi, saying that that by doing so, Kejriwal and his party members were ridiculing the democracy. ""We had expressed before the L-G, our willingness to support the AAP from outside just to ensure that the public mandate is respected. ""However, this act by the AAP whereby they wrote to the Congress, imposing conditions on executive matters, is unreasonable. Today they have written to the Congress, will they write to the United Nations or American President Barack Obama next?"" Yusuf asked. Reacting on the issue, another Congress MLA Arvinder Singh Lovely said: ""These conditions deal with issues that are a state government's prerogative. So if the AAP comes to power, they must bring about these changes. Why do they then need to impose them upon us? Did they ask us before making these promises?"". Delhi BJP chief Vijay Goel has accused the AAP of playing 'dirty politics' Shibaji Roychoudhury . The BJP'S Delhi unit, which is upset with the AAP's 18-point agenda, has charged that the latter's leader Arvind Kejriwal is playing ""dirty politics to hog the media attention"". Delhi BJP chief Vijay Goel said: ""The AAP is simply trying to be in the limelight and divert the attention of Delhiites with silly acts. What does it mean by the 18-point letter sent to us? If the AAP forms the government, it can regulate and implement whatever the party plans to do in Delhi"". Goel alleged that the AAP's 18-point agenda is a ploy to distract the attention of voters from the fact that the party is shirking its responsibility though it is in a position to form a government. ""The AAP doesn't want the people to realise that it will be held responsible for the inconvenience caused to them if Delhi goes to re-polls,"" he said. Several BJP workers wondered why the AAP convener had sought 10 days' time from Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung. ""If the party is firm that it will not form the government, why does it need 10 days' time to come to a conclusion? What are AAP workers aspiring to achieve?"" a senior Delhi BJP leader asked on condition of anonymity. BJP leaders also criticised the AAP for being fickle-minded. ""The party had made it clear that it would not take support from anyone. Then Prashant Bhushan made a statement saying if the AAP could lend support to the BJP in Delhi if its demands were met. ""After that Kejriwal said under no circumstances the AAP would be associated with corrupt parties such as the BJP and the Congress. Now, he is again back with his dirty games,"" Goel added.","Kejriwal asks Lt-Gov Jung for 10 more days to form government .

David Cameron's brilliant but eccentric guru and friend Steve Hilton was known for padding round No 10 in bare feet and scruffy tracksuit bottoms. Although stuffy Whitehall mandarins frowned, they were powerless to stop him roaming shoeless along the corridors of power looking  more like a beach bum than a political strategist. But it was a different story when Mr Hilton, who moved to his beloved California last year, tried to board an aircraft in the US in the same style recently. Steve Hilton was stopped and told he was not allowed to board a plane without footwear . Having spent the morning on the beach, he didn't bother to put shoes on for the flight. But when he tried to board the plane with wife Rachel Whetstone, a Google executive, and their two young  children, he was stopped and told he was not allowed to do so without footwear, even in California. Reports of what happened next vary. According to one, he became embroiled in a heated row with officials who refused to back down until he paid a $200 surcharge to get on board. According to another, he  persuaded an employee at the airport to give him a pair of shoes, even though they were far too big, and scrambled inside just before the cabin doors were due to close. The son of Hungarian immigrants, Mr Hilton, 44, was an Oxford University contemporary of Mr Cameron and the architect of the campaign to bury the Tories' 'nasty party' image. He left No 10 to work at Stanford University in California last year, but returned in the summer to help write the Prime Minister's party conference speech. The airport incident is not the first time Mr Hilton has been involved in a heated exchange. One of the reasons he  left No 10 was his frustration with officials who disliked his radical policies as much as his idiosyncratic fashion sense. Having spent the morning on the beach, Hilton hadn't bothered to put shoes on for the flight . During one spectacular bust-up with Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the Civil Service, Mr Hilton yelled: 'You f***ing lied.' Mr Hilton had called for the 440,000-strong organisation to be cut by 70 to 90 per cent, with bureaucrats' work handed over to private companies instead. He claimed that if Whitehall was as efficient today as it had been at the height of the British Empire, there would be no more than 4,000 civil servants. In a defiant message aimed at Mr Hilton, Sir Bob fought back on Twitter, saying: 'I am a champion of change in the Civil Service but I will also defend what is good about it. 'We need to hang on to our values of integrity, honesty, objectivity, impartiality.' Mr Hilton's impatience got him into more trouble when he accompanied Mr Cameron to a Tory conference in Birmingham. The prickly aide was marched off in handcuffs and fined £80 after a row with a ticket inspector and police at New Street Station. Attempting to rush home after the event, he had a valid ticket, but failed to produce it on time. During the dispute, Mr Hilton shouted the word 'w****r', leading to him being detained in a police cell. A statement from British Transport Police said that 'once the man had calmed down', he had been issued with a penalty notice for disorder under Section 5 of the Public Order Act. Mr Cameron had just delivered a speech - which Mr Hilton had helped to draft - in which he  condemned the 'culture of incivility' towards the police. Mr Hilton is widely believed to have inspired the balding, pretentious character Stewart Pearson in the BBC's popular political satire, The Thick of It. A friend said: 'Steve is one of the nicest blokes you will ever meet,  but he can't stand the jobsworth  mentality.' Mr Hilton was not available for comment.","Cameron's friend Steve Hilton padded round No 10 in bare feet .

Yesterday early portraits revealed how teen-queen Miss Willerton simply masked her poor skin with make-up as she confidently entered the city’s beauty competition. Now it would appear the young star hopes to ensure her survival in the ITV jungle by seeking the sympathy vote with tales of playground bullying. Despite claiming she was once much larger and covered in spots Miss Willerton, then 17, still had confidence to put herself forward for, and win, a series of local beauty pageants, including Miss Bath and Miss Bristol. Wearing her finalist sash and a white dress, Miss Willerton, wore immaculate hair, no spectacles and little foundation make-up to cover her skin’s unpleasant blemishes. Bizarrely at the time, the ‘teased’ Miss Bristol winner told how she has been bullied at school for her . ‘unfortunate’ looks but had been undeterred when putting herself up . against her peers.

For me, I was an athlete. ‘I wasn’t trying to be a model, but pretty much every single week on Twitter I get somebody commenting on the way I look.’ Attempting to comfort her, Miss Willerton claimed she too had experienced unkind remarks as a young girl, adding: ‘People say nasty things and you have to drive your inner confidence. ‘Tell that to the 15-year-old covered in acne and braces and glasses. I’ve been there.’ But yesterday classmates were unable to recall the playground insults stating she always had a nice figure and was viewed by her peers as ‘a good looking girl’.

She said: ‘I think you will struggle to find a bad photograph of Amy I went to secondary school with her and she always good looking – all the boys liked her. ‘I never remember her being overweight she was always thin. If she was bigger than she is now she wasn’t much bigger. Stunning: Former class mate Andreas Mavrides said Miss Willerton 'was never considered not attractive' ‘She was always smart, I think she may have has bad skin but she was never a not attractive.’ However a close friend, who wished not to be named, admitted she remembered the star struggling with poor skin in her teens. Before entering the reality show jungle it was revealed the beauty queen has been nervous of appearing without make-up on the ITV1 prime time show. Miss Willerton, who was still suffering with her skin in the early days of her pageant career, branded it was something of a ‘personal challenge’ after she suffered from chronic acne in her late teens. Prior to starting her jungle experience it was reported the model underwent a series of skin peels, vitamin injections and micro-needling treatments to combat a possible outbreak of acne during her time in the camp. Model Miss Willerton planned to attend Cardiff University after achieving a string of A’s at A level at Redland Green School, Bristol, but instead chose to pursue her pageant career after being crowned Miss Bristol in 2010. The reality star, who was crowned Miss Universe Great Britain in June, won the reality show Signed By Katie Price in 2011 but turned down the contract with the glamour model’s management company. She entered the Miss Universe contest in Moscow last month, despite not winning she was the first UK contestant in 30 years to reach the top ten.","Miss Willerton claimed she was bullied for wearing glasses and suffering from chronic acne .

A golden urn believed to contain the remnant of Budda's body has been stolen from its shrine in Cambodia. Officials in the south east Asian country said the relics, which have enormous religion and cultural significance for Cambodians, were taken from the mountain shrine close to the capital Phnom Penh. A government spokesman called for those responsible to be brought to justice. He said: 'This relic has been respected by . Buddhist followers for thousands of years. 'This theft cannot be accepted. The perpetrator and any associates who . connived to commit such a crime must be prosecuted according to the law . of Cambodia.' Police said a guard was woken by a barking dog on Tuesday. It was then the guard discovered the lock to the shrine's door had been damaged and the urn had disappeared. Officers quizzed 13 of the shrine's guards and detained six as suspects, but said the authorities had no information about the relics' location. The relics were moved by the late King Norodom Sihanouk in 2002 from Phnom Penh to the mountain shrine in the former royal city of Udong in a ceremony attended by tens of thousands of people. Several countries in Asia . possess relics believed to come from the body of Buddha. The relics were moved by the late King Norodom Sihanouk in 2002, from Phnom Penh, pictured, to the mountain shrine in the former royal city of Udong . The urn was housed inside one of four stupas - a mound-like or semi-hemispherical structure containing Buddhist relics - in the city of Udong, the former capital of Cambodia. Perched in the hills around 22 miles from Phnom Penh, the city was the home of the royal family between 1618 and 1866. At the northwestern corner of the hill four stupas can be seen piercing the skyline. The first is the tomb of King Monivong (r.1927 to 1941). The second is said to be the tomb of King Ang Duog (r. 1845-59) and the third is the tomb of King Sorivopor (r. prior to 1618). The fourth stupa is where the urn, which is said to contain Buddha's remains, was stored. A statue of Buddha at Vihear Preah Kep, on the hill of the royal treasury in Udong in Cambodia . Siddhartha Gautama Buddha, known simply as Buddha, was a sage or wise person, on whose teachings the religion of Buddhism was founded. Buddha means the 'awakened one' or the 'enlightened one'. Buddhism is the story of one man's spiritual journey to enlightenment, and the teachings that derived from it. Historians have estimated Siddhartha Gautama lived between 490 BCE and circa 410 BCE. He was born into a royal family in a Nepalese village in the foothills of the Himalayas. It is said that having lived in a royal palace, Siddhartha Gautama, had been sheltered from seeing those struck down by illness and poverty. Having married and fathered a child he ventured from the royal enclosure where he is said to have laid eyes on a sick man, an old man and a corpse, for the first time. He learned age, sickness and death are inevitable for everyone. On his trip he came across a monk and saw the encounter as a sign he should leave his fortunate life and live as a homeless holy man. Depriving himself of life's luxuries and living in a state of extreme abstinence for six years did not provide him with an answer to escaping suffering in the world. Instead Siddhartha Gautama found a middle way living his life between poverty and luxury. It is said that when he was sitting underneath a Bodhi tree, Siddhartha became deeply immersed in meditation, reflecting on life. It was then that he achieved enlightenment and became Buddha. The site at which Buddha achieved enlightenment, the Mahabodhi Temple, is now a pilgrimage site. Buddha spent his life teaching and the religion to this day focuses on the importance of teaching.","Urn believed to contain the remnants of Buddha's body stolen from shrine .

An ancient Roman statue that inspired Mark Twain and Lord Byron to comment on its beauty is to go on display in Washington DC. The Dying Gaul, a marble statue that was unearthed in Rome in the 1620s, is being loaned to the National Gallery of Art until March next year. Believed by early historians and writers to be a gladiator, the statue had been a popular tourist attraction for centuries. Historic: Crowds file past the sculpture of the 'Dying Gaul,' an ancient Roman sculpture after it was unveiled at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC . Enthralled: The exhibition of the Dying Gaul in Washington, DC, is the first time the statue has left Europe since being discovered in the 1620s . When Twain visited it in 1867 he wrote: 'We saw the Dying Gladiator at the Capitol, and I think that even we appreciated that wonder of art.' And Romantic poet Lord Byron included the statue in his 1818 work From Canto IV of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. 'I see before me the Gladiator lie: / He leans upon his hand -- his manly brow / Consents to death, but conquers agony'. On tour: Ancient Roman statue the Dying Gaul is to go on display for the first time in the U.S. Closer inspection: A visitor examines the sculpture 'Dying Gaul,' after it was unveiled at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC . Expressive: The contorted expressions of the marble statue have been praised for centuries . On loan: The Dying Gaul is traveling outside of Italy for the first time in more than two centuries . The statue, which was renamed the Dying Gaul by 18th Century scholars, is said to have been based on a 3rd Century BC bronze sculpted to mark a victory over the Gauls, McClatchy DC reported. It is lauded for the expressions on the statue's face, as the Gaul is seen contorted with pain as he dies from a chest wound. 'A universally acknowledged . masterpiece, the Dying Gaul is a deeply moving tribute to the human . spirit,' Earl A. Powell III, director of the gallery, said. Inspiration: Mark Twain wrote about his visit to the statue in 1867 . 'An . image of a conquered enemy, the sculpture represents courage in defeat, . composure in the face of death and dignity,' he added. Lord Byron was inspired by the statue, writing: . 'I see before me the Gladiator lie:He leans upon his hand - his manly browConsents to death, but conquers agony,And his droop'd head sinks gradually low -And through his side the last drops, ebbing slowFrom the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,Like the first of a thunder-shower; and nowThe arena swims around him - he is gone,Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hail'd the wretch who won.' Its appearance at the Washington gallery - the first time it has left Italy in more than 200 years - is part of the Dream of Rome program, in which 'the Eternal Masterpieces' are exhibited in the U.S. 'We are very pleased to bring to Washington a stunning masterpiece that has not left Italian soil since its return to Rome from Paris in 1816,' Claudio Parisi Presicce, director of Capitoline Museums, where the statue is usually displayed, said. 'In 1797, Napoleonic forces had taken the sculpture to France with the intention of keeping it there. 'Its journey across the Atlantic today is further proof of the strong and fruitful collaboration between our countries.' The statue, believed to have been created in the first or second century AD, was found in the gardens of Villa Ludovisi. Centre of attention: The Dying Gaul has drawn crowds since it was unveiled at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC . Debut: The loan to Washington's National Gallery of Art marks the first time the statue has left Rome in 200 years . Sublime: The Dying Gaul sculpture was created during the first or second century AD and unearthed in Rome in the 1620s . The earliest record of it comes from a 1623 description calling it a dying gladiator, but its fame spread thanks to an engraving by French artist François Perrier in 1638. Soon royalty in Spain and France were commissioning bronze replicas, and Thomas Jefferson also listed the statue as a list of antiquities he hoped to acquire for a planned museum. The statue will be on display until March 16. The first artifact to make its way across the Atlantic under the art exchange was Michelangelo's David Apollo, followed by Leonardo da Vinci's Codex on the Flight of Birds. Cultural exchange: Rome's Capitoline Museum is loaning the Dying Gaul to the National Gallery of Art as part of an artifact swap .","Dying Gaul to go in display in National Gallery of Art .

His ability to dodge the enemy’s bullet is the stuff of legend, but James Bond was far more likely to die from liver disease or a drunken car crash, say doctors. They claim Bond’s skilled exploits in the field of espionage – and the bedroom – were all the more remarkable in light of his drinking habits. While on Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Bond was putting away more than 90 drinks a week - four times the recommended limit. Sean Connery as James Bond takes a bath in Diamonds are forever with the . vodka and Martini close by. Researchers claim Bond would have been a . functioning alcoholic putting away 90 drinks a week . Astonishingly considering his prowess with the gun, it is claimed that his fondness for a vodka martini ‘shaken not stirred’ may have been the result of his hands shaking from alcohol-induced tremor. Doctors who carried out a study of his unhealthy lifestyle conclude 007, most recently played by Daniel Craig in Skyfall, was a ‘functioning alcoholic’. Cheers: Pierce Brosnan's Bond gets stuck into yet another Martini . The last thing you’d want him to do is dismantle a bomb or give you a lift home, they argue. Patrick . Davies, from Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, and a colleague . read all 14 Ian Fleming novels over a period of six months. They totted up Bond’s alcohol consumption and found he was way over the recommended limit for safe drinking by men. The NHS recommends no more than three or four units a day - 28 units a week - while Bond was drinking on average between 65 and 92 units a week. The researchers said the stress of ‘working with international terrorists and high stakes gamblers’ may have driven him to drink excessively - before getting into his Bentley. The novels reveal he was more in danger of dying in a road accident or from liver disease than an enemy’s bullet, say the researchers in the British Medical Journal Christmas issue. Dr Davies, from Nottingham University Hospital, said ‘James Bond is a functioning alcoholic, which really isn’t very consistent with his ability as a spy. ‘You wouldn’t want a high functioning alcoholic having to dismantle a bomb. ‘In Casino Royale he drinks more than 39 units then jumps in a car (his 1930 Bentley 4.5 litre) and has a high speed chase, crashes and then spends 14 days in hospital.’ This would be eight pints of beer followed by eight glasses of wine, while his weekly consumption, 92 units, is approximately one and a half bottles of wine a day. Dr Davies added: ‘In one sitting it would be a two litre bottle of whisky, three glasses of wine and two pints of beer. ‘In real life a normal person wouldn’t be able to function like that, it would be impossible. ‘You wouldn’t be able to stand straight, let alone having the clarity of thought. While on Her Majesty's Secret Service, Bond was putting away more than 90 drinks a week - four times the recommended limit . ‘Despite his alcohol consumption, he . is still described as being able to carry out highly complicated tasks . and function at an extraordinarily high level. ‘This . is likely to be pure fiction.’ In all 14 books, 123.5 days were . described, though Bond was unable to consume alcohol for 36 days because . of being imprisoned by hostile forces, or recovering from injuries . sustained while on duty. Out of the 87.5 days on which he was able to drink, he abstained on just 12.5 days.The most Bond ever drank on one day was almost 50 units in From Russia with Love. ‘We . suspect that the famous catchphrase ‘shaken, not stirred’ could be . because of alcohol induced tremor affecting his hands’, say the doctors. In real life, he would have been prey to alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, impotence, and other alcohol and smoking-related health problems. Bond's creator Ian Fleming, who died aged 56, was a heavy drinker and smoker . ‘In reality he would be at high risk of sexual dysfunction too, which totally goes against the image of the character’ says Dr Davies. The fate of his creator is probably the most sobering aspect of the story, he added. ‘Ian Fleming died at 56 and people say Bond is partly based on him. ‘He drunk a lot and he smoked a lot - it’s possible Bond might have had a similar life span if he had been a real person. ‘His risk of death would have been 1.74 times the average, and his risk of cirrhosis seven to 16 times the average. ‘You can’t drink heavily and be high functioning. You will always pay for this kind of behaviour, unfortunately. ‘The message is that you shouldn’t drink this amount and expect to get away with it.’","Fictional spy was knocking back between 65 and 92 units a week .

A now 21-year-old man accused of shooting his father in the face with a shotgun in 2009, prompted in part by a joke about how the boy wasn’t man enough to be with actress Megan Fox, was found guilty of first degree murder in a Florida court Monday. Jason Beckman was 17 when he snapped and, with a shotgun, blasted his South Miami City Commissioner father in the face and neck while he was in the shower. While an appeal seemed likely after the judge refused to allow into evidence Beckman’s Asperger’s Syndrome or his initial police interview where he vehemently denied committing the crime, a string of witnesses for the prosecution painted a very sinister picture of Beckman and his years-long desire to murder his father and others. Beckman now faces life in prison. Guilty: On one of his final days at trial, convicted murderer Jason Beckman smiled and waived goodbye to the court. He now faces life in prison for murdering his father in 2009 . Grisly: While Beckman's South Miami Commissioner father Jay Beckman showered in April 2009, Jason shot him dead with a shotgun . According to a jailhouse informant who testified last week, the final straw in Beckman's hatred . for his father came after Jay Beckman cracked a joke about actress Megan . Fox, which prompted Beckman to finally murder his father. Initially, . Jason was charged with manslaughter after telling police he . accidentally discharged the 12-gauge Browning Citori shotgun by tripping . over it. However, the . charge was later upgraded to first-degree murder when it emerged in the . course of the investigation that the teen had admitted to a neighbor . that he planned one day to kill his father with the shotgun. In court Tuesday, Beckman’s inmate . Michael Nistal told jurors that just before the deadly shooting, Jason . asked his father what he thought about Hollywood starlet Megan Fox. 'His father told him he [Jason] wouldn’t know what to do with that,' Nistal recounted to the jurors, according to the Miami Herald. The . seemingly innocent comment uttered by Jason's father, whom he allegedly . hated and talked about killing for years, pushed the 17-year-old over . the edge, according to the prosecution. Confessors? The lynchpins in the case against Beckman were a jailhouse snitch named Michael Nistal (left), who testified that Beckman confessed to him that he'd killed his father and Lisa Syren, who told the court that Beckman showed her the gun he'd eventually use to kill his father and told her he planned to do so . Murder weapon: Jason Beckman claimed that he went to show his father this 12-gague Browning Citori he had just assembled but slipped and fell, causing the shotgun to fire . Gory: The city chief was shot at a very close range in the shower, the blast nearly blowing his face off and dousing the room with blood (pictured top left) Final straw: Jason's inmate testified that the . teen told him that just before the shooting, he asked his father what he . thought of actress Megan Fox, and Mr Beckman responded that 'he . wouldn't know what to do with that' ‘So he went and got a shotgun and blew his head off. He missed his head and shot his face and part of his neck,’ the inmate said. Nistal added that Jason told him he then poked his father's body with the weapon to see if he was still alive. A photo taken of the teen after his arrest shows him standing barefoot in a grey T-shirt with no visible signs of blood on it, which the prosecutors say suggests that Jason made no effort to come to his father’s aid as he lay dying in the blood-spattered bathroom. Jason Beckman’s defense team, however, insist that the shooting was accidental. Following his arrest, prosecutors say the teenager came clean about the killing to inmates, including Nistal, at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. Nistal is serving a seven-year sentence for a burglary spree that culminated in a deadly high-speed chase. The convicted felon told the court that Beckman planned to use insanity or self-defense to beat the murder rap, and also talked about killing witnesses after the trial. Jay Beckman, a South Miami city . commissioner, was found dead in his Florida home April 12, 2009, after . his son called the authorities to say he had accidentally killed him. During . questioning after the killing, Jason told police that he had a . 'love-hate' relationship with his father, who had been raising him alone . since his mother died from cancer in 1998. Jason . told police he went to show his father a shotgun he had just assembled . but slipped and fell, causing the shotgun to fire, reported the Miami . Herald at the time. Crime scene: The deadly shooting happened inside the Beckmans' South Miami home on Easter Sunday . Evidence: This photo taken after Jason's arrest shows him in a grey T-shirt with no visible signs on blood on it, which the prosecutors say suggests that he made no effort to come to his father's aid . In her opening statement last Wednesday, prosecutor Jessica Dobbins said that Jason kept a 'hit list' of people he did not like on a piece of notebook paper, and that his father's name was at the top, CBS Miami reported. Defense attorney Tara Kawass responded to the allegations by saying that Jason's outbursts, in which he talked about wanting to kill his father, could be attributed to his Asperger's syndrome - a mild form of autism that caused him to say outlandish things and speak out of turn. Hit list: Prosecutors say for years Jason had been talking about killing his father, whose name was at the top of a list of people he did not like . Kawass added that his list-keeping was a form of coping with his condition, which made it difficult for him to make friends. But the attorney insisted that while her client was socially awkward, he was never violent or aggressive, and he did not pull the trigger on purpose on Easter Sunday in 2009. During testimony on Friday, Jason’s former classmate Jennifer Kaiser told jurors that in the eighth grade she saw the teen bring gun magazines to school, and he once told her that she was on his list, CBS Miami reported. Armando Torres, another one-time schoolmate of Beckman’s, also testified that he heard him say on multiple occasions that he wanted to kill his father.","Jason Beckman, 21, has been found guilty in the shooting death of his city commissioner father, 52-year-old Jay Beckman, in April 2009 .

But one of its lesser known attractions is the vibrantly painted trucks that can be spotted travelling around the country. As far from the traditionally dull looking arctic lorries as its possible to get, these hand-painted trucks are pieces of moving art. The ancient Pakistani practice of drivers decorating their trucks has its roots in the days of the raj when craftsmen made colourful horse drawn carriages for the gentry. Moving art: Brightly-decorated trucks that have been hand-painted by their drivers travel through Shikarpur in Pakistan . Enjoy the scenery: A fully decorated Pakistani truck makes it way along the Karakoram highway in central Hunza valley, Pakistan . Years of history: The tradition of drivers decorating their trucks dates back to the days of the raj when craftsmen made colourful horse drawn carriages for the gentry . Unique: A Pakistani labourer loads vegetables into a truck which has been decorated with a colourful creature similar to a peacock in Islamabad . In the driver's seat: A Pakistani truck driver peers from his colorfully decorated truck window as he waits to load goods for transportation in Islamabad . The tradition continued with drivers decorating their vehicles to attract custom and to thank God for prosperity. Different regions developed their own styles over time and many of the images painted on the side of the vehicles served as reminders of home for drivers on long journeys. Trucks from the region of Swat are distinctive for their carved wooden doors and limited use of plastic and hammered metalwork. Although Pakistan is often described as a nation of low economic status, large amounts of money will change hands to decorate trucks. Many truck owners will pay between $3,000 and $5,000 to decorate their vehicles. Nationwide: Colourful and intricately painted trucks are a tradition in Pakistan and each region has developed its own style . Costly: The average owner of a truck may spend over $3,000 on paint and metal designs for his vehicle which can be three times more than his monthly wages . Constant companion: The average truck owner may see his truck more than his wife so they feel it is important to make it look pretty . Pretty but lethal: There are around 180,000 creaking trucks and tankers plying Pakistan's treacherous highways . Dividing art: Truck art was also a way to differentiate trucks in Pakistan from those in India after the countries split in 1947 . One paint workshop owner Hussain Noor, 58, has been painting trucks for 43 years and one of his trucks is displayed in a museum in Germany. This collection of images shows drivers adding the finishing touches of paint to their trucks at his studio in Rawalpindi. Many have painted colorful floral patterns or creative depictions of heroes alongside calligraphy of poetic verses on their vehicles. Each part of the truck is decorated differently and can contain numerous themes. Shelf life: The vehicles have an average age of 30 years and every part is replaced to keep the vehicle running as long as possible . For good luck: The tradition of truck painting remained largely unchanged for the last 50 years, with drivers decorating their vehicles to attract custom and to thank God for prosperity .

Hertz is being sued by one of its customers after he was allegedly racially abused by employees of the car rental firm on Facebook. Maurice Howard, 27, filed the complaint against the firm last week after staff at Hertz Rent-A-Car at Maui Airport, Hawaii, took to the social networking site to insult him in Pidgin English after he had hired a vehicle there. Mr Howard's attorney, Burton Gould, described the employee's comments as a 'hate crime' in a statement. Legal action: A 27-year-old man is suing car hire firm Hertz over allegations that members of staff racially abused him on Facebook (file picture) The group of employees allegedly took to Facebook in February 2012 to describe Mr Howard as a pretentious black man who rented impressive cars including BMWs. They mocked Mr Howard claiming that his credit card was often declined. The posts use terminology that Mr Howard's lawyers claim imply that he is a black man of low social status who aspires, in a crude manner, to appear to be of higher status. A post by another employee, Samantha Chun, reads: 'Run that faka over!!! lol.' Suing: Maurice Howard is also attempting to sue Facebook claiming that is violated its anti-bullying policy by allowing the posts which appeared in February 2012 . One of the members of staff named in the law suit, Shawn Akina, allegedly described Mr Howard as a 'broke ass faka who act like he get planny money'. Mr Howard is also taking legal action against . Facebook claiming that the site violated its policy banning content that . could be seen as bullying or causing emotional distress. His lawyer claims that his client's civil rights were violated and cites negligence on the part of both Hertz and Facebook for allowing the group to mock him. According to the Huffington Post, the Lawsuit says: 'Clearly the posting attacking and bullying Howard is a prima facie case of Facebook's own definition of ""harmful content"". 'Moreover, these same individuals, continue to have accounts on Facebook, despite Facebook's policies which explicitly state that such ""harmful content"" being posted on Facebook is grounds an individual's account be terminated.' The group of employees were all either fired or resigned following the incident, according to the lawsuit. The posts were reportedly deleted once Mr Howard was made aware of them. Hawaii Pidgin English is a form of Creole language based on English and used by many residents of Hawaii in everyday conversation. It was originally used as a form of communication between English speaking residents and non English speakers and is influenced by a range of languages including Portuguese and Cantonese. Hawaii's official languages are English and Hawaiian. Many natives of Hawaii, pictured, speak Hawaii pidgin in everyday life .","Maurice Howard was allegedly mocked by staff at Maui Airport Hertz .

A pub landlord who tastes ales for a living has discovered he is allergic to BEER. Alastair Scott was the first in the UK to qualify as a beer sommelier after it became a recognised qualification two years ago. However, after working in the pub industry for more than 20 years, he was devastated to find out he couldn't stomach beer any longer. Alistair took a home intolerance test after feeling unwell for months but was shocked to find that this was all down to the yeast in beer. Alistair, 49, said: 'I almost wanted to double check it and get it changed! 'I didn't think it was right, I just didn't believe it. 'I was coughing a lot and spluttering in the mornings, and generally feeling tired and lethargic. 'I wouldn't have done anything about it if other people hadn't complained - it was my family that made me find out because I had just accepted I wasn't very well. 'I was worried about what I wasn't going to be able to have but I never thought it would be beer. The father-of-three earns a living by travelling around the country, taste-testing beer. He said: I'm in the pub for work three or four days a week and it's rare that I don't have a drink for work purposes 3 or 4 times a week. 'Sometimes I can drink up to six ales in a pub.' Alastair's work involves reviewing beer and matching specific ales to different foods. He added: 'Beer is a big part of my life and I just cant avoid it, I'm heavily involved in the pub industry, I just love it. 'It's a great job - it's hard work but I feel I'm lucky to be able to visit pubs and help them through their beer.' Worrying times: The father-of-three travels across the UK taste testing beer for a living . Alastair, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, used an at -home YorkTest kit which showed he suffered a severe reaction to yeast, which is found in many of the things he enjoys every day. He said: 'It's in beer, wine, bread, even salad dressing. 'It could have been caused by drinking too much of it. I mainly drink ales and they are very heavily yeasted so I may have just overloaded my body.' Mr Scott owns the Square and Compass bar in Harrogate, Yorkshire (pictured) along with another bar in Bristol . But as beer is essential to his job, Alistair has been forced to take on a new approach to get him through the working week. 'I now sip not sup, that's more difficult than you think because you have to properly drink ales to decipher the full flavour. 'You can't just swill it round your mouth and spit it out like you can do with wine. 'I'm just going to have a bit now though rather than drinking full pints!' Despite the allergy Mr Scott claims he will carry on drinking beer in smaller amouts . Alistair, who owns two pubs in Bristol and Harrogate, has had to change what he drinks socially because of his new-founded allergy. 'Duvel ale was always my favourite beer but it has a very large amount of yeast in it so I've now switched to drinking lager. 'I spoke to Carlsberg who told me there are only trace amounts of wheat in most lagers as they are so heavily filtered, so they shouldn't affect me. 'I would rather cut out bread than beer and, I just love it that much. 'I'm hoping if I can stay off it for the summer, then I might be able to see how it goes!'","Alastair Scott took home allergy test after feeling tired and unwell .

Superfan: Michael Foyle pictured queuing outside the Theatre Royal in Norwich for tickets to see singer Daniel O'Donnell . A Daniel O'Donnell superfan camped outside a theatre for two days to get tickets for his family to see their idol. Grandfather-of-five Michael Doyle queued at the Theatre Royal in Norwich, Norfolk, to make sure he was first in line to get tickets to see the popular Irish singer when his tour arrives there later this year. The 67-year-old traveled down to the city from Lincoln on Wednesday night armed with a flask, comfortable seat, sleeping bag and his Kindle and picked his space on the pavement outside at 1am on Thursday morning ahead of tickets going on sale today. Theatre staff looked after Mr Foyle, providing him with extra food and drink. Mr Foyle said: 'I'm queuing for four tickets - one for myself, one for my wife Sandra, who is the main Daniel O'Donnell fan in the family, my daughter Deborah Brown, 32, and my granddaughter Bethany Jackson, 14. 'My wife has followed Daniel for about 20 years. 'I don't mind doing it. I do it for my family. 'I have had a lot of people coming up to me to ask me what I'm doing, but they have all been nice. 'They thought I was protesting against something. I expected that more people would have joined the queue.' The family has already seen Daniel perform in Nottingham, London, Edinburgh, Bristol, Halifax and Bradford. And Mr Foyle's 57-and-a-half hour queuing stint is not the first time he has camped out for tickets - he queued overnight in Bournemouth last year. John Bultitude, Norwich Theatre Royal spokesman, said: 'The days of people camping out in large numbers and queuing for tickets are becoming more of a thing of the past with the popularity of internet and telephone booking. Popular: Singer Daniel O'Donnell has sold more than 10million records in a career spanning more than 25 years . 'There are still a handful of customers who enjoy the camaraderie and atmosphere of queuing up outside the theatre to be the first to get tickets in their hands. 'They see it as part of the experience when it comes to a popular performer like Daniel O'Donnell.' Affectionately known as 'Wee Daniel', O'Donnell has enjoyed success in Ireland and the UK as well as Australia and the US for a quarter of a century selling more than 10 million albums. He is known for his close relationship with his fanbase and last year became the first artist to have a different album in the UK charts every year for 25 years.","Michael Doyle has camped out in Norwich since Thursday .

Not since Betty Grable became known as the Girl With The Million Dollar Legs has a single aspect of a woman's appearance gripped the world’s attention so completely. The Duchess of Cambridge's hair has become such an obsession it practically needs its own agent to manage the endless stream of speculation about who's cutting it, whether it's been coloured, tonged or blow-dried, and exactly how she manages to keep it so annoyingly swishy. After its slightly tired-looking Poppy Day appearance (never have one woman's grey roots made the front pages of so many newspapers), it came out fighting at a recent charity event, that familiar chestnutty gloss restored, those curls soft and just the right side of tousled. Copy Kate: But where can you get hair just like hers? Question was: who had done it? Step forward . . . half of London's top salons. In hairdressing circles, 'owning' the K. Middy locks is PR gold. Not only does an association with Kate's hair carry huge cachet, it also guarantees a full appointment book. The result has been some less than edifying behaviour, the kind of backbiting, infighting and general Machiavellian plotting more usually found in the corridors of the House of Commons. Only better dressed, obviously. Many can lay legitimate claim to have handled the hallowed follicles. During her engagement and in the run-up to her wedding, she (along with her mother and sister) patronised the Richard Ward salon in Chelsea. Enviable: The Duchess of Cambridge's glossy locks are coveted around the world . James Pryce was her main stylist, and it was he who teased her hair into the soft, romantic half-chignon on the big day. Both Ward and Pryce's stock rocketed; but then, as so often happens when a stylist makes the transition from mere salon employee to a name in their own right, the pair fell out. They went their separate ways - and the divorce has been far from amicable. There have been all kinds of vicious rumours swirling around the internet about Pryce trading on his royal associations, all of which he strenuously denies. Luckily, he has found a new berth at the Josh Wood Atelier, alongside other similarly battle-scarred refugees. George Northwood, formerly a protege of Daniel Hersheson, is there, quietly tending to the likes of Alexa Chung and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley; and Josh himself is a survivor of a fallout, with his old partner at another top Chelsea salon, Real Hair. In fact, the Atelier has become a kind of rebellious refuge for star stylists who've come a-cropper of their former bosses, a place to find top hairdressing talent that’s more interested in hair than in the politics of hair. All the stylists work for themselves, and no one owns anyone - it's a sort of anti-salon, where clients’ privacy is respected and discretion is key. Meanwhile, the battle of the royal barnet rages on, and this time the invader is an Italian called Rossano Ferretti, who claims to have pioneered his own cutting technique - which he calls 'the method' - and who charges £600 a pop for the pleasure of it. It was he, the Ferretti camp claim, who restored Kate's hair to its former glory. But the gossip is that she didn't have her hair cut by Ferretti at all, merely dropped in at a party at the salon. The real heroine is royal court stylist Amanda Cook Tucker, aka Mandy, who has done William and Harry's hair for years, and who also did Diana's.

Health kick: Sarah is trying to drop her bad eating habits with the help of Bodyism . It's very odd. Either there's something other than mint-flavoured chlorophyll in the Bodyism gym water, or I’m beginning to enjoy this. Three weeks in, and I remain stubbornly corpulent (32 per cent fat: I still haven’t quite recovered from that revelation); but I don't FEEL quite so exhausted. There's a spring in my step as I waddle my way through the cigar-scented air of Knightsbridge towards my sessions. Food-wise, things have improved too. I wouldn’t quite describe my diet as clean and lean; but I have introduced a few changes which, for now at least, don't feel too restrictive. The first is breakfast. If I'm on the school run, it's nuts - in more ways than one. There isn't the time or the mental space to successfully deposit two nippers, clothed, fed, watered and in possession of whichever permission slip/item of sports clothing/musical instrument happens to be the order of the day AND fix myself a poached egg and avocado salad with extra-virgin-cold-pressed-super-organic-health-seed oil. So I have nuts instead. Almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts make a fine combination. It’s not very thrilling, I know, but its much better than the children’s breakfast leftovers, and I have to admit, grudgingly, that James Duigan, creator of the Bodyism health and diet system I'm trying to follow, is right: the nuts fill me up and I don't get so hungry/sleepy at lunchtime.

Ryan Gosling won the hearts of women worldwide back in 2004 when he played lovestruck teen Noah in The . Notebook and has kept us enthralled ever since, earning himself a reputation as one of Hollywood's biggest heartthrobs. But one beauty blogger has accused the actor of having a little helping hand in the looks department in the form of a nose job. Hey girl, prepare for a lot of hate mail. Beauty blogger Michelle Villett has accused Gosling of having gone under the knife to . straighten, thin and refine his nose on beauty website Beautyeditor.ca. Surely not? His good looks may have won over the world's females, but one beauty blogger thinks Ryan Gosling has had some help from surgery . Analysing photos of the Canadian taken over the years, Villet observes: 'Do you think his nose is a little thinner, shorter, straighter and less projecting now?'. Comparing photos from his Mickey Mouse club days in the late 90s to shots from 2007, she muses: 'The bridge looks straighter, so it’s . possible that he may have already had the “work” done by this point. Or . had repeat nose jobs.' Using present day photos to illustrate her point, she concludes: 'I say it’s straighter, the tip has been removed and the nostrils have been refined - but we’re talking tiny, tiny. To me, his nose clearly looks quite different compared to the early days.' Has he or hasn't he? Villet uses photos of Gosling back in 2001, aged 21, (L) and compares them to today (R) to ponder over his possible rhinoplasty . So is Villet alone in her thoughts? Celebrity plastic surgeon Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD at 111 Harley Street, said: 'Although subtle, in my opinion, it’s clear from these images that there have been number of changes made to Ryan’s nose. 'Rhinoplasty is one of the most common surgical procedures carried out at my Harley St clinic and during an initial consultation I always advise patients that any alterations to their nose should not only resemble the original but should complement existing facial features. 'Even though my patients have differing concerns, almost all request minor alterations as they don’t want to dramatically change their appearance. This is also evident in Ryan’s images. Comparisons: Blogger Michelle Villet wrote the article on Beauty Editor and used several old and new photos of Gosling to illustrate her point . 'In Ryan’s case, his nose at the beginning of his career is significantly wider at the bridge and has a prominent hump. Fast forward ten years and both of these features appear altered. 'Although rhinoplasty is a relatively simple procedure a result like this will have taken several steps to achieve. 'Firstly, the nasal tip has been slightly rotated upwards and reduced in size by the removal of cartilage. In addition, the bridge has been lowered and made narrower to remove the slight hump, creating a straight, symmetrical look.' Helpless Ryan isn't the only star that Villet has accused of surgery. She has also posted photos of stars such as Emma Watson, Megan Fox and Blake Lively to determine if they’ve also had rhinoplasties, injections or any other procedures.

The Everyday Sexism Project has hit 50,000 entries in just over a year and a half. Laura Bates, 26, from London, founded the anti-sexist initiative in April 2012. It aims to raise awareness of discrimination based on gender. The site made headlines worldwide in May when its hugely successful campaign led to Facebook changing its policy on content endorsing rape and violence against women. The #FBRape initiative highlighted the flaw in the social network’s guidelines which banned hate speech but not offensive remarks regarding sexual assault. The campaign saw several companies pull their advertisements from Facebook, and the website agreed to change its policies. At the time, the Mail reported that the Project had collected over 30,000 women's experiences of gender imbalance in just over a year. 'I see and hear stories every single day . from women whose lives are directly impacted by sexism, misogyny and . sexual abuse,' said Laura. Laura sees the 50,000 records of everyday sexism as a sign there is a lot more to be done. She said: 'It is a testament to the . sheer scale of the problem that we have reached 50,000 entries in such a . short space of time. 'Every woman has a story. Sexism and harassment . have become normalised and accepted, from schoolgirls facing regular . harassment in their uniform to women in the workplace being marginalised . and discriminated against, to female politicians facing open sexism in . the House of Commons. 'Against the backdrop of the media’s constant . portrayal of women as disposable sex objects, we are facing an epidemic . of sexual violence, with over two women per week killed by a current or . former partners, 400,000 women sexually assaulted and over 85,000 raped . every year. 'If the Project has shown anything, it is that gender . inequality is a spectrum, and these things are all connected. #FBRape posted this image on their website, drawing attention to advertisements next to the image . 'The same . ideas and attitudes that underlie ‘minor’ incidents like catcalls, which . we are so often told to ignore, or brush off, are also at the root of . more serious incidents of violence and assault. 'We have to tackle the . normalised acceptance of sexism in the public sphere.' The Project has expanded into 17 different . countries worldwide. Entries have flooded in from women around the . world, as well as men, and have covered the full range of experiences of . gender inequality. From sexual harassment in public spaces to workplace . discrimination, sexual assault and rape, shocking stories have been heard from around the globe. Some 15 new branches are in . the pipeline, in countries including Japan, Mexico, Serbia and India. The . Project has been vocally supported by many male celebrities, including . Simon Pegg and James Corden. It has quickly amassed a dedicated social . media following, with 111,000 Twitter followers, and has led several . successful high-profile campaigns, including the #FBrape campaign of . this Summer. Laura hears stories about sexual harassment in public spaces and workplace discrimination . In the . past few months, the Everyday Sexism Project joined forces with the . British Transport Police on Project Guardian, an initiative that saw . 2000 police officers given special training to crack down on sexual . offences on public transport. Alongside an online awareness campaign led . by Everyday Sexism, Project Guardian has seen an increase of 20 per . cent in reporting of sexual offences on public transport and a 32 per . cent rise in detection of offenders.

An overweight nurse claimed her £10,000 NHS gastric band made her sick, so she had it loosened – only to balloon to nearly her original weight. Faye Attwood, 26, said the band ‘ruined her life’ after she dropped half her bodyweight to 12st, then quickly piled most of it back on. Miss Attwood was once 24st and a size 24 and would gorge on 12 packs of Wotsits and 600g chocolate bars for breakfast. Faye Attwood (right) before her gastric band when her diet consisted of crisps, takeaways and chocolate. At her heaviest, she weighed 24st and was a size 24 . Ms Attwood's trim figure after the £10,000 NHS-funded gastric band op (left) and today (right). She has now gained weight after the band was loosened for medical reasons and she began eating more . She had surgery in December 2010, and lost a dramatic 12st in the next year, going to a size ten. However, she said she spent months in pain, always hungry but unable to keep food down. With . the gastric band in place, her appetite should have decreased . significantly, but Miss Attwood claims that she noticed no difference. In March 2012, doctors slightly loosened the band, which is designed to reduce the size of the stomach and limit food intake. Today, Ms Attwood has yo-yoed back to an unhealthy 20 stone - almost the same weight as she was when she first underwent the operation . She stopped being sick – but started to gain weight, and has now reached 20st. She is also back on virtually the same diet of pizzas and chips. Miss Attwood, of Kings Norton, Birmingham, said people should think twice about gastric bands. She said: ‘It has been a horror story from the start. Dr Ahmed Ahmed, consultant batriatric surgeon at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital told MailOnline that it was 'very rare' for gastric bands to fail in this fashion. He said: 'They are one of the safest operations. Of the 2,100 operations carried out each year, the complication rate is only 0.09 per cent, according to the National Bariatric Surgery Registry.' As well as the silicone plastic ring that is the gastric band, there is also a balloon inside it that determines the tightness - depending on how much liquid is in it. Dr Ahmed said: 'I can only imagine some liquid was taken out of the band to loosen it before gallbladder surgery - although there is no reason for this - and the correct tightness has never been achieved again since.' He added there was no reason why having gallstones or the gallbladder removed should affect the outcome of the surgery. ‘Instead of never feeling hungry, now I never feel full. I would go to a buffet and just eat everything, I would just keep going back.’ The . mental health nurse claims the surgery is not effective and says people . should ‘do things the  natural way by going to the gym and eating the . right foods’. She said: ‘I . want to appeal to everyone not to have a gastric band, even if it is . offered to you for free on the NHS, because it has ruined my life and . could ruin other people’s.’ Miss . Attwood had surgery at Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham after being . diagnosed with gallstones, which could only be removed if she lost . weight. She began eating healthy chicken and vegetables and went to the gym five times a week. But doctors feared the band was not working and tightened it eight times, until she slimmed to 12st by January last year. However, . she claims the weight only came off because the tight band made her . constantly unwell. She said: ‘I couldn’t keep anything down, I was being . sick all the time, it was awful. ‘Every six weeks the band was re-tightened.’ Ms Attwood (before surgery) is now warning others to think twice about having gastric bands fitted. She said 'It has been a horror story from the start and it has ruined by life' In March last year, the band was loosened because she felt so ill – triggering rapid weight gain. ‘Because I had been so deprived of food I suddenly rebelled and literally couldn’t stop eating,’ Miss Attwood said. ‘I started to load back up on fatty cakes and greasy chips and in the end I was eating more than I was before surgery. ‘Before . long my new size ten clothes were way too tight. I realised the gorging . had to stop, but the fatter I got the more I comfort ate. The doctors . said this has happened before but it is rare. I stopped going to the gym . and put all the weight back on and now I weigh 20st.’ Dr . Andy Carson, a Birmingham GP, said: ‘Gastric bands can often be an . effective means of losing weight, but there is much additional work to . be done in terms of counselling to make sure that there is psychological . support in place afterwards. ‘Not being her doctor it is difficult to pinpoint what has gone wrong in this individual case.’","Faye Attwood, 26, weighed 24 stone and was a size 24 before the surgery .

A father-of-two died after suffering brain damage when medics failed to diagnosed and treat his severe ear infection. Rikki Baker, 31, died at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in July 2010. His life could have been saved by a simple course of antibiotics, it was later concluded. Rikki Baker (pictured with his wife, Alicia, and their sons, Eddie and George), 31, died after he developed a severe middle ear infection which was misdiagnosed as a less serious outer ear infection . Mr Baker went to the hospital with his wife, Alicia, on July 24, 2010, suffering from a severe ear ache, vomiting, dizziness, light intolerance and a fever. Instead of being seen by an A&E doctor, he was referred by the receptionist to see a nurse at the  walk in centre on the hospital site. The nurse wrongly diagnosed him as suffering from an infection of the external ear canal and sent him home with ear drops. Had he been seen by an A&E doctor, he would probably have been correctly diagnosed with a more serious middle ear infection. As the infection was not properly treated, it spread from his ear to his brain and caused irreversible damage. After leaving the walk in centre, Mr Baker’s condition deteriorated further and he was drifting in and out of consciousness. His wife called an out of hours GP service and NHS Direct but was not instructed to take him back to hospital. On July 26 he suffered a fit at the family home in Exeter and was rushed to hospital by ambulance. Mr Baker went to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital suffering from an ear ache, vomiting, dizziness and a fever. Rather than being seen by an A&E doctor, he was sent to the walk in centre on the hospital site to see a nurse who misdiagnosed him meaning he didn't get the life-saving treatment he needed . At this point he was finally diagnosed with an infection of the middle ear and underwent an operation to remove the infected bone and tissue. However, the treatment came too late and he died on July 30 of brain damage and swelling caused by blood poisoning as a result of an acute infection of the middle ear. Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust admitted that had Mr Baker been seen by a doctor on July 24, it would have resulted in him being given antibiotics, which would have treated his ear infection and prevented his death. Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust has now agreed to pay an out-of-court settlement to the family for the failings in Mr Baker’s care. Mrs Baker, 33, mother to the couple’s . two children, now aged eight and seven, said: ‘Rikki was taken from us . and he should never have died. He will miss watching George and Eddie . grow up and we will always wish he was still here with us. ‘Knowing . Rikki would have survived and been fine if he was given the correct . treatment makes it even harder to come to terms with, but I am at least . thankful the Trust has finally admitted it was their fault, it's a . little bit of justice for Rikki. ‘Despite . this, since Rikki’s death, we have never once had an apology from the . Trust which leaves me questioning whether improvements have been made . and whether they are serious about improving patient safety. Mr Baker would probably have survived if he had been correctly diagnosed and given antibiotics sooner . ‘I don’t think it’s a lot to ask for given I have lost my husband and two little boys have lost their dad. ‘I . need to know that changes have been put into place to ensure this won't . happen again to another family. People deserve a thorough examination . by an appropriate medical professional, and this should be common . practice.’ Following an inquest into Mr Baker’s death at the end of 2011, a coroner recorded a narrative verdict, saying that although he had died of a middle ear infection - a natural cause - there was evidence that vital signs had been missed which lead to a misdiagnosis. Deputy Coroner Darren Salter went on to . ask for a review of procedures relating to the treatment of ear . infections at the walk in centre on the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital site. Luke Trevorrow, a medical law expert . at Irwin Mitchell’s Bristol office, said: ‘This is a truly tragic case . that has left two little boys without a father and Alicia shocked and . devastated by the sudden loss of her husband. ‘It . is obviously very difficult for the family to come to terms with the . fact that had Rikki been referred to a doctor and given a simple course . of antibiotics to treat the ear infection, he would in all likelihood . still be alive today. Mr Baker died at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital of brain damage and swelling caused by blood poisoning as a result of an acute infection of the middle ear . ‘Instead, . the family now have to live with knowing that more could have been done . to prevent Rikki’s death and obviously no settlement can make up for . that. ‘We believe that . diagnosis of ear infections can be difficult even for experienced . doctors and it should not therefore be a diagnosis that nurses are asked . to make without assistance. We do not believe that they should be put . in that position. ‘We . are keen to see confirmation from the Trust about what training and . procedures have been implemented to ensure the same errors cannot be . made again and protect patient safety.’ Dr Alison Diamond, medical director at Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust which runs the walk in clinic, said: 'We would like to extend our apologies and condolences to Mrs Baker and her family. 'The Trust took over management of the walk in centre in April 2011. We carried out a thorough review to understand the circumstances surrounding this tragic event and ensure that any learning for the service and its staff was quickly identified and implemented. 'These included tightening protocols around the assessment and treatment of otitis media and otitis externa [ear infections], providing additional staff training around ear infections and working to ensure all consultation notes are comprehensive and detailed. 'The Trust apologises unreservedly for the failings identified in Mr Baker’s care.'","Rikki Baker went to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital on July 24, 2010, with a severe ear ache, vomiting, dizziness, light intolerance and a fever .

A ‘historic agreement’ designed to save the Dead Sea has been signed to link its dwindling body of water with the Red Sea using a 112 mile (180km) pipeline. The deal, named the Red-Dead Conduit, has been considered for years, but has finally been signed by The Palestinian Authority, Jordan and Israel at the World Bank in Washington. The massive infrastructure project will see 200million cubic metres of water pumped from a desalination plant every year, which would be located at the mouth of the Red Sea in Jordan. Israeli Regional Development Minister Sylvan Shalom (left), Jordanian Water and Agriculture Minister Hazem Nasser (centre) and Shaddad Attili, head of the Palestinian Water Authority, pose after signing an agreement to construct a Red Sea-Dead Sea pipeline to carry water north and slow down the desiccation of the Dead Sea . While some of the water is set to be shared between Jordan, Israel and the West Bank, brine will be pumped to the Dead Sea in a bid to stop it drying up. Water levels in the Dead Sea, which straddles Israel and Jordan, have fallen by 82 feet over 50 years and experts have predicted that it could dry up completely by 2050 if action is not taken. The agreement brings a long-awaited Red Sea-Dead Sea pipeline one step closer to completion. The idea of linking the two bodies of water has existed for more than a century and in modern times, the deal aims to set up a water sharing scheme between the three nations, as well as preserve the popular tourist destination. Israel’s energy and regional development minister, Silvan Shalom, said the deal came about due to ‘strategic cooperation of diplomatic significance between Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority.’ He told Israeli Radio: ‘This is a breakthrough after many years of efforts. It is nothing less than a historic move,’ The Telegraph reported. Under the plans, a desalination plant will be built in the southern Jordanian port of Aqaba on the Red Sea and will desalinate water to be shared by the neighbours .

The brine by-product will be sent north in the pipeline to the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea has been found to be receding at a rate of more than 3ft (one metre) every year. Under the agreement, Israel plans to release more water from the Sea of Galilee - its largest reservoir - to Jordan, and sell desalinated water to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinians have long complained about Israeli restrictions on constructing new water infrastructure, which they say exacerbate water shortages. Yesterday ministers from the three governments gathered at the Washington headquarters of the World Bank, which plans to help them implement the projects.

Palestinians have long complained about Israeli restrictions on constructing new water infrastructure, which they say exacerbate water shortages. The World Bank did not say how much the project would cost or who would pay for it, but according to the BBC, it could be in the region of between $250m and $400m (£152m and £244m). ‘I am pleased that the long-term engagement of the World Bank has facilitated this next step by the three governments, which will enhance water availability and facilitate the development of new water through desalination,’ Inger Andersen, the World Bank's Vice President for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. The World Bank did not say how much the project would cost or who would pay for it, but according to the BBC, it could be in the region of between $250m and $400m (£152m and £244m). The agreement was reached after the organisation determined in January that it is possible to use the Red Sea to replenish the shrinking Dead Sea after years of studying whether such a connecting lifeline could work. The World Bank said the current phase of the agreement was designed to provide new water to a region critically short of it. However, environmental groups have long warned of the adverse effects of a pipeline, such as the possibility of new algae and mineral-deposits changing the colour of the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea, technically a lake, is a tourist spot famous for its salty waters that allow bathers to float. Its mineral-rich mud, used for skin treatment, is sold around the world. As the population has increased in the region, water has been diverted from the Jordan river, the Dead Sea's natural water source, for drinking and agriculture. The shoreline has shrunk, leaving a beach full of dangerous sink holes (pictured) As the population has increased in the region, water has been diverted from the Jordan river, the Dead Sea's natural water source, for drinking and agriculture. The shoreline has shrunk at an accelerating pace, leaving behind a rocky, desert beach full of dangerous sink holes, which have been exasperated by factories extracting minerals from the lake. The agreement includes a water trading arrangement, under which Israel will receive 30-50 million cubic metres of water to use in the resort city of Eilat and the Arava region. Under the plans, a desalination plant will be built in the southern Jordanian port of Aqaba (pictured) on the Red Sea and will desalinate water to be shared by the neighbours. The salty by-product, known as brine, will be sent north in a 112mile (180km) pipeline to the Dead Sea . Jordan will receive 30 million cubic metres of water for use in the south of the country and another 50 million from Israel's Lake Kinneret, also known as the Sea of Galilee, bordering the Golan Heights. The Palestinian Authority will also receive water from Lake Kinneret to improve supplies in the West Bank. Friends of the Earth have accused Mr Shalom of ‘misleading the Israeli public’ by selling the pipeline project as a way of saving the Dead Sea. ‘What is being devised here is nothing to do with the Red-Dead Canal project but is a water exchange programme,’ Gidon Bromberg, Israeli director of EcoPeace/Friends of the Earth Middle East, told The Telegraph. ‘The link to the Dead Sea that's being proposed here threatens the viability of the project from an environmental and economic perspective. It will bring foreign water into the Dead Sea that would upset its ecosystem, creating Gypum and quite probably algae.’","The Red-Dead Conduit has been signed by The Palestinian Authority, Jordan and Israel at the World Bank in Washington .

Samsung has reportedly attempted to silence a customer whose Galaxy S4 smartphone dangerously caught fire.

Earlier this month, Youtube user GhostlyRich posted a video that showed the damage caused to his Samsung Galaxy S4 handset after it caught fire while charging. Scroll down for videos... Samsung has attempted to silence a customer whose Galaxy S4 smartphone dangerously caught fire . ‘The other night we plugged it in, and we like, were letting it charge - literally nothing different,’ he said. ‘And then the smell of smoke, fire and destruction.’ ‘Thank God the battery didn’t go', he added. ‘Anyone who knows these batteries will know, when they blow, they expand and just explode. And when they do it's just molten fire.’ Although the battery did not explode, GhostlyRich’s phone was destroyed and so he contacted Samsung for a replacement.

The former test pilot from Chichester, West Sussex, has no fears about launching into space from Kazakhstan in a Russian Soyuz rocket in November 2015 – because it’s much less dangerous than his old job. He said: ‘I think my future career is probably far safer than my past career. I’ve carried out some fairly high-risk flight tests.

A Conservative website has been caught out using pictures of young models to promote its recruitment campaign for the next general election instead of real Tory activists. Voters logging on to a website designed to attract younger supporters might have expected to see people who were actually Tories. But instead they were greeted by a large stock photograph which has also been used to promote universities in Australia.

The Team 2015 campaign is led by party chairman Grant Shapps, who has previously come under fire for using a pseudonym to promote his own internet business. The pictures of smiling young people appears under the 'Make It Happen' slogan, alongside a message from Mr Shapps. But the use of the stock image on the website, revealed in today's Daily Mirror, came to light when the same photograph was spotted on a website Down Under. Last year it emerged a ’hard working family’ used in Tory adverts had also been pictured promoting insurance brokers, builders and dentists. On the latest website, Mr Shapps writes underneath the banner: 'We need to mobilise our hard working volunteers to ensure that we can deliver on the ground. 'That is why we are looking to recruit for Team 2015 so we can deploy our best troops to where they are needed most.' But the ’hard-working volunteers’ are all models posing for stock picture libraries available to newspapers, magazines and websites around the world. Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher told the Mirror: 'Once again the Conservatives are taking people for fools. After the infamous airbrushed posters of David Cameron, this is just the latest example that proves that their desperate attempt to look young, diverse and in touch with modern Britain is a complete deception and a sham.'

Now Sadie is finally being treated and has been able to stay awake long enough to form a happy relationship with partner Nick Threadgold. Diagnosis at last: After 20 years of suffering, Sadie, 39, was finally told she had narcolepsy . Nick, 39, was understanding after her diagnosis earlier this year and the pair's relationship has gone from strength to strength. Sadie said: 'Since I've started my medication we've been able to talk in the car, before I would just fall straight to sleep. 'Before he was always so bored, waiting for me to wake up, but now we can finally spend quality time together.' 'I couldn't even take a bath, as I could have fallen asleep and drowned' Nick said: 'Now that Sadie is on medication it has greatly improved our relationship. 'She is able to keep going during the day and we can actually have conversations when she's comfortable as normally she'd be straight asleep.' She's been known to snooze next to club speakers, in taxis, at the bus stop and even in shops. Sadie said: 'I was doing a computer course at college but I had to quit because I would always fall asleep and it was really embarrassing. New love: Nick, 39, was understanding and after her diagnosis, the pair's relationship has gone from strength to strength . 'I hadn't been diagnosed with narcolepsy so people didn't really have much sympathy.' Sadie, who would fall to sleep up to four times a day and for up to two hours a time never let her â€˜unknown' condition control her future. She said: 'I had always wanted to become a hairdresser and despite falling asleep all the time I was determined to not let it dominate my life. Now I've been diagnosed with narcolepsy I can start doing more with my children during the day without always falling asleep . 'I was cutting someone's hair one day and completely fell asleep while standing. 'It was embarrassing really as people would just resume I was really lazy. 'I couldn't even take a bath, as I could easily have fallen asleep and drowned.' But this year Sadie finally found the answers she was looking for following a sleep study and lumbar puncture (a medical procedure where a needle is inserted into the lower part of the spine, in order to look for evidence of conditions affecting the brain). She said: 'I just don't understand why it took so long to diagnose Narcolepsy when I knew myself I had it for 20-years and I'm not a doctor.' One of Sadie's friends who were diagnosed decades before her would often comment on how her sleeping pattern was similar to that of herself. Moving on with their lives: Sadie finally found the answers she was looking for following a sleep study and lumbar puncture . Sadie's final diagnosis was given this year after a 20-year wait. Sadie said: 'Now I've been diagnosed with narcolepsy I can start doing more with my children during the day without always falling asleep. I can finally look forward to sleep-free days.' The condition is a rare sleep disorder affecting around 31,000 people in the UK. Nicola Rule, Treasurer of Narcolepsy UK said: 'So few people know about this medical condition, it is a very complex and chronic illness that won't disappear. 'So many narcolepsy sufferers wait a long time to be diagnosed as many GPs are not fully aware of this neurological condition. 'Our charity aims to raise more awareness so people can be diagnosed quicker.'","Sadie Jones, 39, from Devon, has narcolepsy .

Our brains are wired to detect and process grammatical errors automatically without us even realising it, according to research from the University of Oregon. Previous studies concluded that our brains behave this way, yet neuroscientists from Oregon now have the evidence to back these claims up. During a study of English speakers aged between 18 and 30, the scientists used  electroencephalography (EEG) to record changes in brain activity during an event, which in this case were short sentences presented visually one word at a time. During the grammatical error study at the University of Oregon, researchers tested how the participants' brains responded to sentences that were either grammatically correct, or contained a grammatical error. They recorded these changes in brain activity using EEG sensors, pictured . Electroencephalography (EEG) is the method of recording electrical activity using sensors placed on the scalp. A brain's electrical charge is maintained by billions of neurons. These neurons are electrically charged by proteins that send ions across their membranes. Ions of similar charge repel each other. As ions push away from each other they create a wave, like the one pictured. This process is known as volume conduction. When the wave of ions reaches the electrodes on the scalp, they can push or pull electrons on the metal. Since metal conducts the push and pull of electrons easily, the difference in push or pull voltages between any two electrodes can be measured by a voltmeter. Recording these voltages over time gives us the EEG. This change in brain signals is known as the Event-Related Potential (ERP). Participants were given 280 experimental sentences, including some that were syntactically, grammatically, correct and others containing grammatical errors. For example, 'We drank Lisa's brandy by the fire in the lobby'  and 'We drank Lisa's by brandy the fire in the lobby.' A 50 millisecond audio tone was also played at some point in each sentence. This could be before or after a grammatical error, or at a random point during a grammatically correct sentence. According to lead researcher Laura Batterink, this method could show whether awareness was at work during the brain's processing of the errors. 'Participants had to respond to the tone as quickly as they could, indicating if its pitch was low, medium or high.' Batterink said. 'The grammatical violations were fully visible to participants, but because they had to complete this extra task, they were often not consciously aware of the violations. Laura Batterink is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oregon. She recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) as study participants were given sentences containing grammatical errors. In the majority of cases, the participants processed the errors without even realising it . 'They would read the sentence and have to indicate if it was correct or incorrect. 'If the tone was played immediately . before the grammatical violation, they were more likely to say the . sentence was correct even it wasn't.' When tones appeared after grammatical errors, subjects detected 89% of the errors. In cases where subjects correctly declared errors in sentences, the researchers found a P600 effect. The P600 effect is an ERP response in which the error is recognised and corrected automatically in order to make sense of the sentence. When the tones appeared before the grammatical errors, subjects detected only 51% of them. Co-author Helen J. Neville said that when the tone was played before the event it created a blink in the participant's attention. The key to conscious awareness, Neville continued, is based on whether or not a person can declare an error. And the tones disrupted participants' ability to do this. However, even when the participants did not notice these errors, their brains responded to them, generating an early negative ERP response. These undetected errors also delayed participants' reaction times to the tones. Batterink said: 'Even when you don't pick up on a syntactic error your brain is still picking up on it. 'There is a brain mechanism recognising it and reacting to it, processing it unconsciously so you understand it properly. Helen Neville, who co-authored the University of Oregon study looking into how our brains respond to grammatical errors, said that teaching strategies should be changed in light of the results. She added that children pick up grammar rules implicitly through daily interactions with parents or peers. Neville thinks that adults should be taught grammar in a similar way when learning a second language, to make the process easier . 'While other aspects of language, such as semantics and phonology, can also be processed implicitly, the present data represent the first direct evidence that implicit mechanisms also play a role in the processing of syntax, the core computational component of language.' Neville said that the results mean it may be time to reconsider teaching strategies, especially how adults are taught a second language. Children, she noted, often pick up grammar rules implicitly through routine daily interactions with parents or peers, simply hearing and processing new words and their usage before any formal instruction. She likened such learning to 'Jabberwocky' - the nonsense poem introduced by Lewis Carroll in 1871 in 'Through the Looking Glass,'. During this scene, Alice discovers a book in an unrecognisable language that turns out to be written inversely and readable in a mirror. For adults learning a second language, Neville said: 'Teach grammatical rules implicitly, without any semantics at all, like with jabberwocky. Get them to listen to jabberwocky, like a child does.' The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders of the National Institutes of Health supported the research and the study was published in the May 8 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience.","Researchers from the University of Oregon recorded how the signals in our brains react to grammatical errors .

Back in the game: 17-year-old Erin Cox played her first volleyball game since being suspended for trying to give a drunken friend a ride home from a party . Erin Cox, 17, played her first volleyball game last night since being benched for five games and stripped of her title as team captain for trying to give a drunken friend a ride home. Erin's return to the court was triumphant, contributing 16 assists in North Andover High School's the 3-0 victory over Billerica. But her parent's legal battle against the school district for the harsh discipline of their daughter is ongoing. It was earlier reported that a police officer actually vouched for Erin's sobriety at the party, but that school administrators decided to punish Erin anyway because of a zero tolerance for underage drinking. As Erin's parents attempt to sue the school in federal court, their lawyer Wendy Murphy released the content of that email to the North Andover Citizen. In the email, Officer Brian Neeley of the Boxford Police describes breaking up the party and speaking with Erin while she waited for her mother to arrive. 'Erin did not have the slightest odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from her person,' he wrote. 'She was polite, articulate, steady on her feet, and very remorseful for her decision to go into the residence but was only helping out a friend that had called her for a ride.' Earlier that night, Erin was finishing up her shift at a local restaurant when she got a text message from a friend asking her to pick her up at a party because she was too drunk to drive home. Shortly after arriving at the house to help her friend, police arrived and cited the 15 North Andover students inside. Despite Officer Neeley's vouch for her innocence, the school suspended Erin from volleyball for five games and took away her title of team captain. No excuse: One of the police officers who broke up the party sent an email to school administrators, vouching for Erin's sobriety but that didn't stop them from punishing her. Above, Erin (#12) with her North Andover team . This prompted Erin's outraged parents to file a lawsuit against the school. While a state judge ruled that he didn't have jurisdiction in the case, the Cox family are continuing to seek legal damages from the school through federal court. The lawsuit has made Erin's story national news, and many are blaming the school for seemingly discouraging students from being sober drivers. The Boston Globe published an editorial today, condemning the school administration's behavior. 'North Andover - and all other communities - should make clear that sober students who provide rides for intoxicated friends won't be subject to punishment,' the editorial board wrote. 'The toll of drunken driving is simply too high to discourage this form of safe transportation.' But so far, the school administration has defended their position. Right and wrong: So far, the school has refused to back down on their decision to punish Erin . 'While some may decry the Administration's actions as unfair or inconsistent with the principles of due process, our Administration wholeheartedly disagrees,' Superintendent Kevin Hutchinson told FoxNews.com. 'To be clear, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that participation in interscholastic athletics is a privilege. Rather than simply revoking the privilege, our Administration has consistently afforded its student-athletes a reasonable opportunity to be heard before a disciplinary decision is made,' Hutchinson said. However, the administration's decision to punish Erin may have consequences far beyond the walls of North Andover. Her parents are worried the suspension may have impact on Erin's ability to play volleyball in college. Legal action: Erin's parents are in the middle of trying to sue the school through the federal courts . 'They aren't sure and have gotten mixed answers,' Ms Murphy said. While Erin told the Boston Herald on Sunday that she felt 'defeated' for trying to do the right thing - she also said she would still make the same decision if she could do it all over. But Erin is being rewarded for her good deed - just not through the school. 33-year-old Matt Holland, a one-time high school athlete himself, started 'The Erin Cox Fund' on the web site GoFundMe.com. Mr Holland's original goal was to raise $1,000 in a scholarship fund for Erin, but it seems the fund got more donations than he expected and was more recently changed to $6,500. As over Saturday morning, Erin's scholarship fund had gathered $5,875.","Erin Cox, 17, was demoted from team captain and benched for five volleyball games after being caught at an underage drinking party .

Elle magazine has come under fire from fashion commentators this week for 'covering up' Melissa McCarthy's curves on its November cover. The Bridesmaids actress, who is one of six stars to front the glossy title for its celebration of Women in Hollywood, is seen in a coat and dress by plus-size label Marina Rinaldi in the almost full-length photo, which cuts off mid-calf. But for critics, the cover was received with disbelief and disappointment. Under fire: Elle magazine has been accused of 'covering up' the curves of Bridesmaids star Melissa McCarthy on its November cover . The writers of fashion blog Go Fug Yourself were among the most vocal. They wrote: 'I kind of can't believe they put the plus-size . actress on their cover BURIED INSIDE A GIANT COAT.' And former model Cynthia Bailey told GMA that 'times have changed. Fashion has . changed. . . I . just immediately thought, ""What a missed opportunity to represent all . the curvy girls of the world.' Slate writer June Thomas called McCarthy the magazine's 'token plus-size cover girl' and noted that the only visible flesh is a . tiny triangle between the coat’s lapels and the briefest glimpse of . calf.' She mused that 'perhaps photographer Thomas Whiteside only knows how to photograph . the usual stick insect models, because he clearly has no clue how to . highlight McCarthy’s curves.' 'On all our shoots, stylists work . with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in, and this is no . different: Melissa loved this look' And Bustle argued that 'it’s . hard to see this as a victory [for plus-size women].' Celebrity psychotherapist Stacy Kaiser told FOX411 that the styling is 'sending the psychological message that . hiding is what full-figured women should do. Melissa is beautiful, . talented and popular – her beauty should be flaunted not covered. This shows that the . fashion world is trying to strike the balance between featuring . full-figured women, while still hiding them as well.' Elle defended its cover stating that . they are careful to choose looks that the subjects feel good in, and . that McCarthy was delighted with the outcome. Winter fashion: The Bridesmaids actress, who is one of six stars to be celebrated by the glossy title for its Women in Hollywood issue, is seen in a coat and dress by plus-size label Marina Rinaldi . In a statement issued to MailOnline, a spokesperson said: 'On all of our shoots, our stylists work . with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in, and this is no . different: Melissa loved this look, and is gorgeous on our cover. We . are thrilled to honor her as one of our Women in Hollywood this year.' And indeed they have plenty of support in their positive opinion of the cover. After all, the magazine did not shy away from featuring her body entirely, as it did when it featured Gabourey Sidibe last year, or as Vogue UK did with its Adele cover. As a plus-size brand, it is rare to see Marina Rinaldi featured on a mainstream fashion magazine cover at all. And a coat is an appropriate choice of attire for a winter issue, just as new season stock is hitting stores. Hollywood hit: Ms McCarthy pictured in the 2011 comedy Bridesmaids, in which she co-starred with Wendi Mclendon-Covey, Rose Byrne, Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph . Critics have also failed to question whether it was partly Ms McCarthy's choice to be dressed in a coat. Perhaps, at 43, she is not comfortable in a clingy dress. This question, of course, can only be answered by Ms McCarthy herself, who has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment, but the shoot won effusive praise from The Curvy Fashionista blogger Marie Denee. 'We wanted to see her fashion forward, playful, and celebratory of her shape- well HELLO! Talk about giving it her all,' she wrote. 'I cannot tell you how hyped of this cover I am! SCORE for Elle Magazine delivering to us a shoot and fashion cover that we can be QUITE proud of!' Jezebel, too, had nothing but praise, calling Ms McCarthy 'absolutely gorgeous and glamorous' and taking issue with the critique. What's more, plus-size stars' covers sell. British Vogue said its Adele cover in 2011 was one of its best selling that year, and according to a poll on Go Fug Yourself, Ms McCarthy's cover was the most popular of the six released by Elle for its November 2013 issue.","The Bridesmaids star is one of .

Selfridges has reported aN increase in sales of insect delicacies after the World Health Organisation suggested that eating bugs could be the solution to worldwide food shortages. The department store has recorded an 11 per cent increase in sales of Edible's insect-based snacks including Thai Green Curry Crickets, Dark Chocolate Covered Scorpions and BBQ Flavour Worm Crisps. According to the WHO, insects are a more sustainable protein source than other meats. Selfridges has noticed a surge in demand for insect delicacies after the World Health Organisation claimed that eating bugs could help solve worldwide food shortages . The UN's Food and Agricultural Agency says that more than two billion people - 30 per cent of the planet's population - already supplement their diet with insects. A 200-page report, released at a news conference at the U.N. agency's Rome headquarters, says 2 billion people worldwide already supplement their diets with insects, which are high in protein and minerals, and have environmental benefits. Commenting on the increase in sales, Emma Murphy, Selfridges Confectionery . Buyer said: 'The Edible range has a broad appeal and there are a number . of customers who appreciate the high protein levels in the range as it . offers an alternative to high protein diets. 'The . Mopain Ants have as much protein per gram as a breast of chicken. Around Christmas time, we find customers buy  the range for novelty . value. 'The Scorpion . vodka, The Gold Lolly and the Mopain worms do really well over Christmas . especially as 'I'm a Celebrity' is on at that time, too.' Insects are 'extremely efficient' in converting feed into edible meat, according to the WHO report. On average, they can convert 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of feed into 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of insect mass. In comparison, cattle require 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of feed to produce a kilo of meat. Insects are full of protein, fibre and a range of micronutrients . Currently, most edible insects are gathered in forests and what insect farming does take place is often family-run and serves niche markets. But the U.N. says mechanisation can ratchet up insect farming production. The fish bait industry, for example, has long farmed insects. Insect farming is 'one of the many ways to address food and feed security,' the food agency said. 'Insects are everywhere and they reproduce quickly,' the agency said, adding they leave a 'low environmental footprint.' They provide high-quality protein and nutrients when compared with meat and fish and are 'particularly important as a food supplement for undernourished children,' it said. Insects can also be rich in copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, selenium and zinc, and are a source of fibre. The agency noted that its Edible Insect Program is also examining the potential of arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, although they are not strictly speaking insects. University biologists have analysed the nutritional value of edible insects, and some of them, such as certain beetles, ants, crickets and grasshoppers, come close to lean red meat or broiled fish in terms of protein per gram. Worm Salt; £7.99 . Infused with chilli and agave worm, the salt has an intense smoky flavour, traditionally used in southern Mexico as a seasoning for salsas.

McClain, who was in jail for a misdemeanor charge, died from his injuries 13 days after the incident on June 4. On Thursday a jury found the prison officer guilty after viewing the security camera footage of the incident. In it, Council is seen pushing McClain away before grabbing him and throwing him to the ground twice. Council told the court that on the night of the incident he was the only officer in a block of 55 prisoners. He said McClain became confrontational and other prisoners were egging him on. 'I’m telling him that he needs to back . up. Again, I’m telling him don’t let his friends . get him in trouble. You could hear these guys saying something to him,' Council told the court.

Police investigating the Sunday death of a college freshman found drugs and torture documents in the rural Pennsylvania home where the hazing occurred. Chun 'Michael' Deng, 19, died after a brutal hazing incident left him brain dead last weekend, but police investigating the death found even more damning evidence inside the remote home where Mr Deng met his fate. Investigators discovered hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, paddles and a photocopy of pages from a book about torture, according to an affidavit cited by multiple media outlets. Police believe Mr Deng was injured during a hazing ritual called the 'Glass Ceiling,' where people . are blindfolded and made to carry 20 pounds of sand in a back while members of Pi Delta Psi repeatedly tackled him. Mr Deng was tackled one too many times, he lied in the snow unresponsive after being knocked unconscious after hitting his head. Fraternity brothers are believed to have carried him inside where they set him down and changed his clothes as others looked up his symptoms on the internet, police said. Deng was reported to be unconscious . and unresponsive immediately after he fell... Deng was then carried inside and placed by a fire and continued to be unresponsive,' said the affidavit. 'Deng was then carried inside and placed by a fire and continued to be unresponsive.' They did not take Mr Deng to a hospital for more than an hour, and when the group finally arrived at the hospital he was declared brain dead. Mr Deng, died from head injuries on Monday, after three fellow students took him to the hospital at about 6.40am on Sunday. He had been knocked unconscious around 5am Sunday morning. Quick to realize they had a problem on their hands, brothers from Baruch frantically removed . fraternity-related items from the Pennsylvania home, police said.

Fraternity ritual: Police are investigating how an NYC student died over the weekend in Pennsylvania . A Pennsylvania prosecutor has said charges in the case are expected once the police investigation ends.

'As . a result of this incident, we are immediately suspending all new member . education nationwide until further notice,' national president Andy . Meng said in a statement. The . Monroe County District Attorney's office said the 19-year-old was injured at a Tunkhannock Township residence, . where about 30 members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity had traveled for . the weekend. The township is in northeastern Pennsylvania, about 100 miles west of New York City. Mr Deng, a freshman at Baruch College, was one of four students pledging to the fraternity in the hazing ritual, the practice of humiliating and torturing newcomers as part of their fraternity initiation. Pocono . Mountain Regional Police Chief Harry Lewis told NBC News that the . pledges were told they had to get from one point to another while . blindfolded. Mr Deng never saw it coming. Local authorities have pledged to charge anyone involved in the blindfolded teen's death, and that there may be dozens of charges, according to reports. The sheer volume of charges is such that they are likely be announced next week at the earliest, officials said. Baruch College announced late Friday that the fraternity has been suspended from campus, an internal review and the results of the criminal investigation will determine which disciplinary action the school takes against individuals.

'Fortunate to be alive': Rebecca Johnson was left with rhabdomyolysis after spending just one hour in the gym with a personal trainer . When Rebecca Johnson started to struggle during her first session with a personal trainer at her local gym, she pushed herself to persevere, thinking ‘no pain, no gain’. Just hours later the 30-year-old was rushed to hospital suffering from severe muscle damage brought on by exercising too hard. Doctors told her that she was suffering from rhabdomyolysis, a rare condition which could have caused her kidneys to fail if left untreated. She spent four days in hospital on a drip and has been unable to return to work as a goldsmith since the session last month because her arms are still too weak. Now Miss Johnson wants to warn others about the perils of over-exercising, which could prove life-threatening even with the support of a professional. Miss Johnson, who runs regularly, paid £40 for an hour-long session at the LA Fitness gym near her home in Brighton. She said: ‘I did pull-ups, weights, bench press-ups and found it incredibly hard going. ‘A few times I said to the personal trainer I was finding it tough and I didn’t know if I could carry on. 'But he encouraged me to dig deep to do the best possible. As he was the professional, I did as he asked. I thought no pain, no gain.’ ‘And although my arms felt like jelly at the end of it, I reassured myself that was just the result of a healthy workout.' When she woke the next day, Miss Johnson could barely move. ‘I was in such agony I couldn’t straighten my arms. 'It was difficult to work - I make jewellery for a living but my arms were so painful it was impossible to hold the tools.' At 3pm she went to the toilet and noticed her urine was tea coloured. ‘I now know this is a classic sign of rhabdomyolysis because it was full of blood,’ she says, ‘but then I just thought I must be dehydrated and drank more water.' By the evening Miss Johnson’s arms had started to swell so she arranged to see an out-of-hours doctor. The 30-year-old was admitted to hospital after an out-of-hours doctor took 'one look' at her arms. She was placed on a drip for four days . ‘He took one look at my arms, and after testing my urine said I needed to go to hospital straight away,’ she said. Rhabdomyolysis is triggered when muscles start to break down during strenuous exercise, resulting in a toxic fluid leaking into the body which can cause the kidneys to fail. The condition often occurs in people injured in disasters such as earthquakes or bombings but is also caused by strenuous exercise and can occur in professional athletes who overdo it. It occurs when the muscles are damaged resulting in the muscle protein myoglobin leaking into the urine. A keen runner, Rebecca spent £40 on her one-hour session with the personal trainer at LA Fitness in Brighton . The 30-year-old said she feels 'very fortunate to be alive' after the ordeal . The toxic leaking fluid, which should . never be in the blood, can damage the kidneys, which desperately try to . filter it out or cause the heart to beat irregularly causing a cardiac . arrest. Treatment involves being put on a drip to flush out the toxins. Rebecca wants to warn others of the dangers of overdoing it at the gym . ‘When . the doctors explained it can lead to potentially life threatening . kidney failure, I realised how lucky I was I sought help when I did. I . now feel incredibly fortunate to be alive.’ Miss Johnson said: ‘I was stunned when they said that one hour’s exercise had caused it.’ Three weeks later her arms are still weak and she has been told it could be a month before full feeling returns. She has complained to LA Fitness, saying trainers should be taught about the risk of pushing people to do too much too soon. She added: ‘I don’t personally blame the trainer. I just don’t think any of them know about this condition.’ ‘I can imagine lots of people are joining gyms to shape up to Christmas and want to warn them of the dangers.’ A spokesman for LA Fitness said: ‘We take the health and well-being of our customers very seriously and we’re really sorry that this happened to Rebecca. ‘All our personal trainers are fully qualified. We understand that this particular condition is incredibly rare and cannot be pre-screened for. ‘However, given the experience at Brighton we have advised our teams to ensure they are fully aware of this.’","Rebecca Johnson spent one hour in gym with a personal trainer .

Response: Emergency services reacted to the rockslide, but soon had to retreat due to unsafe conditions overhead . He told the Deseret News that the couple, like everyone in the town, was aware of the dangers of rock slides. 'It's . just one of those things everybody always talks about but never . imagines will ever happen, have two people killed,' he said. 'Through . conversation with other people, [Elsey and Morris] actually said, ""If . the rocks want to take me, let it happen."" So that was the attitude they . had, that most people have,' the mayor said. 'We live in a dangerous . area. On one side of the highway is the river, and we get floods. And on . the other side is the mountain.' When . emergency services arrived at the scene, shortly after 5pm Thursday, . they found the splintered remains of the home buried under the weight of . the gigantic boulder which stood at a height of around 15 feet. The town is located on the main highway through Zion National Park, NBC station KSL in Salt Lake City reported. Mayor McGuire, told local press that the earth close to the road . gave way causing a landslide which carried tons of soil and rocks on to . the home at the bottom of a steep incline. He added that the cause of the fall is being treated as natural with no human activity being blamed for triggering the slide. McGuire said the house 'just flattened out' when the debris hit, confirming that nobody in the house has survived. As it was: The two storey house had concrete foundations with a wooden upper tier which was smashed by the boulder . Devastation: Two people were inside the house which was at the bottom of a steep incline close to one of the area's major highways . Recovery: Emergency crews began working at the scene but were forced to call off their search due to the risk of further falling debris .

It may look a little more modest than some modern-day festive displays, but these black and white photographs give a charming insight into the way Christmas was celebrated in London through the 1950s, 60s and 70s. This unique collection offers a glimpse into the festive season around Regent Street, St Paul's Cathedral, Trafalgar Square and other areas of the capital. The shots were taken by freelance photographer Henry Grant over a period of 30 years and bought, alongside around 80,000 others, by the Museum of London in the 1980s. The photograph shows Regent Street, central London, in 1954, a part of Henry Grant's collection . Not much has changed: Regent Street hasn't transformed itself a great deal in the last 60 years . Trafalgar Square had this Christmas tree, a gift from Norway, situated in front of the National Gallery in 1958 . The Trafalgar Square tree, shown here in 1955, has been a gift to London from Oslo, Norway, since 1947 . Trafalgar Square has retained its festive look into the 21st century (2005 tree pictured) The collection, which was released today by the museum, includes a picture of a busy Regent Street at night in 1954, complete with old-fashioned cars and a number of classic Routemaster buses. There are also two pictures of the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree, one in 1958, the other three years earlier, gifted to London from Oslo, the capital of Norway. In addition, Mr Grant took pictures of children celebrating Christmas in their schools across the city, and others getting excited about toys inside Hamleys. Demonstrating just how easy modern-day families have it at Christmas, the collection also includes pictures of flimsy Christmas trees being sold on a market and fully-feathered turkeys on sale at Leadenhall Market in 1957. This shot shows Regent Street in 1948 looking slightly more modest around Christmas than it would in 2013 . This picture shows how Regent Street prepares for Christmas nowadays, pictured in 2009 . They may have been a little cheaper, but these Christmas trees, seen being purchased in 1957, would not satisfy many modern families . Shoppers can expect to find fir trees in slightly better conditions on London streets this year . Mr Grant also captured a fantastic shot of the interior of St Paul's Cathedral in 1960. The images have been released to mark . the opening of the Museum of London's Docklands’ Santa Grotto, which . opened to the public today. The museum has reconstructed a Victorian version of Wapping and is offering children the opportunity to meet Father Christmas in Sailortown.

Employers  will no longer have to pay National Insurance contributions when they take on workers under the age of 21. George Osborne announced that what he called the ‘jobs tax on young people’ would be abolished by 2015 in a bid to cut the stubbornly high level of youth unemployment. The announcement follows the introduction earlier this year of the Employment Allowance, which cuts £2,000 off the NI bill for thousands of businesses and charities. Jobcentres will be told to do more to help 16 and 17-year-olds who will lose their benefits if they refuse to accept training, work placement or community work . The . new changes for under 21s mean the cost of employing a young person at a . salary of £12,000 will be reduced by £500, the Chancellor said. On a salary of £16,000, the bill will be cut for employers by £1,000. During . his Autumn Statement speech, Mr Osborne said: ‘We are going to abolish . the jobs tax on young people under the age of 21. Employer National . Insurance contributions will be removed altogether on a . million-and-a-half jobs for young people. ‘We’re . not going to leave young people behind as the economy grows. We are . going to have a responsible recovery for all. The cost for a business of . employing a young person on a salary of £12,000 will fall by over £500. For someone on £16,000, that’s over £1,000 off.’ Because . the change requires legislation, it will not happen until April 2015, . and will not apply beyond the upper earnings limit of £42,285, he said. Latest figures show how the proportion of under-25s described as 'NEETs' still stands at almost 15 per cent, despite overall unemployment falling . Curbs: Chancellor George Osborne said young people will not be able to leave school and sign on to the dole . Mr Osborne told MPs that unemployment was forecast to fall in the next few years from 7.6 to 5.6 per cent.Businesses have created three jobs for every one lost in the public sector, and this trend was forecast to continue, he said. Tim Stovold, employment tax partner at accountancy firm Kingston Smith, welcomed the National Insurance changes. ‘Scrapping . NI for the under 21s could save employers up to £4,658 per employee so . is a valuable incentive to employ younger workers,’ he said. ‘This is a . bold move as it will benefit not just small businesses but also . multi-nationals.’ On the up: Almost 30million people are now in work in the UK, up by 1million since the 2010 general election . Lottie . Dexter, director of Million Jobs campaign which called for the move on . NI, said: ‘We are thrilled with this pro-youth Autumn Statement. ‘Levelling . the playing field for under-21s and backing youngsters to succeed means . the Government are clearly serious about tackling youth unemployment.’ Paul Green, from over-50s group Saga, said the announcement was ‘great news’. ‘We . have been campaigning for a cut in taxes on employing young people and . the long-term unemployed for many years and we are delighted the . Government have listened and acted,’ he said. But . Karen Darby, founder of CrowdMission.com, told the BusinessZone . website: ‘I hope we don’t see a spike in unemployment for 22-year-olds.’ And Gareth Stevens, . from QualitySolicitors, said: ‘Removing National Insurance contributions . for employees under the age of 21 will likely lead to a surge in . employment tribunal claims under the age discrimination banner.’ Mr Osborne also launched a crackdown on unscrupulous firms who . designate their workers as self-employed, depriving them of basic . employment rights such as the minimum wage in a bid to avoid employer . National Insurance. Poorly qualified youngsters will be banned from going straight from school to a life on the dole, George Osborne said yesterday. The Chancellor said young jobseekers lacking basic skills will have their benefits docked unless they agree to do up to 16 hours training a week to improve their employment chances. The move is designed to tackle growing fears that the one million young people not in employment, education or training – so-called Neets – could become a ‘lost generation’. Poorly qualified youngsters will be banned from going straight from school to a life on the dole, George Osborne said . It also goes part way towards meeting David Cameron’s party conference pledge in October that youngsters would be required to ‘earn or learn’. But it stops short of his plan to strip benefits from the under-25s, which was vetoed by Nick Clegg. Under the new scheme, youngsters lacking at least a Grade C GCSE in both maths and English will be required to undergo extra training in return for their benefit. Those who are still out of work after six months will be required to sign up for a traineeship, community work or work experience or be stripped of their benefits. The scheme will apply to 18 to 21-year-olds and will be piloted in small areas from next April before being rolled out to the rest of the country. Mr Osborne said: ‘Without basic maths or English, there is a limited chance any young person will be able to stay off welfare. So we are taking a new approach.’ He went on: ‘A culture of worklessness becomes entrenched when young people can leave school and go straight onto the dole, with nothing expected in return. That option is coming to an end in our welfare system.’ Mr Osborne said the Government would also invest around £10million a year in Jobcentre Plus support for 16 and 17-year-olds who want help to find apprenticeships and training. Phil Orford, of the Forum of Private Businesses, welcomed the recognition of the ‘need to ensure young people have the basic skills required for work’. A new cap on total welfare spending will be set next year and take effect in 2015. The Chancellor set out plans for a radical new limit, to be set every five years, that will include housing benefit, tax credits, disability benefits and pensioner benefits, although the state pension will be excluded. Governments will have to comply with any breach of the cap by cutting welfare in what George Osborne says will be a ‘limit on the nation’s credit card’. Ministers say the cap is designed to prevent repeats of the spike in incapacity benefit claims under the Conservative governments of the 1980s and 1990s and the surge in housing benefit under Labour. It is also designed to try to bind Labour’s hands by building structural limits into welfare – a huge proportion of Government spending. Governments will have to comply with any breach of the cap by cutting welfare in what George Osborne says will be a 'limit on the nation's credit card' Labour has indicated that it is prepared to consider backing the idea of a cap, though shadow chancellor Ed Balls has controversially suggested pensions might be included too. Mr Osborne told MPs that benefits which fluctuate with the economy, such as jobseeker’s allowance, would be excluded from the cap, as well as the state pension. But he insisted: ‘All other benefits, from tax credits to income support, to the vast majority of housing benefit, will be included in the cap.’ The Tories argue that including state pensions in the cap would not be fair, since it could mean cutting pensions for those who have worked all their lives because costs on housing benefit were getting out of control. Mr Osborne said the limit on total welfare expenditure would be set by the Chancellor at the beginning of each Parliament, and MPs would be asked to support it. If the limit was breached, the Chancellor would have to explain why, and a vote would be held in Parliament. In 2014, the Government is expected to spend £112bn on welfare payments, excluding state pensions. Charlotte Ravenscroft, of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, warned: ‘Many charities fear the new welfare cap will drive the government to make spending decisions that will lead to vulnerable people bearing the brunt of further cuts.’ Lord Razzall, a Lib Dem trade and industry spokesman, added: ‘The devil will be in the detail.’","School leavers will have to accept training or work experience .

A ‘terminal’ rift has severed relations between Rupert Murdoch and Tony Blair over reports of the former premier’s friendship with the entrepreneur’s ex-wife Wendi Deng, it was reported yesterday. Mr Blair has always stated that his relationship with Miss Deng is platonic. But the media mogul has refused to speak to him since filing for divorce from Miss Deng in June, it is claimed. A 'terminal' rift has severed relations between Rupert Murdoch and Tony Blair over reports of the former premier's friendship with the entrepreneur's ex-wife Wendi Deng, it was reported yesterday . The breakdown of the friendship between the two men – described as a ‘terminal’ argument – is said to stem from claims Mr Blair and Miss Deng, 44, met on a number of occasions without the media mogul’s knowledge. Staff at Mr Murdoch’s Californian cattle ranch claimed Mr Blair and Miss Deng twice stayed overnight on the same weekends in October 2012 and April this year. They also stayed overnight at Mr Murdoch’s home in Los Angeles and met in London and New York, the Mail on Sunday said. There is no suggestion of impropriety by Mr Blair or Miss Deng. In June, Mr Blair was forced to deny unfounded internet rumours which linked him with Mr Murdoch’s divorce. At the time, his spokesman told the Hollywood Reporter: ‘If you are asking if they are having an affair, the answer is no.’ The divorce of Mr Murdoch, 82, and Miss Deng was finalised last week in a US court. Yesterday, friends of both Mr Murdoch and Mr Blair embarked on a war of words about the breakdown of their friendship. Mr and Mrs Blair married in March 1980. They have four children. Mrs Blair still works as a leading lawyer and is a respected recorder. Mr Blair travels the world in his role as a Middle East envoy for the United Nations . An acquaintance of the media tycoon, whose newspaper empire includes The Sun and The Sunday Times, said: ‘Rupert Murdoch will have nothing more to do with Tony Blair. Not ever.’ Another friend told The Mail on Sunday: ‘If you think that Rupert made a decision to end his  marriage and a long-term friendship without just cause, you are sorely mistaken.’ A close friend of Mr Blair told the Mail on Sunday that ‘the ridiculous stories about Wendi and Tony’ were ‘not true’. Friends insisted the relationship between Miss Deng and Mr Blair was ‘entirely innocent and above board’. One added: ‘They never  met alone, there were always others around. ‘They are friends and Blair is godfather to one of the couple’s children, for heaven’s sake.’ Tony and Cherie Blair kept a low-profile and did not emerge from their townhouse in Connaught Square, Westminster, or their Grade I listed stately home in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire, yesterday. Mr and Mrs Blair married in March 1980. They have four children. Mrs Blair still works as a leading lawyer and is a respected recorder. Mr Blair travels the world in his role as a Middle East envoy for the United Nations. Yesterday Andy Hubble, Mr Blair’s neighbour in Wotton Underwood, said: ‘I heard he left early this morning or late last night, around 1am. ‘I don’t know if it was just him that left. They come here most weekends.’ A friend of Rupert Murdoch . Mr Blair and Mr Murdoch formed a powerful political alliance in 1997, when The Sun newspaper dramatically switched its support from the Conservatives to Labour with just six weeks to go before the general election. Mr Murdoch’s support was seen  as crucial to the following three  elections, which kept the Labour leader in Downing Street from 1997 to 2007. The pair formed a strong friendship and Mr Blair became god- father to the Murdochs’ daughter Grace in 2010. A source close to Mr Blair said claims of an affair were ‘categorically untrue’. The source said it was ‘a matter of public record’ that Mr Murdoch filed for a ‘no fault’ divorce. Mr Murdoch met his third wife Miss Deng, a Yale business school graduate, in 1997 on a business trip to Shanghai when she agreed to act as a translator. At a divorce hearing at New York’s Supreme Court, last week, a judge was told they had come to an  ‘amicable’ deal to end their 14- year marriage. Spokesmen for both Mr Murdoch and Mr Blair declined to comment.","Mr Blair has always stated that his relationship with Miss Deng is platonic .

'Monster': Brandy Lee Rose Devine apologized to her dead daughter and three surviving children after being sentenced to 15 years in prison for the toddler's death last July . A California woman was sentenced today to 15 years behind bars in the death of her 2-year-old disabled daughter who was left alone with no food or water for nearly three days while her mother was getting high. Standing in court in a red jail garb with her hair slicked back, a noticeably plumper Brandy Lee Rose Devine apologized to her four children, especially to baby Stephanie, who was discovered dead in her crib July 16, 2012. 'I hope they can forgive me one day,' the woman said. Last month, a jury found Devine, of Turlock, guilty of second-degree murder. She was also convicted on drug counts and cruelty to children. Devine told authorities she smoked methamphetamine in her home with an unknown man while her daughter remained in a room alone all weekend surrounded by cats. Deputy District Attorney John Mayne told the jurors Stephanie starved to death in a 'monstrous' fashion, even though there was plenty of baby formula in the house, and the mother fed her other three children that weekend, Modesto Bee reported. Marcus Mumford, Devine's defense attorney, insisted his client didn't know at the time that not feeding her child or giving her water would result in death and that Devine's conduct was criminally negligent but not murder. At her sentencing Friday, Devine sounded a markedly different note. 'I accept full responsibility for my actions,' she said. 'I want to apologize to everyone who has been affected by my actions.' Little Stephanie Torres was delivered prematurely at 29 weeks and suffered severe medical problems, including cerebral palsy. An autopsy showed that the special-needs child who required constant therapy and medication died from dehydration and malnourishment. At the time of her death Stephanie was nearing her third birthday, but appeared much smaller when her body was examined by a pathologist. Dr Eugene Carpenter testified that the toddler weighed only 13lbs and had soft eyes and skin 'like red dough' indicating lack of water. The victim’s abdomen was caved in to the point that her spine was almost visible through her stomach, according to the medical examiner. In March, neighbor Lydia Whitworth said in court that when she saw Stephanie’s body in the crib on the afternoon of July 16, the child was grey, and her diaper was filled with urine and excrement. Around her, the room was permeated with the stench of cat urine, and feces from Devine's multiple pets littered the floor. The detective who interviewed Devine said that the women told him she had assumed her 6-year-old son was taking care of the 2-year-old special-needs girl while she was busy smoking methamphetamine to make herself feel better.","Stephanie Torres was discovered dead in her crib from dehydration and malnourishment July 16, 2012 .

A Scottish nightclub has installed a two-way mirror allowing male revellers to secretly spy on women when they visit the venue's toilets. Only clubbers who hire out either of the two £800-a-time private rooms at The Shimmy Club in Glasgow can view the spyglass which overlooks the sinks in the women's toilets. Similar to the those used in police interrogation rooms, the mirror allows revellers in the private function rooms to spy on those in the women's toilets without their knowledge. 'Violation': Outraged women's rights campaigners have voiced their disgust after The Shimmy Club in Glasgow placed a two-way mirror looking into the women's toilets (stock image) A picture taken inside one of the rooms and leaked on the internet shows two female clubbers applying make-up in the toilets completely unaware they are being watched. The two-way mirror has outraged female guests and women's rights campaigners. The nightclub, which is owned by millionaire entrepreneur Stefan King’s G1 Group, has defended the 'interactive feature' as 'a bit of fun'. A comment posted on the nightclub's Facebook page read: 'The Shimmy Club’s two-way mirror is a design feature created as a bit of fun, an interactive feature which we hoped would act as a talking point for people visiting The Shimmy. The vast majority of people who have visited the club have taken it as such. 'It's clear that those who are negatively commenting online may not have been lucky enough to get past the door staff yet and viewed the area as they would have seen that the sight line is very limited and allows for glimpses into the wash up area only of the ladies loos (there is also a separate mirror area which is completely out of view of the club). 'There has always been signage in the toilets which no-one has mentioned thus far but as a result of the media feedback clearer signage has been put in place to inform our female customers. 'Overall our customers seem to enjoy this unique idea, loads of you have used the opportunity as it was intended and knowingly had pictures taken acting up to the camera individually or in a group of friends. Comment: The Shimmy Club management left this response, pictured right, to complaints about its two-way mirror on its Facebook page . 'However we are committed to listening to you guys who are our core customer base and hugely appreciate your loyalty so if your feedback (and not that of the media) is that you want the mirror area to change then we will listen to that and make changes.' A spokesman for the club claimed that men and mixed groups are not allowed to hire the rooms. But a photograph on the venue’s own Facebook site showed two young women in a bathroom while a man looks on from the other side of the mirror, the Daily Express reports. Shocked female revellers have told how they were completely unaware of the mirror and had no idea they could be viewed by people in private rooms as they used the venue's toilet. One clubber whom asked not to be named told the newspaper: 'I was completely shocked to discover that the mirror in the ladies’ bathroom is a two-way mirror facing out onto the club. I find it absolutely outrageous that a club can get away with this, it is a complete invasion of privacy of the unsuspecting girls. 'Nowhere is it made clear that this is the case so when visiting the bathroom for the first time, there are women bending over the sink, pouting into the mirror to redo their lipstick, adjusting themselves whilst unknowingly being watched by people on the other side. 'The fact that these two-way mirrors only look into the ladies’ bathrooms and not the men’s makes it clear that the intention is to sexualise women as objects, allowing men to make inappropriate gestures and leer disgustingly at them.' The Scottish arm of sexual harassment group Hollaback said it was ‘shocked’ at the reports, saying they were ‘gob smacking’. Glasgow MSP Drew Smith said he was concerned about the set up, adding: 'I think most of us find the concept of a voyeur toilet disturbing. 'I would urge the management of this club to board it up and show their customers some respect. 'Women using a washroom should not have to worry about whether they are part of some kind of bizarre peep show.' An online petition has also been started calling for awards that were given to venue owner G1 Group to be retracted. A spokesman for Glasgow Licensing Board said: 'Complaints have been received about these premises and licensing standards officers are currently investigating.'","Two private booths at The Shimmy Club in Glasgow cost £800-a-night to hire .

His street cleaning or equivalent punishment was expected to be in Moscow, but last week he moved his ‘propiska’, or official registration of residency, from the capital to the remote village with a population of 620, where he also owns a giant potato farm. ‘It is my right as a citizen,’ he said. ‘I thought it would be much more useful in Popovka village.

A draconian charge of ‘hooliganism motivated by political hatred’, under which Mr Lebedev could have been jailed for up to five years, was withdrawn. It had been seen by critics as an attack on press freedom. Mr Lebedev, 53, owns major Russian investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta. His son Evgeny, who sat beside his father in court earlier this year, controls the day to day business of the London Evening Standard and The Independent titles. Before the verdict, property mogul Mr Polonsky had called for Mr Lebedev to be acquitted and even the state prosecutor pleaded for the hooliganism charge to be dropped.

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 12:01 EST, 23 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:44 EST, 23 December 2012 . Pay freeze: Nurses have seen a real terms pay cut while executives have enjoyed a two per cent rise . NHS executives have enjoyed a two per cent pay rise over the past year - even though nurses are suffering a pay freeze. Official statistics show that senior managers, such as finance directors and human resource officers, now earn an average of £74,654. This is up £1,459 from the average figure last September. The pay rises for bureaucrats come despite the fact that nurses have been suffering a two-year pay freeze since March last year. Nurses start at £21,000 a year and their average salary is just over £30,000. The pay freeze means that, in real terms, their pay has been cut - because of the rising cost of living. Separate figures, released following a parliamentary question, indicate that more nursing staff have lost their jobs since the election than managers. In August of this year, there were 4,544 fewer bureaucrats working in the NHS than there were in August 2010 - many of them walking off with six-figure pay-offs. But over the same period, the number of qualified nurses, midwives and health visitors plummeted by 4,573. It means that 29 more frontline nursing staff lost their jobs than administrators during the two year period. And, to make matters worse, no fewer than 1,341 of the departing managers received redundancy pay-outs of more than £100,000. The total includes 173 who were paid more than £200,000 when the organisations for which they worked were abolished. In total, almost £1billion has been paid in redundancy packages to managers since the election. John Lister, of campaign group Health Emergency, said of the pay figures: ‘This is yet another hammer blow to the morale of our nurses. ‘Frontline staff are now working longer hours under extraordinary pressures for no extra pay. Despite that, it is a small band of well-paid execs who are being rewarded with higher wages.’ Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Nursing staff are already being stretched to breaking point because of staffing cuts, and on top of that they are seeing their pay being cut in real terms. ‘Chief executives enjoying a significant increase in pay sends completely the wrong message to hard working frontline staff.’ Andrew Gwynne, Labour's health spokesman, said David Cameron is allowing frontline staff to 'take a battering' Earlier this month a damning report by the Care Quality Commission found that many trusts were failing to meet quality standards because they employed too few nursing staff. Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The NHS needs nurses treating the sick not back-room form fillers. ‘This is yet further evidence that hospital bosses are managing their budgets poorly. They should be protecting the front line while cutting back the bloated bureaucracy. ‘There are necessary savings to be made but it appears NHS management are incapable of taking the right decisions for taxpayers and patients.’ Labour’s health spokesman Andrew Gwynne, who obtained the figures on staffing levels, said the true position was much worse. He said that once health visitors and midwives are taken out of the picture, the number of nurses has fallen by around 7,000 since the election. ‘The Prime Minister’s boasts about cutting NHS bureaucracy have come to nothing,’ he said. ‘Instead, he’s quietly axed the jobs of thousands more nurses than managers. ‘David Cameron is allowing the front-line of the NHS to take a battering as he cuts the budget. He has wasted £3bn on a re-organisation of the NHS back-office that is adding fresh layers of bureaucracy and damaging patient care. ‘As the NHS haemorrhages nursing staff patients will pay the price of David Cameron’s false promises. Ministers are taking unacceptable risks with standards of patient care. They cannot continue to ignore the warnings from nurses’ and doctors’ leaders.’","Statistics show senior managers now earn an average of almost £75,000 .

The founder of a popular anti-sexism blog has spoken about her goal of making both men and women understand that sexism is unacceptable and must be talked about honestly and openly if it is to ever be stamped out. Laura Bates, 26, is the London-based brains behind Everyday Sexism, the popular blog which publishes stories from men and women who have witnessed 'casual sexism' in action. Speaking to the MailOnline, Bates said that she, like many women around the world, has been the victim of almost daily 'sexual objectification', from catcalls to bottom-pinching - and that it's time for people to realise that such actions are unacceptable, and in many cases illegal. Grabbing, slapping or pinching a woman's bottom without her consent is sexual assault, despite what many people think . She said: 'Launching the blog was a combination of personal experience of everyday sexism and realising how common they were, and realising that I . wasn't speaking up about them because they were so normal. 'In one week I . was shouted at three times, so I started speaking to other women to see if they . had similar experiences, and every single woman I approached had not one but hundreds. 'Street harassment, sexual harassment in the workplace... and not only were we altering our own behaviour to avoid it, we were being also told this wasn't an issue anymore, but clearly it is.' People told Laura she was 'whining', and she realised a solution wasn't going to come about overnight. But she saw that if she was able to catalogue every woman's story in one place, disbelievers might begin to acknowledge the severity of the situation. She added: 'Some of the stories are seriously shocking: schoolgirls as young as 11 being catcalled in the street, women being grabbed and manhandled by strangers, men driving up onto the pavement when a woman ignores his shouts.'

An Army veteran has had his benefits slashed after he told Jobcentre staff that he had volunteered to sell poppies in honour of his former comrades. Stephen Taylor, 60, was receiving £71.20 a week in Jobseeker's Allowance while searching for work after losing a previous job as a pub manager. However, when he said he had been raising money for the Royal British Legion, they told him he was not doing enough to find a new job and withdrew the payment. Anger: Army veteran Stephen Taylor had his benefits cut because he volunteered to sell poppies . Mr Taylor served as a Fusilier in Cuprus, Kenya and Northern Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s. He volunteered to sell poppies outside an Asda in Bury, Greater Manchester, during the fortnight leading up to Remembrance Sunday this year, spending a total of 24 hours on the activity. When he went to sign on and told workers about his volunteering, they stopped his Jobseekers' Allowance because they said he should be spending his time handing out CVs and applying for work. Mr Taylor has now had to live without the payment for four weeks, and is increasingly struggling with his finances. 'The allowance is not very much, but when you don't have much, it means a lot,' the father of four said. 'It is all wrong. You volunteer and sell poppies to remember people and friends you have lost.' He spent a total of 16 years in the military, serving with the 1st Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and the Territorial Army from 1972 to 1988. Good deed: Mr Taylor was raising money for the Royal British Legion in memory of his former comrades . Since then Mr Taylor has worked in a number of jobs, including managing pubs around the country, but he has not been employed since November last year. He says he has applied for a number of jobs - including at the Asda store where he was volunteering - but has received just one response in the past 12 months. 'I have tried all sorts,' he said. 'There are no jobs going, but I am waiting for a call from one application. 'It is impossible. You can apply for every job that is going, but it is another thing actually getting one because there are that many people applying.' The former soldier has had to seek financial support from the Bury Armed Forces Covenant group, but has nonetheless fallen behind with his rent. Local councillor James Frith criticised the handling of Mr Taylor's case, saying: 'I was astonished. Any time I speak with Stephen you can tell that he has searching for work and has served his country throughout his life. 'For me, it is an issue of applying discretion and leniency in dealing with such sensitive issues. 'To treat somebody who has put himself in harm's way for the people of Bury and his country is unacceptable.' A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'It's only right that people should do everything they can to find work in return for their benefits. 'We make it clear to people at the start of their claim what the rules are and that they risk losing their benefits if they don't play by them. 'Sanctions are only used as a last resort and people who are in genuine need can apply for hardship payments. If someone disagrees with a decision made on their claim, they can appeal.'","Stephen Taylor, 60, claimed Jobseekers' Allowance while looking for work .

Do you think spending your holiday flopped face-down in a bucket of Malibu-pineapple while snoozing beside the pool leaves you refreshed, replenished and ready to face the year of office politics looming ahead? Sorry, but you're wrong. People who use holidays as a chance to catch up on 40 (or even 140) winks find it much trickier readjusting to real life after a vacation than those who go on energetic holidays. Some 82 per cent of Brits find it difficult to get back into the swing of life when they return from holidays, and say that it takes them around four days to fully recover. But many of those who go on active holidays say it takes them just one. People who use holidays as a chance to . catch up on 40 (or even 140) winks find it much trickier readjusting to . real life after a vacation than those who go on energetic holidays . In fact, the best way to leave yourself feeling refreshed, replenished and ready to take on office politics until your next break is to spend annual leave doing something that gets your blood pumping, such as skiing, hiking, diving or swimming, according to research. Holidaymakers who take lazy trips return feeling sleepy, and beach-goers also struggle thanks to over-indulging on exotic food and enjoying too many late nights in seafront bars. Some 31 per cent admit they take longer to complete tasks at . work in the days immediately after returning from a holiday, and a quarter have forgotten to do a job altogether. More than one in five oversleep and another 17 per cent end up making mistakes. Almost one in ten miss important deadlines because their head is still in 'relax' mode, and a quarter of workers have even had a colleague or their manager comment on the time it takes them to get over the holiday blues.

'But while you may feel like you are recharging your batteries, it seems that you are more likely to get home feeling sluggish and lacking in energy. 'Dozing in the sunshine and chilling out all day can have an effect on your body clock so although you come back from a holiday expecting to feel better for it, it can be a real struggle for a few days as your body gets used to your daily routine again.'","82 per cent of Brits feel exhausted after holidays .

Education Secretary Michael Gove accused university bosses yesterday of ‘pandering to extremism’ by endorsing the compulsory segregation of audiences for campus visits by hard-line Islamic speakers. He said it was ‘a disgrace’ for Universities UK to support the policy of separating men from women at lectures and debates. Mr Gove told the Daily Mail: ‘We should not pander to extremism. Speakers who insist on segregating audiences should not be indulged by educators, . The divide: Separate ways in for the different sexes at a Leicester university debate . ‘This guidance is wrong and harmful. Universities UK should withdraw it immediately.’ Universities UK – an umbrella body representing university vice-chancellors –  caused further controversy yesterday, when its chief executive Nicola Dandridge said Muslim women were ‘comfortable’ being separated from men during talks by Islamic clerics on UK campuses. Commenting on BBC Radio, she said colleges must ‘respect’ the views of extremists who want segregation during lectures. ‘If people feel more comfortable about sitting separately, and that’s invariably the situation that will arise in these cases, then universities have to listen to those views,’ she added. ‘What is very uncomfortable about this argument is you are assuming that we have the right to impose views on participants. If the participants say this is  how they want it to be, it is not appropriate for us to disregard their views.’ However, Universities UK was yesterday unable to provide any evidence that most Muslim women were happy to sit separately. And the pressure group Student Rights said the opposite was true, citing a 2008 YouGov poll which showed that nine out of ten Muslim students thought segregation was unacceptable. Female students and campaigners yesterday told the Mail they had been incensed when they arrived at events to find they had to sit separately. A report produced this week by Student Rights found that out of 180 visits by Islamic speakers to UK universities over a 12 month period, 46 lectures at 21 institutions have insisted on segregated audiences. Women were, in most cases, forced to enter the room from a separate door and to sit at the back. Analysis carried out by anti-extremist group Student Rights found that over a 12-month period, 46 university events explicitly promoted separate seating for men and women or female-only events. Among those was an Islam v  Atheism debate held at University College London in March, at which students claimed security staff tried to move those who would not  comply. During the debate, organised by the Islamic Education and Research Academy, women were told to sit at the back of the room. At the University of Leicester,  separate entrances for ‘Brothers’ and ‘Sisters’ were in operation for the Islamic debate, ‘Does God Exist?’. A lecture called Dawah of the  Victorious, advertised by Metropolitan University’s Islamic Society, stated it would be ‘fully segregated’ in promotional material. And two events held at the University of Portsmouth during Islamic Awareness Week were promoted on Facebook stating ‘segregation will be provided to the best of our abilities’. Student Rights say gender segregation has occurred despite all 21  of the universities having equality and diversity policies in place. Some lectures barred women totally, making them watch proceedings from another room via a television feed. Rupert Sutton, of Student Rights – which monitors extremism on campuses – said: ‘Universities UK has decided the religious freedom of a radical speaker is more important than a woman’s rights to sit where she wants in a room.’ Sara Khan, 33, founder of counter-extremism group Inspire, said: ‘By allowing gender segregation, Universities UK are complicit in the gender inequality being perpetuated by Islamic societies. ‘Universities UK delves into trying to tell us what constitutes Muslim religious belief implying that those opposed to segregation must be people from outside of the Islamic faith, not recognising that often it is Muslims themselves who oppose gender segregation.’ The explosive report showing segregation at lectures across the country comes after a row in March over ‘forced segregation’ for an event at University College, London. An investigation was launched after students complained single women were made to sit at the back of the room for the debate – about Islam and atheism. The organisers claimed to have provided a mixed seating area for those objecting to segregation but students who were there said this did not happen. Dana Sondergaard, who attended the event, said: ‘After having been told the event would not be gender segregated, we arrived and were told that women were to sit in the back of the auditorium, while men and couples could file into the front.’ She said three people were thrown out for refusing to abide by the rules. Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove said it was 'a disgrace' for Universities UK to support the policy of separating men from women at lectures and debates . A month later the University of Leicester also held an investigation, after a photograph emerged showing separate entrances to a lecture for men and women. Yesterday, Universities UK wrote to the Equality and Human Rights Commission for a definitive legal view. Critics said Universities UK was turning a blind eye to segregation to protect donations from Middle Eastern countries and to attract high fee-paying foreign students from the Persian Gulf. Abdurraheem Green of pressure group the Islamic Education and Research Academy said: ‘The idea of being forced to sit with people of the opposite sex might well lead many to avoid choosing this country to further their education.’ A Government spokesman said: ‘We see no valid reason why men and women should be segregated simply to listen to a guest speaker.’","Education Secretary: it is ‘a disgrace’ for Universities UK to support policy .

The giant fish is 20 times the average weight for the species and could feed more than 500 people. What a whopper! The 150-year-old halibut, minus its head, with anglers Dean Robert (left), who landed the fish, and John Morrow . Quite a catch: Anglers in Hull - from left, Neil Cutsforth, Dean Roberts, John Morrow and filleter Rob Pinch - used the fish's colossal weight to estimate its age . The huge creature has been shipped to Hull, Yorkshire, where anglers have used its mammoth weight to estimate its age. Fish merchant Dean Roberts, who has landed the giant catch, said: ‘It’s a bit of a monster. ‘This one has got to be about 150 years old. It’s about a kilo for every year of growth and it weighs 27 stone, or 169kg, without its head. ‘It’s got away with not being caught for a very long time.’ Heavy load: The fish weighs 27 stone without its head, pictured, or 31 stone in all . Mr Roberts has already had a lot of interest from restaurants desperate for a fillet of the record-breaking fish and he is hoping to fetch more than £1,500 for the huge halibut. He said: ‘Halibut is a much sought-after fish. It’s mainly a restaurant commodity. A lot of big restaurants in London sell it.’ After it is processed and filleted by his buyer, a fish merchant in Fleetwood, it could fetch as much as £3,000. High price: Filleter Rob Pinch thinks the crew could get up to £3,000 for the fish once it has been processed . Mr Roberts, who co-owns fish merchant . Norstar, said: ‘All the fish we sell come from a sustainable source. This was caught on a hook and a line. 'The hooks are baited, they put . them over the side and a few hours later they bring them back in. 'It’s a . lot better for the environment and a better way of fishing.’ But despite its size, the huge fish is not quite as large as the largest halibut ever caught. In July, German Marco Liebenow caught a 37-stone whopper. It took 90 minutes to reel the 9ft long fish towards the surface, as it was too big to haul on to his small boat in Norway. The previous largest halibut was caught in 2010 by veteran German angler Günther Hansel, 70, who reeled in a 34-stone (220kg) monster, which was sold for £2,000.","Giant fish 20 times the average weight for species and could feed 500 .

Al Qaeda today said a suicide attack on a Yemeni defence compound which left 52 dead and 167 injured was in retaliation for U.S. drone strikes on its militants. The terrorist group boasted on Twitter that they 'stormed' the facility as part of its war on drones because it was a base from which U.S. personnel operated the remote-controlled planes. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) - regarded by Washington as the jihadist network's most dangerous affiliate - has suffered heavy losses after the U.S. intensified drone strikes in Yemen this year. Scroll down for video . Explosion: Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for this attack in which explosives-packed car hit Yemen's Defense Ministry complex in Sanaa . Debris: A car is burning at the site of a suicide car bombing at the defence ministry in the Yemeni capital Sanaa . But there was no immediate evidence to . support its allegation that the Sanaa complex attacked on Thursday . played any role in the drone war or housed any U.S. personnel. All of the dead came in a hospital inside the sprawling facility which bore the brunt of the armed assault that came after a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle packed with explosives into the main gate. The complex in central Sanaa was 'stormed... after the mujahedeen (holy warriors) proved that it accommodates drone control rooms and American experts,' AQAP said in a statement published by its media arm on Twitter. 'As part of a policy to target drone control rooms, the mujahedeen have dealt a heavy blow to one,' it said. 'Such security headquarters in partnership with the Americans in their war on these Muslim people are a justified target wherever they may be.' Drone warfare: Al Qaeda said thier attack on the compound was retaliation over U.S. drone strikes. (pictured an artist impression of a Predator Drone firing a missile) The use of drones to attack suspected . militants has become an extremely controversial topic with America . accused of killing innocent people during operations. Last . month, American military chiefs had to apologise after mistakenly . killing three civilians during a drone strike in Afghanistan. Speaking . at the time, Col. Jane Crichton, director of public affairs for NATO's . International Security Assistance Force, said a preliminary . investigation had found that although the airstrike killed eight . insurgents, ‘there were, unfortunately, believed to be three civilian . casualties,’ for which the ISAF expressed ‘deep regret.’ U.S. Air Force Maj.

Afghanistan, added: ‘Our goal is to eradicate civilian casualties, but . that is an incredibly difficult task when the enemy is intermixed with . the civilian population.' Terror: Smoke rises from the Defence Ministry's compound after an attack, in Sanaa yesterday . The number of dead from U.S. drone strikes in Yemen remains unclear and estimates vary widely. According . to the New America Foundation, a Washington-based think-tank that has . tried to keep track of the numbers, there have been 93 strikes since . 2002 which have killed between 684 and 891 people, among them between 64 . and 66 civilians.

Deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said she had no information about any US casualties.

Crater: The enormous explosion left a wide area of destruction . The defence ministry said gunmen occupied the hospital after the explosion, but that security forces had regained control of the building. But residents in Sanaa said the sounds of clashes and explosions rang out from the area and were heard across the capital throughout the night until fighting subsided at dawn on Friday. The area was cordoned off in the morning while armoured vehicles blocked all roads leading to the defence complex, witnesses said. A search was mounted for two suspected bomb-laden vehicles the militants were planning to use in more attacks, said security officials, who added that up to 25 militants had carried Thursday's assault. The brazen daylight attack on the complex followed a spate of hit-and-run strikes on military personnel and officials, as Yemen struggles to complete a thorny political transition. The attacks have mostly generally been blamed on AQAP, which remains very active despite suffering setbacks in a major army offensive in the south last year and repeated U.S. drone strikes on its commanders. AQAP has been linked to several attempted attacks on the United States, including a botched bid to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009, which have made it a major target of the US 'war on terror'.","Suicide bomber drove a car packed with explosives into military site .

Vivian Mayo, 57, of Cantwell, Alaska, was found at about 1 a.m. on Wednesday sharing body heat with Elvis, a small, brown dog of unknown breed . Megan Peters, spokeswoman for the troopers, said the dog likely helped Mayo preserve her body heat. 'It really did help save her life,' Peters said. 'Elvis is a little hero.' Mayo's ordeal began over the weekend. She and her husband, Scott Mayo, 61, traveled on snowmobiles to a cabin near Mile 105 of Denali Highway, a mostly gravel east-west road east of Denali National Park and Preserve. The highway connects two paved highways but is not maintained during winter months and is not open to cars and trucks. Scott Mayo departed the cabin by snowmobile Saturday to check on a trap line that started four to five miles away, Peters said. He had not returned by Sunday. The Mayos were not due back to Cantwell, a community at the west side of the Denali Highway, until Tuesday night, and Vivian Mayo made the decision to return to Cantwell and seek help for her husband. She did not get far. Her snowmobile broke down Sunday about a mile from the cabin. Vivian's husband Scott Mayo was found just two to three miles from their cabin and he is reported to be in good condition despite four nights in the cold . The Mayos had told family members they would be back by 7 p.m. on Tuesday, and if they weren't back by 10 p.m. on Tuesday, to alert authorities. Family members called troopers on Tuesday night. Alaska Wildlife Trooper James Ellison and volunteer rescuers headed out and found Vivian Mayo in about three hours, Peters said. Mayo was starting her third night in the frigid temperatures, which dipped as low as minus 20 degrees. Her mobility was limited, Peters said, and she could not simply walk the mile back to the cabin. The burned-out snowmobile had been tipped over and Mayo was using the shell for shelter, cuddled with Elvis, Peters said. She did not know how Mayo ignited the snowmobile. Mayo at one point told rescuers that she saw wolves approaching but troopers found no tracks or other indication of the predators. Ellison activated a personal locator beacon to alert the Alaska Rescue Coordination Center in Anchorage and took Mayo and Elvis back to the cabin. Vivian and Scott Mayo traveled on snowmobiles to a cabin near Mile 105 of Denali Highway, a mostly gravel east-west road east of Denali National Park and Preserve . The searchers turned their focus to finding Scott Mayo. Ellison at 2:45 a.m. reported finding what he believed was Scott Mayo's trail. He gave trail coordinates to the rescue center, which responded with a C-130 airplane and a Pave Hawk helicopter. Searchers in the airplane spotted Scott Mayo at 5:13 a.m., just two to three miles from the cabin, Peters said. Tracks from his snowmobile indicated he had traveled much farther. He had built a small warming fire and was reported in good condition despite starting his fourth night in the cold. The Pave Hawk landed and took Mayo back to the cabin before the Mayos were flown by helicopter to Anchorage. Both Vivian and Scott Mayo had been released from a hospital by Thursday afternoon, Peters said. Calls to their home Thursday went unanswered.","Vivian Mayo, 57, of Cantwell, Alaska, was found on Wednesday sharing body heat with Elvis, her pet dog who hadn't left her side .

The BBC is spending up to £500,000 on a major refit of its £1 billion new headquarters because staff have complained their state-of-the art surroundings ‘lack character’. The high-spec London HQ was only opened in June – four years behind schedule and £55 million over budget. But the Corporation has already decided to revamp two floors of New Broadcasting House to make them ‘more creative and vibrant’ – following a string of gripes from staff. Critics have branded the move a ‘ludicrous’ use of the licence fee. The BBC is set to spend £500,000 revamping two floors of New Broadcasting House just six months after the new building was opened £55million over budget in June. It comes after staff complained their surroundings 'lacked character' Among the more bizarre innovations will be internal road signs based on past and present BBC programmes to help staff find their way around their departments. Dubbed ‘wayfinders’, the signs include Who Do You Think You Arcade, Little Britain’s Passage, EastEnders Common, Goodness Gracious Mead, Have I Got Mews and The Great British Bake Wharf. The costly interior design revamp will also include new floor coverings, the introduction of ‘a new collaboration project zone’, new meeting areas, ‘break-out furniture’ and revamped dressing room doors. Danny Cohen, the BBC’s £327,000-a-year director of television, has defended the changes, which he admits were prompted by staff complaints. In an email to workers, he wrote: ‘Over the next few months, we are planning some design changes on the sixth and seventh floors of New Broadcasting House. ‘We have decided to make these changes in response to strong feedback from television staff that the floors did not feel like creative spaces and lacked character. It was something people felt particularly strongly about when we moved in.’ In his message, Mr Cohen pays tribute to a committee of staff volunteers drawn from both floors who came up with a list of ‘reasonably costed’ improvements. New 'wayfinders' in the form of London road signs will help guide staff through the new state-of-the-art building. They are part of £500,000 plans to make the building 'more creative and vibrant' The sixth floor, currently home to some of the BBC’s most senior staff, including Charlotte Moore, the £244,000-a-year controller  of BBC 1, and Janice Hadlow,  the £235,000-a-year head of  BBC 2, is to be rebranded in line with the theme ‘Welcome to the world of television’. Seating areas will have existing backdrops replaced with new ones featuring iconic BBC logos and programmes. Other changes for the floor include ‘feature seating’,  a ceiling-suspended lighting rig, new fabric wrap panels for a meeting room and a series of ‘magnetic glass boards’. The seventh floor, home to Ben Stephenson, the £247,000-a-year drama commissioning controller, and Christine Langan, the £176,000-a-year head of BBC Films, will include a streetscape called The Street. Its design will include bus-stop-type structures, new soft seating, railings, planters, an EastEnders Albert Square street sign and a pub window that wouldn’t look out of place in the flagship soap. One design expert who has worked on similar schemes said the work was likely to cost in the region of £500,000. He added: ‘It’s projects like this where the costs really start to rack up.’ But a BBC source claimed the work could be implemented for £100,000. Both Labour and Tory MPs last night criticised the revamp as unjustifiable during hard economic times. John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the Commons Select Committee for Culture, Media and Sport, said: ‘It seems extraordinary that the BBC can spend money on things like this at a time when it says its services and programme budgets are under threat.’ Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘None of us get everything right when we move into a new building, but spending money on what sound like questionable improvements is inappropriate when money is tight.’ And Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘I think this is ludicrous. It proves the BBC has still got far too much money to spend.’ A BBC spokesman said the changes were cosmetic and that the revamp was confined to communal areas. He said the floors had originally been designed for World Service and news staff who had been relocated elsewhere. He added: ‘The BBC must ensure it continues to produce fantastic television programmes for licence-fee-payers so some changes are being made to create the most effective working environment possible for staff.’","High-spec London HQ only opened in June - £55 million over budget .

A gardener put in intensive care after crashing his bicycle died of alcohol withdrawal because he wasn't drinking his daily pack of strong lager, an inquest heard. Victor Pickston - a well-known prankster who was spared jail for sending a hoax bomb to a pub - broke 11 ribs and cut his left kidney when he crashed into a wheelie bin, tumbling over the handlebars. He survived but doctors at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, grew worried when the 51-year-old became delirious. Despite treatment, he died a week later of a cardiac arrest. Tragic: Victor Pickston, 51, died in intensive care at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London (pictured) - not because of a serious bicycle crash he had suffered, but because he missed his usual dose of Stella Artois . The gardener was cycling home at lunchtime on January 11 when he careered into a large wheelie bin on the pavement in his home town of Epsom, Surrey, an inquest heard. Drivers who dialled 999 reported a 'strong smell of alcohol' on him and he was taken to Epsom General Hospital, where he discharged himself later that day because he was 'getting bored' of waiting to be seen. Tipple: Mr Pickston favoured Stella Artois, a strong lager of 4.8 to 5.2 per cent, his brother said . That evening he collapsed in pain at his girlfriend's house and was taken to St George's Hospital, where he was admitted to intensive care the next day. His condition deteriorated and after two negative brain scans, medics diagnosed him with alcohol withdrawal syndrome and gave him medication and vitamins to combat its effects. Despite their efforts, Mr Pickston suffered a cardiac arrest on January 18 and could not be resuscitated. Mr Pickston's brother Lawrence told an inquest his brother was not an alcoholic and never seemed drunk. He said his brother bought four cans of Stella Artois, a strong Belgian lager which typically has an alcohol content of 4.8 to 5.2 per cent, after work each day. He added: 'He held down a job, he looked after my father who was in his 80s and he looked after his invalid girlfriend,"" he said. 'To me, he did not have a drink problem. Whenever I saw him, he never seemed actually drunk.' Pathologist Dr Michael Heath said Mr Pickston's heart had swelled to double the size of an average person. His liver was also twice the average weight, despite an earlier operation to remove half of the organ, which was described as 'incredibly fatty'. Mr Pickston also had a Body Mass Index of 33, making him clinically obese. The pathologist said: 'There's evidence Mr Pickston has used a little bit too much alcohol in the past. His heart was double its normal size. That could be due to high blood pressure and also because of alcohol. 'His liver was double the size despite half the liver being removed. That is due to chronic alcohol misuse over a considerable period of time. Crash: Mr Pickston broke 11 ribs and cut his left kidney when he was hurled over a wheelie bin in Chessington Road, Epsom (pictured). He discharged himself from hospital but was readmitted after he collapsed . 'He was getting better and suddenly there appears to be a sudden deterioration. This was likely to be as a consequence of withdrawing from alcohol.' Dr Heath said the lack of alcohol in Mr Pickston's system caused potassium levels in his blood to rise, leading to the fatal cardiac arrest. 'The biochemistry of the blood is so abnormal that it cannot be reverted,' the pathologist said. He gave the cause of death as cardiac arrest due to multiple injuries, with a secondary cause of 'established chronic liver disease with ongoing steatosis and cirrhosis, and acute confusion and delirium due to alcohol withdrawal syndrome'. The 51-year-old was a well-known prankster in Epsom, Surrey. In 2009, he received a suspended sentence at Guildford Crown Court after he admitted sending a hoax bomb to Ewell's Wheatsheaf pub in what was described as a 'practical joke gone wrong.' He left with a bottle of Tabasco sauce used in a Bloody Mary drink and sent it in a brown envelope to the pub the next day, along with a battery and a mobile phone. Prankster: The 51-year-old became famous after sending a hoax bomb to The Wheatsheaf pub in Ewell, Surrey, made out of a bottle of Tabasco sauce, a mobile phone and a battery. He also made pies from dog poo . The incident sparked a full response by the Army bomb disposal squad and his barrister told the court: 'He does have a reputation as a bit of a joker. He once made pies out of dog poo.' Coroner Karen Henderson recorded a verdict of accidental death. She added: 'It's clear there was a sudden, unpredictable cardiac arrest. We've heard a sudden cardiac arrest can occur because of withdrawal from alcohol. I find that was the case. 'Alcohol had played a significant part in Mr Pickston's life and it caused the damage that ultimately made it unsurvivable from this really unfortunate fall.' Mr Pickston's brother declined to comment after the inquest.","Victor Pickston, 51, had a cardiac arrest after suffering alcohol withdrawal .

Furniture giant IKEA has recalled millions of children's lamps after a 17-month-old baby choked on the light's cord and died. Daniel Madden, from Glasgow, became tangled up in the power cable of the lamp - part of the 'SMILA' series - after pulling it into his crib in October last year. He was taken to the city's Royal Hospital for Sick Children, but could not be revived by doctors. Daniel is not the only child to have been endangered by the product. Another 15-month-old baby was nearly strangled to death due to a similar incident. Now IKEA has decided to recall the wall-mounted lamps - priced from £6 to £8 - which have been on sale in the store since 1999. The lights, which are about 11 inches high and 11 inches wide, come in eight different designs. These include blue star, yellow moon, pink flower, white flower, red heart, green bug, blue seashell and orange seahorse. A staggering 23million of the items have been recalled worldwide - including almost three million in America, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Swedish retailer - which is best known for its cut-price flat-pack furniture - has recalled a further 1.1million of the lamps in Canada. It is believed that IKEA only became . aware that the 'SMILA' lamp was involved in Daniel’s death in May, . according to The Scottish Express.

When James and Emily Bradshaw made a commitment last  January to buy only British products, they knew this Christmas was going to be a challenge.  Toys for their three-year-old son Lucan were likely to present a problem, as was finding non-Chinese tinsel. Yet even they didn’t predict they’d have to forgo lighting the Christmas pudding this year. They couldn’t find any British matches. ‘It was a bit of a surprise,’ admits James, a former lawyer from Westerham in Kent. ‘The match industry in the UK is famous but now even the brand England’s Glory, which has the big Union Flag on the box, says England’s Glory Made In Sweden.’ British Christmas: The Bradshaw family have been buying UK productions for the duration of 2013 and were surprised to find that buying British has been cheaper than buying from abroad . The irony is not lost on the Bradshaws, the self-styled, ‘truly British family,’ who have spent the last 12 months buying only goods made in the UK and services supplied by British firms. Everything from the clothes they wear to the wine they drink to the electricity that powers their two-bedroomed semi has been made or provided by a British company. James, 35, and Emily, a 30-year-old teacher, decided to embark on the project after reading about how little tax multi-national companies such as Amazon pay while small UK firms continue to struggle. And as they approach the end of the year, their venture, championed by The Mail on Sunday, has led to some unexpected discoveries, not least that buying British has been cheaper than buying from abroad. A true English Roast: The Bradshaws have made sure all their holiday food is from the UK (stock image) James says: ‘We are consistently . finding that British products are cheaper. That’s mainly because to buy . British food means buying what is in season and, where possible, . preserving them for eating at other times of year. ‘Supermarkets aren’t a cheap option for buying food – though their marketing would suggest they are.’ The . Bradshaws expected to find clothing more difficult. While the British . luxury goods sector is thriving, the high-street relies heavily on . foreign imports. Emily . says: ‘There’s a manufacturer who produces jeans in Wales, but they are . perhaps not suitable to most frames, and they’re £350 a pair. 'But . I got my dress from Closet Clothing in East London for £30. 'That is . probably less than you would spend in Next or M&S. So options are . limited, but when I found that company all of a sudden I could buy . clothes.’ Challenging the . preconception that it is difficult to buy British has been one of the . most interesting parts of the experiment for James. He says: ‘Our story . is a positive one in that we can say that Britain is able to produce . things that rival any importer.’ There is also an important economic argument. James explains: ‘An economist told us that if everybody in the UK spent an extra £11 a week on British-made goods, it would help reduce the trade deficit within 12 months. ‘That’s the power the consumer has on the economy. 'We’ve got to understand our place as consumers is very strong. But it is only strong if the stuff is there for us to choose.’ The latest challenge for the Bradshaw family has been to put together a family Christmas. The decorations have been ordered from a handmade crafts website, folksy.com, and they also found tinsel in South Wales. Meanwhile, a London business called The Christmas Forest sells British-grown trees. The Bradshaws have praised John Lewis and Waitrose for their efforts to back UK-made goods, and they provided British paper chains. A spokesperson for John Lewis said: ‘Last year we increased the number of UK suppliers by 57 per cent and we have set ourselves the target of increasing sales of UK-made products by 15 per cent by the end of 2015.’ The biggest problem was finding anything suitable for Lucan’s stocking. Emily says: ‘I wanted to buy Lucan some Stickle Bricks but you can’t get British ones any more.’ But at least one traditional Christmas present staple – the Airfix model –  is about to be made in Britain again after company owners Hornby reversed a decision made in the early 2000s to use factories in China. The only rule the Bradshaws set themselves was to buy products from British firms manufacturing in Britain, although they quickly realised the system made this difficult to stick to. James explains: ‘For every sector the term “manufacturing” means something different. ‘On a mug, for example, it may say “made in Britain” but it could have been made in China and then transfer printed in the UK.’ And in this global age they have had to make some compromises. The couple have maintained their Twitter account despite the fact it is an American company – and that has sometimes been crucial. Emily says: ‘There have been times where we have been looking for a British product and we’ve thought, “It doesn’t exist.”  Then you’ll get someone who tweets “Have you heard of…?” You click the link and there it is.’ James says it is up to retailers to take responsibility and back British manufacturers. ‘So far we have found that British-made stuff, like clothes, is good quality and can be produced at a price that can still make firms a profit. ‘The manufacturing is there and is growing. The responsibility rests with retailers to stock this stuff.’ So, as the experiment draws to a close, what will the Bradshaws do next? James says: ‘We always said we could end it if we wanted to but actually it feels less like an end and more we’re just setting out on this adventure. We will carry on – but probably won’t be quite so strict with ourselves – as we’ve found buying British works for us. ‘We are not out to tell others how to live, but we’d like to help others who want to Buy British too.’ Toilet paper: Waitrose own-brand toilet roll (and 90 per cent of Waitrose own-brand products) are made in Britain. Tea: The Bradshaws found an English tea grower, Tregothnan, right, in Cornwall. Tablet computer: The Zoostorm  tablet, some components made abroad,  but final manufacture takes place in Warrington, Cheshire. Lava lamp: The Mathmos lava lamp has been made in Britain since 1963. Digital music Player: The Media Box Touch MP3/4.  Made in Britain by MCH Media  of Hertfordshire, slogan: British Made Fun. Matches: The famous brand England’s Glory, right, is made in Sweden. Lightbulbs: None made in Britain. The family have survived on a handful of old bulbs. They will have to compromise in 2014. Tinned tomatoes: Emily bought fresh tomatoes and dried them for use out of season. Batteries: None are British made. Bradshaws have eked out supplies this year, but another compromise is looming. Printer Ink: None made in Britain – so the Bradshaws gave up printing from the computer. Rice: Obviously not grown in UK. A staple the family have gone without. Rubber gloves – Rubber is not grown in UK. Products are typically manufactured close to growers. Social media: Twitter, a thoroughly American company, has been essential to their campaign. Transport: James has bought a British-made Triumph motorbike.  But Emily still drives their Spanish car, a SEAT. They are considering a mini next year but their preferred model, the Countryman, is made  in Austria. Toys: Very hard to find British-made toys. Three-year-old Lucan’s favourite is a Thomas the Tank Engine – made in China.","James and Emily Bradshaw have been buying local for a year .

Ciarah Bennett has been told she will be scarred for life after the Pitbull-like dog clamped its jaws onto her leg and tried to bite her throat at a friend's house in Salford, Greater Manchester. The college student spent nine days in hospital and had a three-hour skin graft operation after she hid in a wardrobe, but the dog opened the door and jumped in with her. Mauled: Ciarah Bennett (right and left with her mother Chantel) hid in a wardrobe for 25 minutes to escape a pitbull-like dog . The attack was only stopped when a friend squeezed the dog's head and Ciarah yanked her leg out of its jaws. Ciarah, a student at Bury College, Greater Manchester, said: 'I was in the bedroom when it came running through and grabbed my leg. 'I thought I was going to die. I was crying and trying to fight back. I kept getting dragged to the floor. It was really strong. 'I was screaming ""help me, help me"". I got in the wardrobe but it got in with me and jumped up and got my arm. It dug its other paw in me and tried to get my throat. 'I got out of the wardrobe with the dog still on my arm and it dragged me by the leg again for another 10 minutes while I held on to the bed.' Ciarah was taken to North Manchester General Hospital, and later to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital where she underwent a three-hour skin graft operation on a deep wound to her right leg. Traumatic: Ciarah, 15, said: 'I thought I was going to die. I was crying and trying to fight back. I kept getting dragged to the floor. I got in the wardrobe but it got in with me and jumped up and got my arm' Terrified: The student with her mother Chantel, who said: 'This has had a big psychological impact on Ciarah' Banned: It is illegal to own, sell or give away pitbull terriers like the one pictured, with police cracking down on what they call dangerous dogs. The breed of dog which attacked Ciarah is not confirmed (file photo) She had suffered 20 bite marks across both legs, nerve damage to her right leg and bites to her right arm. Her right leg and arm are in plaster, she has to use crutches to walk and she will need physiotherapy. She added: 'I am still in a lot of pain and I have had a few nightmares since.' Her mother Chantel Bennett, 35, said: 'This has had a big psychological impact on Ciarah.' Certain breeds of dog are banned for their aggression in Britain, including Pitbull terriers, Japanese Tosas and Fila Brazilieros. The breed of dog involved in the attack on Ciarah has not been confirmed. Greater Manchester Police confirmed a pitbull type dog was seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act from a house on November 25.

A married teacher who had an affair with a pupil told police and colleagues she was in love with the schoolboy, a court has heard. Bernadette Smith engaged in ‘sexual activity’ with the ‘vulnerable’ 16-year-old, whom she had taught and also tutored after school. The relationship started in Smith’s classroom at Bannockburn High School, Stirling, where she confessed her feelings to the boy, before the pair went to a nearby park and had their first kiss. Court: Bernadette Smith, 35, told police she fell in love with the pupil she was having an affair with and planned to leave her husband to be with him . However, the teenager’s grandmother found out and told the school. Smith was then suspended on September 19. But that night, the mother-of-three visited the boy's home and the pair spent the night together in bed. Smith, 35, later told police that she had told her pupil’s father about her feelings for his son. Wearing a maroon dress and black cardigan, the history and English teacher appeared in the dock at Stirling Sheriff Court yesterday. Smith, of Denny, Stirlingshire, admitted a single charge that between September 13 and 20 this year, while in a position of trust, she engaged in sexual activity with the pupil, kissed him and lay beside him on a bed while partially clothed. Depute fiscal Ann Orr told the court that the pupil was ‘regarded as vulnerable’. She said that Smith had originally denied any physical contact had occurred when she was interviewed by headmaster Tom Black on September 19. However, she confirmed that they had met twice outside school. But when Mr Black interviewed the boy, he confirmed the pair had kissed. The police were informed and an investigation was launched. Mrs Orr said that in a text message to a colleague, Smith said that she was going to leave her husband and had fallen in love with the pupil. The teacher added that they wanted to be together. Mrs Orr added that Smith was detained by police after she arrived at the pupil’s house while they were interviewing him. The pair reportedly started their relationship in a classroom at Bannockburn High School in Stirling (pictured) The fiscal said: ‘In the course of her interview with police, she confirmed she had known the boy since he began at the school. ‘She said she knew of the problems in his family life. She said he was a caring boy who found it difficult to trust people. ‘She admitted that she met him on two occasions outside school and kissed him on the mouth and on the neck. ‘She also admitted meeting at his home and told his father about her feelings, and she stayed overnight in the boy’s bedroom and that she had been wearing her jeans and a bra.’ Mrs Orr added: ‘She said during the interview that she loved the boy and they both wanted to be together.’ The fiscal said that during the teenager’s interview, his feelings for her ‘were somewhat less clear’. Representing Smith, Andrew Gibb, solicitor for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union, asked for psychiatric reports to be carried out before sentencing. He added: ‘She has lost her career. She can’t any longer remain as a registered teacher. Mrs Smith for some bizarre reason had feelings for him (the boy). 'She was the one who was responsible for this. He was in no way to blame.’ Deferring sentence for a social work report, Sheriff William Gilchrist told Smith: ‘Your bail will continue, which includes the special condition of no contact with the boy.’ Stirling Sheriff Court (pictured) heard how the woman told a colleague she planned to leave her husband . At his home last night, the teenager said: ‘When it all happened I couldn’t believe it.

A festive family has spent thousands of pounds turning their home into their very own Santa's grotto. Grandfather-of-four Jim Cooper, 59, and his wife, 56, have been transforming their semi-detached house into a winter wonderland to celebrate Christmas for the last ten years. The entire building is covered from top to bottom in twinkling fairy lights while the front garden is full of illuminated Christmas-themed ornaments. Carol and Jim Cooper from West Moseley in Surrey, have spent the last 10 years transforming their home into a winter wonderland . The house and garden is covered in more than 40 sets of lights and there are at least 15 inflatables - including several life-sized Santas as well as a Winnie The Pooh and Tiger wearing Father Christmas outfits . Mr Cooper said: 'We love doing this every year and seeing the reactions of the children. 'Many insist on coming round every day to look at the house and a lot of adults love it too. We like to help get people in the Christmas spirit and have a bit of fun.' The house and garden is covered in more than 40 sets of lights and there are at least 15 inflatables - including several life-sized Santas as well as a Winnie The Pooh and Tiger wearing Father Christmas outfits. There is even a rotating Merry-Go-Round complete with elves swinging from Christmas candy canes. Another unique garden feature is an igloo with a snowman which leaps out at intervals before hiding back inside. But the finishing touch is a snow machine which pumps out dozens of litres of snow at the flick of a switch, blanketing the house and garden in West Molesey, Surrey, within minutes. Making use of CCTV they installed to ward of vandals, the couple catch unsuspecting passers-by by surprise, flicking the switch to start the snow-making machine, which douses their front garden with dozens of litres of snow . The incredible display has cost the couple more than £5,000 over the years - with each inflatable costing between £80 and £300 - and Mr and Mrs Cooper say they plan to continue adding to it . The couple first started decorating their home at the behest of their 32-year-old daughter Clare, who wanted to put up a decoration of Santa climbing up the side of the house . Mr Cooper said: 'We installed CCTV outside a few years ago after the display was vandalised - the inflatables were all cut with a knife. 'But we have quite a bit of fun with the CCTV now and turn on the snow machine when we spot someone on the camera coming near the house. 'People now think the snow machine has a sensor or something on it and we watch them on the little screen in our living room jumping up and down in front of the snow machine to try and get it to turn on. 'Then when they go to walk away we turn it on and they come running back. It's a lot of fun.' The incredible display has cost the couple more than £5,000 over the years - with each inflatable costing between £80 and £300 - and they plan to continue adding to it. But, perhaps fortunately for the couple, they don't know how much it costs them in electricity to run it. 'We pay a set amount by direct debit every month,' Mr Cooper explained. 'So we don't actually know how much it costs to run all the Christmas lights and the inflatables, which each have their own fans to keep them upright, as the electricity bill seems to even out over the year.' The inflatables’ fans are turned on at 9am so they can be seen throughout the day and the lights are switched on by a timer at 4pm every day. The couple turn everything off around 10pm. Mr Cooper and his wife, who have two children, first started decorating their home at the behest of their daughter Clare, 32, who wanted to put a decoration of Santa climbing up a ladder on the side of the house. It grew from there and the couple have been building up their Christmas decorations collection ever since. Mr Cooper, a father-of-two, said: 'A couple of years ago my daughter, who's just a big kid, wanted us to put this Santa on the side of the house. 'So at first we just had that one Santa but then we kept adding something every year until we decided seven years ago to go all out and turn it into a Christmas house. 'We try to get something new every year and move things round a bit to make it look a bit different. 'We also buy lots of light bulbs in bulk so we can replace any that break. The couple, who have four grandchildren, have dedicated this year's display to raising money for a local school for children with learning difficulties . Mr Cooper, a father-of-two, said: 'It does take quite a bit of work but we love doing it' 'It does take quite a bit of work but we love doing it. ‘ . It now takes the couple three days to set up display before the lights can be switched on December 1. The couple put on the lights every day over the Christmas period before they start taking it down on the weekend before January 6. Mr Cooper said: 'We like to make sure everything is ready for the lights to be switched on December 1 - to mark the start of Christmas. 'We set the counter on the front door which then runs down the days until Christmas Day.' The house has become an attraction for locals with many parents bringing their children by to see the spectacular display. Mr Cooper said: 'The kids absolutely . love it. We’ve had parents tell us the lights drive them mad because . their kids insist on being driven to see them every day until Christmas . is over. 'We also have groups from the Brownies and Rainbows and I dress up as Santa for them.' It takes the couple three days to set up display before the lights can be switched on December 1. They put the lights on every day over the festive period before dismantling the display on the weekend prior to January 6 . And after all their hard work keeping their Christmas display working all month, Mr and Mrs Cooper will be able to put their feet up on Christmas Day as a relative will be cooking the traditional turkey dinner. Mr Cooper added: 'It will be nice not to be the one waking up at 6am to put the turkey on this year. 'But we always have a big traditional, family celebration and this year will be no different. 'Christmas is our favourite time of year and we like to take the opportunity to bring a bit of happiness and Christmas spirit to our friends and neighbours. 'None of our neighbours have ever complained about the lights - just that they've sometimes struggled to park because so many people stop their cars to look our lights.'","Grandparents Jim and Carol Cooper have spent 10 years transforming their home into a winter wonderland .

Court: MIND director Nicholas Pennell stalked the woman for three months by following her in his white Audi, a court heard . A director of the mental health charity Mind stalked a woman he had met only once by following her in his white Audi for three months, a court heard. Nicholas Pennell, 62, followed the pretty 29-year-old woman on her way home from work three times a week, slowing down to see her and driving back to look at her again once he had passed. Pennell, who has resigned from his position at the charity, described the victim as 'charming and pleasant' after meeting her at her place of work. The woman began noticing the man's white Audi as she walked home from a park and ride near Plymouth, Devon. After changing her route home, Pennell continued to follow the woman who was also described as 'attentive and enchanting'. The victim noted the car's registration number and reported it to police after saying the ordeal was 'ruining the quality of her life'. Plymouth Crown Court heard Pennell was 'smitten' with the woman, but had no intentions of making contact with her. The 62-year-old said his work was stressful but sometimes boring, and he began . stalking her to 'brighten up his day' even though he knew it was . inappropriate. His lawyer Gareth Richardson told the court: 'He found her a very attentive, enchanting woman and became obsessed. 'He is mortified she was so adversely affected.' Pennell from Tavistock, Devon was chief executive of Plymouth and District Mind until his arrest in September. He admitted he had been following the victim for three months, but denied slowing down when he passed her in his car. The court heard how the defendant was 'relieved' to have been arrested as 'it had become an obsession'. Plymouth Crown Court heard how the man became infatuated with the victim he found to be 'enchanting and attentive' Mr Richardson said the man was receiving therapy and counselling, adding: 'He is still struggling to come to terms with this.' Judge Geoffrey Mercer said: 'He was infatuated. I am prepared to accept that you had no sinister intent towards this woman. 'You developed an infatuation to the extent of an obsession. It frightened her and caused her real distress.' He was given a community order to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work, pay £1,030 court costs and a token £200 compensation to the victim. A restraining order banning him from any contact was made without time limit. Pennell said afterwards: 'I am still shaking, I regret what has happened. 'I tendered my resignation which was accepted.'","Nicholas Pennell followed the 29-year-old in his car three times a week .

Shoppers stocking up on everything they need for a Christmas dinner face paying up to 28 per cent more than they did just three years ago. The price of turkeys, potatoes, cakes, wine and chocolates have risen several times faster than wages, hitting families in the pocket. Labour claimed the figures means there will be 'real worry' about the cost of celebrating this year, and accused the government of failing to boost wages as the economy recovers. Cost: There have been above inflation rises in the cost of poultry, potatoes and cakes since the election, while wages have risen by just 6 per cent . With just shopping 11 days left until Christmas, all of the big name supermarkets have launched campaigns claiming to offer the best deals. But figures compiled by Labour show how the price of festive favourites have risen dramatically. Poultry has soared by 14.6 per cent since May 2010, hitting anyone planning to serve traditional turkey on the big day. Even more alarmingly potatoes have soared by 28.1 per cent, more than double the rate of inflation of 12.7 per cent over the same period. However wages have risen by just 6 per cent since the election. Anyone with a sweet tooth will also feel the pinch, with biscuits and cakes up 21 per cent and sweets and chocolates 18.3 per cent more expensive. The cost of a Christmas tipple has also risen, with wine and spirits up 14.5 per cent. The figures also reveal that vegetables have risen by 7.2 per cent and beer 11.4 per cent, slower than the rate of inflation. Squeeze: This graph shows the increase in prices since May 2010 compared to the rise in wages, which means families are having to make their money go further . Most voters believe they would be no better off financially under a Labour government, polling has found. Around a third of voters - 32 per cent - think the opposition would leave them with less cash in their pockets while nearly the same amount - 31 per cent - said they would be 'much the same as I am today'. A quarter of adults believed they would have more money, the YouGov survey for The Sun found. Labour leader Ed Miliband's electoral strategy is based on the so-called 'cost of living crisis' and has included a pledge to cap energy bills for 20 months if he wins in 2015. According to the research, confidence in the party's ability to handle the economy is low, with 42 per cent believing it would be in a worse state if Labour had won last time. Overall the Conservatives are on 35 per cent, Labour on 39 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. Labour’s shadow cabinet minister Michael Dugher said: ‘David Cameron’s cost-of-Christmas crisis is hitting families up and down the country. ‘Out of touch ministers need to spend time around the kitchen tables of those paying bills or nervous about the Christmas shopping. ‘Families are £1,600 a year worse off under David Cameron and there is real worry this winter that the basics are unaffordable, treats are out of reach and better times out of sight. ‘What we need is a lasting recovery for all, based on job-creation, a freeze on energy bills and support for working families.’ He added: ‘Families should be able to celebrate without compromise at Christmas but the fact so many cannot celebrate as they wish this festive period only underlines the damage done by David Cameron’s government.’ The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was trying to reduce food prices. A spokesman said: 'Farming is now a global industry and is susceptible to the market when prices rise as well as when they fall. 'The Government is working to reduce price increases by opening up global markets and promoting competition in our own food and farming industries.' The government has been stung by criticism that despite a return to economic growth most people feel no better off. Wages have risen by a fraction of the increase in prices. But yesterday Chancellor George Osborne seized on figures from the Office for National Statistics showing that  average earnings were now keeping pace with inflation. He told the Commons Treasury Committee: ‘It shows that median gross weekly earnings are increasing at 2.2 per cent. 'That is, of course, the current rate of inflation. So I think that points to the broader argument that I have been making, which is that as the economy recovers, that is the route to a sustained increase in the living standards of the people who live in that economy, and you can't pretend that the two aren't connected, that you can have a living standards plan without an economy plan.’","Since the election poultry us up 14.6%, potatoes 28% and sweets 18.3% .

Payout: Merseyside PCSO Pauline Harrison has been awarded £4,000 after injuring herself while on duty . A police community support officer who injured her knee while investigating a burglary has been awarded £4,000 in compensation, it emerged last night. Pauline Harrison, 53, was responding to a 999 call reporting a break-in at a derelict school when she fell over a 3ft-high wooden fence. Yesterday it was revealed that the case had been settled out of court days before it was due to go before a judge. Sources said the settlement added up to around £4,000 – just £1,000 less than the maximum amount she could have claimed had the case gone to court. The incident happened in 2009 when the PCSO was called to Sunshine House, a former school for the blind, after reports that youths had been spotted on the roof of the four-storey building. Previously trespassers had set fire to part of the grounds, prompting the building’s owner – property development firm Lightflask Ltd – to secure the perimeter with a 6ft fence. The only gap in the perimeter fence was a small gateway at the front of the site which was secured with a 3ft wooden fence. Miss Harrison, who serves with Merseyside police, said she suffered ‘soft tissue damage’ to her right knee as she tried to leave the property in Birkdale, near Southport. In court papers, she claimed Lightflask Ltd was negligent because it had allowed the fence to become a ‘danger and a trap to persons lawfully entering and exiting the premises’. The former dog trainer said the company had failed to make the wooden fencing safe and failed to properly warn her about the fencing by erecting warning signs. Derelict: Ms Harrison was attending reports of a burglary at this former school in Birkdale when she tripped . Miss Harrison also claimed there was no adequate system of inspection or maintenance of the site. Police officers have sought huge sums for controversial claims. Among them are: . WPC Fiona Clark sued for £400,000. She hurt her back lifting boxes of stationery. WPC Kelly Jones demanded £50,000 from the owner of a petrol station where she tripped on the kerb during a call-out. Detective . Inspector Brian Baker won a £7,000 payout after he claimed exposure to . cannabis fumes made him snore and caused problems in his marriage. WPC Louise McGarva sued for £500,000 after claiming she developed a fear of sirens following a riot-training exercise. PC John Franklin won £108,000. He was injured by handcuffs on a safety course. WPC Lesley O’Shea sued for £200,000 after slipping on a banana skin. Last . night a spokesman for Lightflask Ltd said he was unable to  discuss . details of the case, which had been settled by the firm’s insurers and . is thought to include Miss Harrison’s £25 travelling expenses, £14 . prescription charges and £102 physiotherapy costs. However, he added that it  was ‘crazy’ that members of the public could be sued by police going about their duties. ‘Risks . cannot be removed from every situation,’ he said. ‘It’s crazy that . claims can be made by police officers in their line of work. 'The nature . of their job is risky, but they are there to protect the public.’ Miss Harrison’s decision to sue was also condemned by her own force when it was revealed last month. Chief . Superintendent Nikki Holland, of Merseyside Police, said the decision . to make a claim was ‘not a course of action that the force would . encourage or support’. And . earlier this year Home Secretary Theresa May criticised ‘frivolous’ claims being made by officers which she said were ‘not the sort of . attitude’ they should exhibit. Her . comments came after WPC Kelly Jones, 33, threatened to sue a garage . owner in Thetford, Norfolk, when she tripped over a kerb while . investigating a burglary. She later dropped her claim.","Pauline Harrison, 53, tripped over a fence outside abandoned building .

Brave: Guo Bin, affectionately known as Bin-Bin, has been successfully fitted with implants after his eyes were gouged out in August . A special send-off ceremony took place today where the child danced to music and even offered to leave his toys behind for other sick children to play with. When asked how he felt, he said: 'Very happy' before thanking everyone who had helped him. Police in the boy's hometown in northern China's Shanxi province say they suspect his aunt carried out the attack, although the boy's parents have expressed doubts. The woman has since committed suicide but the boy's DNA and blood were found on her clothes. Recovering: Six-year-old Guo Bin writing with the help of his mother and father . Going home: A special send-off ceremony took place today where the child danced to music before he left . Initial reports had said the corneas were missing when the boy's eyes were found, leading to speculation that his attacker was an organ trafficker, but police later ruled out organ sales as a motive saying the corneas had been found attached to the eyeballs. Police had offered a 100,000 yuan ($16,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the sole suspect. Reports said the little boy had been drugged before his eyeballs were gouged out. At the time Guo Bin's devastated father said: ‘We didn’t notice his eyes were gone when we discovered him – he had blood all over his face. We thought he had fallen down and smashed his face.’ Hope: Guo Bin has undergone surgery that could one day lead to the partial restoration of his eyesight . The boy was rushed to hospital where doctors were shocked to find his eyes had been removed. His father said: ‘His eyelids were turned inside out, and his eyeballs were not there.’But in three months Bin-Bin has made a remarkable recovery. The boy's mother said he can now put on his clothes, brush his teeth and climb stairs by himself, according to reports in Hong Kong media. She said: 'His adaptive ability is very strong and he's very smart'. Expert: Dr Dennis Lam volunteered to conduct the operations on the six-year-old free of charge . Implants: Guo Bin is accompanied by his mother Wang Wenli before undertaking the surgery . Horrific: The Chinese boy lies in hospital after he had his eyes gouged out . The brutal attack on the boy who has a cleft palate horrified the Chinese public and added to outrage over violence against children. He was given eye-socket implants in September to fill his empty sockets and been fitted with prosthetic eyes which gives the appearance of normal eyes. The authorities have said they will help Bin-Bin find a school and he will receive regular check-ups. In six-months the child will return to the hospital to change his eye pieces and will be given a special navigation device to help him get around day to day which will be fitted to his forehead and tongue. The device will capture images and translate them into electronic signals for his brain. *** .","Guo Bin has been fitted with implants at the C-MER Dennis Lam Eye Hospital .

Some 1,500 acid attacks are reported worldwide every year, according to . the London-based charity Acid Survivors Trust International. The group . says the actual figure is likely to be far higher because so many . victims are too scared to speak out. India has no official statistics on the matter, but reports of acid . attacks appear regularly in the media. Attackers often target the head . and face in order to maim, disfigure and blind their victims, often . because of spurned sexual advances. Laxmi, who volunteers with Mukherjee at the Indian private group Stop . Acid Attacks, said Indian law is failing women.

Now, she says, he is married and has a child. 'Where is justice? Where is the law? Nowhere,' she said.

She said she struggled with her identity for years after the attack, at . one point even asking the courts to allow her to commit suicide. Euthanasia is illegal in India and her plea was rejected. But now, Mukherjee says she is coming to terms with her future, and is bolder about appearing in public and telling her story. 'I have been saying this to myself, ""Why should I feel ashamed?

An underage worker has died after working '12 hours a day, six days a week' at an iPhone factory in China, it emerged today. The 15-year-old - whose papers said he was 20 - suffered a fatal case of pneumonia after working for one month, said reports. Shi Zhaokun was employed by Pegatron, a Taiwanese manufacturing company that produces the iPhone 5C on the Chinese mainland. A 15-year-old boy has died of pneumonia after working for a month building iPhone 5s . But his family say on October 9 Mr Shi couldn't make it to work and checked into a hospital. Soon after, he was pronounced dead. His family claim Mr Shi worked 79 hours in his first . week, 77 in his second and 75 in his third, all apparently in violation . of the law. Pegatron denies that the boy's death was related to his work schedule, the New York Times reported, but admitted several other young workers have died in the last few months. Under Chinese law, at 15 Mr Shi was too young to work on a factory floor. Labour rights activists in China have claimed there must be some connection between recent deaths and factory working conditions. Li Qiang, head of China Labor Watch, told the New York Times: 'Considering the sudden deaths of five people and the similar reason of the deaths, we believe there should be some relations between the tragedy and the working conditions in the factory.' Production line: Chinese workers assemble electronic components at the Taiwanese technology giant Foxconn's factory in Shenzhen . A series of scandals have dogged Apple's supply chain in recent years. Last year the iPhone maker . vowed to clean up its supply chain after a string of suicides and riots . at Chinese assembly plants owned by Foxconn. Apple then handed some of its lucrative assembly contracts to Pegatron and was hoping to put its scandal-hit image behind it. But a damning report in July from China Labour Watch said conditions at three Apple factories run by Pegatron were 'worse than at Foxconn'. Scandal-hit: Workers are seen inside a Foxconn factory in the township of Longhua in the southern Guangdong province . A five-month undercover investigation found Apple's supplier broke 86 laws and regulations, with workers forced to do 70 hour weeks and more than 100,000 underage staff working on the production lines. To meet the soaring demand for Apple's devices, Pegatron had increased its 100,000-strong workforce by up to 40 per cent this year. But conditions at its plants were so bad that one in four workers abandoned their jobs in the space of just two weeks, the report said. Apple said the report 'contains claims that are new to us and we will investigate them immediately'. Apple did not provide an official comment on the latest allegations surrounding Mr Shi. But in its 'Supplier Responsibility Progress Report', Apple states: 'For the past seven years, Apple has been publishing reports on the audits we perform in our supply chain. 'We do this because we believe in honestly sharing our findings — the good and the bad. We’re fixing problems and tackling issues that our entire industry faces, such as excessive work hours and underage labor. 'We’re going deeper into the supply chain than any other company we know of, and we’re reporting at a level of detail that is unparalleled in our industry. It continues: 'To end the practice of excessive overtime, we now track weekly work hours for one million workers across our supply chain and publish the results on our website every month. 'And we share our work-hour strategy and tools with others inside and outside our industry. Although underage labor is rare in our supply chain, we report all incidents we find, as well as the actions taken to correct problems and prevent future occurrences.'","The 15-year-old died of pneumonia after working for a month .

Britain's stay-at-home mothers feel under twice as much financial pressure as those in Europe, research has found. The findings will be seen as a damning indictment of British policy, which offers little relief to women who choose to look after their children full-time. Their numbers are now at an all-time low, plunging by nearly 50,000 in the country last year alone. Critics say the Government has made the situation worse by reducing child benefit and tax credits, and instead choosing to back working mothers. Tom, 38 and Erika Birch, 30, and their children Jackson, two and seven-year-old Maddie at home in Bath. Mr Birch, whose wife stays at home to care for their children, said it is 'ridiculous' they do not get more support from the government . The new paper, published in the European Sociological Review, finds that British women who do not work feel far less secure than their counterparts in Europe. Researchers tracked the fortunes of more than 36,000 women in five countries, including the UK. Women in France, Italy and Ireland who chose not to work were twice as likely to be ‘financially satisfied’, compared with those in Britain. The paper concluded that commitment to family is more important than careers to women across the continent. Most other European countries encourage women to take time out of their careers to look after their children. In Germany, the government pays parents up to £1,520 a month to do so, in ‘compensation’ for lost earnings. Campaign group Mothers At Home Matter said the study shows that motherhood is undervalued in Britain. Its secretary, Lynne Burnham, said: ‘We really have lost something as a society in Britain when motherhood is denigrated and the traditional family unit means far less than in countries on the continent.’ The study drew on surveys carried out between 1994 and 2001,  which asked women to rate their financial satisfaction on a scale of one to six. Researchers found that full-time employment tended to give women the best sense of security, but a large salary was not the only key to contentment. In France, Italy and Ireland, homemakers felt just as financially satisfied as those in full-time work. But the same phenomenon could not be seen in the UK,  which had the unhappiest homemakers. The paper, by researchers at Italy’s University of Trento, said: ‘It seems that for Italy, France, and Ireland, being a committed housewife is practically equivalent to being continuously employed. In Denmark and the United Kingdom, however, the same association is not found.’ David Cameron has come under pressure to introduce transferable tax allowances that would mean a full-time mother could give her income tax-free allowance to a working father . Tom Birch, whose wife Erika stays at home and looks after their two children Maddie, two, and four-year-old Jackson, said it was ‘ridiculous’ that they did not get more support from the Government. The 40-year-old from Bath, a senior manager at a financial services company, added: ‘We pay tax and National Insurance and she should be getting all the benefits a person on a low income is getting.’ David Cameron has come under pressure to introduce transferable tax allowances that would mean a full-time mother could give her income tax-free allowance to a working father. A limited version for some married couples is due to begin in 2015, but will be worth only £3.85 a week at most. Families in which both parents work, meanwhile, have been given up to £1,200 a year for each child to help with childcare costs. Mrs Burnham said: ‘In government and policy circles, motherhood quite simply doesn’t matter.’ A Government spokesman said: ‘Stay-at-home parents are an important part of life in Britain. We have recognised their contribution properly for the first time in the state pension system as we move to a single-tier pension and will recognise marriage in the tax system.’","Research was published in the European Sociological Review .

Ed Balls was derided last week for his red-faced and shouted response to the Autumn Statement, as Labour MPs criticised his performance as one of the worst they have seen in the House of Commons. And today, the shadow chancellor lived up to his nickname of ‘Red Ed’ as he appeared in the Commons dressed as Father Christmas for a vote on the Government’s banking reform Bill. Mr Balls, 46, arrived in the chamber in a full Santa outfit, complete with boots, red hood and what looked like a pillow stuffed under his coat to make him fatter. Santa: Pamela Nash, Labour MP for Airdrie and Shotts, posted this photograph on Twitter of herself with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls in the House of Commons lobby . Christmas spirit: Garry Blachere, of Christmas lights company Blachere UK, posted this picture of Mr Balls as he fulfilled his annual duty at the Commons Christmas party for the children of MPs and parliamentary staff . Fellow Labour colleagues Barry Gardiner, MP for Brent North, and Yasmin Qureshi, MP for Bolton South East, were seen patting the shadow chancellor’s stomach. They voted on Labour proposals to bring forward a cap on payday lenders from January 2015 to next October. The Labour amendments to the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill, both of which were defeated, would have also forced lenders to share information about customers to stop people taking out multiple loans. The dress code for MPs in the Commons is strict, especially for men. They must wear a jacket and tie at all times, except when there are votes. They are then allowed to pop into the voting lobbies in less formal attire. It has been known with late night votes for some MPs to be wearing their gym kit but this is the first time it is believed an MP has appeared in the Commons dressed as Santa. Stuart Andrew, Conservative MP for Pudsey, Horsforth & Aireborough, said on Twitter: 'Seen it all now. Division in the Commons and Ed Balls has dressed for the occasion....as Santa!' Costume change: Mr Balls (left) was pictured in the Commons earlier today with Labour party leader Ed Miliband listening during Prime Minister's Questions . Lampooned: Last week Mr Balls was ribbed online after his speech in response to the Autumn Statement which led to his name trending on Twitter and people using the #RedEd hashtag .

Proceeds from the party are going to the charity World Vision, which supports children’s education in Africa. Mr Vaz said: ‘This party is without doubt one of the most popular of the year. ‘Children of MPs and staff are coming together for an afternoon of fun. It is a chance for MPs and staff to bond with their kids and to support a good cause.’","Ed Balls dresses as Santa for vote on Government's banking reform Bill .

They were hailed as the future of environmentally friendly motoring and millions of pounds of tax payer subsidies were spent enrolling them - but the electric car has failed to spark any enthusiasm for drivers. Out of a total of 1,392 installed on London streets, just 349 charging points were used between July and September. Installed at a cost of £8.3 million, 75 per cent failed to attract a single driver, latest figures released under a Freedom of Information request revealed. Out of a total of 1,392 installed on London streets, just 349 charging points were used between July and September . There are 8,600 publicly funded charging points across the UK, The Times reported, but only 16,546 electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles registered in the country. Critics have called on the Government to make more efficient carbon savings by investing in infrastructure and projects that encourage walking or cycling. The Government has invested £16 million on electric car infrastructure in Britain. The information followed a FoI request by Stephen Knight, environment spokesman for the Lib Dems in the London Assembly. Installed at a cost of £8.3 million, 75 per cent failed to attract a single driver . Nick Fairholme, TfL's director responsible for electric vehicles, told The Times: 'Since its launch, nearly 1,400 publicly accessible charging points have been installed across the capital as part of the Source London scheme, making it Europe's largest charging network. 'We have focused on putting in the infrastructure so that motorists know there is somewhere convenient to recharge their vehicle and ensure there is capacity as electric vehicle use becomes more commonplace.' Despite Britain's car industry being on track for a record year, sales of ‘green’ cars remain slow. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders revised its forecast for 2013 from 2.22 million new car registrations to 2.25 million, representing a 10 per cent rise. A spokesman said: ‘The figures for the last few months have been really encouraging and we expect that to continue.’ Sales of ‘green’ cars – electric and hybrid – account for just 1.5 per cent of the market, but this is set to grow as prices fall. Total sales of alternative-fuel vehicles were 2,952 in October 2013, compared with overall car sales of 157,314. Sales in the first ten months of 2013 of ‘green’ cars were 28,124, up from 24,266 for the same period in 2012, with total car sales to date topping 1.95million. In sharp contrast to the overall growing British market, the European car industry is down 5 per cent on last year, although there have been signs of recovery as consumer confidence rises.","FoI reveals 349 of 1,392 charging points used between July and September .

Attackers targeted British tourists in Kenya in a grenade attack in Kenya this morning, but the explosive failed to explode. The assailants quickly fled after hurling the grenade at a minibus carrying the tourists as it drove through the Likoni district of Mombasa, Kenya's main port city. The grenade struck the vehicle's window but bounced off before landing on the ground without exploding, in a rare attack specifically targeting travellers in Kenya. Faulty: The grenade which was hurled at the van lies on the ground shortly before being detonated by police . The tourists had been travelling by . road from the Indian Ocean coastal resort of Diani to Mombasa, a mainly . Muslim region whose white-sand beaches are popular with tourists but . which is troubled by religious tensions. Robert Kitur, the city's police chief, said: 'The grenade was detonated safely by experts. 'We are investigating the incident and looking for the man who threw the grenade at the tourists and fled.' The Foreign Office said it was . urgently looking into the reports that a number of British travellers . had escaped the attack near Mombasa after the grenade failed to explode. Police told the Kenyan-based Standard Digital that the van was slowing down as the assailant flung a grenade . at it. 'He vanished soon after he hurled the explosive,' Chief Kitur . told Standard Digital. After the Russian-made explosive . failed to explode the driver of the minivan sped to a nearby police . station and reported the attack. Police subsequently attended the scene, cordoned off the area and detonated the device in a controlled explosion. Detonation: After police were alerted police sealed of the area and an expert from Mombasa police's bomb disposal unit, left, detonated the faulty Russian hand grenade with a controlled explosion, right . The tourists meanwhile continued on . their way to a wildlife safari at one of Kenya's world famous national . parks. Tourism is a key multi-million earner of foreign currency for . Kenya. The British High Commission in Kenya . said it was 'aware of a failed grenade attack on a vehicle near . Mombasa', adding they were 'looking into whether any British nationals . were involved and stand ready to provide consular assistance if needed'. The attack came as Kenya celebrates its 50 years of independence from former colonial rulers Britain. Kenya has seen a wave of grenade . attacks since its forces invaded southern Somalia in October 2011 to . help oust Al Qaeda-linked insurgents from the militant group al-Shabaab. Home-grown groups including the . Islamist Al-Hijra group, a radical organisation formerly known as the . Muslim Youth Centre, operate on Kenya's coast and have been linked to . al-Shabaab. Several radical Muslim preachers have . been assassinated in Mombasa sparking riots by their supporters, who . have accused the police of carrying out the killings, claims they . strongly deny. Grenades have been hurled into . restaurants in Mombasa and crowded areas in the capital Nairobi, as well . as a string of attacks in the remote northeast region bordering . Somalia. Al-Shabaab also claimed the brutal . September assault on Nairobi's upmarket Westgate mall, a centre popular . with foreigners, in which at least 67 people died in a four-day siege. Mombasa's Old Harbour: Security was strengthened in the coastal city after the grenade was hurled at a minibus carrying two Britons as it drove through the Likoni area, local police said . A map shows the location of Likoni, a southern district of Mombasa on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast . However, grenade attacks have in the past rarely targeted tourists.

But it seems that Kate Moss is keen to prove critics wrong. This year alone the 39-year-old supermodel has fronted campaigns for St Tropez, posed nude for Playboy and even designed a phone accessories collection for Carphone Warehouse. But it seems there is still no stopping Mossy as she lands yet another campaign - this time as the face of ELEVENPARIS' SS14 campaign. She's back! Kate Moss has been announced as the new face of ELEVENPARIS' SS14 collection . Following on from the brand's former campaign stars such as rockstar Lenny Kravitz, the godfather of punk Iggy Pop, and It-girls Daisy Lowe, Charlotte Free and Sky Ferreira, French fashion label has added the supermodel to its roster. Shot by renowned fashion photographer Craig McDean who has worked with the likes of Yves Saint Laurent and Christian Dior, the campaign features Kate in a series of portraits that are designed to present the brand’s new 90s inspired collection. She wears her hair scraped back, minimal make-up and some rock chic gold talon nails. The range aims to cross the border between grunge and sports chic, a look that Kate pulls off with ease. Grunge girl: The collection is 90s inspired and Kate pulls off the look with aplomb . Dan Cohen, co-founder of ELEVENPARIS, said: 'For us, Kate Moss was a natural choice to be the new face of the brand. 'Her unique style and her own close relationships with the music industry perfectly sum up what we always try to convey through our collections.' From Rimmel's new beauty campaign to her Carphone Warehouse collection, the Kate effect shows no sign of abating. PZ Cussons, the consumer goods giant, paid her six figures this summer to advertise . St Tropez, and it seems that the supermodel of the century is worth it. The fake tan became the company’s best-selling brand with revenues up 4 per cent for the six months to November 30. Dazzling: Last month, Kate Moss was announced as the star of Rimmel's new beauty campaign and rocked a futuristic look . Maria Malone, Senior Lecturer fashion business expert at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: 'When Kate Moss first appeared in magazines, she was a quirky antidote to the long legged doe eyed, perfect in every way type models that consumers were previously bombarded with. 'Kate is unique and distinct in appearance preventing look- a- likes and making her stand out from the usual cloned models. 'She has a natural ""imperfect"" yet unmistakable beauty which makes women relate to her and men believe her to be a more approachable girl next door than the unobtainable supermodels of old. Bug bucks: St. Tropez paid Kate six figures this summer to advertise St Tropez and it did wonders for their sales . 'The shelf life of a model is short, but Kate Moss is more than a model she is a brand, a British brand. 'All good brands provide a security in the purchase; you have bought the right thing. Age and time only adds strength to the brand. This will ensure that while other models retire when the inevitable wrinkles start to appear; the brand KM continues to grow.

Turkmenistan’s dictator Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov. Born in 1957 to a Tutsi family in southern Rwanda, Paul Kagame fled to Uganda at the age of just two when the Rwandan revolution ended Tutsi political dominance. After growing up in Ugunda, Kagame joined the Ugandan army and then the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) which invaded Rwanda in 1990 in an attempt to defeat the Hutu-led government. This began the Rwandan civil war, between the Hutu regime and the RPF. When the head of the RPF died early on in the war, Kagame took over, and by 1993 the RPF controlled significant areas of Rwanda and a ceasefire was negotiated.  But in April 1994, the Hutu president Habyariman was assassinated when his plane was shot down, igniting ethnic tensions which began the Rwandan genocide.

Paul Kagame was rumoured to have orchestrated the assassination, but he always denied having anything to do with it. paul kagame . A 2006 report by French judges Jean-Louis Bruguiere concluded that Kagame was to blame and called for him to be prosecuted, but he was immune from prosecution thanks to his position as head of state. A subsequent report, led by French judge Marc Trevidic, last year cleared Kagame and his regime of any involvement. Whoever caused the plane to crash, it sparked a wave of mass killings and in little over three months, Rwandan Hutus killed between 500,000 and 1million ethnic Tutsis, roughly 20 per cent of the population. In July 1994 Kagame ended the genocide with a military victory over the Hutus, and served as the country's vice president and minister of defence until he took over as President in 2000. Under his rule the country has prospered, and he has fostered links with the West, particularly Britain and the US, who believe he has spent aid money more sensibly than other African leaders. With Clinton: Kagame is favoured by western leaders who believe he spends aid more wisely than others . Kagame positions himself as forward-thinking - he has his own Twitter account, website and Facebook page among others - but is quick to stamp out opposition . But despite the clean-cut image he is keen to project, Kagame is dogged by suggestions his regime has funded the M23 rebels fighting the government in neighbouring Congo.  M23 insurgents have driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homes as they seized territory in the east of the country. A leaked United Nations report said Rwanda's leaders - including Kagame - could face prosecution for 'aiding and abetting' groups responsible for atrocties committed there. Stephen Rapp, from the US Office of Global Criminal Justice, said the evidence by the UN group of experts of Rwandan government support for M23 and other armed groups, including sending weapons and troops into the DRC, exposed Kagame and other senior officials to investigation for war crimes. President since 2000, Kagame has been accused of funding rebel fighters in neighbouring Congo . The militia, led by alleged war criminal Bosco Ntaganda, is accused of widespread murder and rape and has driven 470,000 people from their homes last year. The UN report said the Rwandan government gave 'direct assistance in the creation of M23 through the transport of weapons and soldiers through Rwandan territory', and recruited Rwandan youths, demobilised ex-combatants and Congolese refugees as M23 fighters.

If you're struggling to find a Christmas present for an avid Beatles fan, look no further. Apple, the company set up by John, Paul, George and Ringo, is set to release a new 59-track album next week, just in time for the festive season - and it's all thanks to EU copyright laws. Although it will not include some of the more fabled Beatles recordings - such as Carnival Of Light, or a 28-minute version of Helter Skelter - Beatles enthusiasts will no doubt be excited by the prospect of alternate versions of early classic such as A Taste Of Honey and She Loves You. A new 59-track album of Beatles material is to be released by Apple next week - thanks to EU copyright laws . The new release will include 44 songs recorded for the BBC as well as previously unreleased studio outtakes . The release has been prompted by copyright laws, which mean that unreleased music loses its copyright – and can therefore be taken for free and even sold by others – after 50 years. The album, to be released next Tuesday by Universal Music, will include performances recorded for the BBC and studio outtakes. The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963 will also include demonstration recordings of two songs that the band eventually gave to other artists. This will see Lennon and McCartney's Bad To Me, which became a number one hit for The Dakotas, and Lennon’s piano demo of I’m In Love, released by the same band, available on iTunes. BBC sessions of familiar songs such as From Me To You and I Saw Her Standing There, all made half a century ago, are included on the track list, which has appeared on Norwegian-based Beatles blog, WogBlog. The website, which reported the release, suggested that the collection is an effort to give the material copyright protection and stop it falling into the public domain. Last month, after campaigning led by Sir Cliff Richard, the UK government backed an extension to EU copyright laws. This means that the copyright on released music recordings has been extended to last from 50 years to 70 years. However, the copyright for non-released music recordings remains at 50 years. This, . Beatles fans believe, is why Apple has decided to release this bootleg . album of 1963 recordings - shortly before the tracks' copyright would . expire. The tracks would only be given protection following an official release. This latest batch of tracks comes little over a month after a selection of recordings from archive BBC sessions hit the shelves. The new selection includes multiple appearances for some tracks (there are three different takes of There's A Place, for example). For music recordings, EU copyright . laws were last month extended from 50 to 70 years’ protection, but this . does not include unreleased tracks. Therefore, unreleased Beatles recordings from 1963 will legally lose their copyright in 2014. It . means that Beatles fans can hope for releases of the 28-minute Helter . Skelter and their famous performance of Carnival Of Light from 1967 in . the next few years. The releases of previously unsold music could become a trend, thanks to the EU copyright law. Last year, for instance, Sony released an 86-song Bob Dylan album, shamelessly entitled The Copyright Extension Collection Vol 1. This was then followed up by the release of The 50th Anniversary Collection: 1963. The release is believed to have been brought about because copyright on unreleased music expires after 50 years . The album is to be released next Tuesday by Universal Music and will be available on iTunes only . The new album will include 44 recordings from 275 live performances for the BBC, all in 1963. In addition, there will be four versions of She Loves You and three of There's A Place. Of the five versions of A Taste Of Honey, one was recorded for the BBC's Easy Beat, two for Pop Go The Beatles and one for Side By Side. Beatles blogger Roger Stormo said on his blog, WogBlog: 'With the new release, Apple and Universal Music are saying that they now want to make money from this kind of material. 'But more importantly, the stuff they are still keeping in the vaults must now still be stuff they don't want to profit from, and bootlegging of that material could still be defended morally.'","The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963 includes five versions of A Taste Of Honey and four of She Loves You .

"By . Peter Campbell . PUBLISHED: . 19:40 EST, 12 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:10 EST, 12 December 2013 . Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls claimed last week that Britain's families are in the grip of a crisis . Standards of living in Britain have climbed to among the best in Europe – despite claims by Labour that the UK still faces a ‘cost of living crisis’. Families now enjoy the sixth highest quality of life in the EU due to a steadily recovering economy since David Cameron came to power, official figures showed yesterday. The UK is now tied with Denmark and France in the living standards league table – ahead of Belgium and the Netherlands. The figures, recorded by the Office for National Statistics, fly in the face of claims by Labour that Britain’s families are in the grip of a crisis. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls last week said that ‘for most people there is no recovery at all’ and accused the government of having ‘no real action’ to raise living standards. Amid jeering, he said Britain was experiencing ‘the slowest recovery for over 100 years’. Ed Miliband this week accused the Prime Minister of being ‘utterly complacent’ and ‘in denial’ about the rising cost of living – only to be told by Mr Cameron that Britain now has one of the fastest rates of growth among Western economies. And despite fears by critics that the economic recovery is not trickling down to ordinary families, George Osborne said ‘Britain’s economic plan is working’ amid the doubling of economic growth forecasts. The figures, compiled by statistics agency Eurostat, show that living standards have improved since 2011. Luxembourg, a tiny nation of only half a million people, tops the list and is followed by  Germany, which has seen its economy and exports boosted by the single currency. In 2011, when its economy was still in the doldrums, Britain was tied with Belgium in seventh place, and lagging behind France. But the French, under socialist president Francois  Hollande, have seen their standard of living flatline – while Britain has climbed. The quality of life table compiled by the Office for National Statistics reveals the UK economy is steadily improving . Life in the UK is now 14 per cent better than the average across the 28 EU member states, according to the figures. The worst countries are Bulgaria – where living standards are 51 per cent worse than the average – and Romania, where they are 50 per cent lower. Norway and Sweden, which are not members of the EU, also enjoyed living standards that were well above the EU average. The ONS said: ‘In 2012 the standard of living in the UK was joint sixth highest in the EU with France and Denmark, up one place from last year.’ Its measurements include goods and services consumed by individuals, as well as other benefits from living in the UK such as free healthcare and education. The figures relate to 2012, but are likely to have increased  further this year as the economic recovery takes hold. Last week the Government’s independent forecaster said the economy will grow at 1.4 per cent this year – almost twice as fast as previously expected. The Office of Budget Responsibility also upgraded the outlook for next year from 1.8 per cent to 2.3 per cent. Both unemployment and inflation have also dropped. Mr Miliband has pledged to freeze energy prices if Labour wins power at the next election, in a move described as ‘economic vandalism’ and widely derided by industry experts. But in last week’s Autumn Statement, the Chancellor said Labour had been proved ‘comprehensively wrong’ in demanding an end to austerity and said the annual deficit would be eliminated by 2018. n The pay gap between men and women has widened for the first time in five years, figures reveal. The difference in wages is now 10 per cent – up from 9.5 per cent in a year. Full-time male workers now get an average of £13.60 per hour, while a woman is paid only £12.24, said the Office for National Statistics.","Figures released by the Office for National Statistics give weight to Chancellor George Osbourne's claim that the 'economic plan is working'

All migrants will have to  demonstrate a ‘reasonable standard of English’ or be barred from claiming benefits, says Iain Duncan Smith. The Work and Pensions Secretary  announced that tests applied to those who end up claiming any work-related welfare payments will be tightened. For the first time, migrants are to be quizzed about their language skills to determine whether these are likely  to prove a barrier to them finding employment. Ian Duncan Smith has vowed to tighten up the standard of English required for migrants . In order to pass the more rigorous test, they will have to answer up to 100 new individually-tailored questions, and submit more evidence before they will be allowed to make a claim. The Department for Work and Pensions said that, for the first time, migrants will be quizzed about what efforts they have made to find work before coming to the UK and whether their English language abilities are likely to affect their chances of employment. The Work and Pensions Secretary announced that tests applying to welfare payments would be tightened . Migrants are entitled to benefits only if they can prove that they are legally allowed to be here and have sufficient ties to this country to show they are ‘habitually resident’. Mr Duncan Smith said a more robust system was being introduced in job centres across England, Scotland and Wales this week – and vowed to fight attempts by Brussels to overturn elements of the UK’s existing controls. ‘It is only right that we expect migrants to have a reasonable standard of English if they are to get and keep a job, and participate fully in British society,’ he told the Daily Mail. ‘It is absolutely right that we have strict rules in place to  protect the British benefits system from abuse. ‘That’s why we strengthened the habitual residence test [of eligibility to benefits]. The European Commission don’t like it – and even want to take us to court over the test. I am determined to fight that court action, believing that the test is not only legal, but vital. ‘While language skills form only one element of the habitual residence test, I believe they are a crucial indicator of migrants’ commitment to playing a full role in contributing to this country. ‘The British public are rightly concerned that migrants should contribute to this country, and not be drawn here by the attractiveness of our benefits system. We are taking action to ensure that that is the case.’ The latest figures show more than 5.6million people are claiming working-age benefits. Of these, 397,000 – or 7 per cent – are thought to have been non-UK nationals when they first registered for a national insurance number. This is an increase of more than 100,000 since 2008. Under the tightened system, migrants must provide more comprehensive evidence at the point of making a claim. This might include what measures they have taken to establish themselves in the UK, their housing and family situation, or what ties they still have abroad. They will also have to provide more evidence that they are doing everything they can to find a job, said Mr Duncan Smith. Iain Duncan Smith has said that all migrants must pass and English test before they are allowed to claim benefits .","Ian Duncan Smith has vowed to tighten up the standard of English required .

The 68-year-old had seen doctors complaining of swelling caused by fluid retention in the legs - and shortness of breath.

A Japanese man who had veins protruding from his chest was diagnosed with Behçet's disease, a rare and poorly understood condition that causes swelling of the blood vessels . When doctors at the National Defense Medical College in Saitama, examined him, they found varices - rough, dliated veins - of the chest and abdominal wall. Varicose veins in the legs also fall under the umbrella term of varices. These had been caused by an obstruction of the superior vena cava (SVC) - a large vein that carries blood from the body straight to the heart. It lies in the middle of the chest, behind the breast bone. Superior vena cava obstruction (SVCO) occurs when something blocks the blood from flowing along the SVC. The walls of the SVC are thin, meaning they easily become squashed. A CT scan of his chest also revealed a dilated inferior vena cava- the vein that carries blood from the lower body to the heart - and a heart condition which meant the heart is restricted from stretching and filling with blood properly.

With temperatures as high as 13C in some parts of the country, the weather is unseasonably warm for this time of the year when temperatures are expected to stay between 7C and 9C. Though warnings of high winds and gales covered Scotland and Northern Ireland, a Met Office guide revealed there was little to anticipate in most parts of England. Meteorologist Leon Brown, of the Weather Channel, said: 'It's not going to be a white Christmas, but it will be wet, windy and stormy. 'We'll be in the firing line next week, and over Christmas, for anything developing from the Atlantic.' Pressure from the jet stream — air currents that act as a barrier between warm and cold weather — will fall south of the UK this weekend, bringing rain and high winds with gusts of up to 80 mph in the north. Heavy rain is then likely to drift south. The chance of snow on Christmas day is slim in most parts of England while Scots' hopes of a white Christmas remain relatively in tact . A Met Office spokesman said: 'We are . moving into unsettled weather, with deepening low pressure and gale . force winds.

Teesdale in Cumbria was blanketed by heavy snow in November but is less likely to see a white Christmas like the rest of the country . There have been 38 snowy Christmas days in the past 52 years,with 1961 seeing the most snow on ground after 2010 and 2009. According to the Met Office, snow only falls on average five days in December, compared to 7.6 days in January, 6.8 days in February and six days in March. White Christmases were more frequent in the 18th and 19th centuries, even more so before the change of calendar in 1752 which effectively brought Christmas day back by 12 days. Climate change has also brought higher average temperatures over land and sea and this generally reduces the chances of snow during the festive period. Parts of the country were blanketed by unexpected snowfall in early November, when Arctic blasts plummeted temperatures down to as low as -4C.","Odds of snow on Christmas day as high as 10-1 in some parts of country .

Britain is set to be battered by a new freak weather system that could bring 100mph winds and blizzards in the run up to Christmas, forecasters say. A so-called Storm Emily could wreak havoc across much of the UK beginning from the middle of next week, potentially toppling trees and tearing off roof tiles. Weather Channel forecasters are naming the storm after Wuthering Heights author Emily Bronte, who died 165 years ago next Thursday - the day the storm is expected to strike. Scroll down for video .

Meanwhile, the Met Office has issued a Yellow Warning for northern and western parts of the UK tonight, including Scotland and Northern Ireland, advising of possible travel disruption in those regions. And looking forward to next week there is the chance that potentially strong winds could spread south and east, battering areas still recovering from the worst tidal floods for six decades. The unsettled weather is being caused by several low pressure systems sweeping across the north Atlantic, between the British Isles and Iceland. Poor visibility: This week parts of Britain were enveloped by a thick blanket of fog. Until Thursday though most of the South can expect mild south-westerly winds and temperatures of up to 14C .

But by Thursday there is the potential for strong winds to spread south and east, perhaps picking up to gale force around coastal areas. It could bring fresh misery for people there after last week two people died and thousands were evacuated from their homes after that region was swamped by a record-breaking tidal surge. Weather Channel meteorologist Leon Brown told the Daily Mirror: 'From Thursday to Christmas there is a high risk of gales. 'At the moment there is a 30 to 40 per cent risk of severe gales for central and southern Britain on Thursday. 'Worst case is 70 to 90mph gusts across exposed parts of Wales and the south, but even 70mph gusts for central Britain would cause a lot of disruption.'

Microsoft is announcing its next-generation Xbox model - Xbox One - at a launch event in Washington - and revealed there will be a television series based on its first person shooter Halo. Steven Spielberg announced the new TV series based on the Xbox exclusive's sci-fi action series. A 2013 release was also confirmed, though no exact date was given. Rumours suggest that the company could introduce single-code activations for games that would effectively lock games to this new console. This means gamers will no longer be able to lend second-hand games to friends, trade them in, or sell them on. Scroll down to video . Coming to television: The Halo series of games is one of Xbox's biggest exclusive franchises, and will now be turned into a TV series . According to research by VoucherCodes.co.uk 75% of gamers will upgrade to the Xbox One . 56% of users are hoping the new console has 4K resolution. The study also found that one in four gamers are hoping Microsoft will launch the IllumiRoom feature following the uncertainty surrounding whether the projection capability will be linked to the new console. Earlier this year, Microsoft limited the use and sharing of Microsoft Office codes in a similar way, but later back tracked after customer complaints. Other rumours around tonight's event in Redmond include the addition of a faster processor, improved speech recognition, Skype built-in, Smart Glass, IllumiRoom and more. There are even rumours circulating that Microsoft may announce two new models - one high-specification model and another cheap, lower-specification model. When the Xbox 360 was announced eight years ago, Microsoft also launched an update to its Xbox Live service to allow users to download games and get more features when playing other online players. Tonight's announcement is likely to include a similar update, which include the reports that Microsoft may soon introduce code activations for games. Microsoft may be heading towards a digital-only model with these plans in which the disc is used for activation only, and all the game content is then accessed online. Consequently, Microsoft is expected to put a greater focus on cloud gaming. Hardware-wise, Microsoft may unveil an updated version of its motion-sensing technology Kinect at tonight's event with a 1,920x1,080 sensor, which will come with the console. The console is expected to have an eight-core CPU from AMD. A Blu-ray drive also seems likely, as well as USB 3.0 connections and a 500GB hard drive. Although Microsoft is set to unveil its latest version of its Xbox console at an event in Redmond, Washington tonight, it may save some announcements for the E3 conference in Los Angeles, in June. Microsoft has already hinted that its IllumiRoom system, which can project images from your Xbox screen around your living room, will be unveiled at the conference . Microsoft's Smart Glass technology acts as a second screen for the Xbox 360. An updated version of the technology is expected to be announced at tonight's launch event . Microsoft officially bought video-calling software Skype in October 2011, and replaced its Windows Live Messenger with the software earlier this year. It's therefore expected that Skype will be heavily integrated into the new Xbox console, too. The new console is also said to have improved voice recognition, with more of a focus on 'natural interaction and context', according to reports on The Verge. The Verge add that users will be able to automatically resume video content where it left off, and the new Xbox will have speech-to-text functions. Microsoft Research Project released a video in January showcasing its IllumiRoom technology -  a system that projects images and lights from whatever game or film you're watching around your living room. It was described by Microsoft as: 'designed to push the boundary of living room immersive entertainment by blending our virtual and physical worlds with projected visualisations' and was dubbed a real-life 'holodeck', making reference to the Star Trek technology. Many Xbox users are hoping this technology will be announced at the Xbox event tonight, but it's more likely to be announced officially at this year's E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) conference in Los Angeles, in June. This suggests it won't be included with the new console, but may feature in updates or future models. Kinect sensor for Xbox 360. Microsoft is expected to launch the next-generation of this motion-sensing technology, including a new sensor, games, and improved performance at a launch event in Washington tonight. The sensor will be shipped with the new Xbox console, which is due to go on sale at the end of the year and is expected to be called Xbox 720 . Why would Microsoft want to prevent second-hand sales? Because it costs them money. Console manufacturers take a slice of the revenue of every game sold for use on their machine. But if gamers sell-on their games, or part exchange them, the developers and console manufacturers don't get anything from each subsequent sale. So is this rumour bad news for gamers? Not necessarily. Many will bemoan not being able to cash in old games. But if more people are buying games, the cost of games could come down. Most games normally sell for Â£40 when first released - though the second-hand market quickly drives the price down. But, possibly more importantly, it could see an end to various unpopular methods developers have employed to discourage trading in games. This has included selling part of the game as additional content (often referred to as DLC - Downloadable Content) to gamers who don't own first-hand copies. It has also seen many 'single-player' games have 'multi-player' elements added to them, so gamers can keep on playing the game against friends instead of trading it in. This has not always been popular, as many gamers feel the quality of the original game is watered down to 'crowbar in' features they don't want. Microsoft may also push its Smart Glass technology more with its new Xbox. The technology acts as a 'second screen' that lets you currently control your Xbox 360 console with your phone or tablet. Only a few games support the Smart Glass system at the moment but Microsoft may make it more widely used across its Surface tablets, as well as iOS and Android devices with the launch of the new Xbox console. Microsoft is expected to launch the console by the 'holiday season', around November or December. this year . The console is also expected to cost around $299 in the US, and Â£299 in the UK. Official release dates and prices should be announced at tonight's event. Last November Nintendo launched the Wii U, . the successor to the popular Wii system featuring an innovative . tablet-like controller. Nintendo said it sold just 3.45 million units by the end of March, well below expectations. Microsoft will likely take aim at Nintendo, as well as Sony, during tonight's unveiling at its headquarters in Redmond. Sony was first to showcase plans for its upcoming PlayStation 4 - but not the actual box - at an event in New York last February. The reaction to that console, which featured richer graphics and more social features, was mixed. A new trailer for the PlayStation 4 was released yesterday.

"By . Catherine Eade . PUBLISHED: . 19:00 EST, 11 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:05 EST, 12 December 2013 . Catherine Eade says though she is happy in her own company she misses having a man to talk to . Her question was direct and accusing, catching me unawares over the breakfast table. I tried — and failed — not to look guilty. ‘Mum, who was that man at the door last night?’ Trying to secretly ‘date’ under the watchful eye of an 11-year-old mourning her father’s departure from the family home was proving impossible. Caught in the twilight world of post-divorce heartache, I hoped for a new relationship at some point, but it didn’t feel right at that moment and it clearly wasn’t something my youngest daughter was comfortable with. Coming up with a not-terribly-convincing tale about a problem with the car, I wondered if I’d ever negotiate this no-man’s land between raw, painful separation and the world of dating. When my husband Mark moved out after our 16-year marriage broke down last year, I spent months in virtual lockdown, vowing never to go near a man again. He’d moved in with his girlfriend just weeks after we split, a situation that our three children — Jasmine, 15, Joe, 13, and 11-year-old Alex — weren’t exactly keen on. The last thing I wanted was to rock the boat further by introducing a new man into their lives. But I did miss having a partner. I just didn’t know if I’d ever be able to ease a man into this domestic tinderbox. Please, before the howls of ‘you don’t need a man to be happy’ begin, yes, I know that. I have a caring family and an amazing group of female friends. I am happy in my own company and have been happi(ish)ly single for a year, but I miss having a man to talk to. I love it when I get on as well with my friends’ partners as I do with my friends, and I have in the past had good male friends. But a few months after my husband left, I realised I had been almost solely in the company of women. Men friends seemed to have faded into the background since my split from Mark, possibly because they felt obliged to take his ‘side’. Catherine, 46, and her 'nearly' boyfriend Simon, 40, who have been supporting each other through the stresses of divorce . So when I met Simon, a 40-year-old IT consultant, at a music festival last summer, I thought I was ready to try again. There was an immediate mutual attraction, and after a couple of nights spent chatting until the small hours by the campfire outside my tent while my youngest, Alex, was asleep, we swapped phone numbers. Like me, Simon had also come out of a marriage and was involved in divorce proceedings, with money worries and childcare issues complicating everyday life. I discovered that he lived just around the corner from me in Brighton and we began spending time together, meeting up in the odd hours when I didn’t have my children and he didn’t have his seven-year-old son, Harry. Catherine and Simon accompany each other to 'plus one' invitations to occasions that no one likes to attend alone . Simon was a very pleasant distraction from what was turning into an ever-more acrimonious divorce, but after a few weeks of ‘dating’ it became clear that neither of us was ready to leap into a serious relationship. The huge emotional demands placed on people who are negotiating childcare arrangements with a difficult ex, and the wrangling over finances and property — not to mention disentanglement from such a key relationship — leaves little room for falling in love. However, the strong bond that Simon and I had forged meant I was loath to write off our brief relationship as just a summer fling, and Simon insisted that he wanted me in his life, too. ‘What is going on with us?’ I asked him one evening as we sat outside on his balcony with a glass of wine. Simon looked across at me and held my gaze. ‘When you really click with someone, it doesn’t have to mean sexually,’ he said. ‘I like you way too much to pursue something that might not last and would end in loss.’ So we agreed on a compromise: Simon is to be my ‘almost’ boyfriend. I’m his ‘not quite’ girlfriend. We are more than close friends, but not ready to make the leap into coupledom. We are a halfway house as we lick our wounds and learn to trust again. Simon will turn up at my house with a bottle of wine and a hug when I’ve had a bad day. He will fix a household problem if I can’t. We play badminton, go on long walks, organise Sunday roasts for family and friends and even find ourselves in B&Q on a weekend afternoon: all the things couples do, but without being a couple. And my children like Simon, as they know he is not my boyfriend (oh yes, the girls did ask) and so not a ‘replacement’ for their dad. In fact, Alex enjoys having someone other than me to help with her IT homework when I’m at a loss. Friends still can’t fathom it, though. ‘What’s the deal with Simon?’ one girlfriend asked me after we’d spent an entire weekend in and out of each other’s houses, eating together and taking the kids to the cinema. ‘We’re just friends,’ I said, laughing at the look of incredulity on her face. In truth, both Simon and I were enjoying having someone in our lives to fill the hole left by the exit of our respective life partners. Catherine says her and Simon are a halfway house as they 'lick their wounds and learn to trust again' following their respective separations . While neither of us was ready for a new partner yet, because our circumstances were so similar we regularly turned to each other for support and advice. One evening I was struggling to compose an email to Mark about childcare issues. Finding it hard to write something polite when I felt so sad and angry, I forwarded it to Simon for a second opinion. Soon after, I received a text from him which read: ‘Needs work. Come here to discuss?’ Five minutes later I was drinking tea in his kitchen, sharing information I wouldn’t dream of telling anyone else — certainly not a new boyfriend. Simon had added at the start of my first draft: ‘Hi Mark, I hope you had a nice weekend’ — something I’m afraid I would have had to type through gritted teeth. He also explained that, as a man, he would prefer to receive communications from an  ex-partner clearly stating what was being asked for, not littered with emotion or references to perceived failings. I had to admit that his version garnered a much more reasonable reply from Mark. In return, Simon showed me a couple of texts and emails from Emma, his ex, that he had found baffling and I — as a woman — was able to translate. Then, of course, there are those ‘plus one’ invitations to occasions that no one likes to attend alone. One weekend, the prospect of going to a friend’s wedding reception seemed too much,  and I asked Simon to be  my chaperone. ‘You don’t have to pretend to be my boyfriend, but it would be good if you could look adoringly at me every now and then,’ I joked. Simon’s company that night gave me the confidence to attend. And he certainly rose to the task, which made a huge difference to my mood. Two weeks later Simon asked me to accompany him in turn to a social event at his son’s school. We had a whale of a time. One of the saddest things about a break-up is the way that friends feel they have to ‘take sides’. This was another reason why our ‘almost’ relationship felt so important: I was devastated to have lost some friends I’d known for years. Simon had no ties to my past and was therefore all mine. He felt the same way, having also lost a group of friends who had dropped him in favour of his ex. I can’t deny that I find Simon attractive and he says I am one of the loveliest people he’s met. But while we have on more than one occasion said those three little words to each other, we don’t fancy each other physically. That’s not to say it didn’t enter my head a few times that we could be ‘a real couple’ — but not yet. We’re simply not ready. ‘Why do you like being with me?’ I asked Simon once. ‘I enjoy talking to someone who understands what I’m going through and is supportive, who can shed light on the whole break-up scenario,’ he said. ‘You bring out the best in me.’ It is a boost to my self-esteem to spend time with Simon, and he feels the same way about me. We have the best of all worlds: we don’t argue, the kids never find us kissing or cuddling and freak out, and there is no pressure about our ‘future’. Who knows, maybe we will end up together in 20 years’ time. But until then we’re perfectly happy being each other’s ‘nearly’.","Catherine's husband Mark moved out after the breakdown of their 16 year marriage .

"By . Rachel Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 08:44 EST, 20 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:12 EST, 21 May 2013 . A study has discovered that early humans began hurling stone-tipped spears and darts at large prey at least 90,000 years ago. There has been debate surrounding the precise date that early man began to use stone-tipped spears - with some experts suggesting their use as far back as 500,000 years ago -  but until now, evidence to prove theories had been lacking. The throwing of spears was an important development because by throwing instead of . thrusting, humans could hunt buffalo and other game from a . safer distance, and with less risk of mauling. By using a calibrated cross-bow, archaeologists replicated the indentations made in animal bone by stone-tipped spears. They discovered that the same indentations were found in bones at least 90,000 years old . Archaeologist Corey O'Driscoll, of South . East Archaeology in Canberra, Australia, shaped flint reproductions of spear and . arrow points from the Middle Stone Age in Africa and attached them to . wooden shafts, according to a report in Science Now. Together with a group of University of Queensland students, O'Driscoll ran . 15 experiments, throwing replica spears with . bows or a calibrated crossbow at lamb and cow carcasses. After boiling . the carcasses or burying them for rapid defleshing by microbes and . insects, he found 758 wounds on the bones, which he examined . microscopically, and compared to 201 cut marks in an experimentally . created reference collection of butchered animal bones. The results showed 'quite a difference between the . butchering marks and projectile impact marks,'  and revealed six types of distinctive projectile impact wounds, from drag . marks to fracture marks and punctures. Using the new technique, archaeologists discovered that the marks made . by projectile  or thrown spears (left) were quite different from marks . made by spears used to simple stab or cut into the bone (right) O'Driscoll also noted that most . projectile impact marks were located on vertebrae or rib bones and that . 17 per cent of the marks overall - and 50 per cent of the punctures - held . microscopic fragments of stone from the flint points, due to the . high speed of impact. By contrast, none of the butchering marks . contained such stone fragments, another key distinction. These findings prompted O'Driscoll and . the University of Queensland's Jessica Thompson to take a new look at . three bone specimens from large unidentified mammals - a rib and two . vertebrae - from Pinnacle Point Cave in South Africa. Using . O'Driscoll's diagnostic criteria, the pair identified projectile impact . marks on all three bones. Experts have debated the precise date at which early man started to use stone-tipped spears for many years, but until now evidence to back up the various theories were lacking . Two dated to between 91,000 and 98,000 years . ago and the third dated even earlier, between 153,000 and 174,000 years ago - making them the oldest direct evidence of the use of projectile . weapons. Archaeologist Tiina Manne at the . University of Queensland also finds the identification of projectile . impact marksâ€”at least on the two later bonesâ€”highly persuasive: 'This . strongly suggests that projectile technology at Pinnacle Point was in . use by at least 90 to 95,000 years ago,' she says. But she's less . convinced by the evidence on the oldest bone, noting that only a 'single . grain' of stone from the projectile point was embedded in the bone. O'Driscoll's thesis will be . published by the Australian Archaeological Association in June.","Experts have argued over the date at which early man first used stone-tipped spears, but there was very little evidence to back up various theories .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 17:48 EST, 13 December 2013 . A 21-year-old man is heading to death row for his part in the grisly slaying of a Florida teenager that shocked the nation in 2011. During a 10-minute hearing Friday, Circuit Judge David Eddy sentenced Michael Shane Bargo to death, making him the youngest of Florida's 404 death row inmates. He was the last of five defendants to be sentenced in the April 2011 murder of Seath Jackson, 15, near Ocala. Justice served: Michael Bargo, 21, was sentenced to death today for his part in the slaying of teenager Seath Jackson in April 2011 . Stone-faced: Bargo stared blankly at the judge as he read his sentence, only blinking a few times . Emotional day: Family and friends of Michael Bargo wept in the audience after learning of his fate . Too little, too late: Bargo's father, described during the trial as an abusive alcoholic, called out to him, saying 'I love you, son,' before he was led away . The other defendants — Amber Wright, . 17; Kyle Hooper, 19; Charlie Kay Ely, 21; and Justin Soto, 22 — were all . sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors . say Jackson was lured to the home by his ex-girlfriend, Amber Wright, . where he was beaten, shot and tortured before his body was burned in a . backyard fire pit. Dubious honor: At age 21, Bargo is the youngest of Florida's 404 death row inmates . The . teen's remains were then placed into three paint buckets and dumped into . a limerock pit. Testimony showed bad blood existed between Jackson and . Bargo, who started dating Wright after her split from the 15-year-old. Bargo was believed to be the triggerman and mastermind behind the plot to kill Jackson. On the stand, however, Bargo fingered Hooper as the gunman. 'I . reference my experience to note this is the most cold, calculated . premeditated case of murder I have ever seen,' Judge Eddy said in court . Friday, the Ocala Star-Banner reported. In a recent jailhouse interview with the Star-Banner, Bargo said, ‘I'm not crazy, I'm not a psycho, I'm not a bad person.’ During the trial, Hooper described how Bargo ordered him to place Jackson in the bathtub alive so he would know who killed him. Bargo . told jurors during his trial in August that he wasn't at the home when . Jackson was killed and was only an accessory after the fact. The jury . recommended the death sentence by a 10-2 vote. During . the penalty phase of the trial the defense presented evidence of a . messy separation between his parents that left Bargo angry and bitter. They also suggested that Bargo suffers from seizures in his brain where he becomes unable to control his emotions. Convicted killer: Michael Bargo, pictured in August, was convicted in . less than three hours for his part in the 2011 murder of Seath Jackson. A jury late yesterday decided he deserved the death sentence . The . state countered with an expert that disagrees with some of the . defense's assessment. They said Bargo was in control of his emotions the . night Jackson was killed. During . his sentencing, the 21-year-old sat at the defense table staring . blankly at the judge. Upon learning his fate, Bargo merely blinked, but . showed no emotion. Jackson's family wasn't in the courtroom Friday. Bargo's relatives sobbed in the courtroom upon learning the sentence. His father, Michael Bargo Sr., called out ‘I love you son,’ before he was taken away. The average death row inmate remains incarcerated in a cell measuring 6 by 9 feet for 13 years before execution. His defense attorney argued that Bargo didn't act alone and he was clearly mentally ill. But prosecutors convinced the majority of the 12-person jury at Marion County Court that Bargo was the mastermind of a cold, calculated and premeditated murder and deserved the death sentence. His mother, Tracey O'Brien, 38, tearfully testified before the verdict in August that her son had grown up with an alcoholic father with an explosive temper. His . lawyers attempted to avoid the death penalty by arguing that Bargo, Jr . suffered abuse at the hands of his mother and was traumatized by his . parents' divorce. Disturbing: Seath Tyler Jackson was brutally murdered and his body burned in a pit. His remains were then shovelled into paint cans and thrown in a dumpster . Callous crime: Michael Bargo (left), and Charlie Ely (right) were both convicted for Seath Jackson's murder . Associates: Justin Soto (left) was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, while James Young Havens III, was eventually found not to have been involved in the crime . Ex-girlfriend: Amber Wright (left) and her step-brother Kyle Hooper (right) were both sentenced to life in prison without parole . The devastated mother was summoned to the Florida court from her home in Michigan to testify at her son's sentencing hearing. O'Brien . reportedly did not testify at her son's murder trial because, according . to testimony from Bargo, Sr, her son didn't want her there. She . told the court that the hearing was the first time she'd seen her son . in four years and detailed her unhappy marriage with Bargo, Sr, who she . described as an abusive alcoholic who regularly lashed out in anger. 'He would throw . dinner if it wasn't warm, or I said something wrong or we got into an . argument, he would start throwing things,' she said. Six people were arrested in . connection to the brutal murder of Seath Jackson and four have already been . convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Jackson was lured to a home in April 2011 by his ex-girlfriend Amber Wright under the pretense of rekindling their relationship. Once Jackson arrived at the house, her new boyfriend Bargo, along with Wright, Justin Soto, Charlie K Ely and Kyle Hooper beat him, shot him multiple times, tied . him up, broke his knees and burned his body alive, disposing of his remains in paint cans . which they threw into a quarry. Relieved: The parents of Seath Jackson, Sonia (center) and Scott Jackson were pleased when their son's killer was found guilty of his murder last week .

Hundreds of autism sufferers are being recruited by a German software designer to train as high tech IT experts. SAP said it wants to recruit up to 500 sufferers because 'they think differently from others'.  An autistic person is more likely to be of average or above-average intelligence and possess 'certain skills' that the company wants to tap into. The firm employs more than 65,000 people globally. By 2020 the aim is for one percent of these to be autistic, it announced from its headquarters in south-western Germany. Dustin Hoffman in Rainman, a film that first brought autism into the public eye . Recruitment begins this year in . Germany, America and Canada, assisted by Danish specialists with . experience in hiring autistic people for large firms. Indeed there is a higher than normal proportion of autistic people working in the information technology industry. Autism as a condition was first . brought home to millions by Dustin Hoffmann in the movie Rain Man in . which he played the autistic brother of Tom Cruise's character. Sufferers . display different symptoms. Some people have no language, intellectual . difficulties and are not able engage with others. Other people may have very good or even advanced language skills but find social behavioural norms hard to grasp. The German firm wants more one per cent of its 65,000-strong workforce to be autistic by 2020 . Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex. Parents . usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. They usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first . develop more normally and then regress. Early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help autistic children . gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is . no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who . recovered. Autism and Asperger syndrome are both part of a range of related developmental disorders known as autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). ASD can cause a wide range of symptoms including difficulties with social interaction, impaired language and communication skills as well as unusual or repetitive patterns of thought and physical behaviour. Some people with autism are low-functioning meaning that they find it difficult to speak, interact and in some cases are only able to process minimal amounts of information. However, at the other end of the spectrum is a very high-functioning sufferer, who can in many cases outperform people with no underlying condition. Studies have shown that these autistic people possess an enhanced ability to process information and remember data. This may explain why there is a higher than normal proportion of autistic people working in the information technology industry. A University College London study carried out last year gave 16 adults with autism and 16 adults without autism a task designed to assess their 'perceptual load capacity'. Both groups were successful at the task in the easier initial stages, but the adults with autism significantly outperformed those without autism as the task became more difficult. This, the scientists said, proved that the brains of autistic people are able to process greater amounts of information. Previous studies have also linked the . trademarks of genius - breathtaking achievement, attention to detail and . obsession with a particular subject - to autism.","By 2020, SAP wants one per cent of its 65,000-strong workforce to have the condition ."

An aircraft fleet owned by Google's founders and former CEO received improper discounts on jet fuel that saved the three billionaires up to $5.3 million dating back to depths of the Great Recession in 2009, according to a government report released yesterday. The findings by NASA's inspector general surfaced during a review of a government airfield lease for seven planes and two helicopters controlled by Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and the Internet search company's former CEO, Eric Schmidt. The aircraft are managed through a company called H211 set up by the three men through the tremendous wealth that they have accumulated as Google Inc.'s stock price has soared from $85 in 2004 to nearly $1,100. Billionaire business men: Google's former CEO Eric Schmidt (left) is worth about $8 billion and Google founder Sergey Brin (right) is worth about $25 billion . Page, who is Google's current CEO, and Brin, who heads the company's special projects division, are each worth about $25 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Schmidt, who became executive chairman after stepping down as CEO in 2011, is worth about $8 billion. H211 has been paying $1.4 million annually since 2007 to lease hangar space from NASA at Moffett Federal Airfield, a former U.S. Navy base 4 miles from Google's Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. NASA's inspector general concluded that the rent for the hangar space represented a fair rate, but the inspector general's report flagged the bargain that Google's jet-setting executives got on the fuel for their flights around the world. The H211 aircraft saved somewhere from $3.3 million to $5.3 million beginning in 2009 by buying fuel through an arm of the U.S. Department of Defense at below-market prices that allowed them to avoid state and local taxes, according to the report. Google founder Larry Page is worth about $25 billion . The discounts didn't result in any losses for NASA or the Department of Defense, the report said, but probably deprived the state of California and local government agencies of tax revenue. Other fuel suppliers probably missed out on an opportunity to make money had H211 not worked out the special arrangement with the government. The inspector general recommended that NASA and H211 discuss possible ways to address a situation that 'engendered a sense of unfairness and a perception of favoritism.' H211 spokesman Ken Ambrose said the company was reviewing the audit's findings. The report said the improper fuel discounts stopped in September after questions were raised about the bargain prices. The discounts given to H211 stemmed from a 'misunderstanding' about the relationship between NASA and the aircraft used by the Google executives, according to the inspector general. As part of its lease, H211 agreed that its planes would carry instruments to collect climate data for NASA at no cost to the space agency. The planes doing work for NASA qualified for the discounts, the report said. But the jet fuel was also sold to the H211 planes even when the Google executives were using the aircraft for recreation and other business with no benefit to NASA. A snapshot of flight activity taken between August 2012 and July of this year found nearly three-fourths of the H211 excursions of out Moffett Field had no connection to NASA. Of the 229 total flights during that time, 59 involved a NASA science mission and most of them were handled by an Alpha Jet that the Google executives obtained to fulfill their obligations to the space agency. H211 also owns or leases six Boeing or Gulfstream planes. Racking up the air miles: Google owns several aircraft, including this Gulfstream V private jet . Since the NASA lease began, H211 has flown more than 200 science flights for the space agency. The inspector general calculated that NASA would have had to pay $668,000 if it had been billed for the H211 flights taken from September 2010 through July of this year. Despite that benefit, a consumer group frequently critical of Google blasted the airfield lease as a 'sweetheart deal' for some of the world's richest people at time when millions of other people are struggling to make ends meet in a still-fragile economy. 'We think it's pretty outrageous,' said John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog. 'Basically, it's just another example of preferential treatment for the Google guys.' H211's lease at Moffett Airfield Field expires in July. The Google executives are working with a private contractor to build another space for their planes at the Mineta San Jose International Airport located about 10 miles from Moffett.

With an array of bright coloured lights reflecting against the frosty waters of the lake and creating magical silhouettes of the trees against the dark night sky, Syon Park in Middlesex looks more akin to something out of a fairytale than a stately home on the outskirts of London. The second home of the Duke of Northumberland and his family has been lit up in a rainbow of festive colours to get you in the mood for Christmas a month early. The Park's Enchanted Woodland attraction launched for the eighth year running this weekend. Colourful: The gardens of Syon Park in Brentford, Middlesex, have been transformed into an enchanted woodland for the eighth year in a row . Bright lights: Visitors take a stroll through a light show in the Great Conservatory at the London home of the Duke of Northumberland . Enchanted: The attraction allows visitors to walk a trail around the house's eighteenth century lake and inside the Great Conservatory . Gardens have existed on the site for around 600 years - but they have rarely looked as beautiful as when they are lit up at the start of each winter for the annual event. Visitors can stroll the grounds after dark and take in a spellbinding mile-long trail that takes in the estate's eighteenth century lake, part of its vast 200 acre grounds and the Great Conservatory of the grand house. Syon Park is known for its impressive gardens, which now have more than 400 species of tree, including rare and unusual specimen. It has often been a pioneer of horticultural trends, once home to the UK's earliest botanical collection and home of the first garden centre. Winter wonderland: Colourful lights brighten up the already serene scene around the lake at Syon Park . Beautiful: A line of trees along the trail are lit up purple.

Stunning: The different shapes of the various types of trees are lit up and provide the perfect contrast with the backdrop of the night sky . An abbey was first built on the site now occupied by Syon House in 1431. Its vast and impressive gardens were designed by Lancelot 'Capability' Brown in the eighteenth century at the request of the 1st Duke of Northumberland Hugh Percy. The Great Conservatory, which houses part of the trail, was designed by Charles Fowler in 1828 and finally completed in 1830. It was the first of its kind to be built from metal and glass. In 1547, King Henry VIII's coffin was brought to Syon on its way to Windsor for burial. It allegedly burst open during the night and in the morning dogs were found licking up the remains.

Ms Farnes said: 'The writer Eddie Braben, the third man behind the success of Morecambe and Wise, died this morning at the age of 82 after a short illness. 'It was Billy Cotton Jnr at the BBC who recognised the brilliance of Eddie's writing was the ideal marriage that would guarantee the success of Morecambe and Wise. 'He is survived by his loving wife Dee, three children and six grandchildren.' Ms Farnes added: 'Eddie was a very humble man, a very quiet man and a very private man. He had a lot of integrity, which is in short supply in this business. 'I have to say - and he would have disagreed with this - that writing came easy to him, even on bad days, when he was writing Christmas shows for Eric and Ernie and he was under great pressure. Eddie Braben wrote his autobiography about his life's work entitled The Book What I Wrote which was published in 2004 . 'He was a writer. And as Eric Sykes used . to say, when you're a writer, you're a writer 24 hours of the day. That . applies to Eddie very much. He was a great observationist.' Sir Bruce Forsyth, who worked with Braben on Play Your Cards Right, paid tribute to the 'fantastic writer' He said: 'This is sad news, it really is. He was a fantastic writer. What he did for Eric (Morecambe) and Ernie (Wise) was incredible. He was the third man of the comedy. 'I wish I could have been doing the kind of shows he had written. His jokes and style of writing will be sorely missed in the business.' The Strictly Come Dancing host added that he was surprised to hear of the comedian's death, because he had recently seen him and he had 'looked fine'. Braben, who was born in Liverpool on Halloween 1930, first discovered his passion for comedy listening to the radio shows of Arthur Askey as a child. After school he followed his parents into market trading, manning a fruit and veg stall, but continued to writes jokes on the back of the brown paper bags he used to package his goods. Braben then began sending jokes to comedians performing in Liverpool and sold his first piece to Charlie Chester for 2 shilling 6 pence. But his first major success came when he teamed up with Ken Dobb and continued to help write his material for 12 years. The fellow Liverpudlian today paid tribute to his former colleague. Mr Dodd said: 'He was a brilliant comic scriptwriter and a brilliant man. He made me laugh a great deal. He was a wonderful writer.' The pair worked on one-liners for Dodd's quick-fire stand-up routines in the 1960s and 70s. He added: 'He had a very good, down to earth approach to humour, and he was never satirical or vulgar. He was full of fun. He loved to laugh. 'He achieved so many wonderful things, and did so many great shows.'

Eddie Braben was behind many of jokes and witty scripts that made More and Wise, pictured, so popular . Dodd's style was good training for Braben because his relentless delivery averaged around seven jokes a minute. But . his ultimate success came when the BBC lured Morecambe and Wise from .

But when the comedy duo were lured back to ITV in 1978, Braben remained under contract with the BBC, and didn't team up with Morecambe and Wise again until the 1980s.

The Ministry of Defence is squandering billions of pounds on kit and supplies it does not need while trying to save money by getting rid of troops. Military chiefs are wasting ‘unacceptable’ sums of taxpayers’ cash by buying and hoarding excess equipment, according to a scathing report today. MPs on the Commons’ Public Accounts Committee found at least £6.6billion of stock was either unused or over-ordered. Tax money: The MoD has wasted £6.6bn on equipment it does not need - including spare parts for the Nimrod MR2 last them 54 years, a plane which was scrapped in 2009 . The top civil servant at the MoD, permanent secretary Jon Thompson, admitted there were ‘problems’ in managing the inventory of kit and equipment. He said the cash-strapped department was spending £1.1billion on a computer system to tackle ‘weaknesses’ in stock control. The cross-party committee’s report will be a blow to morale as the fighting capability of the Army, Royal Navy and RAF continues to be reduced. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is axing 29,000 personnel and scrapping warships, fighter jets and armoured vehicles in an attempt to balance the books. The report by MPs came as the Royal United Services Institute think-tank warned that the MoD faces having to find another £17billion of cuts over  the next decade. The MoD has 710million items in its stores – everything from nuclear submarines and missiles to uniforms, medical supplies and ration packs. The inventory is worth £40.3billion. Staff cuts: Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is cutting 29,000 personnel and scrapping warships, fighter jets and armoured vehicles to save . The report said that the department had identified a £3.4billion stockpile of supplies that it wanted to get rid of, possibly by selling them on the MoD’s disposals website – a military version of eBay. Six propellers, total value £1.1million, for the remaining Type 42 destroyers. Only one  is still in service. A ten-year supply of fire-resistant overalls even though fewer than 200 a year are issued. Enough spare parts for the Nimrod MR2 maritime patrol aircraft to last 54 years. The spy plane was scrapped in 2009. Twenty-five air conditioning units valued at £135,000 have  not been used since at least March 2007. Twelve of them are unfit for use. MPs on the committee said they were ‘disappointed’ that problems still existed with MoD stock control despite being highlighted as long  ago as 1991. The committee said of the MoD: ‘The department has failed to provide effective incentives or accountability for those responsible for ordering, retaining and disposing of inventory.’ Tory Richard Bacon, committee vice-chairman, said: ‘It is unacceptable that the MoD is wasting significant amounts of public money buying equipment and supplies that it doesn’t need. 'It is particularly galling at a time when funding is tight. ‘With stock returning from Afghanistan and soon from Germany, the problem is likely to get worse.’ Bernard Gray, the MoD head of procurement, told the committee: ‘There is nothing more annoying than throwing something away and then finding, five minutes later, that it would cost you a fortune to replace it.’ Defence equipment minister Philip Dunne said: ‘I am determined  to reverse decades of lax inventory management.’","Military chiefs waste 6.6bn of taxpayers' money on unnecessary stock .

Prince Charles has accused middle-class consumers of fuelling the sickening global trade in illegal animal products that is putting dozens of species at risk of extinction. In an impassioned speech, the heir to the throne warned that an increased slaughter of animals such as elephants, rhinos and tigers to make exotic products that reflect people’s ‘economic prosperity’ is decimating the world’s wildlife. He was backed by his son, Prince William, who said: ‘I think the consumer deserves to know that the illegal animal parts’ fashionable and luxurious image is at odds with the barbarity of how these animals parts are obtained.’ See video of the speeches below . Cruel: Chiru antelope are killed to make the expensive woven shawls . Speaking at an Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference, Prince Charles . accused middle-class consumers of fuelling the sickening global trade in . illegal animal products that is putting dozens of species at risk of . extinction . Charles and Prince William are shown items made from endangered animals which had been confiscated by customs officers . In an impassioned speech, the heir to the throne warned that an increased slaughter of animals such as elephants, rhinos and tigers to make exotic products that reflect people's 'economic prosperity' is decimating the world's wildlife . The pair were speaking at an Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference co-hosted by Charles and government ministers at St James’s Palace, which has attracted delegates from around the world. Wildlife authorities have warned that despite the success of protection initiatives in the early 1990s, there has been a 3,000 per cent increase in rhino poaching alone in the last few years due to increased demand, particularly in the Far East where it is prized as an aphrodisiac. With price of horn reaching more than £40,000 a kilo, it is more valuable than most drugs. Worryingly, much of the proceeds are now going to fund organised crime, terrorist groups and rebel militias. Some rhino horn, along with elephant ivory jewellery, trinkets, and carvings, stuffed exotic animals and even items such as tortoise jelly and bear bile - extracted using tubes inserted into the animals’ stomachs - is now being regularly impounded by Border Force officials in the UK. The royals greet a customs officer and her search dog during the conference at Clarence House in central London. Charles said many animals are being pushed towards extinction 'at an alarming and unprecedented rate' There has also been a spike in demand in this country for £4,000-a-time Shahtoosh, a woollen shawl so fine it can pass through the centre of a wedding ring, which is woven using the hair of rare Tibetan antelope. This has led to a dramatic increase in the hunting of the endangered species, which has seen their numbers plummet from one million to just 75,000 in the wild today. Charles, who is President of the World Wildlife Fund-UK, was flanked by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson at the conference, and appealed for nations to redouble their efforts in wiping out the illegal wildlife trade. He revealed that it was the fourth biggest transnational crime - just behind trafficking in weapons, drugs and people - with a value of £11 billion and insisted that stamping out the illegal wildlife trade ‘needs to be placed very near the top of the global agenda’. ‘Organised crime has become heavily involved in the illegal wildlife trade because, quite obviously, there is a lot of money to be made, and the risk of being caught is relatively low,’ the royal said. ‘Skyrocketing demand - primarily, but not exclusively, from Asia - for ivory, rhino horn and tiger parts, as well as other products, is fuelling this astonishing explosion in poaching. William and his father were shown bottles of 'snake whiskey', dried seahorses, ornaments made from ivory that had been covered in boot polish to disguise them and elephant hide books . ‘The bulk of the intended use is no longer for products that can be classified as traditional medicines. Instead, members of the world’s growing middle class are seeking exotic products that reflect their economic prosperity and status.’ He explained that ‘organised bands of criminals’ are stealing and slaughtering elephants, rhinoceros and tigers, as well as other species ‘in a way that has never been seen before’ using ‘weapons of war’ such as assault rifles, night vision equipment and helicopters. As a result, many animals, he warned, are being pushed towards extinction ‘at an alarming and unprecedented rate’. There has been a spike in demand in this country for £4,000-a-time Shahtoosh, a woollen shawl woven using the hair of rare Tibetan antelope (above). This has led to a dramatic increase in the hunting of the endangered species, which has seen numbers plummet from one million to just 75,000 . He added: ‘It is surely unthinkable . that these creatures, which have roamed the planet for thousands, if not . millions, of years, could disappear completely within a decade, or even . less. ‘As a father and a soon-to-be grandfather, I find it inconceivable that our children and grandchildren live in a world bereft of these animals. ‘Humanity is less than humanity without the rest of creation. Their destruction will diminish us all.’ Prince William, who is president of conservation charity Tusk Trust, added: ‘I sincerely hope that my generation is not the first on this planet to consider elephants, rhinos or tigers as historical creatures - in the same category as the dodo.’ Afterwards the royal pair examined some of the Border Force’s most recent grisly seizures from this country, including a stuffed baby tiger, barely a few weeks old. William momentarily closed his eyes in disgust and said: ‘Unbelievable. It’s so small, such a waste.’ He and his father were also shown bottles of ‘snake whiskey’, dried seahorses, ornaments made from ivory that had been covered in boot polish to disguise them and elephant hide books. He was also told how in February this year, officers from the Border Forces CITIES team at Heathrow Airport intercepted a yellow Rolls-Royce Phantom whose interior had been furnished almost entirely with alligator skin. Charlie Mayhew, the Chief Executive of Tusk Trust who accompanied the prince, also urged British holidaymakers to use extreme caution when buying holiday trinkets abroad this summer that they had not been sourced from illegally slaughtered animals. ‘Although the vast majority of demand for these items stems from Asia, the issue is one we are not immune from in the UK,’ he said.","Royal warned slaughter for middle-class products is decimating wildlife .

Scientists at King’s College London have discovered vitamin D has the potential to significantly cut the symptoms of sufferers. They say it may one day be prescribed as a treatment alongside conventional steroids, but reducing the need for medication. Discovery: Vitamin D helps reduce the symptoms of asthma and could be used with steroids in future . A new study found the ‘sunshine’ vitamin resulted in lower levels of a natural chemical in the body that aggravates symptoms in asthma patients and cuts the effectiveness of steroids. More than five million Britons suffer asthma, including 1.4 million children, and the disease causes 1,400 deaths each year. Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways, causing them to constrict and resulting in attacks of breathlessness and wheezing which can be fatal. Severe asthma is currently treated with steroid tablets which can have harmful side effects. Many sufferers have a steroid resistant variation of the condition making it even more difficult to treat and putting them at greater risk of hospitalisation from severe, even life-threatening, asthma attacks. In a study funded by Asthma UK . charity, a team of scientists at King’s identified a mechanism through . which Vitamin D can reduce asthma symptoms, providing a potential target . for future treatments. IL -17A is a natural chemical which . helps to defend the body against infection, but is known to exacerbate . asthma and reduce responsiveness to steroids when produced in larger . amounts. Experiments: Scientists at King's College London conducted the study into how the vitamin could be used . The team examined the production of IL-17A and levels of the chemical in cells from 18 steroid resistant asthma patients and 10 patients who responded to steroids, as well as a control group of 10 healthy people. Results showed that patients with asthma had much higher levels of IL-17A than those without asthma and patients with steroid resistant asthma expressed the highest levels of IL-17A. Further tests showed that while steroids were unable to lower the production of IL-17A in cells from patients with asthma, vitamin D significantly cut the production of IL-17A in cells from all patients studied. The results demonstrate that vitamin D could potentially provide an effective add-on treatment for all asthma sufferers, reducing the amount of steroid-based medicines prescribed. There is growing evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be responsible for triggering a range of diseases, including several cancers. The body makes most of its vitamin D from sunlight, although oily fish is a good dietary source. Professor Catherine Hawrylowicz from the Medical Research Council & Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma at King’s, who led the study, said the findings were ‘very exciting’. Light: The 'sunshine vitamin' could reduce the amount of steroids an asthma sufferer has to take . She said ‘They show that Vitamin D could one day be used not only to treat people with steroid resistant asthma but also to reduce the doses of steroids in other asthma patients, reducing the risk of harmful side effects. ‘The results are so positive that we are testing this in a clinical trial in steroid resistant asthma patients to further research the possibilities of vitamin D as a potential treatment.’ The study is published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Malayka Rahman, Research Analysis and Communications Officer at Asthma UK, said: ‘For the majority of people with asthma, current available medicines are an effective way of managing the condition but we know that they don’t work for everyone,  which is why research into new treatments is vital. ‘We also know that many people with asthma have concerns about the side effects of their medicines so if vitamin D is shown to reduce the amount of medicines required, this would have an enormous impact on people’s quality of life. We look forward to the results of the clinical trial.’ Ginger: Study shows that human airways become more relaxed when exposed to the root . Ginger could provide a new route for helping asthma patients, say US researchers. They found tissue samples taken from human airways became more relaxed when exposed to purified components of the spicy root also may have properties that help asthma patients breathe more easily. The ginger extracts enhanced the effect of medication known as beta-agonists which are commonly prescribed to people with asthma. Researcher Elizabeth Townsend, of Columbia University Department of Anesthesiology, said ‘In our study, we demonstrated that purified components of ginger can work synergistically with beta-agonists to relax airway smooth muscle . ‘These compounds may provide additional relief of asthma symptoms when used in combination.’ The results of the study will be presented at the American Thoracic Society 2013 International Conference in Philadelphia.","Vitamin D has the potential to significantly cut the symptoms of sufferers.

Three Royal Marines will stand trial next week for the alleged murder of a Taliban prisoner held in their custody in Afghanistan. The Commandos, who for security reasons can only be identified as Marines A, B and C, are accused of the suspected execution of a wounded enemy combatant at a British base. The case, which is the first time British troops have been charged with murder in the 12-year conflict, is considered so sensitive that Prime Minister David Cameron has been briefed on its progress by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. The incident first emerged after civilian police officers found footage on a Marine's laptop while investigating entirely unrelated crime. The video appeared to show Commandos standing over a captive and discussing his fate - the Afghan had apparently  suffered injury during a shootout with UK forces. Royal Marines will stand trial next week for the alleged murder of a Taliban prisoner (British military vehicles pictured in Afghanistan) Civilian police officers informed the Royal Military Police (RMP) of their concerns and a major investigation  was launched. The RMP then cross-referenced the video evidence with reports of enemy engagements at that location on or about September 15, 2011. A year later seven Royal Marines were arrested and five were charged under military law with the 'murder of an unknown captured person'. The Service Prosecuting Authority later dropped the murder charges against two Marines. The court martial at Bulford, Wiltshire, is scheduled to start on Wednesday with the evidence expected to be heard until November 15. More than 63,000 people have joined a Facebook group set up to support the Royal Marines linked to the incident. Fears remain that the case will be exploited for propaganda purposes by UK-based terrorists.

David Cameron held talks with the billionaire head of Google yesterday but failed to tackle him over allegations the giant corporation has dodged hundreds of millions of pounds in tax. Eric Schmidt attended the meeting in Downing Street as a member of the Prime Minister’s elite Business Advisory Group. But the Google boss, who has an estimated fortune of £5.5billion, left by a back entrance, apparently in a vain attempt to avoid photographers. In and out: Google boss Eric Schmidt arrived for a top level meeting with David Cameron through the front door of Number 10, but later left via the back entrance . All smiles: Mr Schmidt (centre) seemed relaxed as he stepped from his car after being driven into Downing Street . Mr Cameron had given a presentation . on his plans to use next month’s G8 Summit in Northern Ireland to agree a . global crackdown on tax havens and corporate tax avoidance. But sources confirmed that he did not . confront Mr Schmidt directly over reports that Google paid only . £10million in corporation tax in the UK between 2006 and 2011, despite . revenues of £11.9billion. Senior Liberal Democrat peer Lord . Oakeshott said last night that it was extraordinary that the Prime . Minister had failed to tackle Mr Schmidt over Google’s alleged tax . avoidance, and called for him to be sacked from his advisory role. ‘How can David Cameron possibly not . see how outrageous it is to keep Mr Schmidt on his business advisory . group when Google is making a mint and paying pennies in tax in . Britain?’ he said. Last week Google vice president Matt . Brittin was questioned by MPs over the firm’s policy of processing UK . deals through the Republic of Ireland, where corporation tax is lower. Silence: Mr Cameron briefed his Business Advisory Group on his clampdown on tax avoidance but did not challenged Mr Schmidt over revelations about Google's low corporation tax bill . Margaret Hodge, chairman of the . public accounts committee, accused the company of ‘devious’ behaviour. At the weekend, a whistleblower claimed Google had used an ‘immoral’ tax . avoidance scheme to avoid hundreds of millions of pounds in tax. ‘Every time they switch on to Google . ... it reminds them of your rather devious, if I may say so, calculated . and in my view unethical behaviour in deliberately manipulating the . reality of your business to avoid paying your fair share of tax to the . common good? How do you think ordinary people feel?’ Referring . to the ‘Don’t be evil’ slogan, Mrs Hodge added: ‘I think you do do . evil. That is, you use smoke and mirrors to avoid paying tax.’ Former Google executive Barney Jones . said he was willing to hand more than 100,000 emails detailing a . ‘concocted scheme’ to avoid tax to HM Revenue and Customs. Google said Mr Schmidt had attended . yesterday’s meeting in a ‘personal capacity’, adding: ‘Google pays the . corporate tax due on its UK activities and complies fully with UK law’. A source said Mr Schmidt had . indicated agreement with the Prime Minister’s strategy of trying to . hammer out a deal to set international rules on tax that would make . large-scale avoidance much harder. Yesterday’s meeting came hours after . CBI president Sir Roger Carr warned Mr Cameron to stop ‘moralising’ to . business about tax. He accused politicians of using the tax affairs of . well-known corporations such as Google, Starbucks and Amazon as a . ‘political football’. Sir Roger, who later attended the . meeting of the Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Group, said tax . avoidance ‘cannot be about morality - there are no absolutes’. Meanwhile, Mr Cameron has written to . the leaders of offshore tax havens stressing the need to get their . houses in order as he pushes for international action to tackle . avoidance schemes. Business Secretary Vince Cable backed 'public outrage' at multi-national firms like Google and Amazon who use legal but 'unethical' means to avoid paying tax. However, the Prime Minister’s officials spokesman said he would not comment on companies or individuals, despite once branding the comedian Jimmy Carr’s tax avoidance as 'morally wrong'. Google vice president Matt Brittin floundered during the grilling by MPs, admitting that committee chairman Margaret Hodge knew more about his firm than he did . Ahead of the meeting Downing Street made clear Mr Cameron would not raise Google's tax affairs. ‘The Prime Minister will be taking the group through his G8 agenda. Tax and tax transparency are at the heart of that,’ the spokesman said. Asked whether the PM will specifically raise the concerns about Google's tax arrangements, the spokesman said: ‘We don't talk about individuals' or individual companies' tax affairs. ‘What the Prime Minister will be doing at that meeting today is explaining the tax transparency part of the G8 agenda which he has been discussing with other G8 leaders and will discuss again at the European Council this week. ‘He certainly is going to raise tax and reform of global tax rules including the ones under which multi-nationals operate. He is going to raise that with the entire Business Advisory Group. ‘When it comes to companies, companies should pay their tax.’ Mr Cameron will set out in detail the work which the UK has been doing in partnership with Germany, France, Spain and Italy on automatic exchanges of tax information. While refusing to challenge Google, the PM has written to the leaders of Britain's offshore tax havens stressing the need to ‘get our own houses in order’. Last year Google paid only £7.3million in corporation tax on more than £3billion in UK sales . In a message to 10 crown dependencies and British overseas territories Mr Cameron said he backed their right to be low tax jurisdictions but insisted that rules needed to be set and enforced fairly. He said he wanted the G8 to ‘knock down the walls of company secrecy’ to reveal who really owns and controls firms. The Prime Minister's letter calling for more transparency about tax information and the ownership of companies was sent to leaders in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Anguilla, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos Islands Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Mr Cameron wrote: ‘As you know, I have made fighting the scourge of tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance a priority for the G8 Summit which the UK is hosting next month. ‘With one month to go, this is the critical moment to get our own houses in order. I am looking to all the overseas territories and crown dependencies to continue to work in partnership with the UK in taking the lead on two critical issues: tax information exchange and beneficial ownership.’ He told the leaders: ‘I respect your right to be lower tax jurisdictions. I believe passionately in lower taxes as a vital driver of growth and prosperity for all. ‘But lower taxes are only sustainable if what is owed is actually paid - and if the rules to achieve this are set and enforced fairly to create a level playing field right across the world. There is no point in dealing with tax evasion in one country if the problem is simply displaced to another.’","Prime Minister to brief Business Advisory Council on tax clampdown .

Lord Tebbit suggested gay marriage should be extended to family members to avoid inheritance tax . Norman Tebbit has launched a foul-mouthed attack on David Cameron, claiming the Tory leader has ‘f***** things up’ by pressing ahead with gay marriage laws. The former party chairman’s extraordinary public criticism of the current leadership emerged after the Prime Minister was forced to rely on Labour support to rescue same-sex weddings. Lord Tebbit said the plans would create inconsistencies, and could be extended to help families avoid inheritance tax, declaring: ‘Maybe I’d be allowed to marry my son.’ But the plans to legalise gay marriage have tonight cleared the Commons, despite efforts by Tory backbenchers to derail the legislation. There was applause in the House after MPs voted by 366 to 161, a majority of 205, to give the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill a third reading. The legislation will go to the House of Lords after the half-term recess where it is expected to attract fierce opposition from peers, especially the bishops. Tonight's result is a marginal improvement for Mr Cameron on the vote at second reading when 175 MPs opposed the plans in a Commons vote. It also comes as a relief for Downing Street following a serious attempt yesterday by Tory former minister Tim Loughton to derail the Bill. Mr Loughton had tabled an amendment extending civil partnerships to straight couples - a move which ministers warned could have cost the Treasury an extra £4 billion in pension liabilities and scupper the chances of the Bill becoming law. But Labour - mindful they did not want to play any part in derailing the Bill - decided against supporting Mr Loughton - a move which would have seen the amendment pass - and offered the Government an 11th hour deal to immediately review the possibility of extending civil partnerships to straight couples. Culture Secretary Maria Miller accepted their amendment and Mr Loughton's amendment in the end was easily defeated. Mr Cameron’s leadership has been under sustained criticism for weeks, unable to suppress Tory mutiny over Europe and gay marriage. Last night he wrote to party activists to build bridges with them after a senior Tory figure reportedly called them ‘mad, swivel-eyed loons’. In an interview with the Big Issue Lord Tebbit said ministers had alienated traditional Tory voters. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured leaving Tory party headquarters in Millbank yesterday, is under pressure to repair relations with the grassroots . The party leadership had ‘f***ed things up’ and the UK Independence Party would pick up support as a result. A new opinion poll last night put UKIP just two points behind the Conservatives. Lord Tebbit added: ‘If [UKIP] make significant gains in the European elections, I know there’s people rich enough to get involved and fund a significant campaign at a general election.’ Discussing the impact of legalising gay marriage, Lord Tebbit suggested it be extended to family members. He said: ‘It’s like one of my colleagues said: we’ve got to make these same-sex marriages available to all. It would lift my worries about inheritance tax because maybe I’d be allowed to marry my son. Why not? ‘Why . shouldn’t a mother marry her daughter? Why shouldn’t two elderly . sisters living together marry each other? I quite fancy my brother!’ Lord Tebbit also questioned whether the gay marriage laws could cause chaos when combined with changes to the rules of succession, which would allow an older female heir to the throne to become monarch. ‘I said to a minister I know: “Have you thought this through? Because you’re doing the law of succession, too.” ‘When we have a queen who is a lesbian and she marries another lady and then decides she would like to have a child and someone donates sperm and she gives birth to a child, is that child heir to the throne?’ Lord Tebbit later admitted he had sworn during the interview. ‘It’s not the language I normally use, but during a long interview I may well have said it,’ he told The Times. Mr Cameron issued a love letter to Tory activists last night as UKIP closed to within two points in the opinion polls. The peace offering followed revelations that a senior ally of the Prime Minister had branded the party faithful ‘swivel-eyed loons’. MPs warn that his leadership is in peril amid discontent on Europe and gay marriage. The scale of the crisis was shown last night by a new poll that puts the Tories down five points on just 24 per cent, 11 behind Labour. UKIP – up six points in a month – was on 22 per cent, double the level of Lib Dem support. In his email to party members, Mr Cameron said: ‘We have been together through good times and bad. This is more than a working relationship; it is a deep and lasting friendship.’ Referring to reports that Tory co-chairman Lord Feldman – a tennis partner of Mr Cameron – had insulted them, he added: ‘ I am proud to lead this party. I am proud of what you do. And I would never have around me those who sneered or thought otherwise. ‘We are a team, from the parish council to the local association to Parliament, and I never forget it.’ The dire poll ratings will fuel the discontent of Tory MPs who warned yesterday the number prepared to force a leadership election has risen in recent days. If 46 write letters to Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, there would be a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron.","Former Tory chairman's foul-mouthed attack on party leadership .

A Utah man was put on notice by the federal government last month over his business where he physically mints digital currency. Mike Caldwell has spent years taking bitcoins - digital currency used in online transactions - and actually turning them into physical coins for online consumers. Caldwell's business model was simple: people would send him bitcoins over the Internet and he would send them back a physical, metal coin in the mail. Bitcoins: Mike Caldwell is suspending his bitcoin minting business after receiving a letter from the federal government . To spend a bitcoin, you need a secret key - a compilation of numbers and letters. So when Caldwell mints his physical bitcoins, he hides the key behind a tamper-resistant strip. According to Caldwell, he's minted the equivalent of roughly $82 million in bitcoins. That much business has put him on the federal government's radar and now his business of turning digital currency into physical coins could be coming to an end. In November, Caldwell got a letter from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FINCEN - an arm of the Treasury Department that interprets the nation's anti-money-laundering and financial crime regulations. Cha-ching: Caldwell charges about $50 for each bitcoin he mints for clients throughout the world . 'They considered my activity to . be money transmitting,' Caldwell tells Wired. To legally transfer money, there are a lot of regulations that must be followed, and Caldwell hasn't been following them. Since receiving the letter, Caldwell has stopped minting his coins and no longer is taking orders for his popular Casascius bitcoins. According to Caldwell, though, he doesn't think he transmits money - he doesn't accept any type of actual currency because he is paid in bitcoins. Uncle Sam: The Treasury Department's financial crimes bureau is looking into Caldwell's business . Caldwell charges about $50 per bitcoin but he's paid in digital currency. The coins he sends through the mail, he argues, are not actual money and should be viewed as collectibles. The feds, however, see things differently, and rather than cross Uncle Sam even further, Caldwell says he plans to fulfill his final few orders and then calling his lawyer before he continues to produce physical versions of digital money.","Mike Caldwell received a letter from the federal government telling him to stop minting bitcoins .

Facebook wants to become your new best friend by knowing everything about you - and it's going to happen whether you like it not. From the bottles of beer you drink, to the places you visit on vacation, the social networking site will compile everything there is to know about you (and the billion other people online) - and then make sense of it with the hope of selling better, targeted advertising in your news feed. The social networking giant has teamed up with New York University to set up a research lab designed to learn about artificial intelligence. Making sense of it all: Facebook unveiled plans on a partnership with New York University for a new centre for artificial intelligence, aimed at harnessing the huge social network's massive trove of data . The California-based social network giant is hiring professor Yann LeCun of NYU's Center for Data Science to head up a new artificial intelligence lab, aiming to use cutting-edge science to make Facebook more interesting and relevant. It would enable Facebook to learn more about individuals and ultimately  achieve better results for targeted ads and news feed improvements. For now, Facebook feeds may seem like a random jumble, but LeCun argues these 'can be improved by intelligent systems.' 'This could include things like ranking (the items in) news feeds, or determining the ads that are shown to users, to be more relevant,' LeCun said. Tell me everything: Facebook unveiled plans for a partnership with New York University for a new center for artificial intelligence, aimed at harnessing the huge social network's massive trove of data . 'Then there are things that are less directly connected, like analyzing content, understanding natural language and being able to model users... to allow them to learn new things, entertain them and help them achieve their goals.' Facebook is the world's biggest social network, but it faces the challenge of maintaining growth, keeping users engaged and delivering enough advertising to generate revenue growth without turning members off. LeCun said the new artificial intelligence lab would be the largest research facility of its kind in the world, though he declined to provide numbers. 'We're limited only by how many smart people there are in the world that we can hire,' the French-born mathematician and computer scientist said. The lab will be based in three locations -- New York, London and Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California. Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg: The goal here is to use new approaches in AI to help make sense of all the content that people share so we can generate new insights about the world to answer people's questions . But it will also be part of the broader artificial intelligence research community, according to LeCun, who starts his new job in January while keeping his NYU post. Facebook's move follows Google's forays into artificial intelligence, and notably its acquisition earlier this year of DNNresearch, a startup created by University of Toronto professor Geoffrey Hinton and two of his graduate students, known for computer models of brain functions, which includes pattern and speech recognition. Artificial intelligence can help computers 'think' in ways similar to humans and help solve problems. In one famous example, IBM's Watson computer beat human contestants in the TV trivia game 'Jeopardy.' Big tech companies are all working on artificial intelligence to varying degrees, said Greg Sterling, analyst at Opus Research. It's a somewhat 'loaded and elusive term,' he said, but it could 'power a range of consumer and enterprise-facing applications' -- even if Facebook doesn't quite know what those applications are yet. LeCun, the founding director of NYU's Center for Data Science, is known for creating an early version of a pattern-recognition algorithm that mimics in part the visual cortex of animals and humans. Research lab: Facebook is set to dedicate one full research laboratory for developing technologies in the Artificial Intelligence space. The California-based tech giant named professor Yann LeCun of NYU's Center for Data Science to head up the project . LeCun's recent research projects include the application of 'deep learning' methods for visual scene understanding, driverless cars and small flying robots, as well as speech recognition, and applications in biology and medicine. James Hendler, who heads the Rensselaer Institute for Data Exploration and Applications, said Facebook already uses some artificial intelligence algorithms for its 'social network graph,' but that applying these to photos, videos and other 'multimedia' data requires a boost in power. 'As they move into their own search and more of these new multimedia data types, they need more,' Hendler said. 'I expect that it will in the short term mainly focus on improving existing algorithms, for example better selection of what shows up in a user's Web feed. 'In the long run, we should see a lot more capabilities such as searching for photos of things one might be interested in, and more information in Facebook that results from your activities on other websites.' Facebook has acknowledged in recent weeks it has been tweaking user news feeds and the new investment signals more changes are coming. 'There's been a lot of speculation that people have been leaving Facebook because they are upset that the newsfeed filtering doesn't let them see a lot of the things they'd like to see from their friends,' Hendler said. 'The community has speculated for a while that Facebook would need to hire some AI researchers to help them solve this problem.'","Social network will analyze and then 'make sense' of shared content from photos to 'likes'

The Federal Communications Commission voted Thursday to consider allowing fliers to use phones during flights. The vote came despite overwhelming public opinion being against in-flight phone calls and three members of Congress and the Department of Transportation taking steps to block them. Can you hear me now?: Talking during flights may become a reality . Should in-flight cell phone calls be allowed? The divergent agendas of the two agencies are coming to a head as technology allowing in-flight calls is set to be deployed across the United States. Cell phone calls have not been allowed during flights for what both the government and airlines have claimed are technical reasons, but newer solutions being made available render that explanation obsolete. There have been rumblings in both directions over whether voice calls should be allowed during flights, but the FCC voted 3-2 in favour of at least considering lifting the ban. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx sees things differently and told CNN he is concerned about how fair it is to fliers to have to sit through flights filled with people barking into their cell phones. ‘Over the past few weeks, we have heard of concerns raised by airlines, travelers, flight attendants, members of Congress and others who are all troubled over the idea of passengers talking on cell phones in flight,’ he told the network in a statement. ‘I am concerned about this possibility as well,’ he added. Against the idea: An overwhelming majority of Americans want flight to remain without voice calls, but they are currently allowed while the plane is on the ground . The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates air travel, is under the DOT umbrella. The regulator is not only concerned with travel safety, but also consumer rights. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is spearheading the effort to study the feasibility of in flight calls. ‘I'm the last person in the world who wants to listen to someone talking to me while I fly across the country,’ he told a congressional panel Thursday, ‘but we are the technical agency, and we will make the rules for the way the new technology works.’ Simply allowing the technology to be used, he further argued, does not mean it will be mandated. ‘The proposal would not require airlines to either install such equipment, or to offer mobile wireless services aboard their aircraft,’ Mr Wheeler testified. ‘Airlines would be free, within the confines of the rules of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Department of Transportation (DOT), to make their own decisions,’ the chairman continued. FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who voted in favor of the idea, explained that silence may in the future come at a cost. ‘If we move beyond what we do here today and actually update our rules to allow voice calls on planes we can see a future where our quiet time is monetized and seating in the silent section comes at a premium.’ Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN), as well as House Rep. Bill Shuster, (R-PA) introduced bills to permanently block calls while in the air. A recent poll revealed how unenthused people are at the idea of voice calls during flights. Only 30 per cent of those polled were in favour of lifting the ban, according to researchers from Quinnipiac University. Even more surprisingly, only 39 per cent of those aged 18 to 29 wanted voice calls during flights. It is not clear if voice calls will be allowed during flights, but texting on planes - which most people are in favor of allowing - should be available early next year.","The Federal Communication Commission is moving to lift the ban while other parts of government are trying to keep it in place .

Unpopular: Eating Brussels sprouts could help those who are not eating five portions of fruit or vegetables a day, dieticians say . They may not taste great, but just one Brussels sprout provides enough folic acid to last all day, say dieticians. A daily helping of the traditional Christmas fare could boost the number of Britons eating five portions of fruit and vegetables, according to a new survey. It shows four out of five people fail to consume the recommended daily amount, which may leave them at risk of vitamin deficiencies. The average intake is just three portions and a third of the nation manages only one or two servings a day. But the poll of 3,000 people found many in denial about their five-a-day intake, with one in three claiming to eat a varied and balanced diet. Nutritionist Dr Emma Derbyshire, from the Health Supplements Information Service (HSIS) which carried out the poll, said anyone who averages only three portions of fruit or vegetables a day is at real risk of missing out on important vitamins and minerals. The B-vitamin folic acid, for example, keeps blood healthy, preventing anaemia, and is vital for women in the early stages of pregnancy and planning to conceive. She said ‘There is no doubt that, with the exception of vitamin D and folate, most of us should be able to get all the nutrients we need from a healthy and balanced diet. 'But all the evidence shows that very few people are actually eating the healthy, balanced diet needed to ensure the daily intake of vitamins and minerals we need to maintain good health. 'Our bodies cannot store folic acid so we need at least 0.2mg in our diet every day. 'To ensure this intake you would need to eat roughly two mugs of peas or 1.3 Brussels sprouts’ she added. The Department of Health recommends that any woman thinking of having a baby, those who are pregnant or breastfeeding and all children aged six months to five years should take a daily supplement. Christmas classic: Experts say people should eat a mug of the green veg to improve levels of folic acid . Despite clear evidence that taking folic acid before conception and during the first weeks of pregnancy cuts the risk of birth defects, two out of five people questioned thought it was not safe for mums-to-be to take any kind of food supplements. Dr Derbyshire said ‘These findings are very worrying. A healthy diet during pregnancy is essential for both mother and child. ‘There is no doubt that folic acid helping to reduce the incidence of spina bifida and other neural tube defects. ‘There is also evidence that taking a multivitamin during pregnancy reduces the odds of having a low birth weight baby. ‘This could have a life-long impact on health as low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes and heart disease as an adult.’ The findings on fruit and vegetable consumption come after European figures show on average Britons eat 258g of fruit and vegetables a day, little more than half the 400g recommended in international guidelines. ‘This research data is really very alarming’ said Dr Derbyshire. ‘It is clear, from this latest survey, that around 78 per cent of people are finding it difficult to consume at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. ‘As a result, there is a significant dietary gap which needs to be bridged to help people maintain their health’ she added.","Daily helping of Brussels sprouts would boost number of people eating five portions of fruit and veg a day, say experts .

There are ten characters at every staff Christmas party - and the 'Kisser' is the least popular of them all, according to new research. Faces at work bashes may change over years but the 10 personality types - including the Peak-too-sooner, Flirt, Blabbermouth, Weeper and Limpet - are ever-present. Every one of the millions of British office Christmas parties will follow an almost formulaic pattern, and each one will feature their very own archetypal characters, says the study. A new stud says while faces may change over years, the Peak-too-sooner and Flirt are ever-present . Almost seven in ten (69 per cent) of those surveyed said the Christmas Kisser is the biggest nuisance - and they do everything they can to avoid them. 'We've been hosting Christmas staff parties for nearly 40 years at Browns and despite the changing fads and fashions, we've seen just about everything in that time,' says a spokesman for bar and brasserie chain Browns, who commissioned the report. 'The faces may change as quickly as the music at these staff parties but one thing is constant - the 10 staff party characters who are present. 'Never is that more obvious than at the annual staff Christmas party. These character traits seem common at every staff party we've hosted since we were established in the 1970s. 'We reckon everyone can name someone who fits each of these categories our experts have devised. And everyone has their own Christmas Kisser - that one person who just won't take no for an answer and is determined to kiss every single person at the event. They're the least popular person at every Christmas party.' The Christmas Kisser . In their late-30s or early 40s, 'happily' married with children, still insists on wearing ultra-skinny jeans and is convinced that, despite their advancing years, they could still have their wicked way with any of the office bright young things at the drop of a hat. Will be spotted stalking the office Christmas bash like a shark on legs looking for stragglers. Beware their slobbery chops, they come with their own horror movie soundtrack. The Peak-too-sooner . This man or woman is the office Christmas party evangelist. They help round up the troops in advance of the annual bash and make wild promises of incredible party feats and promises of being the last-man or woman standing at the after-party shindig. Unfortunately, they are then found just 90 minutes into the festive bash, candle well and truly burnt at both ends, snoozing quietly in the corner. The Christmas Kisser thinks they could have their wicked way with the office bright young (l) and The Flirt has made you the target of their inappropriate advances for the duration of the evening (r) The Flirt . You've had your suspicions about this staff member all year and, as the Christmas party celebrations start to unfold, they confirm your worst fears - they've made you the target of their inappropriate advances for the duration of the evening. They start off the night pleasantly enough - innocently offering to buy you a drink - but then suddenly turn, shunning every other member of staff and focus their attention solely on you (or a particularly inappropriate part of your body). They make lewd suggestions almost as an after-thought, sit uncomfortably close to you and growl at other members of their sex who have the misfortune of straying innocently into your vicinity throughout the evening. The Blabbermouth . They've been the picture of discretion all year, hiding their simmering discontent at not getting that pay-rise or failing in that promotion behind a facade of normality. But once the festive spirit takes them, their lips become loose and they begin to announce, at an inconsidered and raised volume, how rubbish it is working at their company. They also suddenly find it impossible to maintain company secrets or private disclosures. Nothing is out of bounds and, before the end of the evening, any confidential company business is suddenly common knowledge among the entire workforce. Often found at the root of any Christmas party squabbles. The Houdini . Often best-friends with the Peak-too-sooner and the Organiser, the Houdini seems well up for plenty of festive frolics in the lead-up to the staff Christmas do. They often go as far as helping organise venues for the hardy party animals to go to after the main event has subsided. Unfortunately, this party 'type' is usually never around when the after-party begins, having sloped off home for an early night and a mug of Horlicks discreetly while the rest of the workforce is still in full party mode. Usually in their early 30s and often a new parent or horribly infatuated with their lover. The Dark Horse . Quiet as a mouse all year round this pinstriped staff member suddenly, frighteningly finds their outrageous inner self at the Christmas party. While they wouldn't say boo to a goose in normal office hours they suddenly think it is perfectly acceptable to go round helping themselves to colleagues' drinks and dancing inappropriately close to members of the opposite sex. They're also likely to announce that they used to be lead singer in a death metal band once they'd quit their job as a dancer at a seedy revue bar. Often to be found working the floor in tandem with The Flirt. The Limpet . The Limpet is irremovably welded to the side of their departmental boss . You can easily spot this s(h)elfish staff member at the Christmas party because they are irremovably welded to the side of their departmental boss. They'll be the one heartily laughing at their boss's awful jokes, cooing cringefully at their boss's development plan and happily skipping off to the bar and buying their boss drinks all night out of their own pocket. They'll also be the one left looking heartbroken as their boss exits the party early without hearing their full 14-part eulogy to their boss's greatness, written in staggering techni-coloured fawning detail (in their own blood). Often to be found at the end of the night in the toilets, attempting to outcry The Weeper. The Weeper . The staff member who steadfastly, resolutely refuses to leave their personal problems at the door to the Christmas party venue. They wear their heart on their sleeve and spread their misty-eyed romantic delusions of love through snotty tear-stained tissues thrust into the clammy hands of colleagues unfortunate enough to aimlessly wander into the toilets while The Weeper is mid-shriek over the untimely ending of their torrid love affair with Tommy, the butcher's son. They cry so much and so often at Christmas parties that The Organiser has stopped booking them a seat at the annual dinner table and has simply arranged for them to be hooked up to the water mains in order to replenish lost hydration. The Dancer . The Dancer will bust all manner of old-skool moves at the office party . Always a decade beyond their prime, The Dancer will bust all manner of old-skool moves at the office party following years of secret attendance at their local community centre's disco-dancing classes. Thought you'd seen the last of the hand-jive? Oh no you haven't. And you've never ever seen anyone under the age of 25 attempt that backflip into a John Travolta strut before. This staff member will not vacate the dance floor - tonight it is their personal stage and the masses of open-mouthed colleagues sitting around the vicinity of the dance floor are their greatest audience. Also available for christenings, bah mitzvahs and evening wedding receptions. The Organiser . Woe betide anyone who decides to change their Christmas dinner choice at the staff party or bemoans the quality of the venue, The Organiser will be firmly, angrily on your case. This diminutive staff member has spent years scaring the pants off the biggest characters in the staff canteen, honing their withering Paddington stare to perfection. They have a list of everything (including other lists) and have arranged the staff party with military precision. No matter you have just ordered a full round of drinks for you and your colleagues, if The Organiser says it is time to move on, you move on. No argument, you shuffle into the dining room and leave your drinks behind (they're banned from this room because The Organiser has arranged special Christmas cocktails to be served).","Each party has 10 types including Peak-too-sooner, Flirt and Blabbermouth .

A Meijer store employee in Gaylord, Michigan was recently fired for helping put out a fire in the store's parking lot. David Bowers was greeting customers at the front of the store last month when a shopper came up to him, saying his car was on fire . So Mr Bowers grabbed a fire extinguisher and left his post to put out the flames. Soon after he returned to his positions and continued his work. Good Samaritan sacked: David Bowers was fired as a greeter from a Meijer store in Michigan when he left his post at the front of the store to help a customer put out a fire in the parking lot . Breaking the rules? Store management let Mr Bowers go for not adhering to company policy. Above, a picture of the torched car Mr Bowers helped save . But it wasn't long before he was called into the store director's office where he was told he was being put on suspension. 'The one supervisor  told me that my heart was in the right place, but my brain wasn't' Mr Bowers told UpNorthLive. Mr Bowers was officially fired later that week for 'not following company policy'. 'I thought that was what we were supposed to do. You know, you have somebody that is in need, don't you help them? But I guess not,' Mr Bowers said. Mr Bowers admits that he was put on suspension once before - for chasing a shoplifter out of the store. Since he was let go, Mr Bowers has been unable to find another job. Unemployed: Mr Bowers hasn't been able to find another job since getting fired from Meijer . Responding to criticism that Mr Bowers shouldn't have been fired, the company issued a statement to MLive.com, saying it 'was not a random decision'. 'We have well-established safety procedures for emergency situations and we train all team members on those procedures. These procedures help ensure the safety of everyone – both customers and team members, and our team members know there are consequences when they don’t follow them.' One customer especially peeved about Mr Bower's termination is the shopper he helped that day, Ken Kuzon. He says his car would have completely burned out if Mr Bowers didn't come to his aid. 'I just think it's ridiculous. Why should you be penalized for being a Good Samaritan?' Kuzon asked. And now the situation is turning into a PR nightmare for the company, as patrons have been posting on the store's Facebook page in protest and calling for Mr Bowers to get his job back. Thankful: Customer Ken Kuzon says his car would have been lost if Mr Bowers hadn't helped him put out the fire . 'Last night I pulled into your Gaylord Meijer's parking lot to do my weekly shopping. I thought about how David Bowers was always there to greet me and my 4-year-old and cheer her on while she played the claw game at your entrance,' wrote Pamela LaGuttata. 'Although I shop there almost exclusively, I reconsidered my decision to support your store and drove to Wal-Mart. I hope that you will reconsider your decision in the firing of a Good Samaritan.' Patron Randy Klepper said he read about the story in the local paper and questions how the store's founder, the late Frederik Meijer, would have dealt with the same situation. 'It tells me not to ever get hit by a car or have a heart attack in their parking lot. It would evidently be against company policy to get any help from a employee. Meijer should be ashamed for not wanting to have their staff help out in those type of situation...HE SHOULD GET HIS JOB BACK,' Mr Klepper wrote.","David Bowers was a store greeter at a Meijer in Gaylord, Michigan .

A meningitis outbreak at Princeton University last month prompted health officials to provide students with an unapproved vaccine to protect against the rare strain of the disease, and now parents at a university on the other side of the country - where there is a similar outbreak - are asking why their kids haven't been given the same vaccine. The strain of meningitis that hit Princeton is meningococcal type B. So far, eight students have been diagnosed with the dangerous disease at the Ivy League school. At University of California Santa Barbara, four students have been infected, including one who had to have his feet amputated. Vaccine: An unapproved meningitis vaccine was given to Princeton students to protect against an outbreak of the deadly diseas . University of California freshmen Aaron Loy, 18, has had his feet amputated after being sickened in a meningitis outbreak at UC Santa Barbara . There currently is no vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for that particular strain of meningitis in the U.S. But there is in Europe, Australia and Canada. So health officials approved the import of the vaccine for Princeton students. UC Santa Barbara students didn't get the same approval. 'I'm very concerned and upset about [Centers for Disease Control's] response,' Jeff Klonoff, who has two children who attend UC Santa Barbara, told . ABC News. 'In UCSB, there has been four [infections] in the last month. If there's an explanation for why they're treating them differently, . they haven't conveyed that.' Outbreak: Since March, eight students at Princeton University have been diagnosed with the rare disease . Health officials say that they tend to only consider vaccination when there is an ongoing threat that people will catch a particular disease. 'We consider vaccinating when there's a sustained outbreak and ongoing . transmission, and it looks like there's a continuing risk for the . students,' said Dr. Thomas Clark, chief of the meningitis branch at the . CDC. 'If you look back at the meningitis [strain B] outbreaks we've . seen, out of the 13 we looked at, 11 [outbreaks] were four cases or . fewer.' Additionally, Clark said that the CDC needs to make sure that the vaccine would even work against the strain of the disease at UC Santa Barbara, since it's unclear whether the two strains are identical - while the diseases are similar, they might have different 'genetic fingerprints.' At UC Santa Barbara, there have been four cases of meningitis, including one student who had to have his feet amputated . 'All the data so far suggests that [the imported vaccine] would work against this strain, but then we [need to] test this actual bacteria that caused the cases,' said Clark.Clark said the CDC would continue to monitor the situation. If the situation worsens, he said, health officials would consider approving the vaccine for UC Santa Barbara students.","Since March, eight people have been diagnosed with meningitis at Princeton .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:15 EST, 13 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:18 EST, 13 December 2013 . Christmas in Alaska came early this week to nearly 300 students attending school in the Yup'ik Eskimo village of Kwethluk. Thanks to the volunteer program coordinated by the Alaska National Guard, Santa and Mrs. Claus greeted children in the western Alaska community and took pictures with them before helper elves handed out gifts. 'Santa and Mrs. Claus is not something that normally happens out there for them. It's commonplace for us here in Anchorage or the bigger towns to be able to go to the malls and see Santa,' said Jo Katkus, the chairwoman of Operation Santa Claus, as she and 24 other volunteers waited early Wednesday morning at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to load a military C130 cargo plane for the 300 mile flight. The Big Red One: Santa and Mrs. Claus getting off a small airplane to visit the children at the school. The visit is part of the Alaska National Guard's Operation Santa Claus, which visits several remote Alaska Native villages each year . What do you want this year? Children at the school in Kwethluk, Alaska, standing in line to Santa and Mrs. Claus . 'For them, it's a real extra treat,' she said. The fact the visit even happened is a testament to the adaptability of Alaskans, whose flight plans change at any given moment because of weather or mechanical issues. Flying — oftentimes in bad weather — is required in Alaska since most of communities are off the state's limited road system. The original plan was to fly the volunteers in the military transport to the western Alaska hub community of Bethel, and then take the National Guard's Blackhawk helicopter the last 12 miles to Kwethluk. But a mechanical issue grounded the helicopter, making it appear the program's second scheduled visit to the Yup'ik community would be a bust. A mechanical failure doomed a planned visit last month. Tears of joy: Alaina David, 2, crying while having her photo taken with Santa . Look what I got! Megan Fisher, 6, displaying the gift she got from Santa and Mrs. Claus . The visit was part of the Alaska National Guard's Operation Santa Claus, which visits several remote Alaska Native villages each year . Instead of giving up, 10-year program veteran Dina Banez went to the armory's waiting area and dug out her cellphone. Within minutes, she found a local air taxi company, Grant Aviation, willing to donate a flight to take about a third of the volunteers and gifts to Kwethluk, despite wind gusts of up to 50 mph. This wasn't even the most creative fix she and others have come up with since the program began in 1956. They try to visit three remote Alaska villages every year. 'We've gone on dog sled from different villages, snowmachines, ATVs, pickup trucks, whatever it is. We adapt and overcome, and it's all to make the kids' Christmas and bring a little joy to them,' Banez said. Banez and others applauded when the pilot set the small commuter plane down on the airstrip outside Kwethluk. The visitors arriving in the school multipurpose room, where lunch was just finishing up, created a buzz throughout the school — not to mention the entire community after an announcement was sent village-wide. Gifts: (Left) A volunteer holding an orange and an apple, which was the last gift presented to the children.  (Right) A box of books that were presented to the kids along with Christmas presents . Remote: Kwethluk is a Yupik village on the Kwethluk River just upstream from the Kuskokwim River in western Alaska. Just over 700 people live there . The great outdoors: Boats make their way along tributaries of the Kuskokwim River. The river is the main transportation corridor for the village of Kwethluk . 'Not only the kids and the parents came, but we had the elders and a lot of the community members participating, as well,' said assistant principal Zach Bastoky, who was wearing a green kupsuk, a traditional Alaska Native smock made for him by another instructor. Everyone was excited 'because we hardly get Operation Santa, and it's fun for the kids,' said senior Alicia Michael, 17. Teachers, some speaking in English, others in Yup'ik, paraded their students into the gym, where photos were taken with Santa and Mrs. Claus. Some of the smaller children had broad smiles on their faces, others left Santa's lap in tears, but those soon dried up as they lined up to receive their gifts. 'They get scared, some of them, the first time seeing him (Santa),' said parent Roy Michael, adding the program is good not only for children, but families.

Welcome to Santa's grotto, Alaska style: Assistant principal Zach Bastoky (in green kupsuk) waiting to hand out gifts to children after they had their pictures taken with Santa and Mrs. Claus in the school gym . Students returned to their classroom, only to be replaced by older students. The Salvation Army helped arrange for gifts for all children, up through age 18. Since two-thirds of the volunteers remained in Bethel, plans had to be changed on the fly. After the older kids received their presents, the younger children came back to receive more gifts. The children got backpacks filled with school supplies, toys, toothbrushes and floss. Long gone are the days when children received bags of candy, and the toothbrushes are intended to promote good dental care in rural Alaska, where there are few dentists. Children were also given a book, which Banez said is the highlight for many children, and received an apple and an orange each on the way out of the gym — a treasure in western Alaska, where fresh fruit is an expensive luxury.
