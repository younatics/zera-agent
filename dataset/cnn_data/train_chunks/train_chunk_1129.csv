"Mistake: Former Home Secretary says the 2004 decision was 'well-intentioned' but 'messed up' Jack Straw has admitted that throwing open Britain’s borders to Eastern European migrants was a ‘spectacular mistake’. The former Home Secretary said Labour’s 2004 decision to hand immediate working rights to Poles and migrants from other new EU states was a ‘well-intentioned policy we messed up’. His comments emerged on the same day as his successor as Home Secretary, David Blunkett, warned that the influx of Roma migrants into Britain risked causing riots. Mr Blunkett’s comments reinforced the significance of Mr Straw’s admission about Labour’s failure to anticipate the scale of migration when eight former Soviet bloc nations became EU members, and Britain – almost alone in Europe – allowed the free movement of workers between countries. At the time, the Government predicted up to 13,000 migrants would come to Britain each year. The actual total over nearly a decade was more than a million. Virtually every other EU state, apart from Ireland and Sweden, kept their jobs markets closed for the seven years permitted. In an article for his local paper, the Lancashire Telegraph, Mr Straw – who is MP for Blackburn – admitted the forecasts were ‘worthless’. And he accepted the ‘social dislocation’ which can be caused when ‘large numbers of people from abroad settle in a particular area’. Mr Straw said: ‘One spectacular mistake in which I participated (not alone) was in lifting the transitional restrictions on the Eastern European states like Poland and Hungary which joined the EU in mid-2004. ‘Other existing EU members, notably France and Germany, decided to stick to the general rule which prevented migrants from these new states from working until 2011. 'But we thought that it would be good for Britain if these folk could come and work here from 2004. Not alone: Mr Straw's successor David Blunkett (left) has also spoken out about problems caused by immigration, warning that Roma migrants could cause riots. Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right) applauded him . It is estimated that more than 700,000 people from Romania could try to find work and settle in Britain . ‘Thorough research by the Home Office . suggested that the impact of this benevolence would in any event be . “relatively small, at between 5,000 and 13,000 immigrants per year up to . 2010”. Events proved these forecasts worthless. ‘Net migration reached close to a quarter of a million at its peak in 2010. Lots of red faces, mine included.’ Also critical: Last year Ed Miliband said Labour's policy left communities 'struggling to cope' His comments are the furthest any senior Labour figure has gone in accepting the party made serious errors in immigration policy during its time in power. Mr Blunkett told the BBC that Roma groups from Slovakia who had settled in a district of Sheffield were behaving like they were living in a ‘downtrodden village or woodland’ where there were no toilets or litter collections. They were dumping rubbish on the streets, loitering late at night and causing ‘friction’ with residents, he added. The tensions have prompted existing residents of the Page Hall area to set up street patrols to try to combat the anti-social behaviour. Since 2004, several hundred Roma families have settled in the area, many with eight children or more. Mr Blunkett said: ‘We have got to change the behaviour and the culture of the incoming Roma community – because there’s going to be an explosion otherwise. 'We have got to be tough and robust in saying to people, “you are not living in a downtrodden village or woodland” – because many of them don’t live in areas where there are toilets or refuse collection facilities.’ Mr Blunkett said the ‘understandable tensions’ between different groups could lead to a repeat of the 2001 riots in Oldham and Bradford. 'If everything exploded, if things went wrong, the community would obviously be devastated. We saw this in Bradford, Burnley and Oldham all those years ago when I first became Home Secretary.’ Back track: Mr Straw wrote in his local newspaper that the decision was made based on data showing 5,000 to 13,000 migrants a year would come to Britain. 'Events proved these forecasts worthless'. Tough: Support for the Labour party hit a three-year low in 2004 following the immigration announcement . Mr Blunkett’s comments were welcomed by Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who said they reinforced the need for a re-think over the dropping of similar border controls with Romania and Bulgaria on January 1 next year. Immigration campaigners have predicted the arrival of up to 50,000 people a year as a result of ending the transitional controls over nationals from the two countries. Romania has one of the largest Roma populations in Europe, with an estimated two million living there. Last year Ed Miliband was criticised for dropping an admission that Labour’s policy had left communities across Britain ‘struggling to cope’. In advance of a speech in December, his spin doctors suggested he would admit that the party’s failures on immigration had damaged Britain and increased community tensions. 'The Home Office suggested the impact would be relatively small... between 5,000 and 13,000 migrants a years. Events proved these forecasts worthless' - Jack Straw in his local newspaper . He had been expected to say: ‘We did too little to tackle the realities of segregation in communities that were struggling to cope.’ But the admission was dropped in favour of a vague acknowledgment that the party had made ‘mistakes’. Mr Straw’s comments will prompt further calls for Labour to apologise for its failure on immigration. Mr Farage said: ‘Mr Blunkett should be admired for the courage he has shown by speaking so plainly. ‘The fact that he is talking of the significant difficulties with the Roma population already in his constituency should be taken seriously by the likes of Cameron, Clegg and Miliband. 'My question is if they won’t listen to the dangers of opening the door to Romania and Bulgaria next year when Ukip speak out on it, will they listen to David Blunkett?’ A recent Salford University study suggested Britain’s population of Roma – estimated at 200,000 – is one of the largest in Western Europe.","Former Home Secretary said the party's 2004 decision to hand immediate working rights to migrants from other EU states was a mistake .

"Researchers have claimed Earth is 60 million years older than previously thought. Our planet was believed to have formed approximately 100 million years after the solar system started to take shape 4.6 billion years ago, but scientists now say it was actually closer to just 40 million years. They came to the conclusion by analysing ancient gases in quartz, which showed astronomers had underestimated the timing of the impact that formed the moon - and in turn the age of Earth. Scientists know Earth was born from a disk of dust and gas about 4.6 billion years ago (artist's illustration shown), but the exact timing of this is unknown. New research suggests it may have occurred just 40 million years after the solar system formed, 60 million years older than initially thought . The research was presented by geochemists from the University of Lorraine in Nancy, France to the Goldschmidt Geochemistry Conference in Sacramento, California. Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is . debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and . an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The . colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek . Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. They discovered an isotopic signal that indicates previous age estimates for both the Earth and the moon need to be revised. Calculating exact dates that far back, however, is no mean feat. Looking back into 'deep time' it becomes more difficult to put a date on early Earth events. In part, this is because there is little 'classical geology' dating from the time of the formation of the Earth, such as an absence of rock layers from that era. So geochemists rely on other methods to estimate early Earth events. One of the standard techniques is measuring the changes in the proportions of different gases (isotopes) which survive from the early Earth - but even this only gives an estimate. 'It’s not possible to give an exact date for the formation of the Earth,' said Dr Guillaume Avice of the University of Lorraine. 'The oldest rocks of the solar system have been dated to 4,568 million years ago - so Earth is younger than that. 'What this work does is show Earth is older than we thought - by around 60 million years.' The new findings were made by studying xenon gas that had been trapped in quartz crystals (stock image shown) in South Africa and Australia. The findings showed that the giant imapct that is thought to have created the moon must have happened about 60 million years earlier, meaning Earth is also similarly older . The study resets the clock for the . collision between Earth’s ancestor and a planet-sized object that led to . the formation of the moon. The scientists analysed xenon gas found in quartz from South Africa and Australia which had been dated to 3.4 and 2.7 billion years respectively. The gas sealed in this mineral is preserved like a time capsule - allowing comparisons of the current isotopic ratios of xenon with those that existed billions of years ago. Recalibrating dating techniques using the ancient gas allowed them to refine the estimate of when Earth began to form. This allowed them to calculate the moon-forming impact is around 60 million years older than had been thought - give or take 20 million years. Earth and the moon are pictured here by the Galileo spacecraft on 16 December 1992. After the planet was struck by a Mars-sized object, debris surrounded Earth and eventually became the moon, which is tidally locked to our planet, meaning the same face always points our way . 'The composition of the gases we are looking at changes according to the conditions they are found in - which of course depend on the major events in Earth’s history,' continued Dr Avice. 'The gas sealed in these quartz samples has been handed down to us in a sort of time capsule. 'We are using standard methods to compute the age of Earth but having access to these ancient samples gives us new data and allows us to refine the measurement. 'The xenon gas signals allow us to calculate when the atmosphere was being formed, which was probably at the time Earth collided with a planet-sized body leading to the formation of the moon. 'Our results mean that both Earth and the moon are older than we had thought.' Previously the time of formation of the Earth’s atmosphere had been estimated at around 100 million years after the solar system formation. As the atmosphere would not have survived the moon-forming impact this revision puts the age up to 40 million years after the solar sytem formation - so around 60 million years older than previously thought. Co-researcher Dr Bernard Marty said: 'This might seem a small difference - but it’s important. 'These differences set time boundaries on how the planets evolved - especially through the major collisions in deep time which shaped the solar system.'","Researchers in France have revealed what they claim to be Earth's new age .

"David Luiz is having a medical with Paris Saint-Germain staff ahead of the sensational deal that will cost the French superpower close to £50million. The transfer of the 27-year-old Chelsea star will be the world's most expensive for a defender, beating the previous two highest fees - both paid by PSG, for Marquinhos and Thiago Silva.

Sportsmail's Lee Clayton and Alex Kay visited David Luiz's home in February 2013 to interview the Chelsea star and QPR goalkeeper Julio Cesar ahead of the England v Brazil friendly at Wembley. PSG believe they are capturing one of the most stylish defensive players in the world and they are flexing their financial muscle again in what will be the first major transfer of a busy World Cup summer. The previous best deal received by an English club for a defender was when Rio Ferdinand left Leeds for Manchester United for £30m 12 years ago. This deal will dwarf that British record transfer. Sources in Paris have confirmed PSG had to move quickly to beat Barcelona and Bayern Munich which may explain the size of the fee they were prepared to pay. Chelsea will use the money to rebuild their squad next season, with Diego Costa top of their wishlist. Their decision to sell comes quickly after John Terry agreed a new contract.

"He wants his just desserts: Alex Snelson is suing because his diet dows not allow him to eat processed foods he is being forced to eat, but does allow ice cream . A Satanic inmate has filed a federal lawsuit accusing his Nevada jailers of violating his constitutional rights by denying him meals adhering to his strict pagan diet. Alex C. Snelson, 33, argues in the lawsuit that denying him meals without byproducts and processing additives force him to either starve or go against his religion. He lists ice cream as being one of those foods. Snelson made the accusations in a hand-written complaint filed to the U.S. District Court in Reno, and insisted ice cream is one of the 'whole foods' his religion permits him to eat. He claims deputies retaliated against him by refusing him ice cream because they said it would violate his religion. 'Each day that I am effectively forced to eat outside my religious dietary guidelines is a day that I must endure feeling totally and utterly violated, tortured and religiously defiled,' Snelson wrote. The devil horn tattooed criminal was homeless and unemployed when he was arrested in 2013. He is serving two to six years in state . prison for possession of a stolen car after spending time in the Washoe . County Jail in Reno for possession of methamphetamine and brass . knuckles. He said the violation of his First Amendment rights caused him to suffer at the county jail. He's seeking 'hedonic' and 'vindictive' damages as well as monetary and punitive damages. County prosecutors said Friday they hadn't seen the new filing and had no comment. County spokesman Bob Harmon said it is the policy of the jail operated by the sheriff's office to 'accommodate the religious practices of all inmates.' Mr. Snelson's allegations are just that — allegations, and we are confident that the facts will show that the Washoe County Sheriff's Office acted in accordance with constitutional requirements,# Harmon said Friday. The filing: The lawsuit was filed with a handwritten compliant explaining how Snelson feels his rights have been violated . Washoe County Deputy District Attorney Mary Kandaras said in court filings in March that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has held previously that such claims must be 'rooted in religious belief' not in 'purely secular' philosophical concerns. 'Determining if a prisoner's claim is 'rooted in religious belief' requires analyzing whether the prisoner's claim is related to his sincerely held religion's belief,' she said in a motion requesting that Snelson be required to explain his beliefs. Kandaras said Snelson's original lawsuit filed in August didn't identify any specific religion, the content of his diet, whether his diet was recognized by the tenets of his religion or if he simply made it up. Snelson, who is acting as his own attorney, said in the amended suit he is a full, active and participating member of the pagan religion Satanism. 'I use my diet to purify and cleanse my internal organs,' he said, adding that the 'religious dietary restrictions that have been imposed on me by my church and by my religion and by my faith.' Where it happened: The Nevada State Prison, outside Reno, is where Snelson is being held . Snelson said he is a member of the Church of Light in Chino Hills, California. There is no readily available record of such a church existing . A leader of a leading international Satanic organization also questioned Snelson's claims. The Church of Satan, founded in San Francisco in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey, allows its members 'to choose whatever diet is pleasing to them,' said Magus Peter H. Gilmore, a high priest at the church. The church website says it is the 'original Church of Satan' dedicated to the 'acceptance of man's nature as an animal living in a cosmos that is indifferent to his existence.' It adds that Satanism is 'not Devil worship. There is no belief in God, Satan, the soul, the supernatural or in any form of afterlife.' Devotees are permitted to enjoy ice cream.","Alex Snelson claims he can eat only 'whole foods' without byproducts or processing additives .

"It's a touching tribute that was put together by a complete stranger. But a video that collates the final Tweets of a girl purportedly dying of terminal brain cancer - posting on her social media site right up until her death - has been the cause of plenty tears this weekend. While there remains some debate over the authenticity of the Tweets and the possibility the account is a hoax, the ever-increasing amount of viewers don't seem to care based on the message the clip is leaving with people. There is no last name attached to the Twitter handle of 'Amanda' (@TrappedAtMyDesk), which chronicles the musings of a young woman who moves to Ottawa, Canada, works for the government, discovers she's sick and then dies from her illness. However the four-minute video - which brings together a snapshot of Amanda's final five months - is showing people how short life is and what we might take for granted. Touching: Twitter user 'Amanda' (left) documented the last few months of her life on her social media site after discovering she had a brain tumor. Blogger and mom Shannon McKarney (right) gathered all the Tweets together and made a video of them as a tribute to Amanda's life and a reminder of our own . See video here . And, with many noticing that Amanda's death is dated April 2013, it's a stark reminder of the need to pay more attention to those around us, because these haunting posts are only really being noticed now. 'That's the main thing that struck me,' said the creator of the video, blogger and stay-at-home mom Shannon McKarney stated in her blog zchamu.com. 'I never met her, but her story stayed with me. 'I kept going back and reading her tweet stream, wishing I had reached out when she was alive. 'But I missed the chance. She was gone.' The video was initially made for a presentation for a digital strategy conference but, after recently posting it online, McKarney realized how quickly it was resonating with people. However McKarney's attempts to verify Amanda's story have so far been unsuccessful, despite her attempts to reach out to family members and friends using her video, blog and social. 'You can’t verify anything online, but I chose to take it at face value because there’s nothing else to be done,' McKarney said. The beginning: The tone of 'Amanda's# Twitter feed began to change in early January when she started worrying about a forthcoming doctors appointment . This is the moment Amanda finds out she has advanced glioblastoma multiforme - a brain tumor . Amanda discusses quitting her job with only a few months to live . 'It is a moving story. ... I believe that she was an individual, and I believe that her life mattered.' McKarney also said the story said alot about social media and the world we live in. 'It used to be that you would just find batches of letters in somebody’s attic, and you would read their history that way,' she said. 'Now we leave these digital traces behind us everywhere we go — tweets and Facebook posts and blog posts — and it really stayed with me that some day that may be the only way that people can get to know you and the person that you were.' The @TrappedAtMyDesk account produced almost 170 tweets, and states that Amanda was in Ottawa, according to The Ottawa Citzen. The feed was launched in November 2009, with: 'Figuring out twitter. How do I find more people in Ottawa?' However early last year, everything changed. 'My doctors office just called me to come in to discuss some test results. That can only be bad, right? The (sic) don’t call unless its (sic) bad news,' the writer stated on January 14, 2013. After finishing up her job, Amanda said she went on a trip, but had to return she when started to get sick . Final three: These are the official last Tweets on Amanda's Twitter account . By January 18, the writer referred to test results: 'advanced glioblastoma multiforme.' (brain tumor) The next the account statedL 'Deciding what to do for the rest of my life.' Then on January 21: 'I just resigned from my #goc (Government of Canada) job. No point when I have 3mths to live, right? I wonder if I’ll get my pension money.' There were no tweets for a couple of months, until the writer stated in March that she’d gone travelling and returned home after she started to get sick. On April 10, the writer stated: 'Don’t spend time being angry at people. Forgive them. Life is entirely too short.' The last post came that day: 'Tomorrow, I go back into the hospital for the last time. Thank you all for the good vibes. Be good to each other. #quietlastnight' The next and final tweet from the account was apparently written by someone named James on April 15. 'My dear little sister Amanda passed away from brain cancer late last night,' it says. Heartbreaking: Someone purporting to be Amanda's brother, named James, announces that she has died .","Twitter user known only as 'Amanda' revealed on her account in January 2013 she had a brain tumor and would soon die .
The account stated her death occurred three months later in April .
During that time Amanda continued to Tweet her thoughts while aware of her fate in short but heartfelt posts .
Now blogger Shannon McKarney - who didn't know Amanda - has found and pieced together the Tweets alongside music for a YouTube video that is touching people all over the world ."
"Dozing in a mother's lap, eyes half-closed, or throwing their arms around a father's shoulders in a great hug — every child craves a parent's affection. For Sirga the lioness, it is no different. Though, in this case, her parent is a human. Conservationist Valentin Gruener, 27, co‑founder of the Modisa Wildlife Project in the Kalahari, Botswana, has his hands full with the three-year-old lioness he has raised almost from birth. Now a teenager in lion years, Sirga is preparing to live in the wild — and surrogate parent Valentin is teaching her to hunt. Scroll down for video . Friends for life: The story of the abandoned lion cub Sirga who was raised by a German wildlife enthusiast in his 20s was one of the most shared stories on social media last year . Sirga was found close to death on a farm, in February 2012, after a litter of three cubs was born to a pride of lions. Two of the babies died and the third was abandoned by the adults. Working with a vet, Valentin put the tiny animal, weighing just 4lb, on a drip to combat severe dehydration. Over the next few days, he experimented with a recipe to fatten her up, until he hit upon a mixture of fresh eggs, cream, milk, vitamins, sunflower oil and calcium. 'To this day we believe she is probably the most spoiled and well-fed lion in Botswana,' he laughs. Within a year, she had put on 175lb, was weaned and was eating raw meat. Valentin, born in Germany, and his fellow conservationist, Mikkel Legarth from Denmark, were determined to help Sirga return to the wild, and have been coaching her to hunt. That meant hours spent teaching her to stalk and kill — skills which are not wholly instinctive and which cubs typically learn from the adults in their pride. 'We didn't want Sirga to become like other lions in captivity, constantly fed by streams of tourists,' says Mikkel. 'She hunts her own food, taking antelopes, and she will let us be near her when she eats it, which is remarkable. 'We want to release her eventually as a wild lion, not as one who has met lots of people. That would be dangerous. She only interacts with me and Valentin.' Best buds: Conservationist Valentin Gruener, 27, raised Sirga after she was abandoned by her pride . New challenge: A documentary series follows Sirga and Mr Gruener as he teaches her how to hunt . Realising that they were developing a unique bond with Sirga, the two naturalists invited filmmaker Jurgen Jozefowicz in, and a six part series called Lionheart will be released later this year. The film shows how Sirga nuzzles and even hugs her human 'parents', and will allow them to scratch her tummy or rub her jaws. She keeps her claws sheathed during play sessions and lies with her head contentedly on Valentin's lap while he strokes her ears. Most of us can only imagine the thrill of raising a lion from a cub. But John Partridge, senior curator of animals at Bristol Zoo Gardens, and his team have shared a similar experience over the past two years. As Sirga does not have a pride to teach her how to hunt, Mr Gruener has to get down and dirty and show her . In order to teach her how to live as a wild lion, Mr Gruener has spent many hours crouching in scrubland or pouncing in watering holes alongside Sirga . Success? A proud Sirga managed to catch a large swollen toad, and carried it in her mouth . The zoo's pair of endangered Asiatic lions had twin cubs, called Kamran and Ketan, in November 2012. But the mother rejected them when they were just 13 days old after her mate died. 'We don't carry out hand-rearing unless there's a strong reason,' emphasises John. 'If the babies have been with their mother for a while, it is quite a challenge to get them used to artificial milk and teats, as they are obviously used to suckling naturally.' Lions reared by humans will treat them as part of their pride, he says. Many readers will remember the story of John Rendall, who bought a lion cub in the pet department at Harrods in 1969 with his friend Anthony Bourke, and raised it in his flat above a shop on the fashionable King's Road in London. As one: Mr Gruener is fulfilling a lifelong ambition by living with lions in the wilds of Africa . Family: Mr Gruener observes as a veterinarian cares for his beloved lioness friend . The new documentary has been called an 'extraordinary story that transcends all known borders between man and lion, predator and prey' by its makers . Sustainable living: A team from the Modisa Wildlife Project feed a group of young male lions in an enclosure . When the cub, who they called Christian, outgrew the flat, they arranged, with the help of conservations, to introduce him to the wild in Kenya. When John and Anthony returned to Kenya a year later, Christian recognised them instantly, putting his paws on their shoulders in rapturous excitement. The footage subsequently became an internet sensation when it was posted on YouTube in 2008. It has since been watched more than 100 million times. Perhaps the extraordinary bond between Sirga and her surrogate parents Valentin and Mikkel will prove as touchingly enduring.","Video of lion hugging her conservationist carer went viral last year .

"An ancient stone with mysterious Hebrew writing and featuring the archangel Gabriel is going on display in Jerusalem amid an ongoing row over whether it predicts a messiah before Jesus. The so-called Gabriel Stone, said to have been found 13 years ago in Jordan, features an unknown prophetic text from the time of the Second Jewish Temple. The tablet made a splash in 2008 when an Israeli scholar theorized the inscription would revolutionize the understanding of early Christianity, claiming it referenced a messianic resurrection pre-dating Jesus. A museum worker points at the 'Gabriel Stone' , an ancient stone with mysterious Hebrew writing and featuring the archangel Gabriel is being displayed in Israel, even as scholars continue to argue about what the inscription means . The Gabriel Stone made a splash in . 2008 when Israeli Bible scholar Israel Knohl offered a daring theory . that the stone's faded writing would revolutionize the understanding of . early Christianity, claiming it included a concept of messianic . resurrection that predated Jesus. He based his theory on one hazy line, translating it as 'in three days you shall live.' His interpretation caused a storm in . the world of Bible studies, with scholars convening at an international . conference the following year to debate readings of the text, and a . National Geographic documentary crew featuring his theory. An American team of experts using . high resolution scanning technologies tried - but failed - to detect . more of the faded writing. Knohl, a professor of Bible at Hebrew . University in Jerusalem, eventually scaled back from his original . bombshell theory but the fierce scholarly debate he sparked continued to . reverberate across the academic world, bringing international attention . to the stone. Scholars say it as a portal into the religious ideas circulating in the Holy Land in the era when was Jesus was born. Its form is also unique - it is ink written on stone, not carved - and no other such religious text has been found in the region. Curators at the Israel Museum, where the first exhibit dedicated to the stone opened today, say it is the most important document found in the area since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. 'The Gabriel Stone is in a way a Dead Sea Scroll written on stone,' said James Snyder, director of the Israel Museum. The writing dates to the same period, and uses the same tidy calligraphic Hebrew script, as some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, a collection of documents that include the earliest known surviving manuscripts of Hebrew Bible texts.

A museum worker looks at the 'Gabriel Stone' as it is displayed at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem . Over the last few years it went on display alongside other Bible-era antiquities in Rome, Houston and Dallas. Bible experts are still debating the writing's meaning, largely because much of the ink has eroded in crucial spots in the passage and the tablet has two diagonal cracks the slice the text into three pieces. Museum curators say only 40 percent of the 87 lines are legible, many of those only barely. The interpretation of the text featured in the Israel Museum's exhibit is just one of five readings put forth by scholars. All agree that the passage describes an apocalyptic vision of an attack on Jerusalem in which God appears with angels on chariots to save the city. The central angelic character is Gabriel, the first angel to appear in the Hebrew Bible. 'I am Gabriel,' the writing declares. The stone inscription is one of the oldest passages featuring the archangel, and represents an 'explosion of angels in Second Temple Judaism,' at a time of great spiritual angst for Jews in Jerusalem looking for divine connection, said Adolfo Roitman, a curator of the exhibit. The stone inscription is one of the oldest passages featuring the archangel, and represents an 'explosion of angels in Second Temple Judaism,' at a time of great spiritual angst for Jews in Jerusalem looking for divine connection, said Adolfo Roitman, a curator of the exhibit . A Bedouin man is said to have found it in Jordan on the eastern banks of the Dead Sea around the year 2000, Knohl said. An Israeli university professor later examined a piece of earth stuck to the stone and found a composition of minerals only found in that region of the Dead Sea. The stone eventually made it into the hands of Ghassan Rihani, a Jordanian antiquities dealer based in Jordan and London, who in turn sold the stone to Swiss-Israeli collector David Jeselsohn in Zurich for an unspecified amount. Rihani has since died. The Bible scholar traveled to Jordan multiple times to look for more potential stones, but was unable to find the stone's original location. A 3rd century Archangel Gabriel Icon in the Monastery of Saint Catherine, Sinai, Egypt . The exhibit traces the development . of the archangel Gabriel in the three monotheistic religions, displaying . a Dead Sea Scroll fragment which mentions the angel's name; the 13th . century Damascus Codex, one of the oldest illustrated manuscripts of the . complete Hebrew Bible; a 10th century New Testament manuscript from . Brittany, in which Gabriel predicts the birth of John the Baptist and . appears to the Virgin Mary; and an Iranian Quran manuscript dated to the . 15th or 16th century, in which the angel, called Jibril in Arabic, . reveals the word of God to the prophet Mohammad. 'Gabriel . is not archaeology, he is still relevant for millions of people on . earth who believe that angels are heavenly beings on earth,' said . Roitman. The Gabriel Stone, he said, is 'the starting point of an ongoing tradition that still is relevant today.' Israel Museum curators said Jeselsohn lent the stone to the museum for temporary display. Lenny Wolfe, an antiquities dealer in Jerusalem, said that before the Jordanian dealer bought it, another middleman faxed him an image of the stone and offered it for sale. 'The fax didn't come out clearly. I had no idea what it was,' said Wolfe, who passed on the offer. 'It was one of my biggest misses,' Wolfe said. What function the stone had, where it was displayed, and why it was written are unknown, said curators of the Israel Museum exhibit. 'There is still so much that is unclear,' said Michal Dayagi-Mendels, a curator of the exhibit. Scholars, she said, 'will still argue about this for years.'","Ancient stone with mysterious Hebrew writing and featuring the archangel Gabriel .

A family friend also read a statement from Aguilar's father during the hearing. Police say Aguilar was last seen on September 20 at a Gainesville Best Buy store with Bravo. Police believe they may have been fighting over a girl. Aguilar’s backpack was found stashed inside a closet at Bravo's home and his car tested positive for blood. Meanwhile Governor Rick Scott joined the massive search for the victim which also involved helicopters and K-9s. Scott helped search for the missing University of Florida student a day after authorities charged the victim's friend with murder. Support: Gainesville Police spokesman Ben Tobias appealed for the public's help in finding Christian Aguilar . The massive search for Aguilar on Saturday, combed through wooded fields and parking lots. Authorities indicated Aguilar may have been buried near a lime rock roadway. Meanwhile, volunteers at Sweetwater City Hall are collecting water, machetes and rubber boots to help with the search. Police encouraged Florida citizens who have lime roads near their property to search them and look to see if the ground looks to be disturbed. Bravo purchased duct tape and shovel 'several days' before Aguilar went missing, Gainesville police said during an earlier briefing, adding that investigators have not yet recovered the items. Police also said Bravo gave conflicting stories about a fight the two had and was no longer speaking to investigators. 'It is his right, but we believe he is the only person who knows the whereabouts of Christian,' said Gainesville Police spokesman Ben Tobias. 'It's frustrating because he knows where he is.' Police planned to continue their search for the missing student 'until we run out of fresh information'.

"Overwork: Nadezhda Tolokonnikova has suffered from headaches since last spring . A jailed member of the Pussy Riot feminist punk band has been rushed to hospital suffering from overwork at a prison colony known for its harsh conditions, her lawyer claimed. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova has suffered from headaches since last spring and her condition has worsened since October when she was jailed for performing an anti-Putin 'punk prayer' on the altar of Moscow's main cathedral. Like most female prisoners in Russia's . prison colonies, Tolokonnikova spends her days bent over a sewing machine stitching a minimum of 320 jacket linings a day. Her lawyer Irina Khrunova sent a request to prison authorities in December to admit Tolokonnikova in order to perform a detailed medical check, and she was hospitalised on Jan. 24, the lawyer said. Yekaterina Samutsevich, a band member . who also was sentenced to two years in August but later released on . appeal, added that Tolokonnikova feels exhausted after working long . hours with little sleep.

"Hospital consultant Professor Patrick Pullicino warned financial incentives for hospitals to put patients on the Liverpool Care Pathway could influence the work of doctors . Hospitals are paid millions to hit targets for the number of patients who die on the Liverpool Care Pathway, the Mail can reveal. The incentives have been paid to hospitals that ensure a set percentage of patients who die on their wards have been put on the controversial regime. In some cases, hospitals have been set targets that between a third and two thirds of all the deaths should be on the LCP, which critics say is a way of hastening the deaths of terminally ill patients. At least £30million in extra money . from taxpayers is estimated to have been handed to hospitals over the . past three years to achieve these goals. Critics of the method warned . last night that financial incentives for hospitals could influence the . work of doctors. The LCP involves withdrawal of . life-saving treatment. Patients are sedated and most are denied . nutrition and fluids by tube. On average a patient put on the Pathway . dies within 29 hours. One of the leading critics, hospital . consultant Professor Patrick Pullicino, said: 'Given the fact that the . diagnosis of impending death is such a subjective one, putting a . financial incentive into the mix is really not a good idea and it could . sway the decision-making process.' LCP is thought to be used in more than 100,000 cases a year. Yesterday the Association for . Palliative Medicine, which represents doctors working in hospices and on . specialist hospital wards, announced it is organising an inquiry into . the method. The LCP is intended to ease the final . hours of patients who are close to death and to spare them the suffering . associated with invasive treatment. Payments to hospitals to introduce it . are made through a system called Commissioning for Quality and . Innovation, or CQUIN, which channels money to hospital trusts through . NHS 'commissioners'. The use of CQUIN payments to encourage . the spread of the LCP through the wards and to persuade doctors to meet . Pathway targets was revealed in answers to Freedom of Information . requests. Among trusts that confirmed the use . of targets was Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which . said that in the financial year which ended in March the percentage of . patients who died on the Pathway was '43 per cent against a target of 35 . per cent'. Over the year the Trust received . £308,000 for achieving 'goals involving the Liverpool Care Pathway'. Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust had CQUIN payments connected to the . Liverpool Care Pathway almost halved after failing to reach targets. (File picture) Controversial: The LCP is intended to ease the final hours of patients who are close to death and to spare them the suffering associated with invasive treatment . Figures show Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust had CQUIN payments connected to the Liverpool Care Pathway almost halved after failing to reach targets . The Trust was offered £73,385 for increasing numbers of patients who die at home rather than in hospital. Part of the scheme was a target for the number of patients discharged from hospital to die at home after being put on the Liverpool Care Pathway. This would have paid £36,392 if a 47.6 per cent target had been reached. Its FOI statement said: 'The Trust achieved 45.5 per cent so funding for the LCP element was reduced to £18,600.' 'Given the fact that the . diagnosis of impending death is such a subjective one, putting a . financial incentive into the mix is really not a good idea and it could . sway the decision-making process.' Professor Patrick Pullicino . FOI replies so far received by the Mail suggest that if the money paid by NHS commissioners were spread equally around all NHS acute hospitals, it would mean £30million has been sunk into the campaign to put the Pathway into universal use since 2009. The Department of Health defended LCP payments by target last night. A spokesman said: 'It is right local areas try to improve the care and support offered to dying people as it means patients are more comfortable and treated with dignity in their final days and hours. 'We are clear the Liverpool Care Pathway can only work if each patient is fully consulted, where this is feasible, and their family involved in all aspects of decision-making. Staff must properly communicate with the patient and their family – any failure to do so is unacceptable.' But Dr Tony Cole, chairman of the Medical Ethics Alliance pressure group said: 'If death is accelerated by a single day that will save the NHS nearly £200 – that is the estimated cost of a patient per day in hospital. 'My position on the LCP is that it is inherently dangerous and unnecessary.'","Some hospitals set target of two thirds of all deaths should be on LCP .

"The Environmental Protection Agency's top climate change expert and highest paid employee was sentenced to 32 months in federal prison today for defrauding the government. John C. Beale, who lives with his wife in Virginia, claimed he was a CIA agent working in Pakistan so he didn't have to show up for work for months at a time and defrauded the government out of more than $900,000. He said he did it out of 'greed' and got a 'rush of excitement' from it. The 65-year-old's 13 year scam was 'inexplicable' and 'unbelievably egregious', Judge Ellen Huvelle said in Washington D.C. federal court today. Fraud: John C. Beale (pictured on December 16 in court) admitted to defrauding the government out of $900,000 by not showing up to work . Beale has also agreed to pay $1.3 million in restitution and forfeiture to the government, NBC News reported. The . climate change expert, who reported directly to EPA Administrator Gina . McCarthy, said he was ashamed of his CIA scam, which he ran from 2000 . until earlier this year, according to court documents. Beale told the court today: 'Why did I do this? Greed - simple greed - and I'm ashamed of that greed.' He . also admitted that he got a 'sense of excitement' by telling coworkers . that he was a CIA agent - saying 'it was something like an addiction.' The . fraudster plead guilty in September for the scam that saw him take . almost $1 million in salary and benefits from the government over a . decade. No one at the agency questioned or looked into his claims that he was working undercover for the CIA, it was reported. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy was Beale's boss during most of the 13 years he allegedly committed fraud . He . would leave the office for weeks or months - claiming he was at CIA . headquarters in Langley, Virginia, or in Pakistan working on covert . missions.  Beale has never even been to Langley. Really, . he was home reading, riding his bicycle or doing housework. Sometimes . he escaped to his vacation home on Cape Cod, prosecutors said. He . billed taxpayers for 33 plane flights between 2003 and 2011, including . personal trips to London and California, which he flew first class. He . stayed in five-star hotels and billed the government for expensive meals . and limo rides. The total cost: more than $266,000. He . also publicly 'retired,' but managed to continue drawing his $206,000 . salary for 18 months - despite brazenly throwing a retirement party for . himself that was attended by McCarthy. He even lied and said he had contracted malaria while serving in the Vietnam War in order to get a handicapped parking spot. He neither had malaria nor served in Vietnam, according to prosecutors. EPA Assistant Inspector General Patrick Sullivan told NBC that Beale perpetrated a 'crime of massive proportions.' He has been labeled a 'poster child for what is wrong with the government.' His sentence got a quick reaction from Capitol Hill and a top republican has demanded further investigation into the EPA to find out how Beale got away with his scam for so long. 'This case this morning highlights a massive problem with the EPA', Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana told NBC. Beale's direct boss, Gina McCarthy, was criticized for not noticing the scam going on right under her nose, but Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, who is chair of the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, defended McCarthy. 'I commend the EPA administrator (McCarthy) for taking steps to shine a light on the actions of this rogue employee, and her actions helped uncover these crimes', she said. Sullivan, who investigated Beale, said he believes the culture of the EPA made it ripe for this sort of fraud. Beale seen in court on December 16 as the trial for his fraud case was ongoing . 'There’s a certain culture here at the EPA where the mission is the most important thing,' he told NBC. 'They don’t think like criminal investigators. They tend to be very trusting and accepting.' Beale's lawyer had asked for leniency after a psychological review showed he had a 'highly self-destructive and dysfunctional need to engage in excessively reckless, risky behavior.' Beale is a Princeton-educated 'senior policy adviser' who worked as one of the EPA's top climate change experts. He . helped rewrite the Clean Air Act in 1990, led EPA delegations at . climate change conferences in 2000 and 2001, and helped negotiate carbon . emissions agreements with India and China. Sometime along his career, his work stopped being enough. He was caught only after McCarthy, who was appointed EPA administrator in July, discovered that he was still on the payroll in March 2012 - nearly six months after his retirement party. She called for an investigation, which led to the criminal charges. Beale didn't actually retire until this April. Beale is married to Nancy Kete, who President Barack Obama appointed the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. She is currently managing director of the Rockafeller Foundation. The couple own a $872,000 townhouse in Arlington, Virginia, and a $626,000 vacation home on Cape Cod.","John C.

"Government officials have vehemently denied claims that Hillary Clinton is undergoing extensive tests for brain cancer. The National Enquirer reported the debilitating illness was behind the Secretary of State's recent collapse and that she was facing a barrage of medical tests to confirm the diagnosis. But a spokesman for the 65-year-old Democrat labelled the claims 'absolute nonsense' and insisted Clinton was recovering well from the fall and subsequent concussion. Denial: The State Department has vehemently denied claims that Hillary Clinton, pictured in November, is undergoing extensive tests for brain cancer, as reported by the National Enquirer . 'The story... is absolute nonsense. The Secretary continues to recuperate at home,' the spokesman told MailOnline. The Secretary of State suffered a concussion after she collapsed in her home earlier this month. Splash: The National Enquirer splashed the story across its front page, pictured . The State Department said the fall was caused by a debilitating stomach virus Clinton contracted during a diplomatic trip to Europe. But the Enquirer claims in its 'World Exclusive Cover Story' that brain cancer was the real reason behind the collapse, and also behind Clinton's decision to step down as Secretary of State. 'Behind the scenes, Hillary has suffered blinding headaches, problems with her memory, plus terrifying blackouts - and those closest to her say she's hiding a brain cancer secret,' the Enquirer quotes an unnamed source as saying. 'This has been covered up for months, . but details of Hillary's cancer situation are beginning to leak out, . and it's the real reason she's giving up her position as secretary of . state.' The . newspaper said a family insider confirmed Clinton was going through a . series of 'top secret' tests that would diagnose brain cancer. 'While . government officials are blaming her problems on a stomach virus, . they're covering up the real story,' the insider was quoted as saying. 'Everyone's worst nightmare is that she has a brain tumor or, worse yet, incurable brain cancer.' Fall: The Secretary of State, pictured left with President Obama, continues to recover at home after she collapsed earlier this month due to a stomach virus . Successor: President Obama, left, nominated Democratic Senator from Massachusetts John Kerry, right, to replace Clinton . On Friday, President Barack Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to replace Clinton as Secretary of State, after she chose to step down from the high pressure position. The departure was not a surprise. For the past year, she has made her . intentions to leave the position if Obama won a second term clear and . has been saying goodbye to her colleagues in outposts around the world. Healthy: Clinton denied she was running for US president in 2016 and insisted she was healthy during an interview with Barbara Walters, pictured . 'It's important for me to step off this incredibly high wire I've been on to take stock of the rest of my life,' she explained after casting her ballot in November's election. Some still believe Clinton will run for president in 2016 but she recently told ABC's Barbara Walters she was looking forward to her life after politics. 'Maybe (I'll) do some reading and writing and speaking and teaching,' she said. Clinton also assured Walters during the interview that she was 'healthy.'","The National Enquirer claims brain cancer is behind Clinton's recent collapse and that she is facing a barrage of medical tests .

He is unsure of the exact location but is hoping the sighting will soon be verified. Seberger told CNN: ‘At first, I skipped past . it, thinking, 'Nah. No way I would find anything that  quickly, but . then I kept scrolling back to it and thinking to myself, It does . resemble a plane.’ The Malaysia Airlines flight went missing on Saturday on its way to China - there were 239 people on board. About an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the Boeing 777 flew over the south of Vietnam before vanishing from radars. The last communication the Malaysian authorities received was as the plane crossed the boundary between Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace. Air traffic control in Malaysia said it was handing the jet over to controllers in Ho Chi Minh city before contact was completely lost.

"A well earned holiday seems to have done the Queen a world of good. The Queen was seen at Kings Lynn station this morning looking refreshed in a tailored mauve coat. The monarch, who has not been conducting official duties since the traditional Christmas day church service attended by the Royal family, was spotted boarding a train back to London after her Christmas break at the Royal residence in Sandringham, Norfolk. The Queen was seen at Kings Lynn station this morning looking refreshed in a tailored mauve coat . The Queen looked well rested as she was led down the platform to board the train back to London . True to form, the great-grandmother wore a sensible pair of low- heeled black court shoes and accessorised her chic outfit with several strings of pearls and a gold flower broach with a purple stone set in its centre . The 87-year-old braved the chilly weather and fierce winds on the platform in a snug-looking button down coat with matching silk trim which fell below her knees, which she wore over a dress of the same shade. Appearing to be returning to the capital without Prince Phillip, her Majesty wore a pair of plain black gloves to protect her hands from the cold, and seemed to be clutching one of her signature head scarves in her left hand as she was guided along the platform by security staff and network rail personnel. True to form, the great-grandmother wore a sensible pair of low-heeled black court shoes and accessorised her chic outfit with several strings of pearls and a gold flower brooch with a purple stone set in its centre.

"From Kim Kardashian's vampire facials - which draws her own blood before injecting it back into her face - to Simon Cowell's beloved sheep placenta facials, there's some weird and wonderful beauty treatments on the market today. But one grandmother's bizarre beauty secret has just gone and trumped them all. 67-year-old Stella Ralfini from London says that her key to eternal youth is semen facials. Bizarre: Speaking in a YouTube video, 67-year-old Stella Ralfini says that her key to eternal youth is semen facials - a tip she picked up on her travels in India . 'It's worth thousands and thousands, but it's free,' she explains in a YouTube video. 'All you need is a lover but if you don't have one, you know what to do. All you need to do is, every ten days or two weeks, just both have a good time, make sure he has a good time, and when your beautiful love-making session is over, you are going to scoop this amazing sperm mask up in your fingers, put it on your face, leave it for fifteen minutes and wash it off.' She goes on: ''I know some of you are thinking ""What is she saying?!"" but we have to assume that your lover is a healthy clean man and eats wells. British Stella, who describes herself as an author, life coach, couples counselor and tantric guide, explains that she learned the bizarre anti-ageing trick during her time in India, where she was studying a lovemaking method called Tantra. Skincare secret: She advises people to 'scoop this amazing sperm mask up in your fingers, put it on your face, leave it for fifteen minutes and wash it off' Does it work? Stella said a lady in India swore by the technique, which had been passed down her family . Too far? Stella, an author and sex coach, describes a lover's semen as 'the freshest cell therapy available on our planet' Writing on her website, she said: 'I came across one of the most beautiful women I'd ever seen. She told me she was in her late sixties but looked much younger. Her skin was so silky smooth and line free, I had to know her secret. 'Her secret was that she used a face mask made from her husband's sperm (apparently this beauty tip had been passed down through generations of her family and always been thought of as nothing.' Stella describes a lover's semen as 'the freshest cell therapy available on our planet' because, she claims, it is packed with recognised proteins and minerals that are known to reduce the ageing process. Does she swear by it too? In an on-camera interview with TMZ, actress Heather Locklear, 51, said she uses semen on her skin . And Stella isn't the only fan of the quirky beauty trick. In an on-camera interview with TMZ, actress Heather Locklear, 51, was asked if she had any recommendations for anti-ageing skincare products. 'You just put semen on your face,' she replied. According to NY magazine, human sperm is a powerful anti-oxidant that is said to diminish wrinkles and smooth the skin. The substance is now even sold by a Norwegian company called Bioforskning and spermine facials are offered in New York. Cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Oscar Hevia told HollywoodLife.com that there's some truth in this bizarre beauty tip. 'Semen contains proteolytic enzymes, which are designed to break down proteins. In theory, if applied to the skin, these enzymes could help to break down the uneven and thickened dead layer of older, sun-damaged skin. This could make the skin feel smoother. 'However, this might only be achieved with daily application for days or weeks. It would also not be practical as a “mask,” since it is a body fluid and will not remain stable outside the body. It would lose its beneficial effect, if any, very quickly after application.'","Stella Ralfini says that her key to eternal youth is semen facials .

"Three teenagers frantically used their cellphones to call their father for help from a sinking van after their troubled mother drove them into a river. Joann Smith, from Florence Township, New Jersey, drove onto a boat ramp and accelerated into the Delaware River on Tuesday night, according to the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office. The mother, who has battled mental illness for more than a decade, was inside the vehicle with her two sons and a daughter, aged 13, 14 and 15, when she plunged into the water. They were pulled to safety by a passerby, but before help arrived, the teens used their cellphones to call for help, their father said. Scroll down for video . Good Samaritan: Darnell Taylor pulled Joann Smith and her three teenage children from her submerged car after she drove it into the Delaware River. No one was seriously hurt and Smith has been arrested . 'They did all the right things,' said the father, Jeffrey Smith. 'I just thank God that they got out safely.' Jeffrey . Smith said he received a call from his daughter around 6:30 p.m. on . Tuesday. He said his two sons in the van were simultaneously trying to . call 911, but one was cut off when the phone got wet. Smith said he was about 15 miles away running an errand with the couple's eldest son when he got the call. But luckily . 36-year-old Darnell Taylor and his wife were driving past - and the car . caught his eye. He told his wife they should turn back in case anyone . needed his help. 'I got out of the car and heard people screaming,' Taylor told NBC 10. 'I took off my jacket, jumped in and swam out there.' As he swam towards the family, his wife called 911. 'I . couldn't get the window open because the window in the van was not a . pop out window,' Taylor said. 'So I kept telling the young lady to kick . the window out and she kicked it out.' Taylor grabbed the mother and her children one-by-one and returned them to the shore, taking eight trips in total. Smith said nothing to him throughout the rescue except 'thank you', he said. One of the children suffered a cut to the leg, but no other injuries were disclosed. Scene: Witnesses say she had bought her children ice cream before driving them off this ramp into the river . Nearby residents branded him a hero, but Taylor insisted that he was not. 'I'm just a member of this community and anyone else would have done the same thing,' he said. Smith is known by residents in the area and moments before she drove into the river, she bought her . two sons and her daughter ice cream at the shop across the street. Jeffrey Smith said Thursday that his wife has been battling mental illness for more than a decade. Treatments have included hospitalizations and medications, he said, yet it's hard to determine 'when things are going to go bad'. He said he never anticipated a situation like this. The children are now staying with relatives, according to the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office. Smith was charged with three counts each of attempted murder and endangering the welfare of a child. She is being evaluated in a medical facility, and her bail was set at $600,000. She is expected to appear in state Superior Court in Mount Holly on Thursday afternoon.

"A new multi-million-pound job search website launched by the Government has been inundated with bogus adverts recruiting for everything from mafia 'couriers' to 'porn chat' hosts. Since going live last month, the site has even carried adverts for MI6 assassins. A number of jobs have had to be taken down from the Universal Jobmatch website and scores of employee accounts blocked since it was launched. Questionable listings spotted on the site include an advert seeking three  'international . couriers' for CosaNostra Holdings, and a 'target elimination specialist' for MI6. 'Target elimination specialist': An advert for a James Bond-style MI6 assassin is among the fake listings posted on the Government's new job website . The ad for CosaNostra - the name of the Sicilian Mafia - said applicants should have 'their own transport' and be able to travel to a 'production hub in Amsterdam to collect high value packages and bring them back to the UK'. It was later removed. Another listing claimed to be seeking a James Bond-style 'target elimination specialist' for the British intelligence service MI6 - which also appeared on on the Department for Work and Pensions' Jobcentre website - which Universal Jobmatch has replaced. The spoof recruitment ad appeared on . the DirectGov site and stated that the successful applicant should be . trained in using sniper rifles, be able to leave foreign countries by . non-conventional means and assume new identities. It added that candidates for the MI6 . post should be willing to 'remove people' on behalf of the Government . and would be equipped with special watches, jet packs and . mini-submarines.

There are also fears jobseekers could fall victim to identity theft, after a group of hackers deliberately highlighted potential security risks on the site. They told a Channel Four news report they had been able to obtain scores of jobseekers' passport and national insurance details. Department of Work and Pensions minister Iain Duncan Smith said 6,000 adverts had been blocked from appearing on the website since its launch. An MI6 spokesman said at the time of the first fake advert: 'It is disappointing that somebody would want to post a fake advert when people are looking for real jobs. It has now been removed.'

"WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Casually propped against a wall, the two rocket launchers and hunting rifle below are just some of a cache of guns inside the home of 'weapons mad' Belgian killer Nordine Amrani. The arsenal was uncovered by police during a raid of the gunman's home during October 2007 and also includes several other powerful rifles, ammunition, and what appears to be a flak jacket. Amrani, who on Tuesday murdered four people and wounded 125 others, also used his home in the city of Liege as a cannabis factory, with police finding more than 2,800 plants during the raid. Scroll down for video... Pictured is a room in Amrani's flat raided by police in October 2007 showing various weapons and military style clothing . Firearms: Pictured are just part of the weapons cache police found at Amrani's flat in October 2007 . Plantation: Police found a cannabis den containing 2,800 plants in a shed owned by Amrani in 2007 . Amrani had rigged up special lighting and was growing more than 2,000 plants in a shed discovered by police . Yesterday, Amrani's lawyer said he carried out the attack because he feared being sent to back to prison for a sex crime. Killer: Nordine Amrani murdered a cleaning lady in his rented flat before heading off on a bloodthirsty rampage in the centre of the Belgian city . The . 32-year-old convicted criminal, who was due to marry his long-term . girlfriend, used grenades and a semi-automatic rifle to cause carnage in . the Belgian city before turning a revolver on himself. Among . his victims was a 45-year-old cleaning lady whom he shot dead near his . home on Tuesday morning, as well as a 17-month old baby boy. Defence . lawyer Jean-Francois Dister said Amrani, a Belgian from a Moroccan . background, was on parole and was due to answer a summons about . allegedly ‘sexually molesting’  a young woman. He is thought to have attacked the unnamed victim after driving alongside her in his van. Its number plate was captured by CCTV. One of Amrani’s numerous previous convictions was for rape, for which he had been given a two-year suspended sentence in 2003. If convicted again for a sex crime, he would have had to serve it. This would have also meant his girlfriend, a nurse called Perrin Balon, finding out about the sex allegations against him. ‘He feared being returned to prison,’said Mr Dister. ‘He called me twice on Monday afternoon and on Tuesday morning about it. ‘What worried him most was to be jailed again. According to my client it was a set-up by people who wanted to harm him. Mr Amrani had a grudge against the law. 'He thought he had been wrongfully convicted.’ After . Tuesday’s attack, the bag Amrani used to carry his haul of weapons was . found to still contain several loaded magazines, as well as a number of . live grenades. An enquiry has been launched into why he had not been under closer . supervision while on bail after early release from a sentence of nearly . five years. His weapons were confiscated because of his other criminal offences, yet . he managed to obtain a FAL Belgian assault rifle, grenades and other . weapons soon after his release in October 2010. Belgian’s . notoriously liberal criminal justice system is already facing questions . as to why, in October 2010, the killer had been released from prison . three years early after being convicted of firearms and drug offences.

On Tuesday morning, Amrani is thought . to have tried to rape the woman cleaner in his flat, where police had . found an arsenal of weapons including a rocket launcher, AK47 and . Kalashnikov. Police said he . killed her 'with a bullet to her head' and then dumped her body in a . lock-up shed where he was growing cannabis plants. He then left money for Ms Balon, with a note that said: 'Good luck! I love you.' A police source said: 'The cleaner had been working in a neighbour's home. It appears that Amrani had invited her into his own flat to discuss the possibility of cleaning his flat. 'There were signs of a struggle, and it may be that Amrani had tried to rape her. 'Whatever happened, she was undoubtedly his first murder victim on Tuesday morning.' Cedric Visart Bocarme, the Belgian . Attorney General, confirmed that the woman 'would have been murdered by . the killer just before he went to Place Saint-Lambert'. The . attack brought horror to Belgium's fifth largest city, with crowds of . shoppers, many of them children, screaming and running in panic as . grenades exploded and shots rang out. Mourning: A woman places a cuddly toy in a broken bus shelter in the Place Saint-Lambert in Liege . Grief: Five people, including the gunman himself, died in the incident which is being mourned by Belgians . Tributes: People were yesterday morning seen leaving flowers at the scene of the deadly grenade attack in Liege . Clean up: Workers yesterday started to clean up the debris from the rampage . Injured: Cynthia Cannella was wounded in the attack . Today, a small crowd gathered at the Place Saint-Lambert for a minute's silence at 12noon, 24 hours after the shooting. Students at the Saint Barthelemy High School - attended by two of the victims - also joined hands and observed the silence. Abdelhadi Amrani, another lawyer who worked for the killer but is not related, said he had grown up in foster homes after being orphaned as a child. ‘I remember a man deeply marked by the loss of his parents,’ said Ms Amrani. ‘He lost his father and mother very early. He was marked by fate. ‘I would add he was a very smart boy, gifted. 'Nordine often spoke of his desire to start a family. He was to be married to a nurse in Liege.’ Commenting on Amrani’s background, Ms Amrani said: ‘He did not feel at all Moroccan. He did not speak a word of Arabic, and was not Muslim. What he said is that he felt like a Belgian. ‘He was crazy about weapons, but as a . collector. 'He felt he had not had much luck in life and felt unfairly . treated by the courts. 'This was the fed-up cry of a tormented soul – he was estranged from justice, and against society.’ A 17-month-old baby boy called Gabriel . became the fourth victim after dying in hospital late on Tuesday night . despite undergoing hours of emergency treatment. Gabriel was in the arms of his mother . when he was hit by a bullet in the back of the head. The child and his . parents were at the bus stop just below the walkway from where Amrani . opened fire. Amrani had been due to attend a police interview in the late morning but never showed up. Instead . he left his apartment armed with a Belgian-made FN- FAL automatic . rifle, a handgun and up to a dozen grenades carried in a backpack. He . drove the five-minute journey from his 1930s apartment building the . Residence Belvedere and parked his white van in Place St Lambert. He walked on to a raised walkway above a bus stop where lunchtime shoppers were thronging for the opening of a Christmas market. From . his 15ft high vantage point he lobbed three hand grenades towards a . busy bus shelter before opening fire on the crowd. A 15-year-old boy . died instantly while the baby of 17 months and a 17-year-old boy . succumbed to their injuries in hospital. Five . people are still fighting for their lives, including a 75-year old . woman who was initially declared dead on arrival at hospital. Stopped in his tracks: A body, thought to be gunman Nordine Amrani, lies on the pavement close to a gun and full clips of ammunition.

"Clasping a stranger's hand in the basement of a derelict old mansion, the lights fizzle, go out — the room is plunged into darkness. I am on the Alton Towers Ultimate Sleepover, a brand new experience for this year's Scarefest Halloween extravaganza, which promises to petrify punters until 3am every night. As well as the usual Horror Maze and zombie-filled scare zones strewn across the park, brave souls can sign up to the full overnight experience. Towers of terror: Alton Towers is being haunted by a few frankly unpleasant characters for Halloween . Which is how I find myself standing around a bonfire, in the abandoned theme park at 8pm on a cold autumn night (not feeling particularly brave). The evening starts off well enough with a two-course buffet meal around a bonfire in the park's gardens. Do come and join us: A cast of ghastly ghouls and ghostly figures has been assembled for Scarefest . The expert team, led by ghost hunter extraordinaire Nigel and his daughter Sadie, tell tales of spooks who haunt the premises and ghostly goings on in the grounds. Then we are escorted to the house. The first part of the night takes place in the crypts of the mansion, where the team try to summon some spirits. We stand in the darkness, holding hands, instructed not to break the circle - the only sound I can hear is my heart racing. Not so creature comfortable: Guests staying over for Scarefest can look forward to suitably scary lodging . As we move to the basement the story of the haunting of the house unfolds, and strange things start to happen. Sadie cries quietly in the corner, the cup on the table starts to move, and Nigel admits that things have got a bit out of control. There's no rest, either. We are led to a dormitory of camp beds and a night of terror ensues. Until 3am we are haunted, harassed and dragged from our beds by our hosts who have been possessed by the very spirits they were trying to raise (or so it goes). All aglow: The park takes on a different atmosphere after dark, when most of the crowds have gone home . In the morning, somewhat weary, we are woken again for breakfast before being sent off to enjoy a day in the park. Scarefest has a certification - you have to be over 16. And it should add another - not for the faint-hearted. Scarefest at Alton Towers (0871 222 3330, www.altontowers.com) runs until November 2. The Ultimate Sleepover starts from £240 per person, and from £200 per person when booking a group of six people or more. This includes breakfast, two-day theme park entry, one-day Scare Maze ticket, two-course buffet meal and car parking.","The Staffordshire theme park has embraced the ghostly for Halloween .

"One night last November, when we arrived home from school, Mummy and Daddy told us that they had heard strange sounds from the area behind our garage. We put on our wellies and ran excitedly across the grass, past the chickens and the pond, to the back of the garden where Daddy parks his car. Balancing on top of the builders' rubble and our old bikes was a pile of sparkly boxes. He's the genuine article: Scott and Megan met the real Santa Claus at his snowy home at the top of the planet . There was a small one labelled 'Megan', a slightly bigger one labelled 'Scott', a bigger one still labelled 'Mummy', and the biggest one of all labelled 'Daddy'. We tore off the silver ribbon and bows and opened the boxes. Each one contained a jumper with a picture on it. Megan and Daddy had a snowman, Scott had a Father Christmas and Mummy had a sparkly penguin. In ours we also had a rolled up sheet of thick paper, tied with a red bow. Daddy unrolled it and read what it said. Written in swirly hand writing, like we'd seen in old books, it said: . Dear Megan and Scott . I hear from my robins that you have been very good this year. I'd like you to come and meet me at the North Pole. Your mummy and daddy can come too. It's very cold, so I have asked my elves to send you some new jumpers to keep you warm. See you soon! Lots of Love, Santa x . For a moment we didn't quite understand. Then Mummy and Daddy explained. We had been written to by the Real Santa Claus, and he'd posted us the boxes and the letter from his home at the North Pole. We've both seen all the helpers who look like Santa that appear around town at Christmas. But this was the Real Santa, really inviting us to visit him in his real home at the real North Pole. And he'd sent us new jumpers to keep us warm. We couldn't believe how lucky we were. Thank goodness we'd been good! A few weeks later Mummy and Daddy drove us to the airport in Bristol. Santa had sent a special plane to collect us and some other lucky children. We were worried it would take a very long time, but by the time we'd watched a film and done some colouring we were there. When we arrived at the airport at the North Pole we had to collect our suitcases, but before they arrived we spotted two elves with pointy ears who had been hiding under the place where the bags go round. Jumpers required for big adventures: Scott and Megan with mum Kirsty and TV presenter dad Martin Roberts . They were very naughty elves, because they kept tapping people on the back and then running away. It made us laugh a lot. All around the airport it was snowy. There was a man dressed in funny clothes that Mummy said everyone would have worn here years ago. He had a pet reindeer. We gave it a carrot. It looked a bit like Sven from Frozen. In fact, everything looked frozen. We got on a coach that took us to the place we were staying. On the way, some different elves made us sing silly songs. After half an hour Mummy and Daddy said the songs were driving them mad. But we carried on singing. Our hotel was made from wood. The room was really big and had a TV. There was a kitchen where Mummy could cook our tea. The best thing was that the room had a balcony that was covered in snow that came up to our tummies. There were lots of other wooden hotels all around, and a place we went to for our breakfast. There was even a supermarket. We didn't think they would have a supermarket at the North Pole - especially one that sold DVDs. That night we went for a ride on special machines that could go through the snow. They were like the ones from Scott's Star Wars LEGO. Daddy drove one, and we snuggled under a blanket in another with Mummy. We went through the car park and out into the forest. Eventually we arrived at a place where there was a bonfire and a man who gave us hot chocolate with marshmallows in it. The grown-ups said we had come to see the Northern Lights, but someone had switched them off. The next day we got on another coach and went to a secret place in the forest. There were loads of fun things to do, like sledging, rides on a sleigh pulled by real reindeer, and a funny show starring the elves. But then we got into a special sledge that was pulled by an elf on a sort of motorbike for the snow. A bit different to a sleigh ride: A snowmobile ride in search of the Northern Lights was also part of the holiday . We went down a path through the trees to a clearing where there was a little wooden house. Inside the house, sitting beside a roaring fire, was the Real Santa Claus. He looked the same as lots of other Santa Clauses we'd seen, but his tummy was even bigger and his beard even longer and whiter than anyone else's. Somehow he knew our names, and he asked us what we wanted him to bring us on Christmas night. He said we could take a picture and gave us an early Christmas present. On the way home we heard Mummy and Daddy say that it had cost a lot, and that the food 'left a bit to be desired'. We didn't understand what they meant. Santa had invited us to come for free. And as for the food - it was better than eating snow, and the hotel was at the North Pole, so the person cooking would have to find things to cook in the forest. And anyway, on Christmas Day we got exactly what we had asked Santa for, so it was worth it. I hope we get invited again this year, although Santa did say that there were a lot of children in the world that he wanted to invite, so it's OK if we don't as we've already had our turn. And if any silly boys or girls at school say 'there's no such thing as Santa Claus', we will know they are fibbing, because we have met him.

"In my job as a comedienne/impressionist I was lucky enough to land a job on a leg of P&O Cruises' Aurora world cruise - and brought the family along. The segment of the cruise we enjoyed was the five-day leg from Singapore to Sri Lanka. I am glad to say that my on-board guest entertainment act seemed to go down well - though quite what the non-British passengers made of my takes on the likes of Stacey Solomon, Davina McCall and Anne Robinson I'm not too sure. But I, at least, really enjoyed it. And here's me during a quick day off: Debra and their children hit the beach on Malaysia's Langkawi shoreline . The job presented me with the opportunity to bring my husband and our two children, aged 11 and seven, along on a voyage in a very beautiful part of the world. My children were also able to see my act - so that they could finally understand what I do for a living. We liked the fact that the cruise was very British: the voyage's itinerary begins and ends in Southampton, so the majority of passengers were from the UK - and on-board activities were run largely to satisfy British tastes. My initial pleasure at being on a cruise ship was the realisation that I was to be relieved of my usual domestic chores: it was very nice, for example, to take a break from vacuuming! Islands of inspiration: Malaysia's Langkawi archipelago has some of the Far East's loveliest beaches . We stopped twice on our short trip, firstly in Port Klang, which serves Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur. The following day we got to see a little bit of the beautiful archipelago of Langkawi. The day we stopped there was my husband's birthday, so we decided to enjoy it on the beach. What I love about cruising is the fact that you get a taster of these different places. Ever wondered what Malaysia is like? On a cruise you can find out in a few hours. Another surprise for first-time cruisers is that the ship is a selfcontained world of its own, with everything you could possibly want to enjoy the perfect holiday. The food on board, for instance, is a key attraction. Dining in the restaurant was a pleasure, not just because of the cuisine but also because of the staff: the waiters were just lovely. Our kids loved one of them so much they actually said: 'Can we keep in touch with him?' One of the things you often hear is that people put on half a stone during a cruise. Not me: I actually lost 6lb in a week. I know that sounds ridiculous and it sounds as if I didn't like the dishes served, but I really did. I found that there was so much choice and I naturally gravitated towards the healthier options. Where, at home, I can be a bit lazy and just grab a calorific sandwich, on board the Aurora I was able to enjoy healthy salads and fruits. A big boat for a brilliant family holiday: Debra sailed on the P&O Cruises liner Aurora . The kids also ate well because, again, there was a lot of choice for them, and because it was all so beautifully presented they were willing to try things they had never eaten before. It helped that they spent most of their days in the pool and were very hungry when meal times came around. We had a few days in Sri Lanka at the end of the tour and joined some great excursions. We really enjoyed our visit to Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage, for example. I would love to go back to Singapore, our 'taster' visit really made us want to return. There was an excursion to the zoo which we didn't get to do, and we would have loved to visit the street markets too. Cruising is like the best showbusiness act - it leaves you wanting more! Like my act, hopefully… . P&O Cruises (www.pocruises.com; 0843 374 0111) offers fly-cruises in South East Asia and the Middle East.

"There was an hour of daylight left in the Omani desert when we hopped into the Land Cruiser. Our guide, Zubair, revved the engine - in another life he might have been a rally driver - and off we set. ‘Dune bashing!’ cried Zubair, encouraged by squawks of delight from our youngest daughter, aged ten. Down and dirty in the dust: Oman is a great place to try the very modern motorised pastime of dune-bashing . Oman’s Wahiba Sands are classic desert terrain - the sort you get in a David Lean film or one of those ‘parched man crawls towards oasis’ newspaper cartoons. Hillocks of sand stretched to the horizon. What was most striking was the colours, at once uniform and subtly different. The sand was all yellow, of course, but there were valleys of brown and black, too, lengthening as the golden sun dropped. Zubair drove with gusto. We surged over and through the dunes. It was like skiing. ‘Snowplough!’ I yelled when we seemed to be going down an incline far too steeply - and the car, thrillingly, was skidding sideways, throwing out a high spray of sand. Where desert meets water: The Omani capital Muscat has a picturesque charm and an undiscovered vibe . Our children cackled with laughter. Zubair grinned broadly. My wife screamed. The moment we stepped out of the 4x4, there came a contrast: complete, refreshing silence as we sat on the dune tops and watched the sun set on this astonishing landscape. This was the reason I’d dug deep into the family savings and chosen Oman for a week’s holiday over New Year. It lived up to every expectation. The Sultanate of Oman, long an ally of Britain, lies east of Saudi Arabia. To its south is troubled Yemen. British Airways flights from Heathrow take seven hours to reach the Omani capital Muscat. For the first four days, we had the company of speed-merchant Zubair. He took us to the fortified town of Nizwa, where a splendidly busy and smelly livestock market is held on Fridays. The nut sellers in the souk had copped on to the idea of overcharging Western tourists — when my wife asked for a small bag of cashews, she was charged the Omani rial equivalent of £3. ‘You should have haggled,’ I said. She told me she would have felt mean. ‘They expect and enjoy haggling,’ insisted Zubair. Nizwa has a restored fort that could have been the setting for Carry On Up The Khyber. I was half expecting to find Kenneth Williams round the next turret. A solid day's work: Fishing is still an important part of life in the waterfront Muttrah district of Muscat . Even better than Nizwa’s fort was the one at Jabrin, where a 17th-century sultan reclined with dates, concubines and political worries. His reception room had hidey holes from which his henchmen could pounce to slay visitors. And his fortifications had gizmos worthy of James Bond: false steps on stairs down where attackers might plunge to their deaths, and ‘killing holes’ through which boiling-hot date syrup could be poured. The beautiful Sun And Moon room, meanwhile, was cleverly designed to keep the ruler cool by day and silver-lit by night. Arid Oman’s mountains are a purpling grey, and water is precious. Where the irrigation projects have not yet reached, you see blue water lorries labouring up roads. Government infrastructure work is everywhere. Since 1970, the country has been wrenched from medieval times into the 21st century, yet its people remain gracious and attractively modest. Although Western tourists are welcomed, women are urged to dress discreetly in the streets (no short skirts, low-cut tops or bare shoulders). Pleased to meet you: Though a different prospect to Dubai, Oman is a place that offers a warm welcome . Nor would you ever go to Oman for a Western stag night - alcohol is not plentiful. We spent a night on the country’s tallest mountain, 9,800ft Jebel Shams, which has a not-so-mini ‘Grand Canyon’. Our accommodation at the View Camp was odd - freezing-cold, prefab huts with mod-con bathrooms worthy of a London hotel. But true to its name, it had a fine view of the plain below. The nearby village of Misfat was a delight, an oasis perched on a hill with banana trees and palms. My wife was so enchanted by one deep-gorge wadi we visited that she has kept drawing pictures of it since we got home. In the desert, we stayed at another camp where the sleeping quarters were Bedouin-style tents, and evening entertainment was provided by a discordant band of bongo drummers and overweight dancing ladies. For supper, the staff produced a side of spiced lamb that had been cooking for 24 hours. Gosh, it was cold that night. But our children found it all fascinating - and they even got to grips with a few hesitant words of Arabic. Meeting the local wildlife: It is almost impossible to travel through Oman without spotting a camel or two . The least interesting part of the trip was when we returned towards Muscat and had a few nights at the opulent (but pricey) Al Waha Hotel. Great pools, comfortable rooms, but we could have been in Western Europe, complete with a clientele of bored white bankers and their pouting girlfriends. We did manage to escape into the city, however, and visit the souk, with its goodly whiff of frankincense, the fish market (rather different smells there) and the Grand Mosque, which was completed in 2001. The chandelier in the mosque’s main chamber has more than 1,000 bulbs - just think of the electricity bills! The mosque complex, which can accommodate 20,000 worshippers, is a monument to cultural and national self-confidence in a country blessed with rich natural resources and a lingering Arabian mystique. Abercrombie & Kent (01242 854 133, www.abercrombiekent.co.uk) offers eight nights in Oman from £1,675 per adult, based on two sharing. Children under 12 are an additional £1,025 pp based on two sharing, including return flights with British Airways.","Dubai's next-door neighbour has plenty to offer as a holiday destination .

"Three witnesses spotted 9/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta casing security at Boston's Logan International Airport and reported his suspicious behavior to authorities - but airport security ignored the warnings and never questioned him, a shocking new report reveals . The witnesses have been identified for the first time by the New York Post after testifying in a lawsuit on behalf of the the families of the victims who died aboard American Airlines Flight 11 on September 11, 2001. Atta, a ringleader of the 9/11 attacks, was spotted filming the TSA security checkpoints at Logan on May 11, 2001. One of the witnesses, a veteran American Airlines technician, even confronted the al-Qaeda member and asked him what he was doing. Scroll down for video . Security lapse: Terrorist ringleader Mohamed Atta smuggled boxcutters and pepper spray through security at the airport in Portland, Maine, (pictured) then flew to Boston, where he hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 . Ringleader: Mohamed Atta was spotted casing the Boston airport in May 2011 . Surveillance video had not even been installed at the airport yet, so no video record exists of Atta's activities. Atta, who was a trained commercial pilot, and four other terrorists smuggled box cutters and pepper spray through the security at the airport in Portland, Maine,  on the morning of September 11 and flew to Boston. They then boarded American Airlines Flight 11 and overpowered the pilots and crashed the Boeing 767 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center - the first attack against the Twin Towers. All 92 people aboard the plane were killed and hundreds of people at the Trade Center died in the crash and subsequent collapse of the building. Stephen J. Wallace revealed in testimony that he saw two Arabs, including one matching Atta's description, conspicuously filming a security checkpoint at Logan about 25 feet away while talking loudly in Arabic, according to the Post. This went on for 45 minutes, Mr Wallace told a court. He said he contacted security, but police never responded. 'I said, specifically, ""These two clowns are up to something. They’ve been taking videos and pictures down at the main checkpoint,""' he testified, according to the Post . Finally, Mr Wallace confronted Atta - who had a set of brand-new pilot luggage. He said he asked the two men whether they had any prohibited items in their bags. They swore at him in Arabic, then boarded an American Airlines flight to Washington Dulles International Airport. Theresa Spagnuolo, an American Airlines passenger screener, and her supervisor James Miller Jr. also noticed the men and reported them to authorities. They were told that police could do nothing about Atta's behavior, they later testified. The Post reports that even pre-9/11 laws could have allowed authorities to stop and question Atta. 'I’m convinced that had action been taken after the sighting of Atta, the 9/11 attacks, at least at Logan, could have been deterred,' Brian Sullivan, a former FAA special agent, told the newspaper. Atta flew Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing all 92 people aboard. Thousands more died in the towers and after the subsequent collapse .","Stephen J Wallace testified in a lawsuit that he watched two Arab men film a security checkpoint at Boston's Logan International Airport for 45 minutes .

"Nearly 800 people have had surgical instruments left inside them after having an invasive procedure at a hospital since 2005, according to a new report. The report from The Joint Commission, a non-profit health care safety watchdog, shows there were 772 incidents of foreign objects left in patients between 2005 and 2012, resulting in 16 deaths. Equipment like sponges, towels, needles, . instruments, retractors and other small items and fragments of tools . have been found in patients. Horror operation: There were 772 incidents of foreign objects left in patients between 2005 and 2012, resulting in 16 deaths . Forgotten: Equipment like sponges, towels, needles, instruments, retractors and other small items and fragments of tools have been found in patients . The researchers found the most common causes of these incidents were due to human error and a lack of policies and procedures. The report notes that doctors traditionally rely on protocols like counting all of their tools or conducting ‘cavity sweeps’ to look for equipment. About 80 per cent of retained sponges occur when the nurses and doctors think they've had a correct count. In 95 per cent of the cases, patients had to stay longer in the hospital, according to CBS News. The most common sites these incidents occurred were operating rooms, labour and delivery rooms, ambulatory surgery centres or labs where invasive procedures such as catheters or colonoscopies take place. Final count: Doctors traditionally rely on protocols like counting all of their tools or conducting 'cavity sweeps' to look for equipment . An incident was nine times more likely when an operation was performed in an emergency basis and four times more likely when the procedure changed unexpectedly. Sophia Savage, a nurse from Kentucky is one of those unlucky people to have experienced this first hand. She became violently ill in 2005, only to undergo a CT scan and find out a surgical sponge had been left in her abdomen during a hysterectomy four years earlier. ‘What they found was horrific,’ Savage told the New York Times in 2012. ‘It had adhered to the bladder and the stomach area, and to the walls of my abdominal cavity.’ She added, ‘I never dreamed something like this would happen to me.’ The Commission says she suffered severe health issues, anxiety, depression and disability. Savage sued the hospital where the surgery took place for $2.5 million, but the award was appealed. Human error: About 80 per cent of retained sponges occur when the nurses and doctors think they've had a correct count . 'Open communication': Ana Pujols-McKee, executive vice president and chief medical officer at The Joint Commission, who did the report. She says it is critical that hospitals comply with procedures . The watchdog is now calling for a stricter, more standardised counting system involving all members of the hospital team, including surgeons, nurses, techs, anesthesiologists, and radiologists. They recommend two people - a nurse and tech - count out all the equipment and have it verified by a surgeon. The counts should be performing them before the surgery begins, before the cavity is closed and at the time the procedure ends. A whiteboard can display the count, and the team should debrief to address any concerns about equipment or the procedure. Such a system was shown to reduce errors at one children's hospital by 50 per cent in only one year. ‘It's . critical to establish and comply with policies and procedures to make . sure all surgical items are identified and accounted for, as well to . ensure that there is open communication by all members of the surgical . team about any concerns,’ said Dr Ana Pujols McKee, chief medical . officer of The Joint Commission in a statement on their website.","772 incidents of foreign objects left in patients between 2005 and 2012 .

"Shocking details have emerged of how a multimillionaire heir to the du Pont chemical business was convicted of raping his three-year-old daughter but escaped serving prison time after a Delaware Superior Court judge ruled he would ‘not fare well’. Robert H. Richards IV was charged with fourth-degree rape in 2009 after he admitted that he had raped his daughter almost a decade ago. News of the shocking leniency shown to Richards, 46, only emerged on Tuesday in the details of a lawsuit filed against him by his ex-wife Tracy. Robert H. Richards IV was charged with fourth-degree rape in 2009 after he admitted that he had raped his daughter almost a decade ago . News of the shocking leniency shown to Richards emerged just last Tuesday in the details of a lawsuit filed against him by his ex-wife Tracy . In her lawsuit, Tracy Richards charges that he penetrated his daughter with his fingers while masturbating, and subsequently also assaulted his toddler son as well. Tracy Richards, who along with the two children now live in a rental home, is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for assault, negligence, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress on his two children. Robert Richards is an unemployed heir living off his trust fund. He is the great grandson of du Pont family patriarch Irenee du Pont, a chemical baron. According to the lawsuit filed by Richards' ex-wife, he also admitted to sexually assaulting his infant son in addition to his daughter between 2005 and 2007. Richards was initially indicted on two counts of second-degree child rape, felonies that translate to a 10-year mandatory jail sentence per count. He was released on $60,000 bail while awaiting his charges. Judge Jan Jurden, right,  said Roberts, the great grandson of Irenee du Pont, left, would benefit from participating in a sex offenders rehabilitation program rather than serving any prison time . Richards hired one of the state's top law firms and was offered a plea deal of one count of fourth-degree rape charges - which carried no mandatory minimum prison sentencing. He accepted, and admitted to the assault, reports the Detroit Free Press. Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden . sentenced Richards to eight years in prison but suspended that for Level . II probation, which requires monthly visits with a case officer. In sentencing him, Judge Jurden said Richards would benefit from participating in a sex offenders rehabilitation program rather than serving any prison time. Currently on probation, Richards has never been charged with crimes against his son. The lawsuit claims that Richards raped his daughter, now 11, in 2005 when she was three. Lawyers for Tracy Richards, far right, hold up photos of where her husband lives, the $1.8m mansion on the right and where she and their children currently rent on the left . Several times, he entered her bedroom at night while she slept and penetrated her with his fingers while masturbating, said the lawsuit, which includes documents from the criminal case. Abuse of the children occurred at both . of Richards' homes, including the 5,800-square-foot Greenville mansion that he paid $1.8 million for. Richards, who is 6'4 and about 250 lbs, told the girl 'to keep what he had done to her a secret,' but in October 2007 she told her grandmother, who informed Tracy Richards, the lawsuit said. The girl was taken to her pediatrician, whom she told about the abuse, and New Castle County police arrested him that December. Abuse of the children occurred at both of Richards' homes, including the 5,800-square-foot Greenville mansion that he paid $1.8 million for, pictured . The proven abuse of his daughter and alleged assault of his son has caused his children 'long-term injuries,' the lawsuit filed Tuesday said, perhaps including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sexual dysfunction and shame. His daughter also has 'repressed memories of some instances of the abuse she suffered,' and if the son was abused, the same is true with him, the suit said. With medical treatment, the lawsuit said, those memories will likely 'begin to surface.' 'Making matters worse this self admitted rapist and child abuser has not paid a single penny to these children for his crimes. There is no provision whatsoever for them for their future after they turn 18,' said Attorney Thomas Crumplar, who is representing Tracy Richards. At Tuesday's press conference he stood alongside Tracy and her mother Donna Burg. Burg, the maternal grandmother, is the one who alarmed Tracy of the abuse after talking to one of the grandchildren in 2007. Richards is a scion of two prominent Delaware families - the du Pont family who built the chemical empire and the Richards family who co-founded the prestigious corporate law firm Richards Layton & Finger. His father, Robert H. Richards III, was a partner in the law firm until his 2008 retirement.

"Arrest: Yolander Lasane, 45, was found living in deplorable conditions with 5 of her children . Five children have been found living in a filthy home brimming with trash, dog feces and urine-soaked beds, police in Florida have said. One of the children begged to be given a new family and opened his mouth to reveal a set of rotten teeth when investigators went inside the home in Orlando, according to a police report. Their mother, Yolander Lasane, 45, has been charged with child neglect after her children, aged 5, 9, 12, 15 and 17, are believed to have been living in the sickening conditions for several years. Photographs show clothing and trash strewn about the house, black mold and rotting wood in the kitchen and an insect-filled bathroom with a broken . toilet, sink and bathtub. Animal feces was also found over floors and walls, according to the police report. Police were called to the home by a Department of Children and Family worker, who told officers that she was concerned Lasane's 17-year-old child had not been home in three weeks. The teenager had never been reported missing and Lasane told authorities that she was troublesome and had been 'sleeping around', and did not think she had to report her missing. Disgusting: Images taken inside the home show mold- and food-covered services in the kitchen . Mold: Trash was also found in the sink where 5 children under the age of 17 were found living on Tuesday . Unhealthy: Police said they found very little food in the house, which had not been cleaned for years . The girl told police that her mother had thrown her out and told her never to return, so she had been staying with a friend. When she returned to pick up clothes, she said she found them thrown away. When they checked on the house, investigators had to use a shovel to remove the trash so they could get inside and were immediately hit by an overwhelming smell, according to the police report. Officers noted that the children did not look as if they had bathed recently and ate cold food out of cans using an electric can opener - the only working device in the kitchen. The children's beds were crawling with bugs, according to the report, and while Lasane's bedroom was also littered with trash and feces, it was in far better condition than her children's. 'Neglect': Lasane said that her weight made it . difficult for her to walk so she left her children to 'come and go as . they please'. Neighbors reported seeing the children in the street . looking for jobs for money . Filthy: The toilet, sink and bathtub were not working in the family's main bathroom, pictured . Stink: The children's bedrooms had urine-soaked beds and were strewn with animal feces . Mess: Authorities needed to use shovels to get inside the Orlando-area home on Tuesday . She had a working air conditioner and TV in her room. The mother said she has trouble walking due to her weight and stays in bed most of the time, meaning she leaves the children to 'come and go as they please'. But the Orlando Sentinel noted that she walked to the patrol car after her arrest. Officers also found that the doorknob on the front door of the house was hanging off and the home could not be locked. 'The severe medical and overall neglect was horrendous,' the report said. 'It was evident that no part of this residence had been properly cleaned or maintained in years.' Animal control also removed pets that had been neglected, the report said. Infested: Authorities also found bugs over the bedrooms and black mold over the doorways . Trash: The home, where the children had lived in poor conditions for years, has been condemned . The house has now been condemned. Neighbors said they would sometimes see one of her children wandering around the streets looking to work for money, according to WESH. The Department of Children and Families . has been working with the family for about a month, but said that they couldn't remove . the children from the home without giving the mother a chance. 'The last thing . we want to do is have to remove children from their home. We want to . maintain them in the home when we can safely do that,' DCF's Kristi Gray told WFTV. Lasane is being held at the Orange County Jail on five counts of child neglect causing great bodily harm. She has a sixth child who is grown and did not live at the house. A relative has temporarily taken in some of the children, and the state is arranging other permanent care for them.","Yolander Lasane, 45, charged with neglect after 5 of her children, aged 5, 9, 12, 15 and 17, 'lived in the deplorable conditions for years'

"A former Army staff sergeant is set to receive the Medal of Honor for his heroics during one of the deadliest battles of the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan. Staff Sergeant Ryan Pitts from Nashua, New Hampshire, spent an agonizing 90 minutes fighting off enemy fighters despite shrapnel injuries . to both legs and an arm that left the young soldier critically wounded . and resigned to certain death. President Obama is scheduled to bestow the medal on Pitts during a White House ceremony on July 21. It is the nation's highest decoration for battlefield valor. Scroll down for video . Former Army staff sergeant Ryan Pitts is set to receive the Medal of Honor for his heroics during one of the deadliest battles of the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan . Pitts also will become the ninth living recipient of the medal for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The medal recognizes the ‘courageous actions’ shown by Pitts while he served as a forward observer with 2nd Platoon, Chosen Company, 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade, when Vehicle Patrol Base Kahler, near Wanat Village in Kunar Province, in remote northeastern Afghanistan, came under full-scale assault by approximately 200 Taliban fighters on July 13, 2008. Nine paratroopers gave their lives and 27 were wounded at The Battle of Wanat. Deep into battle, Pitts found himself alone at the observation post and losing blood. He radioed to tell his superiors that everyone else was either dead or gone, but was told reinforcements were not available. Resigned to death, he began firing a grenade launcher almost directly overhead to where insurgents had concealed themselves. Pitts also will become the ninth living recipient of the medal for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan . Four soldiers soon made their way from the casualty collection point to find Pitts fighting for his life. They were followed by attack helicopters that provided air support. Despite being nearly unconscious, Pitts stayed in touch with headquarters and provided the feedback that was needed to help guide the air strikes. He was evacuated after fighting for more than an hour despite his wounds, along with three of the soldiers who came to his aid. The fourth soldier had been fatally wounded. ‘Throughout the battle, despite the loss of blood and severity of his wounds, Pitt's incredible toughness, determination, and ability to communicate with leadership while under fire allowed U.S. forces to hold the (observation post) and turn the tide of the battle,’ according to the military's narrative of the battle. President Obama is scheduled to bestow the Medal of Honor on Pitts, left, during a White House ceremony on July 21 . ‘Without his ability to stay alert and fight while critically wounded, the enemy would have gained a foothold on high ground and inflicted significantly greater causalities onto the vehicle patrol base, and the enemy could have been in possession of seven fallen Americans.’ Pitts left the service in October 2009 and currently works in business development for the computer software industry. He joined the Army in 2003 at age 17. Last week, Obama awarded the Medal of Honor to retired Cpl. William ‘Kyle’ Carpenter, who lost an eye after taking a grenade blast in Afghanistan to save a fellow Marine.","Ryan Pitts is set to receive the medal for his heroics during one of the deadliest battles of the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan .

"A young Indian woman has spoken out about being married to five husbands, all of whom are brothers. Rajo Verma, 21, lives in one room with the siblings and they sleep on blankets on the floor. The mother-of-one, who sleeps each night with a different brother, does not know which of her five related husbands is the father of her 18-month-old son. Happy family: Five brothers (L-R) Sant Ram Verma, 28, Bajju Verma, 32, Gopal Verma, 26, Guddu Verma, 21, and Dinesh Verma, 19, with their shared wife Rajo Verma, 20, and their son Jay Verma . The set-up may seem peculiar, but it is tradition in the small village near Dehradun, Northern India, for women to also marry the brothers of their first husband. She told the Sun: 'Initially it felt a bit awkward. 'But I don’t favour one over the other.' Rajo and first husband Guddu wed in an arranged Hindu marriage four years ago. Since then she has married Baiju, 32, Sant Ram, 28, Gopal, 26, and Dinesh, 19 - the latest in the line of husbands - who married her as soon as he turned 18. 'We all have sex with her but I’m not jealous,' first husband Guddu  - who remains the only official spouse - said. 'We’re one big happy family.' Tradition: The set up may seem peculiar, but it is custom in the small village near Dehradun, Northern India, for women to also marry the brothers of her first husband . Wife: They sleep together in turn, but that they do not have beds, just 'lots of blankets on the floor'. Rajo does not know which of the brothers is the father of her son . Housewife: Rajo said she got a lot more attention and love than many other wives . The practice of polyandry is believed to stem from the tale of Mahabharata, the ancient Indian epic. The text, one of the cornerstones of Indian culture, sees Draupadi, daughter of the King of Pancha being married to five brothers. It is not legal, but in its most common form - whereby women in polyandrous relationships marry more than one man from the same family - it is permitted. It tends to be practised in male dominated villages, who still follow primitive rituals and customs. Brothers who refuse the union are often treated as outcasts. In polyandrous families, the woman often cannot say which of her husbands fathered which children. Recently, there have been instances of DNA testing, to solve inheritance disputes. The ancient Hindu tradition of polyandry was once widely practiced in India, but is now only observed by a minority. It sees a woman take more than one husband, typically in areas which are male dominated. In fraternal polyandry the woman is expected to marry each of her original husband's brothers. It is thought to have arisen from the popular Sanskrit epic of Mahabharatha, which sees Draupadi, daughter of the King of Pancha being married to five brothers. The practice is also believed to be a way of keeping farming land in the family. It is most commonly found near the Himalayas in the north of the country, as well as in the mountainous nation of Tibet. While the advance of modernity has seen the archaic practice largely die out in most areas, the shortage of women in countries such as China and India has helped keep it alive as a solution to young men's difficulties in finding a wife. Rajo said she knew she was expected to accept all of her husbands, as her own mother had also been married to three brothers. She said they sleep together in turn, but that they do not have beds, just 'lots of blankets on the floor'. She added: 'I get a lot more attention and love than most wives.'","Rajo Verma, 21, lives in one room with the siblings, in Northern India .

"The bitter fall-out from the £5billion battle for Premier League rights went public on Friday when Sky unleashed their director of corporate affairs to attack BT Sport and defend Sky’s huge outlay. Graham McWilliam, who had previously called BT a ‘£22bn gorilla in puppy’s clothing’ for blacklisting Sky adverts, used his Twitter account to make seven points about the auction. Sky Sports pundits (L-R) Graeme Souness, Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry, Jamie Redknapp and Gary Neville . Graham McWilliam, Sky's Group Director of Corporate Affairs, took to Twitter on Friday . McWilliam, who has fewer than 500 Twitter followers despite his prominence at Sky, wrote: ‘Twice BT tried to muscle in and take PL rights from us. Twice Sky won max no of games. Blind auctions not for the faint-hearted. ‘Only one company achieved all its objectives in auction. Post-rationalisation by the runners-up can’t change that. ‘Sky went in hard to get the result. Yes, paid big. That’s what it takes. We can and will absorb it. 'Comparison of price paid ignores huge value gap. New deal gives Sky Sports even better match selections.’ BT Sport made a tame response saying: ‘We are very pleased with the outcome and the price we paid. 'BT Sport has an exciting line-up for football fans, including Premier League, FA Cup and the Champions and Europa Leagues.’ FA Chairman Greg Dyke has ordered every department of English football’s ruling body to find ways of cutting costs by 15 per cent. This will allow the FA to spend an extra £30million a year on grassroots pitches and coaches — identified by Dyke’s England Commission as a top priority. FA Chairman Greg Dyke watches the women's friendly between England and the USA on Friday . The biggest surprise of Phil Beard’s resignation as QPR chief executive was that he lasted three-and-a-half years in the role. Beard, a successful marketing executive who made money working with Sir Keith Mills on the Air Miles initiative, has always seemed unsuited to a football CEO role. And Beard might have walked out of Loftus Road last summer when owner Tony Fernandes over-ruled his opposition to signing Rio Ferdinand , who has proved an expensive transfer mistake. Qatar's beIN Sport, the richest TV network in the world, played no part in the Premier League auction. But their next move is mooted to be setting up a horse racing channel that may also include sponsoring English racing, which already benefits greatly from Qatar financial support. RFU’s database gold . The RFU, whose rampant commercial overdrive is evident all around Twickenham, will be rubbing their hands at gaining access to the huge online database built up by England Rugby 2015 to sell two million World Cup tickets. The names, email addresses and family details of so many rugby supporters will be direct-selling gold dust to the RFU, who previously interacted mostly with club secretaries rather than an enormous fan base. Jonathan Joseph catches the ball as England prepare at Twickenham for Saturday's Six Nations match . Sky Sports are not exactly short of cricket pundits. Yet the money-no-object network are expected to add former Australian captain Ricky Ponting to their Ashes team in the summer despite Sky already having more than enough Aussie cheerleading from loudmouth Shane Warne. And none of Sky’s Test regulars are due to make way for Ponting. Ricky Ponting (right) watches the Australian Open tennis men's final alongside his wife Rianna . The FA, who have sat on their hands over a number of serious discrimination issues this season, have been shown up by Essex FA.

Elliott said: ‘I used a phrase that means something to my age group, which I understand now causes huge offence — which is why I have resigned.’ The FA’s Club England administration of the national team looked to have been kicked into the long grass with the departure of its managing director Adrian Bevington. But it was a Club England pairing of chairman Greg Dyke and technical director Dan Ashworth who ruled that West Brom’s Saido Berahino should receive a written reprimand about a drink-driving conviction.","Graham McWilliam made seven points on Twitter about the rights auction .

"In the futuristic 1987 film Robocop it was depicted as a crime-ridden city left in ruins after years of financial decline. The film's writer Ed Neumeirer scribbled 'the future left Detroit behind' on the first page of the script to sum up the city where the story is set. Little did he know, his prophetic note would become an apt description of modern-day Detroit after the city filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in American history with debts of around $18 billion earlier this month. Scroll down for video . On the brink: The 1987 film Robocop, pictured, written by Ed Neumeirer is set in a futuristic crime-ridden Detroit on the verge of financial collapse . Modern-day Detroit: Graffiti decorates the ruins of the Packard Automotive Plant - a 35 acre site where luxury cars were manufactured until the 1950s . Mr Neumeier says Robocop, the story of a terminally-wounded officer who returns to the force as a powerful cyborg to police the city's crime-ridden streets, is a metaphor showing the 'industrial decline in America'. He insisted on Detroit being the setting for the film as it has always been very dependent on a single industry - car manufacturing which led to the city being dubbed 'Motor City' or 'Motown' because of this. But the decline of the industry in the 1980s, when Japan emerged as new rival in the automotive world, started to have a major impact on the city's prosperity. Mr Neumeier told CNN: 'The reason . Detroit is important is because it's facing an economic blight that you . can imagine happening in a lot of places. Decline: Buildings in what was once Detroit's prime business district sit largely abandoned after the city's population shrunk to 700,000 . The abandoned Fisher Body Plant in Detroit - the cradle of the automobile assembly line and a symbol of industrial might - after the city filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in American history after decades of decline . 'In retrospect, the idea of ""RoboCop"" really goes back to the car industry. The sculpture of it is very much . Detroit road-iron. Having grown up in the sixties when the muscle car . was so prominent, the notion of cars was very important to me then and . ultimately to the formation of RoboCop.' Looking to the future: Writer Ed Neumeier wrote 'the future left Detroit behind' on the first page of the Robocop script - which proved to be an accurate prediction of what would happen to the city . The U.S. government bailed out the automotive industry to the tune of $80 billion between 2008 and 2010 but that has done little to stop the financial decline in Detroit. It has an unemployment rate of 16 per cent of its 700,000 population as the number of jobs in the automotive industry continue to decline. Detroit was also been named the most dangerous city in America in 2012 by Forbes magazine and the most miserable in 2013. Those living in the city face major cuts to public services under debt restructuring proposals. The city's current plight shares striking similarities with the future Detroit portrayed in Robocop. In the film, Detroit is reliant upon a multinational corporation, called Omni Consumer Products (OCP), which runs everything from hospitals to its police force. Mr Neumeier believes that private companies are playing an ever increasing role in all areas of our lives - just like in Robocop. He said: 'We are now living in the world that I was proposing in RoboCop. We are increasingly asking corporations to do these things for us... to provide human services. But their objectives are different to public service needs.' Ironically, with a cheap and educated labour force, Mr Neumeier adds that Detroit is in need of a modernisation and advancement - making it the ideal place to start a robotics company. He added: 'There is a cheap and educated labor force. Some kind of high-tech would be good for them... I would say with the industrial and mechanical legacy there, somebody should start a robotics company.' Ruins: There are believed to be around 30,000 homes that need to be demolished in Detroit after decades of decline left it too poor to pay billions of dollars owed bondholders, retired cops and current city workers . Run down: A 'Neighborhood Watch' sign stands in front of dilapidated houses on Mackay Street in Detroit . Similarities: Robocop, about a wounded officer who is brought back as a cyborg to police Detroit's streets, proved to be an accurate prediction of the financial future of the city .","Futuristic film Robocop was set in a crime-ridden and dangerous Detroit .

Bradley(pictured) the 4lb dachshund who stood up to a 400lb black bear in order to save his owner's life . Saturday afternoon, a group of friends visiting the Force residence ventured into the woods and took Bradley along for the ride.

"A California hotel introduced a new bell hop on Tuesday: meet A.L.O, the industry's first robot butler. Robot butler: Meet the Botlr, the hospitality industry's first automated bellhop . Shortened to Botlr, the high tech hospitality technology will ferry amenities from the front desk of the Aloft in Cupertino to any of its 150 rooms in just three minutes or less. The Starwood company is using its Silicon Valley location as a test bed for the the speedy R2D2-like drone. 'As soon as A.L.O. entered the room, we knew it was what we were looking for. A.L.O. has the work ethic of Wall-E, the humor of Rosie from The Jetsons and reminds me of my favorite childhood robot, R2-D2.' Brian McGuinness of Starwood’s Specialty Select Brands said in a press release Tuesday. The 3-foot tall robot, made by the firm Savioke, features a smart vinyl collar and even a name tag. While running everything from razors to mail to Aloft guests, A.L.O. moves at a fast clip of up to 4mph. Meanwhile, Savioke says it manuevers through elevators and communicates easily with guests and staff. 'All of us at Savioke have seen the look of delight on those guests who receive a room delivery from a robot,' said Steve Cousins, CEO of Savioke. Starwood and Savioke hope to use the robot as a way to funnel existing human staff toward more sensitive tasks rather than a death knell for bellhops. With the delivery complete, the robot then asks for a review. If the guest inputs a positive remark on the built-in screen, the robot does a happy dance. Zippy: The Botlr debuted Tuesday at Aloft's Cupertino location, where it will zip up and down elevators to deliver amenities to any of the 150 guestrooms in three minutes or less . The accomplished drone then zips back to the elevator, sends a message instead of hitting the down button and returns to the lobby where it plugs itself in and awaits a new task. So how exactly will guests experience A.L.O.? According to the New York Times, the robot will arrive to guests' doors soon after they put in a request and will automatically place a call to the room instead of knocking. When the robot's sensors indicate the door has opened, it lifts its storage bin lid to reveal the requested item. A.L.O.'s official start date is August 20.

"Child actor Corey Feldman told police he was molested and who his abusers were more than 20 years ago but they did nothing about it, it was claimed today. The Goonies actor has opened up about the sexual abuse he suffered for years at the hands of 'older men in Hollywood' after his book Coreyography was released recently. A recording of Feldman speaking to Santa Barbara sheriffs recorded in December 1993 when the actor was 22 was obtained by RadarOnline. Opened up:The Stand By Me actor insists that Michael Jackson did not molest him . Tragic: Corey Feldman, center, has opened up about the sexual abuse he and fellow child actor Corey Haim, left, suffered in Hollywood . Feldman was being questioned in relation to the molestation charges brought against MIcahel Jackson by Jordy Chandler and his family. In his book the Stand By Me actor said his relationship with the pop king was one of the healthiest he had. In the recording, Feldman can be heard telling Sgt. Deborah Linden and Detective Russ Birchim, 'I myself was molested' before going on to name his abusers. The detectives expressed little to no concern but continued to keep the focus on Jackson. 'I know what it’s like to go through those feelings and believe me, the person who molested me, if this was him that did that to me, this would be a different story. 'I would be out there, up front, doing something immediately to have this man given what was due to him.' He alluded to this interview recently after a fan on Twitter asked him why he did not report the men to authorities. 'All names were given to police before statute had run out but they did zero,' he answered. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to requests for comment. Memoir: In a new book, Coreyography, pictured, Corey Feldman, from hit movies 'Stand By Me,' 'The Lost Boys,' 'Gremlins' and 'The Goonies,' recalls being told by trusted adults that it was normal for older men and young boys to have sexual relations in the industry . In the book, Feldman recalls his often twisted friendship with fellow child star Corey Haim . and how the pair were told by trusted adults that it was normal for . older men and young boys to have sexual relations in the industry. He named their abusers as Ron, Tony, Burnham and Crimson — all pseudonyms. The Lost Boys actor also explains his family life . wasn't happy: his former Playboy model mother dyed his hair blonde at . age four and tortured him about his weight, force-feeding him diet . pills. Meanwhile, his father only seemed to care about him when they . were getting high together, he writes. By the age of seven, Feldman was the family breadwinner, working as a commercial actor, and his mother banned him from riding a bicycle because she said he couldn't afford to get hurt. 'You have responsibilities now,' she said, according to excerpts of the book in The New York Post. When he began acting out on the set, and was fired from one TV movie, his mother was furious. '""How could you f****** do this to me?"" she screams. She is out of control, wild-eyed, like an animal. Her face is bright red and blotchy, her cheeks are streaked with mascara,' he recalls. '""You know I need this f****** money. I will kill you. I will f****** kill you, you worthless piece of s***.""' Naturally, he sought out adult role models at work. And while Steven Spielberg, who hired him for the first time for 'Gremlins,' became a trusted friend, other grown ups took advantage of him, he writes in the book. An assistant his father, who managed him for a time, hired called 'Ron' took him out on the town as a teenager and introduced him on to new drugs. One night, after taking a cocktail of pills 'Ron had made up', the man, in his early 20s, placed a hand on Feldman's thigh. Ron ended up having oral sex with the 'petrified' and 'revolted' Feldman that night, the teen too frightened to say no. 'I don’t know why I couldn’t confront Ron, but I was consumed with guilt. I felt like the whole thing was my fault,' Feldman penned. 'I desperately wanted him to stop, but I was afraid of losing my friend.' His . relationship with Ron lasted several years but Feldman also formed relationships . with other adults who reached out during this time. Sadly, these men, in many instances, turned out to be pedophiles. One picture in the book shows Feldman and Haim at the former's 15th birthday party flanked by five older men who at the time were abusing them. 'Slowly, over a period of many years I would begin to realize that many of the people I had surrounded myself with were monsters,' he writes. Interestingly, the only safe place he knew was with Michael Jackson. 'I was shattered, disgusted, devastated. I needed some normalcy in my life. So, I called Michael Jackson,' he recalls. The pair had been introduced by Spielberg. 'Michael Jackson's world, crazy as it sounds, had become my happy place. Being with Michael brought me back to my innocence. When I was with Michael, it was like being 10 years old again.' He insists in the book that Jackson never abused him or tried to touch him sexually. Death: Corey Feldman, left, and Corey Haim, right, starred in a TV series called 'The Two Coreys' in 2007 before Haim tragically died in 2010 following a long battle with drug addiction . During their first meeting, on the film The Lost Boys, Haim confided in his new friend that on the set of the 1986 film Lucas, 'an adult male convinced him that it was perfectly normal for older men and younger boys in the business to have sexual relations, that it was what all the guys do. So they walked off to a secluded area between two trailers... and Haim (was) sodomized.' The friends made nine films and starred in one TV series together and partied heavily, their increasingly damaging antics driven by the horrors of their abuse. After discovering his mother's stash of cocaine, Feldman's developed a dependance on drugs. He found himself snorting an eighth of an ounce every two days and bales of weed in his trailer. He recalled having 'regular coke-off challenges' with friends. Later he moved onto heroin. Haim was even more dependent. With his career all but over, Haim relapsed several times before dying of pneumonia in 2010 aged just 38. Feldman relapsed in 1995 but he said since then he's been clean. He now works on low budget horror films and has a 9-year-old son with ex-wife Playboy model Susie Sprague. But Feldman is adamant he will not be encouraging his son to follow him into child acting. 'People always ask me about life after childhood stardom. What would I say to parents of children in the industry?' he writes. 'My only advice, honestly, is to get these kids out of Hollywood and let them lead normal lives.'","Corey Feldman starred in hit movies Stand By Me, The Lost Boys, Gremlins and The Goonies .

"Arsenal MUST win the Champions League this season, or their star man will surely want out. Who knows what is going on in Alexis Sanchez’s mind but just put yourself in his boots for a second: what do you think is going on in his head when he takes a look at the Premier League table? During his little injury break I suspect he will be wondering whether he should be playing at a bigger club, a club capable of a genuine title challenge. Alexis Sanchez, pictured in action against Brighton, may be wondering whether his future is at Arsenal . The Chile international has shined for the Gunners so far this term, but the club are still outside the top four . He’s had the season of his life so far – he’s been shining virtually every week for Arsenal. Yet when he looks at the table he sees that his team is not even in the top four. How will Sanchez feel, having played so well, worked so hard, shown world-class quality, to see that those efforts have only managed to take Arsenal to fifth in the table? In the same way nobody really knows what was going on in Diego Costa’s mind last Tuesday when he was putting his stamp on that Capital One Cup tie, I can’t be sure what is going on in Sanchez’s head. But I’m guessing he will be feeling exasperated and frustrated, asking himself what he has to do to get this side challenging for the title. Sanchez, pictured grabbing hold of team-mate Mesut Ozil, missed the 5-0 victory over Aston Villa on Sunday . Will Sanchez be happy staying on the Arsene Wenger train where the destination is Mediocrity Central? Don’t get me wrong - I’m certain Arsenal will finish in the top four. And they’re still in the Champions League where a kind draw could take them all the way to a final where anything can happen over 90 or 120 minutes. But if Arsenal don’t win the Champions League where will that leave Sanchez? Will he be happy staying on the Arsene Wenger train – destination Mediocrity Central, calling at Low Expectations Junction and Fourth Place Trophyville? He’s bigger than that of course. He’s enjoying his football at Arsenal, some might argue. Just like he’d enjoy his football at a club that wins big trophies. Others will wonder how I can write this stuff after the Gunners have just won 5-0. It was against Aston Villa – it’s standard behaviour for Arsenal to batter weak teams more often than not. Chuba Akpom wins a penalty for Arsenal after he is fouled by Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan . Per Mertesacker congratulates Hector Bellerin after the Arsenal youngster scored his side's fifth goal . Theo Walcott was also on target in the win for Arsenal against a poor Aston Villa side at the Emirates Stadium . From the sidelines or sat in his living room Sanchez would have heard the ‘Oles’ of the Arsenal fans when their team was strolling to victory on Sunday. He might think it’s brilliant from the fans; or he might realise he’s at a club where standards and expectations are so low those fans are satisfied with a bit of keep ball when a terrible team comes to the Emirates. Quite what he made of the last 20 minutes of the game turning into a testimonial with everyone desperately passing to young Chuba Akpom hoping for him to score a goal is anyone’s guess. It’s all very sweet and nice from Arsenal to look after a young player, but a bigger win was easily achievable, and would have landed the Gunners in the top four. That would have been a huge statement. The elite challenge themselves – they don’t settle for fourth-best, it’s not in their mentality. That’s why Thierry Henry left in the end. Sanchez has an opportunity to do something this season not even Henry did for Arsenal – lead the Gunners’ charge to Champions League success. If they don’t achieve that glory, are all Arsenal fans confident their star man will want to stay? And if Arsenal do achieve European glory this season, will all 11 players get statues outside the Emirates? I do hope so.","Surely Alexis Sanchez will want out if Arsenal do not triumph in Europe?
He has been the club's star man, but Gunners are not even in the top four .
Arsenal should have beaten Aston Villa by a bigger margin... but players were happy to turn the Premier League clash into a testimonial .
Sanchez would have heard the 'Oles' from the Arsenal faithful at the end... are expectations so low, they're happy with keep-ball against a poor side?"

"Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson believes AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases are God's penalty for the 'immoral conduct' carried out by gay people. The reality TV star, who was briefly suspended from the A&E show last year after likening homosexuality to bestiality in a GQ interview, made his latest round of anti-gay comments during a Christian radio show as part of a tour to promote his new book. 'God says, ""One woman, one man,"" and everyone says, ""Oh, that's old hat, that's that old Bible stuff"",' he told host Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council, Think Progress reported. Scroll down for audio . Speaking out: Reality TV star Phil Robertson, pictured at the Republican Leadership Conference in May, has said gay people are stricken with horrible sexually transmitted diseases because of their 'immoral conduct' 'But I'm thinking, well let's see now. A clean guy - a disease-free guy and a disease-free woman - they marry and they keep their sex between the two of them. They're not going to get chlamydia, and gonorrhea, and syphilis, and AIDS. It's safe.' He continued: 'To me, either it's the wildest coincidence ever that horrible diseases follow immoral conduct, or, it's God saying, ""There's a penalty for that kind of conduct."" I'm leaning towards there's a penalty toward it.' He failed to mention that a disease-free man having sex with another disease-free man - or a disease-free woman having sex with another disease-free woman - would produce the same results. Robertson also did not touch upon his own previous conduct, which did not keep sexual relations between one man and one woman when he reportedly cheated on his wife, Kay. They are just the latest controversial comments from Robertson, who has unapologetically maintained his anti-gay stance, despite briefly being removed from Duck Dynasty last year. Fan favorite: Robertson, right, and his family make up the cast of Duck Dynasty. A&E briefly removed him from the show at the end of last year after he made anti-gay remarks during an interview with GQ magazine . On being moral: Robertson is pictured with his wife Kay, who previously said her husband cheated on her . In an interview with GQ last December, the millionaire duck hunter launched into his first attack. 'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what's wrong. Sin becomes fine,' he said in an interview with GQ last year. 'Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Being heard: He made the comments during a book tour for his new book, unPHILtered . 'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men... Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won't inherit the kingdom of God. 'Instead of acknowledging their sin, they railed against me for giving them the truth about their sins. Don't deceive yourselves' He also grouped homosexuals with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone on who's going to heaven, hell. That's the Almighty's job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they're homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I'm saying?' After the interview emerged, Robertson was put on indefinite hiatus from Duck Dynasty. While his removal was lauded by gay rights organizations, fans of the show and conservative supporters, including Sarah Palin, denounced it as a violation of his right to free speech. A&E initially said his views were 'disappointing' but two weeks later, they announced that Robertson would be included when they began filming again in the new year. His rants have continued, including in a sermon at a West Monroe, Louisiana church in May when he said people had lashed out at him 'for giving them the truth about their sins'. In an ABC News interview last week, he defended himself again, saying: 'I'm as much of a homophobe as Jesus was,. The people who are participating in homosexual behavior, they need to know that I love them.'","Reality TV star made his latest offensive comments during a phone-in interview on a Christian-themed radio show .

"I was at Old Trafford on Saturday to see Manchester United comfortably beat Leicester City 3-1 and one of the standout players was Luke Shaw. It occurred to me that this guy has every chance of going on to be a Manchester United legend over the next 15 to 20 years. But could he end up being United’s best ever left back, overtaking Denis Irwin, much loved by United die-hards, much underrated outside of the club? That’s a tough ask given the amount of success Irwin enjoyed  - he remains United’s second most decorated player behind Ryan Giggs. He was a rare breed, as sound defensively as he was going forward, and I see both those qualities in Shaw. Luke Shaw was one for Manchester United's best players in their 3-1 victory against Leicester City . The England international was full of running on Saturday... now he needs a long-term run of fitness . Denis Irwin is United's greatest left back, pictured here celebrating a goal against Middlesbrough in 1999 . It’s hard to believe he is still only a teenager. But at just 19 he has the time to play more games than the 529 Irwin appeared in, and even more than the 602 made by another celebrated United full back, Gary Neville. There are just two things missing from Shaw’s game right now, and one of them – a long-term consistent run of fitness – could hold him back for club and country. Shaw heard Louis van Gaal’s public criticism of his fitness levels earlier in the season and admitted the United manager was right. On Saturday Shaw played the full 90 minutes, and gave an energetic display up and down the left flank no problem. He seems to have learned his lesson, after declaring he needed to achieve a far greater level of fitness at United than he had at Southampton. But he has picked up a few niggling injuries this season, keeping him out of action on three occasions. It could just be bad luck of course, but he’ll be keen to cut those spells on the sidelines down. Shaw, pictured in action in Manchester United's FA Cup draw at Cambridge in January . Irwin pictured celebrating with Gary Neville after United beat Barcelona in the 1999 Champions League final . Irwin played more than 500 games for United, and was a favourite among the club's supporters . Physically he’s on the way to being a beast, and his ability is obvious. Some have questioned his defensive strength – he makes mistakes like all defenders, but not a significantly high number of errors, his tackling generally looks effective, and his reading of opponents seems sound. The other area lacking in his game is goals. In 79 first-team appearances with Southampton and United, he has yet to register a goal, and from what I’ve seen he’s not even looked like scoring. Goals are not Shaw’s priority of course, and he shouldn’t be judged as a good or bad player based on the amount of goals he scores. But Irwin weighed in with a few, endearing him still more to the Old Trafford faithful. I like Shaw a lot, and I suspect United fans already realise they have a quality player on their hands. If he applies himself, and stays fit, he’s set to be United’s left back – and probably England’s left back – for many years to come. It’s not easy becoming a Manchester United legend, but Shaw has that opportunity right in front of him.","Luke Shaw was one of Man United's standout players against Leicester .

"An explosive new book claims to uncover some of the shocking lows that have accompanied Kate Moss’ meteoric rise to establishing herself as a fashion icon and supermodel who has remained at the top of her field for the past quarter of a century. Champagne Supernova lifts the lid on her humble beginnings, how she came to define the ‘grunge’ look of the 90s and how despite all the tremendous success that followed she repeatedly sought escape in sex, drugs and alcohol - especially after Johnny Depp 'broke her heart.' Kate was famously discovered by a modeling agent at age 14, as she walked through JFK Airport with her middle-class British parents. Scroll down for videos . An explosive new book claims to uncover some of the shocking lows that have accompanied Kate Moss’ meteoric rise to establishing herself as a fashion icon over the past quarter of a century . But her road to supermodel success was no sure thing. As a skinny, flat-chested teen with crooked teeth, her look was completely at odds with the ‘Glamazons’ and gold-plated excess of the 1980s, writes author Maureen Callahan. A Polaroid of Kate was stuck in the ‘maybe’ drawer until her mentor, the fashion photographer Corinne Day, rescued it and launched her career in 1990 with a striking image featured on the cover of UK style bible The Face. When Day discovered Kate in Croydon, South London, her parents were separating and she was skipping school to party at a local pub and get high. She had also lost her virginity at fourteen. In 1992, Kate was picked as the new face of Calvin Klein. Self-conscious about her small breasts, she dreaded the topless ads and didn’t like being teamed up with Mark Wahlberg, known then as Marky Mark who had ‘a bulging physique and a bad attitude’ and ‘spent downtime tugging his d**k while Kate rolled her eyes’, writes Callahan. Self-conscious about her small breasts, Kate dreaded the topless ads and didn’t like being teamed up with Mark Wahlberg, known then as Marky Mark who had ‘a bulging physique and a bad attitude’ Wahlberg thought Kate looked like his nephew. But the decision to feature Kate in the stripped-down CK ads proved a masterstroke for both parties as it helped turn the ailing fashion label around and also made her a household name. Soon she was the sole face of Calvin Klein jeans – with her photo soon featured on the sides of buses, kiosks, pay phones - naked and draped across a sofa. She became the ‘grunge goddess of the U.K.’ and quickly rose to international acclaim, but soon the success started to take its toll on the young model. Kate had been described as ‘no glamor, no figure, bowed legs and jagged teeth and one eye that was slight off-center’, but suddenly she was considered the epitome of the new grunge aesthetic. Her drinking escalated and sometimes she didn’t get out of bed for two weeks, writes Callahan. ‘Nobody takes care of you mentally’, Kate said of her sudden success. ‘I thought I was going to die’. Two years later in 1994, Kate was the face of YSL Opium perfume. At Café Tabac in New York's East Village, she met the man she had been obsessing over for months, actor Johnny Depp. ‘Both had ravenous appetites for alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, sex. Kate was the accidental supermodel, Depp the punk-rock Beat poet who just happened to become a movie star,’ writes Callahan. Kate met Johnny Depp in 1994 at Café Tabac in New York's East Village and he broke up with her for good - breaking her heart - at Cannes in 1997 . Kate threw herself into partying with her movie-star and rock-star friends in North London and is reported to have enjoyed a threesome with Jude Law and his then wife wife Sadie Frost . When Kate hooked up with Depp, he was divorced from his first wife, Lori Anne Allison and had been engaged to Jennifer Grey, Sherilyn Fenn and Winona Ryder. ‘Kate and Johnny were the chicest, druggiest couple since Keith Richards and Anita Pallenberg’, writes Callahan. But Kate feared Johnny’s moods and was afraid he’d leave her. She was constantly insecure about her face, her small breasts, short legs, and bad teeth. By 1996, her drug  use had spiraled out of controlled while Depp was slowing down, claims Callahan. He couldn’t take it any longer. ‘In one sitting she could snort three grams of coke and drink a bottle of vodka, which a doctor said was the best liquor for preserving her looks,’ writes Callahan. She was called ‘the Tank’ for drinking so hard and fast. Depp and Moss broke up for good after the premiere of his directorial debut, the Brave, at Cannes in 1997. He couldn’t live with her in New York because he couldn’t take her wild partying and neediness. He told Kate she was ‘a crazy b****’, a friend told Callahan. ‘Johnny broke her heart. She went mad’. She was spinning out of control on drugs - heroin and booze. ‘She just wouldn’t stop with the drugs and the drinking’. In 2005 Kate hooked up with singer Pete Doherty, left, ‘a junkie, thief and former gay hustler’, before marrying Jamie Hince, right, in 2011 . ‘Kate had the highest tolerance…, capable of doing ‘cocaine, champagne in piles, an eight-ball by herself…and not even be fazed by it’, the author quotes a friend. ‘She can drink anyone under the table …a liter of vodka in one sitting. There’s not much she doesn’t like. She doesn’t like her own company. She’s addled by the drugs and doesn't like to think’. Kate threw herself into partying with her movie-star and rock-star friends in North London. They became known in the tabloids as 'the Primrose Hill set,' after the posh neighborhood they shared. Around this time it was reported in the British tabloids that Kate was enjoying hookups with several of her female friends - including Jude Law’s wife, Sadie Frost, who, a friend says, began to fall in love with Kate. 'They all partied together, slept together,' a colleague tells Callahan. 'It was a very soulless life they led.' 'She doesn’t like her own company,' said one family friend of that time. 'She’s addled by the drugs and doesn’t like to think.' When Depp hooked up with French singer Vanessa Paradis - who became pregnant within weeks - Kate spun even more out of control. She took off for a wild two weeks in Ibiza, and Jason Lake, her island hookup, expressing amazement that this 'kinda rough' girl who knocked back vodka and tequila every night was the world’s most famous model. In the early 90s Kate became the sole face of Calvin Klein jeans and her photo featured on the sides of buses, kiosks, pay phones - naked and draped across a sofa . Champagne Supernovas, left, is out now and, right, the infamous cover of The Face which set Kate on the road to stardom back in 1990 . 'I was living fast,' Kate said of that time. 'It was, ""Sleep? Why? Why not go on? There’s too much to do.'"" She eventually checked into the Priory, the mental health rehab center in South West London for five weeks, but only a few days after leaving she was back on the drugs, writes Callahan. ‘She hadn’t walked down a runway sober in over a decade or done a shoot where she wasn’t on something’. She partied in Thailand with Ronnie Wood’s son Jesse and in March was rushed to the hospital. She started seeing a psychiatrist once a week and going to AA and Narcotics Anonymous. Keeping her partying behind closed doors, she was even more out of control and was known to 'station herself outside the bathroom door, yelling, ""Anyone want a f***?'"", writes Callahan. By 2000, she was a fashion icon without having to walk a catwalk. Five years later, when she hooked up with singer Pete Doherty, ‘a junkie, thief and former gay hustler’, she was back on heroin, claims Callahan. When photographs surfaced of her chopping up cocaine, she lost her contracts. Back into rehab, she broke off with Doherty and again quit heroin. In 2011 she married her husband Jamie Hince and the couple remain together to this day. Kate became the ‘grunge goddess of the U.K.’, but soon the success started to take its toll and  friends called her 'the Tank' because she drank so hard and fast . Today Kate Moss has remained at top of her field for so long that it’s difficult to remember a time before she was a model. As she has matured, her unique style has emerged, mixing high-end designer items with vintage finds, dresses with sneakers and shorts with rain boots. Callahan argues that Moss is the most influential model in history, inspiring fashion lines from paparazzi street photos and popularizing staples like skinny jeans and ballet flats. Champagne Supernovas also looks at the careers of two of the other biggest names of the 90s fashion era - designers Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen. The book's title has three meanings: 'champagne supernova' is a psychedelic song by the '90s rock band Oasis and can refer to bubbly in a martini glass rimmed with cocaine. A supernova is also when a star gets so bright it explodes, the perfect metaphor for all three profiled in the book.","A new book claims to lift the lid on Kate Moss' wild partying ways involving consuming large amounts of drink and drugs .

"I've always been supportive of referees. Of course you call the errors, but generally speaking I like to think I have an appreciation of the difficulty of the job referees do and that is reflected in my assessment of their performance. I do feel managers use referees as a way of deflecting blame away from themselves and their players and that a lot of players and bosses need to look in the mirror before looking at the referee. But this season, officials are making it more and more difficult for those of us who defend them from inevitable criticism. Some of the errors made have been astonishingly bad, and have left me wondering two things: do they actually know the laws of the game? And secondly, are they actually watching the game properly? Jose Fonte went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee Bobby Madley having a clear view . Newcastle's Emmanuel Riviere protested to referee Madley, who waved his appeals away immediately . Despite Riviere's impassioned appeals to the official, Newcastle were not awarded the penalty at St James' I'm not a fan of managers focusing on referees but I have a lot of sympathy with Everton boss Roberto Martinez when he said this ahead of their Monday night game with West Bromwich Albion: 'They (PGMOL) accept there's been an honest error made but there have been too many now. 'Referees are part of the game and the error of the referee makes the game what it is. It's tough to take when you've got six or seven big calls which didn't go your way and scorelines could have changed.' I still believe Martinez needs to address his own shortcomings before he tries to think he knows what's best for match officials, but he has a point nonetheless. Everton have had some shocking decisions go against them this season – notably at Manchester City in the Premier League defeat last month. Everton manager Roberto Martinez has had his fair share of decisions going against hiM . So this weekend I decided to study four games at random to see how bad the situation was. In each game, there were decisions that weren't just questionable, they were downright terrible: . 1. The inexplicable offside decision which robbed Jan Vertonghen and Spurs of a goal against Sunderland. It was high drama right at the end, so the fans were also robbed of a brilliant moment. If you've seen the incident you'll know how bad it is. The linesman remembered one important rule about needing two opponents between the 'attacker' and the goal, but he forgot the even more basic law that you can't be offside in your own half. The referee Chris Foy was in the vicinity as well, but failed to overrule a ridiculous decision. This is a linesman and a referee either not knowing the laws of the game, or forgetting them during the 90 minutes. Either way, it's poor from both. Replays clearly showed Jan Vertonghen was inside his own half as he ran clear to score a disallowed goal . The Belgian's celebrations were cut short when assistant Stuart Burt inexplicably flagged for offside . Belgium defender Vertonghen couldn't believe his bad luck but Tottenham still went on to win the match . 2. Jose Fonte's handball in the late stages of Southampton's victory at Newcastle. Referee Bobby Madley had a clear view from a good position, so what was he watching? How could he possibly interpret that handball as anything other than a penalty? 3. Bobby Madley's brother Andy also took up a good position on a set-piece as Nottingham Forest threatened Derby County. But despite staring straight at Derby's Jake Buxton grabbing hold of Forest's Michail Antonio and hauling him to the floor, Madley decided not to award a penalty. He let play continue. What was he watching? Jose Fonte went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee Bobby Madley having a clear view . Newcastle's Emmanuel Riviere protested to referee Madley, who waves his appeals away . Despite Riviere's impassioned appeals to the official, Newcastle were not awarded the penalty . 4. Mike Jones awarded handball against Leicester's Wes Morgan earlier this season at Anfield when the ball clearly hit the defender's face, so the official has found himself demoted to the Championship where the nightmare continues (in fairness, he was faultless when reffing the FA Cup tie between Blyth Spartans and Birmingham earlier this month). Wes Morgan was penalised even though the ball clearly hit his face as Raheem Sterling attacked for Liverpool . On Saturday, Jones was at the DW Stadium to control Wigan's 1-1 draw with Blackburn. Wigan's James McClean charged towards Rovers' Marcus Olsson, lunged in late after the ball had gone and took the defender off his feet. It was a horrible challenge, potential leg-breaker and understandably the Blackburn players were livid. Jones decided it was only worthy of a yellow card. The linesman was maybe more to blame – he was right on top of the incident. It's a clear red card, so why didn't Jones give it? To make matters worse, McClean headed Wigan's equaliser later in the game. Wigan's James McClean (pictured) charged towards Blackburn's Marcus Olsson but went unpunished . So why are these glaring errors happening more and more? Honest mistakes are fine, but these are the kind of blunders which if translated and applied to other jobs would get people sacked or killed. A lorry driver doesn't look properly as he approaches a roundabout – it's potentially fatal. If I don't know broadcasting law, I might say something I'm not allowed to and I get sacked from talkSPORT. So why are so many officials failing to do their jobs properly? These aren't dishonest mistakes of course, but they fall way below the standard that should be set in a professional industry. My theory is this: goal-line technology has come in and been a success (expensive of course and it isn't used anywhere near as often as its advocates led us to believe it would be, but it's been a positive). The arrival of technology has changed the mindset of officials. I think subconsciously some referees and linesmen have 'downed tools' and stopped doing their jobs properly, stopped concentrating, stopped watching the game closely. Why? Because they want more technology to come in so they can wash their hands of any responsibility. They know they'll still get paid as professional refs, but they also know there will be less pressure on them as individuals because they'll be able to refer incidents to a 'video ref.' Back to basics please. Ref it right, or ref off. Vincent Kompany reacts after Mike Dean blows his whistle to award a penalty to Arsenal at the Etihad .

"Challenge: Chris Sevier, who wants to marry his laptop, has claimed he should be allowed the same rights as same-sex couples . An army veteran has challenged a court decision denying him the right to marry his laptop in a bizarre case that loosely resembles the plot of Oscar-winning film Her. Chris Sevier has filed a motion to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeal arguing that if same-sex couples are allowed to wed, he should be able to tie the knot with his Macbook. The amateur model claims computers are his 'preferred sexual object' and enjoys sex with the devices more than with 'real women'. He tried to marry the device, which he says is laden with porn, but the licence was rejected by Utah officials on the grounds of 'sexual orientation'. The case bears similarities to Her, a Spike Jonze film in which the protagonist, played by Joaquin Phoenix, falls in love with his operating system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Jonze picked up the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. In Sevier's motion, which is 50 pages long, Mr Sevier states: 'They discriminated against me when they rejected my request to marry my computer. 'I approached the Utah clerk to have a marriage licence issued for me and my machine-spouse. 'The clerk denied my request for a marriage licence … my object of affection was outside the scope of the narrow definition. 'If gays have the right to “marry their object of sexual desire, even if they . lack corresponding sexual parts, then I should have the right to marry my . preferred sexual object,' he added. Scroll down for video . Comparison: Sevier's situation is similar to the film Her, where a man, played by Joaquin Phoenix, falls in love with his operating system . Relationship: He told the court that, over time, he started preferring sex with his laptop over 'real women' The motion continues: 'The true . question presented here is whether traditional marriage is a . relationship that is stand alone and unequal to all other forms of . sexual and spiritual unions. 'The . Constitutionality of the law in dispute narrowly defines marriage . between one man and one women, not one man and one man, one woman and . one woman, one man and one machine, one man and one animal.'To strengthen the claim, Mr Sevier cites legal precedents from around the world - including a case where a . woman married a dolphin and a Chinese man wed a cardboard cutout of himself. The courts in the US found his argument was not persuasive enough, and ruled against him. A judge said it was 'removed from reality' and had 'no place' in an ongoing lawsuit, which is challenging the premise of same-sex marriage legislation. Last year Mr Sevier sued Apple claiming the tech giant . should have blocked him from accessing porn when he, apparently by . accident, typed 'F***book.com instead of Facebook into Google. Sevier went on in the complaint to . allege 'unfair competition' between the porn stars and his wife, brought . about by his use of the Apple product, and thus 'interference of the . marital contract.' Mr Sevier has previously tried to sue TV network A&E for firing Duck . Dynasty's Phil Robertson in the because of alleged homophobic comments.

"It is now seven years since Ron Dennis was asked what he considered the biggest difference between managing the rivalry of Senna and Prost in the late 1980s and the then current enmity of Hamilton and Alonso. ‘The internet,’ he said. It struck me as an extraordinarily insignificant development for the boss of McLaren to be worrying about amid a multi-million-pound budget, a World Championship fight and Spygate. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hamilton drive a Reliant Robin and Rosberg's driving selfie . Tension? Leiws Hamilton tweeted (below) that he and Nico Rosberg are 'still friends' and had ups and downs . But I now feel he was on to something relevant that has advanced at speed in the intervening years. Social media, most pertinently Twitter, has taken off, for the most part widening rather than deepening the debate (or so I would contend as a hopeless reactionary). Everyone is an instant expert, even from his armchair. Whether social media is good or bad, how an organisation, for our purposes an F1 team, delivers its news, controls its message and engages with its fans has changed irrevocably. We saw this when Lewis Hamilton tweeted that he had ‘no problem’ with his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, having publicly fallen out with him at Monaco last weekend over qualifying. ‘We’ve been friends a long time,’ said Hamilton. ‘As friends we have our ups and downs. Today we spoke and we’re cool. Still friends.’ As I wrote in a separate news piece about this on Friday, the timing of the announcement was odd. I shall elaborate on my understanding of what happened in the hours leading to Hamilton’s tweet. I spoke to Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, Friday morning. He said: ‘I have to tell you that everything is fully under control. Everything is back in order. ‘I spoke to Lewis he said he would speak to Nico. From my point of view there are no negatives.’ Those quotes, and others from Lauda, were going to form the main item in this column. To check a couple of points, I phoned a Mercedes spokesman. I specifically asked whether the two drivers had yet talked to each other. The spokesman said he did not know and thought it unlikely he could find out because Hamilton, he thought, was travelling across the Atlantic ahead of next weekend’s race in Canada. Odd timing: Hamilton's Tweet came at an odd juncture - after Niki Lauda had announced the pair had spoken . Just over an hour later, Sky issued a tweet encouraging viewers to contribute to a debate, on the F1 Show, tackling the fractious relationship between Hamilton and Rosberg. Eleven minutes after Sky’s tweet, came Hamilton’s tweet. So, were any of the events connected? Did Mercedes’ corporate types want to take control of the agenda, rather than let Lauda, who I suspect they think is too prone to go freelance with his views, set it? Did they wish to steer Sky’s treatment of the subject towards a discussion of a rapprochement? Mercedes deny it, of course. The same spokesman told me that Lewis tweeted independently of them, purely to reflect the updated situation. The spokesman’s revised estimate of Lewis’ itinerary was that he was ‘probably’ travelling to Canada this weekend. Under control: Mercedes chairman Niki Lauda claimed everything was fine between the pair . I don’t know whether my suspicions that Mercedes had a hand in the tweet are right – and who can blame them if they did? It is someone’s job to have the acumen to do so. A legitimate complaint from a journalist would be if the spokesman reacted to my call – in which I let him into the fact that Lauda had spoken to me – by feeding a tweet to every rival and so ruining the exclusivity of my story, such as it was. A final thought. Did Hamilton send his tweet – and choose the perfect picture of himself and Rosberg on unicycles as boys to illustrate a long and fun association – all on his own? Did he not run it by anyone at the office of Simon Fuller, his manager? Or anyone at Mercedes? I find it difficult to believe that he neglected to do so given the sensitivity of the last few days. That is the way communications work these days. We should at least be aware of this. We can then evaluate sensibly what is said, by whom, and how and when. Denial: The German team deny there was anything untoward about the timing of Hamilton's tweet . It is interesting to conjecture what the reaction would have been had Hamilton prevented Rosberg’s flying lap rather than the other way around. I suspect some fans would be split along tribal lines, just as they are now; that the stewards would have approached the incident as neutrally as they could; and that commentators, among them ex-drivers, would still try to be honest in their reading of it. But if Hamilton were judged less sympathetically would that entirely be the fault of us observers? For he has been attracted to controversy like a baby to milk throughout his Formula One career; Rosberg has been squeaky-clean. Not that there are not upsides to Hamilton’s headline-grabbing deeds, good and bad. Only last week he was named the world’s most marketable sportsman. His story in the round makes him what the American’s call ‘box office’. Squeaky clean: Rosberg has a clean record in comparison to Hamilton, who has attracted controversy . In his spare days between defending himself against bribery charges in a Munich court, Bernie Ecclestone has been trying to sell shares belonging to the sport’s largest shareholders, CVC. But I can reveal that talks with Canadian fashion tycoon Lawrence Stroll, whose interest in buying into F1 was first reported by Sky, have broken down. With F1’s other investors nervous about Ecclestone’s future, the sport’s future remains in flux. Derek Warwick, the driver steward in Monaco, explained to Sportsmail how the panel came to their decision not to penalise Rosberg. I have read that offering this explanation in print and online compromised his independence. No, that is a non-sequitur. I am more inclined to thank him for his transparency. I liked Graeme Lowdon’s line after his driver Jules Bianchi’s ninth place for Marussia last weekend. ‘Trust us to score our first points in Monaco – we can’t afford to celebrate,’ he said, hinting humorously at his team’s belief that they do not receive an equitable share of the sport’s profits. But am I alone in detecting an irony in what Lowdon – who is grandiloquently called Marussia’s president – said? Running Formula One cars in the plutocrats’ playground of Monaco is hardly the breadline. Off the mark: Jules Bianchi fianlly scored Marussa's first points after finishing ninth in Monaco .","Niki Lauda told me the Hamilton and Rosberg had spoken .

Ferguson officer Darren Wilson had 'severe facial injuries' after being beaten by Michael Brown, a police source said on Wednesday . Michael Brown, 18, reportedly badly beat Officer Wilson before he was shot dead on August 9 . Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries. Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime. He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him. Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has come under fire after calling for the 'vigorous prosecution' of Wilson despite the fact that the officer has not yet been charged with any crime. His deputy, Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder said: 'It's really heartbreaking to see a man elected to an office that high in our state government... come out with a statement like that, that does prejudge the case.' St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said on Wednesday he estimated it would be the middle of October before the grand jury reached a decision on whether Officer Wilson will face charges over Michael Brown's death.

Police still stood guard, but many wore regular uniforms rather than riot gear. Officer Darren Wilson was caught on cellphone footage looking at Michael Brown's lifeless body after he fired six shots at the unarmed teen on a Ferguson street on August 9.

On August . 9, Officer Wilson had been attending a separate medical emergency call . shortly before midday. He left that incident and came across Michael . Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson walking in the middle of Canfield . Avenue in Ferguson. According . to Fox, the police source said Brown and Johnson ignored him.

"On TV: Labour Peer Lord Falconer (pictured) appeared on BBC One to discuss plans for an assisted suicide law, but nobody represented the opposing view . The BBC has been accused of bias in its coverage of assisted suicide by a campaigner whose TV appearance was cancelled at the last minute. A Christian doctor was due to oppose Labour peer Lord Falconer when he appeared on the BBC One Breakfast show to discuss his plans for an assisted dying law. But he was then told that he was no longer needed, and Lord Falconer appeared on the programme alone. Dr Peter Saunders, the campaigner director of anti-euthanasia group Care Not Killing, has complained to the Corporation after a planned appearance on the show to challenge Lord Falconer was called off. The two had previously discussed the issue on the Today programme in 2012. In a letter sent to BBC Director General Tony Hall, seen by The Sunday Telegraph, Dr Saunders said the Corporation had: 'consistently promoted an agenda seeking to change the law on assisted suicide and euthanasia'. He added: 'The BBC has consistently acted as the . cheerleader for legalising assisted suicide, a move that would lead to . huge pressure on the terminally ill and disabled to end their lives.' Dr Saunders has also claimed that the majority of medical opinion is against a change in the law to support assisted suicide. The BBC has attracted numerous complaints in recent years over the prominence it has given to 'right to die' programmes - which are often very emotive. A programme called Choosing to Die, presented to novelist and campaigner Sir Terry Pratchett, who has Alzheimer's disease, attracted 1,200 complaints when it was aired in 2011. The programme followed a 71-year-old man who suffered from motor neurone disease, and showed the last moments of his life in a Dignitas assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland. Campaigner: Sir Terry Pratchett, pictured, presented an emotive programme on assisted suicide which attracted more than 1,000 complaints . In 2010 a group of MPs said the Corporation 'misused public funds' and 'ignored the rights of the disabled' in a Commons motion which threatened to cut the BBC's public funding unless the issue was 'treated impartially'. A BBC spokesperson said: 'Assisted suicide is an emotive subject which divides opinion. 'After much discussion within the editorial team it was felt that a single interview, in which Lord Falconer could be questioned fully on his views and proposals would be more suitable on this occasion. 'Our presenters strongly challenged his views and were careful to include the views of groups like 'Care not Killing' during the interview.'","Labour's Lord Falconer discussed assisted dying plans unopposed on BBC .

"Like a king with a royal proclamation, the inventor of the GIF file format has put an end to all debate over how his invention’s name shall be pronounced. Or so he wishes. ‘It is a soft “G,” pronounced “jif.” End of story,’ said Steve Wilhite. The man who gave the world the quintessential meme-making file type hath spoken. But was there really that much question? In a word: yes. So says he: Steven Wilhite, inventor of the GIF, accepts a Webby Lifetime Achievement award May 21. He says his invention is pronounced with a soft 'g.' Once just a part of the jargon of hardcore computer enthusiasts, how to properly say GIF has been debated since it was invented in 1987 as a means of neatly compressing images. It has since become synonymous, with the help of a famous dancing baby, with brief and catchy animated images. You need only visit a Tumblr page or peruse any Buzzfeed article to see how ubiquitous the once nerdy name has become. And you need only run a Google search for ‘How to pronounce’ to see how active the pronunciation war remains. Before you’ve even hit the ‘G,’ the engine has already guessed what you were thinking. The internet is rampant with websites, blogs, and articles dedicated to the question of how to pronounce the shortened form of Graphics Interchange Format. Choosy: An image by the heavy GIF users at Buzzfeed concurs, likeing the pronunciation to that of the ubiquitous peanut butter . A Tumblr dedicated to the question exists, though it comes to no solid conclusion. There is also the GIF Pronunciation Page, which takes the side of Mr. Wilhite, who purportedly uses the mnemonic device ‘Choosy developers choose GIF,’ to remind everyone it’s a soft ‘G’ just like the peanut butter. There's also a Youtube video on the subject. Even the president of the United States has taken a stand. When the White House debuted its own Tumblr page in April, it posted a graph of what to expect on its new microblog. Among the offerings was ‘Animated GIFs (Hard “G”)’. And that is, if you were wondering, the other way to speak the term. A hard ‘G’ like in ‘gift.’ Partisanship: Barack Obama, disagrees. The official White House Tumblr promises 'Animated GIFs (HARD ""G"")' But don’t mention that to Wilhite. And don’t try to say both are correct, either. ‘The Oxford English Dictionary accepts both pronunciations,’ Mr. Wilhite said in an email interview with the New York Times. ‘They are wrong.’ Wilhite’s invention has won him much praise over the last 25 years and even more in the last five or so as meme culture has embraced the file as a means of quickly and easily moving messages motivated by everything from comedy to politics across the Web. Wilhite was even honored Tuesday with a Lifetime Achievement Webb Award in recognition of inventing the file format. In the words of the official Webby website: . ‘The proliferation of the GIF within today's meme-powered, Tumblr-driven pop culture, proves it a lasting format still among the most celebrated on the Web (despite the hotly contested controversy over its correct pronunciation). With 2012 being the 25th anniversary of the GIF we think the 17th Annual Webby Awards is a most fitting event to honor and celebrate Steve Wilhite and this historical achievement.’ Brave: But even in the face of tyranny and elitism, the GIF's inventor stands firm. 'The Oxford English Dictionary accepts both pronunciations' he said. ¿They are wrong.¿ .",Steven Wilhite accepted a Life Time Achievement Webby Award on May 21 for giving the gift of the GIF to the world .
"It is seen by some as a flaw. For others, an adorable facial feature. And for an increasing number of women all over the world, dimples are so desirable, they are willing to have surgery to achieve them. 'People like dimples, it's a unique group, a tremendous interest in it and we are surprised by the people who want to have dimples,' Dr Amiya Prasad, a New York-based cosmetic surgeon, tells Fox 10 news. Dimpleplasty, as it's known, has been around for some 30 years, but it has gained popularity in recent times - thanks in part to dimple-cheeked celebrity icons like Kate Middleton - and is one of the more affordable cosmetic procedures available today. Easy job: Dr Prasad, a New York-based cosmetic surgeon, performs this dimpleplasty in just half an hour, to give Lee Williams (center) the cherubic grin she's always longed for . At a cost of between $1,200 and $2,500, depending on the surgeon, the surgery takes only half an hour and is performed as an outpatient procedure. The incision is made inside the cheek, so there is no scar and, according to Dr Prasad, 'hardly any swelling or soreness.' One of his patients, Lee Williams, spent a year considering it, before ultimately going under the scalpel, and for her, it's all about attaining more of a cherubic grin. 'I . just want someone to perk me up a little bit, make me a little cuter, a . little more of a remember-able smile,' she says. And sure enough, a . quick snip and a few stitches later - she is the proud owner of set of . unmistakable dimples. It's not just those pearly whites: Kate Middleton (pictured) is the proud owner of a pronounced pair of dimples, which certainly accentuate her beaming smile . Under the knife: Ms Williams says she wants the surgery to 'perk' her up, make her 'cuter' and give her a more memorable smile . From drab to fab! Ms Williams before she underwent the surgery (left) and three days later (right) displaying no swelling or redness . The process involves first marking with a pen where her natural dimples would be, by measuring from the corner of her eye down to her cheek. 'There's kind of a sweet spot where the skin will naturally give us permission to fold in a little bit and look more natural,' explains Dr Prasad. He points out that many of his patients with 'round faces' get the procedure done because of the more 'angular' appearance their face takes on as a result of the surgery - creating the illusion that they have lost weight. Slimming? According to Dr Prasad (another of his patients pictured), many women with 'round' faces opt to have dimpleplasty to create the illusion that they have lost weight . Dimple icons: A-Listers including Kristen Dunst (left) and Miranda Kerr (right) have spurned the trend with their admittedly adorable cheeky smiles . Naturally occurring dimples, as in the case of Jennifer Garner (left) and Leighton Meester (right) are in fact a genetically inherited defect in the cheek muscles . Dimples occur in both sexes, can be one-sided or symmetrical, and are commonly inherited as a dominant genetic trait. According to Dr Aharnov, a Californian-based dimpleplasty specialist, natural dimples are technically a flaw in the facial structure; 'formed when there is a small defect in the cheek musculature.' Still, for the likes of Kate Middleton, Jennifer Garner and Miranda Kerr, to name a few, dimples are part of their winning charm. Designer dimples could become designer disasters within a matter of years . But some surgeons are warning against the procedure. A spokesman for plastic surgeons Surgicare stated two years ago: 'As the skin ages and loses elasticity, there is no telling how the scars will look as the face begins to droop. 'Designer dimples could become designer disasters within a matter of years.' Which spells bad news for anyone who wishes to change their mind; as this latest celebrity-inspired trend in plastic surgery is not reversible.","Lee Williams, a patient in New York, opted for the surgery to make her 'a little cuter'

Experts say the scanner could kickstart the popularity of home 3D printers. ‘Right now, a large obstacle to 3D printing adoption is the difficulty in producing the digital 3D models required,’ said Roger Chang, CEO, Pirate 3D, a 3D printing firm. When you take a picture on a conventional 3D mobile phone or digital camera you are using a technique known as stereoscopic imaging.This uses two camera viewpoints, one for each eye, to display a ‘3D’ image on a stereoscopic screen that gives the impression of depth.In contrast, the core technology behind Fuel3D fuses geometric and photometric stereo 3D capture - producing both the shape and exact colour.This raw capability provides the opportunity for an object to be captured in true 3D geometry and full color for any other non-medical applications. ‘A high quality affordable scanner will really change the 3D printing game and Fuel3D’s 3D scanner looks set to put 3D modelling capability into everyone’s hands.’The technology behind Fuel3D was originally developed within Oxford University and was, at first, developed for medical imaging applications.'With Fuel3D, we plan to adapt a technology that has already been proven in the medical sector to deliver a new 3D scanning option to professionals and consumers with a passion for 3D creativity,' said James Paterson, who developed the scanner.‘The unique technology that we have developed allows us to offer what is literally a point-and-shoot approach to capturing both 3D data and colour, and we are confident that no one else in the world is able to offer this kind of solution at the price that we can achieve.'

"Therapy traditionally consists of sitting on a comfortable sofa while pouring your heart out to a counsellor. But in this digital age, online therapy is just as beneficial - if not more so - than conventional therapy. According to a new study from the University of Zurich, therapy sessions carried out online have become increasingly common in recent years. Death of the therapist's couch? A new study found that online therapy is more effective than the traditional face-to-face kind . Many sites, like Breakthrough.com and California Live Visit, have created a network of therapists who use instant messages, emails and even video chats to help their patients. To investigate how effective this method was, researchers asked six therapists to treat 62 patients suffering from moderate depression. After being randomly divided into two groups, one was treated online - through email or instant messenger - while the other received face-to-face therapy. Both groups received eight sessions consisting of cognitive therapy techniques. Speaking about the results, Professor Andreas Maercker said: 'In both groups, the depression values fell significantly.' Online treatment: Researchers put its success down, in part, to the paper trail it generates. Fifty-three per cent of those treated online were no longer diagnosed with depression, compared to 50 per cent of those who had face-to-face therapy. During follow-up sessions, it was found that rates of recovery among those treated online were higher than the patients who saw counsellors in person. At the end of the study, 57 per cent of patients who underwent online treatment were free of depression, compared to 42 per cent of those who had traditional therapy. Researchers put the online success down, in part, to the paper trail it generated. Patients were able to re-read the correspondence with their therapist, keeping it fresh in their mind, whereas those who had real-life therapy quickly forgot advice given. Maercker added: 'In the medium term, online psychotherapy yields even better results. 'Our study is evidence that psychotherapeutic services on the internet are an effective supplement to therapeutic care.'","University of Zurich found virtual therapy more successful than face-to-face sessions .

"A new type of solar cloud has been discovered emanating from the sun. The magnetic cloud is a smaller version of larger clouds of particles known as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which can produce auroras on Earth. And the finding could apparently help us understand how such space weather affects our planet. Dr Janvier from the University of Dundee has discovered a new solar cloud. Solar clouds are groups of particles emitted by the sun into space, often as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), shown. This latest finding is smaller than comparable CMEs. But she says it could help us understand how space weather affects Earth . The discovery was made by Dr Miho Janvier from the University of Dundee together with Pascal Démoulin of the LESIA Observatoire de Paris in France, and Sergio Dasso at the University of Buenos Aires. She made the discovery while looking at matter expelled from the sun and thrown out into space. 'Our work has been studying how solar flares are generated and the effects they cause,' explained Dr Janvier, reports the BBC. 'We already knew there were these large magnetic clouds generated by solar flares. 'We also knew that smaller magnetised structures existed, but what we have found is that they have a completely different origin. The earth's magnetic field could flip in just 100 years, researchers have found. The move, which would mean all compasses pointed south instead of north, was thought to take thousands of years. However, a new study found it can happen far faster. The new study by a team of scientists from Italy, France, Columbia University and the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrates that the last magnetic reversal 786,000 years ago actually happened very quickly, in less than 100 years - roughly a human lifetime. The discovery comes as new evidence indicates that the intensity of Earth's magnetic field is decreasing 10 times faster than normal, leading some geophysicists to predict a reversal within a few thousand years. 'These smaller clouds have different characteristics which mean they must be generated in a different place and/or in a different way. 'They must be coming from the sun but we are not sure yet where in the sun's atmosphere they are being born.' She explained to MailOnline the finding is comparable to hurricanes and regular storms on Earth. In this instance coronal mass ejections are much larger clouds of particles, whereas these new 'flux ropes' are much smaller. Their size can be one tenth the Earth-sun distance, but they are thought to be much more numerous on the sun than larger coronal mass ejections. But she adds: 'We didn't just see one cloud, it was a population of smaller clouds.' Solar clouds are storms of energised particles sent across the solar system at speeds of up to 370 miles (600 kilometres) per second. When they arrive at Earth they can cause geomagnetic storms and pose a potential danger to satellites and even astronauts on the ISS. Solar clouds are storms of energised particles sent across the solar system at speeds approaching that of light. When they arrive at Earth they can cause geomagnetic storms and auroras (shown), and pose a potential danger to satellites and even astronauts on the ISS. Numerous spacecraft are in orbit around the sun to observe these events, including Nasa's twin Stereo spacecraft. The two probes observe the sun simultaneously to produce stereoscopic images and observe solar phenomena including coronal mass ejections - commonly associated with solar storms. However, the agency announced the other day that they had lost contact with Stereo B ('Behind'), putting the mission in jeopardy. 'Communications with the Stereo Behind spacecraft were interrupted on 1 October, immediately after a planned reset of the spacecraft performed as part of a test of solar conjunction operations,' Nasa said. 'The cause of the anomaly is not yet known, though a sensor anomaly in the guidance and control system is suspected. Attempts to recover the spacecraft are continuing.' The latest findings, though, will be useful for other spacecraft including the sun, such as a planned probe by Esa in 2017. The discovery comes as one of Nasa's twin sun-observing Stereo spacecraft failed (illustration shown). The two probes observe the sun simultaneously to produce stereoscopic images and observe solar phenomena including coronal mass ejections - commonly associated with solar storms .","University of Dundee's Dr Janvier discovered a new type of solar cloud .

"A fisherman from New Zealand was left baffled when he caught this see-through shrimp-like creature swimming near the surface of the ocean. Stewart Fraser was fishing with sons Conaugh and Finn 43 miles north off the North Island's Karikari Peninsula when he spotted the translucent 'shrimp' floating near the top of the water. Mr Fraser said: 'I was in two minds whether to haul it in, but curiosity got the better of me and I decided to take a closer look. This translucent shrimp-like creature was caught swimming near the surface of the ocean off New Zealand . Baffled: Fisherman Stewart Fraser holding the see-through shrimp . 'It felt scaly and was quite firm, almost jelly like, and you couldn't see anything inside aside from this orange little blob inside it. The photo baffled Mr Fraser and all of his fisherman friends, who are still none more the wise as to what the creature could have been. One theory to explain the mysterious fish is that it could be a salpa maggiore - a kind of marine invertebrate. Salps, as they are more commonly known, are found in both equatorial and cold seas, so the waters around New Zealand's Karikari Peninsula would be more than suitable for the translucent sea creature. They are spotted swimming alone just as often as they are seen in long, string-like colonies, and move by pumping water through their gelatinous bodies. As a harmless creature that feeds only on plankton, a salp's see-through body is believed to be designed to avoid it being spotted by predators when floating near the surface. One remarkable species survival technique is the ability to create a clone of itself when food is abundant, which then grow at the fastest rate of any multicellular creature. Mr Fraser said: 'We have no idea what it could have been but it was quite something and I'd never seen anything like it before.' However, Deborah Cracknell, research lead from the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth, told MailOnline she believes the creature is a Salpa maggiore (Salpa maxima). Paul Cox, director of conservation and communication at the National Marine Aquarium, said: 'Little is known about these salps, however, they are often found in colder seas, with the most abundant concentration found in the Southern Ocean. 'The salp is barrel-shaped and moves by contracting, pumping water through its gelatinous body. 'It strains the water through its internal feeding filters, feeding on phytoplankton from the upper sunlit layer of the ocean. 'They have an interesting life-cycle with alternate generations existing as solitary individuals or groups forming long chains. 'In common with other defenceless animals that occupy open water - jellies and hydroids for example - the translucence presumably provides some protection from predation. Being see-through is a pretty good camouflage in water.'

"A pregnant Australian mother-of-two facing deportation from Yorkshire despite having a British husband has won her battle to stay in the UK. Katherine Tate, 23, was told that she must return to Australia by immigration authorities, even though her husband Dale, and children Oliver and Harrison are British citizens. But after an Immigration Tribunal ruled in their favour, the Home Office dropped its case against the family from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, saving the family from fighting a costly appeal. Scroll down for video . Dale Tate is battling to prevent his wife Katherine from being deported despite their two sons Oliver, left and Harrison, right being British citizens. The Home Office wants to send Mrs Tate back to Australia . Someone can apply for British citizenship if they are married to a UK national once they are more than 18, of sound mind and good character. Applicants need to have a knowledge of English and an understanding of life in this country. Applicants must have lived in the UK for the past three years and spent no more than 270 days outside the country during that time - including no more than 90 days in the past 12 months. Also applicants must not have broken any immigration rules. The department had previously argued Mrs Tate and her husband should have completed the required paperwork before they flew from Australia to the UK. Mr Tate, 30, who grew up in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, is angry with the Home Office's stance. He said: 'My wife is an Australian citizen, our two children are British citizens, and she is six months pregnant with our third child. 'I own an electrical contracting company and employ two tradesmen and two apprentices in turn creating jobs, skills and a contribution to our economy and welfare system. 'We claim no benefits whatsoever, no child support, no family tax credits or others alike. 'We pay our taxes and NHS stamp regularly and work hard but for some reason, the Home Office have deemed us to be unsuitable to live here in the UK and have attempted to deport my wife whilst pregnant to a country where she no longer has any support, no job, no home and no family.' Mr Tate, right, said: 'I'm not a rich man and every penny I earn is for my family. It annoys us that there are so many people claiming benefits yet we could be split up as a family' Before the Home Office's decision to back down, he spoke of his 'desperate legal battle which is costing us thousands of pounds that we should be using to look after our home and our family'. Mr Tate met his wife in Australia's Whitsunday Islands in 2010 while he was travelling and they married on October 1, 2011. They have two sons, Oliver, 3, and Harrison, 18-months, who were both born in Australia but as British citizens. Mrs Tate, right, is currently six months pregnant and has been told she cannot receive free NHS care . Mrs Tate, pictured with her two sons, moved to the UK last summer from Australia with her husband who was born in Yorkshire . Their third child, also a boy, is due in December. Mr Tate said: 'We had no problems in returning to the UK to resume our family life here last July and applied in September for all the permissions we thought we needed. 'The Home Office got very strict and insisted that Katherine leave the country within 10 days or would be forcibly removed. We instructed a lawyer and so began a very costly process. 'We finally got them to a tribunal in Manchester and the judge ruled in our favour last month. 'To make things worse, they have also instructed the NHS not to give my wife any pregnancy care or treatment without payment for these services. 'I'm not a rich man and every penny I earn is for my family. It annoys us that there are so many people here claiming benefits yet we could be split up as a family'.' Katherine Tate, left, on her wedding day with husband Dale, married in Australia in October 2011. Mrs Tate, is pictured, right, with son Harriso . Mrs Tate said: 'I'm pregnant without third child who is due in December and I've been told by the Home Office that if I need any NHS treatment I will have to pay. 'Dale was born in this country and he owns an electrical contracting company where he employs two tradesmen and apprentices. 'We don't claim any kind of benefits, or receive family tax credits, child support or anything else like that. 'But for some crazy reason the Home Office don't think we should be allowed to live here. 'We've already been through the court system where the judge actually ruled in our favour. 'Surely common sense should have prevailed but obviously that isn't going to be the case. 'It's costing us an awful lot of money and with our third child on the way it is money we can't afford. 'I'm an Australian citizen but I'm married to Dale, who is British citizen and my two boys are both British citizens too. The couple first met in Australia in 2009 before getting married in 2011. 'We applied for all permissions we thought we needed as soon as we arrived in the UK last summer. 'But after the Home Office contacted us in January this year we had no choice but to contact a lawyer and start what has become a very expensive process. 'We're absolutely devastated because we're a hard-working family who face being split up.' The Home Office claimed that the Tate family should have completed the proper paperwork before returning to the UK. Mrs Tate faces deportation even though her husband was born in Yorkshire . Colne Valley MP Jason McCartney had taken up the couple's case and wrote a letter of support for them to the tribunal. He insists the immigration system needs a rapid overhaul and needs to be simplified. 'There are hundreds of thousands of cases caught up in the backlog. The Tates are genuinely worried and we have been fighting their case since February. 'I hope we can get a decisions sooner rather than later'. A Home Office spokesperson confirmed today they would not appeal against the ruling.

"Selfies, relentless Facebook posts and an obsession with keeping up with the Kardashians may make the younger generation appear self-involved and narcissistic, but research suggests they are much more generous than first thought. A study of people born since 1982 found that the so-called 'Generation Y' is increasingly socially aware, and willing to give to good causes. More than two thirds of those questioned said they would give away up to 50 per cent of their revenue, if they had their own business. The researchers from Oxford Said Business School surveyed 2,000 professionals born since 1982. They found that 66% of so-called Generation Y are willing to donate half their income to good causes, and many said they would donate to tackle poverty and unemployment. Stock image pictured . Scots are more likely to tip for services than anyone else in Britain – with those living in the North East named the most tight-fisted. Waiters, taxi drivers, hairdressers and others can rely on a bit extra from customers north of the border but may go empty handed in other areas of the country, a survey revealed. Only 13 per cent of Scots say they never tip - the lowest proportion of any region and less than half the stingy 35 per cent of Geordies who refuse to leave a gratuity. The North East is the worst area for workers to get a bit extra from customers, said the survey of 2,000 adults by financial advice service Thinkmoney. And the two key areas of concern were tackling poverty and helping the environment. The study was commissioned for the London launch of a global competition called The Venture, which is giving away a million dollars to the best social enterprise start-ups. The researchers surveyed 2,000 professionals aged between 18 and 32. It formed part of a wider report by Oxford’s Said Business School, which found young entrepreneurs want to solve problems, mainly in their own communities. Many said they were frustrated by a lack of political solutions to problems like poverty, youth unemployment and the environment so wanted to do something about it themselves. Almost one in ten of the participants also said they have previously given up potentially lucrative professions to start such a business. The trend has been encouraged by young entrepreneurs, such as Facebook’s 30-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, who last year donated almost a $1 billion (£617 million) to charitable causes last year. This has led to the ‘rise of social entrepreneurship, the idea that economic incentives and positive social change can - and should - go hand in hand,’ Soushiant Zanganehpour from the Said Business School said. ‘Over the past two decades in particular, the phenomenon has gained significant traction, and in some cases is on the verge of mainstreaming into general business.’ Almost one in ten of the participants also said they have previously given up potentially lucrative professions to start businesses. The trend has been encouraged by young entrepreneurs, such as Facebook’s 30-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, who last year donated almost a $1 billion (£617 million) to charitable causes last year . These are businesses which are driven by a good cause, like Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant brand which provides training for disadvantaged young people. And around half of these have been created in the past 12 months, and are becoming onee of the economy’s biggest booming sectors. The Venture will see a UK winner crowned in February who will then go into the global final in Silicon Valley, next June.","The researchers surveyed 2,000 professionals born since 1982 .

"The most common surnames in Sydney have been revealed, and thanks to modern Australia's European origins the English name Smith still reigns. Lee, with both western and Asian origins was the second most prevalent, as it is common as an English, Chinese or Korean surname. Popular Vietnamese family name Nguyen, which also has roots as a Chinese name, rounded out the top three. Last year Nguyen was the 13th most popular in Australia. Smith has been ranked the most common surname in Sydney, a name Dick Smith shares with thousands of Australians . The ranking came from an analysis of the new White Pages directory, but social demographer Mark McCrindle told The Sunday Telegraph within a few decades Smith will have been toppled as the top surname. Sydney's rich multiculturalism is on display in the list, with Korean name Kim coming in fourth and Chen, Li and Wang making up the final three places in the top ten. Surnames such as Jones which ranked fifth, Williams in sixth, and seventh most popular Brown, are also among the most popular family names nation-wide. Mr McCrindle told the publication the trends emerging in Sydney often give an insight into the way the rest of Australia is headed. 'You really get a heads up on the trends by looking at the White Pages in Sydney... It really follows the patterns of settlement and Sydney is the gateway to Australia,' he said. The demographer also revealed that an insight into what were previously the most popular names in Australia could be found by opening a White Pages directory from a regional area. Last year, Australia's most popular names were Smith, Jones, Williams, Brown, Wilson, Taylor, Lee, Johnson, Anderson and White. Australian swimmer Leisel Jones (left) and comedian Andy Lee (right) also had their family names rank highly in the top ten .

"Professor Les Ebdon said undue pressure on pupils meant they were forced into the wrong courses . School leavers must ignore the ‘dreadful snobbery’ which forces them to go to study for a degree, the universities watchdog has warned. Sir Les Ebdon said too much pressure was put on pupils to get into Oxford or Cambridge, regardless of whether it is the right for them to do. He also warned that some black and minority ethnic parents in particular were too focussed on their children studying law and medicine at top universities, and missed out on places elsewhere as a result. Sir Les became the head of the Office for Fair Access in September, with a remit to improve the number of children from poor backgrounds who gain a degree. Education Secretary Michael Gove ordered the publication of ‘destination data’ on where pupils go after A Levels, and challenged schools who resign themselves to children doing badly. ‘Once you accept that a child is likely to do less well than his contemporaries, you condemn that child to fall further and further behind, to never know the satisfaction of pushing  himself beyond his limits, to be a prisoner of others’ prejudice,’ Mr Gove has warned. ‘The victim of the bigotry of low expectations.’ But Sir Les, in an interview with the Times Educational Supplement, said the focus on universities meant schools risked ignoring vocational courses and apprenticeships which could be better for pupils who should be ‘choosing the subjects in which they excel and enjoy’. He said schools should be encouraging students to take ‘the most appropriate route to realise their full potential’ and warned that society ‘really undervalues apprenticeships’. Sir Les said black and ethnic minority pupils were pressured into applying for medicine and law courses at Oxford and Cambridge, despite being over-subscribed . Sir Les added: ‘One of our problems is there's such a dreadful snobbery about whether people go to university or which university they go to. ‘I would hate to see that work through into undue pressure on schools.’ He said black and minority ethnic students are put under pressure by their parents to apply for medicine and law courses at Oxford and Cambridge, despite those courses being some of the most over-subscribed. ‘This is one of the reasons that some groups are underrepresented at some universities. We should be treating people as individuals. ‘This perceived feeling in our society that to be a doctor or lawyer is a high-status profession that black people aspire to for their children... there's nothing wrong with it, but the most important thing is that students should be encouraged to fulfil their full potential in whatever subject that is.’","Sir Les Ebdon warns parents and schools put undue pressure on children to go to university .

"Tens of thousands more teenagers received the wrong grade in GCSE English this summer than previously thought, it emerged last night. As many as 67,000 youngsters were unfairly denied a C grade due to last-minute changes to grade bands, according to research. The analysis suggests that previous claims that 10,000 pupils had been affected seriously underestimate the problem. The figures emerged amid a simmering row . over a sudden drop in GCSE results this summer – the first in the . 24-year history of the exam. Last minute changes to grade boundaries meant that many pupils missed out on a C in English . Concern has mainly focused on English, where the proportion gaining C grades or better dipped 1.5 points from 65.4 per cent last year to 63.9 per cent. Head teachers claim that pupils who took English exams in January stood a better chance of getting a good grade than those who entered in June. They believe that exam boards unfairly raised grade boundaries for exams taken in summer to prevent severe grade inflation. Now a detailed study of the impact of grade boundary movements – carried out by David Blow, headmaster of The Ashcombe School, Dorking, Surrey – suggests that tens of thousands of pupils have been affected. The analysis looked at what would have happened to pupils who sat exams in June if the January grade boundaries remained in place. It suggests that half the 133,906 candidates who received a D in English in June would have been in line for Cs had the boundaries not been moved. ‘The numbers of pupils potentially . involved could amount to many tens of thousands of candidates,’ Mr Blow . told the Times Educational Supplement. Brian Lightman, general secretary of . the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘The more feedback . we get the more serious this crisis has proved itself to be.’ The study also suggested that pupils on the border between C and D were harder hit than their higher-achieving classmates. Pupils who scraped a C in an English . language coursework unit on understanding texts and creative writing in . January would have needed to score four extra marks to achieve the same . grade in June, it emerged. Some schools experienced a significant reduction in the numbers of students achieving A* to C grades in English . However, a candidate who just scraped an A in January on the same unit would have needed no extra marks to achieve the same grade in June. Mr Lightman said the changes would have a ‘devastating effect’ on pupils just missing out on a C. ‘A C grade or above in GCSE English is the key to so many career paths,’ he said. ‘There is a massive issue here, particularly for the Government’s social mobility agenda as many of these pupils are from areas of high deprivation.’ In a series of questions and answers posted on its website, Ofqual, the standards watchdog investigating claims of unfairness, admitted some schools had seen grades vary wildly compared with teachers’ predictions. ‘Overall, GCSE English pass rates at A* to C grade fell by 1.5 per cent, but some schools appear to have experienced much more significant reductions in achievement as compared with their own teacher predictions,’ it said. It denied it had been ‘leant on by the Government’ to crack down on grade inflation. A spokesman for the exam board involved, AQA, said: ‘Grade boundaries change between exam series by different amounts at different grades. This is a normal feature of the assessment process.’",First time English grades have dropped in 24 years .
"A jobcentre adviser who smashed her car into a lamp-post after finishing a bottle of wine has been cleared of drink-driving after a judge accepted she had been sleepwalking. Becky Mason, 28, was arrested and failed a breath test after staggering from the wreck of her Peugeot 307 in her pyjamas. It later emerged that minutes earlier she had driven to work – even though it was Saturday night – where an incredulous security guard told her the office was shut for the weekend. Relieved: Becky Mason was cleared of the charges against her after it was proved that she had been fast asleep when she got in the car drunk . Now, after an extraordinary legal battle, Miss Mason has been acquitted after a court found she had been asleep the whole time and therefore couldn’t be held responsible for her actions. Unbeknown to her, it turned out she had been suffering from sleepwalking episodes for years. Her defence was backed by a leading sleep expert who has previously gone to court to debunk claims by murderers and rapists that they were asleep at the time of their crimes. On the day of the crash, Miss Mason had awoken early, because she was worrying about an appointment she had concerning voluntary work. ‘I struggle to sleep anyway, and on the day of the crash I’d been awake since 6am,’ she said. ‘Later on I had a friend round to my . home and we both had a few glasses of wine and did karaoke together.Then . the next thing I knew I was getting out of my car after crashing into a . lamp-post.’ Witnesses described the psychology graduate as appearing ‘confused’ after the crash, which she escaped with only a graze to her hand, thanks to her car’s airbags. Breath tests found 96mg of alcohol per 100ml – nearly three times the legal limit of 35mg – and she told officers she had obviously been drink-driving. But after telling solicitor Derek Millard-Smith she had no memory of getting into the car and ‘it felt like committing a crime in my sleep’, he set about investigating further. In law, sleepwalking – or automatism – is a defence against committing a criminal act as there is no conscious act of will involved. Shortly before the crash, at about 10pm on Saturday, February 11 this year, Miss Mason had arrived at the JobCentre in Knowsley, Merseyside, where she is a customer service adviser – a five-mile journey from her Liverpool home. The security guard – whose evidence was to prove crucial in the case – pointed out to the pyjama-clad Miss Mason that she wasn’t due in for another 36 hours, and she left again. Miss Mason now believes that after falling asleep on the sofa, she had been disturbed by the noise of her housemates shutting the front door as they went out, and got into her car without waking up. An expert examining the case concluded she crashed because she was actually moving into a phase of deeper sleep. He . said evidence that both Miss Mason and – she has now learnt – other . family members had previously sleepwalked supported the theory. Trigger: It is believed the noise of her housemate shutting the door disturbed her sleep and make her get up and get in her car . This week at Liverpool magistrates court, District Judge Miriam Shelvey said she was ‘satisfied that the defendant did drive while in a state of parasomnia’, or disordered sleep. Yesterday Miss Mason – originally from Mid Wales – told the Daily Mail: ‘It really hasn’t sunk in yet – it’s been the worst year of my life and I’m so relieved it’s all over. ‘I would never in a million years drink and drive; in fact I’ve always been strongly against it. ‘I had no idea I might have been sleepwalking, but the more we pieced things together, the more it made sense. A few weeks later I was due to go to Alton Towers, and I woke up at 3am and realised I’d been putting my make-up on in my sleep.’ Miss Mason – who could not get legal aid and had to fund her defence through a family inheritance – now gives a friend ‘custody’ of her car  keys when she’s asleep to prevent a repeat. Neuropsychiatrist Dr Jonathan Bird said it was the first time in 26 years specialising in sleep disorders that he had gone to court to support an account of sleepwalking. ‘Her experience is at the extreme end of parasomnia, but the evidence strongly showed that she had indeed been asleep right up until the crash,’ he told the Mail. Mr Millard-Smith, of Hill Dickinson solicitors, said he too had no doubt Miss Mason had been asleep, saying: ‘The message is not you can get away with drink-driving if you advance sleepwalking as a defence, but that the justice system does work in the event of genuine circumstances.’","Becky Mason has no memory of driving drunk whilst she was sleep walking .

"Britain is facing the threat of a spring of widespread industrial unrest at the hands of Labour’s biggest donor and the teaching unions, it has emerged. New documents suggest senior figures at Unite, which has given the Opposition more than £7.5million since Ed Miliband became leader, believe Britain’s first general strike since 1926 should be a ‘tool in our armoury’ in the fight against Government public spending restraint. And there could be further disruption in thousands of schools with teaching unions planning to escalate action. Protest: Documents suggest senior figures at Unite believe Britain's first general strike since 1926 should be a 'tool in our armoury' in the fight against Government public spending restraint . The Trades Union Congress voted in September to ‘consider the practicalities’ of a general strike, ahead of further discussion by trade unions. But now senior figures are ‘fighting to ensure that a general strike is not dropped from the agenda’, according to minutes from the December meeting of Unite’s executive council that have appeared on a website linked to the union. The document says there is ‘consensus that a general strike should be one of the tools in our armoury against cuts and austerity’. The last general strike in Britain took place in 1926, when millions refused to turn up to work for nine full days. The document adds that ‘serious campaigning’ is required to ensure that members support the move. ‘We concluded that other action, such  as coordinated action in the public sector over pay, should be in addition to rather  than in place of a move towards a General Strike,’ it says. A spokesman for Unite said: ‘These are not minutes at all – they are one person’s notes. Outrage: Education Secretary Michael Gove has infuriated unions by announcing plans to abolish automatic annual pay rises and giving heads more flexibility to set salaries according to performance . ‘On the substance, Unite voted for the resolution at the TUC last year calling for the practicalities of a general strike to be explored as a campaigning option against the Government’s austerity agenda. So did most unions, and the resolution was passed. Nothing more has happened since.’ Separately, teaching unions – which started work-to-rule action in October –are preparing to escalate their campaign of action, meaning schools across the country face disruption before Easter. Education Secretary Michael Gove has infuriated unions by announcing plans to abolish automatic annual pay rises and giving heads more flexibility to set salaries according to performance.

"The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday afternoon that Lois Lerner, who heads up the Internal Revenue Service's tax-exempt division, plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in a hearing Wednesday before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs. The Fifth Amendment provides that U.S. citizens may not be compelled to offer testimony if telling the truth would incriminate them. Lerner's defense lawyer, William W. Taylor III, wrote to the committee on Tuesday that his client would refuse to answer questions related to what she knew about the extra levels of scrutiny applied to conservative nonprofit organizations that applied for tax-exempt status beginning in 2010. Lois Lerner heads the IRS's Exempt Organizations division. Her lawyer says she will plead the Fifth Amendment on Wednesday to avoid answering questions about her agency's tea party scandal during a congressional hearing . IRS headquarters in Washington, D.C. is fast becoming the epicenter of the tea party probe, despite an Inspector General report that focused on employees in Cincinnati, Ohio . She also will decline to say why she didn’t disclose what she knew to Congress, according to the LA Times. Lerner . 'has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation,' Taylor's . letter read, 'but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take . this course.' He is asking the oversight committee to excuse Lerner from testifying, claiming that calling her in a congressional hearing would 'have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her' since members would not expect her to answer questions. Ahmad Ali, a committee spokesman, told MailOnline that 'Ms. Lerner remains under subpoena from Chairman Issa to appear at tomorrow's hearing - the Committee has a Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight.' 'Chairman [Darrel] Issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs.' The IRS applied special criteria to conservative organizations seeking tax-exempt status, putting them on a 'Be On The Lookout' (BOLO) list, based on the groups' names and political philosophies. President Barack Obama has said he was unaware of the program until May 10, when excerpts of an IRS Inspector General Report on the practice were leaked to reporters. Jay Carney, the Obama administration's designated flak-catcher, insists that the president didn't know about the IRS targeting tea party groups until he learned about it during a TV news broadcast . But Jay Carney, the president's chief spokesman, confirmed Monday that senior White House staff, including White House Counsel Kathy Ruemmler and Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, knew about the IRS's habits as early as April 24, and chose not to tell Obama. The Inspector General report found that Lerner and other IRS were notified in or before June 2011 that some staff in the agency's Cincinnati, Ohio office were using 'tea party,' 'patriots' and other key words to add applicants to the BOLO list. Once on that list, the groups were subjected to additional auditing of their financial practices, their membership and their political activities. Despite knowing about the program, Lerner and other senior IRS staffers withheld the information from Congress despite receiving several requests from House committees whose members heard from constituents that their tea party groups' tax-exempt approvals were taking as long as two years to be resolved. The House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee was among those that specifically asked the IRS whether it was inspecting tea party groups more closely than other applicants, including those on the political left. Under mounting pressure, President Barack Obama announced May 15 in the East Room of the White House that acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller would be stepping down. It emerged hours later, however, that Miller's term as acting commissioner was already scheduled to end in early June . Lerner herself launched her agency's scandal with a planted question-and-answer exchange during a May 10 American Bar Association conference. Asked the pre-arranged question, Lerner responded by conceding that her employees had acted inappropriately. 'Instead of referring to the cases as advocacy cases, they actually used case names on this list,' she told the assembled tax lawyers. 'They used names like ""tea party"" or ""Patriots,"" and they selected cases simply because the applications had those names in the title.That was wrong. That was absolutely incorrect, insensitive, and inappropriate — that’s not how we go about selecting cases for further review.' She later claimed that the increase in scrutiny of tea party groups was due to an influx of new applications from right-wing organizations, following the Supreme Court's 'Citizens United' ruling, which opened the floodgates to greater political participation by nonprofit advocacy groups. The Washington Post called that claim bogus, however, with the newspaper's fact checker awarding it a 'four Pinocchios' rating for dishonesty. FOUR PINOCCHIOS: 'Between 2010 and 2012, we started seeing a very big uptick in the number of 501(c)(4) applications we were receiving,' Lerner claimed, but the Washington Post determined that wasn't true. Lerner's boss, acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller, was relieved of his post by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew last week, although the term of his appointment to the job was already scheduled to end in early June. Other higher-ups inside the IRS have not been publicly held accountable for the improper targeting of conservative organizations.","Lois Lerner faces House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs .

"Teenagers could be given national rankings according to their scores in the new ‘O-levels’ being introduced by the Government, it emerged yesterday. Certificates for the replacements for GCSEs in the core subjects of English, maths and science would go beyond a simple grade. They are likely to include the student’s overall position as well as a graph showing the overall distribution of scores. The proposed overhaul of the exams system for 16-year-olds is to halt the ¿dumbing down¿ of exam passes . A similar system already operates for the Cambridge Pre-U qualification, where students’ certificates also provide a distribution of overall marks. Last October, Education Secretary Michael Gove suggested the controversial idea for A-level students, but unions claim ranking pupils on exam results could ‘brand’ them for life. The plan, revealed in the Times Educational Supplement, forms part of an overhaul of the exams system for 16-year-olds. Mr Gove is already proposing to allow only one board to design an exam in English, maths and science to halt the ‘dumbing down’ of exam passes. A government source said yesterday: ‘No decision has been made yet but if you look at the Pre-U, they print on the back of the certificate the distribution of all the marks so if you do maths  Pre-U, you see a distribution curve of how everyone scored. ‘What we are thinking about is, if we move to a single exam board, then there’s no reason why you couldn’t do that with new exams at 16. Michael Gove MP, Secretary of State for Education, is proposing a raft of changes to assessments for 16-year-olds to halt the trend of easier exams . ‘At the moment, all you get is a  grade score. You don’t actually know how you scored specifically in different papers and how that compares with everyone else.’ Mr Gove wants exam boards to compete for the chance to produce the new English, maths and science papers. Ministers plan to change the marking system so the new ‘O-levels’ will not be norm-referenced, meaning that top grades would not be limited to a fixed proportion of pupils. The current A to G grading system for English, maths and science is also set to be scrapped and replaced with a numerical system such as 1 to 5. ‘Otherwise it will be too confusing with all the As and Bs and (people asking) did you get an A before the change or after the change?,’ said the source. The proposals come just days after a inquiry by a committee of MPs found that exam standards have dropped because boards are competing to offer the easier papers. Nansi Ellis, of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said Mr Gove needed to ask himself whether there was any evidence that any proposed changes, ‘will benefit learning and the acquisition and development of skills’.","A similar distribution marking system is used by Cambridge Pre-U qualification .

"Nigel Thrift, of Warwick University, saw his pay rise 21 per cent to £288,000 last year . University chiefs enjoyed pay rises of up to  21 per cent last year as students struggled with  spiralling tuition fees. Vice-chancellors of the elite 24 Russell Group universities saw their salary and benefits increase by £10,175 – more than 4 per cent – to £277,000 in the year to August 2012. Their total pay packages, including pension contributions, averaged £311,000 – up from £308,000 in 2010/11. The biggest annual rise was awarded to  Warwick’s Professor Nigel Thrift, whose pay rose 21 per cent, or £50,000, to £288,000. At York, Professor Brian Cantor won a 12.5 per cent rise to £251,900 while at Bristol, Professor Eric Thomas, who is also president of Universities UK, went up 11 per cent to £282,000. Durham’s Professor Christopher Higgins saw his pay rise 10 per cent to £232,000. The highest-paid head in 2011/12 emerged as Professor David  Eastwood at Birmingham, whose pay was up  1.1 per cent to £372,000. The salary rises, uncovered in an analysis by the Times Higher Education magazine, were awarded as universities prepared to increase maximum tuition fees to £9,000 a year from September last year – up from just over £3,000. Meanwhile, lower-ranking university staff received a flat pay increase of £150. Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: ‘One rule for upstairs and another for downstairs seems to be the order of the day.’ At Durham University, Professor Christopher Higgins saw his pay rise ten per cent to £232,000 . She accused vice-chancellors of ‘hypocrisy’ over pay and pensions. ‘While staff have seen their real-terms pay fall for successive years, many vice-chancellors and principals have had their snouts firmly in the trough,’ she said. A spokesman for the Russell Group said its bosses led ‘complex multi-million-pound organisations’ that collectively contributed tens of  billions of pounds to the economy. Wendy Piatt, director-general, said that attracting the best leaders was ‘crucial if our universities are to continue to excel in a challenging economic climate’.

Traditional names such as Ruby, William and Jack, which were popular 100 years ago, have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years . With the move away from the most popular names, only 40.6 per cent of newborns in 2012 were given a name featured in the country's top 100, with this figure dropping to 39.6 per cent last year. Despite the trend, parents tend to give boys more common names compared to girls. There were 9,267 newborn boys given one of the five most popular names last year, compared to 8,239 baby girls with names from the top five most popular girls' names. The report also points to the resurgence of more traditional names, with names such a William and Jack, which were also preferred 100 years ago, with names that were common a few decades ago being pushed out. The name William ranked 2nd overall in NSW in the 1910s and has been the most popular in the state since 2009. Jack reached the 5th spot in the 1920s in NSW before declining from the 1940s to 1970s. Between 2000 and 2004 it enjoyed resurgence in popularity. In 2013, parents tried to give their newborn children original names with nearly 60 per cent picking those outside the top 100 . 1.

For girls, Ruby was popular at the turn of the 20th century and after declining from the 1950s to 1970s it has climbed steadily in popularity since the 1990s. It is currently the seventh most popular girl's name in Australia and was the second most popular last year. Boys' names entering the top 100 included Nathaniel, Parker, Jett, Seth, Louis,  Aaron, Felix and Lewis, with Callum, Andrew, Declan, Cameron, Zac, Gabriel, Christopher and Muhammad dropping out. The change in popular girls' names saw Ayla, Harriet, Penelope, Daisy, Indie, Indigo, Pippa, Nevaeh, Payton, Ariana and Elsie replace  Gabriella, Josephine, Amy, Tahlia,  Mariam, Kayla, Angelina, Elise, Lauren, Ebony and Lacy which were all pushed out of the top 100. Names jumping in popularity included Lincoln, Ryder, Hudson, Leo and George for boys, while Dylan, Hamish and Hayden all dropped significantly. The girls names jumping the most in the top 100 included Aria, which rose 26 places to 57th overall. Eloise,  Evelyn and Lillian have also become more common, while Molly dropped 19 places to 57th from 2012 to 2013. Rose, Jade and Caitlin also declined in popularity in 2013.","For the first time, Oliver is preferred name for boys .

"As far as before and after shots, go, it's a spectacular transformation. From an area of farmland to a forest of skyscrapers, Shanghai's financial district Pudong has developed at a staggering pace in the last few decades. And to prove it, two shots of the city taken 26 years apart document the explosion of construction of skyscrapers that now dominate Shanghai's futuristic skyline. The first image shows Pudong, the area to the east of Huangpu river in 1987. With patches of greenery, its farming roots ares still visible, but it is dotted with low-rise factories and offices. Small-scale: Shanghai's Pudong district (seen across the river) is an area of warehouses and factories. Some greenery from the district's farming roots remain . According to the Telegraph, the second photograph was taken last week. It shows a district of sleek, high-rise skyscrapers, each one more impressive and futuristic than its neighbour. Plans to develop the area into a 'Special Economic Zone' were launched by the Communist Party in Beijing in 1990 and 'Pudong New Area' was officially set up three years later. Now the crowded commercial hub of China and the country's first super-tall district, Pudong also boasts the world's second tallest building- Shanghai tower- which was completed on Saturday. The staggering 2,073ft tall Shanghai Tower looms high above the dozens of skyscrapers which make up China's financial capital. Science fiction fantasy: The futuristic-looking Pudong district is made up of dozens of skyscrapers, each more modern and ambitious than the last . It rises to complete a trio of towers including the adjacent Jin Mao Tower and Shanghai World Financial Center. And if this wasn't testament enough to the city's position as a world financial leader, a Chinese consortium has already expressed a desire to build the world's tallest tower - all 2,749ft of it. If construction of the planned . 220-storey 'Sky City', in Changsa, the provicincial capital of Hunan, . takes place, it would dwarf the current world's tallest building, the . 2,716ft tall Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

"Warning: Professor Carrie Paechter, of the department of educational studies at Goldsmiths, University of London . Private school girls who are under intense parental pressure to excel are being driven to eating disorders, an academic has warned. They are being treated as ‘projects’ by middle-class parents who push them too hard to achieve in music and sport as well as exams, it was claimed. But the stress of striving to be ‘perfect at everything’ can lead to anorexia, bulimia and binge-drinking, according to Professor Carrie Paechter, of Goldsmiths College, London. She warned that the pressure to succeed is particularly intense at private schools, where pupils feel they must conform to the stereotype of the straight-A pupil. Professor Paechter will next week tell the heads of top private schools’ girls they should start telling some girls they are ‘doing too much’. Girls also need a ‘hard dose of reality’ about the sexist world they face when they leave school, she will tell the annual conference of Girls’ Schools Association. Speaking ahead of the event, the academic, a professor of education, warned that girls face further pressure to fit in with their classmates and avoid being excluded by cliques. Girls who are sociable and successful may find friendships more difficult since those who are popular may not actually be well-liked, she said. Stress is also caused by leading ‘overscheduled’ lives in pursuit of perfection and a desire to ‘live up to expectations’. ‘Girls are under pressure as never before’, Professor Paechter told the Times Educational Supplement. ‘There are girls in private schools who are “projects” of their parents, learning two or three instruments to grade eight standard and excelling in sport and academia because they feel that is what is expected of them, and that is what they expect of themselves.’ Concern: Carrie Paechter, of Goldsmiths College, is worried there is too much pressure on school girls (file picture) ‘But a few of them end up in anorexia clinics complaining that their schools only cared about their results. ‘Good schools need to start saying: “You can’t do that many A levels, even if you want to.”’ ‘The schools need to start looking at girls, saying: “This is too much, you do too many things.”’ She added: ‘In middle-class families it’s not just about doing well at school, they have to be fabulous all-rounders. ‘Schools give them that message to an extent that to stand out from the crowd they must be a fantastic human being as well as doing really well at GCSEs and A levels.’ The professor also said it was important for schools to avoid turning young women who expected to have four children, a fulfilling career and a full social life. ‘If you’re being picked on that’s awful, but if you’re just ordinary you can have a decent time at school, keeping out of it’ ‘You want to keep them aspirational, but you want them to be confident enough to say, “I don’t want this”, if it is too much,’ she said. Girls also need to be warned about the ‘very serious glass ceiling they could confront,’ she added. In a separate interview, she described research into friendship groups among girls. ‘These friendship groups frequently have low tolerance for difference between group members and keep each other under constant scrutiny, excluding those who don’t make the grade,’ she said. ‘We need to be aware that it is frequently those girls who appear to be the most socially successful for whom this is a problem, and to act rapidly when problems come to our attention. These are likely to be the tip of a much larger iceberg.’ Concern: The impact of a demanding school life could drive some school girls to anorexia, it has been warned (file picture) She added: ‘There is a lot of pressure to be top of the social group, but often girls who are popular aren’t well liked - they’re feared because they’re dominant. ‘One group we studied at a school was very dominant and they kept constant surveillance on each other, checking they had their socks rolled down in the exact way and that their hair was done properly. ‘This was a very affluent school. They all had long blonde hair and highlights and all wore designer clothes outside school. There was pressure to be beautiful all the time or you were letting the group down. ‘One of the girls was whispered about because her ponytail wasn’t how it should be, and it took her all day to realise what was wrong, then she was mortified. 'The “terms” of the group can change overnight without a member realising. Girls further down the pecking order don’t notice how their socks should be. ‘If you’re being picked on that’s awful, but if you’re just ordinary you can have a decent time at school, keeping out of it.’ On its MyDaughter website, offers advice and support to parents of girls, the Girls’ Schools Association points out the ‘danger of expecting “the best” from each girl’. ‘The fall from dizzy heights of success can be a painful experience and undoubtedly it can be lonely at the top,’ it says.‘Our job is to ensure that the girls are ready and armed to cope with such challenges and the inevitable ups and downs.’","Girls are being treated as 'projects' by their middle class parents, Professor Carrie Paechter has warned .

"Members of Parliament, peers and their staff accessed pornographic websites 300,000 times over the past year, official records reveal. The total – which represents more than 820 sites a day – was released by Palace of Westminster IT bosses yesterday in response to a freedom of  information request. The figure covers ‘attempts to access websites categorised as pornography’. However parliamentary staff said it included pop-ups and was therefore not a reflection of deliberate efforts to find sexual content. Logging on: Between May 2012 and July 2013 there were almost 300,000 attempts to access pornographic websites in Parliament (file picture) All the devices monitored were linked . to the parliamentary network, which is used by MPs, peers and their . staff, between the  summers of 2012 and 2013. There . were wide variations in the monthly figures – with a staggering 114,844 . attempts to look at porn made in November, but just 15 in February. Matthew . Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This . highlights the fact that many people working in Parliament are spending . far too much time on websites that have nothing to do with their job. ‘The . internet can be a useful tool for MPs and their staff when it comes to . scrutinising government legislation. However taxpayers expect their MP . and those working in their offices to get on with their important jobs . rather than spending time surfing questionable websites.’ Dishonourable members: Parliamentary officials refused to say what their IT systems defined as pornographic . A . House of Commons spokesman insisted the records did not prove users . ‘intended’ to access pornography, and said the House of Commons would . not put in rules that could restrict attempts to ‘carry out research’. She . added: ‘We do not consider the data to provide an accurate . representation of the number of purposeful requests made by network . users due to the ways in which websites can be designed to act, react . and interact and due to the potential operation of third-party . software.’ Earlier this . year it was revealed MPs and their staff waste thousands of hours a year . tinkering with their Facebook pages, playing computer games and placing . online bets. Official records show computers on the parliamentary . estate log on to Facebook up to 3million times a month – 300 times as . often as they access the BBC News website. The . figures also revealed a high number of visits to supermarket shopping . websites, computer gaming sites and music download sites such as . Grooveshark, which is being sued for alleged copyright offences. In . March last year, for example, there were more than 83,000 visits to . Betfair’s online horseracing form guide, along with 5,461 to a betting . site for other sports that is operated by the same online bookmaker. There were 4,665 visits to bookmaker Paddy Power, 3,803 to rival Ladbrokes and 4,126 to horseracing news site attheraces.com. Several MPs also appeared to make thousands of visits to their own websites each month. And . up to 50,000 visits were made to the controversial  adultery website . Out of Town Affairs, which matches up  people looking for . ‘no-strings-attached fun, hot steamy action and erotic encounters’.

"Ebola claim: An arrest report said that Joseph Britton, 42, said he had Ebola . A courtroom was evacuated yesterday after it emerged one of the prisoners appearing in the dock had claimed to have Ebola. Joseph Britton, a 42-year-old accused of battery and disorderly conduct, told officers arresting him Thursday night that he had the deadly disease - despite showing none of the symptoms. They did not take the claims seriously and took him into court as usual - but when the arrest report was read out, the judge panicked and ordered all the other inmates out of the room. The claims emerged when an arrest report was read out in court. They came after Britoon had got to a waterfront bar, tried to smoke but was told he couldn't. He then became angry. In the document, a police officer wrote: 'William [Clark, a bar manager] confronted Joseph, who continued to smoke on the fuel docks... He also got right up close to William. 'Williams felt threatened by Joseph and asked him to leave the proeprty. Joseph kept telling William to 'f*** off'. 'Joseph then started to lick his own hand and stated 'I've got Ebola' and began to wipe his saliva-soaked hand on William. He did this several times. Joseph then left the property.' Judge John Hurley, who was conducting bond hearings via video-link, was recorded by the Sun Sentinel saying: 'I dunno. What do we do...? 'This gentleman has claimed he has Ebola... I believe you should clear the courtroom of all the prisoners.' Fire crews and a hazmat team then descended on the courtroom, locking down the jail for four hours. 'What do we do?' Judge John Hurley (left) was recorded conferring with his deputy before ordering 91 prisoners (pictured) out of the courtroom . On his own: Britton was then left in the courtroom by himself. Emergency crews in protective gear then rushed him to hospital, where he was given the all-clear . Officials later confirmed that Britton had no signs of Ebola, and the court, in Broward County, Florida, resumed. He had also been screened when he was first taken to jail. Britton was taken out of the courtroom to a medical center in Fort Lauderdale, where doctors gave him the all-clear. He licked his hand then wiped it down a bar employee, who had angered him by telling him he couldn't smoke explosive gas tanks, the report said. Had the disease been real, as many as 250 people could have come into contact with him since the arrest, a prison official said. Response: Hazmat crews descended on the Broward County jail after the false Ebola claim . Lockdown: Hazmat teams spent four hours securing the jail before it was announced that the Ebola claims were definitely untrue . 'Dress rehearsal': The Sheriff for Broward County said the false alarm was a good test for his staff . He was waiting in the courtroom with 91 other arrestees when the evacuation was ordered. Britton was held in an isolate cell while the rest of the prisoners were kept away. Scott Israel, the Sheriff for Broward County, said law enforcement were considering the false alarm a 'dress rehearsal'. He added that no sheriffs flagged the Ebola possibility because it is 'not their job' to examine arrest reports. Britton later said he did not claim he had Ebola and that the report was based on a misunderstanding.","Joseph Britton, 42, claimed to have deadly disease when arrested Thursday .

"A sheriff's deputy who dragged a mentally incompetent woman through a courthouse hallway by the shackles around her ankles is under investigation. Attorney Bill Gelin recorded the deputy dragging 28-year-old Dasyl Jeanette Rios down a third-floor hallway Monday morning in Broward County, Florida. Broward Sheriff Scott Israel questioned the conduct of Deputy Christopher Johnson and said the agency's internal affairs unit would investigate his behavior. Scroll down for video . Dragged: Dasyl Rios, 28, was taken down a hallway with her ankle shackles by Deputy Christopher Johnson . Pleading: The Broward County deputy began dragging the woman after she wanted to talk to her mother following a court appearance . Screaming: The woman was found mentally incompetent to stand trial right before she was dragged away yelling that she was being hurt and didn't want to go get beat up . Johnson, who has been with the force for 27 years, has now been reassigned to desk duty and will have no contact with inmates during the investigation, according to Local 10. 'My only concern is that the deputy might have had other options,'  Israel said. 'He could've gone through a different course and performed it a different way,' Israel said. The woman sobbed and pleaded with the deputy during the ordeal.. 'You're hurting me. You're (expletive) hurting me. Stop. You don't give nobody a chance,' she said while being dragged. She had just been found mentally incompetent to face trial in a probation violation case, and wanted to speak with her mother after appearing in court. 'All I wanted to do was sob for a few, cry. That's all wanted to do was cry for a few minutes because my life is in your hands,' she said. 'I'm not going back to get beat up,' Rios said repeatedly. Surrounded by officers and bailiffs, she tried to hang on to a nearby signpost before being dragged away from the court. Officials say Rios, had argued with a female deputy when Johnson came up to her when she was sitting on a bench. Rios's mother Sylvia was gathering up her things when she heard a noise from the hallway and watched as her daughter was dragged away screaming, according to the New York Daily News. 'I realized they were doing something to my child... I don't think I'm ever going to get over this,' the mother, an assistant principal at a local high school, said. Johnson wrote in his report 'Fearing she would cause a commotion in the public area, I then physically grabbed inmate Rios by her leg restraints and pulled her back to the D10-door.' Investigation: Deputy Johnson has been assigned to desk duty while his conduct towards Rios (pictured) is being reviewed . That would have meant dragging her down three hallways, according to the Sun Sentinel. A supplemental report said that Rios twice refused to walk. Gelin captured the incident, which drew a crowd of around 50 people, on video. 'They could have had a wheelchair, they could have had a stretcher, they could have had somebody with just the slightest bit of compassion,' the lawyer said. Mr Gelin's wife, Chief Assistant Public Defender Lynn Desanti heard the inmate's cries when she was walking in the courthouse. 'I could hear screaming, and I could see a deputy yelling at somebody, and all I could hear was, 'If you don't get up, I'm going to drag you,''' she told WSVN. She said the officer should be arrested for dragging the woman. Rios is now at a mental health hospital. Her mother says that they will think about what to do next after making sure she is OK. The incident follows another videotaped interaction with police in Broward County, where Fort Lauderdale Officer Victor Ramirez pushed and slapped a homeless man before arresting him. Compassion: Both Broward Sheriff Scott Israel and bystander Bill Gelin said there must have been another way to take Rios (pictured) away from the courthouse .","Deputy Christopher Johnson filmed dragging Dasyl Rios, 28, in Florida .

The patient's concerned family hid secret surveillance cameras around the man's room at a specialist hospital for treatment of neurological disorders. Investigation: Police have questioned two nurses at The Priory Highbank Hospital in Bury, Manchester, over allegations of abuse . It is alleged that the patient, who is believed to have suffered  was attacked while lying in bed and the CCTV footage has now been handed over to police. Staff at The Priory Highbank Hospital in Bury, Greater Manchester, have now been questioned by police over the alleged abuse of the patient. A source told The Sun: 'It’s appalling. The poor lad can’t defend himself.' The nurses are both suspended while an investigation is carried out into the alleged incident. A Priory Group spokesman said: 'Early stages of the investigation suggest that whilst the incidents need to be taken very seriously, the issues are not systemic.'","Alleged victim a patient at The Priory Highbank Hospital in Bury, Greater Manchester ."
"A teenage boy has been stripped naked and chained to a lamppost after allegedly trying to mug a pedestrian in Brazil. The youngster, believed to be aged between 16 and 18, was ambushed by vigilantes in Flamengo in Rio de Janeiro. He was stripped of his clothing, before being shackled by his neck to the lamppost with a bicycle lock. On display: This teenage boy was stripped naked and chained to a lamppost after allegedly trying to mug a pedestrian in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The boy, who was also stabbed in the ear, is believed to have tried to mug a pedestrian in the street in the minutes leading up to the attack. However, he was allegedly spotted by three men, who decided to make him pay by stealing his clothes and tying him up. He was eventually saved after passerby Yvonne Bezerra de Melo, a local teacher and founder of the educational project, UerÍ, called the emergency services. She told Rio-based newspaper O .

"Lord Robert Winston has accused the BBC of failing the public by dumbing down its programming and warned the corporation he may choose to make future programmes with rival broadcasters. The Labour peer, a fertility expert who presented the Bafta-winning series The Human Body, accused the BBC of underrating the ability of the public to take an interest in hard-hitting scientific material. He told viewers of a Times Educational Supplement webchat that the corporation was hampering people's ability to properly engage with issues like nuclear power and climate change by not giving them the facts. Attack: Lord Robert Winston has accused the BBC of failing to educate the public on hard hitting scientific issues like climate change and nuclear power . 'The public, first of all, are massively underrated. The public are perfectly capable of understanding really difficult issues, but if they are not given the tools for understanding it becomes a problem.' He said BBC managers had been reluctant to commission programmes he had suggested on climate change, presenting science he believed would change the 'emphasis' of the debate on the issue. 'They seem to think that they have to pursue viewing figures but actually if you get something that is interesting and well-made, people will watch it,' he added. Elsewhere in the interview, Professor Winston accuses of the BBC of dumbing down the quality of its science broadcasting in order to attract more viewers. 'One of the things that worries me is that very often now the BBC makes these programmes that they claim are inspiring about science but actually half the time the science that you watch or listen to is unintelligible,' he said. Britain’s nuclear expansion plans have been boosted after Japanese engineering giant Hitachi signed a £700 million deal that will enable it to start building the next generation of power plants. The engineering giant is buying Horizon Nuclear Power - which has the rights to build reactors at Wylfa on Anglesey, North Wales, and Oldbury in Gloucestershire - from its German owners E.ON and RWE npower. In what it described as the start of a 100-year commitment to the UK, Hitachi confirmed that it intends to progress Horizon’s plans to build between two and three new nuclear plants at each site. 'It's not very well explained and I think that that's rather shocking that our leading broadcaster has not really got that firmly under its belt.' It is not the first time that Professor Winston has criticised the BBC for shying away from pursuing serious scientific programming. In 2008 he said then-director general Mark Thompson shows a lack of 'spine' in his leadership, particularly over the resignation of BBC1 controller Peter Fincham over misleading footage of the Queen. He added at the time that the corporation's decision to shift towards entertainment and away from heavier subjects was 'a massive error of judgement' that would come back to haunt it. And last year he told the Daily Mail he was so fed up with 'the chaos and disorganisation' at the broadcaster that he was considering quitting and pitching future programme ideas to a commercial channel. He spoke of his fury over the BBC's treatment of his series Child Of Our Time, which focuses on a group of children born in 2000 and follows the influences that shape their personality as they grow up.  According to Professor Winston, producers were no longer filming — and at a crucial time when the children were reaching the brink of adolescence. ‘They have stopped filming the series, and by leaving it in the lurch as we reach the adolescent stage, it negates all we have done before,’ the peer told Mail columnist Richard Kay at the Chelsea Flower Show. ‘I have had talks with senior executive producers, but I’ve got nowhere. This hurts me emotionally. ‘It is part of the BBC’s remit to educate the public with programmes like this. It isn’t as if it is an expensive series, so any budgetary concerns seem like an excuse. And OK, it’s not The  X Factor, but it has very healthy audience figures for a programme of this kind.’","BBC are underrating the public's ability to understand issues, he says .

"Making her point: Susan Bassnett is emeritus professor of comparative literature at Warwick University . Universities are recruiting foreign students whose grasp of English is so poor they ‘wouldn’t scrape a GCSE’, according to a professor. International students are seen as ‘cash cows’ by institutions, which have colluded to cover up problems because they are dependent on the money they bring in, claims Professor Susan Bassnett. The former pro-vice chancellor of Warwick University says some academics even earn ‘tidy little sums on the side’ assisting students with ‘inadequate command of English’ to produce essays. Her comments come a month after the UK Border Agency banned London Metropolitan University from sponsoring international students after finding a quarter of those sampled did not have permission to stay in the UK. The university disputes the allegations and is mounting a legal challenge. But Professor Bassnett, the emeritus professor of comparative literature at Warwick, suggested the scandal was only the tip of the iceberg and London Met had ‘been made the scapegoat’ for a much wider problem. In comparison: While British students pay up to £9,000 a year in tuition fees, foreign students on the same course can be charged up to £20,000 . While British students pay up to £9,000 a year in tuition fees, foreign students on the same course can be charged up to £20,000. Professor Bassnett, who has also been an external examiner for the University of Limerick, said she had often marked scripts from foreign students with little grasp of English. 'I am not the only academic to have acted as an external examiner, assessor or auditor in the sector and to have seen scripts in English so poor that the students wouldn’t scrape a GCSE' Professor Susan Bassnett . ‘We have all seen the way in which international students with poor qualifications have been recruited as cash cows for years now,’ she wrote in the Times Higher Education magazine. ‘I am not the only academic to have acted as an external examiner, assessor or auditor in the sector and to have seen scripts in English so poor that the students wouldn’t scrape a GCSE.’ Students from outside the EU must take English ability tests but Professor Bassnett said pressure to boost student numbers meant strict selection criteria were not always observed. ‘Universities have colluded with this situation for years and successive governments have turned a blind eye because it has enabled them to continue to cut higher education funding,’ she said. A Warwick University spokesman said last night that applicants needed ‘exceedingly high qualifications’, regardless of where they come from.","'Universities cover up problems as they need cash'

"Denmark is scrapping its tax on foods that are high in saturated fat after it emerged people were travelling across the border to Germany in search of unhealthy snacks for less. Believed to be the world's first so-called 'fat tax, the levy was introduced in October 2011 in an attempt to limit the population's intake of fatty foods. Foods containing more than 2.3 per cent . saturated fat were . subject to the surcharge,  including dairy produce, meat and processed foods. Free to eat fat: Denmark is scrapping its tax on fatty food after it emerged people were travelling across the border to buy unhealthy snacks for less. The Danish tax ministry said it was also cancelling its plans to introduce a tax on sugar . The measure added 16 kroner ($2.70; . £1.50) per kg (2.2lb) of saturated fats in a product. This increased the . price of a 250g pack of butter by 2.20 kroner. Ole Linnet Juul, food director at . Denmark's Confederation of Industries, announced at the time the tax . would increase the price of a burger by around nine pence (14 cents). The price of a small package of butter increased by around 25 pence (40 cents). But the Danish tax ministry said one of the effects of . the fat tax was that some Danes had begun crossing the border into . Germany to stock up on food there, reported the Washington Post. The tax was approved by a large . majority in a parliament in 2011 as a move to help increase the average . life expectancy of Danes. But little than a year later it is being scrapped as authorities say it has inflated food prices. Authorities have now said that the tax has had adverse effects on the economy, inflating food charges and putting Danish jobs at risk. The Danish Food Workers Union recently said that the levy had led to a loss of 1,300 retail and manufacturing jobs there. The ministry said it was also cancelling its plans to introduce a tax on sugar. According to the Danish National Health and Medicines Authority, 47 percent of Danes are overweight and 13 percent are obese. Once the tax is scrapped several supermarkets have reportedly said they will reduce their prices. Denmark, like some other European countries, already had higher fees on sugar, chocolates and soft drinks. Weighty matter: According to the Danish National Health and Medicines Authority, 47 per cent of Danes are overweight and 13 percent are obese . At the time it was introduced the conservative Danish government planned the fat tax as part of a goal to increase the average life expectancy of Danes, currently below the OECD average at 79 years, by three years over the next 10 years. 'Higher fees on sugar, fat and tobacco is an important step on the way toward a higher average life expectancy in Denmark,' health minister Jakob Axel Nielsen said when he introduced the idea in 2009, because 'saturated fats can cause cardiovascular disease and cancer.' At the time the tax was introduced, some scientists said that targeting fat was the wrong attack and  that salt, sugar and refined carbohydrates can be more harmful to health. Senators in France last week called for a tax on foods containing palm oil. The UK is weighing up introducing a fat tax and Israel is also thinking of implementing one. Hungary implemented a tax on fatty foods, plus higher tariffs on soda and alcohol last year - the profits are ploughed into health care costs.","The tax was approved by a large majority in a parliament in 2011 as a move to help increase the average life expectancy of Danes .

"It is believed to be the first stealth drone capable of operating in the water. This 35 foot long boat is designed to invisibly glide across the ocean acting as a spy and spotting pirates. The daunting vessel belongs to the world’s first fleet of remote-controlled ‘robo-boats’ designed to take on dangerous covert missions without endangering the lives of crew. There are currently unmanned vessels at sea in the form of drones, small craft that are used for military operations and more recently for survey work. For instance, the Eclipse unmanned surveillance vessels (pictured) are invisible to radar and can operate 24 hours a day . They are 35ft long and can operate for 24 hours a day. They can travel at 60mph and have a range of 600 nautical miles. They are able to loiter at low speeds for 10 days without needing to refuel. The drones are powered by two 500 horsepower water jets and boast £650,000 giroscopic HD cameras. They can be decked out with a high powered fire hose, a cannon that fires nets to foul propellers and a 50 calibre gun. They use infrared cameras to see in the dark and they can identify chemical matter and underwater mines. The most expensive model costs £2 million. They are remote controlled so can operate without a crew. Looking like a cross between a miniature warship and a stealth bomber, they are the waterborne equivalent of the unmanned drone planes used by the UK and U.S. military in the fight against terror. The Eclipse unmanned surveillance vessels are invisible to radar, can operate 24 hours a day, travel at 60mph and can be kitted out with enough weaponry to blow adversaries out of the water. The cutting edge boats boast state-of-the-art technology that allows it to undertake search and rescue missions or patrol dangerous waters without requiring crew.

They can see in the dark thanks to infrared cameras and can also identify radiological and chemical matter, detect underwater mines and profile the sea bed. As well as the 35ft Oscar model, the fleet features a 3-metre jet-ski style boat called the Sea Serpent that can be deployed from another boat and a 35ft semi-inflatable powerboat named Bravo capable of operating with crew or unmanned. The price tag starts at £260,000 for a basic Sea Serpent - and goes up to a whopping £2 million for the basic Oscar boat. The boats can operate by remote control and can also be programmed to carry out missions entirely on their own.

"Men’s and women’s brains really are different. Researchers say that if both sexes had access to the same levels of education, they’d expect women to do best on tests of memory – and men to excel at maths. The prediction comes after an analysis of how the sexes’ abilities varied across Europe across time. More than 31,000 men and women aged 50-plus from 13 countries were put through three tests of brainpower. In northern Europe, women in their 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s outperformed men in the memory test (File photo) The test of numeracy involved being given five questions, such as working out how much a cut-price car would have cost when new, while the memory test involved trying to remember a list of ten words. The third test was of ‘verbal fluency’ – and involved naming as many different animals as possible in a minute. In northern Europe, women in their 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s consistently outperformed the men in the memory test. However, in southern Europe, where economic conditions were poorer for longer, the earliest born women did worse than the men. However, as education and living conditions improved, so did their performance and those born from around 1940 onwards beat their male counterparts. Men came out top in the maths tests in all countries at all ages. The researchers said the patterns mean that if men and women had equal access to education, females should do better than men (File photo) However, the gap narrowed as conditions improved, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. The researchers, from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, said that women may benefit more than men from improvements in lifestyle because they were at a greater disadvantage to begin with. They said the patterns mean that if men and women had equal access to education, females should do better than men. Men should still to slightly better than maths – and the sexes should do equally well in quick fire tests of vocabulary. It is thought the differing strengths can be explained by differences in the biology of the brain as well as in the way the sexes are treated by society.","Researchers say that if both sexes had access to same levels of education women would do best on memory – and men at maths .

"Cynthia Hall, headmistress of Wycombe Abbey School, fears some of her most talented pupils could miss out on places at universities because they have been unfairly denied A*s . The exams regulator today said it will look again at GCSE gradings amid claims that thousands of students have been treated unfairly. Ofqual admitted there were 'questions about how grade boundaries were set in a very small number of units across the year'. The move comes amid threats of legal action from local authorities and teachers. It was revealed this week that the proportion of GCSEs - taken by pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - awarded an A*-C grade had fallen for the first time in 24 years. In a letter to the National Association of Head Teachers, Ofqual chief regulator Glenys Stacey wrote: 'We recognise the continuing concerns among students, parents and teachers about this year’s GCSE English results. 'We will look closely at how the results were arrived at. We will do this quickly, but thoroughly, so that we ensure confidence is maintained in our examinations system.' Ms Stacey said she expected to gather evidence over the next week and that Ofqual would then meet awarding bodies to discuss its findings. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: 'We welcome this move'. Headteachers yesterday demanded the remarking of hundreds of thousands of GCSE papers and threatened exam boards with legal action amid an escalating ‘grade-fixing’ scandal. In a furious letter to Education Secretary Michael Gove, they called for an urgent inquiry into the ‘manifest unfairness’ of ‘appalling’ marking in this summer’s GCSE English exams. The National Association of Head Teachers, representing 28,500 heads and deputies, called for all English exams sat in the summer to be regraded against more lenient criteria used for papers taken earlier in the year. Under fire: Education Secretary Michael Gove has received a furious open letter from headteachers calling for an urgent inquiry into the 'manifest unfairness' of 'appalling' marking in this summer's GCSE English exams . A second union, the Association of . School and College Leaders, which has more than 17,000 members, echoed . calls for an independent inquiry and revealed it was considering legal . action against exam boards on the grounds that ethnic minority pupils . and those from poor homes are likely to have been hit hardest by the . fiasco. Private school . heads joined the outcry, including the headmistress of this year’s top . school for A-levels, who warned that results in GCSE English appear to . have been ‘artificially depressed’. Cynthia Hall, head of £31,950-a-year . Wycombe Abbey School, fears that some of her most talented pupils could . miss out on places at leading universities because they have been . unfairly denied A*s. The . man who investigated a similar grading scandal in 2002 added his voice . to calls for an independent inquiry and encouraged examiners with . knowledge of what happened to blow the whistle. Sir Mike Tomlinson’s inquiry into the deliberate downgrading of A-levels led to nearly 2,000 grades being changed. Top of the class: Twins Jenny and Carrie Soderman are celebrating after achieving 11 A*s each . He . told the Mail the problems with English GCSE had ‘all the similarities’ with the A-level fiasco a decade ago, which ultimately led to the . resignation of the then Education Secretary Estelle Morris. ‘Someone . needs to look at it because I suspect that there will be a growing . dissatisfaction with the system. Sooner or later that has to be . diffused,’ he told the Mail. ‘I don’t know what the best mechanism is but something needs to be done to reassure students and teachers one way or the other.’ He added: ‘Teachers have said it’s changed, the boards have got to say it hasn’t or the papers were more difficult or whatever.’ If . an examiner has felt there had been pressure to change the grade . boundaries, ‘someone has to squeal and say “we were leaned on”'. The . mounting furore will pile pressure on Education Secretary Michael Gove, . who has been accused of exerting political pressure over results, as . well as exam boards and the standards watchdog Ofqual. The . row follows the first fall in 24 years in the number of A* to C grades . awarded at GCSE, from 69.8 per cent to 69.4 per cent. English results . fell 1.5 points to 63.9 per cent, and English literature 2.1 points to . 76.3 per cent. Ofqual had issued a directive to exam boards to do more to contain grade inflation. Jumping for joy: Katie Julian, Katie Pearson, Genna Hancock and Claire Petty from the Plymouth High School for Girls enjoy the moment after receiving their results . Concern . is centred around English because changes to syllabuses this year . presented boards with a tougher challenge maintaining standards on last . year. They appear to have . set grade boundaries too low for papers taken earlier in the two-year . course – effectively resulting in too many students getting good grades – . and took corrective action this summer to avoid significant grade . inflation. This involved . raising grade boundaries for exams taken in June. Pupils who took one . task set by the AQA board in January needed 54 per cent of the marks to . get a C but had to get 66 per cent for a similar assignment taken in . June. Heads claim it is . unfair because pupils taking exams at earlier sittings will have been at . a distinct advantage over those who took their final exams in June. They . also say that ‘changing the goalposts’ means that pupils who believed . they were on course for good grades in the summer inexplicably dipped. 'Shambles': Russell Hobby, General Secretary of the National Association of Head teachers, said it was not fair to discriminate against pupils because they sat their exam in June rather than January . Russell . Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT, branded the problems a . ‘shambles’, adding: ‘It is simply not fair to damage the opportunities . of young people in this way, discriminating against them purely because . they sat their exam in June rather than January. ‘Not . only does it offend natural justice, this manifestly inconsistent mark . scheme risks putting question marks over the grades achieved in January, . too. Parents are up in arms at what they see as the denigration of . their child's hard work and effort. ‘As such, we are calling for an independent inquiry as to how this situation has been allowed to happen. ‘We . are also asking for all papers from June to be remarked using January’s . criteria, thereby ensuring young people are not adversely penalised by . this unfair and illogical system.’ Meanwhile . the ASCL is backing an investigation started by England’s largest . academy chain into the backgrounds of pupils denied grades vital to . their future lives by exam board decisions, the Times Educational . Supplement reported. Brian . Lightman, ASCL general secretary, said: ‘We suspect the very ad hoc . decision that was made to lift the grade boundaries has . disproportionately affected certain groups of students and so we think . it is very worthwhile to examine this further and gather evidence. ‘If we are advised that legal action is the right way to challenge this, then that is what we will do.’ Legal . action over the controversy is also being mooted by individual schools . and local authorities including Bradford and Leeds. But . this is the first suggestion that it could focus on alleged . discrimination against the already disadvantaged - an outcome that could . be deeply embarrassing for ministers who have pledged to improve the . education of under-privileged pupils.

"Thousands of GCSE pupils had their English results downgraded only two weeks before they were due to be published, it emerged last night. They went from a C to a D after a last-minute request from exam regulator Ofqual on August 7 to board Edexcel. Ofqual had intervened just a fortnight before the publication of this summer’s results, to curtail grade inflation. Scroll down for video . Thousands of GCSE pupils had their English results downgraded only two weeks before they were due to be published . Around 24,000 students sat the paper and it is estimated that between 15 to 20 per cent of those – nearly 5,000 pupils – were on the crucial C/D boundary and may have been affected by the belated decision to raise the standard required for a C grade. The revelation will pile more pressure on Education Secretary Michael Gove – accused of washing his hands of ‘all responsibility’ in the grading row. Meanwhile teachers called for Ofqual’s chief regulator, Glenys Stacey, who appears before the Commons education select committee today, to quit. The English grading row erupted on . August 23, as furious teachers claimed thousands taking exams with . various boards had unfairly missed out on Cs. Ofqual had found that English GCSEs set in January – taken by more than 58,000 pupils – were ‘graded generously’. Test: The revelation will pile more pressure on Education Secretary Michael Gove . Now letters between Ofqual and exam board Edexcel, seen by the Times Educational Supplement, reveal summer grading decisions were overruled at the 11th hour. Ofqual’s director of standards, Dennis Opposs, wrote to Edexcel on August 7, concerned that the board was about to award results for GCSE English that would see the proportion of pupils with grade Cs rise eight percentage points above the statistical prediction. He called on the board to act ‘quickly’ and ‘produce outcomes that are much closer to the predictions’. He said: ‘This may require you to move grade boundary marks further than might normally be required.’ Edexcel replied the following day, stating that it had considered the issues raised by Ofqual but still felt its proposed grades were ‘fair’. However, the letter added that if  Ofqual still required a change, the board could move the minimum requirement for a C grade in one of the GCSE English units up to 65 marks out of 96 – up ten from January’s 55-mark grade boundary. In Ofqual’s August 9 reply, Mr Opposs stated that the board was obliged to ensure its results were consistent with others that were close enough to predictions. The letter also suggested the 65-mark boundary would actually be tougher than required. But Edexcel’s website shows that, in the end, it was adopted. Questions will now be raised about whether Ofqual also intervened with other boards’ results.The TES is publishing the full letters online today. John Townsley, a former Ofqual board member and a head who believes his pupils’ English GCSEs were unfairly graded, accused Ofqual of ‘bullying’ exam boards. The executive principal of the Morley and Farnley academies, in Leeds, said:  ‘The content of these letters is startling and makes absolutely clear that Ofqual itself has been at the centre of this disgraceful episode. ‘Glenys Stacey’s position is untenable and she should resign with immediate effect.’ An Ofqual spokesman said its correspondence with Edexcel was ‘entirely proper’ and the board ‘made the final decision’. An Edexcel spokesman said: ‘Our final award, which we believe was fair to all learners, followed specific requests from Ofqual to help them [maintain standards].’ The row intensified last night when it emerged hundreds of pupils in Wales – which holds devolved education powers – are expected to receive higher GCSE English grades after the education minister demanded their papers were regraded by board WJEC. Leighton Andrews said Welsh pupils had been victims of an ‘injustice’. Ministers in England have refused to intervene.","Grades went from a C to a D after a last-minute request from exam regulator Ofqual .

There, she was given the news that every mother dreads – that it was her son James who had gone missing in the water. The 40-year-old civil servant said she hoped his death would act as a warning to youngsters who think they are ‘invincible’ not to cool off in open water. Speaking from her home in Colne, she told how she had left James to spend the sunny evening with his friends. After watching the ‘commotion unfold’, she tried to phone him but received no answer. Unknown to her, he had disappeared underwater after trying to swim from the raft to the shore. Police divers recovered his body ten hours later after searching through the night. A 17-year-old boy who drowned while sailing with friends has been named locally as James Goodship . Idyllic: The tragedy took place at Burwain Sailing Club near Colne in Lancashire yesterday afternoon . Friends of James Goodship gather at the reservoir to pay their respects. People living in the area have described the death as 'heartbreaking' Floral tributes have been left at the scene where James Goodship drowned while sailing with friends . Miss . Goodship said: ‘Not for one minute had we known what had happened until . we saw a couple of his friends who were asking if we’d seen another lad . and they said James had been there. ‘I . was trying to phone James – there was no answer but I was thinking, . “It’s ringing so he can’t be in the water”. 'What we didn’t know is that . they had left their phones on the side.’ She added: ‘We couldn’t have . done anything. We were too far away.’ Miss . Goodship and her partner, 41-year-old policeman Emlyn Parry, were . offered use of a kind local person’s home while they waited for news. James’s body was found at 5.40am yesterday. Miss Goodship said her son . was an experienced swimmer but she had warned him about reports of . people dying in cold, open water. The body of a teenager who got into difficulties in a reservoir has been found by police today . Tragic: A note which has been taped to a post reads: 'To James, RIP pal.

"Environment Secretary Owen Paterson claimed the benefits of GM crops went beyond the food chain . A PR campaign to change the image of genetically modified food is to be launched by the government. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson wants farmers, scientists and ministers to increase the appeal of so-called Frankenstein Foods among the public. In a speech today to the Oxford Farming Conference, Mr Paterson insists there are ‘great opportunities’ in pushing GM technology , but admitted the public need reassurance that it is safe. Since last summer’s reshuffle, Mr Paterson has repeatedly backed GM’s role in keeping food supplies secure. He has dismissed complaints as ‘humbug’ and claimed ‘there isn’t a single piece of meat being served [in a typical London restaurant] where a bullock hasn’t eaten some GM feed’. GM crops were grown on 395 million acres in 29 countries in 2011, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. In today’s speech Mr Paterson said: ‘I fully appreciate the strong feelings on both sides of the debate. GM needs to be considered in its proper overall context with a balanced understanding of the risks and benefits. ‘We should not, however, be afraid of making the case to the public about the potential benefits of GM beyond the food chain, for example, significantly reducing the use of pesticides and inputs such as diesel. ‘As well as making the case at home, we also need to go through the rigorous processes that the EU has in place to ensure the safety of GM crops. ‘I believe that GM offers great opportunities but I also recognise that we owe a duty to the public to reassure them that it is a safe and beneficial innovation.’ Just too perfect? Two GM corncobs (right) are compared to non-GM corn (left) grown in Germany . Brits who got behind Team GB in the London Olympics should now back the nation's farmers, Owen Paterson said. The Environment Secretary said 22 per cent of the food that could be produced in the UK is imported. He said: 'Each year we bring in 115,000 tonnes of . ice cream – more than double the 50,000 we send abroad, 150,000 tonnes . of yoghurt – six times the 25,000 we export. British fruit and vegetable . growers are in a similar position. 'We . can all do more and, just as everyone got behind Team GB last summer, . we must get behind our food producers. 'By buying British, we boost the . rural economy and enjoy some of the best quality produce in the world.' He said the industry ‘has long been at the forefront of innovation’ and this must continue, including backing GM. But opponents of an expansion in GM technology claimed just a quarter of people thought it could be 'encouraged'. Peter Melchett, policy director of . the Soil Association, said: 'Owen Patterson says that people are eating meat from animals fed of GM feed without realising it. 'That is because the British Government has consistently opposed moves to label to give consumers accurate information, and he should put that right by immediately introducing compulsory labelling of meat and milk from animals fed on GM feed.' Friends of the Earth's senior food and farming campaigner Clare Oxborrow said: 'GM crops are not the solution to the food challenges we face. 'They are largely being developed to benefit multinational biotech firms that are gaining control of the seed industry, not to feed poor people in developing countries.' In his speech in Oxford, Mr Paterson admitted that farming had suffered a ‘tough year’ of floods, high feed costs and diseases such as bovine TB and Schmallenberg. But he said the industry in the UK produces food for 63.5 million people and supports industries that add nearly £90 billion to the UK economy. And he pledged that the government must ‘get out of people’s hair and let them get on with what they are good at’. ‘I want our farmers to be farming not form-filling,’ he said, pledging to further reduce the burden of paperwork. While demanding major reform of the EU's Commons Agriculture Policy, he defended giving public money to farmers. 'I do believe that there is a role for taxpayer’s money in compensating farmers for the work they do in enhancing the environment and providing public goods for which there is no market mechanism. 'Farming makes a real contribution to our habitats and wildlife.  We must be able to continue to develop our agri-environment schemes.'","Environment Secretary Owen Paterson says the government 'must not be afraid' of pushing genetically modified food .

"A boy of eight could have lost his fingers playing with loom bands, his father said. Brandon Lambert fell asleep with the elastic bands wrapped around two of his fingers, which turned black. Fortunately his father Mark, 36, checked on him half an hour later. Scroll down for video . A father has warned of the dangers of loom bands after his son Brandon fell asleep with several wrapped around his fingers - turning them black (pictured) Brandon pictured with sister Elise, three. His father removed the bands after finding his son asleep with them around his digits - a move that most likely saved the boy's fingers . He said: ‘I don’t usually check on . Brandon, but I am so glad I did. If the bands had stayed on his fingers . all night then he might have had to get them amputated. The circulation . had been completely cut off. ‘I took a picture quickly because I wanted to show Brandon how  dangerous they can be. He was shocked when he saw the picture.’ The . landscape gardener, who lives in Skipton, North Yorkshire, with his . wife Donna, 32, a carer, added: ‘Brandon spends up to six hours a day at . the weekend playing with loom bands, but nothing like this has happened . before. I have no idea why he likes them so much. I think it might be . because it is a craze. Loom bands are used to make bracelets like these pictured.  Numerous experts have warned the craze could be dangerous, as children could choke on the small items or cause harm to others and themselves . Kyle Lawrence, seven, may be blinded after his brother accidentally fired a loom band at his eye. He will undergo surgery in a bid to save the sight in his left eye following the accident earlier this week . The bracelets have a growing following among celebrities and sales rocketed after the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one . ‘They . are marketed as a fun and safe product but I don’t think they are. They . are like elastic bands, and elastic bands are not child-friendly. They . can be dangerous.’ Mr Lambert posted his picture on Facebook to draw attention to the danger of what had happened. One . parent replied: ‘If my friend had not posted this I would not have . checked my eight-year-old daughter and would not have found her asleep . with two fingers starting to turn blue! So a big thank you, that’s one . child you have saved!’ The . incident is the latest in a spate of injuries. The Mail reported . yesterday how seven-year-old Kyle Lawrence was blinded when a loom band . flicked into his left eye. His mother Carlie has demanded that the bands . carry a safety warning. In Bristol, an unnamed GP and mother put a photo on Facebook of her sleeping son wearing the bands and losing circulation. And . Dr Anne-Marie Houlder, a senior GP in Stafford, has urged parents to be . ‘vigilant’, warning: ‘They could be a choking hazard or cause . circulatory problems.’ Loom . bands were invented by a US father-of-two last year and have swept . playgrounds this summer. Many parents welcomed them as a return to . craft-based play. The . colourful rubber bands are woven together to make friendship bracelets . and have been worn by celebrities such as the Duchess of Cambridge and . pop stars Harry Styles and Miley Cyrus. While . a computer game can cost £40, 1,800 loom bands are as little as £2.50. They are already Amazon’s eighth best-selling toy of all time, after . classics such as the Rubik’s Cube, Monopoly and Scrabble. Headteachers, . however, are increasingly banning pupils from bringing loom bands to . school in an attempt to prevent them from causing playground squabbles . and disruption to lessons.","Father Mark Lambert, 36, went to check on his son after he'd gone to bed .

"The United States Central Command has released four new videos showing the latest attacks made by a U.S./Arab coalition against Islamic State militants. The footage, which was posted to Centcom's YouTube account, shows missiles destroying vehicles and buildings used by the terror group in both Syria and Iraq. In one clip a tank driven by the militants  is seen being destroyed, while in another a small vehicle explodes into flames having suffered a direct hit. Both attacks took place on roads in Iraq. Elsewhere a missile is filmed slamming into an ISIS-held building near the Syrian border town Al-Hasaka, and a weapons storage facility also in Syria is seen being destroyed. Before: A car driven by ISIS militants is filmed being driven along a road in Iraq . And after: Seconds later the vehicle is destroyed due to a direct hit from an American missile . Armoured: A tank belonging to the Islamic State terrorist group is seen crossing an area of grassland in Iraq . Blast: The tank explodes into flames after an American jet destroys it with a missile . Centcom has so-far released more than 20 videos of attacks against ISIS and other militant groups in the Syria and Iraq. It has also released footage of rescue and aid operations in the region. The release of the videos comes as it was claimed ISIS militants are withdrawing into smaller bases and leaving Twitter to avoid being killed by Western forces. International observers and witnesses have claimed the jihadists - whose aggressive presence on social media was until now part of their campaign of fear - appear to be turning more wary  to avoid being tracked down and destroyed. The claims were made ahead of British jets hitting another Islamic State target in Iraq yesterday, as  calls grow for the attacks to be extended into the group's strongholds in Syria. Locked on: An American fighter jet identified this building as a weapons storage facility in Syria . Taken out: Despite filming from a great height, it is clear the jet's missile destroyed the weapons facility, due to the large clouds of black smoke . Attack: In this shot a missile is seen slamming into an ISIS-held building near the Syrian border town Al-Hasaka . Hit: The explosion caused by the blast at the ISIS-held building sent a large fireball high into the air . Charles Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Centre in Qatar, said Isis appeared to have imposed a 'total social media and electronic blackout' on its own fighters. A message in Arabic, apparently banning militants from taking photographs during battle, was circulated on Twitter with the Arabic hashtag #MediaSecrecyCampaign after the British Parliament overwhelmingly voted to join U.S. air strikes. Mr Lister told The Times the message appeared to be genuine, and 'gained solid traction across the IS and pro-Islamic State camps shortly after being published'. He added: 'If it is indeed genuine, it's symbolic of the pressure that IS has been placed under in recent weeks'. British experts have run voice recognition tests on propaganda videos such as those of the 'executioner' Jihadi John, and it is thought militants want to give agents as few clues as possible as to their identity or whereabouts. Militants: ISIS terrorists control vast swaths of territory in northern Syria and western Iraq . Destroyed: People gather at the site of a car bomb attack in a Shi'ite neighbourhood in southeastern Baghdad this morning. Sunni militants loyal to ISIS are fighting against the Shi'ites . Rubble: Children gather at the site of the car bomb attack in a Shi'ite neighbourhood in southeastern Baghdad . Reports from Iraq also suggest Isis are switching to a more low-key operation on the ground - switching convoys for motorcycles, using phones less and hoisting their black flag on empty houses to confuse jet pilots. An unnamed tribal sheikh who lives near Kirkuk, northern Iraq, told the Reuters news agency Isis had 'abandoned one of their biggest headquarters' in his village. 'They took all their furniture, vehicles and weapons,' he said on the day British air strikes were approved. 'Then . they planted roadside bombs and destroyed the headquarters. 'They don't move in military convoys like before. Instead . they use motorcycles, bicycles, and if necessary, they use . camouflaged cars.' U.S. Navy Vice Admiral John Miller also acknowledged the militants had changed tack. He told ABC News on Sunday: 'They're an adaptive force, and we've seen them adapt to the airstrikes that we're doing.' Islamic State fighters beheaded seven men and three women in a Kurdish area of northern Syria, a monitoring group reports. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, among them three women, and four Syrian Arabs were beheaded near the town of Kobani. The Kurdish fighters were taken prisoner during the battle for the mainly Kurdish town, also known as Ayn Arab, which is close to the Turkish border and has been besieged by Islamic State forces. Woman fighters from the Kurdish People's Protection Units: Three women (not pictured) were among five Kurdish fighters reportedly beheaded by Islamic State militants after they were captured near Kobani . Dozens of militants and Kurdish fighters were killed in the fighting, said SOHR. Rami Abdulrahman, head of the Observatory, said a Kurdish male civilian was also beheaded. 'I don't know why they were arrested or beheaded. Only the Islamic State knows why. They want to scare people,' he said. Images posted on social media networks show women's heads placed on a cement block, said to be in the northern Syrian city of Jarablous, which is held by militants. Women fight alongside men in the Kurdish People's Protection Units, known as the YPG, which is the official armed wing of the main Kurdish political group in Syria. Kurdish forces have been locked in fierce clashes with Islamic State militants in and around Kobani since the extremist group launched an assault in mid-September. The fighting has created one of the single largest exoduses in Syria's civil war, with more than 160,000 people fleeing into Turkey, UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said yesterday. Kurdish fighters brandish their automatic rifles in Kobani: Fighting for the town has continued for several weeks, with dozens of Islamic State militants and Kurdish fighters killed in recent days alone .","Videos released by United States Central Command show attacks on ISIS .

"It's a common conception that ghosts show up in photographs. Still, it's unusual to capture the same apparition three times, from multiple angles, hundreds of metres away and in broad daylight. Spooked couple Michael and Wendy Holmes believe they caught a ghostly figure in a number of shots taken while on a day trip to a historic mountaintop castle and monastery while on holiday in Cyprus. The Holmes' were visiting the Mediterranean isle for a family wedding but it was only once they got home to England and looked at the images on screen that they noticed something was amiss. Snap: Michael and Wendy Holmes pose for a picture in front of the mountain on which the castle is built . Strange: White figure appears on viewing platform near castle where people were thrown to their deaths . A mystery white shape appears in three different photographs, all taken from separate angles, standing on a viewing platform near the eleventh century Saint Hilarion Castle far above the couple. It's an area from where traitors were said to  be thrown to their deaths from. Michael, 62, said he saw nothing unusual while they were there and insists he has not tampered with the images. Zoomed in: Up close you can make out the head, arms and legs of what looks like the outline of a human . He said: 'When I got home to England and first looked at the photos I thought it was light reflecting on one picture. 'But then I saw the same figure on three different shots, all from different angles. 'I've never believed in ghosts before, but my wife believes in the paranomal and even she is bemused about what it could be. I now believe that it's a ghost. Blissfully unaware: It wasn't until the couple got home and saw the images on screen that they noticed a body . Multiple angles: 'It definitely wasn't there when we took the picture' says Michael . 'Some people have said it's Photoshopped but I don't even have Photoshop, let alone know how to use it. 'I've got the original camera card and the pictures are still on there. 'It's just bizarre - you can see arms and legs and it definitely wasn't there when we took the picture. 'They do say that the camera picks up what the eye never can.' The mountain is 700 foot high and the castle was built during the eleventh century on top of rocky outcrops . Saint Hilarion Castle: Views across Kyrenia mountain range from the historic building are spectacular . Michael and Wendy, 51, from Buckingham, visited the castle the day after his sister Janis' wedding last month. He added: ''The castle used to be ruled by Prince John, and any traitors would be thrown to their deaths from that part of the mountain. If it is a ghost then I reckon is him. The mountain is 700 metres high with beautiful views, and it looks like the figure is on the viewing platform. 'I heard that Saint Hilarion is listed on Trip Advisor as a haunted place so it can't just be us. 'It is such a bizarre picture, and if anyone can tell me what it is, and that it isn't a ghost then please by my guest.' Saint Hilarion's Prince John Tower, where the apparition was spotted, sits on a cliff above the lower castle where there is a stunning view of the northern coast of Cyprus. The Saint Hilarion Castle lies on the Kyrenia mountain range, in northern Cyprus near Kyrenia.","Michael and Wendy Holmes only noticed the ghostly apparition once home .

"An American student has been named the world's youngest competitive eater - despite weighing just 126lbs and studying to become a dietician. Matt Stonie, 22, regularly consumes a staggering 15,000 calories per meal - six times more than the recommended daily allowance for men - at his home in San Jose, California. He eats up to 15 per cent of his bodyweight while training for competitions, including colossal portions of hotdogs, fried asparagus and frozen yoghurt. Scroll down for video . Seasoned competitor: Matt Stonie (pictured, left, breaking the world record for the number of gyros consumed in just 10 minutes) regularly consumes a staggering 15,000 calories a meal at his home in San Jose, California . In high spirits: The 22-year-old student eats up to 15 per cent of his bodyweight while training for competitions . In recent months, he has broken world records by eating 24 gyros - a Greek kebab filled with meat, roasting vegetables and tzatziki - and 12lbs of fried asparagus in just 10 minutes. But despite his incredible achievements, Mr Stonie weighs a tiny 126lbs and is studying to become a dietician, something he admits is 'fairly contradictory'. The nutrition major is now the youngest competitor on the Major League Eating circuit after competing professionally for four years. Mr Stonie, who is currently training for the world's biggest food challenge - Nathan's Hot Dog eating competition in Coney Island, New York - today described his hobby as 'hard work'. Getting stuck in: Mr Stonie is pictured (right) at a previous Nathan's Hot Dog eating competition in New York . Getting full: Despite his incredible achievements, Mr Stonie weighs a tiny 126lbs and is studying to become a dietician, something he admits is 'fairly contradictory'. Above, Mr Stonie swallows hot dogs during the contest . 'It's all about a strict diet and training regime to keep the weight off,' he said. 'When I'm competing, or even just training, I can eat nearly 10-15 per cent of my bodyweight in food and liquids, so I've had to tailor my normal diet to cope with that. Competitive eaters usually undergo rigorous training in the weeks - or months - leading up to competitions. This . involves eating colossal amounts of food over a short period of time, . as well as drinking large quantities of water to increase their stomach . capacity. Although widely popular in America, Canada and Japan, the 'sport' has been criticised for its potential health risks. Some . medics claim it can cause weight gain - leading to high cholesterol and . blood pressure - while others argue it can cause stomach paralysis, . indigestion and choking. In October 2012, a 32-year-old man choked to death while competitively consuming live cockroaches in Florida. Competitive eating has also been condemned for the message it sends to children as obesity levels soar in the U.S. and Europe. 'When I'm seriously training, I go to the gym about five times a week and have to skip meals with friends and family to stick to my schedule and keep my weight down.' Mr Stonie said he often uses the Michael . Phelps challenge to increase his stomach capacity in the weeks leading . up to competitions. The challenge involves consuming the Olympic swimmers' daily calories - a whopping 12,590 - in one sitting. Despite the seemingly impossible task, he regularly finishes of all the food - including two trays of pasta, a family-size pizza and five-egg omelette - in just over 40 minutes. Mr Stonie said his nutrition studies had helped him to balance out the side-effects of taking in so much sugar, salt and fat in such a short time, which include massive sugar crashes. 'The crashes can be really severe - like drinking too much coffee at night,' he said. 'Fortunately, sugar is usually easier to deal with digestion wise rather than fatty or high protein meals. 'I started to study nutrition to help understand how the body deals with that amount of food. 'It's fairly contradictory to be studying towards becoming a dietician, but has helped me a lot with staying healthy throughout all this eating.' Rivals: The nutrition major (left) with two other competitors at a deep fried asparagus eating competition . Since winning the first competition he . entered in 2010 - a lobster roll eating challenge with a top prize of $600 - Mr Stonie has earned $46,00, ranking him as the second best in . the world. In the last four years, he has competed all over the United States, as well as travelling to Singapore and Indonesia, as he builds up a heated rivalry with the world number one, Joey 'Jaws' Chestnut. Mr Stonie said he had first realised he . had a talent for consuming huge portions of food at the age of 18, when . he had managed to complete a 5lb burrito challenge in just 15 minutes. Dedicated to the 'sport': Mr Stonie (pictured) today described his passion for competitive eating as 'hard work' 'I . used to watch Man v Food, and think ""I could whip that guy"" so it . sparked my interest and led me to enter my 1st eating contest - lobster . roll eating,' he said. 'Amazingly, I won against a seasoned competitor, so I got addicted to everything - the competition, the adrenaline, the crowd . 'I loved everything about it and, to an 18 year old kid, starting college, getting $600 for only 10 minutes of eating was unbelievable.'","Matt Stonie, 22, from San Jose, regularly consumes 15,000 calories a meal .

"Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush claimed in remarks to religious conservatives on Friday that immigrants are 'more fertile' than American-born women, which he argued would help the economy by creating more taxpayers to pay off government debt. 'Immigrants are more fertile, and . they love families, and they have more intact families, and they bring a . younger population,' he added. 'Immigrants create an engine of economic . prosperity.' Bush, who is thought to be weighing a presidential bid, explained that a growing population of young workers could help the government fund its safety net for the retiring baby boomer generation. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush claimed in remarks to religious conservatives on Friday that immigrants are 'more fertile' than American-born women . Jeb Bush (back row, fourth from right) is seated next to his wife and extended family, including his brother and father, both former U.S. presidents . 'Demography is destiny,' he said. 'Ten years from now we will all hopefully be 10 years older. That's my plan and I hope it is yours as well. If that's the case, then we are going to have fewer workers taking care of a larger number of people that the government has a social contract with. 'We cannot do that with the fertility rates we have in our country,' he added. 'We are barely breaking even.' Bush, the brother to former president George W. Bush, is among several potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual conference in Washington. As Congress debates changing the nation's immigration laws, many conservatives are reluctant to support a new system that grants so-called 'amnesty' to millions of immigrants in the country illegally. Before being granted legal status, Bush . said, they should pay a fine, learn English and be blocked from . receiving welfare benefits. He said the nation must allow more immigrants 'to pursue their dreams in our country with a vengeance to create more opportunities for all of us.' Left: Jeb Bush and his wife Columba attend the Texas Wyoming Ball January 20, 2005 in Washington, D.C. Right: Bush and his wife attend the 2012 Lincoln Center Institute Gala . 'If we don't do it, we will be in decline,' he told evangelical Christian activists. Perhaps what Bush meant to say, as NBC points out, is that immigrants on average have more children than American-born women. According to 2011 data from the National Center for Health Statistics, the fertility rate for foreign-born women is 87.8 births per 1,000 women aged 15-44, compared to the rate of 58.9 births per 1,000 American-born women in the same age group. Also pushing conservatives to embrace . immigrants at the event Friday was Sam Rodriguez, president of the . National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. Rodriguez told the crowd, 'I know you . are hearing a lot recently about whether or not these 11 million . individuals become legal, that these are 11 million voters that . automatically vote for a democrat or a liberal. 'Don't drink the Koolaid!' he said. 'How do I know that? Because seven out of 10 individuals, that come to . Christ, that have a religious conversion experience to Christianity in . America today, our are of Hispanic descent. 'We have to put some salsa sauce on the top of the conservative movement!' Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush speaks during the Faith and Freedom Coalition Road to Majority Conference at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Washington . Bush spoke to the conference one day after holding a closed-door meeting on immigration reform with House Republicans. 'The House Republicans have a really critical role to play in this,' Bush told reporters after the meeting Thursday. 'I talked about the possibility of reframing the conversation about how economic growth matters to everybody and everybody benefits from it.' Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour backed up Bush's argument at a separate meeting at the Bipartisan Policy Center alongside the former Florida governor. 'GDP growth is simply productivity multiplied by the number of workers,' Barbour said. 'Now I wasn’t a math major, but I can figure out that if the number of workers stays the same as it has under this administration… it’s very hard to get the GDP to go up.'","Bush made the remarks  at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual conference in Washington on Friday .

"An orbiting factory that will build super-sized structures in space is being funded by Nasa. The multi-armed factory will use 3D printing and robotics to create giant space structures, such as antennas and solar arrays, that would otherwise have been impossible to launch from Earth. A demonstration of the factory, dubbed SpiderFab, could be ready by 2020, after Washington-based technology firm Tethers Unlimited (TUI) was awarded a $500,000 contract to develop the factory. The SpiderFab project is developing technologies to enable robotic spacecraft to fabricate giant . antennas, solar arrays, and telescopes in space . SpiderFab uses 3D printing and robotics to enable space systems to build and put together large components such as antennas, solar arrays, sensor masts, and shrouds on orbit. Currently, large spacecraft components are built on the ground, and are designed to fold up to fit within a rocket shroud and then deploy on orbit. But this approach is hugely expensive, and the size of these components is limited by the volume of available shrouds. ‘On orbit fabrication allows the material for these critical components to be launched in a very compact and durable form, such as spools of fibre or blocks of polymer, so they can fit into a smaller, less expensive launch vehicle,’ said Dr Rob Hoyt, TUI’s chief scientist. Spiderfab will enable space systems to be launched in a compact and durable 'embryonic' state. Once in orbit, these systems will use techniques evolved from emerging additive manufacturing and automated assembly technologies to create huge space structures . ‘Once on orbit, the SpiderFab robotic fabrication systems will process the material to create extremely large structures that are optimised for the space environment. ‘This radically different approach to building space systems will enable us to create antennas and arrays that are tens to hundreds of times larger than are possible now, providing higher power, higher bandwidth, higher resolution, and higher sensitivity for a wide range of space missions.’ Space factories would also significantly reduce the risk of launching delicate equipment on rockets, where the chance of failure is high. The funding follows an initial contract that was given earlier this year to test the viability of the technology. In the Phase II effort, TUI will develop and demonstrate methods to enable additive manufacturing of high performance support structures such as reflectors and antennas. Alongside this, TUI is working under a Nasa Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract to develop a ‘Trusselator’ device that will fabricate truss structures to enable in space construction of large solar arrays. The Trusselator device will fabricate truss structures to enable in space construction of large solar arrays . ‘The Trusselator is the key first step in implementing the SpiderFab architecture,’ said Dr Hoyt. ‘Once we’ve demonstrated that it works, we will be well on our way towards creating football field sized antennas and telescopes to help search for Earth like exoplanets and evidence of extraterrestrial life.’ The funding follows a string of projects by Nasa to develop 3D printing in space. Last month, the largest 3D printed . rocket engine component Nasa ever has tested blazed to life during an . engine firing that generated a record 20,000 pounds of thrust. The component was manufactured using selective laser melting. This method built up layers of nickel-chromium alloy powder to make the complex, subscale injector with its 28 elements for channeling and mixing propellants. The part was similar in size to injectors that power small rocket engines. It was similar in design to injectors for large engines, such as the RS-25 engine that will power NASA's Space Launch System  rocket for deep space human missions to an asteroid and Mars. This test was a milestone for one of many important advances the agency is making to reduce the cost of space hardware.","SpiderFab will build huge structures such as antennas and masts .

"After Natalie Morris broke her back in a horrific fall at home, she was warned she might never walk again. A vertebra in the 26-year-old’s spine cracked and burst open tearing ligaments and tendons which could have left her paralysed. Doctors feared the worst, describing the break as ‘toe curling’, but remarkably, Ms Morris has been left with no lasting injuries. Natalie Morris, 26, tripped and fell down a flight of stairs while trying to get to the bathroom in the night . She said: ‘I can’t believe how lucky I am. When I first went to A&E they thought I’d just banged myself up a bit, but as soon as my scans came back all hell broke loose. ‘Everyone presumed the worst and they told me that in a worst case scenario, I could be paralysed. I was terrified - I thought I’d never walk again. ‘They did some tests and luckily I had some feeling in my lower legs so it was a good sign, but I never thought I’d have recovered so quickly. ‘A doctor who saw me had been treating someone who’d had the same type of fall as me - but he’d been referred to another hospital because he’s never going to walk again. Ms Morris, from Rotherham, had to undergo a seven hour operation in which a cage was built around her spine to stabilise the fragile break of her T-12 vertebra. She also had a bone graft taken from her pelvis. She was initially told that it would take up to six months for her to recover but she amazed doctors by walking again within ten days. She told The Star, her local newspaper in Sheffield: ‘My surgeon told me I was a hair’s breadth away from being paralysed – the break was crazy. In the fall Ms Morris shattered a vertebra in her lower back and doctors said she was a 'hair's breadth' from being paralysed . ‘He said it made his toes curl and he didn’t know how on earth I was walking. I am very lucky. ‘The T-12 vertebra is where you do all your bending and moving for things like putting your shoes on. The way I’d fallen it had basically burst and all the ligaments around it had been damaged.’ Ms Morris, who works in finance, suffered the injury falling down the steep stairs in her home during the night. She said: ‘I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet but I didn’t turn on the light. Following her operation, Ms Morris was initially told it would take six months for her to recover . ‘I missed my footing on the way to the bathroom and the next thing I knew I was in a pile at the bottom of the stairs. ‘I didn’t really know what had happened but I could feel a searing pain right in the middle of my back. ‘Thanks to the adrenaline I was able to crawl over to my sofa where I rang NHS Direct. I explained what had happened and they told me to call an ambulance immediately. ‘On the way to the hospital there were 101 things going through my mind. I was so upset.’ At Doncaster Royal Infirmary, medics initially planned to send her home with painkillers, but a last minute X-ray revealed the true extent of her injuries. ‘I was in a bed behind a curtain waiting to go home when the doctor came in and told me he’d got some bad news - I’d fractured my spine. ‘I started to panic and went to get up but I was told that I needed to find a comfortable position and stay there. ‘It was important that I didn’t move at all because the break was so unstable It was very scary.’ After Ms Morris’s diagnosis an initial assessment by surgeons suggested that she may recover, but her future was still uncertain. ‘They gave me three options,’ she said. ‘I was told that I could do nothing, have a full body brace, or have surgery. I knew surgery was the best option so I was transferred to Bassetlaw Hospital. ‘The journey there was agony, but the worst part was that my operation wasn’t for three days, and for that whole time I had to lie flat barely moving a muscle and in incredible pain. I just felt so helpless.’ She underwent a seven-hour operation to stabilise her spine and was walking again ten days later . Luckily Ms Morris’s seven-hour operation was a success. ‘I woke up and straight away I knew things were better. I was still in pain, but I knew the pain was as a result of the surgery, not the fall. ‘Then the day after the operation the physio came to try and get me on my feet. Ms Morris's surgeon said she was lucky not to have damaged her spinal cord . ‘It was excruciating - it felt like every bone in my body was popping out - but I was determined to do it. ‘I had the surgery on a Wednesday, by the Saturday I was walking around and four days later I’d been discharged. ‘I don’t think anyone could quite believe it,’ she said. She added: ‘When I look back at what happened now, it was all a bit of a whirlwind. ‘I knew that no one else was going to get me walking again apart from me, so I just had to do it. Ms Morris’s surgeon at Bassetlaw Hospital in Worksop, Mr Ranjit Pande, said: ‘Natalie had an extremely unstable injury to her back following an accident. ‘Luckily, there was no injury to her spinal cord so we could stabilise her spine effectively. ‘I am very pleased with the outcome. ‘Natalie was very brave and positive throughout, and all credit goes to her.’ Ms Morris explained to The Star that she can now look after herself again and that her recovery is thanks to the surgery that Mr Pande carried out. She said: ‘He held my life in his hands and he saved it. I will always have a lasting memory and two scars to remind me, but I have my life and my legs.’","Natalie Morris, 26, fell down the stairs going to the bathroom in the night .

"Experts suggest that by exercising more and eating healthily we could live to the age of 120 . Scientists haven't quite figured how we can live forever - but they now say they have worked out how we could make it to 120. Experts suggest that exercising more, eating healthily and taking statins is the key to slowing the ageing process. Although a 'wonder-pill' is not in sight, making lifestyle changes such as cutting down on sugar, salt and fat and taking drugs that already exist might work, says the Longevity Science Panel. The group, which independently monitors evidence that explain changes in life expectancy and advises policymakers, found doing so took the average lifespan from 80 to 84. The 'What is ageing? And how do we delay it?' report states that at present few people live to around 110 - but by making these adjustments they predict that the healthiest individuals could live to 120. It explains that ageing happens because of problems in cell division - an essential function which leads to growth, organ development and the replacement of damaged cells. But it is errors that occur in this natural process that impacts on ageing, according to experts, along with lifestyle factors like smoking and drinking. Over-eating is said to cause a rise in cell mutation because it speeds up cell division. When cells divide they also shorten the protective caps called telomeres and consequently once they reach a certain size they stop dividing entirely. This process is known as senescence, which when it is built up in an organ it prevents the ability to repair damage and causes wrinkles and age spots. But the panel found this process can be slowed down by eating well, exercising and taking drugs which impact on pathways in the body. Dame Karen Dunnell, Chair of the Longevity Science Panel, said: 'From this research we have been able to build up a picture of the latest developments in this area. 'The experts tended to agree on which possible factors are important in understanding the biology of ageing. 'However, they did not necessarily agree on which are the most important components of the ageing process, or on which interventions might have the greatest potential for extending lifespan.' Tests revealed that a Mediterranean diet and possible calorie restriction lowered the incidence of age-related disease. A figure from the study which shows the percentage reduction in average mortality rate attributable to dietary restriction in laboratory animals and a projection of how this may translate for humans (Nakagawa et al 2012) Drugs such as statins, which have an anti-inflammatory effect in addition to lowering cholesterol, were also found to delay the ageing process. While the drug rapamycin, which has been shown to regulate cell division, increased the lifespan of mice by up to 26 per cent. And resveratrol, which comes from red wine and is sold in dietary supplements, extended the life in simple animals such as yeast, nematodes and killifish, but results have been inconsistent in other animals including mice and flies. Eating healthily - including a Mediterranean diet - has been said to extent life expectancy, according to experts . Richard Faragher, professor of Biogerontology at the University of Brighton, told The Sunday Telegraph that living healthier for longer was more important than increasing lifespan. 'Ageing occurs because the mechanisms which keep us in good health fail over time. 'After a variable number of divisions, cells will stop dividing and start to do bad stuff. 'So, in effect, all age related diseases are being driven by a few mechanisms which if you could control them, could be the difference between somebody hobbling down the street, or jogging past you.' According to the Office for National Statistics, life-expectancy at birth in England increased between 1981 and 2010 from 71 to 78 in men and 77 to 82 in women. The panel concluded that longevity will continue to increase in the next 10 years but the rate is likely to slow down.","Making lifestyle changes like cutting down on sugar and salt help longevity .

"Child rape: Baseball coach David Engle, pictured, 'repeatedly filmed himself raping two boys and had 450 sexual photos of his youth baseball players' A youth baseball coach was exposed as a prolific pedophile in one of the world's biggest ever child porn busts, it can be revealed today. David Scott Engle is believed to be the first American child sex offender officially identified as someone caught by investigators from Project Spade. Last month MailOnline reported Engle, a divorce lawyer from Lake Lucerne in Washington, was sentenced to 25 years in prison after amassing thousands of child pornography images. The 50-year-old will now stand trial on child rape charges after investigators found dozens of videos of him allegedly carrying out sickening sexual assaults on two boys. He was arrested in November last year when he was detected buying child pornography online, leading to the discovery that he had a collection of 450 images showing the clothed genitals of the boys he coached. And MailOnline can for the first time reveal that he was caught after operatives from sweeping child pornography investigation Project Spade discovered his internet activity. Members of the global team alerted local law enforcement who searched his home and a storage unit and discovered a stash of horrific home-made and purchased child pornography. Last night Emily Langlie from the United States Attorney's office told MailOnline: 'Project Spade put him on the radar of law enforcement officers. 'Then following the serving of warrants it became clear that Mr Engle was involved in not only the production of child pornography, but in child molestation against young victims.' So far Project Spade has led to the rescue of 386 young children around the world and the arrest of 348 people, among them nearly 80 American nationals. 'It is alleged that officers seized hundreds of thousands of videos detailing horrific sexual acts against very young children, some of the worst that they have ever viewed,' Toronto Inspector Joanna Beaven-Desjardins said. Scroll down for video . Massive haul: Canadian police described the Project Spade operation as one of the largest child porn busts they've ever seen . Police have revealed 108 people were arrested in Canada, 76 in the U.S and 164 in countries from Spain to South Africa and Australia. Forty school teachers, nine doctors and nurses, and more than 30 people who volunteered with kids were among those taken into custody. The list of suspects also includes nine clergymen, six police officers and three foster parents. Police said the children were 'rescued from child exploitation' but did not give more details. Beaven-Desjardins said the investigation began with a Toronto man accused of running a company since 2005 that distributed child pornography videos to the tune of $4million in revenue, CTV News reported. Police allege Brian Way, 42, instructed people around the world to create the videos of children ranging from 5 to 12 years of age, then distributed the videos via his company, Azov Films, to international customers. The videos included naked boys from Germany, Romania and Ukraine, which it marketed as naturist movies and claimed were legal in Canada and the United States. The head of the Toronto police sex crimes unit told the Toronto Star that the X-rated images displayed 'horrific acts of sexual abuse — some of the worst (officers) have seen.' Police said they executed a search warrant at Way's company and home, seizing about 1,000 pieces of evidence: computers, servers, DVD burners, a video editing suite and hundreds of movies. Global collaboration: More than 30 police officers from around the world gathered to announce the end of a 3-year child pornography investigation in Toronto . Way was charged with 24 offences, including child pornography. Police also designated Azov Films as a criminal organization, charging Way with giving directions on behalf of a gang. TheAzovfilms.com website has been shut down. And MailOnline can reveal Engle was part of the global network of paedophiles. Last month he was sentenced on federal child pornography charges but allegations that he raped one boy 'countless' times over six years remaining outstanding in state court. The baseball coach for 11 and 12-year-olds had gone to great lengths to have contact with children, and amassed an extensive collection of child pornography featuring boys the same age as the ones he taught, the court was told. Before his arrest, Engle had coached a youth baseball team, was president of Maple Valley Pony Baseball and Fast Pitch, served on two regional baseball organizations and one baseball business. Assistant U.S. Attorney Marci Ellsworth said the former coach abused the trust parents placed in him. 'While [Engle] was purportedly serving as a role model and mentor for these young boys, he was sexually interested in them,' Ms Ellsworth said in court papers. 'When [he] was taking pictures and shooting video of baseball games, his camera was focused on the players’ crotches, not on their batting stance, pitching arms, or any other aspect of their athletic performance.' Online filth: Police allege Brian Way, 42, instructed people around the world to create the videos of children ranging from 5 to 12 years of age, then distributed the videos via his company, Azov Films . Engle pleaded guilty in July to federal child pornography charges and admitted possessing hundreds of videos of children being sexually abused. Now he has been sentenced on those charges, the child rape case can proceed with any state sentence following on from the 25-year term just handed to Engle. King County prosecutors have charged him with three counts of child rape over allegations that he was shown raping a boy in several videos. About 1,400 photos and 40 videos allegedly show Engle raping one boy, and three videos show abuse of a second child. In one Engle filmed himself watching baseball on TV as the boy he was raping struggled and told him 'No'. The assaults only stopped after his arrest. 'This is a heart-wrenching betrayal of trust of the victims and the community,' U.S. Attorney Jenny A. Durkan said in a statement. Engle was caught after postal inspectors joined an international investigation into Azovfilms.com. All walks of life: Police said 108 people were arrested in Canada, 76 in the U.S and 164 in countries from Spain to South Africa and Australia, among them teachers, doctors and priests . He spent $2,300 on videos and photos sent to him by the company between 2005 and 2011, according to Q13Fox, but when police raided his home they found child pornography well beyond the purchases he made from the website they had been investigating. His 'collection of child pornography consisted predominantly of young boys in the same age range as those [he] coached in youth baseball,' Ms Ellsworth told the court. She added: '[Engle] had many pictured of the boys he coached – including nearly 450 pictures of their clothed genital regions – which, although … not pornographic in nature, are nonetheless disturbing.' His conviction is a significant result for Project Spade, which began in 2010 and worked with Interpol in more than 50 countries including Australia, Spain, Mexico, Norway and Greece. More than 350,000 images and over 9,000 videos - about 45 terabytes - of child sexual abuse were found during the probe, and arrests are continuing. Norwegian police spokesman Bjoern-Erik Ludvigsen said in a statement: 'This operation shows that international police cooperation works. Despite large amounts of material and that this is time-consuming work, this shows that the Internet is not a safe haven for crimes against children,' The U.S. Postal Inspection Service said it began its investigation by accessing the company website and making undercover purchases.","David Scott Engle, from Lake Lucerne, Washington, is believed to be the first US child sex offender officially identified as someone caught by investigators from Project Spade .

"The girlfriend of the co-pilot on board the missing Malaysia airlines flight is holed up in a hotel with his family as she anxiously awaits news of the plane's fate. Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, was planning to marry his girlfriend Captain Nadira Ramli, 26, a fellow pilot from another airline. The Sabah-based Daily Express said that . Miss Nadira, 26, has been given a month's leave as she awaits news of the . flight's final destination. Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, was planning to marry his girlfriend Captain Nadira Ramli, 26, a fellow pilot from another airline . Details of the relationship emerged as it . was revealed flight MH370's captain is a relative of Malaysia's jailed . opposition leader. Intensive background checks on everyone aboard . had turned up no-one else with a political or criminal motive to crash or . hijack the plane. Interest in the co-pilot of the missing Malyasia airlines plane has been renewed after it was revealed this week that he was the last person to communicate from the cockpit after the communication system was cut off. Mr Hamid met Miss Nadira when they studied together at the Langkawi pilot school and the couple have known each other for nine years. Miss Nadira flies for Malaysia-based budget carrier AirAsia - Malaysia Airlines' fierce rival - and is the daughter of a senior Malaysia Airlines pilot, local media reports said. Nadira Ramli is now with Mr Fariq's distraught mother at an undisclosed hotel in Kuala Lumpur . A relative in Kota Kinabalu, who declined to be named, told the newspaper that described the young pilot was calm in the face of adversity 'and a pillar of strength to Fariq's mother who had hardly slept for three days'. 'Nadira is positive about the incident and told her family not to listen to the TV. Despite what has happened, she still has a glimmer of hope,' said the relative. The paper added that Miss Nadira was the youngest child of Captain Ramli Ibrahim and Nancy Jipanis of Penampang in Sabah. Hamid had his reputation called into question by a South African woman who accused him of inviting her to join him in the cockpit for a journey in 2011, in breach of security rules. Malaysia Airlines said it was 'shocked' by the reported security violation, but could not verify the claims. Hamid had his reputation called into question by a South African woman who accused him of inviting her to join him in the cockpit for a journey in 2011, in breach of security rules . Malaysia Airlines said it was 'shocked' by the reported security violation, but could not verify the claims . But those who knew him have described the son of a top state civil servant as a mild-mannered young man with a bright piloting future. Fariq regularly visited his neighbourhood mosque outside Kuala Lumpur where he also attended occasional Islamic courses, said Ahmad Sharafi Ali Asrah, the mosque's imam or spiritual leader, who called him 'a good boy'. Fariq appeared in a CNN travel segment in February in which he helped fly a plane from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. A woman walks past the missing Malaysia Airlines co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid's house in Shah Alam, outside Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . It chronicled his transition to piloting the Boeing 777-200 after having completed training in a flight simulator. CNN correspondent Richard Quest called Fariq's technique 'textbook-perfect,' according to the network's website. Details of Fariq's personal life emerged as it was revealed today that his 'fanatical' co-pilot is related to Malaysia's jailed opposition leader. After previously denying he . recognised the pliot's name, opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim admitted . that Malaysia Airlines MH370 Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is related to . his son-in-law. 'I am not denying that he (Zaharie) is related to one of my in-laws and that I have met him on several occasions,' he said. After previously denying he reconigsed his name, . opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, left, has admitted that Malaysia . Airlines MH370 pilot Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, right, is related to . his son in law . He also admitted Zaharie is a close friend of PKR supreme council member and Subang MP R. Sivarasa. He added: 'To politicise this is not . right. We should respect the family's rights and pray for them instead . of prosecuting him before the investigation is completed.' Anwar . further admitted that Zaharie was a staunch opposition supporter and . that he had met the pilot on a few occasions at party functions. He said: 'I am not one to hide my associations with others. I have met him once or twice but I do not remember how many times.' The government has called on the public not to 'jump to conclusions' about the two men, saying they were not on record as asking to fly together on March 8. Sympathetic tributes to them have poured out online. In a YouTube memorial a collage of photos from various stages of Zaharie's life shows him happily socialising with friends and family, flying model airplanes, and doing volunteer work as the song 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' plays. A relative of a Chinese passenger aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 shows a paper reading 'Hunger strike protest, Respect life, Return my relative, Don't want become victim of politics, Tell the truth' Also today, China's ambassador to . Malaysia said his country had carried out a detailed probe into its . nationals aboard the flight and could rule out their involvement. U.S. and European security sources said efforts by various governments to . investigate the backgrounds of everyone on the flight had not, as of . Monday, turned up links to militant groups or anything else that could . explain the jet's disappearance. A European diplomat in Kuala Lumpur also said trawls through the passenger manifest had come up blank. Families of the passengers aboard the missing plane decided to organize a hunger strike to express their anger and disappointment at the handling of the situation by authorities . They decided on the action after a daily morning meeting with two officials from Malaysia Airlines . Meanwhile, furious Chinese families today . threatened to go on hunger strike until the Malaysian government tells . them the truth about the fate of their relatives aboard the flight which . went missing en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Ten . days after the airliner vanished an hour into its flight, hundreds of . family members are still waiting for information in a Beijing hotel. Around two thirds of the 239 passengers on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are Chinese. Families . vented their pain and anger on Chinese representatives sent by the . airline to meet them on Tuesday and demanded to see the Malaysian . ambassador. 'What we want is the truth. Don't let . them become victims of politics. No matter what political party you . are, no matter how much power you have, if there isn't life, what's the . point? Where is compassion?' asked one middle-aged woman angrily. 'You're . always going back and forth. I think your government knows in their . heart why we want you to answer us. Because you're always tricking us, . telling us lies,' added one man. A pilot of an AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft scanning the surface of the sea during a search operation for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 to the west of Peninsula Malaysia . China . has repeatedly called on the Malaysian side to do a better job at . looking after the relatives of the Chinese passengers, and to provide . them with updated information. Today . China announced checks into the background of all the Chinese nationals . on board the missing Malaysian jetliner have uncovered no links to . terrorism. The remarks by . the Chinese ambassador in Kuala Lumpur will dampen speculation that . Uighur separatists in far western Xinjiang province might have been . involved with the disappearance of the Boeing 777 and its 239 passengers . and crew early on March 8. The . plane was carrying 154 Chinese passengers, when Malaysian officials say . someone on board deliberately diverted it from its route to Beijing . less than one hour into the flight. A massive search operation has yet to find any trace of the plane. Chinese . Ambassador to Malaysia Huang Huikang said today that background checks . on Chinese nationals did not uncover any evidence suggesting they were . involved in hijacking or an act of terrorism against the plane, . according to state news agency Xinhua. He also said that Chinese authorities had begun searching for the plane on its territory. Two RAAF Orions have been assigned to the Malaysian-coordinated search for Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 . The Australian Marine Safety Authority (AMSA) is coordinating a search of water spanning more than 600,000 square kilometres, some 3200km southwest of Perth . Malaysian . police are investigating the pilots and ground engineers of the plane, . and have asked intelligence agencies from countries with passengers on . board to carry out background checks on those passengers. They say they are . investigating the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or . issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on . board, but have yet to give any update on what they have uncovered. Late yesterday it emerged that the . turn that diverted the missing Malaysian Airlines plane off its flight . path was programmed into the aircraft's computer navigation system, . probably by someone in the cockpit, the New York Times reported. That . reinforces the increasing belief among investigators that the aircraft . was deliberately diverted, the newspaper said, quoting U.S. officials. Rather . than manually operating the plane's controls, whoever altered Flight . 370's path typed seven or eight keystrokes into a computer situated . between the captain and the co-pilot, according to officials. The computer is called the Flight Management System. Captured: Airport security CCTV of Zaharie Ahmad Shah, pilot of Malaysia Boeing 777 Airlines flight . Malaysian . military radar spotted the plane in the northern reaches of the Strait . of Malacca at 2.14am local time on March 8, just over 90 minutes after . it took off from Kuala Lumpur. That is the plane's last known confirmed position. Today . Australian authorities said they had begun searching 600,000 square . kilometres of the remote Indian Ocean for missing Malaysia Airlines . flight MH370, and conceded it was like looking for a needle in a . haystack. British Prime Minister David Cameron also today telephoned his Malaysian counterpart to offer Britain's help in dealing with the disappearance of Flight MH370. Mr Cameron also told Najib Razak that his thoughts were with the families of those who were on board the Malaysian Airways jet, which went missing on March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. It was the first direct contact between the two prime ministers since the mystery began, said Mr Cameron's official spokesman. The Malaysian . government has revealed it believes the jet was deliberately diverted . and flew for several hours after leaving its scheduled flight path - . either north towards Central Asia, or towards the southern Indian Ocean.","Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, was planning to marry Captain Nadira Ramli, 26 .

"Roy Keane has revealed he didn't sign Robbie Savage when he was Sunderland manager because the midfielder's voicemail message was 'Hi, it's Robbie - whazzup!'. Savage at the time was struggling for playing time at Blackburn and Keane wanted to bring him to the Stadium of Light in a bid to boost his side's performance. But Savage didn't answer Keane's call and the Irishman changed his mind when he heard the player's voicemail, based on the catchphrase from the Budweiser advert in the early 2000s. The Welshman was struggling for game time at Blackburn when Roy Keane enquired about signing him . Since his retirement from football the joker has appeared on shows like BBC's 'Strictly Come Dancing' In his new autobiography The Second Half, Keane explains: 'I rang Mark Hughes. Robbie [Savage] wasn’t in the Blackburn team and I asked Mark if we could try to arrange a deal. 'Sparky said, ""Yeah, yeah he's lost his way here but he could still do a job for you."" 'Robbie's legs were going a bit but I thought he might come up to us [at Sunderland] with his long hair, and give us a lift – the way Yorkie [Dwight Yorke] had, a big personality in the dressing room. 'Sparky gave me permission to give him a call. So I got Robbie's mobile number and rang him. 'It went to his voicemail, ""Hi it’s Robbie – whazzup!"" like the Budweiser ad. The midfielder had successful spells at Birmingham City and Derby County, where he ended his career . Savage now plies his trade as a television pundit on BBC's flagship football show, Match of the Day . 'I never called him back. I thought: ""I can’t be f***ing signing that.”’ Keane's objection was possibly not only to the puerile message but also the fact that, by the time he heard the message, it was years out of date. Responding on Twitter, Savage said: 'Oh come on Roy whattttsuppppppppp !!!! Hahahaha. 'Whether or not Roy did try and sign me I chose derby over Sunderland as they offered me more and I didn't want to move house !! 'But it's great to know Roy keane obviously liked me as a player as he was one of best midfielders ever !! #whatssuppppppp.' Savage then took to the social media site to offer his fans a prize-winning opportunity: 'Whats the funniest thing you've heard on answer phone messege [sic] best one I'll give a signed golf shoe by me.scholesy,vaughny Hargreaves'.

She said: 'I always got a good response from them, but because it had been done before by other artists, I never felt like it was ""my own"". 'I was getting ready to go to a show one night and put on a bit of red lipstick. I blotted it on a piece of paper and it hit me. 'I started experimenting and decided Marilyn Monroe would be the perfect candidate for a portrait with kisses!' Ms Irish admitted that her lips get very tired, and that she owns 'many tubes of both lipstick and chapstick'. She said her eyes get tired from constantly moving between very close to farther back from the canvas to examine her work. Getting cheeky on her website, natalieirish.com, she wrote of herself, 'There are rumors that she has been creating works of art since in utero. 'Following her birth, Natalie Irish quickly began to shock and amaze every entity with her astonishing artwork of all conceivable mediums and dominate all competitions of the arts'. Ms Irish goes on to claim that she . earned Best in District at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo Art . Competition when she was five years old. She then went on to study with the . Galveston Arts Alliance, and attended the University of North Texas, . where she studied metalsmithing and ceramics.

"A driver has come forward saying the deputy who shot dead a 13-year-old California boy after mistaking his fake AK-47 as real pulled a gun on him also, after he failed to signal a lane change during a carpool. Jeff Westbrook, 57, of Santa Rosa said he was mistreated by Deputy Erick Gelhaus after being pulled over Aug. 21 in Cotati, so much so that at one point he asked Gelhaus: 'Sir, is there something wrong with you?' 'I felt like I was watching somebody I needed to help,' Mr Westbrook, . a program manager at an information technology company, told CBS of Gelhaus. 'This was . not right. He did not manage this correctly.' Gelhaus shot Andy Lopez seven times at a Santa Rosa parking after recieving reports of a suspicious and believing his toy machine gun was real. Mr Westbrook was pulled over by Gelhaus for not using his indicator. He said he pulled into a shoulder, but offered to move the car forward because there was not much room next to the driver door for Gelhaus. When the car started moving, Gelhaus is alleged to have drawn his gun. 'It was about a foot from by face,' Westbrook said. 'I've never had a gun pointed at me before.' Scroll down for video . Tragic: Andy Lopez (right) was shot dead by Sheriff's deputy Erick Gelhaus (left) after he mistook the teenagers replica AK-47 for a real weapon . Jess Westbrook claims to have had a gun pulled on him by deputy sheriff Eric Gelhaus two months before the tragic death of Andy Lopez. Mr Westbrook says he thought that Gelhaus was 'emotional unstable' and is now 'struggling' with not taking his complaint further . Having recognized Gelhaus in the widespread coverage of Lopez's death, Mr Westbrook is now 'struggling' with the fact he didn't press harder with his complaint. 'I'm wondering, if I had fought this a little more aggressively - . actually waved around like a chimpanzee with my arms in the air to the . district attorney's office and come down there physically - that maybe . something could have changed,' he said. 'I don't know.' The new claim comes after investigators recently revealed how quickly Gelhaus opened fire on Lopez. Investigators confirmed that a second officer, a trainee, stayed at the wheel of the police car while Gelhaus approached the boy. According to the Press Democrat, Santa Rosa police Lieutenant Paul Henry said that within seconds Gelhaus ordered the teenager to drop the weapon before his partner could take cover behind the open door of the vehicle. The account seems to back up eyewitness claims and dispatch records that claim that only ten seconds elapsed between Gelhaus confronting Lopez and shooting him. Andy Lopez was killed by police earlier this month . The latest development comes as protestors continue to call for Gelhaus to face charges over the shooting. Lieutenant Henry told the Press Democrat: 'Deputy Gelhaus was able to engage more quickly because he didn't have to drive the vehicle. 'By the time (Gelhaus's partner) had exited his door and taken cover, at that point Deputy Gelhaus had already engaged the subject, with the commands and with the weapon. 'The threat was essentially over.' Police also revealed that Lopez was wearing a hooded sweatshirt but had the hood down and was not wearing headphones that might have affected his hearing. The patrol car Gelhaus and his partner were using was not equipped with either audio or video recording equipment. Yesterday hundreds of demonstrators marched to protest the fatal shooting which has sparked community outrage and an FBI investigation.

Lifelike: At a news conference police displayed a real assault weapon and the pellet gun, left, to demonstrate how difficult it can be to tell them apart . According to his online profiles, Gelhaus served as an infantry squad leader in Iraq and is an avid hunter in North America as well as Africa. However, officials told Sfgate.com the deputy has not fired at a suspect in 24 years with the department, where he serves as a field training officer for new recruits and trains colleagues to shoot at the department's gun range. But in a 2008 article for monthly policing and gun rights magazine, S.W.A.T., he gave other officers advice on what to do if the possibility arises. 'Today is the day you may need to kill someone in order to go home,' he wrote. 'If you cannot turn on the 'mean gene' for yourself, who will? If you find yourself in an ambush, in the kill zone, you need to turn on that mean gene.' He went on: 'Taking some kind of action - any kind of action - is critical. If you shut down (physically, psychologically, or both) and stay in the kill zone, bad things will happen to you. You must take some kind of action.'

"Rescuers in Philadelphia pulled a man from the wreckage of a collapsed building on Monday - and then promptly arrested him for looting. The abandoned three-storey building in the north of the city had been reduced to rubble after Superstorm Sandy battered the east coast of the United States. Firefighters working to make the building safe didn't think anyone was inside, until they heard someone crawling out of the rubble. After helping him to safety, police officers arrested him for disorderly conduct on the suspicion that he had crawled in to the building, located on Cumberland Street, looking for things to loot. The exact cause of the building's collapse is still unknown but Philadelphia has been buffeted by 50mph gusts as a result of the storm. Scroll down for video . Anybody in there? Firefighters believed the collapsed building in the north of Philadelphia was empty until they heard the man crawling out of the wreckage .

What are you doing here? A firefighter casts a suspicious glance at the man as he walks free . What shall we do with him? The firefighter and a colleague discuss whether to get the police involved . Wreckage: The three-storey building in the north of the city had collapsed as Superstorm Sandy battered the area . It came as thousands of National Guard troops were mobilised to prevent looting sprees on homes and shops in New York and Long Island. Scores of trouble makers took to Twitter threatening to ransack stores and burgle abandoned homes as Sandy passed. It prompted the New York National Guard to deploy 1,175 troops in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley to maintain law and order. Abandoned: Thousands of shops and businesses were boarded up before the superstorm struck, including this branch of Saks on Fifth Avenue in New York . Prepared: A boarded up pizza restaurant in Hoboken, New Jersey . The use of Twitter to organise looting has echoes of last year's London riots and follows a phenomenon of 'flash robberies' in America in which organised mobs descend on stores or individuals to steal goods. The plans are made on social networking sites such as Facebook or by e-mail. One Twitter user called 'GT: OpTic TUMES' wrote on Monday: 'Just started a looting clan. LL - Luscious Looters. Message @OpTicPauL. for tryouts must have mask. #HurricaneSandy.' Another, Matt Worman, posted on Sunday: 'Bout to do some looting when this hurricane finally hits...gonna get a new laptop and tv...this hurricane might be the best thing to happen.' Lucas Emil wrote: 'If this hurricane gets real bad I'm looting stores! I always wanted to do that...' Threats: The deluge of threatening tweets prompted the New York National Guard to deploy over 1,000 troops to maintain law and order . Looters often take advantage of hurricanes to loot - the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 became notorious for large scale lawlessness in New Orleans. The practice became so commonplace that police officers were eventually told not to stop people ransacking stores. Police were caught on camera looting a Wal-Mart store, later claiming 'they had received permission from superiors to take necessities for themselves and other officers.' Abandoned homes were also pillaged during Hurricane Irene last year. Ransacked: Stores in New Orleans were looted in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, causing millions of pounds of damage . Carnage: A young boy emerges from a trashed convenience store in St Louis, Mississippi in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . The National Guard said they had been mobilised to 'provide command and control and logistical support', adding that one of the troops' main duties would be to 'protect against looting.' The move came as President Obama declared a 'major disaster' in New York and Long Island after the Superstorm hit overnight, leaving the area looking like the set of a disaster movie. Sandy hit the mainland at 6.30pm local time on Monday, having battered the eastern coast all day with 13ft waves, causing widespread flooding, damage to buildings and power cuts.","Rescuers helped the man from a collapsed building in the north of Philadelphia before arresting him on suspicion of looting .

"China may be using thousands of miles of underground tunnels to hide a nuclear missile arsenal that is far bigger than current estimates, according to researchers. They spent three years translating secret military documents, scouring the internet and studying satellite images for clues – and concluded that China may have as many as 3,000 missiles, compared with general estimates of between 80 and 400. The researchers at Georgetown University, led by a former senior Pentagon official, concentrated on a 3,000-mile network of tunnels dug largely in Sichuan province by the Chinese Second Artillery, a secretive unit responsible for protecting the country’s nuclear weapons. Stockpiling: Missiles being test-fired at an undisclosed location. A group of university students have uncovered evidence that China may have many more nuclear weapons than previously thought . Capabilities: After translating secret military documents, forums and studying images of a network of tunnels in China, the students believe the country could have as many as 3,000 warheads . In 2008, thousands of radiation technicians were sent to the region after it was hit by a huge earthquake. When TV pictures showed oddly collapsed hills across the province, officials eventually admitted there was a network of tunnels underneath, dubbing it their ‘Underground  Great Wall’. The 363-page study, as yet unpublished, has been discussed in Congress and circulated among defence officials. It was commissioned as ‘homework’ by the students’ professor, Phillip Karber, a prominent Washington defence strategist during the Cold War. ‘It’s not quite a bombshell, but those thoughts and estimates are being checked against what people think they know based on classified information,’ said a defence department official. Critics have questioned the study’s use of internet research, including blogs and even a Chinese TV drama about artillerymen. Concerns: A Chinese naval vessel fires missiles during an exercise off the Shangdong peninsula . Nuclear analyst Gregory Kulacki said the tunnels might encourage the Chinese to have fewer rather than more missiles in the belief that they were better protected. Nuclear non-proliferation campaigners have also attacked the report, saying it will undermine efforts to reduce atomic weapon stockpiles. But Mark Stokes of the Project 2049 Institute, an international security think-tank, said the report highlighted ‘the uncertainty about what China has’. Might: China's military has been expanding rapidly and in 2009 it admitted the existence of 3,000 miles of underground tunnels . Force: New recruits for the Chinese People's Liberation Army stand at attention in Suining city. The study also shows how the military transports missiles through its tunnel network . Professor Karber said: ‘I don’t have the slightest idea how many nuclear weapons China really has, but neither does anyone else in the arms-control community. ‘That’s the problem with China – no one really knows except them.’ China has long been the most secretive of the five nuclear powers recognised by the international Non-Proliferation Treaty. While Russia and America have bilateral treaties that ensure their stockpiles are monitored, the Chinese have simply claimed they keep a small number of missiles for ‘minimum deterrence’. The U.S. has 5,000 nuclear warheads, and Russia 8,000. Underground: The study began after the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province revealed strangely collapsed hills that were believe to have tunnels underneath them .","Georgetown University student spent three years translating secret military documents and blogs .

"A scientific breakthrough has offered a glimpse into the vicious circle of negative thinking suffered by people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Researchers have discovered that the part of the brain associated with feelings of guilt is also highly active in people with OCD. The findings, published by British scientists today, could lead to new ways of treating the distressing disorder. The new findings could lead to new ways of treating the distressing disorder, suffered by David Beckham (left) and Cameron Diaz (right) A key characteristic of OCD is . believing that negative thoughts will become a reality, leading to a . spiralling build-up of anxiety and guilt. Celebrities such as . David Beckham, Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake have spoken of their . struggles with OCD, which is one of the least understood mental . illnesses. It is thought to affect around 12 people in every 1,000 in Britain. The new study looked at brain wave patterns in people with varying degrees of OCD symptoms. Scientists . from Goldsmiths College in London and the University of Winchester . found that feelings of anxiety and guilt were associated with increased . activity in a brain region called the precuneus. Previous . research has linked the precuneus with the processing of . self-attribution, responsibility, causal reasoning, and ‘moral . transgression’ guilt. Psychopaths, who lack a sense of guilt, have been shown to possess a small precuneus. The new study looked at brain wave patterns in people with varying degrees of OCD symptoms. Justin Timberlake is another sufferer . Professor . Joydeep Bhattacharya, from Goldsmiths College, said: ‘OCD sufferers . experience more guilt and anxiety out of the kind of negative thoughts . we might all have from time to time. ‘For . example they might imagine a loved one dying in a car crash and believe . that somehow it increases the chances that it will actually happen. ‘Once they have these thoughts they feel guilty and subsequently make attempts to suppress and neutralise them, but fail, so entering into a vicious circle.’ Many people with the condition report they cannot stop thoughts and images intruding in the mind. The condition is often marked by obsessive, repetitive behaviour aimed at reducing anxiety. Some of the least disabling forms of the disorder can add an extra hour to the day’s routine, causing distress and interfering with daily life. Some people are so affected that they cannot leave their homes. The study, published in the journal Neuroimage Clinical, found that precuneus activity was greater in individuals with more extreme OCD symptoms. Activity increased when an individual experienced greater ‘thought-action fusion’ - the belief that a negative event will become reality. Co-author Dr Rhiannon Jones, from the University of Winchester, said: ‘These findings could possibly prove to be a significant step towards treating OCD. ‘Our next step is to use brain stimulation methods to attempt to modify thought-action fusion. That will allow us to confirm the causal role of these neural findings, and hopefully find a way to reduce these harmful thought-cycles.’","Part of the brain linked to guilt is also highly active in people with OCD .

"A lucky couple told today how they nearly missed out on a £1.8million lottery win - after putting their ticket out for recycling. Richard and Diona Buss bought a weekly ticket covering both Wednesday and Saturday’s draws while on holiday in Cornwall. But after the Wednesday draw drew a blank Richard, 48, put the ticket in the waste paper pile and thought nothing more of it. In luck: Dione and Richard Buss from Bridgewater as they celebrate their £1.8m National Lottery jackpot win . It was only rescued when Mrs Buss, 47, had a last-minute 'niggling feeling' and retrieved the slip - which perfectly matched the Saturday draw numbers. But the delighted couple were unable to confirm their win for 12 hours because the Camelot office was closed - and Mrs Buss kept her mind busy by ironing through the night. When they were finally able to officially confirm their winning amount, of £1,888,630, the pair said they were 'dumbfounded'. Jackpot: Tax collector Dione Buss and property developer husband Richard scooped the their £1.8m National Lottery prize with a ticket they threw away in the bin . Dione, who works as a local tax collector, said: 'We buy a weekly ticket for the two draws, on a Wednesday and a Saturday. 'Richard had already put the ticket on the recycling pile after the first draw, forgetting we still had Saturday to go. 'I dread to think what had happened if it had just been recycled, we very nearly lost all that money. 'Thankfully I had a niggling feeling and checked the ticket and saw that it still had that final draw on it that we hadn’t checked. 'When we realised we’d won and the amount we’d won it was absolutely unbelievable. 'It still hasn’t sunk in really, we’re still a bit dumbfounded.' Travel plans: Richard and Dione Buss plan to travel the world with their new found fortune . The couple bought the ticket while on holiday with their parents, daughter Harriet, 19, and her boyfriend, in St Ives, Cornwall, at the end of September. The Wednesday draw passed while they were away and Mr Buss tossed the ticket into the recycling pile when they returned home to Stogursey, Somerset. But the following night - September 28 - they hit the jackpot and did not realise they had won until the following day when Dione retrieved the ticket. The modest pair now plan to travel the . world, visiting places they have never been, including climbing the . Great Wall of China, as well as fundraise for a hospital unit at . Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, very close to MS-suffer Dione’s heart. 'We want to do some fundraising with the money really,' Dione, who now plans to give up her job with Bristol City Council. 'I . have always wanted to do it and now I have the perfect excuse to, it . will be great to give back to people who have given us so much.' Mr Buss, . a property developer, added that the pair also plan to buy a classic . car, as well as a plot of land to build a house on. He . said: 'We’ve also been given a list from Harriet, who wants a Fiat 500 . and a horse. I think that’s manageable. And I want to build up my . collection of guitars.

A media scrum then followed as they were moved from the room to another part of the hotel. Sky News reporter Kay Burley appeared to fall while getting off an escalator as the two women were chased by members of the media. Investigators searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane have, meanwhile, discounted reports the plane may have been sighted over the Maldives. Several residents of Kudahuvadhoo, one . of the more remote atolls in the Indian Ocean island chain nation, had . reported seeing a low-flying aircraft on the morning of March 8, when . Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Hishammuddin Hussein told a daily news . conference today that the reports had been investigated by police in the .

'The working assumption is that it went . south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that . corridor,' said the source.

Airline officials said they were deeply touched by the vast public response and by the faith shown by most of those who signed - a faith that the jet might be found and the passengers will be still alive. Most of the signatures, which have swelled by the thousands each day, say their prayers are with the passengers with most messages saying simply: MH370, Come Home Safely. Investigators are also trying to restore files deleted last month from the home flight simulator of the pilot aboard the missing plane to see if they shed any light on the disappearance, Malaysia's defence minister said today. Hishammuddin Hussein told a news . conference that the pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, is considered . innocent until proven guilty of any wrongdoing, and that members of his . family are cooperating in the investigation. Investigators are trying to restore files deleted last month from the home flight simulator of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah to see if they shed any light on the disappearance . Files containing records of simulations carried out on the program were deleted February 3, Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu said. Deleting files would not necessarily represent anything unusual, especially if it were to free up memory space, but investigators would want to check the files for any signs of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanations, but have said the evidence so far suggests the flight was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca. They are unsure what happened next. Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, and have asked for background checks from abroad on all foreign passengers. Hishammuddin said such checks have been received for all the foreigners except those from Ukraine and Russia - which account for three passengers - and that nothing suspicious has turned up so far. Planes sweeping across vast expanses of the Indian Ocean and satellites peering on Central Asia have turned up no new clues in the hunt. 'It's really too much. I don't know why it is taking so long for so many people to find the plane. It's 12 days,' Subaramaniam Gurusamy, 60, said in an interview from his home on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur.

Aircraft from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand on Wednesday scoured a search area stretching across 117,000 square miles of the Indian Ocean, about 1,600 miles southwest of Perth, on Australia's west coast. Merchant ships were also asked to look for any trace of the plane. Nothing has been found, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. China has said it was reviewing radar data and deployed 21 satellites to search the northern corridor of the search area stretching as far as Kazakhstan, although it is considered less likely that the plane could have taken that route without being detected. Those searches so far have turned up no trace of the plane, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Wednesday. Indonesian Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said Indonesia military radar didn't pick up any signs of Flight 370 on the day the plane went missing. He said Malaysia had asked Indonesia to intensify the search in its assigned zone in the Indian Ocean west of Sumatra, but said his air force was strained in the task. 'We will do our utmost. We will do our best. But you do have to understand our limitations,' Purnomo said. Hismammuddin said both the southern and the northern sections of the search area were important, but that 'some priority was being given to that (southern) area.' He did not elaborate.","Officials confirm Malaysia has received radar data from other countries .

"A man on a zero-hours contract was so scared of losing work by calling in sick he went in with a blood clot on his brain. Latvian Guntars Zarins, 52, feared he would have received a 'strike' against his name if he had taken a day off from his job at the Sports Direct warehouse in Bolsover, Derbyshire. Instead of phoning doctors and calling in sick, the 52-year-old dragged himself to the depot - but the father-of-two collapsed at work and was rushed to hospital on December 19. Latvian Guntars Zarins (left and right), feared he would have received a 'strike' against his name if he had taken a day off from his job at the Sports Direct warehouse . Instead of phoning doctors and calling in sick the 52-year-old dragged himself to the depot (pictured) in Bolsover, Derbyshire before collapsing . He is now out of a coma having undergone a life-saving operation to drain the blood from his brain - but he remains paralysed. His family claim that taking a day off ill can result in a strike against a worker's name and that after three or four strikes, workers can be fired. Mr Zarins came to Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, from Latvia four years ago and usually works five days a week at the depot. In the run up to Christmas he was working six days a week and had worked for the company for four years, earning the minimum wage. In the days leading to his collapse, he had suffered flu-like symptoms but had continued going to work. Mr Zarins had had a tracheotomy fitted just a couple of months before after a chest infection. His family are now continually by his bedside because he is still in a critical condition after suffering an embolism. He is paralysed down one half of his body, despite being conscious. Daughter Liga, 28, and her partner Kris Shaw, 34, who also works in a warehouse, are set to get married on January 3 - and Mr Zarins will not be fit enough to make it. They will go to the hospital on their wedding day so Mr Zarins can see his daughter in her wedding dress and give her away to Mr Shaw. Mr Zarins (pictured) is now out of a coma having undergone a life-saving operation to drain the blood from his brain - but his family says he remains paralysed . She claimed taking a day off ill can result in a strike against a worker's name. After three or four strikes, she says, workers can be fired. Liga, who lives in Kirkby, Merseyside, said: 'About a week before my dad collapsed he started complaining about fever, bad chest and headaches. 'We just thought it was because of the cold weather and we told him to take some time off. But he said ""I can't because I'll get a strike"". 'In the days leading up to it his cough was getting heavier and he was looking more and more tired, I can't believe they didn't tell him to go home. 'The doctors said that the stress of working six days a week would have pushed him over the edge.' Mr Zarins' wife, Lena, 50, works as a cleaner at the warehouse, which employs 5,000 people. Mr Shaw said that when Mr Zarins collapsed, they did not receive a phone call from Sports Direct. Liga said: 'Every day he's improving and we're looking forward to the new year when we can hopefully see some progress. 'Though doctors have said we shouldn't expect a miracle and that a lot of hard work and patience is required.'

"Asian military officials may be staging a mass cover-up over missing flight MH370, because they do not want to expose gaping holes within their countries' air defences, a leading aviation expert has suggested. The Malaysian Airlines jet went missing 1.30am on Sunday, March 9. But it wasn't until the following Tuesday that the Malaysian Air Force reported they had spotted the aircraft on radar over the Strait of Malacca at 2.15am. Now Thailand's military say they detected a plane at 1.28am, eight minutes after MH370's communications went down, heading towards the Strait but didn't share the information because they were not asked for it. Spotted: Thai military say they picked up an unidentified aircraft on radar bearing off the flight path, heading left over Malaysia and towards the Strait of Malacca . The revelation comes on a day when it emerged the captain of flight MH370 is a relative of Malaysia's jailed opposition leader. After previously denying he . recognised the pliot's name, opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim admitted . that Malaysia Airlines MH370 Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is related to . his son-in-law. Intensive background checks on everyone aboard . had turned up no-one else with a political or criminal motive to crash or . hijack the plane. It was also revealed girlfriend of the co-pilot is holed up in a hotel with his family awaiting news of the plane's fate. Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, was planning to marry his girlfriend Captain Nadira Ramli, 26, a fellow pilot from another airline. Writing on his blog, Aviation expert David Learmount said: 'Maybe these states’ air defences, like Malaysia’s, are not what they are cracked up to be. 'And maybe they wouldn’t want the rest of the world to know that.' Mr Learmount, a former pilot and now operations and safety editor at the respected Flight Global publication, points out that MH370 might have flown over several Asian countries including Thailand, Burma, China, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan. Holding back: Aviation expert David Learmount suggested some countries may be withholding radar information . He said said they may be withholding vital radar data about Flight MH370 for fear it would expose gaping holes in their multibillion pound air defences. If it emerges that an unidentified aircraft had been able to fly over a territory undetected and unchallenged it would amount to an embarrassing security failure. Regarding the Malaysian sighting Mr Learmount wrote: 'Clearly they had let an unidentified aircraft pass through Malaysian sovereign territory without bothering to identify it; not something they were happy to admit. 'The Malaysian government has called upon all the countries to the north-west as far as Turkmenistan and the Caspian Sea to check their primary radar records for unidentified contacts in their airspace in the seven hours after the 777 went missing. 'Depending on the actual track the aircraft followed, if it had headed approximately north-west this could include some–if not all–of the following countries: Thailand, Myanmar/Burma, China, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan. 'If the aircraft had gone that way, surely military primary radar in one of those countries–or several–would have picked up the signal from this unidentified aircraft, and the vigilant radar operator would have scrambled a fighter to intercept the intruder? 'Wouldn’t s/he? Or maybe not. Maybe these states’ air defences, like Malaysia’s, are not what they are cracked up to be. And maybe they wouldn’t want the rest of the world to know that.' For the critical first three days the seach was focused on the South China Sea. So when the Malaysian military reported the sighting over the the Strait of Malacca, it became clear that was the wrong search area. The missing plane, considered history's worst aviation disaster, went missing on March 8 with 239 people on board . 'Terrain masking', as illustrated here, is a technique used by pilots to avoid radar detection . Hunt: An Australian pilot scans the surface of the sea during the search operation for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 to the west of Peninsula Malaysia . Today Malaysian authorities said they were ceding control to other countries in the hunt for the airliner as they announced the search area now consists of 14 huge sections covering an area the size of Australia. Witnesses in the Maldives reported seeing what they described as a 'low-flying jumbo jet' around 6.15am. Maldivian news website Haveeru said the residents on the remote Maldives island of Kuda Huvadhoo in Dhaal Atoll said they saw a white aircraft, with red stripes across it like the planes operated by Malaysia Airlines. It would mean that MH370 continued for a further 2,000 miles flying westwards. Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn of the Royal Thai . Air Force said an unidentified aircraft was detected at 1.28am, eight . minutes after MH370'S transponder stopped communicating. He said the plane was following a twisting path, turning towards . Butterworth, a Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca. The radar . signal was infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight . number. He said he didn't know exactly when Thai . radar last detected the plane. Malaysian officials have said Flight 370 . was last detected by their own military radar at 2:14 a.m. heading toward the strait. When asked why it took so long to release the information, Montol said, 'Because we did not pay any attention to it. 'The . Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country, . so anything that did not look like a threat to us, we simply look at it . without taking actions.' Clueless?

A man stands in front of a board with messages of hope and support for the passengers of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 at the departure hall of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport . The final picture: The missing jet is pictured here in February this year above Polish airspace . He said the plane never entered Thai . airspace and that Malaysia's initial request for information in the . early days of the search was not specific. 'When . they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from . (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our . information again,' Montol said. 'It didn't take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it.' Flight . 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:40 a.m. Malaysian time and its . transponder, which allows air traffic controllers to identify and track . the airplane, ceased communicating at 1:20 a.m. Montol . said that at 1:28 a.m., Thai military radar 'was able to detect a . signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the . direction opposite from the MH370 plane,' back toward Kuala Lumpur. The search area for the plane initially focused on the South China Sea, where ships and planes spent a week searching. Pings that a satellite detected from . the plane hours after its communications went down have led authorities . to concentrate instead on two vast arcs — one into central Asia and the . other into the Indian Ocean — that together cover an expanse as big as . Australia. Thai officials said radar equipment in southern Thailand detected the plane. Malaysian officials have said the plane . might ultimately have passed through northern Thailand, but Thai Air . Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong told reporters Tuesday that the country's . northern radar did not detect it. Search: Sailors from the U.S. destroyer USS Kidd prepare to launch a helicopter in the hunt for flight MH370 . Thailand's failure to quickly share . possible information regarding the fate of the plane, and the 239 people . aboard it, may not substantially change what Malaysian officials know, . but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are . sharing their defense information, even in the name of an urgent and . mind-bending aviation mystery. With . only its own radar to go on, it took Malaysia a week to confirm that . Flight 370 had entered the strait, an important detail that led it to . change its search strategy. The U.S. Navy says that it will use long-range naval aircraft to look for the plane, and send its destroyer, the USS Kidd, back to normal duties. Australia is leading the search efforts in the southern Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, furious Chinese families today . threatened to go on hunger strike until the Malaysian government tells . them the truth about the fate of their relatives aboard the flight which . went missing en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Ten . days after the airliner vanished an hour into its flight, hundreds of . family members are still waiting for information in a Beijing hotel. Around two thirds of the 239 passengers on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are Chinese. Families . vented their pain and anger on Chinese representatives sent by the . airline to meet them on Tuesday and demanded to see the Malaysian . ambassador. 'What we want is the truth. Don't let . them become victims of politics. No matter what political party you . are, no matter how much power you have, if there isn't life, what's the . point? Where is compassion?' asked one middle-aged woman angrily. 'You're . always going back and forth. I think your government knows in their . heart why we want you to answer us. Because you're always tricking us, . telling us lies,' added one man. China . has repeatedly called on the Malaysian side to do a better job at . looking after the relatives of the Chinese passengers, and to provide . them with updated information.","MH370 spotted at 1.28am, eight minutes after it stopped communicating .

"Ebay and Amazon have been ordered to surrender tens of thousands of members’ details to the taxman as part of a crackdown on online trading. HM Revenue and Customs has issued legal notices asking for the data, including names and email addresses. Companies that do not comply promptly could be fined £300, with an additional £60 per day if they fail to respond by the end of the month. Nowhere to hide: HMRC has issued legal notices asking for the details of thousands of Amazon and Ebay sellers (posed by model) HMRC has already written to thousands of people who may not have declared all the tax they owe relating to internet sales. It hopes to raise millions of pounds by targeting online traders, who have until June 14 to come forward and benefit from a reduced penalty of 20 per cent of the tax owed. The penalty will then rise to 100 per cent, but in the worst cases traders could face prosecution. Last year Greg Allnutt, 40, an eBay user from Croydon, was jailed for 20 months for evading £430,000 of tax while selling electrical goods on eBay between 2007 and 2010. Guy Smith of tax consultancy firm Abbey Tax said HMRC’s campaign would be ‘a hammer blow to those who have traded without detection so far’. Previous targets of HMRC crackdowns include Avon ladies, Ann Summers party hosts, doctors, dentists, plumbers and those with off-shore bank accounts. The initiatives are said to have helped the taxman claw back £500million so far. A spokesman for HMRC said: ‘If you are an online seller with undeclared income, you should come forward and put your tax affairs in order before HMRC catches up with you.’ They stressed that the focus would be the sites’ 32,500 biggest traders. Ebay said it works ‘hard to ensure that businesses that trade on the platform are aware of their tax obligations’. It added: ‘We do not hesitate to share information with government agencies should there be evidence of wrongdoing. We require all sellers trading as a business on eBay to register for a business account.’ Launched in the UK in October 1999, eBay is the country’s largest online marketplace, with more than 14million active users – although only around 178,000 of these run a business or use eBay as their primary or secondary source of income. Its rival Amazon Marketplace was launched in 2000, and allows individuals and other businesses to sell items through the main Amazon website. Amazon did not respond for comment.","Companies that fail to comply face fines of £300 .

"Climate change experts have been trying for years to explain why the sea ice in Antarctica is expanding. Now scientists claim to have found the answer – global warming. They believe the paradoxical shift is caused by water melting from beneath the Antarctic ice shelves and re-freezing back on the surface. A Pod of orcas amongst the breaking sea ice, Ross Sea, Antarctica 2009. Researchers now believe the ice is increasing . The frozen sea around the South Pole . has been steadily growing, reaching a record extent in the winter of . 2010, while the Arctic ice at the north of the planet shrank to a record . low last year. Now a team from the respected Royal . Netherlands Meteorological Institute says that the fresh water melting . from the Antarctic ice sheets has a relatively low density compared to . the denser salty seawater, so it accumulates in the top layer of the . ocean during the summer months. The surface waters re-freeze during autumn and winter to spread across a greater area. The Dutch study, published yesterday . in the journal Nature Geoscience, says: ‘Sea ice around Antarctica is . increasing despite the warming global climate. This is caused by melting . of the ice sheets from below. This powerful negative feedback . counteracts Southern Hemispheric atmospheric warming.’ September 26, 2012, when ice covered more of the Southern Ocean than at any other time in the satellite record. The researchers predict the phenomenon will continue. The Earth’s poles have very different . geography. Surrounded by North America, Greenland and Eurasia, the . Arctic ice cap floats on the ocean, not land. It has lost a large amount . of its older, thicker sea ice over the last 30 years, making it more . vulnerable to the warming trend. The Antarctic, however, is a continent . circled by open waters that lets sea ice expand during the winter but . also offers less shelter during the melt season. The Dutch report notes that despite . the increase in surface ice expansion each winter, the total mass of ice . around Antarctica is continuing to shrink because of the underwater ice . melt. The study is not the first to put forward a reason for the . Antarctica effect. However, there is some scepticism about the findings. The British Antarctic Survey and Nasa believe wind in behind the rise in ice levels in the Antarctic . Paul Holland of the British Antarctic . Survey stuck to his findings in a report last year that a shift in winds . linked to climate change was blowing a layer of meltwater further out . to sea and adding to winter ice. ‘The possibility remains that the real . increase is the sum of wind-driven and meltwater-driven effects, of . course. That would be my best guess, with the meltwater effect being the . smaller of the two,’ he said. The Dutch report also speculated that a . cold layer of water created offshore may be responsible for lower than . average snowfall in Antarctica, as it cools the air above it. Cold air . can hold less moisture than warm. ‘Cool sea surface temperatures around . Antarctica could offset projected snowfall increases in Antarctica, with . implications for estimates of future sea-level rise,’ said the study. At a winter maximum in September, ice . on the sea around Antarctica covers about 7.3million square miles, . bigger than Antarctica’s land area. The scientists say the Antarctic sea ice has shown a small but significant growth of 1.9 per cent per decade since 1985.","Melted ice re-freezes faster than sea water in winter-study .

"A retired British teacher who ran a safari lodge in remote South Africa has been found beaten and stabbed to death in a brutal robbery. Police also believe that Christine Robinson may have been raped during the attack at the 125-acre Rra-Ditau Lodge, near the border with Botswana, after putting up a fierce struggle. South African police are now hunting for a farm worker who has not been seen since the murder which took place between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Christine Robinson, 59, pictured with her husband Robbie, was brutally stabbed and murdered in the lodge she ran in a remote part of South Africa . Around £3,500, which Mrs Robinson had withdrawn from her bank account to pay staff wages, is also missing. Mrs Robinson, who was originally from Liverpool, was discovered partially-clothed and rolled in a duvet in her private wing at the lodge by a member of staff. Cuts and bruises to her body indicated that she had fought back against her attacker, a police spokeswoman said. It is thought she died from a single stab wound to her neck. Last night, the 59 year old, who bought her idyllic game farm with her husband 12 years ago, was described by her niece as 'cheerful, popular and kind-hearted” who had treated her African staff 'like family'. Mrs Robinson, originally from Liverpool, was found on a private wing of the Rra-Ditau lodge by a member of staff . Lehanne Sergison, from Kent, told the Daily Mail, her aunt 'was the most wonderful woman – bubbly and full of fun, a born storyteller who talked to anyone. She was impossible to dislike and made friends easily. All her friends and family are heartbroken at hearing of her death.' Mrs Robinson had taught English at a string of International schools around the world before settling in South Africa with her husband, Robbie, in the foothills of the Waterberg mountain range, two hours north-west of Johannesburg . Mr Robinson died two years ago from cancer, but his widow decided to stay on alone at their pristine farm where she hosted guests in thatched cottages and conference facilities. A post mortem will be carried out next week. Lieutenant Colonel Ronel Otto, of the South African Police Service, confirmed a Zimbabwean worker was now being hunted in connection with the brutal murder. 'We are not ruling out the possibility that other people were involved, but at the moment this particular member of staff, who has not been seen since Mrs Robinson’s body was found, is of particular interest to us.' Attacks on farmers and their families is a serious issue in South Africa claiming an average of two lives every week, prompting the country’s Human Rights Commission to call a public hearing on the issue. Within 24 hours of Mrs Robinson’s killing, there were two other violent robberies at farms in her region of South Africa, which included attacks on three women and a baby.

"Children as young as 10 were part of a ‘criminal army’ of Roma immigrants which included 13-year-old wives ‘bought’ for up to 170,000 pounds each, a court heard today. Details of the sinister network emerged during the trial of 27 men and women aged between 19 and 55 in Nancy, eastern France. All face up to 10 years in prison after being accused of a wide range of crimes, ranging from robbery to people trafficking. The case began on the day that France's foreign minister Laurent Fabius declared . Romania and Bulgaria should not be allowed into the passport-free . Schengen zone due to security fears. Ultimately run by a 66-year-old woman, the network expected boys and girls to bring in at least 4000 pounds a month through robbing people in the street or in their homes. Accused: The house of one of the Roma families who have gone on trial in France. It is located in the town of Slavonski Brod in Croatia . It comes as Britain braces itself for an influx of Roma from Bulgaria and Romania when EU labour restrictions are eased next year. Gilles Weintz, the detective who led the enquiry into the France-based ring, said all those involved were Roma originally from Croatia. ‘We are facing an extraordinary phenomenon of burglary on an industrial scale,’ said Mr Weinz, who said the gang – made up of three clans – operated all over France, Belgium and Germany, with more than 100 robberies in 2011 alone. Male leaders ‘bought young wives’ for the cash equivalent of up to £170,000 each from other families in Croatia, and selected them especially for their stealing skills. ‘The better they were at stealing, the higher the price was,’ said Mr Weintz. ‘Young looking women also commanded higher prices because they had a better chance of passing themselves off as minors. ‘The burglaries were carried out daily all over Europe,’ he added. ‘They never stopped - for the children it was like a form of military service.’ Those running the ring were monitored via tapped phones which revealed a ‘mafia style’ network, with those in charge using their stolen money to buy upmarket properties in Slavonski Brod in Croatia. The defendants, who cannot currently be named because of legal restrictions preventing the identification of the numerous children involved, deny all the charges. French security forces prepare to evacuate caravans belonging to the Roma community at a camp in Roubaix, northern France. Their treatment has caused controversy in France . The officer cited the case of a woman . identified as Nathalie who had been bought but failed to live up to . expectations by bringing in 'only' 200,000 euros over two years. Her . family was allegedly ordered to pay back 100,000 euros but the amount . was finally reduced to 55,000 to take into account the sexual abuse she . had suffered. The . children meanwhile were expected to bring in up to 5,000 euros per month . each in the form of stolen goods that were then sold on through fences . in France and Germany, helping to finance luxury lifestyles for the clan . chiefs, some of whom owned upscale properties in Slavonski Brod in . Croatia. Their leader, the 66-year-old woman, is being tried separately. All argue that their complicated financial transactions were based on traditional Roma dowry arrangements, and that the phone tapping was illegal. Defence lawyer Alain Behr also said the current anti-Roma feeling in France meant they could not get a fair trial. 'Anti-Roma feeling': Defence lawyer warned of prejudice after French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he will ban Romania and Bulgaria from the EU's passport-free zone until they change their immigration rules . ‘I hope there will not be a judicial stigmatisation as there is currently a political stigmatisation,’ said Mr Behr. Speaking on France Inter radio today, foreign minister Laurent Fabius said France is not in favour of allowing Romania and Bulgaria into Europe's passport-free Schengen zone for now due to concerns about border security. He said: 'If there is not a change in conditions, we won't be in favour.' His comments came amid fierce debate within France's ruling coalition over the treatment of the Roma population. Some 20,000 Roma migrants from Romania and Bulgaria live in hundreds of squalid make-shift camps on the outskirts of French cities. Tensions with local communities have made Roma migration a contentious issue ahead of municipal elections next year. Romanian and Bulgarian citizens currently have the right to travel with a passport throughout the Schengen zone, which removes border controls among most EU countries as well as non-members such as Switzerland and Norway. People from the Roma community leave their camp after they were expelled by police last year . French authorities have been clamping down on the Romanian and Bulgarian gypsy camps for years . Fabius fears lax immigration laws in those countries could mean any nationality could gain French access . Temporary restrictions that imposed passport checks were put in place when the two countries joined the EU in 2007, and are due to be lifted in January. But each EU country has the right to veto the admission of a member state into the Schengen zone and a vote is expected before the end of the year. Germany said in March that it too opposed the entry of the two countries into the zone.Fabius said France was concerned about the ability of Romanian and Bulgarian authorities to ensure border security. 'People coming from outside Europe could enter Romania and Bulgaria and then freely enter the rest of Europe,' Fabius told the radio station. 'There's a problem there, we must be sure that Bulgaria and Romania have the means to verify that. 'For the moment, it strikes me that those conditions have not been met,' he said. Last week, Interior Minister Manuel Valls caused uproar in the left-wing governing coalition by saying most immigrant Roma could not be integrated into society and should go home. The far-right National Front has made the issue a top campaign theme for March's municipal elections, warning of a new influx of immigrants if Romanian and Bulgarian citizens are allowed to travel freely without passports in the Schengen zone. The Nancy trial, which involves 17 male defendants and 10 women, continues.","Young wives with good looks and stealing skills were traded for £170,000 .

"Making it rain: Serge Vorobyov, pictured, ended up getting arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after throwing $1,000 in dollar bills into the mall . A Minnesota man was only trying to spread the love when he threw $1,000 in dollar bills from the fourth floor of a mall this Black Friday. But Serge Vorobyov ended up getting arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. Vorobyov, who goes by the YouTube handle 'Serge the Car Hauler,' chucked the cash from the Mall of America rotunda in Bloomington as a choir performed 'Let it Snow' on the ground floor below. He said he tossed out the cascade of bills because he'd had a rough year, including a messy divorce, and just wanted to help make others' dreams come true on the biggest shopping day of the year. 'People think it's an evil number, I thought it was supposed to be a lucky number,' he said on YouTube video explaining the event. 'I had a really tough year. My story is that I just threw out my last thousands dollars. 'I don't have enough money for a lot of things and I'm going through a horrible divorce she even took the cat and won't tell me where it is.

"A Christian production company is waging battle against the upcoming 50 Shades of Grey movie adaption by releasing its own rival romance flick, Old Fashioned, in theaters on the same day, next Valentine's Day. 'A former frat boy and a free-spirited woman together attempt the impossible: an ""old-fashioned"" courtship in contemporary America,' reads the film's description on IMBd; and it looks set to be the very antithesis of all that 50 Shades of Grey stands for; sex, bondage, and domination. 'I wanted to tell a love story that . takes the idea of Godly romance seriously,' said Rik Swartzwelder, . writer, director and lead actor of the film, before squeezing in an apt . biblical reference: 'Opening the same weekend as Fifty Shades, there’s . definitely a David v. Goliath comparison.' Challengers: The Christian movie centers around 'a former frat boy (left) and a free-spirited woman (right) who together attempt the impossible, an ""old-fashioned"" courtship in contemporary America' To the contrary: 50 Shades of Grey tells the erotic story of Anastasia Steele, a college student played by Dakota Johnson (pictured) who is seduced by BDSM expert Christian Grey . 'We know we’re picking a fight here and that we’re more than a little outgunned,' Mr Swartzwelder writes on the movie's blog page. 'Oh well, it is what it is.' The actor-director will star opposite Elizabeth Roberts, an actress who has played the character of Marge Bernadi in Days of Our Lives, and this year, had a minor role in Bones. Although Mr Swartzwelder clearly seeks to appeal to die-hard Christians with his conservative tale, there seems to be room too for those who have perhaps swayed off the path of Godly righteousness. '[The story], without apology, explores the possibility of a higher standard in relationships; yet, is also fully aware of just how fragile we all are and doesn’t seek to heap guilt upon those of us that have made mistakes,' he explains . Coming soon: 'I wanted to tell a love story that takes the idea of Godly romance seriously,' says Rik Swartzwelder (right), the writer, director, and lead actor in the film, also starring Elizabeth Roberts (left) Going to head-to-head with the multimillion dollar blockbuster that is 50 Shades of Grey - which sees Dakota Johnson play the role of Anastasia Steele and hunky Calvin Klein model Jamie Dornan play Christian Grey - Mr Swartzwelder is comfortable being the underdog. 'We’re hopeful that there are others out there who desire more from love - and . the movies - than objectification or domination' 'They will have more screens, more money, more hype,' he correctly identifies. 'But we’re hopeful that we are not alone in our belief that there are others out there who desire more from love - and the movies - than objectification or domination.' The film is backed by Christian film finance firm Workting Title Agency and distributed by Freestyle, reports The Independent, and, according to co-president Mark Border will be: 'The first faith-based theatrical release to specifically target the underserved Christian singles audience.' Steamy: Christian Grey's character in 50 Shades of Grey is played by former Calvin Klein model Jamie Dornan (pictured) Big budget: 'They will have more screens, more money, more hype,' Mr Swartzwelder notes of his movie nemesis, pictured, a scene starring Dakota as Anastasia . Rivals: While the 50 Shades of Grey trailer (pictured) is so far the most-watched movie preview of 2014, Old Fashioned hopes to succeed in its mission as 'the first faith-based theatrical release to specifically target the underserved Christian singles audience' The same team also partnered on another faith-based movie which hit theaters in March, entitled God's Not Dead, which sees a devout Christian college freshman battle it out with his aggressively atheist philosophy professor in a quest to prove the existence of God. God's Not Dead was a roaring success and took more than $60million at box offices worldwide; made on a budget of only $2million. Leading film critics unanimously panned the movie however, labeling it 'sick,' 'ham-fisted,' 'angry,' and 'dismal.' Even if Old Fashioned does prove as lucrative as God's Not Dead, its unlikely to touch its nemesis. The 50 Shades of Grey trailer has already been watched on YouTube over 19 million times so far, making it the most-watched film preview of 2014.",Both films will hit theaters next Valentine's Day .

"The killer ash tree disease has now been found at nearly 300 sites as conservation groups slammed the Government’s response as ‘too little, too late’. Ministers yesterday unveiled a strategy to tackle ash dieback, and claimed it caught officials unaware earlier this year when the first case was revealed in Britain. The number of infected sites is now 291 - and the number has doubled in just one month. Lethal: Ash dieback, pictured, has been found at nearly 300 sites - double the number of sites in one month . But campaigners, who raised fears . that Britain was at risk from the infection from imported trees four . years ago, said the plan did not go far enough and would ‘surrender the . landscape’ to ash dieback. All 80 million ash trees, Britain’s . third most abundant type and a staple of the timber industry, are at . risk from the pest which has wiped out 90 per cent of ash trees in . Denmark and could be as devastating as Dutch elm disease was in the . 1970s. The plan announced by Environment . Secretary Owen Paterson is intended to reduce the spread of the disease, . as Government scientific advisers claim it cannot now be eradicated. It is believed to have arrived on imported young ash trees, and blown across as spores from the Continent. Mr Paterson announced more research . into how the infection spreads, a ‘risk register’ for infected trees and . improved security measures at border controls. Experts will locate trees which have genetic resistance to the fungus which could be used to ‘restructure’ infected forests. He said: ‘We need to radically . rethink how we deal with the threats to our trees. While the science . tells us it won’t be possible to eradicate this disease, we mustn’t give . up on British ash. The plan I have set out shows our determination to . slow the spread and minimise the impact.’ Dr Simon Pryor, of the National . Trust, said the actions in the plan were paltry, and he accused the . government of ‘surrendering’ by backing out of testing all recently . planted trees and destroying infected ones. The National Trust has destroyed 3,000 recently planted ash saplings on its land after five outbreaks. He said: ‘The limited actions and . weak commitments set out in the plan will not be enough to achieve the . aim of controlling the spread of the disease. It’s far too little, too . late. ‘Our collective knowledge of this . disease is limited, and it is good to see a workshop on research . priorities is being proposed, but we are concerned that this is entirely . focused on breeding resistance rather than on techniques that could . reduce the rate of spread.’ Ash dieback is caused by the chalara . fraxinea fungs and is rife in northern Europe. It was discovered in . Britain for the first time in a nursery in Buckinghamshire. Devastation: The disease is hitting one of the most common types of tree in Britain and the impact is evident on the infected ash leaf, right . The symptoms are small discoloured . patches on the trees stem which develop into bigger lesions and the . leaves wilting and young trees die quickly. The first outbreak in the wild was in . woodland in Norfolk in October, and it has now been found at 155 mature . woodlands, 119 recently planted areas and 17 nurseries nationwide. Professor Ian Boyd, chief scientist . at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the disease had caught the UK off guard. He said: ‘It simply fell . below the radar to be honest. It’s very difficult thing to identify.’ Mr Paterson told the House of Commons . last month that he would allocate money for an ‘early warning system’ made up of trained volunteers from groups such as the Woodland Trust to . ‘play a really important role’ in monitoring tree health. But Woodland Trust chief executive . Sue Holden said the plan was ‘disappointing’ especially as Britain faces . a growing numbers of woodland pests and diseases due to global trade. She said: ‘There is a distinct lack . of political interest in supporting the UK’s natural infrastructure . despite the Government’s own figures valuing the benefits of our woods . and trees at around £1.2bn a year. It is clear the Government is playing . scientific catch up, completely unprepared for the crisis our ash trees . are now facing.’","Lethal ash dieback found at nearly 300 sites .

"A killer who strangled two fellow prisoners in order to ensure his execution used his final moments while strapped in an electric chair to tell witnesses to ‘kiss my a**’ moments before he died at 9.08pm on Wednesday. Robert Gleason Jr. uttered the vulgar phrase in Irish Gaelic, according to Larry Traylor, a . spokesman for the Virginia Department of Corrections, while adding 'Put me on the highway going to Jackson and call my Irish buddies. ... God bless,' before a leather strap was tightened over his face. The 42-year-old was first strapped to the wooded electric chair at his chest, arms and ankles, while seen occasionally smiling, winking and nodding at his spiritual adviser who sat in the witness area, the Richmond Times Dispatch reports. Executed: Convicted killer Robert Gleason Jr., died in an electric chair in Virginia on Wednesday night after he vowed to keep killing unless he was put to death . Farewell: This is the electric chair at the Greensville Correctional Center in Jarratt, Virginia where Robert Gleason Jr. was executed on Wednesday . That spiritual adviser, Tim 'Bam Bam' Spradling, determined it was Gleason's way of signaling that he was ready to go. After finishing his biting last words, a wide leather strap was pulled across his eyes and mouth. A center hole allowed room for his nose. Next a brine-soaked sea sponge - soaked to better conduct electricity throughout the body leading to a faster and less painful death - was strapped to his right calf before a second was to the top of his head. Without the sponge the electricity administered would disperse all over the body, causing the body to cook in a far more agonizing way, as depicted in the film adaptation of Stephen King's novel, The Green Mile. Power cables were then connected to Gleason's head and leg before a key was turned into a wall, activating the system. With . the last push from a button from behind a one-way window, the first . cycle of electricity was activated, sending approximately 1,800 volts at . 7.5 amps for 30 seconds before it was decreased to 250 volts at 1.5 . amps for the next 60 seconds. Condemned Virginia inmates can choose between lethal injection and electrocution, and Gleason is the first inmate to choose electrocution since 2010 . Last stop: Gleason was executed at the pictured Greensville Correctional Center in Jarratt, Virginia at 9pm on Wednesday just moments after telling witnesses to 'kiss my a**' Conductor: As seen in a scene from the movie The Green Mile, a soaked . sponge, left, is placed on the inmate's head to better transmit the . electricity, though in the film, right, a guard uses a dry sponge, agonizingly cooking the man instead . After . repeating the cycles for five minutes, allowing momentary gaps in . between, a physician checked his heartbeat, placing a stethoscope to his . chest but heard nothing. He was the first executed in the U.S. this year and the first to choose to die by electrocution since 2010. In Virginia and nine other states, inmates can choose between electrocution and lethal injection. Robert Charles Towery (2012): 'I love my family. Potato, potato, potato.' Towery was executed in Arizona after strangling his robbery victim Mark Jones in his Phoenix home in 1991. Mark Stroman (2011): ‘Let’s do this damn thing’ Stroman was executed in Texas after he went on a shooting spree following the 9/11 attacks, killing three people he thought were Muslims. Thomas J. Grasso (1995): ‘I did not get my Spaghetti-O’s, I got spaghetti. I want the press to know this’ Grasso was executed in Oklahoma for a double murder. His last meal included a can of Franco-American Spaghetti-O’s. John Wayne Gacy (1994): ‘Kiss my ass! You’ll never find the rest’ The ‘Killer Clown’ was convicted of the rapes and murders of 33 men between 1972 and 1978. George Appel (1928): ‘Well, gentlemen… you are about to see a baked Appel' Moments before his execution, he also said, ‘Damn, no power outage.’ He was executed via electric chair for robbery and the murder of a New York City police officer. Edward H. Rulloff (1870): ‘I’d like to be in hell in time for dinner’ Known as the ‘Man of Two Lives’ for his paradoxical lives of respected educator and swindler, he was hanged for the murder of his wife and daughter. Gleason was serving life in prison without parole for a 2007 murder when he admitted to using strips from bed sheets to bind and strangle Harvey Watson, a 63-year-old inmate at Virginia's Wallens Ridge State Prison in May 2009. According to court documents, Gleason told authorities he timed the murder to coincide with the second anniversary of the previous homicide he carried out. He admitted to tying Watson's hands without a struggle after telling him he had come up with a way for the two to escape. Court records show he taunted Watson before he strangled him by pressing a urine-soaked sponge onto his face and a sock into his mouth. Gleason attacked another inmate in July 2010 at the maximum-security Red Onion State Prison while he waited to be sentenced for killing Watson, according to court records. Gleason said he asked fellow inmate . Aaron A. Cooper, 26, to try on a 'religious necklace,' which Gleason . threaded through a wire fence separating the two while they were in . solitary recreation pens. Gleason testified that he mercilessly choked . Cooper through the fence 'till he turned purple,' waited for his skin . color to return to normal, then choked him to death. According to a security camera that filmed the horrific incident, Cooper was left unwatched by guards for roughly 75 minutes after placed inside his cell. Cooper's mother has sued the Virginia . prison system, accusing prison authorities of giving Gleason the . opportunity to murder her son after Gleason told guards he planned to . kill again. After reaffirming that vow, Gleason explained the situation as . being that it's not because he wants to die, but rather because he . knows he will kill again if he's not executed. He wanted to be put . to death despite attempts by his former court-appointed attorneys to . halt the execution at the Greensville Correctional Center and have him undergo a mental competency evaluation. The attorneys had argued the time he . spent in solitary confinement on death row left him unable to make . rational decisions, a claim authorities rejected. During court proceedings, Gleason . indicated he intended to keep killing unless he was given the death . penalty, according to the state Attorney General's Office. Gleason told a . federal judge earlier this month he did not want a lawyer and called . for his execution to proceed. His former lawyers said Gleason . suffered from mental illness and had made several suicide attempts. Their final effort to halt the execution to allow for an evaluation of . his mental competency was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court on . Wednesday. Third victim: Aaron Cooper, a carjacker with gang ties who's seen left in 2001, was strangled to death in 2010 by Gleason using this white noose, right, that was slipped through a wire fence . Murder: Gleason strangled Cooper at the Red Onion State Prison, pictured, before video surveillance revealed Cooper was left unchecked in a pen next to Gleason for approximately 75 minutes . He told The Associated Press he deserved to die for what he did. 'Why . prolong it? The end result's gonna be the same,' Gleason said from . death row in his thick Boston accent in one of numerous interviews he's . given to The Associated Press over three years. 'The death part don't bother me. This has been a long time coming. It's called karma.' Gleason . claimed he's killed others – perhaps dozens more – but he has refused . to provide details. He claims he's different from the other men on . Virginia's death row for one important reason: he only kills criminals. Watson was serving life for killing one man and injuring two others. Cooper was a carjacker with gang ties. 'I ain't saying I'm a better person . for killing criminals, but I've never killed innocent people,' Gleason . said. 'I killed people that's in the same lifestyle as me, and they . know, hey, these things can happen.' Gleason said he only requested death in order to keep a promise to a loved one that he wouldn't kill again. He . said doing so will allow him to teach his children, including two young . sons, what can happen if they follow in his footsteps. 'I wasn't there as a father and I'm hoping that I can do one last good thing,' he said. 'Hopefully, this is a good thing.' On Wednesday he reportedly had a last meal, but chose not to release the details of the dish publicly. Old Sparky: Auburn Correctional Facility's original electric chair is seen . The electric chair was the brainchild of an 1881 New York state . committee charged with finding a more humane method of execution to . replace hanging. The first inmate to be put to death in one was William . Kemmler in 1890 in New York's Auburn Prison. It took two attempts . running current through Kemmler to finally kill him, and witnesses . described the horrific spectacle as 'far worse than hanging.' After some . refining, the chair became the most popular method of execution from . the early 1900s until the 1980s when it was overtaken by lethal . injection. The last use of the chair was in March 2010, when Virginia . inmate and convicted murderer and rapist Paul Warner Powell chose it . over lethal injection.","Robert Gleason Jr., 42, was serving life in prison without parole for a 2007 murder when he strangled his first inmate using bedsheets in 2009 .

"An aspiring actress quit her job as a waitress on Monday after claiming a customer crossed the line and grabbed her butt, and now she's penned a biting account of the inappropriate incident. New York waitress Laura Ramadei made sure to jot down the name of the man she claims felt her up from the information on his credit card, and has identified him as hedge-fund manager Brian H Lederman. Lederman, a 57-year-old married man, has since hit back at Ramadei - saying he has 'grabbed plenty of girls' a**es' but not hers. In a long post on her Facebook page, Ramadei described the incident that happened this week while she was working a shift at SoHo restaurant Lucky Strike. Inappropriate: Aspiring actress Laura Ramadei (left) claims hedge-fund manager Brian Lederman (right) grabbed her butt while she was working a shift as a waitress at a New York restaurant this week . Family-friendly establishment: On Monday, Ramadei gave her two weeks notice at Lucky Strike, the SoHo restaurant where she worked . She says Lederman came into the family-friendly restaurant around 6:30pm with a friend a ordered Stoli vodka on the rocks. 'When I asked you and your companion if you'd be eating, or needing anything else from me, you put your hand - ever so gently - ON MY A** and asked if you could take me ""to go"". 'When I immediately stepped away and said ""Sorry, what?"" you probably gathered that I was and am not receptive of such advances from customers... 'I was wearing a loose-fitting, long sleeve shirt, jeans, and no makeup...so I'm not sure where the confusion arose as to what kind of service you were being provided,' Ramadei wrote. The waitress, who helps run an independent theater company, says she's worked as a bartender for five years since graduating with honors from NYU. During those years, she says she has been the victim of numerous inappropriate comments from customers but that it was this incident that inspired her to quit the service industry for good. 'I can't tell you how many times people have treated me horribly and I've memorized or photographed the names from their credit cards, fantasizing about internet revenge. But every time I've been tempted in the past (even after verbal attacks, physical affronts, or sexual harassment) I've stopped myself and let it go. 'So congratulations, Brian! You've done it! You broke this tired a** camel's back,' Ramadei wrote. She adds that while she is shaming him with the post, she didn't draft it as an attack. Money man: According to LinkedIn, Lederman is a hedge-fund manager for Swiss Performance Management and Fiduciary . 'Maybe - just maybe - via the intimately connected internet world, my post will reach you, and you'll learn something about how hurtful and upsetting a small comment or gesture might be,' she says. Not much: Lederman also only tipped $2 on his $15.24 bar tab . That post did read Lederman, but it doesn't seem to have moved him much. The infuriated finance worker spoke with the New York Post to deny he ever touched the waitress. 'I’ve grabbed plenty of girls’ a**es in my life,' Lederman said, 'But I’ve never grabbed hers.' While he admits making the comment about taking her 'to go' - he says it was a joke and he was only kidding. Now, Lederman vows Ramadei will never get a service-industry job again. 'That f****** c***, for her to do something like that is pretty ridiculous,' he said. 'I will make sure she doesn’t get another job in New York City. I know everybody: the bar owners, the club owners—that’s a terrible thing to write about somebody.' And to add insult to injury, Lederman only tipped the waitress $2 dollars on a $15.24 bar tab - a little less than 15 per cent which is considered the bare minimum for restaurants.","Aspiring actress Laura Ramadei says hedge-fund manager Brian Lederman grabbed her butt while she was serving him at a restaurant recently .

"For many, Hollywood actors and bodybuilders among them, anabolic steroids have become a regular part of life. But with side-effects that range from excess body hair to liver damage, using them can result in serious health issues as well as bigger muscles - as the stars of a new documentary fronted by former reality TV star Jodie Marsh prove. Among the performance-enhancing drug users to feature on Jodie Marsh On...Steroids, is former barmaid Candice Armstrong, 28, from Walthamstow in London, whose steroid abuse has effectively turned her into a man. Scroll down for video . Candice (left) before she started taking anabolic steroids, which led to her developing facial hair, acne, and various other male characteristics, including a one-inch penis. Candice (right) as she is now . Irreversible: Candice Armstrong's steroid abuse has left her with male characteristics such as facial hair . Insults: Candice is the target of comments on the street because of her looks and has to wear men's clothes . Once a slender, pretty blonde, Candice is now a hulking brunette with muscles that wouldn't look out of place on Arnold Schwarzenegger and body hair that sprouts from her back, chest and upper lip. Candice had no intention of becoming so masculine when she began taking the drug, but says that it's too late for her to stop. 'No, it wasn't my plan,' she tells Marsh in a scene from the documentary. 'You could argue . that when I wanted big arms and broad shoulders, a bigger back and small . hips, that that was a masculine look but I didn't consciously decide I . want to change from a woman into a man.' The side effects have been severe. Along with excess body hair and acne, her clitoris has swelled so much, it has become a mini penis. 'That has gone significantly bigger, yes,' she reveals. 'About an . inch [long] and it's shaped like a little penis. It looks like a little penis, . you can roll back the foreskin...' Her breasts have also suffered and now hang lifeless from her hugely overdeveloped pectoral muscles. Dangerous: Her steroid use means Candice is at risk of heart problems and even liver failure . Surprisingly, Candice is sanguine. 'They've gone empty and they're not particularly nice but I'm cool with that - they were never my best feature anyway.' What's more, she has no intention of putting an end to her steroid use. 'I think it would do more harm than . good,' she explains. 'I'd lose all the muscles but I wouldn't lose all the masculine . qualities like the facial hair and the deep voice... It doesn't really . go back. 'If I was to try and reverse that, I'd need the same sort of . procedures as a male becoming a woman.' Despite her drastically altered appearance, Candice says the pros outweigh the cons and have allowed her to do something else she loves - a drag act. 'It's opened doors and enabled me to . develop myself the way I want to,' she says. 'It's given the opportunity to . live out one of my dreams. I've started doing a bit of drag and I love . it. I've always wanted to do a bit of drag!' She adds: 'If I get called a tranny and a faggot when I walk out on the street anyway, I think why not make something of it!' Addiction: According to Candice, things would be worse if she stopped because she would lose her muscles . Muscles: Jodie Marsh has become a champion bodybuilder without resorting to steroid abuse . Shocking though Candice's appearance is, she's by no means alone in her abuse of anabolic steroids. According to veteran personal trainer Happy Hill, who helped Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Philippe bulk up for roles, up to 20 percent of Tinsel-town's leading men are using performance-enhancing drugs to get a buff body. Another elite trainer, Mark Twight who trains Man of Steel star Henry Cavill, has spoken out against the use of steroids. 'The guy who uses steroids and admits to it earns more respect from me than the guy who uses but insists he doesn't and wants his fans to believe he did things the hard way,' says Twight. While lying to fans isn't particularly edifying, worse are the dangerous effects steroid use can have on the star's body. One man who knows this all too well is former stuntman and bodybuilder, Ed 'Spyk' Gheur, who lives with his wife in East Sussex. 'The thing . with steroids is that it messes with your mind more than anything,' says the softly-spoken muscleman. Drugs: Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone have both confessed to using anabolic steroids . Man of Real Steel: Henry Cavill bulked up 100 percent naturally for his role in the 2013 blockbuster . 'It makes you feel invincible and you think the more you take, the . bigger you're going to be, the faster you're going to be - and that's . what's so dangerous about them.' But for Gheur, the consequences would prove to be more terrifying still. 'One . day, I felt like I had a pain stabbing through my heart and I shouted . to my wife to call an ambulance,' he remembers. 'She found me on the kitchen floor. I . was ice cold, had no pulse and I was clinically dead. She called the . police and said my husband's dead on the floor and they arrived with an . ambulance like they always do. 'The paramedics put an adrenaline . needle through my heart to get it pumping long enough to get me to the . operating theatre, and when I got there, they opened me up and my entire aorta [main artery] . had exploded.' The reason for his terrifying collapse: steroid use. 'I went into a coma for six weeks and I thought my life was over,' he adds. 'I had thought I was invincible.'

"Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told House Ways and Means Committee members on Wednesday that she expects health insurance rates to increase as the Affordable Care Act takes full effect. 'I think premiums are likely to go up,' she conceded under questioning, 'but go up at a slower pace' than they have already under Obamacare. President Obama famously promised in 2008 and 2009 that his health insurance overhaul plan would lower the cost of health care for an average family by $2,500 per year. And as a March 31 deadline approaches, the date when Americans will face fines if they don't have medical insurance, Sebelius told the panel that there will be 'no delay' in enforcing that so-called individual mandate.

A frustrated Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius fended off tough questions from Republicans who are still eager to cripple President Barack Obama's healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act . 'How is that fair?' demanded Rep. Kevin Brady (R), talking about the administration's Obamacare delays affecting big businesses, but not individuals and families . Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille said during a conference call on Tuesday that 'we have no plans to extend the open enrollment period' that began amid fits and starts on October 1. 'In fact, we don't actually have the statutory authority to extend the open enrollment period in 2014,' she said. On Wednesday, Republican Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp asked Sebelius if she agreed. 'I haven’t seen their statements,' she replied, despite having been on the conference call, 'but there is no delay beyond March 31.' Republicans in Congress have castigated the Obama administration for failing to delay the individual mandate, even as it has made more than 35 changes to the Affordable Care Act, including some that defy date-specific deadlines in the written in the law's text. One of those changes was a year-long delay in the employer mandate, which requires companies with 50 or more employees to certify that their workers are covered by medical insurance plans that meet Obamacare's strict minimum standards. 'If you delayed this law because it’s not workable for businesses, why aren’t you delaying this law because it’s not workable for our families?' blasted Texas GOP Rep. Kevin Brady during Wednesday's hearing. 'How is that fair?' Georgia Rep. Tom Price demanded to know how many Obamacare enrollees have paid for their insurance plans, but Sebelius insisted 'I don't know that' Sebelius appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee in a hearing about HHS's budget request for 2015 . Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer lashed out at HHS for its insistence that it is prohibited from delaying for individuals what it has already relayed for large companies. 'It is puzzling that Secretary Sebelius is now concerned with a lack of statutory authority when it comes to delaying the individual mandate,' Fischer said in a statement. 'The administration has already issued nearly two dozen Obamacare delays, including those for big business and the president’s political allies.' Fischer has introduced a bill that would explicitly give the White House the power to delay that individual mandate. In your face: Nebraska GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has crafted a bill that would give HHS the authority to push back the individual mandate deadline as far as it likes . House Republicans are slated to vote this week on a similar bill, but the measure would face a certain veto at the White House. Sebelius also insisted that she doesn't know how many Obamacare enrollees have paid for coverage and are actually insured. 'I can’t tell you because I don’t know that,' she told Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price. The Obama administration trumpeted new numbers on Tuesday showing that 4.2 million Americans have selected medical insurance policies during the open enrollment period . But a MailOnline analysis showed that in the seven states which have published both enrollment and payment numbers, insurers haven't seen payments from 21 per cent of those who have signed up. If that percentage were to hold true nationally, HHS's boast of 4.2 million enrollments would shrink by 900,000. Camp, a Michigan Republican, said Wednesday that the Affordable Care Act 'is not working as it was promised. And yet, the president’s budget doubles down on this law, requesting another $1.8 billion for its implementation.' Democrats, however – including President Obama – are insisting that the law is performing as well as it was expected to. Rep. Sander Levin, another Michigander who is the Democrats' ranking member on Ways and Means, charged that 'Republicans are so invested in making the Affordable Care Act a failure that they are blinded by the successes staring them in the face.'","The HHS secretary faced a hostile House Ways and Means panel on Wednesday .
She conceded that health insurance rates will be higher next year, but suggested that they will rise 'at a slower pace' than they have so far .
But despite delaying fines and penalties for businesses, she said there would be 'no delay' for enforcing the Obamacare law against individuals .

"Kirsty Mitchell's late mother Maureen was an English teacher who spent her life inspiring generations of children with imaginative stories and plays. Following Maureen's death from a brain tumour in 2008, Kirsty channelled her grief into her passion for photography. She retreated behind the lens of her camera and created Wonderland, an ethereal fantasy world. The photographic series began as a small summer project but grew into an inspirational creative journey. 'Real life became a difficult place to deal with, and I found myself retreating further into an alternative existence through the portal of my camera,' said the artist. Kirsty Mitchell has dedicated her Wonderland photographic series to the memory of her late mother, Maureen, who lost her life to a brain tumour in 2008 . 'This escapism grew into the concept of creating an unexplained storybook without words, dedicated to her [my mother], that would echo the fragments of the fairytales she read to me constantly as a child.' Kirsty, 36, who has a background in fashion and costume design, collaborated with hair and make-up artist Elbie Van Eeden. Both were in full time jobs so they spent evenings and weekends creating props, wigs, and sets on a shoestring budget and shot in the woodlands surrounding Kirsty's home in Surrey. Kirsty developed a deep bond and respect for the locations in which she was working and strove, through her pictures, to 'remind others of their forgotten magic and beauty'. She became fascinated with pockets of wild flowers such as the bluebells that would appear for only a few brief weeks of the year. In some cases, she would wait a full 12 months so she could shoot costumes matched to the vivid colours of nature. 'All the characters came to me in my dreams,' she explained, but she delighted in the chance to step into the scenes for real: 'after all, it's not often you get to stand beside an eight foot princess in the rain, or witness the dawn with a dancing circus girl on stilts!' The resulting images looked so hyper-real that it was assumed that they were created in Photoshop. Many people believed the photographs were shot all around the world, when in reality they were taken in locations within short drives of her Surrey home. So Kirsty began to write diary accounts and blog behind-the-scenes shots about the creation of each photograph. 'My aim was to portray time passing, an unsaid journey through four seasons, incorporating every colour in the rainbow. As things progressed, her costumes became more elaborate with the props and new characters often taking up to five months to create. 'The project blossomed into our own private playground,' she said. Her three year labour of love is now almost complete and there are plans for an exhibition and accompanying book: 'I just know that the day I see my mother’s name printed on the inside cover of the Wonderland book, it will feel like I have finally fulfilled my promise to myself and her precious memory.'

"Angelina Jolie was made an honorary dame during a private audience with the Queen today in recognition of her campaigning against sexual violence. The Hollywood actress, 39, was presented with the Insignia of an Honorary Dame Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George at a reception at Buckingham Palace. The monarch herself received Oscar-winning Jolie, who starred as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider, Mr and Mrs Smith, and Changeling, and who was named by Forbes as Hollywood's highest paid actress. The actress was accompanied to the Palace by her husband, Brad Pitt, and their children, sources told MailOnline, and they were all introduced to the Queen, although they did not have official pictures taken. Scroll down for video . Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie was made an honorary Dame by the Queen in recognition of her work against sexual violence . Jolie, 39, also known as Mrs Brad Pitt, was recognised for her work in this year's Queen's birthday honours . The actress was given her DCMG during a private midday audience with the monarch in the 1844 room at Buckingham Palace . The Honorary Dame Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George was presented to Jolie in London today . A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The audience itself between Miss Jolie and the Queen was private. Her Majesty presented her with the insignia in its box. Mr Pitt and the rest of the family were introduced to the Queen afterwards, however.' As an American citizen, it is highly unusual that Jolie has received an honour from Britain. Foreigners are only occasionally awarded them – there was an honorary knighthood for Bob Geldof, who is Irish, after Live Aid. It is also unusual for a damehood to be bestowed upon someone so young.  The honour is generally bestowed later in life, after a recipient has earned a lower honour such as an OBE or a CBE. Because she is a foreign citizen Jolie may not be addressed as Dame, though she can use the initials DCMG after her name, but received the award on an honorary basis for her work at trying to stamp out rape in war zones. She was recognised in the Diplomatic Service and Overseas Birthday 2014 Honours list and received the honorary damehood (DCMG) for services to UK foreign policy and the campaign to end war-zone sexual violence. The award was first announced in June during the week when Jolie was co-chairing the End Sexual Violence in Conflict (ESVC) global summit in London with then foreign secretary, William Hague. Honour: The Queen herself received the Oscar-winning actress in a private audience at Buckingham Palace today . Travelling in style: The actress and her husband Brad Pitt touched down in a private jet in London yesterday, ahead of today's ceremoy . The other day job: Jolie, whose films include Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, above, and Mr and Mrs Smith, is Hollywood's highest paid actress . Jolie pictured arriving at the sexual violence summit she organised with then Foreign Secretary William Hague, centre, and Brad Pitt . The actress was accompanied to the Palace by her husband, Brad Pitt, and their six children, five of whom are pictured above . Her humanitarian work  runs parallel to her Hollywood career and bringing up her six children with actor Brad Pitt, three of whom are adopted. Jolie has been described by US Secretary of State John Kerry as a 'fierce and fearless advocate' and he said her dedication to campaigning could overtake her successful film career as her lasting legacy. Palace aides chose not to make public details of the audience beforehand but released a series of stills of the Queen meeting the Queen of Hollywood later. The audience took place in the 1844 room, named in honour of the 1844 State Visit of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I. In a statement Buckingham Palace said: 'Ms Angelina Jolie was received by The Queen today when Her Majesty presented her with the Insignia of an Honorary Dame Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George. 'His Excellency the Hon Paul de Jersey was received in audience by The Queen and kissed hands upon his appointment as Governor of Queensland.' When her damehood was announced, Jolie said: 'To receive an honour related to foreign policy means a great deal to me, as it is what I wish to dedicate my working life to. The Queen also received Paul de Jersey, who was appointed Governor of Queensland, and his wife, Kaye . 'Working on the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative and with survivors of rape is an honour in itself.  I know that succeeding in our goals will take a lifetime, and I am dedicated to it for all of mine.' Honorary damehoods and knighthoods are conferred by the Queen, on the advice of the Foreign Secretary, on those who have made an important contribution to relations between their country and Britain. Previous recipients include include U2 frontman Bono, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and veteran broadcaster Terry Wogan. Jolie is co-founder with William Hague of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) and she is also special envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Building on her long-term humanitarian work for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), she has been at the forefront of the initiative to highlight and seek justice for the plight of some of the most vulnerable people on the planet - the victims of sexual violence in conflict. A film Jolie made - In The Land Of Blood And Honey - brought her and Mr Hague together, leading to the ESVC summit at the ExCel exhibition centre in London's Docklands in June. Jolie has said she was 'very moved' that the 2011 film, which is set in Bosnia during the conflict and explores the issue of women suffering from sexual violence, was responded to by Mr Hague. In 1995, Angelina married Hackers co-star Jonny Lee Miller, wearing black leather trousers and a white top with her groom's name reportedly scribbled in her own blood. The marriage lasted a year, after which he went on to date Kate Moss among others, while Jolie had her first openly gay relationship, a brief fling with actress Jenny Shimizu, in 1998. In 2000, Jolie married Academy Award-winning actor Billy Bob Thornton in Las Vegas. Throughout their relationship, they were said to wear vials of each other's blood on matching necklaces. Previous loves: Husband number one was British actor, Jonny Lee Miller, in 1995, left, followed by Billy Bob Thornton in 2000 . That same year, Jolie caused a stir when she and her producer brother, James Haven, shared a passionate kiss at the Oscars after she won the award for Girl, Interrupted. Her marriage to Thornton lasted just three years, and after they divorced one of his former wives claimed they split because Thornton did not share Jolie's desire for children. The actress adopted her first child, Cambodian-born Maddox, in 2002 when he was seven months old, and in 2005 she adopted Zahara, a six-month-old little girl from Ethiopia. Also in 2005 Jolie was involved in a scandal when it was claimed she was the reason for the divorce of Brad Pitt, then her co-star in the film Mr & Mrs Smith, and Jennifer Aniston.  Jolie repeatedly denied the suggestion and did not comment publicly on their relationship until January 2006 when she announced she was pregnant with their first child. Mr Right: Jolie co-starred with Brad Pitt in the 2005 film Mr & Mrs Smith, and announced she was pregnant by him the following year . Shiloh Pitt was born in 2006, and the following year the couple dubbed 'Brangelina' adopted Pax, a four-year-old boy from Vietnam.  In 2008, Jolie gave birth to twins, a girl named Vivienne and a boy named Knox. In 2012, Jolie co-founded the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with then-Foreign Secretary, William Hague, after Hague saw Jolie's 2012 film about Bosnian rape camps, where women were kept prisoner and only released when they were pregnant, Land of Blood and Honey. Last year the actress announced in a New York Times article  that she had a preventative double mastectomy because she carries the 'faulty' gene BRCA1, which sharply increases her risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The month after she underwent eight hours of surgery, removing the breast tissue and replacing it with a temporary filler, Jolie made a humanitarian trip to the Congo with British Foreign Secretary William Hague as part of a UN initiative. She reportedly fainted in a bathroom during the trip. In April she visited a Women In The World summit in New York, before flying to London later that month to attend the G8 meeting, before having reconstructive breast surgery. After learning she carried the BRCA1 gene Jolie, whose mother Marcheline died of ovarian cancer, took the decision to undergo a hysterectomy next year. Jolie married Pitt in the south of France this summer in an Atelier Versace dress decorated with drawings by her young children.","The 39-year-old actress and star of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider had a private midday audience with the monarch today .

"Young widow: Chanel Reynolds has set up a website helping people to get their affairs in order to in case they unexpectedly die . A young widow has set up a website helping people to get their affairs in order in case they unexpectedly die. Get Your S*** Together was the brainchild of Chanel Reynolds, 42, who felt after her husband was killed in an accident, the grieving process was made more traumatic by financial worries. The website helps users to prepare for the unexpected by asking them to detail everything from email passwords to bank account codes. It also offers practical advice telling parents to consider who would look after their children if they died. 'The trauma and grief are enough to . completely level you – and yet, the fear about having our wills drafted . but not signed, not knowing how much life insurance we had, not knowing . the password to his phone so I could call his family, etc. – were often . the things that pushed me over the edge,' she explains on her website. Ms Reynolds' husband Jose Hernando, 43, a Flash developer, was killed in 2009 after being hit by a van near their Seattle home. 'He was set on going for a quick training ride before his last bike race of the season. I wanted him to go to a dinner party with me and our 5-year old instead,' she writes on the website. 'Our last moment together, he was being goofy and adorable, wanting me to kiss him before he left. I refused, twice. I was mad. He tried one last time and I couldn’t help smile at him and kiss him back. 'My last words to him were, “Ok, I’ll kiss you, but I’m still mad at you.” Scroll down for video . Killed: Ms Reynold's husband Jose Hernando, 43, a Flash developer, was killed in 2009 after being hit by a van near their Seattle home . Tragic accident: After Mr Hernando's medical support was withdrawn at the hospital, Ms Reynold's explained that her grief was worsened by her immediate panic about what she needed to do next as a single mother . Chanel Reynolds advises on her website: 'Here’s something you can do this evening over a glass of wine. 'Take . one hour to jot down all of the passwords, numbers and other bits of . information that you take for granted every day, but without which daily . life would come grinding to a halt. 'This document will save you time at least a few times a year when you . can easily dig up a pin or account number. 'Worst case scenario, you’ll . save your family hours of misery and stress spent calling around trying . to clean up your piles of unsorted paperwork. 'Take it from me. It is . nothing short of punishing to call credit companies and government . offices saying over and over again, “My husband died and I am trying to . locate/get access to xxxx.' Source: Get Your S*** Together . Twenty minutes later her husband collided with a van and which 'decimated his upper spine and caused an immediate traumatic cardiac arrest. Technically, he died on the scene.' After medical support was withdrawn at the hospital, Ms Reynolds explains that her grief was worsened by her immediate panic about what she needed to do next as a single mother. 'All of that extra stress and pain could have easily been avoided with a few hours of organization and follow through. I don’t want anyone to suffer the same way,' she explains. Ms Reynolds was only just saved from financial ruin due to life insurance which kept her from having to go right back to work as a freelance project manager and sell the house they had only bought the previous year, at a massive loss. But she grew tired of explain to . companies that her husband had died and she needed access to the account . because she did not know any of his passwords. This experience inspired her to create her website which already has 500,000 page views and the spreadsheet lists detailing what to write down have been downloaded 85,000 times. Idea: Get Your S*** Together was the brainchild of Chanel Reynolds, 42, who felt after her husband was killed in an accident, the grieving process was made more traumatic by financial worries . The site offers some basic financial . advice, gives away free templates for a master checklist and provides . starter forms to draft a will, living will and power of attorney. There’s also a guide to starting a . list of all of the accounts in your life that someone might need to . access and shut down in your absence. She believes the website is unique because it puts both life planning and death planning in the same place. As well as practical advice Ms Reynold's also offers personal advice - she says parents need to think about who would look after their children. If she says a user finds themselves at a loss to know who should care for their children or to who they would like to make the decision to withdraw care then perhaps they may need to reconsider their friends.","Chanel Reynold has set up a website helping people to get their affairs in order in case they unexpectedly die .

"In contrast to the constant barrage of women's fashion magazines declaring what is attractive, photographer Mihaela Noroc set off on a journey around the world. The Romanian traveled to 37 different countries, where she often met women simply walking the street and took their portraits, highlighting what is considered desirable in different cultures. From the freezing, chaffing Tibetan Plateau near the Himalayas to the sultry tropics of South America, Noroc, 29, entitled her startling and revealing project, 'The Atlas of Beauty.' At times spending only 30 seconds with each subject and traveling only with her camera and a backpack, Noroc tried to take pictures of young women all in their twenties. She explained in a statement to Daily Mail Online 'I'm a [29-year-old] female photographer from Romania that quit her boring job and started a new life. Two years ago I took my backpack, my camera and begun to travel around the globe, with savings made in years of working.

A woman is seen on the left in Colombia, and the woman on the right is at the Tibetan Plateau . Noroc said she visited a variety of locations, including favelas in Brazil and 'rough neighborhoods of Colombia,' as well as an Iranian mosque and the Amazon rainforest. She said in her statement 'Now I can say that beauty is everywhere, and it’s not a matter of cosmetics, money, race or social status, but more about being yourself. 'Global directions make us look and behave the same, but we are all beautiful because we are different. In the end, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and the beholder is always somebody else.' Noroc added 'When I photograph a woman I talk a lot, I try to to make her feel special, proud and unique. I can get along in 5 languages and this helps me a lot, but in some countries, talking becomes body language.

'Through [""The Atlas of Beauty,""] I wish to compare the faces of the world and to show that all the women from my photos have something beautiful,' she said in the statement. 'But the comparison has to be made using similar conditions and so I choose only one age group, the one that I'm part of. I think beauty is not about age. [It's] more about being natural and sincere.' Noroc also revealed that 'My goal is to continue and take photos of women from each country of the globe, making ""The Atlas Of Beauty"" a mirror of our diverse societies and an inspiration for people that try to remain authentic. 'Maybe in 50 years all women from all around the world will dress and act the same. I hope my project will remain a witness of my era’s cultures and traditions.'

'I now produce shows . for the London branch, the first outside . of North America,' says Sophia. And ever since coming to the UK, Naked Girls Reading's popularity has soared. 'We have different theme for each show. I love producing and performing in it as . it involves two things I appreciate - good literature and beautiful . women. 'The show has grown more and more popular, so much so as we've had . to change venues to accommodate our audience.' Sophia, who also works as a burlesque artist and pin-up model, explains the readers' beauty look. 'We often style our hair and makeup in . accordance with the theme. 'For example, for the Naked Girls Reading Scary Stories show [performer] Crimson Skye and I wore dramatic, terrifying . makeup. 'For the Naked Girls Reading Banned Books and Valentine's Day . shows we wore our makeup in our usual style which is inspired by . mid-century fashions, the 1930s, 40s and 50s - red lips, dark eyes and . false eyelashes.' 'Worldwide, performers style themselves . appropriately to the theme of a show. 'Personally, I wear vintage . clothing and makeup day-to-day, so I bring an element of this to the . Naked Girls Reading London shows. 'For my . burlesque acts, I love taking inspiration from glamourous, Golden Age . Hollywood stars Rita Hayworth, Marlene Dietrich and Hedy Lamarr and . classic burlesque artists Tempest Storm, Lili St. Cyr and Blaze Starr.' (L-R) Abigail Collins, Sophia St. Villier and Mysti Vine have a giggle during a reading . Sophia loves that they read paper books. Naked Girls Reading is an electronic reader-free zone . 'The audience is made up of couples, groups of friends and a few people who come by themselves,' she says. 'We have audience members that come to each show - they must love the literature, as they've already seen us naked! With burlesque shows, the audience is roughly 70 per cent women, 30 per cent men. For Naked Girls Reading, it's around 50 per cent women and 50 per cent men. 'The most common comment I hear from audience members is that after the first 10 minutes they forget we are naked and get lost in the story. For the Naked Girls Reading Scary Stories show Crimson Skye and Sophia wore Halloween-style makeup . 'People love being read to and many haven't experienced that since childhood. 'It's a fun show and discussions often occur with the audience between readings. During our Banned Books show, we asked the audience to guess why each book had been banned - our audience could not believe that James and the Giant Peach was banned due to sexual inferences and references to drugs! 'One of the funniest times was when I was reading a  book of scary urban legends at our Scary Stories show - the legends were so ridiculous, I couldn't stop laughing and the audience had the giggles too. Our fans often write in requesting themes which we take on board. And no, the audience are not naked, only the performers are.' The next show - Naked Girls Reading Rock and Roll - is on 25 February 2014 at ProudCamden, NW1 8AH - expect Bowie and Kiss makeup, rock biographers and maybe evennaked air guitar.","Naked Girls Reading show involves nude women reciting novels .

"Police have released stomach-turning video taken from inside the disgusting home of accused North Carolina 'Satanist killer' Pazuza Algarad. Inside the Clemmons house, behind which police uncovered two long-dead bodies from a shallow grave last month, is a virtual sea of trash, animal feces and other putrescence within walls utterly covered in pentagrams and depictions of the Devil. The squalid scene lay behind a door covered in skulls and arcane symbols. Otherwise, the ranch-style brick home suggests none of the horrors police say took place inside and which date back as far as 2009. Scroll down for video . Squalor: Police have released stomach-turning video taken from inside the disgusting home of accused North Carolina 'Satanist killer' Pazuza Algarad . 'Satanist killers': Police charged Pazuza Algarad, 35 (right) with murder, along with 24-year-old Amber Burch (left), after they dug two bodies out of their back yard in early October . Early this past October, police dug two bodies out from the yard behind the home 35-year-old Algarad shared with his Satanist mother Cynthia Lawson and his self-proclaimed wife Amber Burch, 24. The first victim has been identified as 37-year-old Joshua Fredrick Wetzler while the second victim has been named as Tommy Dean Welch, 36. Police say they wound up dead and buried in the yard in 2009. Algarad was arrested and charged with murder October 5 after the two bodies were discovered at the house in Clemmons where neighbors say he has performed animal sacrifices and satanic rituals. A friend claims that he had 'told everyone' about the bodies, but nobody believed him, and he described how he killed them, ate part of them and then burned the rest in a fire pit. Burch was also charged with murder, while 28-year-old Krystal Nicole Matlock has been charged as an accessory with police alleging that she helped bury the bodies. Police have said they also found animal bones in the property and that more arrests as part of the investigation are possible. After the trio were detained, Forsyth District Judge Gordon Miller assigned capital defenders to represent them. Miller told them that if convicted, they could receive life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. They are set to appear in court on October 23. Pentagrams: Pentagrams adorn most every wall of the Clemmons, North Carolina home the couple shared with Algarad's mom, fellow Satanist Cynthia Lawson .

Purtid: A bathroom was also completely trashed and featured a road safety cone . Accessory? Krystal Nicole Matlock has been charged as an accessory with police alleging that she helped bury the bodies . On the front door of the house where the skeletal remains were found was a sign warning law-enforcement not to enter. It reads: 'No gang members allowed: anyone that dresses the same, has the same badge and call themselves the authority of the land they did not create. Below and to the right is a picture of a skull and cross bones. Under that picture are the words, 'Evil will triumph'. According to the Winston-Salem Journal, Algarad was born in San Francisco, California, as John Lawson, but dropped out of high school, became a drug dealer. His mother Cynthia Lawson, who is also a Satanist, changed his name to Pazuzu - after the devil that possessed the girl in the film The Exorcis - and claimed it was of Iraqi descent. His tongue was split down the middle like a snake and he allegedly filed down his teeth to sharpen them. In 2010, Algarad was convicted on a charge of accessory after the fact in the shooting death of 30-year-old Joseph Chandler. Chandler's body was found near a river by police after his mother reported him missing that morning. According to state records, Algarad was on probation at the time the bodies were found. Bianca Heath claimed she lived with Algarad for a month in 2005, and that he had spoken of the bones in his back yard. She told The Huffington Post: 'Paz told everyone. But I never believed him. I'm sure no one else believed him either. He laughed about the skeletal remains when telling the story on why he did what he did.' Heath said Algarad told her he picked up two prostitutes at two separate locations before he killed and ate them, burning the remains in a fire pit before burying the rest. In 2011, Burch was accused of slapping Algarad's mother in the face and attempting to choke her. She is described as Algarad's wife on Facebook, but authorities have said there is no legal document to suggest they are together.

"Customers were furious yesterday after their bank left them stranded without cash for the second time in less than a year. They bombarded Royal Bank of Scotland message boards and social networks after an IT glitch meant they could not use cash machines. Telephone and online banking services were also disrupted by the problem, which began around 9pm on Wednesday. Furious customers were left stranded without access to their money as Natwest computer systems went into meltdown. RBS boss Stephen Hester was forced to say sorry only less than a year ago after a similar IT failure . State-backed RBS, which includes NatWest and Ulster Bank, said a hardware fault was to blame and claimed the problem was rectified within two hours. It apologised for an ‘unacceptable failure’ and promised to compensate customers for any losses they suffered. But RBS insisted there was no link to last summer’s chaos, when a botched software upgrade left 16million RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers unable to make or receive payments – in some cases for several weeks. RBS, which received a £45.5billion bail-out from taxpayers in 2008, has already set aside £175million to compensate customers for June’s chaos. It could not say how many were affected by Wednesday night’s problems but a message board on NatWest’s website was swamped with complaints, some of which referred to the company’s ‘helpful banking’ slogan. One customer wrote: ‘I can’t get to work as card declined on train, so lost a day’s wage and [you] expect me to pay to call for info!’ Another said: ‘Really upset that NatWest comms have failed again. We understand that things sometimes go wrong – but ‘helpful banking’ is all about helping people and communication with them. After last year’s fiasco I stuck with you, but now I’m not going to.’ A Twitter user from Aylesbury said: ‘All that money made, all that money paid out in bonuses, all those software migration issues ignored.’ Helpful banking? This was the error screen on the NatWest online banking website last night as millions were unable to use services for several hours . @SteveJayUK : #natwest A very disappointed customer, once again your system fails and all we get is a sorry. Time to get a grip.‏ . @Konichikagawa: @NatWest_Help so will you be paying for our telephone bill for 0845? no… I’m switching this weekend. s*** customer service. s*** banking‏ . @ClareMiller1: Tried to book our holiday last night, unfortunately #natwest were having problems again. Hope the price hasn't gone up today/tomorrow :( . @isofarro: Some good news, my bank NatWest allowed me to buy a train ticket with my NatWest card this morning. that was terribly nice of them . The latest shambles came as RBS boss Stephen Hester scooped a shares bonus worth nearly £700,000. He received almost 23,000 shares yesterday from a bonus awarded in 2010. Mr Hester forfeited his bonus for 2012, worth up to £2.4million, following last summer’s chaos. Marc Gander of the Consumer Action Group, said: ‘It would be far more appropriate for RBS to spend this money on improving its disastrous IT systems rather than shovelling more into Hester’s personal trough’. RBS said it spends between £1billion and £2billion a year on its IT systems, which have privately been described as ‘chronic’ by regulators and are thought to be the reason why rival bank Santander pulled out of a £1.65billion deal to buy 315 of its branches last year. An RBS spokesman said: ‘We apologise for the disruption our customers experienced last night. ‘All systems are up and running as normal, though any customers with any individual problems should get in touch with us. ‘Any customer who was left out of pocket due to this outage should get in touch so we can put things right for them.’","Customers bombard message boards and social networks following fault .

"A veteran who collapsed in an Albuquerque Veteran Affairs hospital cafeteria, 500 yards from the emergency room, died after waiting 30 minutes for an ambulance, officials confirmed on Thursday. Officials at the hospital said it took a half an hour for the ambulance to be dispatched and take the man from one building to the other, which is about a five minute walk. VA spokeswoman Sonja Brown said Kirtland Air Force Medical Group personnel performed CPR until the ambulance arrived. A veteran who needed an ambulance after collapsing in the cafeteria of the Albuquerque Veterans Affairs Hospital died after waiting 30 minutes for an ambulance . She says staff followed policy in calling 911 when the man collapsed on Monday. 'Our policy is under expedited review,' Brown said. The man's name hasn't been released. The death comes at the Department of Veterans Affairs remains under scrutiny for widespread reports of long delays for treatment and medical appointments and of veterans dying while on waiting lists. A review last week cited 'significant and chronic system failures' in the nation's health system for veterans. The review also portrayed the struggling agency as one battling a corrosive culture of distrust, lacking in resources and ill-prepared to deal with an influx of new and older veterans with a range of medical and mental health care needs. The scathing report by deputy White House chief of staff Rob Nabors said the Veterans Health Administration, the VA sub agency that provides health care to about 8.8 million veterans a year, has systematically ignored warnings about its deficiencies and must be fundamentally restructured. Acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Sloan Gibson speaks during a news conference at the VA Medical Center in Washington on Wednesday to release the results from its Nationwide Access Audit . Not only are Veterans forced to wait for ambulances, tens of thousands more veterans than previously reported are forced to wait at least a month for medical appointments at Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics, according to an updated audit of 731 VA medical facilities released in June. The updated report includes new figures showing that the wait times actually experienced at most VA facilities were shorter than those on waiting lists for pending appointments. For instance, new patients at the Atlanta VA hospital waited about an average of 44 days for an appointment in April, the new report said. But the average wait for pending appointments at Atlanta was 66 days. Similar disparities in average wait times were found around the country. Pending appointments, for example, don't include patients who walk into a clinic and get immediate or quick treatment, VA officials said. They also don't reflect rescheduled appointments or those that are moved up because of openings due to cancellations. VA officials said the two sets of data complement one another, but both are evidence that many veterans face long waits for care. More than 56,000 veterans were waiting more than 90 days for an initial appointment, the new report said. 'In many communities across the country, veterans wait too long for the high quality care they've earned and deserve,' acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said back in June. The department has reached out to 70,000 veterans to get them off waiting lists and into clinics, Gibson said, 'but there is still much more work to be done.' The report released Thursday showed that about 10 percent of veterans seeking medical care at VA hospitals and clinics have to wait at least 30 days for an appointment. That's more than double the 4 percent of veterans the government said last week were forced to endure long waits. Gibson called the increase unfortunate, but said it was probably an indication that more reliable data was being reported by VA schedulers, rather than a big increase in veteran wait times. Administrators at local VA medical centers questioned the results of an audit released June 9, which looked only at pending appointments. The report did not match internal data on completed appointments showing waits actually were far shorter, the local officials said. The reliability of both sets of data is in question. The VA is investigating widespread manipulation of appointment data by schedulers following an uproar over since-confirmed allegations that dozens of veterans died while awaiting appointments at the Phoenix VA medical center. This 2007 file photo shows Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital, a Veteran's facility in Washington . Some 13 percent of schedulers surveyed by the auditors reported being told by supervisors to falsify appointment records to make patient waits appear shorter. The VA's inspector general has cited a since-abandoned performance bonus system as a reason for the falsifications, which schedulers used to mask frequent, long delays in treatment for veterans. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned three weeks ago amid an election-year firestorm over the treatment delays and waiting list problems at VA facilities nationwide.Shinseki took the blame for what he decried as a 'lack of integrity' through the VA network, which serves nearly 9 million veterans. The House and Senate have approved separate bills to allow more veterans who can't get timely VA appointments to see local doctors listed instead. The proposals also would make it easier to fire senior VA regional officials and hospital administrators. The June 9 audit found that more than 57,000 veterans were waiting at least 90 days for their first VA medical appointments, and an additional 64,000 appeared to have fallen through the cracks, never getting appointments after enrolling for VA care within the past 10 years. The new report said the number of veterans waiting more than 90 days dropped to about 56,300. About 46,400 veterans still have never gotten an appointment despite seeking one over the past decade, the report said. Gibson, who replaced Shinseki May 30, said he still is not 100 percent confident that all wait times listed on VA computers — and its audits — are accurate. 'I have vastly greater confidence in the quality' of wait-time data being reported by VA employees, he said during a speech this week in Washington. 'But I can't look at the entire database and say it's correct either.'","Officials at Albuquerque Veterans Affairs Hospital said it took a .

"The number of Americans living in poor neighborhoods has skyrocketed in the last decade - and nowhere is the trend more prominent than in the South, where more than 30percent of the population is concentrated in an area with high poverty. A grim new report from the U.S. Census Bureau shows a solid band of high poverty neighborhoods - running from Arizona east to North Carolina. Only Florida and Virginia are spared from the trend. The data show that poverty in the United States isn't just growing, it's becoming more concentrated - which can exacerbate social problems and lower the chances of social mobility. The Census report points out that the number of people living under the federal poverty line - less than $24,000 a year for a family of four - has increased between 2000 and 2010. The number of Americans living in poverty climbed 45percent to 45million.

North Carolina and Tennessee had the biggest increase in the number of residents living in poor neighborhoods. Louisiana, West Virginia, Hawaii and Alaska were the only states where the figure decreased . However, the number of Americans living in 'poverty areas' - neighborhoods where more than 20percent of residents are impoverished - has increased even more dramatically. A quarter of the U.S. population, 77million Americans, lived in poverty areas in 2010 - a shocking 56percent jump from the 2000 census. In the South, the trend is eve n more dramatic. Nearly 31percent of Southerners live in poor neighborhoods - an increase of 62percent from 2000. The Census report says that people who live in high poverty neighborhoods face an array of problems - even for those are earning decent wages. 'Problems associated with living in poverty areas, such as, higher crime rates, poor housing conditions, and fewer job opportunities are exacerbated when poor families live clustered in high-poverty neighborhoods,' the authors write. The percentage of residents living in poverty areas increased in every state except Louisiana, Hawaii and Alaska. The rapidly-gentrifying District of Columbia saw a decline of 6.7 percentage points. North Carolina, Tennessee and Oregon as the biggest jump in percentage of residents in poor neighborhoods. The figure grew 18 percentage points, 16 percentage points and 16 percentage points, respectively.

The charge comes after two men were earlier released on bail following their arrest for making alleged offensive comments on Twitter about the murder. Complaints were made to Avon and Somerset Police about remarks that appeared on the social networking website, which were allegedly of a racist or anti-religious nature. A great character: Father of one and soldier Rigby, of Greater Manchester, pictured relaxing on Army leave . Attack: Drummer Rigby was killed on the street in Woolwich, south London when Michael Adebolajo launched his attack . Shocking: The Twitter comments come after the attack in London. Police say they do even more harm to the community . A 23-year-old and a 22-year-old, both from Bristol, were held under the Public Order Act on suspicion of inciting racial or religious hatred. Detective Inspector Ed Yaxley, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'On Wednesday evening, we were contacted by people concerned about comments made on social media accounts. 'We began inquiries into the comments and at around 3.20am two men, aged 23 and 22, were detained at two addresses in Bristol. 'The men were arrested under the Public Order Act on suspicion of inciting racial or religious hatred. Our inquiries into these comments continue. 'These comments were directed against a section of our community. Comments such as these are completely unacceptable and only cause more harm to our community in Bristol. 'People should stop and think about what they say on social media before making statements as the consequences could be serious.' Police confirmed the two men were later released on bail pending further inquiries.

"A tiny strip of land which is only the size of two  snooker tables has been sold for just over £120,000, making it one of the country's most expensive gardens. The minature outdoor space measures just 440 square feet, or one-hundredth of an acre, and was sold for an incredible rate of £272.73 per square foot. The land in desirable Fulham, West London had been due to go under the hammer with auctioneers Strettons, who had set a guide price on it of £85,000. Pricey: the tiny plot, behind the yellow and pink fence has sold for an incredible £120,000 - despite being the size of just two snooker tables . However, after threatening to spark an intense bidding war between neighbours it was snapped up by one nearby resident just before the auction. More than 100 buyers had been interested in the sought-after street-corner plot, not far from Fulham Broadway station, according to the magazine Estates Gazette. A large tree currently stands on the land, which is surrounded by fencing. Desirable: The tiny plot of land near Fulham Broadway station fetched £273 per square foot - despite not having planning permission to build on it . Sold: The land had been set to go under the hammer but was snapped up before the auction after attracting the interest of more than 100 would-be buyers . The sales catalogue had described the land as being suitable for a number of uses, including a car park, subject to planning permission. However, past owners have tried - and failed - to obtain consent to build on it. The garden’s huge selling price is a sign of the flourishing property market in London and the South East. London house prices have risen by an average of £50,000 in the past month alone. In June 2010, a 20ft by 12ft plot of land in St. Ives, Cornwall was sold as a car parking space for £60,000. Canny councillors in West Lothian, Scotland, sold a 29.5sq ft plot of unused land to a neighbouring landlord for £1 million in October 2004. He had intended to sell his adjoining site to developers, but the council owned the strip of land linking the two plots. Neighbours in Whitchurch, Bristol, made a combined £2.5 million when they sold sections of their back gardens to developers building a new housing estate in April 2009. Buyers paid £3.5 million for a run-down home destined for the wrecking ball in the south coast millionaire's resort of Sandbanks, Poole, Dorset, earlier this year. In July 2009 a 14,990 sq ft empty plot of land on Sandbanks was put up for sale for £13.5 million – the equivalent of nearly £900 per square foot.","Miniature outdoor space measures just one-hundredth of an acre .

"A singer was lucky to survive after suffering a huge electric shock in the middle of his performance in front of thousands of fans. Nolberto was mid-way through his band Alkala's song ‘Yo por tu amor’ (Me for your love) at a carnival in Ranchillos, Argentina, when he placed his hand on a metal pole. Dramatic mobile phone footage shows him convulsing as the volts start to surge through his body. Scroll down for video . Electrifying performance: Nolberto sings on stage with his band during an Argentinian carnival - so far so good . Bad choice: During the performance, Nolberto walks across the stage to grab hold of part of the set, to emphasize his lyrics . Sizzling show: As Nolberto grabs the metal pole, electricity shoots through his body and the shirt on his back even emits smoke as he is shocked . Smoke then starts to rise from his arms, and he collapses off the stage. With the audience screaming in terror, security men rushed to his unconscious side. After several minutes, Nolberto regained consciousness and, like a true professional, returned to the stage to continue the show. ‘Nothing like this has ever happened to me before,’ Nolberto, from the Dominican Republic, later told Diario La Provincia. As the electric shock makes his body shake, Nolberto throws himself off the stage to avoid further injury . Recovering: The singer is helped up from the floor and aided out of the crowd by a member of security . Lucky shot: The performer says he knew he had to throw himself off the stage in order to avoid being electrocuted . ‘What happened was that the stage was damp, and when I touched the metal I was shocked. So to stop myself from being electrocuted I had to throw myself off the stage,’ he added. It might make the Argentinian singer feel a little bit better, knowing that he probably won't make the same mistake again. Scientists at Oxford University have discovered a part of the brain that helps stop humans from making bad decisions. While other parts of the brain keep tabs on how well decisions are working, this new region thinks over what we might have done instead.","Singer shocked mid-way through his performance in Ranchillos, Argentina .

"It was once a shrine to man's best friend. But now, few would recognize this moss-covered, bedraggled, crumbling woodland as a pet cemetery. The abandoned graveyard in New Orleans, Louisiana, was all but destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Thirty years prior, its owner was killed by a gravestone cutter and found half-naked, wrapped in chains, with a garbage bag tied to her neck by an electrical wire. Now, after stumbling across it by chance, photo-journalist Seph Lawless has captured the site in all it's eerie splendor. Scroll down for video .

But now, few would recognize this moss-covered, crumbling woodland as a pet cemetery . The cemetery is more than 100 years old, with headstones dedicated to animals from as far away as Italy. One is simply engraved with the name: 'Satan'. And the house that used to run it has collapsed. 'It was truly the creepiest experience I've ever had,' photographer Seph Lawless told DailyMail.com.

Love: Lawless said he was deeply moved by the scene as he walked among all the touching messages of love from owners to their pets . Upended: While some are rooted flat in the ground, other gravestones have been flipped by the hurricane and dropped at an angle . 'There are vines covering everything, it is all collapsed... it was very creepy.' Seemingly deserted, there was one sign that pet owners may still visit the site: there was dog food strewn across one headstone. 'That was very moving,' Lawless said. 'It was a strange place but truly one of the most touching and moving experiences I've ever had.' Lawless, who has compiled the images into a book went home to research the history of the cemetery but found very little online.

"This is the moment a German tennis player lobs her racquet at a linesman after flying into a rage over a bad call.

"Thousands of British passengers were hit by disruption and cancelled flights yesterday as a strike in France caused air gridlock across Europe. Hundreds of services to and from the UK were axed and hundreds more delayed by up to six hours at the start of a six-day walkout by militant air traffic controllers. Officials warned worse was to come for travellers trying to get away at the start of the summer holiday  season because the strike is likely to remain solid until Sunday. Chaos: Thousands of passengers were stranded by French strikes yesterday including these at Stansted Airport . Grounded: Long queues formed at Stansted Airport in Essex as Ryanair cancelled around 200 flights . Airlines reported ‘severe disruption’ as they had to ground up to  a quarter of flights to ease  hold-ups. They warned that  conditions will get ‘materially worsen’ today as the backlog builds up. Yesterday Ryanair cancelled 200 flights and will axe another 250 today while easyJet grounded more than 100 services. British Airways wiped out around 24 and has already axed another 28 flights tomorrow. Passengers with Monarch and Flybe were also badly affected. Airlines were unable to access congested airspace over France so did their best to fly around it. A spokesman for British  Airways said: ‘It’s like closing a lane on the motorway. ‘The other traffic has to squeeze into the remaining lanes, so you get a jam. The cancellations are one thing. It’s the knock-on effect of the congestion in the sky which causes added problems.’ Waiting for news: These teenagers took up residence on the floor of Stansted Airport during the strikes . Alongside the hundreds of flights cancelled, hundreds more were delayed for up to six hours . Ryanair admitted that yesterday’s disruption had been ‘more severe than predicted’. Marketing head Kenny Jacobs condemned the stoppage by the militants ‘who have deliberately initiated industrial actions at the busiest time of the year to cause maximum chaos’. He added: ‘Ordinary people who work hard all year to take a well-earned holiday have had their travel plans disrupted through no fault of theirs, or of Ryanair’s, because of the selfish actions of so few.’ The company said it was  factoring in . delays of up to six hours for flights to and from France as well as . those flying over France. The strike has hit many young people who have just finished GCSE, A-level and university exams . Air safety body Eurocontrol predicted that the industrial action will cause almost 14,000 hours of delays. Last night it said French airspace was operating at minimum capacity. European Union plans backed by France’s Socialist government for a ‘single European sky’ have angered the air traffic  controllers who fear job cuts. Although the strike is before the main summer getaway, it will hit business travellers and families with pupils who have just finished their GCSEs or A-levels hoping for an early break. Passengers trying to get back to Britain also risk being stranded abroad if their flight is grounded. The knock-on impact of delays and cancellations became acute as it left planes and crews in the wrong place. This hits budget airlines particularly hard as they tend to be short-haul and rely on a fast turnaround. Holidaymaker Jane Goulding, 47, was held up at Stansted. ‘I have never seen the airport this busy,’ she said. ‘I’m worried I’m going to be queuing for hours.’ Queues and crowds built up as airlines axed 30 flights to and from the Essex hub and extra police and security guards were drafted in. Luton Airport reported delays to 60 per cent of departing flights while Heathrow said it had 44 cancellations. Gatwick said most services were held up because of knock-on effects. ‘Planes are ready but they are having to queue while they wait for take-off and landing slots,’ said a spokesman. ‘The departure lounge is busier than  normal as people have to wait.’ Retired company director Anthony Pargeter said he had missed a memorial service in London after his flights from Ibiza, where he has a holiday home, to Barcelona and then onto Gatwick were both axed. ‘Not only have I lost £400 but I felt it was my duty to go,’ he said. ‘It is extremely annoying.’ Airlines said they are emailing or texting passengers to rebook or offer a refund. Temporary home: Another delayed passenger at Stansted. Holidaymaker Jane Goulding, 47, said: 'I have never seen the airport this busy... I'm worried I'm going to be queuing for hours' Clog: Airline operators said the dilemma was similar to the backlog caused by closing lanes on a motorway .","Hundreds of services to and from Britain were cancelled yesterday .

Authorities are also preparing for non-terror-related disruption from protesters, as it has emerged Queensland police will formally ban two individuals from attending the G20 summit and track destructive protest groups during final preparations for the event. Much of the Brisbane CBD and South Bank area will become a restricted or declared zone from November 14, when a sophisticated security operation will be initiated to protect world leaders. It will involve 4500 Queensland police officers, 1500 interstate and New Zealand officers, Australian Federal Police and defence. More than 900 soldiers will be based in Brisbane for the event, with a further 1000 on call, however Maj Gen Smith said it would be up to the QPS or federal authorities to ask for assistance. 'It's really a background support that we're providing, only those niche search capabilities and counter-terrorism and air support that may be provided,' he said. Specialist soldiers and military dogs will be used to sweep conference venues, hotels and waterways . ADF commander for the G20 commitment, Major General Stuart Smith, said defence has worked closely with state and federal agencies for 18 months to prepare for the summit . 'So I surmise you won't see a great presence by the military.' Authorities have also announce plans to open a 24-hour court to deal with the expected mass arrests. The court, which will open on November 10, mirrors the approach of Toronto police during the 2010 summit, when 1100 people were arrested and dealt with in a specialised court. Specialist soldiers and military dogs would be used to sweep conference venues, hotels and waterways prior to the summit, he said.

Soldiers descended from military helicopters as part of the anti-terrorism training ahead of next month's G20 . More than 900 soldiers will be based in Brisbane for the event, with a further 1000 on call . Meanwhile, the number of known protest groups planning to attend the G20 has risen to 24. Police are eager to communicate with protest groups but would not tolerate destructive behaviour, Assistant Commissioner Katarina Carroll said. 'We know from these events around the world, they do attract an element of people who will come to create disorder,' Ms Carroll told reporters in Brisbane. 'We're quite aware of who those groups are and certainly we'll be keeping an eye on them as we lead into G20.' Much of the Brisbane CBD and South Bank area will become a restricted or declared zone from November 14 . The defence personnel wore full assault gear during the training exercises . The two banned individuals would be served with official documents under special G20 legislation 'in the next week or two', but Ms Carroll would not comment on their identity. As the summit draws nearer, speculation has mounted that international protest groups may be considering a presence in Brisbane. The 'Black Bloc' technique used by some violent, anonymous protesters at past G20 events was one of numerous tactics used by groups, Ms Carroll said. Police have information on Black Bloc protesters, but Ms Carroll refused to elaborate. Locally, a number of online anarchist groups have emerged and threatened to hold violent protests before the summit.

One group, calling itself Plan B, says it opposes the G20 group of nations, who will meet on November 15-16 at Brisbane's Convention and Exhibition Centre. Anonymous anarchists have posted on their website: 'We are encouraging individuals and groups to take action which they see as effective and necessary given their circumstances. We do not see property destruction as an inherently violent act.' In a separate post, they wrote: 'While the p**s are helplessly patrolling the streets of Brisbane's CBD in their ridiculous armour with their intimidating vehicles, decentralised waves of creation and destruction will ebb and flow right across the country.' Other groups such as the Autonomous Action Radio, which broadcasts a weekly community radio show, has created posters which are on display across Brisbane depicting balaclava-clad protesters throwing objects and toppling over bins.

' Another recently formed group is the Brisbane Street Medics, who say they are 'Street Medics serving the activist community in Brisbane, Australia,' on their official Facebook page. In addition to local factions, there are concerns that notorious international groups such as Black Bloc, thought to be responsible for the riot in the 2010 G20 summit in Toronto, are attempting to mobilise in Brisbane. Associate Professor Janet Ransley, who heads Griffith University's School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, told Brisbane Times  'I think it would be naive to think that Black Bloc and some of those groups are not mobilising. Members of the Plan B group have posted online: 'While the pigs are helplessly patrolling the streets of Brisbane's CBD in their ridiculous armour with their intimidating vehicles, decentralised waves of creation and destruction will ebb and flow right across the country' The Brisbane Convention Centre, where the Group of 20 forum is planned for the 15-16 of November . 'I know there has been some chatter on social media about them trying to get a presence in Brisbane.' Ms Ransley said.

"Spies around the world could soon be able to listen in on secret conversations without any fear of being found out thanks to the first ever one-way sound machine. Sound waves traditionally travel forward before bouncing back, and with sound this means you can speak, hear yourself speak, and hear any responses. Called an acoustic circulator, the first-of-its-kind system uses fans to change the flow of air as the sound waves travel through it, and this prevents the waves from bouncing back. Scroll down for video . The centre of the acoustic circulator, pictured, is fitted with three specially positioned fans that change the flow of air through the separate chambers. The arrows show how sound waves flow from one port, to the next, in sequence, and never bounce back. The circulator is the first-ever one-way sound machine . The circulator was created by a team of researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin led by Professor Andrea Alu. Alu said his experiments successfully prove that the 'fundamental symmetry with which acoustic waves travel through air between two points in space - for example, if you can hear, you can also be heard - can be broken by a compact and simple device'. The inspiration for the device came from current three-port electronic circulators that are typically used in communication devices and radars. For example, Microwaves and radio signals are able to move from one port to the next in sequence, meaning they're never sent back to the recipient. In the middle of the team’s acoustic circulator is a 'resonant ring cavity' fitted with three small computer fans (pictured right). These fans circulate and keep the airflow travelling at a specific velocity. The ring is connected to three ports, each with a microphone fitted to the end that can record sound. During Professor Alu’s experiment, researchers sent sound from one port to another. When . the fans were turned off, the sound signal from Port 1 split in half . and travelled through the two other ports, Port 2 and Port 3, as . expected - known as ‘transmission symmetry’. However, . when the researchers turned the fans on and delivered a moderate . airflow into the ring, with specific velocity tailored to the ring . design, transmission symmetry was broken and the signal from Port 1 . would flow into Port 2, leaving Port 3 isolated. Similarly, when a signal was sent from Port 2, it would flow into Port 3, leaving Port 1 isolated, and so on. The sound waves continued to move through the ports in sequence, and never travelled in the opposite direction or bounced back. In these electronic circulators, when one of the ports isn’t being used, the system acts as an isolator, letting signals to flow from one port to the other, but not back. The UT Austin team realised the same principles could apply from sound waves traveling in air, which led to the team's building of a first-of-its-kind three-port acoustic circulator. 'Using the proposed concept, we were able to create one-way communication for sound traveling through air,' said Professor Alu. 'Imagine being able to listen without having to worry about being heard in return. ‘It . is just the right spin of fluid (air) coupled with the strong resonance . of our ring cavity, which makes our design powerful.' To test the circulator, researchers sent sound from one port, pictured, to another. When the fans were turned off, the signal from Port 1 split and travelled through the two other ports - known as transmission symmetry. However, when the researchers turned the fans on transmission symmetry was broken . 'These two combined mechanisms create strong nonreciprocity in a compact device. Sound waves are routed in one direction only - always contrary to the direction of the airflow.' The findings, Sound Isolation and Giant Linear Nonreciprocity in a Compact Acoustic Circulator, are published the journal Science. This research may eventually create an ‘acoustical version of one-way glass,’ said Preston Wilson, acoustics expert and associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. ‘It also opens up avenues for very efficient sound isolation and interesting new concepts for active control of sound isolators.' The researchers are now working on using these concepts to create nonreciprocal circulators and isolators for radio waves and light, as well as a design for the sound circulator that does not use moving parts.","The one-way sound machine is called an acoustic circulator .

Today, it appeared to be a hit with customers - reaching number 4 on the iTunes download store within hours of release. Scroll down for video . Facebook Paper, pictured, is the first product to launch from the California firm's Creative Labs project. It's a news curation app that pulls in stories, photos and videos from a user's Facebook news feed. It additionally comes with Facebook's own notification bar and action buttons. The app is set to launch on 3 February . Facebook has a history of developing separate apps for new features, such as the Facebook Messenger and Camera apps. Like Paper, these apps linked with the original Facebook app but had their own set of features. Facebook Messenger lets people chat while using other apps, for example. Paper, on the other hand, includes many of Facebook's existing features. However, FiftyThree, makers of the iPad drawing app Paper, said it had contacted Facebook about changing the name of its news reading app Paper. While Facebook apologized for not checking with FiftyThree, it did not change the name. Facebook 'should stop using our brand name,' FiftyThree said. Facebook's Paper is a news curation and reader app that pulls in stories, photos, videos and links from the user's Facebook feed - alongside Facebook's own notification bar and action buttons. All stories are displayed on a customisable picture-led grid, and the app has been designed to make it easier to share content with other people. Users can also browse content and read stories from partner publications, as well as customise which categories they see. Paper is set to launch in the U.S. on 3 February. The app looks similar to news reader rivals Flipboard and Google Currents. Each section has a main screen with a cover photo at the top, and a row of content along the bottom. Users can scroll left and right from the main screen through these content cards to see new stories, photos, videos, and so on. Alternatively, with Paper, users can select a story to see it in fullscreen mode. The traditional Facebook notification . bar is shown in the top right-hand corner of the screen - including . friend requests, messages and other notifications. Each section on the Facebook paper app has a main screen with a cover photo at the top, and a row of content along the bottom, pictured left.  Users can scroll left and right from the main screen through these content cards to see new stories, photos, videos and so on. These sections are all customisable, pictured right . The app looks similar to news reader Flipboard, pictured, as well as Google Currents. Paper users can browse content and read stories from partner Facebook publications, as well as customise categories . Facebook has a history of developing separate apps for new features, such as Facebook Messenger, pictured here being used with Instagram . When viewing individual stories, Facebook actions buttons are shown in the bottom left-hand corner, including like, comment and share. Similarly, users can post straight to Facebook from the Paper app - making the original Facebook app, in theory, redundant. All sections are customisable and users can change the cover photo, as well as the name of sections and the layout. When viewing content from select publications, users can filter by category and choose their favourite news outlets. Yet unlike other news reader and RSS apps, Facebook Paper will not let people add their own links. Paper is the first app to be developed in Facebook's Creative Labs that was set up last year. Facebook has a history of developing separate apps for new features, such as the Facebook Messenger and Camera apps. Like Paper, these apps linked with the original Facebook app but had their own set of features. Facebook Messenger lets people chat while using other apps, for example.

"A farm dog has given new meaning to being man's best friend - by ploughing his owner's potato field on his hind legs. Lemon the Giant Schnauzer's talents were spotted by his owner, a former military dog trainer in Russia's Omsk region, when he was just ten months old. Since then 48-year-old Aleksandr Matytsin has taught his pet to deliver logs, pump water from a tap, carry buckets of water and collect harvested crops. Scroll down for video . Lending a paw: Lemon the Giant Schnauzer has learned to plough potato fields on his owner's Russian farm . Skill: One of Lemon's favourite hobbies is said to be filling and carrying buckets of water for his owner . At your service: Lemon carrying a pail of water for his owner Aleksandr Matytsin, who insists he is very willing . Mr Matytsin insisted Lemon was perfectly happy to lend a paw and hardly ever demanded payment. He has been using Lemon as an unusual farm hand for more than a year and the pet has now become a minor celebrity in his home village of Tara. It began, he said, when he was chopping firewood and his pet began delivering logs to his feet. He started training Lemon to carry buckets of water and then moved on to more unusual tricks. The idea of a canine farm hand is not completely alien, since Giant Schnauzers - which stand at around 2ft tall when fully-grown - were used hundreds of years ago as working dogs. The breed was developed in Germany in the 17th Century and the animals are known for their powerful bodies and thick coats, which protect them from the elements. I'll drive: Lemon at the controls of his owner's snowmobile. Thankfully the engine was switched off at the time . No help needed: Lemon carries a piece of wood (left) and even his own lead before going for a walk . I've got this sorted: The Giant Schnauzer dragging a bag of crops across the snow-covered forest floor . Despite Lemon receiving the occasional treat, Mr Matytsin said helping out was usually enough of a reward. 'We noticed how willing he was to help when he was only ten months old,' he said. 'He picked up a log and brought it to me when I was chopping fire wood, then it was a bucket when I went for water. 'His favourite occupation is carrying buckets of water. Of course it is a big help to us - after a few trips he manages to bring an extra 25 litres. 'I do treat him with something tasty from time to time but he mostly does it because he simply likes to be helpful. 'He likes to try and do almost everything I do. I think if he had hands he would do everything for me. 'Unfortunately, his abilities are a little bit limited but we love his eagerness nonetheless.' Companion: Lemon was taught by his owner, former Russian military dog trainer Aleksandr Matytsin, 48 . A dog's life: It's not all work and no play for the pet, who has plenty of time off to relax around his owner's farm . Walkies... the easy way: Lemon on the back of his owner's snowmobile in the remote Russian wilderness . Wildlife: Lemon chewing the fat with a local horse. His owner said: 'He likes to try and do almost everything I do. I think if he had hands he would do everything for me.

"Muslims, Jews and Christians will worship under one roof as an architect sets out to make religious history. The so-called House Of One will be a multipurpose synagogue, church and mosque set in the heart of Berlin. Incredibly, the move has been met with unerring support from rabbis, imams and priests. Carefully designed: Each chamber will cater to the faith's specific requirements, with a foot bath and two levels in the mosque, an organ in the church, and two levels in the synagogue . The £35m building, being paid for by donations, is set to be completed in 2018. Last week, three religious leaders met to give their blessing to the project - and the first brick was ceremonially presented. It was the culmination of five years of work, after archaeologists unearthed the city's first ever church - Petrikirche - which dates back to 1350. 'We decided we needed to use the space to develop a sign of peace and tolerance, rather than another old empty church,' House Of One spokesman Anna Poeschel told MailOnline. 'Petrikirche was the start of Berlin, which has now grown into a multicultural, multi-faith city. A lot has happened over the centuries, this is a sign of peace and tolerance.' Celebrations: German pastor Gregor Hohberg (left), Israeli rabbi Tovia Ben-Chorin (centre) and German-Turkish imam Kadir Sanci pictured last week holding the first three bricks of the £35m building's foundation . Groundbreaking: German architect Wilfried Kuehn holds a model of his design for the House Of One, a multi-faith prayer building to be set in the heart of Berlin that combines a synagogue, church and mosque . The building, designed by architect Wilfried Kuehn in a competition created for the project, will provide one of the only inner-city places of worship for Berlin's Muslims, with most mosques located on the outskirts. Despite some voices of criticism, Ms Poeschel said the overwhelming reaction from all faiths has been welcoming. 'We have not always had as many Muslims in Berlin as in London. And this is the place where the Second World War started, with the persecution of Jews. This is a perfect symbol of peace. 'You hear so much these days of religions coming together in violence and terrorism so this is a different message.' Each of the three areas in the House will be the same size, but of a different shape, Mr Kuehn points out. There will be a central meeting place, with doors leading off into spaces for each faith. In the mosque and synagogue there will be two levels to cater for the traditional gender divide. There will also be space to wash feet in the mosque. Symbolic: Mr Kuehn, the religious leaders, and German actor Wolfgang Bahro (left), who is backing the move, pose at the start of the project, due to finish in 2018 . The church will have just one floor, and will house an organ. With different days of worship, congestion will be manageable. Muslims attend mosque on Fridays, while Jews congregate on Saturdays and Christians pray on Sundays. While each have different architectural requirements, architect Wilfried Kuehn insists they are not as different as many think. For example, it has not always been customary for mosques to have a minaret - spire. And according to ancient Christian designs, churches do not need a tower.","Synagogue, church and mosque, the 'House Of One', to be built in Berlin .

"Buckingham Palace was a hive of activity today as dozens descended on the Royal household to receive honours, presented by the Princess Royal. Meanwhile the Queen greeted Marguerite Pindling, the Governor-General of the Bahamas. Announced as Goveror-General on 8 July 2014, Marguerite is the widow of the former Prime Minister of the Bahamas, Lynden Pindling. She was welcomed by the Queen in her drawing room and invested with the Insignia of a Dame Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George. Scroll down for video . The Torchwood star and musical theatre veteran John Barrowman was awarded an MBE by Princess Anne . Dame Marguerite was invested with the Insignia of a Dame Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George . The Queen and Marguerite chatted animatedly, with both having chosen tailored over-the-knee skirts  and low-heeled patent shoes for the meeting. But while Her Royal Highness opted for a gentle pink shade for her skirt and matching top, teaming her outfit with a black handbag and delicate multi-strand pearl necklace, Dame Marguerite chose a vibrant turquoise with matching sequinned bag. Elsewhere in the Palace, members of the sporting and entertainment elite were also being honoured. Adding a touch of showbiz to the event was Torchwood star and musical theatre veteran John Barrowman who was awarded with a MBE by the Princess Royal. The Scottish-born American actor paid homage to his heritage by wearing a red tartan kilt and traditional sporran. Also recognised at the investiture was Martin Hewitt, Assistant Commissioner, Metropolitan Police, who received the Queen's Police Medal, and sporting stars Kelly Gallagher and Charlotte Evans. Dame Laura Davies is made a Dame Commander of the British Empire, having been awarded an MBE and CBE in previous honours . Paralympic gold medallist Kelly Gallagher (left) and Charlotte Evans (right, guide to Paralympic Skier Kelly Gallagher)  spoke of their 'delight' after they were awarded MBEs for services to sport . The pair were awarded MBEs following their historic victory at the Winter Paralympics. Gallagher, a visually impaired skier, and Evans, her sighted partner, became the first Britons to win an Olympic or Paralympic title on snow when they came first in the women's visually impaired Super-G event in Sochi, Russia, earlier this year. Speaking after the Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony hosted by the Princess Royal, Gallagher said: 'We've been really lucky to win a Paralympic medal but to be honoured in this way is incredible.' Evans, who guides her sports partner by skiing ahead and communicating via a headset as they travel at speeds of up to 75mph, said 'I don't think anything compares to it.' Britain's most accomplished female golfer Laura Davies was also made a Dame. The sportswoman, a professional since the mid-1980s, has already been awarded an MBE and CBE in previous honours. Dame Laura said: 'This is my 30th year on tour and I'm still going strong. I was in Malaysia on Sunday, then I fly back out to China for the next tournament - it's all go. Queen Elizabeth holds an audience with Dame Marguerite Pindling upon her appointment as Governor-General of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas . 'I just love to compete, I love to try and win and I still play well - there's nothing more I would rather be doing.' The sportswoman described her first major as the highlight of her career: 'I think the US Open in 1987 when I wasn't even a member of the tour in America and went over there as complete unknown and came back with a major trophy. 'I guess that was the big one that got everything going for me.'","Queen Elizabeth held an audience with Dame Marguerite Pindling .

"Robert Reichl, 50, who died after he was lured onto a rooftop in Sunset Park with the promise of sex . A man tricked onto the top of a four-story building by women who said they would sleep with him was attacked by three men before falling to the ground. Robert Reichl, 50, from Bay Ridge in Brooklyn, climbed to the top of the building on Fourth Avenue near 47th St in Sunset Park after he was promised sex by two women, police said. Instead, he was set upon by a group of men who robbed him of $2,000 and sprayed him with mace, causing him to fall backwards off the roof. Mr Reichl, who worked for his family's real estate business, landed in the rear courtyard of the building and was pronounced dead at the scene following the ambush which occurred shortly after midnight on Wednesday. His family have told police they had last seen him on Monday, and that he went out on Tuesday to pay some builders for repair work they had done on property owned by the Reichl family. Police say Mr Reichl was seen drinking with young people on the sidewalk outside the building late that night, and later still went up onto the roof with two women, where he undressed. They believe the women went through his pockets and stole the cash before running downstairs.  Then they believe three men went up to the roof and stole other items from Mr Reichl before one of them sprayed him in the face. Police have arrested three people in connection with the incident: Ruben Santiago, 23, Glennys Reyes, 23, and Randy Ortiz, 24. Sources told the New York Daily News that police believe Reyes was one of the women who seduced Mr Reichl onto the building and lifted the money from him pocket. Investigators believe Santiago sprayed him in the face with the substance believed to be mace, causing him to stumble and fall of the building, while Ortiz was also on the roof. The third man and second woman are currently being hunted. Reyes and Ortiz have been charged with grand larceny while Santiago has been charged with second-degree murder and robbery, it was reported. Mr Reichl did not have a wife or children but is survived by his mother, Mary Reichl, and sister Ingrid Reichl. Miss Reichl told the New York Times that her brother was planning to go with her and her children to Disney World next month. She said: 'My children lost their uncle who acted like a father to them.' Mr Reichl fell to his death after he was tricked into climbing onto the roof of the four-story building by two women .","Robert Reichl, 50, from Brooklyn, fell after he was sprayed with mace .

"Greece is planning to pursue a long-dormant claim for reparations from Germany over Nazi occupation during World War Two, it emerged today. Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos told parliament today that the government was willing to 'exhaust every means available' in its claim. News of the debt-stricken country's bid for reparations will add to the already strained relationship with Berlin, which foots most of the bill for Greece's 240-billion euro rescue. Controversial: Greece is planning to pursue a long-dormant claim for reparations from Germany over Nazi occupation during World War Two, it emerged today. This is a picture of Greek capital Athens . Germany, whose forces occupied Greece in World War Two, says it has already paid all reparations owed. Mr Avramopoulos said today that the Greek Finance Ministry has compiled a report after studying documents spanning more than six decades. It will be submitted to Greece's legal advisers and then Athens will decide how to officially press its claim, he said. Mr Avramopoulos did not say how much would be sought. 'We will exhaust every means available to arrive to a result,' he told lawmakers. 'One can't compare the times, but also not erase the memories.' The issue has resurfaced since last year as Greece suffers under austerity measures imposed on it by its creditors, mainly Germany, as a condition for its international EU/IMF bailout. Strain: News of the debt-stricken country's bid for reparations will add to the already strained relationship with Berlin. Greek PM Antonis Samaras is pictured left, while  German Chancellor Angela Merkel is right . Occupation: German soldiers raise the Nazi flag at the Acropolis during the Second World War . Mr Avramopoulos said it was wrong to link the issue to the debt crisis. 'This has been an open issue for 60 years, it is too large an issue to fit into the confines of the fiscal crisis,' he said. Greece's fragile coalition government has so far earned praise from Chancellor Angela Merkel for starting to fix Greece's finances. But conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras was pushed to raise the reparation issue by the main opposition, anti-bailout Syriza party.","Foreign Minister says government willing to 'exhaust every .

"The man stabbed to death with a stiletto heel over the weekend has been identified as a professor at the University of Houston, authorities announced today. The victim, identified as 59-year-old Alf Stefan Andersson, worked at the University of Houston Center for Nuclear Receptors and Cell Signaling where he focused on women's reproductive health. He'd been with the university since 2009. Fashion victim: the man stabbed to death with a stiletto heel has been identified as University of Houston professor Alf Stefon Andersson . The details of the relationship between Andersson and the suspect, 44-year-old Ana Lilia Trujillo, remain unclear as authorities continue to investigate the vicious attack. ""The University of Houston community is saddened to learn of the tragic death of Professor Stefan Andersson. Our hearts go out to his colleagues, family and friends during this difficult time,"" the university said in a statement released today. Houston woman Ana Trujillo, 44, was arrested after police found her boyfriend with multiple stab wounds to the head . Her boyfriend was found lying on the floor. She is now being held on $100,000 bond . According to authorities, police were called to the Parklane Building - a luxury condominium building popular amongst professors at the nearby university - in the 1,700 block of Herman Drive in Houston's Theater District about 4 a.m. Sunday in response to an assault in progress. When police got to the 18th floor condo, Trujillo opened the door and let officers into the unit, which is where they found Andersson in a hallway between the entryway and the kitchen. Authorities say he was stabbed multiple times, each time, apparently, with a stiletto shoe. Trujillo was the only one present when the body was discovered. Crime scene: authorities say a Houston woman stabbed a man to death with a stiletto heel at this condominium complex . Houston police tell ABC13 that Trujillo initially was cooperative with detectives, but later stopped talking as she was taken to a precinct for additional questioning. Investigators say Trujillo doesn't live in the building and appears to have just been visiting. Hotel staff told authorities she appears to have arrived last night. A motive for the slaying is unclear. Trujillo is scheduled to be in Harris County District Court on Tuesday for her initial appearance. She currently is being held on $100,000 bond.","The victim has been identified as University of Houston professor Alf Stefan Andersson .

"Bare facts: Naked rambler Stephen Gough has lost his appeal at the European Court of Human Rights . At last, the Naked Rambler has reached the end of the road. After almost a decade in and out of prison, Britain’s most surprising inmate — real name Stephen Gough — has lost his chance of freedom at the European Court Of Human Rights in Strasbourg. He must now keep serving his two-and-a-half-year sentence in Winchester Prison for breaching an indefinite Asbo against being naked in public. The former Royal Marine from Eastleigh, Hampshire, had claimed the right to remain naked under Articles Eight and Ten of the European Convention On Human Rights: the right to freedom of expression and the right to a private life. The Court — normally so indulgent of all sorts of crackpot human rights dreamt up by greedy lawyers — accepted that the 54-year-old had a right to freedom of expression; and that the ‘acceptance of public nudity in a modern society is a matter of public interest’. The judges did not accept that this gave him the right to strip off in public. Nor did they agree his cycle of imprisonment, freedom and imprisonment violated his rights. Is he cowed? Not a bit of it. When Gough next steps outside Winchester Prison, you can bet he’ll still be in his birthday suit. He even insists on going naked in jail, which is why he has spent much of his prison time in solitary confinement. ‘I expected them to take the wider view,’ he said on hearing the verdict. ‘They have not. Then again, what great endeavour ever succeeded without having to surmount many obstacles that stood in its way? Why should it be any different for me? I have no choice but to continue.’ Gough, the son of a carpenter, left the Marines at 21 to explore Thailand and take up Buddhism, and then join the Moonies. ‘I was looking for the answer,’ he said — but eventually came back to live in Hampshire, working as a lorry driver. Now, his life is dedicated to the open road — with no clothes on. He first started walking naked in Canada, where he’d moved for a spell with his partner and two children. As he has put it, one day he had an ‘epiphany’: that he was ‘good’ on a fundamental level — as was his naked body, too. He embarked on his public naked campaign in Britain in 2003, on a nude walk from Land’s End to John O’Groats during which he was arrested 15 times and imprisoned for 140 nights. That didn’t stop him doing the same walk — and being arrested and imprisoned all over again — in 2005. On the most recent occasion he was released, in April this year, he strolled out of Winchester Prison wearing only his shoes and was promptly rearrested for breaching a pre-existing Asbo, which had been imposed in 2013. He was convicted over that matter last month, leading to his current two-and-a-half- year sentence. Mr Gough is pretty hardline about nudism. He feels it’s something of a mission — and certainly not an activity to be confined behind closed doors. ‘I stand for freedom,’ he has claimed. ‘Some people heat up their house especially so they can go naked and I think that’s nuts.’ Others fear that description might better apply to him. Even his own mother, Nora, has never understood his motivation. ‘I know it’s something to do with freedom but he’s not free, is he? Stuck in jail,’ she commented earlier this year. Certainly, Gough has forfeited a normal life: wife, family, career. Before prison, he had no obvious source of income, describing his naked antics as his version of ‘getting a proper job’, and reportedly sleeping rough on his rambles. His two children are teenagers, and he is no longer with their mother. During a 2012 court appearance he broke down in tears, saying: ‘There’s nothing about me as a human being that is indecent or alarming or offensive. That’s where I’m coming from, which is deep inside.’ It takes around £65,000 to imprison a person in Britain, after police and court costs are taken into account; the actual prison term then costs around £40,000 a year. Over the past 11 years, Gough has been arrested more than 50 times. Practically every time he walks out of prison, he is arrested again for being naked. And whenever he appears in court, it is normally an extended hearing because of his refusal to wear clothes — which can lead to extra contempt of court charges. Stubborn: Practically every time Gough walks out of prison, he is arrested again for being naked. And whenever he appears in court, it is normally an extended hearing because of his refusal to wear clothes . At a conservative estimate, more than half a million pounds has been spent on convicting and jailing him. The waste of police and court time has been immense, too, at a time when the judicial, policing and prison system is severely overstretched. He is currently among 85,720 people behind bars in Britain. Meanwhile, his lawyers say there’s been ‘no discussion, certainly no ruling, on Stephen’s mental health’. In Britain, there is no single, simple law against public nudity. That means you’re not immediately breaking the law if you go skinny-dipping on your summer holidays. Naturism, too, is allowed by the law, which exempts those ‘whose intention is limited to going about his or her lawful business naked’ from prosecution under the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. That Act rightly outlaws flashing — the exposure of your genitals with the intention of causing harm or distress. Naturists are also exempted from the laws on outraging public decency, under which you can be prosecuted for public acts of a lewd, obscene or disgusting nature. But Gough doesn’t think of himself as a naturist, nor do naturists think he is one of them. Where Gough runs into trouble is under the Public Order Act 1986, which criminalises ‘disorderly behaviour within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress’. With this Act, Gough’s own intentions are neither here nor there. What matters is the effect on other people’s minds. Dedicated: Before prison, Gough had no obvious source of income, describing his naked antics as his version of ‘getting a proper job’, and reportedly sleeping rough on his rambles . Understandably, parents of small children are particularly alarmed when Gough comes striding along, naked except for his boots, socks and, on sunny days, a hat. On these occasions, he is often his own worst enemy. ‘How can nature expressed in human form be indecent?’ he said on hearing that his appeal had failed in Europe. ‘Yet it is these absurd beliefs that form the underlying assumptions of the countless criminal charges and convictions against me, resulting in over nine years in solitary confinement in British prisons.’ The European Court case goes back to an incident in 2011, when he was asked by two policemen in Perth to put his clothes on. He had just walked out of HM Prison Perth — naked, of course. When the case got to court, he again appeared naked and refused to heed the sheriff’s warnings that he would be held in contempt if he didn’t get dressed. The sheriff duly sentenced him to 330 days for breach of the peace and 90 days for the contempt charge, along with 237 days unspent from a previous sentence — a total of one year, nine months and 18 days. And, as the law stands, complicated as it is, the conclusion is clear — Gough will go on being arrested until he puts his pants back on. Gough’s lawyer, Mike Schwarz of firm Bindmans, acknowledges this is the case. ‘As the law stands, even if there’s no one around to be offended, he could go to prison for several years. In our view, that’s disproportionate.’ His client, he expects, will probably be released from his current sentence in a year and a half — and is ‘pretty set’ on continuing his campaign. Indeed, Gough’s lawyers are now launching an appeal against his conviction for breaching his ASBO, on the basis that he was not allowed to appear naked in court to defend himself. Perhaps Gough’s mad, inconvenient but single-minded crusade will eventually force the police and courts to reconsider those endless prosecutions. After all, who breaks a naked butterfly on a wheel?","Stephen Gough just lost his last chance at freedom at human rights court .

"Ho Chi Minh attracts thousands of adventurous travellers each year, who head to Vietnam's largest city to experience the French colonial architecture, life on the bustling Saigon river and - of course - the world-famous cuisine. But today there is a surprising new addition to Ho Chi Minh's culinary offerings as the glowing yellow arches of McDonald's take their place on the city's skyline. America's most famous fast food joint set up its first outlet in Vietnam last month and has already served over 400,000 people, according to business reports out this week. Old and new: Vietnam's largest city Ho Chi Minh has opened its first McDonald's . Heading up the Asian franchise company in charge of the export is the Prime Minister's son-in-law Henry Nguyen, who spent time flipping burgers in the USA as a teenager and says that it has always been his dream to open a McDonald's in his home country. The outlet opened to a hungry crowd on Feb 8, and within 24 hours had served almost 22,500 customers. Golden arches: Photographer Neil Massey documented launch day on Feb 8 . Ngyeun, who is married to the daughter of the Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, . told investors on Tuesday that 61,980 Big Macs were sold in its first 30 days of . business and that the number of customers had already exceeded 'even . what we thought were pretty high expectations.' A visit to the western restaurant chain is seen as a treat for regular Vietnamese families. British photographer Neil Massey who was there to capture the hectic opening event, told FeatureShoot.com: 'For most Vietnamese youngsters the chance to work at an international company like McDonald’s is a big deal. For the customers it’s the aspirational experience that brings them through the doors. Contrast: Following the relaxing of investment restrictions in 2013 Ho Chi Minh has welcomed several western food and drink companies including Starbucks and KFC . 'The average wage in Vietnam is about US$150 a month; the cost of a Big Mac is US$2.82 and a Value Meal is US$3.99. So, for many Vietnamese, it’s a special treat to bring the family to a place like this. 'Last year Vietnam relaxed its investment restrictions, and since then it has seen big brands like Burger King and Starbucks come into Vietnam. Starbucks was a big deal on its opening weekend, but nothing compared to this.' McDonald's is the latest Western brand to make forays into the communist country following in the footsteps of Starbucks, Subway, Burger King and KFC.","First outlet opened in Ho Chi Minh City in February .

"The aunt of Kim Jong-un has been credited with being the driving force behind the rise of the Supreme Leader of North Korea. Kim Kyong-hui, who is often the only female face on official photographs of ranks of generals and party leaders, has been tasked with transforming her nephew into a figurehead with a reputation for strong military tactics who is able to handle an international crisis. Miss Kim, who has been a key figure in the family for four decades, and her husband Jang Sung-taek, were chosen by Kim Jong-il to pull the strings behind the consolidation of his son's authority before the old leader died in 2011, The Telegraph has reported. Kim Kyong-hui (pictured on an escalator in a Pyongyang supermarket with a group including Kim Jong-un and her husband Jang Song-taek) has been described as the driving force behind the Supreme Leader's rise to power . Kim Kyong-hui (centre) has been a key figure in the family, which rules the country, for four decades . The pair, who are both 66,  were seen on either side of Kim Jong-un at a central committee session of the Workers' Party last weekend, where their nephew pledged to maintain nuclear weapons as 'the nation's life treasure'. The following week saw escalating tensions as Mr Kim threatened the US and South Korea. Miss Kim, daughter of the Eternal President of Kim Il-sung, who oversaw the inception of North Korea in 1948, is the director of the party's Organisation and Guidance Department. She is also the sister of the country's second leader and now aunt of its third. Her husband, meanwhile, is vice-chairman of the National Defence Commission. He is also the regime's key link with China. According to The Telegraph however, their main role is to help defend the dynasty by pushing the young leader's image as a powerful military figure. There are apparently concerns he is not trusted by some of his generals. The pair were seen on either side of Kim Jong-un at a central committee session of the Workers' Party last weekend .

"Tesca Fitzgerald will be heading off to grad school, but when she finally begins classes at the Georgia Institute of Technology, her classmates will be several years older than her. In college at age 12, Tesca just graduated from Portland State University and is on the fast track to receive her PhD in cognitive science and human robotic interaction by age 22. Her mom Ami Fitzgerald says its all down to their homeschooling that has allowed her daughters the freedom to study at their own speed. Looking to the future: 16-year-old college graduate Tesca Fitzgerald is headed to Georgia next month to start working on her Ph. D . Her parents, Ami and Mark Fitzgerald began homeschooling all of their three daughters early on because they were being bullied. 'I guarantee, if you home school your kids for eight hours a day every day, they’ll be in college at age 12, too,' Ami told The Oregonian. The girls worked through coursework in a summer that would take other students an entire year to understand. Tesca skipped middle school and high school and instead enrolled in college at the age of 12. That . transition into college took some getting used to, Tesca says, both for . herself and for her classmates, who were not used to the idea of a . 12-year-old taking advanced math courses. Not your average teen:  Those who know Tesca well say she is always fun to be around and  likes to try new things . 'It was a love/hate relationship,' she says. 'It was a great new class that I looked forward to, but I kept getting the same questions from students day after day.' By the end of the year, however, the novelty of her presence wore off, Tesca told The Times. 'Now, most people don’t say anything,' she adds. 'They think I’m 19 or 20, most of the time.' She says that she doesn't miss skipping out on the 'traditional high school experience.' 'I ask people about if they enjoyed high school or wish they had skipped it, and I get answers both ways,' Tesca says. 'I liked the way that things turned out for me, and I wouldn’t change anything if I could go back.' Tesca says she has always been drawn to computers, like her father, a computer programmer. Fast learner: At age 8, a pony-tailed Tesca Fitzgerald made a chess move in a game against her big sister, Tayt. The two super-smart sisters went through high school, Portland Community College and Portland State University together . We are family: Tesca (right) with her two sisters and mom, Ami . 'There was always some computer or something around to play with,' she says. She says that she is especially excited to work with human-robotic interactions and wants to start studying cognitive science. 'It is something that I have always found fascinating,' she says. 'We will never fully understand how the brain works. It’s the kind of field that you could start learning and never get to the end of it because we don’t know, and it ties in closely to computer science and artificial intelligence.' She just graduated from Portland State University with honors in computer science and will pursue a doctorate in the same field at Georgia Tech for the next six years. She chose Georgia Tech because it offers a computer science specialty called interactive computing that will allow her to delve into cognitive science, neuroscience and other interdisciplinary arenas. 'My passion lies in finding new solutions to new problems,' she says. Not only is Ms. Fitzgerald a genius, but she also has a knack for artificial intelligence. 'It was because I wanted to do something different that nobody had done before.' At the age of 15-years-old, Fitzgerald worked 600 hours to create her own artificially intelligent robot who could make its own decisions and operate itself. I've got all my sisters with me: Tesca, 16, (left), Tayt, 19, (center) and Ty Fitzgerald (right), 13, are some of the smartest kids around. Tesca and Tayt graduated from Portland State University last week. Ty said she plans to do the same . Before that, Tesca also attended the coveted Google Science Fair as a keynote speaker in 2011. After building her mini-robot zenith, designers of the robotics program flew from Europe to meet with Tesca Fitzgerald to learn more on how she pushed the limits of their software to create such an exceptional feat. Her talent for computing showed early, thanks in part to an unusual home environment. Her parents, both with MBAs, worked at home a lot, half time for her trust-manager mom, Ami, full time for her self-taught database designer dad, Mark. He had a lot of computers, enough that all three daughters could bang around on them from infancy and got one of their own as preschoolers. Colorful character: Tesca Fitzgerald, left, then a 14-year-old community college student, took part in a state robotics competition with friends . One scene from a plane, as recalled by Ami Fitzgerald: When Tesca was not yet 2, she and her mother took a flight, each with her own laptop, unusual for a toddler in the 1990s. While Ami worked, Tesca played a simple interactive game, appearing to deftly use the computer as she sucked on her pacifier. Other passengers gaped. At landing time, mother told daughter to shut down her computer, and she did. But Ami struggled to get hers off, even after she yanked out the battery pack. A flustered flight attendant insisted she shut it down. From the back of the plane, a chorus of voices shouted: 'Ask the baby.' Fitzgerald passed the laptop to Tesca, who did, indeed, turn it off. 'The whole back of the plane erupted,' Ami Fitzgerald says. Good friends: Tesca (second from left), says she doesn't mind having skipped out on high school . The program Tesca played was a Reader Rabbit game designed to teach 4- to 6-year-olds letters, sounds and words. Her parents assumed she was just enjoying the goofy graphics and punching random keys. Tesca, not yet 3, said what any little sister might: 'My turn.' Then, to her mother's astonishment, 'She read and read and read. Every book you could put in front of her, she could read.' At age 2, with help only from Reader Rabbit, she had cracked the code. Dad, Mark, says he is proud of his daughter and everything she has accomplished. 'When your kid graduate from college, it’s always a proud moment,' he says. 'But the fact that they are going to grad school is also very inspiring for us. And the fact she is at such a young age too.' But, he adds, watching Tesca graduate was a bittersweet moment. 'The trouble with having a girls a smart as her is that you have to see them advance a lot sooner than you were planning,' he laughs. 'You have to deal with it.'","Tesca Fitzgerald began to play with computers at before the age of two .

"Snow baby: Anna the fox has lived with Russian scientist Irina Mukhamedshina since she was a cub. She understands as many commands as a pet dog . Like any well-behaved pet, she understands words such as 'sit', 'stand up', 'lie down' - and knows her own name. But Anna is no ordinary domesticated animal. She is an endearing and impeccably mannered fox who has been trained to live alongside humans. The woman responsible for her unlikely transformation is Irina Mukhamedshina, a 22-year-old Russian scientist who adopted her and another fox called Elma from  the Novosibirsk of Cytology and Genetics, which has studied how animals evolved from their feral ancestors to live alongside humans. She saw animals at the institute, . which began taming foxes in the 1950s and now has more than 50 . generations in its breeding programme, waggling their tails and . clamouring for human attention in the same way as dogs and wondered if . they could also be trained like them. Both her subjects were tiny cubs when they came to her but quickly grew into a companion that Irina views as halfway between a cat and a dog. 'I needed them to be young, because then I could use food motivation to train some basic commands,' Irina, an experienced dog trainer, told The Siberian Times. Her first task was getting the animals to come close to her, a process she found easy. After . this she moved on to basic commands, which took the foxes three weeks of 15 minute sessions . to master. They soon began to recognise their own names and would come to her for affection. Her . work attracted international fascination. A Japanese film crew recorded . Irina's work with foxes and were amazed at her achievements. She has now written an essay on her experiences and hopes to continue exploring the ways that foxes can be trained. Some . of the foxes, like Anna, have been sold to curious animal lovers. Others have been sold to fur farms because they are less distressed in captivity. She . said: 'Psychologically I understand them better now. Tamed foxes are . not quite like dogs, they are more in between dogs and cats in how they . respond to humans.' The Cytology and Genetics farm is in . Akademgorodok, the academic region of Siberia's largest city, . Novosibirsk. It is unique in the world as it has several hundred tamed . foxes. Its groundbreaking work began in the . 1950s, when Soviet biologist Dmitry Belyaev gathered foxes from fur . farms and bred the friendliest and least ferocious animals. He wanted to . test a theory by Charles Darwin that domestication physically changes . animals. By the mid-1960s, the foxes had gone . from wild to not fearing humans to actively seeking to befriend them. His team started to notice not only behavioural changes such as wagging . their tails and licking their human caretakers to show affection, . but also physical changes, such as spotted coats, floppy ears, and . curled tails. The effect has been dubbed the domestication phenotype. His . research drew the ire of Cold War politicians, who saw genetics as a . western science, and he was lucky to be able to continue his work until . his death in 1985, when it was taken over by Irina’s mentor Dr Lyudmila Trut.

It is a replica of the British Navy's original HMS Bounty on which the famous mutiny took place in Tahiti in . 1789 and is now used as a sailing school for prospective seafarers. It was built using the original ship drawings from files in the . British admiralty archives, but its dimensions were enlarged by around a third to fit the enormous 70 mm cameras used in the filming. Some 400,000 feet of lumber were used, 10,000 square yards of canvas were . sewn by hand and 10 miles of rope were rigged before it was ready for the silver screen.

Fears: The coast guard had to let the historic replica sink to the bottom of the ocean because conditions became too dangerous for a rescue . Testing: U.S. Navy sailors from the submarine USS Mississippi test the wheel earlier this month during a sail aboard the square rigged sailing ship HMS Bounty . The plan was to burn the ship in a dramatic final act, but Marlon Brando had become so attached to the vessel that he threatened to walk out in protest so, rather than lose their star, its owners MGM agreed to keep it in service. It has since become one of Hollywood's most famous ships and was used in filming for the 1989 film Treasure Island with Charlton Heston and also appeared in two of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, both starring Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley. This year it was put up for sale by its current owners for $4.6 million. 'Bounty': It is an exact replica of the British Navy's original HMS Bounty on which the famous mutiny took place in Tahiti in 1789 . The mutiny that took place aboard the original Bounty is one of the most famous of all seafaring tales. It was led by Fletcher Christian, played in the 1962 film by Marlon Brando, against commanding officer Lieutenant William Bligh, played by Trevor Howard, on  28 April 1789. According to most reports, the crew had become fed up with the rod of iron with which Lt. Bligh commanded the ship and decided overthrow him to start new lives on the Pacific Islands. They rounded up Lt Bligh and a handful of his loyal seamen and set them afloat in a dinghy leaving them to their fate. The men then settled in on Pitcairn Island and in Tahiti before burning HMS Bounty to avoid detection where many of their descendants remain to this day.

"A 20-year-old New York college student is facing heaps of Internet scorn after she published an essay demanding that poor people stop making her feel bad because she's so rich. Rachael Sacks describes how a cashier at her local grocery store in the affluent West Village neighborhood was unfriendly and frowned at her because she was carrying a large shopping bag from the high-end handbag designer Mulberry. 'I am sorry that I was born into great financial circumstances and my father likes to provide for me. I am sorry I don’t have to go to a state school to save my parents money. What do you want from me?' she writes in an essay, published on Thursday, for Thought Catalog. Scorned: Rachael Sacks, 20, has received endless online vitriol over her essay about her privileged background . Sacks attends the New School's Eugene Lang Liberal Arts College - one of the most expensive universities in the country . Sacks is seen here with her father, Dr Preston Sacks, a prominent fertility doctor in Bethesda, Maryland . 'People shouldn’t make others feel bad about their own personal finances. How people spend their money is their own choice.' She continues: 'It just seems really petty and makes you look bitter and unhappy with your own life if you are casting nasty glares at college girls in Gristedes because you’re a cashier.' The 20-year-old then argues: 'I’m not one of those people who try to be poor to relate to people. 'I think that’s honestly really disgusting behavior, it’s as if you’re saying that you have to make yourself into something you think is beneath you to get others to like you.' She later claims she had no idea that she was rich while growing up because her family went to McDonalds and she wore clothes from Old Navy. She added: 'I went to private school when I was younger and there would always be someone so much richer than me. 'There were kids who owned their own horses and whose parents were billionaires, so I had no idea that I had any money until I was about 14 and people called me ''Rachael Sacks of Cash''.

On her blog, her ambition is stated as: 'Working on my goal of being a rich eccentric old person by writing a lot of things.' Calls to a cell phone number for Miss Sacks went to answerphone when contacted by MailOnline today. Her . younger sister Caroline told MailOnline today that her sister is . currently in New York and going to school. She said that she was unaware . if her sister had any part-time work or internships. Within hours, Miss Sacks was flooded with deriding, mocking comments from people who didn't appreciate her take on wealth. 'Yes, let's all pity and feel bad for poor, judged, not smiled at,' one twitter user commented sarcastically. A commenter on her story wrote: 'What a spoiled brat.

"Two new earthquakes - the biggest so far - shook Iceland's Barbarbunga volcano today as the country remained on alert for a major eruption. Iceland's Meteorological Office said the quakes in the early hours had a magnitude of 5.3 and 5.1, an escalation in strength after thousands of tremors shook the volcano over the last week. It prompted further fears that the volcano could erupt, spewing ash into the atmosphere in an echo of the cloud which caused chaotic flight delays throughout Europe in April 2010. Uncertainty: The two largest earthquakes so far were recorded at the Barbarbunga volcano in Iceland after a red alert was issued for flights. This afternoon the alert was downgraded to orange, but activity continued . Road closed: Residents were advised to stay away from the volcano and a no-fly zone was introduced . Yesterday Iceland's authorities issued a red alert for aviation - the highest on a five-point scale. A no-fly zone was declared as a precaution measuring 100 nautical miles by 140 nautical miles (185 kilometers by 260 kilometers) around the epicentre of the quakes. This afternoon the risk was downgraded to orange after authorities said there were no signs of an imminent eruption. However, Iceland's Civil Protection Department said seismic activity continued underneath the huge glacier which has been the focus of the quakes. The volcano is in a mountain range on the southern part of the island underneath the vast Vatnajokull glacier. Not a good time for a walk: Magma is flowing beneath the volcano and could come to the surface. Iceland's authorities said this afternoon an eruption did not appear imminent but they were keeping a close watch . Restless sleep: The vast glacier today. Some trans-Atlantic flights have been diverted as a precaution . Seismologists said yesterday that magma was moving under the glacier but so far had travelled horizontally at a depth of 3 to 6 miles. The volcano will erupt if the magma melts the ice above. On Saturday scientists reported a small eruption under the ice, but it was not visible on the surface, and the Met Office later said it appeared to have stopped. Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said air travel would not be affected until an eruption actually breaks the ice. A spokesman said: 'The Met Office will be monitoring what's occurring. They will be sending out forecasts about the atmosphere and any ash in the air. 'If the eruption does occur we will issue what's called a notice to airmen informing them of the conditions. It's then up to the airlines with their safety teams and experts whether to fly.' A 2010 eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokul volcano caused a week of international aviation chaos, with more than 100,000 flights cancelled. Dramatic landscape: Iceland's snow-capped peaks conceal a high number of active volcanoes . Chaos: More than 100,000 flights were cancelled when the Eyjafjallajokul volcano erupted in 2010 (pictured) Aviation officials closed Europe's air space for five days out of fear that volcanic ash could harm jet engines. Any new eruption is likely to be less disruptive because European aviation authorities have changed their policy in the wake of the chaos. Airlines now receive detailed information about the location and density of ash clouds, although decisions on whether to fly are still left to them and national regulators. Britain's National Air Traffic Service said it was monitoring what it called a 'dynamic situation' but was expecting normal operations today. However, alternative flight paths were being used across the Atlantic as a precaution. Virgin Atlantic also said a London-to-San Francisco flight took a slight detour yesterday to avoid Iceland's no-fly zone.","Quakes in early hours today had magnitude of 5.3 and 5.1, largest so far .

"As an American strike on Syria becomes more and more likely, so does the chance that the U.S. will be fighting on the same side as Al-Qaeda for the first time ever. Syria’s President Bashar Hafez al-Assad, after all, counts the terrorist group that claimed responsibility for the September 11 attacks among his enemies. And without intending it, an American intervention into Syria’s civil war also has the potential to not just aid Al-Qaeda allies, but also to help arm them. Scroll down for video . Allies: U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Tuesday that American forces are prepared to strike against Syria at a moment's notice, which places U.S. on the same side as its bitter enemy Al-Qaeda for the first time in history . Common enemy: Both the U.S. and Al-Qaeda affiliates seek to retaliate, albeit in different ways, against Syria's use of chemical weapons . Among the voices in the West speaking out against a strike on Syria is English journalist Robert Fisk. The Middle East correspondent for The Independent penned a column in the U.K. publication Tuesday titled Does Obama know he’s fighting on al-Qa’ida’s side? in which he described a scenario where the U.S. and its enemies become convenient allies, at least within the confines of Syria. ‘Maybe the Americans should ask al-Qa’ida for intelligence help,’ writes Fisk. ‘After all, this is the group with “boots on the ground”, something the Americans have no interest in doing. And maybe al-Qa’ida could offer some target information facilities to the country which usually claims that the supporters of al-Qa’ida, rather than the Syrians, are the most wanted men in the world.’ Though colorful at times, the picture Fisk paints is composed of stark, black and white realities. Just this week, an Al-Qaeda affiliated rebel group’s commander in Syria has pledged to target communities of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite minority with rockets in revenge for the alleged chemical attack near Damascus. ‘For every chemical rocket that has fallen on our people in Damascus, one of their villages will, by the will of God, pay for it,’ Abu Mohammad al-Golani of the al-Nusra Front said in the recording posted on YouTube. ‘On top of that we will prepare a thousand rockets that will be fired on their towns in revenge for the Damascus Ghouta massacre.’ Warning: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is among the high-ranking officials leaving little doubt that chemical weapons were used against Syria's enemies, including Al-Qaeda . The Syrian opposition has accused government forces of an attack on insurgent-held suburbs of the capital last week where poison gas appears to have killed hundreds of people. ‘To the bereaved mothers of the children and the people of Ghouta, I say that your blood is a debt that we and every mujahid (Islamic holy fighter) have to pay,’ Golani said in the recording entitled, An eye for an eye. Nusra's Sunni Muslim fighters have claimed responsibility for the deadliest bombings in the two-and-a-half-year-old Syrian conflict and their brigades have led some of the most successful rebel offensives against Assad's forces. The group has been formally designated a terrorist organization by the United States, a step which Washington said was vindicated by a declaration in April that it was merging with al Qaeda's Islamic State of Iraq group. Washington now says Nusra is little more than a front for al Qaeda. That effectively squares the goals of the U.S. and of the terrorist group. Ready to strike: The guided-missile destroyer USS Ramage is one of four positioned in the Mediterranean Sea and prepared to strike several Syrian locations with Tomahawk missiles . 'Up for grabs and up for sale': CIA second in command Michael Morell said this month that he fears toppling the Syrian government will help arm their enemies, most notably the Al Nusra Front, an Al-Qaeda backed group . ‘This, of course, will not be trumpeted by the Pentagon or the White House – nor, I suppose, by al-Qa’ida,’ Fisk writes. ‘But it does raise some interesting possibilities.’ One such possibility was posed by the CIA’s second-in-command Michael Morell, who believes that toppling Assad—which, it should be said, the U.S. has never said it would try to do with a strike on Syria—would be a field day for Al-Qaeda. Morell told the Wall Street Journal that the Syrian government’s weapons ‘are going to be up for grabs and up for sale’ should Assad fall. And while the U.S. is distracted, Morell believes Al-Qaeda could take advantage. ‘If we don't keep the pressure on them, they will reconstitute,’ he said. ‘I worry about complacency in the face of that.'","Both the U.S. and Al-Qaeda want the Syrian government to pay for the alleged use of chemical weapons .

"An alleged North Korean propaganda video has emerged online that claims Americans drink 'hot snow' as coffee, live in tents and eat wild birds on Tuesdays, . The four-minute film portrays people in the U.S. as living in extreme poverty, who are lucky to have a floor to sleep on and live on a diet of 'local snow'. The supposedly North Korean narrator - . 'translated' on the film by a British man - tells viewers: 'This is how Americans live today.' Scroll down for video . Poverty: It is repeatedly said Americans have to drink coffee made from snow and are grateful for the handouts . Gun-toting: The narrator said that Americans use guns to shoot one another and especially children . Body bags: These two friends sit next to blue plastic bags filled with dead bodies, according to the film . The authenticity of the video has . been doubted and many believe it is a clever spoof done in the style of . official North Korean propaganda videos. The 'propaganda' film has already been viewed thousands of times in the three days since it was uploaded. It features clips of poverty, cold and hardship. The narrator tells viewers: 'This is how they live in modern day. Huddled together - the . poor, the cold, the lonely and the homosexuals.' The bizarre video appears to use footage from the aftermath of natural disasters filmed around the world. Many of the clips seem to have been shot in Europe, and Paris' famous Gard de Nord station is seen in one image. Drug use: This man is 'awaiting heroin', the narrator tells viewers . Charity: Many Americans live in tents donated by the North Korea as their own homes have fallen down . But the narrator explains this as other parts of America that 'disguise' themselves as foreign cities. Either way she says they live a 'terrible life'. It is said that Americans have to . live in tents donated by North Korea and take handouts of snow coffee . because their houses 'blow down easily.' Among the fantastical . claims made in the video are that Americans have eaten the bird . population almost to extinction. The 'yummy birds' that remain in the . trees will be eaten on Tuesday, according to the narrator. When the film shows a man . walking through the snow in what appears to be Paris, the narrator says: 'This man is a former . Republican candidate for Oregon who is now having to get coffee made of . snow.' The video also features two elderly men sitting on a bench surrounded by plastic bags. Donations: Americans are said to be very grateful for their one cup a day of snow coffee . Lucky: The narrator says these people are considered fortunate because they can sleep on the floor indoors . Decline: This man is said to be a former Republican candidate but now has to beg for snow coffee . The narrator tells viewers: 'These . people lie huddled together with their dead friends in blue body bags . with their coffee cups full of local snow. 'They are very good friends that are together in adversity.' The video also accuses Americans of being obsessed with weaponry and buy 'guns to kill each other especially children.' Last month, Pyongyang released a clip on Uriminzokkiri - Korean for 'Our Nation' - which shows Barack Obama and American troops in flames. If genuine, the latest video of . American poverty could be an attempt to divert domestic attention away . from the plight of residents, thousands of whom are believed to be . starving after failed harvests.

"Chris Christie narrowly leads the pack of potential Republican presidential candidates in a poll of New Hampshire residents released Friday, but Mitt Romney crushes the competition when his name is added to the field. Christie, the cantankerous and controversial New Jersey governor, emerged as the most polarizing name on a list of 13 politicians presented during a phone poll between June 19 and July 1. While 46 per cent of New Hampshire Republicans like him, another 36 per cent don't. And he topped the list when GOP respondents were asked who they definitely would not vote for. But with 19 per cent support in a hypothetical presidential primary, Christie has emerged as the flavor-of-the-month front-runner. Christie is in front, but for how long? As his waistline shrinks, his support in early primary states could drop as well . Cheshire cat: Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee, has campaigned in New Hampshire for U.S. Senate candidate Scott Brown, drawing fans wearing his 2012 campaign t-shirts . Its Mitt: Romney emerged as the dominant force in New Hampshire GOP politics on Friday, crushing the competition in a hypothetical 2016 presidential primary matchup . All 13 potential Republican candidates in the WMUR/Granite State Poll have either fed speculation about their plans for 2016 or allowed pundits to place their names in contention. But former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who has said he will not run for president again, comes out far ahead when his name is added to the mix – posting numbers nearly as dominant as Hillary Clinton's in the Democratic field. If he were to get into the race today, polling data show, he would lead Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul by a 39-7 margin. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio would trail behind with 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2 per cent, respectively. 'Look, I'm not surprised that Romney is still well-liked in Hew Hampshire,' a GOP campaign consultant told MailOnline on Friday. 'He was governor right next door, and as President Obama becomes more and more unpopular there's a sense of buyer's remorse.' 'But ultimately, he's just going to suck the oxygen out of the room and that's not too helpful to the people who are actually going to run in 2016.' Without Romney, the second tier reclaims some of that oxygen. Following . Christie's 19 per cent showing comes Paul with 14 per cent, Bush with . 11, Rubio and Huckabee tied at 8, and Cruz and Jindal with 5 percent – . sharing that low perch with Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan.

Rand Paul (L) and Marco Rubio (C), and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) round out the main group of also-rans . Hey, girl: Rep. Paul Ryan, who shared the GOP ticket with Mitt Romney in 2012, is the candidate with the highest favorability ratings among New Hampshire Republicans . The affable budget hawk is liked by 55 per cent of surveyed Republicans, while just 18 per cent say they view him unfavorably. His net 37 per cent 'likeability' number is a stark contrast with Christie's 10 per cent. The New Jersey governor and Republican Governors Association chairman has his work cut out for him, and has already started making the Granite State a regular stop on his political travel schedule. 'Buyer's remorse': As President Barack Obama's scandals swirl around him, some in New Hampshire have new enthusiasm for his 2012 opponent Mitt Romney . He made a fundraising trip to New Hampshire to support GOP gubernatorial candidate Walt Havenstein in June, just days after phone calls for the poll began. Christie will return for another fundraiser on July 31. But his image has taken significant hits in the past 12 months because of a scandal related to senior staffers' alleged use of the famed George Washington Bridge to create traffic jams in a town whose Democratic mayor declined to endorse his re-election bid. Romney has been in New Hampshire too, campaigning for U.S. Senate candidate Scott Brown. Brown trails Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen by 12 points in the latest poll, doubling an earlier margin. If Brown stumbles in November or fails to win his party's Senate primary, Romney will be seen as damaged goods with limited appeal. And as the man who lost to President Barack Obama, insiders are keenly aware that he might repeat his failure if he ran again. 'It's that old definition of insanity, doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result,' the campaign operative cautioned. The New Hampshire Republican Party declined to comment. Democrats in the New Hampshire poll put former first lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton far ahead of anyone else, but her numbers are beginning to fade. In January a whopping 74 per cent of Democrats polled in New Hampshire said they planned to vote for her in the first-in-the-nation primary. Now that figure is down to 59 per cent, with Vice President Joe Biden coming in a distant second at 14 per cent, followed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren with 8 per cent. Bringing up the rear were Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (5 per cent), New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo  (3 per cent), and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia (1 per cent).","The WMUR/Granite State Poll gives Christie a first-place 19 per cent showing among New Hampshire Republicans .

"A former drug addict has helped kickstart America's newest religious craze - a church where worshippers pretend to get high and worship God in 'drunken glory'. Brandon Barthrop preaches to a congregation of thousands via bizarre YouTube rants, in which he encourages followers to act drunk in order to commune with Jesus. The charismatic religious leader insists that 'there's no high like The Most High' - and he has replaced alcohol and crystal meth with snorting frankincense. Scroll down for video . Visionary? Brandon Barthrop, a former drug addict, is now a leading member of the 'drunken glory' movement . Followers: He now shares a former crackhouse with a number of other addicts turned Christians . Bizarre: The worshippers pretend to 'drink' the Bible and snort imaginary drugs . A new documentary by Vice has lifted the lid on the world of the drunken glory movement, whose meetings are so raucous they are often confused with outrageous nights out. The strange new 'church' was started in the U.S. by preacher John Crowder, but has now spread across the Atlantic to Britain. Mr Crowder has travelled the world holding meetings at which worshippers giggle, shout and even writhe on the floor in an apparent state of intoxication. 'We've been taught in the church that if it feels bad it's good, and if it feels good it's bad - but that's the opposite of the truth,' he said. 'Human beings are made for pleasure.' Watch the documentary: . Leader: Mr Barthrop started taking drugs as a teenager but has since had a religious epiphany . Home: This is the house in a rundown area of Minneapolis where the preacher has set up his ministry . Surreal: A screen grab of the website where Mr Barthrop broadcasts rambling video sermons . One of his most prominent converts was Mr Barthrop, who started taking drugs as a teenager due to his traumatic childhood. He claims he was kidnapped twice by his father following a bitter custody battle between his parents, and lived in 24 different states while growing up. The situation became so desperate that his father ended up telling police that Brandon had attacked him, in an attempt to have him arrested so he would have to stop taking drugs. While in rehab Mr Barthrop had a religious epiphany, and he then set up Red Letter Ministries to promote his message. Inspiration: The movement was started by John Crowder, pictured, a well-known evangelical preacher . Experience: The scene at Mr Crowder's meeting in Essex, where he encouraged the congregation to act drunk . Ecstasy: Worshippers in Essex holding their hands to the air and swaying at Mr Crowder's meeting . He took over a former crackhouse in Minneapolis, Minnesota and invited followers to move in with him and his wife Penny. 'Mostly the people who live in our house are ex-druggies, ex-alcoholics, ex-prostitutes,' Mrs Barthrop says - and in the documentary, many of them have the demeanour of people who are high on drugs during the preacher's sermons. In fact, however, the only times they take narcotics are when they snort imaginary cocaine or smoke invisible marijuana. Mr Barthrop has also replaced his former drug habit with frankincense and 'diamond oil', home-made and entirely legal concoctions which he believes help bring him closer to God. Snorting: Mr Barthrop now takes frankincense because of its bilbical associations . Smoking: One of his followers pretending to toke on a Lego figurine like a spliff . Gathering: Mr Barthrop with a number of his followers all pretending to drink and take drugs . The priest spreads his message by releasing several videos a week on YouTube, in which he rants at the camera while his followers cackle with laughter in the background. In the Vice documentary, he is shown comparing religion to narcotics, saying: 'If you have some really good drugs, you know you don't keep those to yourself, you gotta find people to do them with, and we've found the perfect drug - getting high on Jesus.' While Mr Barthrop's ministry was inspired by Mr Crowder, the two have grown apart following a disagreement about the difference in their preaching. Trip: The worshippers are pictured at a bowling alley where they acted as it they were intoxicated . Lounging around: Two of Mr Barthrop's giggling followers relaxing at his home . 'They teach weird stuff,' Mr Crowder said. 'Like you have sex with God, like you eat gold dust to make you glow like a lightbulb. 'I've just seen a lot of people get caught up in a lot of weird things, and they've lost their freedom.' However, Mr Barthrop says that his former mentor is simply envious of his success, and scared of losing his position as leader of the movement. And he insists he will not stop at YouTube videos and a modest house - in the future, he says, he wants to take over a mansion and own his own television channel.","Brandon Barthrop took drugs as a teenager but had a religious epiphany .

"Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by a police officer on Saturday night. The teen, who was about to start college, was unarmed . US Attorney General Eric Holder has asked for the Justice Department to arrange an autopsy on the body of Michael Brown by a federal medical examiner. Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said in a news release on Sunday that Holder asked for the additional autopsy because of the ""extraordinary circumstances involved in this case"" and at the request of Brown's family. The 18-year-old Brown was shot and killed by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer on Aug. 9. Brown was black and unarmed. Officer Darren Wilson is white. Fallon says the autopsy will take place as soon as possible. He also said the Justice Department will still take the state's autopsy into account during the investigation. Protests have been going on since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed Aug. 9 by a white Ferguson officer, Darren Wilson. The death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Missouri's governor to put the Highway Patrol in charge of security. Discussion: President Barack Obama talks with Attorney General Eric Holder to discuss the situation in Ferguson, Missouri . The Ferguson Police Department waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store before he was killed, though Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson did not know Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend. The US Department of Justice also has deepened its civil rights investigation of the shooting, as Johnson said Saturday that 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door in the neighborhood gathering information. Governor Jay Nixon, who declared a state of emergency in Ferguson on Saturday after protests turned violent the night before, said Sunday morning on ABC's 'This Week' that he was not aware the police were going to release the surveillance video. 'It's appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,' he said. In announcing the curfew, Nixon said that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully, the state would not allow looters to endanger the community. 'We must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching,' Nixon said during a news conference that was interrupted repeatedly by people objecting to the curfew and demanding Wilson be charged with murder. Making their point: Some demonstrators stood with their hands up early on Sunday morning, the emblematic pose used by many protesters to characterize the position witness have said Brown had assumed when he was fatally shot . Hands up: As midnight arrived a crowd were on the corner of Canfield Drive and West Florissant Avenue in the St Louis suburb in Missouri, shouting and screaming at the night despite calls for then to go home . A law enforcement officer watches as tear gas is fired to disperse a crowd protesting the shooting of Brown . On guard: Dozens of heavily armed officers with batons, shields, helmets, assembled in grid formation. Swat vans came down the hill with cops on the top with assault rifles . Johnson said earlier Saturday that police would not enforce the curfew with armored trucks and tear gas but would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to leave. Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. But as the curfew deadline arrived early Sunday, remaining protesters refused to leave the area as officers spoke through a loudspeaker: 'You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately.' As officers put on gas masks, a chant from the distant crowd emerged: 'We have the right to assemble peacefully.' A moment later, police began firing canisters into the crowd. Highway Patrol Spokesman Lt. John Hotz initially said police only used smoke, but later told The Associated Press they also used tear gas canisters. 'Obviously, we're trying to give them every opportunity to comply with the curfew,' Hotz said. Ferguson police officer: Darren Wilson, 28, seen in a photo released by Yahoo! News receiving a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February has been named as the police officer who shot Brown . Slain in broad daylight: This image provided by KMOV-TV shows investigators inspecting the body of Brown on August 9, where he was shot in Ferguson. Brown's death has ignited days of clashes with furious protesters . On Saturday, some residents said it appeared the violent acts were being committed by people from other suburbs or states. 'Who would burn down their own backyard?' asked Rebecca McCloud, a local who works with the Sonshine Baptist Church in St. Louis. 'These people aren't from here. They came to burn down our city and leave.' Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, is a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, Jackson has said. The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson's whereabouts, and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up.","US Attorney General Eric Holder on Sunday ordered the Justice Department to conduct an autopsy of Michael Brown .

"Isis terrorists have a new poster boy – a bearded Egyptian known as the ‘hipster jihadi’ who sports trendy curly hair and black-rimmed glasses. He’s been pictured on the back of a horse carrying a machine gun and waving a scimitar in the air – and standing in front of a dusty car holding the same weapon. On Twitter he’s posted gruesome pictures of decapitated heads in a basket and rants glorifying Isis and its murderous leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Scroll down for video . 'Hipster jihadi': Islam Yaken has become the new poster boy of terror group Isis . Fanatic: This picture of Yaken brandishing a scimitar on horseback appeared on Twitter . But a photograph of him showing off his six-pack suggests that he had a very different lifestyle until recently. He’s been identified as Islam Yaken, an Egyptian university law graduate brought up in a wealthy family in Cairo, according to the Telegraph. Yaken was educated at the well-regarded French Lycée in Heliopolis, a well-to-do area of Cairo, and at the distinguished Ain Shams University. He can speak English and French and used to seem more concerned with burning calories in the gym than a holy war, according to his social media postings. He was known as a ‘funny but respectful’ person - and supported the former president of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed Morsi - but now his former school-friends are understandably concerned. Showing off: This picture of Yaken appears to demonstrate that he used to have very different priorities . Aliya Mikkawi wrote on Twitter: ‘Islam Yaken's story is freaking scary. He used to be at school with me.’ Yaken is reportedly living in an apartment belonging to someone else in the Syrian city of Raqqa, an Isis stronghold, and wants his family to join them. He apparently told his mother not to worry about the owners returning because they are ‘dead and gone’. Some Twitter users find his story so remarkable that they’re questioning its authenticity. One wrote: ‘Are we sure this is not a hoax? That someone isn’t pulling our leg here?’ Extremists: Fighters from Isis marching in Raqqa, Syria, where Yaken is now holed up . Iraqi militants from Isis overran a cluster of predominantly Christian villages alongside the country's semi-autonomous Kurdish region today, sending tens of thousands of civilians and Kurdish fighters fleeing from the area, several priests in northern Iraq said. The capture of Qaraqoush, Iraq's biggest Christian village, and at least four other nearby hamlets, brings the Islamic State to the very edge of the Iraqi Kurdish territory and its regional capital, Irbil. The Islamic State has already seized large chunks of northern and western Iraq in a blitz offensive in June, including Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul. The onslaught has pushed Iraq into its worst crisis since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops.","A bearded Egyptian known as the 'hipster jihadi' has joined terror group Isis .

"For a motorcycle rider, it is the ultimate adrenaline rush - and for anyone else, the most terrifying (and dangerous) motorsport event in the world. This new video reveals the astonishing risks taken by competitors in the Isle of Man's famous annual TT road race. It shows a helmet eye view from racer Michael Dunlop as he negoaties the course known as the most dangerous in the world - and which has claimed 240 rider's lives since it began in 1907. Scroll down for video . The video reveals the astonishing angles riders see the course as they lay their bikes down to get around corners, scraping their knees as they go. The video shows the bike jumping high into the air on several occasions as the rider battles to keep control . Between 1907 and 2009 (at the end of 2009 TT races period) there have been 240 rider deaths during official practices or races on the Snaefell Mountain Course. The worst year for fatalities was 1970 when six riders lost their lives at the TT. Another racer died at the Manx Grand Prix later in the same year. The TT races are notorious because riders achieve high speeds on very narrow, twisting streets, roads and lanes flanked by stone walls and buildings, and often come within inches of spectators. This stunning video was released today as preparations begin for the 2014 event, set to take place between the 24th of May and the 6th of June. 'There is nothing on Earth quite like the Isle of Man TT Races,' organisers say. 'No other motorcycle race is held on such a challenging track as the 37-mile plus Mountain Course with its seemingly never-ending series of bends, bumps, jumps, stone walls, manhole covers and telegraph poles. The skill, bravery and concentration levels required are immense, with speeds approaching 200mph, and, while difficult to learn and even harder to come first, the rewards for winning on the world famous course are like no other.

"Photos from an unreleased and potentially massive collection of stolen celebrity nudes can be bought online for $350. More evidence is emerging that this summer's celebrity nude leaks were only a peek at how many photos and videos were compromised through security flaws in Apple's iCloud. Business Insider's James Cook found that the internet users eagerly trading in stolen celebrity nudes have moved on from forums like Reddit and AnonIB to a German site called Volafile and that sellers are offering entire unseen collections for hundreds. More victims: Sellers claiming to have more stolen photos from celebrities such as Daisy Lowe (left) and Annalynne McCord (right) have moved them online through encrypted email or file-sharing sites like Volafile . Market: Users on the 'realtime filesharing' site Volafile use the chat function to discuss the upload of stolen photos and videos and uploaders solicit donations in bitcoin . Timing: A scrolling list of files available to view in each room is refreshed whenever a new file is uploaded and shows the amount of time left before a file disappears from the server . A 'realtime filesharing' site with a chat function, Volafile allows users to post images and other files, some of it pornographic in nature, that disappear after a short period of time. That's where Cook found many photos were being traded between users, with leaks of celebrities like actresses Annalynne McCord and Abigail Spencer being shared, to the praise of other users. One account tried to take the moral high ground, asking that users should go donate to Unicef's campaign against Ebola if they appreciated his leak of a hacked video of actress Abigail Spencer. Dealer: Business Insider posed as a buyer and contacted Sets Ahoy through encrypted email, who offered sets of nudes for around $350 . Still unreleased: Sets Ahoy peddled photos that have not been released publicly on sites like AnonIB and Reddit . Other users in Volafile rooms made requests for underage photos of celebrities like U.S. Olympian McKayla Maroney, who would have been under 18 in many of the shared photos allegedly of her. Even Reddit, which was criticized for tolerating the hacked photos for a time in spite of otherwise strict anti-doxing policies, had cracked down on leaks like Maroney's. Nils Kuhnhenn, creator of Volafil, deleted the chatrooms after being contacted by Business Insider and rooted out rooms uploaders had planned to fall back on after the original ones were closed. He said he deletes rooms violating the site's terms of use as they are discovered. But outside of Volafile, bigger stashes of hacked photos that have not yet leaked are being sold by dealers in exchange for bitcoins. One dealer named Sets Ahoy, who sells collections of photos by the dozen, was contacted through his encrypted email address and offered to sell sets of celebrities such as British model Daisy Lowe. 'Today it's been 1 btc,' read the email sent to Business Insider, who posed as a buyer. 'I do offer discounts for multiple sets though.' The cryptocurrency is currently trading just under $350 for one bitcoin. Sets Ahoy verified his samples of the photos through a Dropbox link, then deleted them. It is not certain how the cloud-based file storage site will respond to the use of their site. What this does show is that, in spite of this summer's massive leak and subsequent responses from Apple and Google over cloud-computing's security flaws, the community sharing celebrity nudes was only temporarily disrupted. Altogether, dealers and other collectors may be holding onto thousands of photos of celebrities, and simply staying quiet. That's in addition to the unknown number of photos of non-celebrities whose photos hackers have quietly been stealing for years, as Wired pointed out.","Private dealers are offering photos that include celebrities such as British model Daisy Lowe over encrypted email exchanges in exchange for bitcoins .

"A 25-year-old writer who was dumped this week via text - after two only dates - has revealed how she sought to exact revenge by contacting the man's workplace and complaining that he'd sent her sexting messages using his company Blackberry. Not content with reporting him to his boss, Quin Woodward Pu also blogged about her experience – a decision that has backfired spectacularly judging from the amount of scorn she has received on countless social media forums since revealing her cruel act of revenge. Describing herself as 'The Taylor Swift of literature' and 'a straight-A Asian-American extrovert from Georgia with a penchant for vodka, designer shoes and older men,’ Washington D.C.-based Woodward Pu clearly isn’t lacking in confidence although she does lack some self-awareness. A recent blog post by Quin Woodward Pu has earned her a host of negative replies after she revealed her childish reaction to being dumped by a man she had only met twice . She's the editor-in-chief of Little Black Blog, a website filled with lots of words and pictures devoted to her favorite subject - Quin Woodward Pu. In a blog posted entitled ‘I’m 26 What’s a filter?’ posted on Tuesday she wrote of how two weeks ago she met a random man in a bar. ‘He was friendly enough, but annoyingly and sloppily drunk, which is why I offered my email address when he asked for my number. We emailed later that weekend, and I met up for a few drinks, which eventually turned to dinner, and then champagne. 'We had relatively good chemistry, but then, I kinda have chemistry with pretty much everyone, because I really like talking to people and winning over complete strangers,’ she wrote. Quin Woodward's pompous self-aggrandized claims to be 'a 25 year old with two published books and a condo' has won her few fans and a host of negative comments . The pair had a second date last weekend, which went so well that Woodward Pu decided to invite the man to her upcoming 26th birthday party, taking place this weekend, to which she has invited her closest 125 friends. ‘He wouldn’t be in town, so he scheduled a weekend in Virginia wine country the following weekend,’ she wrote. ‘It seemed a bit much, but I agreed to a singular day trip.’ But before things could get more serious, Woodward Pu received a text from her prospective boyfriend the next day in which he unceremoniously dumped her in a rather weaselly fashion. In his text, the man - whose name she doesn't disclose - gives her that most cliched of breakup lines that he isn’t ‘looking for a relationship’ and that he has ‘no doubt you’ll move on quickly as you are a funny, smart, cool girl!’ Woodward Pu writes of how her surprise quickly turned to fury on receiving the message. Woodward Pu's two books - 'A+' and 'Digfast' are in fact self-published tomes of her own autobiography which have received a host of negatives reviews on Amazon . ‘I was stunned into paralysis. I had no words – this never happens – and I just felt short of breath. 'There were many things that pissed me off, but I was so flustered I couldn’t even articulate them. Again, this is a serious problem for a writer and effusive communicator. ‘I was still so agitated 10 hours later that I had to leave opera rehearsal early. This is a serious no-no, given that opening night is Saturday at the Organization of American States. ‘Then I realized: I am on the eve of my 26th birthday. Why am I stewing instead of just expressing what I really feel? There is practically nothing to lose from just telling the truth.’ Next, Woodward Pu revealed how she decided to exact her childish revenge - by sending screen shots of sexting messages they had exchanged to his superiors. She justified her actions because he had sent the messages from his 'taxpayer-funded' work Blackberry. In her blog she claims her actions were a feminist act for ‘you, and your girlfriends, moms, grandmothers, daughters, etc’ because women should ‘never remain silent in the bombastic, outrageously chauvinistic face of an insecure man.’ Quin Woodward Pu is the editor-in-chief of Little Black Blog, a website filled with lot of words and pictures devoted to her favorite subject - herself . If Woodward Pu thought that revealing her over-the-top act of revenge was going to win her plaudits for being a 'strong, independent woman,' she had sorely misjudged her public. Instead of praise she has attracted a host of negative comments accusing her of being a vain, insecure narcissist. 'This woman is SHAMEFUL! The irony is this blog post was suppose to make her look like some kind of ""hero"" when really it makes her the villain in this situation. She needs to grow up. She should be thankful that this man was honest with her, and tried to move on in an adult manner. 'I don’t know why she’s even dating, as she’s clearly not mature enough to be in a relationship. This woman makes us all look bad,' wrote Quinisababy. Woodward Pu's pompous self-aggrandized claim to be ‘a 25 year old with two published books and a condo' has won her few fans and a whole host of enemies. Quin Woodward Pu's two volumes of self-published memoirs have been labeled 'narcissistic' and 'pretentious' One commenter, Michael, wrote: 'Despite her claim to feminist righteousness, I think she’s undermining the very cause she purports to support by confusing public vs private issues and using a movement to justify her poorly-formed emotional-coping skills.' Her two books - 'A+' and 'Digfast' - it turns out are self-published tomes of her own autobiography. Both are available via Amazon where they too have attracted a great deal of scorn. 'This girl has problems. She is narcissistic and pretentious,' wrote Mr Dude. 'The author is in live with herself, despite her complete lack of any real accomplishments (no, your trendy Sex and the City lifestyle doesn't count) or personal likeability,' wrote KTW. 'How narcissistic do you have to be to self-publish two memoirs by age 26 without having done anything of note,' wrote Why? It isn’t clear what has happened to her unnamed ex. The sexting messages are unlikely to cause him more than some embarrassment in front of his boss - or his boss might tell him he has had a lucky escape from Miss Woodward Pu.","Quin Woodward Pu, 25, was unceremoniously dumped via text this week by a man she had been on two dates with .

"Atlantic City's crumbling casino market disintegrated even further Saturday as the owners of the Trump Plaza casino said they expect to shut down in mid-September. Trump Entertainment Resorts told The Associated Press that no final decision has been made on the Boardwalk casino. But the company said it expects the casino to close its doors Sept. 16. Notices warning employees of the expected closing will go out to the casino's 1,000-plus employees Monday. Big loser: The Trump Plaza casino is the poorest performing casino in all of Atlantic City . If Trump Plaza closes, Atlantic City could lose a third of its casinos and a quarter of its casino workforce in less than nine months. The Atlantic Club closed in January, the Showboat is closing next month and Revel might do likewise if a buyer can't be found in bankruptcy court. The head of Atlantic City's main casino workers' union demanded state lawmakers help head off what he called a ""pending catastrophe"" that will affect the state's tourism industry and tax collections. Trump Entertainment Resorts said that its managers and board of directors 'have been reviewing alternatives for the property. Although this review has not been completed and no final decision has been made, the company expects that it will terminate the operations of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino on or shortly after September 16, 2014.' Double down: Trump Plaza made just $73 million from gamblers last year, the smallest amount of any of the 12 casinos in Atlantic City . A source with direct knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to speak to the media told the AP that the company has hired a search firm to solicit buyers for Trump Plaza, an effort that remains ongoing. So far, no buyer has emerged. The company did not indicate what might become of the building after it is closed. Bob McDevitt, president of local 54 of the Unite-HERE union, said 7,000 casino workers - or about one in four - have been warned their jobs could disappear within 60 days. 'While this is a personal tragedy for every family involved, it is also a crisis for the state,' he said. 'We expect Trenton to react with more than just sympathetic sound bites; we demand action equal to the magnitude of this pending catastrophe.' Trump Plaza, which cost $210 million to build, opened in May 1984 as one of Donald Trump's pet projects. The real estate mogul has since limited his dealings in Atlantic City to a 10 percent stake in Trump Entertainment Resorts. Denial: Trump says he has nothing to do with the failing casino and that he simply 'let them use my name' 'I let them use my name, but I have nothing to do with it,' Trump said on Saturday. 'Atlantic City has suffered for years. Many mistakes were made by government, tremendous mistakes, including no reinvestment in town; they would take casino revenue and put it in places that had nothing to do with Atlantic City. I got out seven years ago; my timing was tremendous.' New Jersey in recent years has required casino development taxes to be used only in Atlantic City. The news is the latest in a cascade of setbacks for Atlantic City's gambling market, which until just a few years ago was the second-largest in the nation after Nevada; Pennsylvania has now taken over that spot. Analysts have long said that the casino market here, and in the Northeastern United States, has been oversaturated, and that some casinos need to close to ensure the survival of others. On Jan. 1, Atlantic City had 12 casinos. By the end of September, it could have eight. Ghost town: By the end of September, the number of casinos in Atlantic City could go from 12 to eight as many consider closing . The Atlantic Club closure cost 1,600 workers their jobs. An additional 2,100 at Showboat will be unemployed as of Aug. 31, in addition to the 1,009 Trump Plaza workers on the payroll. Revel has 3,100 workers who could lose their jobs if the 2-year-old casino resort is not sold. Trump Entertainment Resorts has tried for years to sell Trump Plaza, the poorest performing casino in Atlantic City. A deal to sell it last year for $20 million to a California firm fell through. It won less than $73 million from gamblers in all of last year, ranking last out of the 12 casinos that operated then. So far this year it has taken in nearly $21 million, down almost 27 percent from the same period last year.","Of the 12 casinos in Atlantic City, Trump Plaza brings in the least amout of gambling revenue .

"Hillary Clinton gave a measured defense on Monday of the Obama administration's controversial decision to swap five Guantanamo Bay detainees for a US soldier held hostage in Afghanistan, noting that many of America's allies make similar deals. The former secretary of state was asked about the exchange of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl at an event in Denver. Clinton said she did not second-guess people who make such tough decisions, but said the American tradition of caring for its citizens and soldiers was a 'noble' one. Qualified defense: Hillary Clinton, offered a measured opinion on the Obama administration's decision to exchange Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl on Monday in Denver . She also noted that countries like Israel have made similar swaps, citing that country's decision to exchange more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for one of its soldiers in 2011. 'This young man, whatever the circumstances, was an American citizen - is an American citizen - was serving in our military,' Clinton said. 'The idea that you really care for your own citizens and particularly those in uniform, I think is a very noble one.' Several Republicans have hammered the Obama administration for the deal, saying it had capitulated to terrorists. Additionally, some critics have suggested that Bergdahl deserted his post in Afghanistan before being captured by the Taliban in 2009. Controversial exchange: Private First Class Bowe Bergdahl as a young private (left) and a Taliban hostage (right) Clinton said the most important thing will be to get as much information as possible from Bergdahl about his time in captivity, saying he could be a valuable intelligence asset and shed light on the Taliban's workings. She noted the Guantanamo detainees were supposed to be kept in the Gulf emirate of Qatar for a year. She added that she understood regrets about the deal but that the Obama administration feared Bergdahl wouldn't survive much longer. She described it as an example of the 'hard choices' in government that is also the title of her forthcoming book. President Barack Obama formally announced the release of Bowe Bergdahl on Saturday in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by Bergdahl's mother Jani Bergdahl, left, and father Bob Bergdahl, right. Obama said Saturday that making sure no man is left behind is 'who we are as Americans.' 'You don't want to see these five prisoners go back to combat. There's a lot that you don't want to have happen. On the other hand you also don't want an American citizen, if you can avoid it, especially a solider, to die in captivity,' Clinton said. 'I think we have a long way to go before we really know how this is going to play out.' Clinton appeared as part of a public speaking series called Unique Lives & Experiences.","Former secretary of state said that she was unwilling to second guess the Obama administration's decision .

"A family who moved to a picturesque cottage halfway up a Welsh mountain is receiving a steady stream of visitors - namely Led Zeppelin fans. Ecologist Scott Roe, 42, thought the tiny house would be an escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. But because Led Zeppelin used it as a country hideaway to write Stairway To Heaven, Scott's family get visited frequently by rock fans on a pilgrimage. Scroll down for video . Scott and Ruth Roe moved to Bron Yr Aur cottage with their daughter to get some peace and quiet. The house is where Led Zeppelin wrote their classic anthem Stairway To Heaven . The family are now often visited by rockers taking a pilgrimage to the property . One mystery rocker even stole the sign from outside the remote property where Robert Plant and Jimmy Page lived. Father-of-three Scott said: 'They come from all over the world. 'One guy walked all the way here from Germany, foraging berries and sleeping in churchyards as he went.' One rambler walked all the way there  from Germany, eating berries and sleeping in churchyards as he went . Stairway To Heaven was written by Zep frontman Robert Plant (centre) and guitarist Jimmy Page (right) and formed the centrepiece of their untitled fourth album, referred to as Led Zeppelin IV . Page and Plant wrote the song from a selection of tapes they recorded while staying at the cottage in 1970 . Scott lives with wife Ruth and their daughter at Bron-Yr-Aur, near Machynlleth, Mid Wales. He told us: 'We love our home and are very lucky to live here.' The property was bought by Ruth's father in 1970 shortly after the rockers moved out. Led Zeppelin wrote much of their third album at the house and it is immortalised in the song 'Bron-Y-Aur Stomp' - although the band accidently misspelled its name. One mystery Led Zeppelin fan even managed to sneak up and take the sign from outside their house . Genius: Since its release in 1971 it has consistently ranked among the best rock songs of all time in polls . While staying at Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant recorded parts of Stairway to Heaven on a cassette player after the intro came to Page in the middle of the night. They then took parts of the recording back to their fellow band mates who added the bassline and drumbeats. The track was released as part of the band's fourth untitled album, usually referred to as Led Zeppelin IV, and while it was the stand-out track, it took two or three years for it to reach anthemic status. Since then it has consistently ranked among the greatest rock song of all time in magazine polls, and in the US alone it is estimated it had been played 2,874,000 times on radio, enough to last for 44 years if run back-to-back. It is perhaps not surprising then that Jimmy Page once called an Oregon radio station during a charity drive and offered to donate $10,000 if they promised never to play the track again, which the station agreed to. In 1982 the song fell foul of the backward masking 'scandal' that affected many great rock songs of the time, as American TV stations alleged the song contained hidden satanic messages that could only be heard if it was played backwards. Among the messages said to be hidden in Stairway To Heaven were 'Here's to my sweet Satan' and 'I sing because I live with Satan', which could allegedly be heard if the lyrics 'If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now...' were reversed.","Scott and Ruth Roe family moved to Bron-Yr-Aur cottage to escape city life .

"A 20-year-old footballer for Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala has been shot dead near his home in Russia's volatile North Caucasus. Gasan Magomedov was driving into his home village Saturday night when his car was sprayed with machine-gun fire and he died from his wounds while being transported to hospital, Anzhi said in a statement. No arrests have been made and the motive is unclear, the club said. Magomedov was a regular in midfield for Anzhi's youth and reserve teams and the club expressed 'the deepest condolences' on his death. Gasan Magomedov, who played for Anzhi, was shot while driving into his village on Saturday night . The club said the player 'could not have provoked anything like this in any way' after the shooting . 'One thing can be said with confidence - Magomedov could not have provoked anything like this in any way,' the club said. The Russian region of Dagestan, where the attack took place and where Anzhi is based, has a long-running Islamist insurgency. Gun battles between rebels and Russian security forces are not uncommon. Anzhi challenged for the Russian Premier League title in recent years, but was relegated to the second tier last season. For several years, it had a policy of basing star players, including striker Samuel Eto'o, in Moscow to avoid Dagestan's security risks. In the past the club encouraged big-money stars like Willian (left) and Samuel Eto'o (right) to live in Moscow .","Gasan Magomedov was a regular for club's youth and reserve teams .

"When most people reach the ripe old age of 85 they are enjoying a sedate retirement. But burleque dancer Tempest Storm has no intention of hanging up her nipple tassles for the quiet life.

"Little comes close to the bliss of glowing tanned and healthily on an almost-clear fine sand beach, palm trees cocooning you in 32-degree heat, a light breeze, a blended iced coffee by your side and a tropical sea inches from your sun lounger. It's the ultimate image of holiday - that precious two weeks away from your desk, for which you save up all year. But what if instead of simply letting all your worries go on a beach, you could take your break away from everyday life one step further, by not only removing your city suit, but taking off your clothes altogether. This is what sets the Riviera Maya based Karisma resorts apart from other similar destinations. Situated equal distance from Tulum and Playa del Carmen on Mexico's Quintana Roo coast, El Dorado Seaside Suites and Hidden Beach Resort adjoin - but while one requires clothing, the other is nudist. A large pool with a bar in the middle of Hidden Beach is the ideal place to sip cocktails and chat ... in the nude . The beach view from El Dorado Seaside Suites is blissful - and Hidden Beach guests are welcome . And for a daily rate curious guests from El Dorado can dip their toes into its sister resort's clothing optional policy. At El Dorado, up to 1,000 guests stay at any one time and have their pick of several fine international retaurants - including a standout Asian place that does great sushi. It's a grand building with daily beach side activities and a breathtaking spa (more of that later). Next door . is another couples resort that those in the know call the 'happy place'. They've got just 42 rooms, one pool, pool bar and restaurant. Guests . here can stay as clothed or as naked as they like. Mainly, of course, . they're naked. They have a strictly no swingers policy. Both resorts are called 'Gourmet Inclusive', . rather than all-inclusive - as they provide something more than a five-star package holiday. The menu is varied and exceptional. Our room was huge, which is standard, and had a flat screen TV, jacuzzi bathroom and bed on the balcony . I was . initially invited to Hidden Beach to sample their latest evening . entertainment schedule of chocolate and UV body painting parties, . courtesy of international party firm Social Exposure. When I found out the resort itself was nudist, I was kind of excited to try it out. What could possibly go wrong? And in fact I envisioned the experience of removing clothes as one which accentuates the feeling of having an ultimate break from reality. It's well known that nudist resorts are generally quite expensive, and frequented by high-powered professionals who wear a uniform of suits and spend their lives presenting an image. So they come here to let that all go - quite literally. But of course, it was quite the unnerving proposal; staying somewhere so - liberated - when I'd never tried nudism before. So I organised to stay at El Dorado and visit Hidden Beach for a full day, and also for the two themed painting parties. A room service breakfast of coconut cream jombo oat porridge, vegetable omlette, fruit plates and coffee . After a breakfast of salmon and eggs by the sand at El Dorado my nervous friend . and I, wearing bikinis and towels, walked all of 10 steps to Hidden . Beach next door. We . observed the private and very exclusive scene: a large pool with a bar . in the middle with volleyball set up next to it; six couples playing a . game, a couple more propped up sipping cocktails, cheering on their . friends and chatting to staff. Everyone . at Hidden Beach really get along with each other; it's like a holiday for a bunch of . extended friends with the only twist being that everyone's naked. It was quite surreal. Most . people were a couple decades older than my friend and I, so after all of . about two minutes sitting on the sun loungers we felt confident enough to whip off our bikini . tops and bottoms. We had a feeling that we might, in a strange way, feel more . uncomfortable actually wearing clothes. Soon . we were in that pool playing game after game of volleyball, having a . blast and making real friends. And we'd hardly said a word to any of our . fellow guests back at El Dorado. Guests . from the adjoining hotel can sample the Hidden Beach experience . themselves if they wish for £89 (€100) a day; and if they only wanted to . attend the evening parties they can do so for the same (unless you're staying at either resort, you can't attend). The chocolate body painting party started out with pretty designs - before it turned into a food fight . The body painting party catering included a table of chocolate-dipped fruit and marshmallows on sticks . Hidden Beach guests can go back and forth between both resorts as they please, and they tend to do so especially for the restaurants. At the UV party, as well as your usual party equation of band, free bar, black light and dancefloor, a UV spray paint artist came to decorate . everyone's bodies with beautiful designs; namely Japanese flowers on the . women and wild animals on the men. The chocolate body painting party involved a giant table of chocolate desserts, a bucket of chocolate sauce with paint brushes, squirty cream and a live band. When you're already naked you may as well get creative. My friend and I began painting sugar skulls and floral scenes on each other's backs, but a couple hours later squirty cream was getting sprayed around and it escalated into a full blown food fight. It was great, but it was definitely time to shower. Also, by this point we'd eaten too much cake. Ancient . Mexicans were of course one of the first people to discover chocolate, . drinking cacao beverages as far back as 1900 BC. It felt fun and crazy . but kind of authentic to the location. After that initiation, I was eager for the full alternative holiday experience so made sure to book in for a Temazcal ritual with the on-site spa's very own shaman. The shaman told us to choose a musical instrument at the start of the ritual - before getting in the temazcal . The experience involves chants, sweat, invocation, and the steam from herbs said to purify and relax you . The holistic sauna ritual known as a 'house of steam' is set in a cave-like structure and is certainly the hottest sauna I've ever been in. The ancient Aztec ritual is said to feel like returning to the mother's womb; the one who cures physical and spiritual ills by separating us from the outside world so we can reconnect with our inner selves. The experience involves chants, sweat, invocation, and steam from herbs. It's said to purify and relax the mind and body. What happens inside is somewhat secret - which is challenging mentally as well as physically. It's certainly not your usual relaxing massage, but as far as spa experiences go, it's one of the most rewarding that I've tried. We spent an hour debriefing and talking deeply with the young shaman afterwards. A moment of calm by the El Castillo, one of the Seven Wonders of the World . Beautiful clothes stalls by Chichen Itza (l) and, of course, colourful ceramic sugar skulls (r) On our final day we embarked on a full day excursion to great Mayan ruin Chichen Itza - the archeological site that's home to one of the seven Wonders of the World, El Castillo. Before our elaborate guided tour we went for a swim in a natural water pool in a stalactite-filled cave known as a cenote. Afterwards we stopped to visit Spanish colonial city Valladolid, Yucatan, for a stroll around the main square. The El Castillo Mayan pyramid is famous for sculptures of plumed serpents running down its sides. During the spring and autumn equinoxes, the late afternoon sun casts a series of triangular shadows against the northwest balustrade, creating the illusion of a snake crawling down. After witnessing this wonder and hearing of its ancient greatness, indulging in decadent freedom at naked chocolate body painting and going through a moral lesson in the temazcal, I left Riviera Maya feeling refreshed, enlightened - and definitely braver.

"It is a dilemma faced by anyone invited to meet the Queen: what exactly does one wear? This sniper serving with the Household Cavalry Regiment opted for his work outfit... leaving the Queen looking more than a little perplexed.

"For the barbecue aficionado, cooking the perfect burger is an art form. But as grills across the country are sparked into action this weekend, a leading dietitian has a word of warning for those brandishing the tongs. Lurking inside your 'perfectly cooked' burger could be a vicious bacteria, waiting to attack your insides. A leading dietitian has warned of the dangers of under-cooking burgers, as minced beef harbours E. coli bacteria, among the main causes of food poisoning. Dr Cara Rosenbloom, writer of the Words To Eat By blog, said: It's vital that both the outside and the inside are cooked to a temperature of 71°C' While the dangers of under-cooking chicken are widely known, few are aware that beef too, must be cooked to a set temperature. Dietitian Cara Rosenbloom, writer of the Words To Eat By blog, said minced beef is one of the main carriers of E. coli, a harmful bacteria among the most common causes of food poisoning. But, she said, spotting a burger riddled with the bacteria is difficult as the meat will smell and look normal. The food safety expert, trained in microbiology, added: 'While the surface of any meat can technically harbour E. coli, it is killed when you cook food at a high temperature. 'If E. coli is on the surface of a steak, it is killed by the grill, even if the inside of the meat stays pink. 'However, burgers made from ground . beef are different. Bacteria can be spread during grinding, so E.coli . can be anywhere on the surface or the inside of the burger. 'It's vital that both the outside and the inside are cooked to a temperature of 71°C (160°F).' Around 90,000 cases of food poisoning are recorded each year in England and Wales. Dr Rosenbloom said while E.coli on the surface of steaks are destroyed by the high temperature of the grill, the bacteria can coat mince during the grinding process, meaning burgers must reach 71C inside and out to be certain the bug has been destroyed . Start with clean hands, and wash . often as you prepare food.  This is especially vital when your . ingredients include raw meat, chicken and eggs. Understand marinade etiquette. Step one: marinate food in the fridge. Step two: throw out marinade that was used on raw meat or poultry – do . not use it on cooked food. If the raw meat bathed in it, consider that . the bacteria from the meat is now in the marinade. Toss it out and start . fresh. When taking . foods off the grill, do not put cooked food items back on the same plate . that held raw food, unless it has been washed with hot water and soap . first. Invest in a digital food thermometer and measure the internal temperatures: . However, . the true figure is thought to be closer to one million, with only a . minority of victims going to see the GP to give a sample and . subsequently end up logged in the official statistics. E. coli is among the most common causes of food posioning, usually caught from undercooked beef including mince and burgers. While the bacteria can cause a person to suffer cramps and bloody diarrhoea, it can be even more dangerous for children. Those under the age of five can develop a complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome, in which the red blood cells are destroyed and the kidneys fail. Past studies have found food poisoning can lead to lifelong consequences. Research has shown those caught up in food poisioning outbreaks are more likely to develop a host of long-term illnesses, including diabetes, arthritis, kidney failure, high blood pressure and even heart attacks and strokes. Some, such as kidney damage, are thought to be caused by powerful poisons released by bugs. Experts have advised that people who have survived severe food poisoning, such as that caused by the E. coli 0157 strain, undergo regular blood pressure and kidney checks.","Dr Cara Rosenbloom has warned of the dangers of eating undercooked beef .

"A Canadian couple endured a roller-coaster ride of emotions when a lottery ticket worth $50 million went missing only to be found and returned by someone at their church. Hakeem Nosiru won the January 17 Lotto Max draw and was one day away from claiming the money when the signed ticket, which he taped to the inside his wife's purse for safekeeping, was missing after they attended church.

"The mother of an American journalist who was released Sunday after two years in captivity said she is 'so relieved' to have her son on his way home, though she mourned the brutal killing of his fellow reporter James Foley. Peter Theo Curtis was handed over to UN representatives, just days after Foley was beheaded by ISIS. Curtis is now safely outside Syria, U.S. government officials confirmed. The United Nations said it helped with the handover to U.N. peacekeepers in a village in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights and that Curtis was released to American authorities after a medical checkup. 'My heart is full at the extraordinary, dedicated, incredible people, too many to name individually, who have become my friends and have tirelessly helped us over these many months,' said Nancy Curtis. 'Please know that we will be eternally grateful.' Curtis, 45, was abducted in Antakya, Turkey, in October 2012 from where he planned to enter Syria to teach English, according to Al Jazeera. He was held by the Nusra Front, the Qaeda affiliate in Syria, which has broken with the more radical ISIS. Scroll down for videos . Free: Peter Theo Curtis, pictured, was handed over to UN representatives on Sunday, just days after another U.S. reporter, James Foley, was beheaded by the Islamic State group. 'We are so relieved that Theo is healthy and safe and that he is finally headed home after his ordeal, but we are also deeply saddened by the terrible, unjustified killing last week of his fellow journalist, Jim Foley, at the hands of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, ISIS,' Mrs Curtis said. She said in the statement that she had gotten to know the Foley family over the months their sons had been captive. 'I have seen Diane Foley's bravery and her heroic efforts firsthand, efforts that helped rally the spirits of the families of all the journalists and others being held captive,' she said. 'We appeal to the captors of the remaining hostages to release them in the same humanitarian spirit that prompted Theo's release. The release came on the same day as a memorial for Foley was held in New Hampshire. U.S. officials declined to discuss details of the negotiations for the release of Curtis. It was not known what prompted Curtis' release, though his mother insisted no money changed hands, as some have speculated. 'While the family is not privy to the exact terms that were negotiated, we were repeatedly told by representatives of the Qatari government that they were mediating for Theo's release on a humanitarian basis without the payment of money,' she said. 'My entire focus right now is on helping the other families of those still being held in Syria, and on taking care of my son.' Footage released on June 30 shows a relatively healthy-looking albeit disheveled Curtis, who also goes by the name Theo Padnos. In the video obtained by Al Jazeera, Curtis read from a prepared script stating his name and profession, saying he was a journalist from Boston, Massachusetts. He said he had been well treated and 'had everything' he needed. 'Everything has been perfect, food, clothing, even friends now,' he said on the tape, according to the broadcaster. That account sits in stark contrast to the one told by his cellmate during some of his time in captivity. According to the New York Times, American photojournalist Matthew Schrier, who escaped in July 2013 after being held for seven months, described being tortured and starved by his masked captors. So desperate, Schrier eventually managed to crawl out of a hole in the wall he created by standing on Curtis' back and unraveling wires in a small opening. Safe now: Curtis, pictured prior to his kidnapping, is safely outside of Syria now with a UN representative . Missing: Curtis reportedly went missing in Antakya, Turkey, as he was traveling to Syria in 2012 . However, the heavier-set Curtis became stuck and chose to return to the cell where he remained for another 13 months. The pair were held in the rebel-held portion of Aleppo. U.S. officials declined to discuss details of the negotiations for the release of Curtis. It was not known what prompted Curtis' release. A cousin of Curtis', Viva Hardigg, declined to provide details on the circumstances of his release, but said he seems to be in good health. Hardigg told The Associated Press: 'We are deeply relieved and grateful for his return and the many people who have helped us secure his freedom. At the same time, we are thinking constantly of the other hostages who are still held and those working to help them be freed. We want to do everything we can to support their efforts.' Secretary of State John Kerry dubbed Curtis' safe release a victory for the U.S. and the journalist's family. In a statement Sunday, he said: 'Particularly after a week marked by unspeakable tragedy, we are all relieved and grateful knowing that Theo Curtis is coming home after so much time held in the clutches of Jabhat Al-Nusrah. 'For two years, this young American has been separated from his family. Finally he is returning home. Theo's mother, whom we've known from Massachusetts and with whom we've worked during this horrific period, simply refused to give up and has worked indefatigably to keep hope alive that this day could be a reality. Cellmates: Curtis, left, was held in a cell with American photojournalist Michael Schrier, right, who escaped in 2013 . Before: Curtis was originally from Boston but had lived abroad for many years researching the Muslim faith . Author: Curtis, right,who also goes by the name Theo Padnos, wrote numerous books about Islam . 'Over these last two years, the United States reached out to more than two dozen countries asking for urgent help from anyone who might have tools, influence, or leverage to help secure Theo's release and the release of any Americans held hostage in Syria. 'Every waking hour, our thoughts and our faith remain with the Americans still held hostage and with their families, and we continue to use every diplomatic, intelligence, and military tool at our disposal to find them and bring our fellow citizens home.' National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice said in a statement that Curtis is now safe outside Syria and soon will be reunited with his family. 'For two years, we have kept Peter Theo Curtis, a U.S. citizen held hostage in Syria, in our thoughts and prayers. Today, we join his family and loved ones in welcoming his freedom,' she said. Rice said the government had not forgotten the other Americans still held. There are believed to be four. '...We hold in our thoughts and prayers the Americans who remain in captivity in Syria,' she said. 'Notwithstanding today's welcome news, the events of the past week shocked the conscience of the world. As President Obama said, we have and will continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to see that the remaining American hostages are freed.' James Foley was beheaded by Islamic State militants who released a video last week blaming his death on U.S. airstrikes against their fighters in Iraq. Foley's captors had demanded $132.5 million from his parents and political concessions from Washington. Neither obliged, authorities say. For al-Qaida and some other militant bands, ransoms paid to free kidnapped Europeans over the past decade have surpassed donations from private supporters as a source of funding, according to the United States and Britain. The British government, like the U.S., adheres to a longstanding policy against paying ransoms to extremists. A senior Obama administration official said last week the Islamic State had made a 'range of requests' from the U.S. for Foley's release, including changes in American policy and posture in the Mideast. Mrs Curtis said her son went to Syria because he wanted to help the people there. 'Theo has a deep concern and regard for the people of Syria, which is why he returned during the war,' she said. 'He wanted to help others and to give meaning and to bear witness to their struggles.' She added: 'I am very fortunate that I do not have to tell his whole story. He eventually will be able to do so himself.' Curtis was born Peter Theophilus Eaton Padnos in Atlanta, Georgia, where his father, Michael Padnos, who is now a writer living in Paris, was working as a lawyer. He graduated from Middlebury College in Vermont, has a Ph.D. in comparative literature from the University of Massachusetts and is fluent in French and Arabic, his family said. He also speaks German and Russian. He first became interested in writing about disaffected youth while working as a teacher in the Vermont prison system, resulting in his first book, 'My Life Has Stood a Loaded Gun.' According to the family statement, while working as a journalist in Yemen, Curtis became interested in the stories of the many disaffected young men from the West coming to study Islam and he eventually wrote about them in his book, 'Undercover Muslim,' published in the United Kingdom. He changed his legal name to Peter Theo Curtis after publication of that book to make it easier to travel in the Arab world, although he continued to work as a journalist, writing under the name Theo Padnos. Curtis' family said he grew to love Syria and its people a decade ago while studying Arabic and Russian in Damascus.","Peter Theo Curtis was handed over to UN representatives on Sunday .

"The meteorite that crashed on Russia was hit by an unidentified flying object causing it to explode and shatter over the Urals, it has been claimed. The bizarre theory is based on analysis of blurry footage of the space rock as it streaked across morning sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. U.F.O enthusiasts insist a small 'object' can be seen colliding with the meteorite on its trajectory through the atmosphere, despite the fact there were no reports of Russia launching missiles to down the celestial intruder, they claim. Scroll down for video . E.T. to the rescue? A new picture showing the Russian meteorite and what is claimed to be a U.F.O (ringed) The watchers have seized on the unexplained images and an online debate is now underway in Russia with claims that 'we were saved by a UFO', reported the Siberian Times. The meteorite exploded in the atmosphere on 15 February with a force as great as 30 Hiroshima nuclear bombs, causing extensive damage in Chelyabinsk and injuring around 1,200 people, many from shattered glass. Alien enthusiasts have have seized on the unexplained images as evidence that 'we were saved by a UFO' Estimated by Nasa to have been 55ft-wide and with a weight of some 10,000 tons, the meteor is thought to have exploded above the Ural mountains with a force equivalent to about 500kilotons. Nuclear installations in the Urals remained undamaged by the fallout. 'At first, we also believed that the Chelyabinsk meteorite was just an ordinary meteorite, a cosmic body,' said Alexander Komanev, coordinator for the Russian UFO community in Yekaterinburg. But on at least three films of the space rock 'you can see how an object catches the meteorite', he said. This minuscule oblong-shaped object ""flies into it - and the meteorite explodes and falls'. He stressed: 'Such a number of videos, made from different angles, leads us to believe that something has blown up the meteorite...' He claimed that in the weeks before the meteorite, there was an upsurge in UFO sightings in the Urals, followed by none at all since the incident.

"The head of a mighty Tijuana drug cartel has been arrested at a restaurant while watching Mexico's soccer team playing in the World Cup. Fernando Sanchez Arellano, 42, who flooded the U.S. with cocaine and heroin for more than a decade, was detained in the border city of Tijuana after soldiers raided the premises in the middle of the game on Monday. According to federal officials, Sanchez Arellano, known as 'The Engineer', had $100,000 in cash on him when he was taken away . Scroll down for video . Captured: Fernando Sanchez Arellano, 42, known as 'The Engineer', was detained in the border city of Tijuana after soldiers raided the premises in the middle of Mexico's final group game . His huge drug operation, which controlled the flow of drugs across the US-Mexico border from Tijuana, inspired the Hollywood blockbuster, Traffic, starring Catherine Zeta Jones and Benecio Del Torro. Journalists were shown photographs of . Sanchez Arellano in a green soccer jersey and with his cheeks painted . with green, white and red, the colors of the Mexican flag. He couldn't celebrate Mexico's 3 -1 victory over Croatia because he was . arrested by soldiers before the game ended. Founded in the 1980s by Arellano's . uncle, Benjamin Arellano Felix, the organisation viturally conrtolled Mexico to US drug-trafficking channels in the 1990s. He inherited leadership of the cartel from his other . uncle, Javier Arellano Felix, who was arrested by the U.S. Coast Guard . off Mexico's Baja California in 2006. He was later sentenced to 40 years in federal prison. Two years after his uncle was captured a renegade lieutenant, Teodoro Garcia Simental, made a power . play and set up his own operation. It prompted a bloodbath that turned Tijuana into one of Mexico's . most violent cities, plagued by daytime shootouts, beheadings and . mutilated corpses hanging from freeway bridges. Flag: Images of Sanchez Arellano wearing Mexico's colours were shown to the media after his capture . Sanchez Arellano was badly weakened after his rival was arrested in 2010, which created an opening for the Sinaloa cartel to quietly gain control of Tijuana's underworld and its coveted smuggling corridor to San Diego. The Sinaloa cartel has made its mark in the area with cross-border drug tunnels, large-scale smuggling of methamphetamine at San Diego border crossings and marijuana-laden boats that motor up the Pacific coast to California. In 2013, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration included Sanchez Arellano on a poster of the six most influential drug traffickers in that region but U.S. authorities were more concerned about rising Sinaloa cartel lieutenants. Gary Hill, an assistant DEA special agent in charge in San Diego, said in an interview at the time that Sanchez Arellano was 'almost like a ghost.' Transformations: A collection of images released by Mexico's Attorney General show the cartel leader's different appearances during his career . 'As we see it, the Sinaloa cartel has the upper hand,' Hill said. Mexican authorities have tried several times to grab drug traffickers when they had their guard down while attending parties but it hasn't always worked. In 2009, federal forces raided a party in the central state of Morelos attended by drug cartel leader Arturo Beltran Leyva, but he escaped. Marines cornered him days later at an apartment building in Cuernavaca, where he died in an hours-long shootout. Rival drug traffickers also have taken advantage of parties to go after enemies. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix, the eldest brother of the Tijuana clan, was killed last October by a gunman dressed as a clown at a party in the resort city of Los Cabos.

"A home owned by talk show host Conan O'Brien and used by his parents has been removed from a Rhode Island auction after he paid some back taxes on the property. Town officials told The Westerly Sun that Mr O'Brien, who has an estimated net worth of about $75 million,  paid his $8,000 bill on Friday morning. The property near the Westerly shore is valued at about $723,000. It was among several the town planned to auction on Tuesday to settle delinquent tax bills. Conan O'Brien on Friday paid $8,000 in back taxes on this Rhode Island house, saving it from being sold off at auction . 'As soon as I was made aware that the tax bill on my parents' house was being mailed to the wrong address, I paid the bill immediately,' Mr O'Brien said in a statement. 'The problem has been corrected. I am grateful to the reporter at the Westerly Sun who spotted this error and notified me.' Mr O'Brien publicist Drew Shane earlier had issued a statement saying the host had been unaware he owed back taxes. He blamed the problem on a clerical error that prevented the bill from reaching Mr O'Brien's accountant in Los Angeles. Property records show the house, located just across the street from a marina and boat yard, under the name of Mr O'Brien's parents, Thomas and Ruth O'Brien. The median income in the area is $127,000 and median home value $928,000. The 51-year-old comedian, who was born Conan Christopher O'Brien, grew up in neighboring Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard, where his father is a professor at the medical school. He has written for Saturday Night Live and the Simpsons and hosted Late Night with Conan O'Brien on NBC for 16 years. He briefly took over for Jay Leno on the Tonight Show but a dispute with NBC led to his departure in 2010. He switched networks to TBS and has been hosting Conan since then.

"The three-year-old boy who recently heard for the first time in his life has already started making sounds and loves nothing more than listening to music, it was revealed today. Grayson Clamp made headlines across the world this week when a video showing his reaction after he heard his father's voice for the first time was released. This came after he received a breakthrough auditory brain stem implant when a normal cochlear implant failed. His parents Nicole and Len said today that in the few weeks since the device was implanted, Grayson has started making sounds for the first time in his life. Scroll down for video . Progress: Nicole and Len Clamp on CNN's New Day with their son Grayson who heard for the first time a few weeks ago after a breakthrough medical trial . Higher power: The Clamps said they believe the whole thing was part of God's plan for them and for Grayson . Lively: As Grayson ran around the New Day newsroom reaching for everything, his parents revealed he has started making noises for the first time ever . Appearing on CNN's New Day, Len said: . 'It has been several weeks since the implant was activated and already . we have seen a lot of signs of progress. 'He needs to experience as much . sounds as possible to get used to them and associate them with an . object,' adding that the three-year-old loves listening to all types of . music. Nicole spoke of her joy at watching her son experience sound for the first time. What's all that noise? 3-year-old Grayson Clamp hears for the first time . Clamp's face 'lit up' the first time he could hear his father . 'It was a huge sense of relief for me, just overwhelming. Seeing it work was the culmination of a long journey.' Len added: 'It was validation of the . plan that God set out for our lives and for Grayson's life. We got an . overwhelming sense that God was with us. Grayson Clamp's parents tried . everything to help their deaf three-year-old son hear throughout his . short life before they turned to the untested method that had never been . used on a child in the U.S. before. After the chip was implanted in his . brain, Grayson - who was adopted by the Clamps as a newborn after he was . placed in foster care - could hear for the first time in his life. Medical breakthrough: Clamp was the first child in the Unites States to receive an auditory brain stem implant . Surgery: To implant the device that now allows him to hear, Clamp had to undergo brain surgery . 'We don't know exactly what it's like . for him,' Nicole Clamp told WBTV. 'We don't know exactly what he hears. His brain is still . trying organize itself to use sound.' Grayson is missing the cochlear nerves in his ears that allow humans to process the sounds that we hear. After the cochlear implant failed, . the Clamps decided to participate in a research trial at UNC Hospitals . in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where doctors were researching the use . of the implant on children. Auditory brain stem implants have been . used on adults in the U.S. since 1979. But researchers have never . before tested the device on children - although, it is approved for use . on children in Europe. The . procedure requires doctors to implant a microchip into a patient's . brain. The microchip then helps him recognize and process sound. The technology is similar to that of a cochlear implant - using electrical stimulation - the brain stem implant uses electrical impulses to stimulate the brain, rather than the cochlea. To date, roughly 1,000 people have undergone the procedure, with varying degrees of success - most recipients of the implant only have an awareness of sound. It's described as being able to hear the beat, but not the melody. For Grayson, the device seems to be working - his parents say his face lit up when he heard his father's voice for the first time about three weeks ago. 'It's been phenomenal for us,' Len Clamp says.

"A Second World War RAF hero who was awarded a medal for his skill and bravery may be laid to rest at a funeral with no mourners. Sidney Marshall, 90, passed away at his home in Lythan St Annes two weeks ago and had no children with his late wife Elizabeth, who died 18 months previously. Marshall, a mid-upper gunner, was awarded . the Distinguished Flying Medal for shooting down five Luftwaffe enemy . fighters when he was attacked while on a mission over Bergan. Sidney Marshall (pictured with wife Elizabeth who died 18 months before him) passed away at his home aged 90 and may now be buried at a funeral with no mourners as he did not have children . As a mid-gunner for the RAF he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal for shooting down German fighters. He also piloted a Lancaster bomber and was instrumental in the raid that sunk the Tirpitz . The veteran was also instrumental in the attack which sank The Tirpitz, a 42,900 ton Bismarck-class battleship built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, on November 12, 1944. He completed a remarkable 28 sorties piloting a Lancaster Bomber in the RAF's 9th Squadron. After the war he became a warrant officer and settled down with his wife in Lytham St Annes in Lancashire. Eddy Jacobs, of Roland Whitehead and Daughter Funeral Directors in Blackpool, has pleaded for mourners to attend Mr Marshall's funeral service on July 4. Mr Jacobs said: 'We've got so much to be thankful for to guys like these. 'I remember hiding under the kitchen table with my mother and at the same time he was probably flying off to fight the Germans. Undertaker Eddy Jacobs is now appealing for people to come forward to attend Mr Marshall's funeral . 'It's amazing really. I first met him 18 months ago when his wife died and he was absolutely devastated. 'He was a very unassuming sort of man, so when I heard the stories about his time during the war I couldn't believe it. These guys were so brave.' Mr Marshall has eight siblings but, apart from one brother, they are all too elderly to attend the service. Mr Jacobs added: 'He's got no-one to fight his corner really. He was quite a private person.' The Tirpitz was one of only two Bismark-class Nazi battleships. It had double armour plating, eight 15inch guns and carried nearly 2,000 officers and crew . The Tirpitz was one of only two Bismark-class battleships built for the Nazi Kreigsmarine - or navy - during the Second World War. The vast vessel weighed 42,900 tons, was double-plated with armour, carried nearly 2,000 officers and crew and was heavily armed with eight 15-inch cannons, flak guns and machine guns. It spent most of the war in Norwegian waters, harrying shipping convoys on their way to Russia and forcing the Allies to station a large naval force there to defend against it. The British Navy dared not risk a sea attack on the Tirpitz, as it was so heavily armed, so instead focused on destroying it from the air. Bombing raids while it was being built in 1941 failed to destroy it, and early attacks after it was completed were largely unsuccessful due to the thickness of its armour plating. It wasn't until 1944 that the RAF managed to cripple the craft after inventor Sir Barnes Wallis - who also designed the bouncing bomb - created the 12,030lb Tallboy, capable of penetrating the ship's defences. On September 15, 1944, 27 Lancaster bombers from RAF 9th and 617th squadrons took off from a base in Russia to attack the Tirpitz at anchor in Kaa Fjord in Northern Norway. One Tallboy found its target in the Tirpitz's forecastle, exploding deep within the battleship. The explosion was so powerful it knocked out the ship's engines, but the vessel failed to sink. Instead it was moved to southern Norway where it was stationed as a semi-static heavy artillery battery after Nazi high command decided they couldn't restore it to full strength. Another raid on October 29th failed as cloud blew over the ship just as the bombers were approaching, blocking it from view, meaning all the bombs missed. The RAF eventually sunk the Tirpitz on November 12 after hitting it with two Tallboys - huge 12,030lb bombs made specially for the mission by the same man who designed the bouncing bomb . The Tirpitz was finally sunk on November 12 when bombers from 9th and 617th squadron attacked it again, flying in low so as not to appear on radar. Despite warnings being sent from the ship to a nearby airfield, not a single German fighter took off to attack the bombers when they were finally spotted. The ship's flak guns could only do so much to defend her, and two Tallboys hit the deck, resulting in a huge explosion which caused the ship to list. Eventually ammunition stored below deck also exploded, causing the ship to turn to port and capsize. Within 10 minutes the vessel was completely upside down. The attack killed roughly 1,000 of her crew, but thanks to the inaction of German pilots the RAF lost none of its bombers which all returned safely to base - including the one carrying Sidney Marshall.","Sidney Marshall was an RAF gunner and pilot with during Second World War .

"A Florida mother made the toughest decision a parent can make Friday when she turned her son into police for murdering his girlfriend. Shortly after Khambrel Hadley, 21, confessed to murdering girlfriend, Alyssa Oakes, 19, and told her where he dumped the body, his mother called 911 to report the crime. The alleged murderer was arrested later that afternoon, according to reports. The doomed couple had moved into a Delano, FL., apartment just two months ago. Accused murderer: Khambrel Hadley allegedly confessed to murdering girlfriend Alyssa Oakes and dumping her body in a wooded area near a lake . Hadley’s getaway was foiled when a neighbour called 911 to report his car stolen, according to WFTV, it didn’t take long for cops to finger Hadley as the thief. Oddly enough, Hadley had been hanging out with man who’s car he stole just the night before. ‘He was pulling out of the apartment complex when I saw him take off,’ the man told the station. Police responded to Hadley’s mother’s 911 call by visiting the apartment he and Oakes shared, instead of finding the young woman, they found evidence of a struggle and what WESH called a ‘brutal’ murder. Write caption here . Officials have yet to release details of the crime, or even an exact day of death. Separately, investigators found the body of the beautiful young Oakes dumped in a wooded area near a lake about 30 miles south of where she was killed, according to multiple reports. Neighbors of the couple told WFTV they often heard the young lovers fighting, and even saw Oakes' parents come to her aid more than once during the arguments. 'Her parents would come out here from time to time when they got in arguments,' a neighbor told WFTV. Busted: Hadley's getaway was foiled when a neighbor reported him for stealing this car . A spokesperson for the apartment complex told the station that police responded to a domestic violence incident at the apartment only three weeks ago. Around 5:30 Friday afternoon, cops spotted Hadley in Orlando and pursued him as he took off on foot, according to WFTV. He was arrested and booked on charges of second-degree murder,  resisting arrest and grand theft – for stealing his neighbor’s car.

"Donald Sterling, the National Basketball Association team owner who was hit last week by charges of racism, used his charitable foundation to steer at least $135,000 to charities that focus on African-American issues – including the Museum of Tolerance. A voice purported to be that of Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers franchise, was recorded in a racist rant chastising his reported mistress for associating publicly with black people. But through the Donald T. Sterling Foundation, which he set up in 2007, he donated $30,000 to the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, and $50,000 each to the United Negro College Fund and the Black Business Association of Los Angeles. Sterling's donations could be a form of public-relations inoculation against future criticism. None of those groups has publicly rebuked him since the tape surfaced on Friday. The United Negro College Fund told MailOnline on Monday that it won't give back the money. SCROLL DOWN TO HEAR THE RACIST RANT AND READ THE TAX RETURNS . Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling spent $135,000 on charities that work on issues surrounding African Americans and other minority groups -- standing inn sharp contrast with his alleged blatant racism . The Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles got $30,000 from Sterling, a gift that the organization hasn't said whether it will keep . 'UNCF has not had any conversation regarding returning money back to Donald Sterling,' the group's national communications director Anthony Owens said. 'All funds raised by UNCF are used to provide scholarships to help get minority students to and through school and we would never ask the student to return the money.' None of the other organizations responded to questions about whether they will send Sterling's money back. A separate $5,000 grant went to the Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP in 2010. That organization has rescinded its offer to present Sterling with its 2014 Lifetime Achievement Award. Sterling has already won the honor once before, in 2009. The grants came between 2009 and 2012. The foundation's 'Form 990' tax return for 2013 is not yet due to the Internal Revenue Service. The NAACP, . America's most visible African-American advocacy organization, received . a grant from Sterling's foundation in 2013, according to the NBA, but the amount has not yet been disclosed. A . voice that sounds like Sterling's is heard on the tape telling a woman . that 'it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you’re . associating with black people. Do you have to?' 'You . can sleep with them. You can bring them in, you can do whatever you . want,' the man says. 'The little I ask you is not to promote it on that . ... and not to bring them to my games ... in your lousy f****ing . Instagrams, you don’t have to have yourself with, walking with black . people.' The New York Times reported . Monday that Sterling's current racial black eye isn't his first: In . 2009 he paid a $2.725 million lawsuit settlement to dispense with the . U.S. Justice Department's charge that he systematically shoved Hispanic . and black  Americans, and families with children, out of his apartment . buildings. Rochelle Sterling, Donald's wife, is suing his alleged lover for the return of $1.8 million in cash, cars and other items he allegedly gave her -- reportedly leading to the mistress' leak of the tape . Embarrassed: Los Angeles Clippers players refused to wear their team jerseys during pre-game warmups in Oakland, California on Sunday . He hasn't . spoken publicly about whether the voice on the recording is his, but . sports columnists and broadcasters and NBA insiders are convinced. TMZ reported . Monday that his former mistress, the 38-year-old V. Stiviano, . reportedly has more than 100 hours of secretly made recordings, . including other conversations that could prove embarrassing to the . Clippers owner. She is also shopping a book to several publishers, the gossip website claimed. Stiviano now claims she was merely Sterling's 'archivist,' not his lover. Stiviano lawyer Mac Nehoray said in an e-mail Sunday to the Los Angeles Times that the male voice heard on the 15-minute recording, berating her for being seen in public with NBS legend Magic Johnson and her other black friends, is definitely Sterling's. NAACP Interim President Lorraine Miller told NBC's 'Meet the Press' on Sunday that Donald Sterling will not receive his group's lifetime achievement award, which this pre-printed program announces . Sterling, 81, has responded by claiming that the release of the tape to TMZ is Stiviano's attempt to exact revenge on his wife Rochelle for suing her over her husband's affair. That legal action seeks $1.8 in cash, property, cars and other items Sterling reportedly gave her – including a Ferrari, two Bentleys and an apartment worth more than $1 million. The Clippers  protested their owner Sunday night by stripping off their jerseys during a pre-game warmup, turning them inside-out so the logo couldn't be seen, and throwing them in the center of the basketball court.

'You’d think CEOs especially are measured by objective criteria, financial performance,' Stewart said.

Then co-host Simon Hobbs piped up, saying, 'I think Tim Cook is fairly open about the fact he’s gay at the head of Apple, isn’t he?' Speculation: Despite his sexuality being the subject of much speculation in the tech industry, Apple CEO Tim Cook has never confirmed that he is gay . For a moment, a deafening silence filled the studio as the hosts look awkardly from one to the other before Stewart, shaking his head in disapproval, responds with a succinct, 'No.' Hobbs tried to recover, 'Oh, dear, was that an error? I thought he was open about it.' The panel mentioned a recent New York Times article that all but outed the CEO, but Stewart declined to comment. 'I don’t want to comment about anybody who might or might not be. I’m not going to out anybody,' he said. Despite much speculation about his sexuality, Cook has never commented about whether or not he is gay. He's been an advocate for the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, which would make it illegal for employers to fire staff based on their sexual orientation, and mentioned in a speech he gave last year that he has been discriminated against. 'Since these early days, I have seen and have experienced many types of discrimination and all of them were rooted in the fear of people that were different than the majority,' he said.","CNBC's Squawk on the Street co-host Simon Hobbs outed Apple CEO Tim Cook live on-air .

"The food safety watchdog is to name and shame supermarkets that sell chicken contaminated with a dangerous food-poisoning bug after the scandal was exposed by the Daily Mail. The Food Standards Agency has been testing chicken sold in the high street for campylobacter, which is associated with 100 deaths a year and 280,000 food-poisoning cases. In August, officials said the names of shops involved should be kept secret until at least next summer following lobbying from stores, producers and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs over fears the news would damage the industry. Scroll down for video . Revealed: The Food Standards Agency has been testing chicken sold in the high street for campylobacter, which is associated with 100 deaths a year and 280,000 food-poisoning cases. (File picture) But following pressure from the Mail, academics and consumer groups, it has agreed to identify them. The results will reveal which of Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons, the Co-op, Waitrose, and Marks & Spencer has the highest contamination levels. The FSA began quarterly surveys of chicken sold on the high street in February to establish the levels of campylobacter. The first revealed that 59 per cent of 853 birds tested positive for the bug. Some 16 per cent of the roasting birds tested positive for the highest level of contamination. One in 20 sealed packs of chicken were even contaminated on the outside, suggesting that simply picking them up created a risk. The FSA said it would be unfair to name the stores because its sample sizes were small and the public would not understand the results. Tested: The results will reveal which of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons, the Co-op, Waitrose, and Marks & Spencer has the highest contamination levels. (File picture) However, the figures will now be published in a more user-friendly format from November, by which time the FSA will have analysed the results of two surveys. Richard Lloyd, of the consumer group Which?, said: ‘It’s a win for consumers. People have a right to know which retailers are not performing well.’ Erik Millstone, professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, said: ‘The FSA was supposed to be independent of commercial and political pressures. Recent events show that in practice the FSA was blown off course by industrial and political pressures.’ FSA policy director Steve Wearne said: ‘We want people to have the clearest possible information on the food they buy.'","FSA has been testing chicken sold in the high street for campylobacter .

A salmonella strain which infected 247 people has been traced to cheap eggs imported from Germany. The outbreak was initially linked to egg dishes at Chinese restaurants, and some 54 people across the UK needed hospital treatment for food poisoning. Three sick patients who caught the bug at a Birmingham hospital went on to die. The Food Standards Agency said evidence pointed to the salmonella strain – which was also found in France, Germany and Austria – coming from a single German egg supplier."
"British scientists believe they have found evidence alien life after sending a balloon to the edge of space. The team of scientists sent a balloon 27km into the stratosphere and captured small biological organisms they say can only have come from space. The group, headed up by astrobiologist Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, claims the 'seeds of life' have been transported between planets by passing meteors. Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe is best known as the only scientist to argue against evolution during the 1981 Arkansas legal case against the teaching of creationism in schools. Now he claims that plankton on the ISS came from outer space and not from Earth . Professor Wickramasinghe, 74, and his team . from the University of Sheffield sent a specially designed balloon into . the atmosphere above Chester during the annual Perseid meteor shower. The balloon was carrying sterile microscope slides which were only exposed to the atmosphere at heights of 27km. When the balloon fell back down to Earth the scientists discovered microscopic aquatic algae on the microscope slides - which they say can only be alien life forms. Professor Wickramasinghe, 74, and his team from the University of Sheffield sent a specially designed balloon into the atmoshphere during the annual Perseid meteor shower last month in August . Their findings were published in a paper during the Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology conference in San Diego, USA, last month. Prof Wickramasinghe said: 'Biological entities of this nature have not previously been reported occurring in the stratosphere. 'The entities varied from a presumptive colony of ultra-small bacteria to two unusual individual organisms - part of a diatom frustule and a 200 micron-sized particle mass interlaced with biofilm and biological filaments.' He said these findings were evidence for the theory of 'cometary panspermia'. This states that the 'seeds of life' exist all over the Universe and travel through space from one planet to another. The left image shows an unidentified 'alien' biological complex organism with a segmented neck connected to a flask-shaped body. On the right collapsed 'alien' organism with a 'proboscis'- or head of the animal- with 2 nostril-like openings and a 'sphincter'-like opening at the top . When the balloon fell back down to Earth the scientists discovered microscopic aquatic algae on the microscope slides - which they say can only be alien life forms. An internal microscopic image of an alien mass of bacteria found is pictured above . In a separate study, scientists have recently found never before seen material inside rock that crashed to Earth in California last year. The discovery comes from an analysis of the Sutter's Mill meteorite, which lit up the California night sky with a dazzling fireball in April 2012. Meteor fragments are rich in organic compounds – many of which are found in living organisms on Earth – and the newly discovered molecules could shed light on the origins of life on our planet. Arizona State University, who undertook the study, claims the molecules likely formed several billion years ago in conditions similar to those on early Earth. Sceptics believe 'biological entities' captured in the stratosphere could have been carried high into the atmosphere from Earth - and not from space. But Prof Wickramasinghe said: 'The biological entities found are particles of relatively large size and mass. 'By our current understanding of the means by which such particles can be transferred from Earth to the stratosphere they could not - in the absence of a violent volcanic eruption occurring within a day of the sampling event - make such a journey. 'If there is no mechanism by which these biological entities could be elevated from Earth to the stratosphere then it must have arrived from above the stratosphere and have been incoming to Earth.' The Sri Lankan-born British mathematician, astronomer and astrobiologist is one of the leading proponents of the theory of cometary panspermia. Panspermia is Greek for 'seeds everywhere'. The panspermia theory states that seeds of life can be spread through space from one location to another. and that life on Earth may have originated through this process. It requires meteors blasted from a planet’s surface serve to act as transfer vehicles for spreading biological material from one planet to another.","Scientists found algae after sending a balloon into the stratosphere .

But what is it that gives Taylor her edge, how has she found universal popularity with people all over the world? Scroll down for video . Who wears short shorts? Taylor performs in a pair of gold detailed hot-pants on stage in New York . Taylor is known for her super stylish outfits. For a TV appearance (left) she went for a chic LBD. When travelling (center) she opts for a more comfortable shift dress. (Right) Taylor leaves the studio in New York in a grey coat . Taylor is well known for writing about her exes. Her new track 'Are We Out Of The Woods Yet?' is widely thought to be about Harry Styles (left). She also loves to perform with her good pal Ed Sheeran (right) Femail spoke to psychologist Linda Papadopoulos author of ‘Whose Life If It Anyway’ who said that Taylor’s appeal lies in the fact that she speaks honestly to her fans. 'Taylor talks about the stuff that matters to young girls. She talks about heartbreak, about people being mean to you, about not fitting in, about being worried about your looks. ‘It really resonates with the people who listen to her music. And with someone like Taylor they really believe that they could be her friend.’ Taylor's album 1989 is the fastest selling album in the last 12 years. Taylor is well known for being open and honest about her personal life. In fact, she will readily admit that most of her musical material is  about her own experiences whether they be with men or with friends. She recently revealed that 1989 is about a lot of her past relationships and growing up. Taylor said, ‘On this album, I'm writing about more complex relationships, where the blame is kind of split 50-50. ‘I'm writing about looking back on a relationship and feeling a sense of pride even though it didn't work out. ‘[And] reminiscing on something that ended but you still feel good about it, falling in love with a city, falling in love with a feeling rather than a person.’ Linda went on to say, ‘Taylor is always consistent with her message. We all expect with celebrities that there is going to be a big difference between what they say and what they do but with Taylor that doesn’t happen. Taylor larks about with her close friend Lena Dunham in this cute Instagram snap. Linda says part of Taylor's popularity comes from her being so relatable - we can see why! Taylor is often spotted out and about with her gal pals. (Left) she hangs out with fellow singer Lorde at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards in August. (right) She was spotted with Karlie Kloss watching the New York Knicks . 'She seems to behave very much in the same way whether it be in her private life or her personal life so her fans know where they stand with her.’ Linda explains that much of Taylor’s appeal comes from the fact that she offers a change from over-sexualised stars such as Rihanna, Rita Ora and Nicki Minaj. Stars who are as well known for dancing around in risque outfits as they are for their music. According to our experts Taylor is so popular because she provides an antidote to performers like Rihanna (left) and Nicki Minaj (right) who some view as over-sexualised . ‘I speak to a lot of young girls who don’t feel like they want to be that sexual and Taylor provides that alternative. ‘She bridges the gap. She says you can be sexy sometimes but you can also geek out and just have fun with your friends.’ Plus she works hard, ‘It also helps that she writes her own music. Young people are becoming incredibly savvy to the way in which in the music industry works and the smoke and mirrors but she has that authenticity. ‘You know you see some people telling young women to ""do this"" and ""do that"" but Taylor is just sharing her experiences. She’s very honest and open about that and that’s a lot of her appeal.’ Taylor Swift was born on December 13th 1989 and was raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. However it wasn't until she was 14 when she moved to Nashville that she began crafting her career starting out as a country singer. In 2005 she was signed to independent label Big Machine Records and started working on her first album, Taylor Swift. Even at a young age Taylor was a strong song-writer, penning three of the tracks for her first release on her own. After touring extensively Taylor began to gain huge popularity across the US. In fact, by 2008 she had been nominated for the Best New Artist award at the Grammies - she lost out to Amy Winehouse. It was in the same year that she began working on her second studio album, Fearless. She wrote seven tracks on the album and became the first ever country artist to win an MTV Video Music Award. She's dated some pretty famous men: Taylor counts Joe Jonas (left), Taylor Lautner (center) and John Mayer (right) among her ex boyfriends . Come 2009 and people were not only beginning to pay attention to Taylor's music but her love life also. Following her break up from Joe Jonas in 2008 she dated Taylor Lautner and John Mayer in 2009, famously going on to write the track 'Dear John' about him. In 2010 she released her third album, Speak Now. Not only was it the first time she had written the whole album herself, it also marked her move into a more poppy sound.  She won the American Music Awards 'Artist of the Year' award in 2011. During 2011 and 2012 she toured extensively on a 111 date world-tour inviting acts such as Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj and Selena Gomez to join her for special one off performances. Completing her transition into global superstar in 2012 Taylor released Red working with her friend Ed Sheeran and Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody on tracks such as 'Everything has changed' and 'The Last Time.' Before the release of her current album 1989, Red was her best selling album. She shifted a huge 1.208million copies. Martine Parnell, Director of Marketing at ticket marketplace Seatwave says that on an industry level Taylor's popularity stems from the fact that she appeals to a wide audience. ‘Taylor Swift's popularity boils down to her remarkably broad appeal. She has the ability to write the ultimate pop song that transcends era, fashion and genre. ‘It catches the ear of everyone no matter whether they believed themselves Taylor Swift fans before and she delivers a live performance second to none. ‘Where her contemporaries like Miley Cyrus and Iggy Azalea play to the sound of moment, Taylor is poised to become the female icon of her generation and her fans can’t wait for her  tour next year.’ Taylor recently announced her plans for a 1989 world tour. So far she has announced 57 dates across North America and Europe.","Taylor's album 1989 sold 1.287million copies in the first week .

"Seen side by side for the first time, this pair of pets look like they could be mother and daughter. While there is 12 years between them, however, these two dachshunds have identical genes – and are Britain's first cloned dogs. Scientists took a skin sample from the older dog, Winnie, to help manufacture a genetically identical embryo. The result, Mini-Winnie, was born in March and was flown to Britain on Saturday after being cared for by experts in South Korea for five months. Two of a kind: Britain's first clone dog 'minnie winnie' with her 12-year-old genetic mother 'Winnie' Mini-Winnie's owner Rebecca Smith, from Battersea, won a competition to have her dog reproduced from her DNA in a laboratory in Korea . The cloning process would normally cost £60,000, but owner Rebecca Smith, 29, had it done for free after winning a competition. At the weekend the puppy met her elderly double for the first time, and while they are not identical – Winnie naturally shows the signs of ageing – the resemblance between the two was clear to see. Miss Smith said: 'Mini-Winnie looks just like Winnie did when she was a puppy. Big Winnie has put on weight and looks grey now but they have the same markings. 'They both have big ears and nipples which aren't quite aligned. They even both have little bent tails.' Miss Smith, a caterer from Battersea, South London, was given Winnie as an 18th birthday present and credits the dog with helping her through spells of bulimia and depression. She even plans to have her as a 'bridesmaid' at her wedding next year. She said: 'I'm really attached to Winnie, she's irreplaceable. But she's getting old, and everyone kept saying we should get another. Mini-Winnie, was born in March and was flown to Britain on Saturday after being cared for by experts in South Korea for five months . Rebecca Smith won a South Korean contest to clone her dog, a technique would usually cost £60,000 . The dachshund is the first dog in Britain to be cloned, having been imported from South Korea . 'My boyfriend joked that we should get her cloned, but we never thought that would have been possible. Then we entered a competition in a newspaper and ended up winning.' Scientists at the Sooam Biotech Research Foundation flew Winnie's skin cells to their lab in Seoul in South Korea, where the DNA was extracted and placed into a donor egg. After fertilisation the egg was inserted into a dog surrogate to develop into an embryo. Miss Smith travelled to South Korea to witness the birth of Mini-Winnie on March 30 . Miss Smith said: 'Mini-Winnie looks just like Winnie did when she was a puppy' Miss Smith says Mini-Winnie has been given a clean bill of health and should live to the average age of a dachshund, 15 years . Miss Smith travelled to South Korea to witness the birth of Mini-Winnie on March 30. The pup weighed only 1lb at birth and has been kept in quarantine since then. On Saturday, the dog made the 15-hour flight to London to start a new life with its double. 'It was pretty amazing,' Miss Smith said. 'We put them both on the carpet and they went up to each other and had a little sniff. The dog made the 15-hour flight to London to start a new life with its double on Saturday . Miss Smith said: 'We put them both on the carpet and they went up to each other and had a little sniff' After fertilisation the egg was inserted into a dog surrogate to develop into an embryo . 'But then the little one tried to eat Winnie's chew and she put her foot down to that.' She added: 'Their personalities do seem to be slightly different. 'Winnie is very placid and laid-back. She likes to sleep and it's quite hard to make her walk. Miss Smith plans to have the two dogs follow her down the aisle when she marries fiance Alex Bourne, 30 . Paws for thought: Campaigners have criticised the cloning practice as ethically dubious . Mini-Winnie, the cloned puppy of Rebecca Smith who won a competition from South Korean company Sooam Biotech Research Foundation to clone her pet . The only thing that Miss Smith was unsure about is the temperament and personality of her dog-clone, and she'll have to wait for her pup to grow up to be able to tell . 'In contrast, Mini-Winnie is, at the moment, very playful and bouncy and excitable. She loves going out to the park. 'Mini-Winnie has gone slightly off her food because she's in a new environment, and at the moment will only eat fresh meat. We keep putting out doggie biscuits for the puppy and then we'll come back and Winnie will be eating them. Rebecca chose to clone her dog because of the irreplaceable bond she had to the original hound who saw her through so much of her life . The pup weighed only 1lb at birth and has been kept in quarantine since then . 'But one thing they both have in common is they sleep together in my bed every night, and they tend to sleep right through. 'They seem very happy in each other's company.' Miss Smith plans to have the two dogs follow her down the aisle when she marries fiance Alex Bourne, 30, a businessman – with Winnie as her Maid of Honour. She added: 'I want her to know how important she is, which is why we've had her cloned.' Sooam Biotech Research Foundation produced the world's first cloned dog, called Snuppy, in 2005 and has since cloned hundreds more. Campaigners have criticised the practice as ethically dubious. Dolly the sheep, the world's first cloned mammal, was created at Edinburgh University in 1996 but was plagued by health problems and put down at the age of six. Miss Smith says Mini-Winnie has been given a clean bill of health and should live to the average age of a dachshund, 15 years.","Scientists took a skin sample from the older dog, Winnie .

"Britain’s spy chiefs have launched a recruitment drive for Russian-speaking agents amid mounting tensions with the Kremlin. MI5, responsible for protecting the UK against terror attacks and other security threats, has placed an advert on its website calling for Russian language specialists to apply. The drive comes amid warnings of a new Cold War between Russia and the West as tensions continue to rise over the military stand-off in Ukraine. A new recruitment campaign for Russian speaking spied has been launched by MI5 and the Government’s eavesdropping centre GCHQ . Up to 50 Russian spies are said to be operating in Britain, with ex-MI5 boss Jonathan Evans claiming there has been ‘no decrease in the number of undeclared Russian intelligence officers in the UK’ since the end of the Cold War. In 2010 Russian Katia Zatuliveter was accused of being a Kremlin spy after it emerged she had had an affair with Commons Defence Committee MP Mike Hancock. She denied the claim and later won an appeal against deportation from the UK. The scandal came after a ring of 10 Russian spies were rounded up and deported from the US. One of the spies, Anna Chapman, had lived and worked in London before marrying and gaining a British passport. The new recruitment campaign is being run jointly with Government’s eavesdropping centre GCHQ, which gathers intelligence for the Government and Armed Forces by tapping phones and monitoring the internet. Russian spy Anna Chapman (left) was deported from the US in 2010 while Katia Zatuliveter was accused of being a Kremlin agent who had an affair with Liberal Democrat MP Mike Hancock while working for him in Parliament . MI5 are also looking for Mandarin-speakers following increasing tensions with China over British ‘interference’ over the civil rights protests in Hong Kong. A job vacancy advert placed on the MI5 website reads: ‘Coming soon: A recruitment campaign for Russian language specialists/linguists in conjunction with our sister agency. ‘This will launch in mid-November 2014 and will be an exciting opportunity to match your language skills to a position in MI5 of GCHQ.’ Another similar advert for language specialists is also listed online but with ‘Russian’ replaced by ‘Mandarin’, the most-spoken language in China. MI5 chief Andrew Parker (left) and the head of GCHQ, Robert Hannigan (right), are advertising for Russian speaking spies . The Mandarin advert states that posts will also be open at MI6, which is responsible for intelligence gathering overseas. The two adverts offer salaries of up to £30,000 in London, where MI5 and MI6 are based, and in Cheltenham, home to GCHQ. British relations with Russia have plummeted over the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, prompting the UK, US and EU to impose economic sanctions. Tensions with China, a global superpower, have also heightened in recently over the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, a former British colony.","MI5 has placed job advert on website calling for Russian language specialists .
