"This is the moment a man saw the elderly homeless woman he gives money to every day - driving a new car. Daniel Ayala walked past the Shell garage on his way to work for weeks to hand a few notes to the panhandler sat on the corner. One day, he missed lunch to give her $4. But he was sent in to a foul-mouthed rage on Wednesday when he passed by to see her in a 2013 red Fiat. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rage: Daniel Ayala was enraged when he saw the beggar he gives money to driving a brand new Fiat . Charitable: He holds up four fingers as he shouts, 'Thursday, I did not eat to give you $4!' Their encounter in Oklahoma City - filmed by another duped citizen - shows Ayala screaming at the woman, who claimed to be a 78-year-old widow too poor to afford food. 'This is crazy!' he shouts. 'You are asking for money in the middle of street and you drive a 2013 car? 'Listen, I work hard for my money. I don't appreciate this sh*t. And that's why people like you take advantage of people like me. This is bullsh*t!' Turning around rubbing his face in shock, he then exclaims: 'You drive a better car than me!' The woman protests that it is not her car; that her son is going to pick her up. 'So you're telling me you're not going to drive this car?' he shouts. Duped: He walked past the Shell garage in Oklahoma City every day for weeks to donate money to the woman .

Ayala then rages that if he sees the car again the next day, he will 'bust a window'. 'I work f***ing hard!' he tells her, '40 hours! I see you hungry, I give you, everyday, $3, $2 — Thursday, I did not eat to give you $4,' he added. 'I better not see this car tomorrow.'

"A Nigerian teenager held captive by ruthless Islamist group Boko Haram has told for the first time how a sympathetic member of the terrorist group who spoke her local language helped her escape. Amina Tsawur, 17, who was kidnapped alongside hundreds of classmates, has revealed how she managed to trick her captors and escape through snake-infested undergrowth in northern Nigeria. She said a member Boko Haram, led by Abubakar Shekau, dubbed the Beast of Boko Haram, told her to ask to be moved away from the other hostages so she could relieve herself. Scroll down for video . Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has claimed responsibility for kidnapping the 300 girls and is threatening to sell them . She followed his instructions, then ran through the jungle and reached a highway where a passing motorist drove her to a nearby town. She revealed that during her ordeal her kidnappers taunted and insulted their captives, and  threatened to kill them and their teachers. Today, The Mail on Sunday can also report how: . Amina Tsawur remains traumatised by the thought of her friends being raped, abused and enslaved by Boko Haram gunmen. International model Cara Delevingne joined the social media campaign calling for the release of the kidnapped school girls . Puff Daddy has also given his support to the campaign to free the kidnapped girls . Describing the moment of her capture, she said: ‘It was about llpm and we were very scared to hear shooting. We didn’t know what to do or where to run. ‘After some time we started seeing men in soldiers’ uniforms coming in the school by torchlight. 'We thought they were soldiers. They said they had been sent to evacuate us so we would not be harmed. ‘We followed them outside and they got us into a lorry. When they shouted ‘Allahu Akhbar’ [God is great], we knew they were Boko Haram. ‘We all started crying and begging for help, but they ordered us to keep shut or they would kill us. ‘They took us into the bush and we drove all night and in the morning too, until we arrived at a place where they asked some of us to cook, others to wash dishes, some to grind corn and other chores. ‘They kept insulting us and saying that we must stop going to school, that they were going to marry all of us to their people; that our teachers and government are unbelievers whom they would all kill.’ After her escape, Amina eventually . reached Damboa, a market town on the edge of the jungle, 50 miles from . Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State. In total, 50 girls are believed . to have fled after the kidnapping on April 14. Schoolgirls Aminar Tsawur, right, and Martha, left, being reunited with their family after being kidnapped by the Boko Haram terrorists from their school in Chibok, Nigeria . Last night, counter-terrorism expert Robin Horsfall, a veteran of the SAS’s storming of the Iranian Embassy in 1980, said Amina would be a crucial intelligence asset in the hunt for Boko Haram’s leaders. ‘She’s got faces, languages, tribes, directions of movement, vehicles, a huge amount of vital information to pass on to the Nigerian military,’ he said. ‘Its officers are very capable, well educated and professional. ‘British Special Forces might play a role as technical advisers, in a bid to reduce casualties. But this is delicate ground.’ Defence sources have told this newspaper how, soon after the kidnapping, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan was assured by his military advisers that they could handle every aspect of the crisis. This was apparently why he turned down a British offer of SAS help. He later changed his mind and at least 12 additional  SAS soldiers have since deployed to Nigeria from their base in Hereford. A majority of people surveyed by the Mail on Sunday said the SAS, pictured, should be deployed to Nigeria . Mr Horsfall added: ‘In the President’s defence, the Nigerian army and air force are accustomed to dealing with kidnap situations because these incidents happen a lot there. ‘But by now the girls are likely to have been split up as assets to be bought and sold.’ Last night, Enoch Mark, whose daughter and two nieces were taken by the gunmen, claimed that teachers at the school received a tip-off that the Boko Haram raid was going to take place. Mr Mark, a pastor, said: ‘Some students whose parents were staff at the school, nothing happened to them because I was told that they were informed. So they checked out their daughters and sent them home.’ But last night sources in Chibok claimed some girls were not at school because they had been sent home to revise for their exams. Yesterday, First Lady Michelle Obama said she and her husband Barack were ‘outraged and heartbroken’ over the abduction. Making her husband’s weekly presidential address, she said: ‘In these girls Barack and I see our own daughters; we see their hopes and their dreams, and we can only imagine the anguish their parents are feeling.’ She was speaking after a Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday revealed that 56 per cent of 1,000 UK respondents believe Britain should offer SAS help with the rescue operation.","Amina Tsawur managed to convince one terrorist to release her as they spoke the same local dialect .

"Rolands Brize burnt down his family home in Latvia before deciding to move to Britain . A young woman who was subjected to a vicious sexual assault has given the first full account of her torment after waiting more than a year to see her attacker sentenced. The 24-year-old, who came within seconds of being raped, launched a blistering attack on the justice system, which she said pandered to the rights of criminals while ignoring those of the victims. Yesterday the woman described her terrifying ordeal after the judge described the case as ‘a scandal’. Latvian migrant Rolands Brize pleaded guilty to attempted rape, yet after 11 court adjournments over matters including a lack of Latvian-speaking nurses, he has still not been sentenced. The victim was grabbed from behind while walking home last March but escaped Brize’s grasp to call 999, giving her location as Myton Bridge in Hull. But as she spoke to operators, Brize seized her again and dragged her under the bridge. Police arrived to find him on top of her. ‘I’ve never screamed or cried so much in my life,’ she said. ‘The 999 call wasn’t cut off, and I’ve been told the recording is one of the most horrific things because they could hear the screams for help. ‘I wasn’t going to let him do what he wanted to do, so I put up a fight. I managed to get away and run up on to the bridge, but he ran after me, grabbed me the second time and dragged me back down the slipway. He had me pinned to the ground. ‘I grabbed the railings to try to pull myself back up and he hit me. Then I remember seeing this shadow and this light, and it was a policeman – they’d turned up and managed to get him just in time.’ Hull Crown Court, where the case is being heard. The judge said he will pass sentence next month, regardless of whether a psychiatric evaluation has been completed on Brize . Though the assault was over, another ordeal was about to start as the case dragged on despite the guilty plea of homeless Brize, who had a history of mental illness in Latvia and burnt down his family home before coming to this country. Recalling seeing him in court, the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ‘It was quite horrific. He turned and made eye contact. It’s the worst feeling. ‘The only thing which made me feel slightly better was that on the night... he had the upper hand, but when I saw him [in court] he looked ill and tired and like he was in the worst position of the two of us,’ she told Radio 4’s Today programme. The victim hoped the case would be over by the end of last year, but sentencing was repeatedly delayed because doctors had not had a chance to gauge Brize’s mental state. ‘It’s been quite tough,’ the woman said. ‘It’s not clear every time why it’s been adjourned – they need more time to assess him, or the right bed’s not available… not having the right level of security… no Latvian-speaking nurses to ensure he gets the best care. ‘His human rights have been brought up, which I find hard to understand... The guy who did this to me has been treated better than I have. It’s gone on for so long, it’s so draining, and I don’t have faith in the justice system after this at all.’ Chadwick Lodge, the psychiatric hospital where Brize is being held . Brize, 25, is currently at Chadwick Lodge, a secure psychiatric hospital in Buckinghamshire owned by the Priory Group. It is reported to cost £500 a day to be treated there, though the company will not discuss fees charged to local authorities. Brize’s care bill has so far been estimated at £90,000. Last week Judge Mark Bury at Hull Crown Court said he will pass sentence next month, even if a psychiatric report is not ready. ‘This case is turning into a scandal and I will not have it,’ he said.","Latvian migrant Rolands Brize pleaded guilty to attempted rape .

"Will Mauricio Pochettino lead Spurs into the Champions League next season? Will Mauricio Pochettino lead Spurs into the Champions League next season? Now share your opinion . The hard work starts here for Mauricio Pochettino. Firing Tottenham into the Champions League positions next season will be no mean feat. But truth be told, the Argentine has already overcome a sizeable task in becoming Daniel Levy's latest managerial acquisition. The potential appointment of Ajax manager Frank de Boer was the prospect that really got Tottenham supporters' mouths watering. When the Dutchman publicly revealed . Tottenham's interest in him last month, it seemed the start of the road . towards De Boer's appointment. In fact, it was the beginning of the end of his chances of replacing Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane. Dawn of a new era? Mauricio Pochettino has signed a five-year-deal to become Tottenham manager . In the dugout: Pochettino resigned from Southampton on Tuesday to join the White Hart Lane outfit . Second best: Ajax manager Frank de Boer was also in the running for the Tottenham job . Levy insists on private club business staying private, particularly when it concerns something as delicate as a managerial appointment. De Boer's decision to go public with Spurs' interest riled certain figures at White Hart Lane, and, ironically, worked in Pochettino's favour. As Sportsmail revealed, Carlo Ancelotti was always Levy's dream managerial choice. But the chances of luring the Italian away from Real Madrid looked remote at best. Overlooked: De Boer's public talk of the Spurs job, irked the board who wanted it to remain confidential . Decision maker: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has appointed three Tottenham managers since December . With that in mind, Levy made his move for Pochettino. Work towards the South American's appointment has been ongoing behind the scenes for over a fortnight. Fears over Pochettino's grasp of English were soon allayed as Spurs chiefs discovered, despite his decision to use an interpreter for his press duties, that he communicates freely and confidently in English. As a result, he will be expected to conduct his public speaking in English, without the use of an interpreter. But just as Tottenham were laying the groundwork for the arrival of Pochettino, Southampton were just as busy; attempting to keep their highly-rated boss at St Mary's. The offer of a new three-year contract and the promise of a healthy transfer kitty were made, providing Pochettino with somewhat of a dilemma. But in his heart-of-hearts Pochettino's mind was made up; a chance of moving to a club the size of Tottenham does not come around often. Even last week, however, when Pochettino looked nailed on to replace Sherwood, things could easily have turned out differently. It is understood further contact between Tottenham and De Boer took place at the start of last week as decision time loomed for Levy and Co. Deposed: Tim Sherwood was sacked as Spurs boss in May despite signing an 18-month contract in December . Winning smile: Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti was Levy's dream candidate for the Tottenham hotseat . Going into the weekend it was virtually neck-and-neck between Pochettino and De Boer. 'Pochettino has a 51 percent chance, De Boer 49,' said one source. And when Real Madrid lifted their 10th European crown in Lisbon on Saturday night, thus ending any hope of luring Ancelotti back to the capital, Levy knew it was time. Pochettino or De Boer? The former Espanyol manager's five-year deal at White Hart Lane seems a strong commitment given Levy's penchant for hiring and firing. Familiar face: Pochettino could raid former club Southampton for striker Jay Rodriguez . And it's hiring and firing that will take up much of Pochettino's time between now and the start of the season. He will be given a healthy transfer budget to strengthen the Spurs squad, with Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez among the early contenders to follow him from St Mary's. But last summer's splurge on over £100million worth of talent will mean there is not another blow out. Pochettino will be expected to coax the best out of his star-studded squad; in particular £30million misfit Erik Lamela. Last hurrah? Emmanuel Adebayor (right) could be leaving Tottenham following Pochettino's appointment . The Argentine will look to supplement his transfer budget by offloading a clutch of players: Emmanuel Adebayor, who is a target for Monaco, Roberto Soldado and Michael Dawson are among those who could go. Similarly, Pochettino will seek talks with unsettled duo Jan Vertonghen and Hugo Lloris, who are both keen on moves to Champions League club's this summer. It's already been a busy summer for Pochettino; and it's about to get busier.","Mauricio Pochettino signed a five-year deal as Tottenham boss on Tuesday .

"A billionaire couple have forked out $10 million of their own cash to pay for care for some of the poorest children in society amid the continuing US Government shutdown. Laura and John Arnold have dipped into their personal fortune of $2.8 billion to reopen seven Head Start programmes in six states. The government shut down last week when Congress failed to agree a budget, although there are now said to be 'glimmers of hope' of a resolution, with President Barack Obama indicating he would accept a short-term increase in borrowing to avoid a default. Donation: Billionaire couple John and Laura Arnold have pledged cash to keep Head Start programmes open . Head Start programmes, which prepare . about 7,000 youngsters described by spokeswoman Sally Aman as 'the . poorest of the poor' for kindergarten, had been forced to close when the . government closed many of its own offices last week. According to NBC, the centers had been expecting to receive their much-needed Federal grants on October 1, but when the Government closed its doors were left high and dry without the cash they needed to stay open. The philanthropic couple said in a statement: 'We . believe that it is especially unfair that young children from . underprivileged communities and working families pay the price for the . legislature's collective failures. 'We . sincerely hope that our government gets back to work in short order, as . private dollars cannot in the long term replace government . commitments.' Executive director of Head Start National Association Yasmina Vinci said: 'The Arnolds have selflessly stepped . up for Head Start children to ensure their path toward kindergarten . readiness is not interrupted by the inability of government to get the . nation's fiscal house in order. The Association added that many low-income parents are unable to pay for alternative care for their children and are forced to take time off work when Head Start centers . close. Head Start spokeswoman Sally Aman . said while the donation would allow many centers to reopen today, the 'generous gift' would not support Head Start . programs if the shutdown continues throughout the month, affecting up to 11,000 other children. Brats: A protestor demonstrates against the first government shutdown in 17 years on Capitol Hill . Mr Arnold made his fortune as a hedge fund manager. His wealth valued at $2.8 billion by Forbes. He and wife Laura have three children of their own. The couple started a charity foundation in 2008, although this money is being made as a personal donation. Their publicist Gary Larson said: 'The . Arnolds were both quite moved after learning about the impact the . government shutdown would have on so many Head Start children, so they . came forward personally, rather than through their foundation, and . offered this assistance as their way of helping. While a resolution to the ongoing government stand-off is still some way off, Yahoo has reported 'glimmers of hope'. According to the news website, President Obama said he would accept a short-term increase in the nation's borrowing to avoid a default. In a separate development, a senate aide said Republican Senator Rob Portman was working on a plan to cut federal spending and reform the US tax code as part of a broader deal to reopen government agencies. Most lawmakers believe such a budget deal will be necessary to end the dispute. The President's press secretary said Obama would accept a short-term debt ceiling increase in order to get past the potential crisis date of October 17, when the government hits the $16.7 trillion borrowing limit. A short-term increase would give both the Republicans and Democrats some breathing room, but will not solve the dispute alone. Healthcare: The Republican movement is seeking to delay President Obama's flagship policy . The US Federal Government shut down for the first time in 17 years last week because Congress failed to pass a budget before the start of the new financial year on October 1. The shutdown arose after the majority Republican group in the House of Representatives was unable to agree the budget with the Senate's Democrat majority. Some of the Republicans involved, many of whom have links to the right-wing Tea Party movement, oppose President Barack Obama's healthcare reforms. They are believed to have voted for budget measures to delay the healthcare changes passed by Congress in 2010. About 800,000 government workers have been sent home without pay, while one million more are now working without pay. When the government last shutdown in 1996, it took 20 days to resolve the issues involved. There are fears it could still be a number of weeks before Congress overcomes this latest dispute.","John and Laura Arnold have dipped into their personal $2.8 billion fortune .

"Data for the first 12 months of the . Work Programme showed the £5billion initiative secured lasting . employment for just one in every 50 people referred, at a cost of . £14,000 a job. The . scheme – personally championed by the Prime Minister – pays private . sector firms such as A4e and G4S to find jobs for the long-term . unemployed. But of the . 785,360 people referred to the Work Programme in its first year, just . 18,270 were found a lasting job – equal to just 2.3 per cent. Champion: The back-to-work scheme is a flagship programme for the . PM while Employment Minister Mark Hoban insisted it was still early days for . the £5billion scheme . Officials . at the Department for Work and Pensions had estimated that 5 per cent . would find jobs on their own if the scheme did not exist, and firms were . set a minimum target of getting 5.5 per cent of ‘clients’ into work in . the first year. Employment . minister Mark Hoban said last night it was ‘early days’, and pointed . out that the targets were set when economic growth forecasts were . better. He added that . more than 200,000 people had been found work  of some sort, although in . many cases this lasted only a few weeks or months. He said it was ‘clearly ridiculous’ to suggest that more people would have found jobs if the Work Programme had not existed. Only 3.5 per cent of people referred to the Work Programme in its first year stayed off benefits and in a job . Spending . on the programme so far totals £435million. Providers can earn between . £3,700 and £13,700 per person, depending how hard it is to help them, . with an initial payment of £400-£600. The . main payments are only made after someone has been in work for six . months – the Government’s definition of sustained employment. The figures reveal wide . variations in the performance of the companies involved, but Mr Hoban . said the worst had been warned they could be stripped of their contracts . unless they upped their game by next April. Labour . branded the scheme  a ‘miserable failure’, and shadow work and pensions . secretary Liam Byrne said the figures revealed it was ‘comprehensively . failing’. Over 50s are forced to become their own boss . Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons . public accounts committee, said the initiative was falling ‘woefully . short of expectations’. Woefully short of expectation: Chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, Margaret Hodge criticised the scheme . She added: ‘The success of this . programme will be measured on getting people off unemployment benefit . and into sustainable jobs who without the programme would not have found . work. ‘There is little value to the taxpayer or society in having people sitting on a scheme for over  two years.’ Individuals . are placed on the programme for two years, meaning a full assessment of . it will not be possible for another 12 months. Officials . said the most recent figures, covering the scheme’s first 14 months, . suggested it was starting to take off, with the jobs rate improving . slightly to 3.5 per cent. Public . concern over the programme erupted earlier this year when it emerged . that A4e boss Emma Harrison had paid herself £8.6million last year, . despite claims that the firm’s record in finding jobs for the unemployed . was ‘abysmal’. It also emerged that the firm was being investigated by the police over allegations of fraud. Mrs . Harrison was forced to resign as the company’s chairman and quit her . role as Mr Cameron’s ‘back to work’ tsar in the resulting row, although . she remains the main shareholder in A4e.","The Work Programme pays companies and charities if they get long-term unemployed into a job .

"Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl suffering from cystic fibrosis whose parents launched a national campaign to get onto an adult organ donor list, has successfully undergone surgery and received a new set of lungs. Her mother, Janet Ruddock Murnaghan posted on Facebook at around 8 p.m. Wednesday that her daughter was out of surgery and that doctors are 'very pleased with both her progress during the procedure and her prognosis for recovery.' Sarah went into surgery at around 11 a.m. this morning, and her parents were briefed on her progress throughout the six hour procedure. Surgeons had no challenges resizing or transplanting the lungs. Now out of surgery, Sarah is settling into an intensive care unit - the beginning of her recovery. 'We expect it will be a long road, but we're not going for easy, we're going for possible,' Sarah's mother wrote on Facebook. 'And an organ donor has made this possible for her.' Scroll down for video . Battle: Ten-year-old Sarah Murnaghan has been on the waiting list for a lung transplant for 18 months . Saved: Sarah's aunt Sharon Ruddock talks to press Wednesday after the successful surgery, saying that without the judge's ruling Sarah would have never received the life-saving transplant . Sarah and her family received news of the donation early on Wednesday. 'God is great! He moved the mountain! Sarah got THE CALL,' a statement posted on her Facebook page Wednesday . read. 'Please pray for Sarah's donor, her HERO, who has given her the . gift of life.' The plight of the ailing child . suffering from an end-stage lung disease has touched off a national . debate over organ transplant policies, which until now barred children . younger than 12 from the adult waiting list. At around 11am Wednesday, Sarah's mother shared with her Facebook followers that her daughter will be heading to the operating room in 30 minutes after the family were notified that a set of lungs has become available for transplant, as CNN first reported. 'Please pray for Sarah and her surgical team and our whole family! We are overwhelmed with emotions!!!! Thank you to all of you for the unending support, ' she wrote. 'Today is the start of Sarah's new beginning and new life!' On Wednesday afternoon, Sarah's mother spoke to a reporter from Fox 29 about her daughter's searching, describing the family as being nervous but  'excited' about the surgery because doctors had given her child about a week to live, and they were out of options. The mother went on to say that they got the news that a set of suitable lungs have become available at around 10.30pm Tuesday. However, the Murnaghans waited until this morning to share the good news with their supporters and the media in case the surgery got canceled in the last minute, which had happened three times in the past. 'We're just so thankful for the donor,' Ruddock Murnaghan said, adding that while it is a great day for her, it is not lost on her that it is a tragic day for the donor's family, who had lost a loved one, and that they are grateful to them. Recalling her final moments before Sarah was wheeled into surgery, her mother said that she gave her a kiss but was unable to say tell her anything because the 10-year-old has been in a medically induced coma since Saturday. 'They intubated her, she's paralyzed, she's not breathing on her own, so I’m not sure how much she's understanding me,' the mother said. According to the girl's mother, it may take as long as eight hours before Sarah wakes up, and the fact that she had spent two days in a coma would likely make her recovery more difficult, but the family remain optimistic. Last-minute miracle: Sarah's mother, Janet Ruddock Murnaghan, described the family as being nervous but  'excited' about the surgery because doctors had given her child about a week to live . 'We're getting new lungs, so she has a chance,' she said. 'She's a fighter.' Last week, the Murnaghans scored a . major victory when a judge ordered the Organ Procurement and . Transplantation Network to add the 10-year-old to the list for adult . lungs. The family's battle waged in the . media and on social networks has inspired other parents of children in dire need of organ transplants to . challenge the existing lung allocation process. Javier Acosta, 11, who suffers from . the same illness as Sarah, is now also awaiting a new set of lungs at . Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where the little girl is currently . undergoing surgery. On Wednesday, Mrs Murnaghan said . that had it not been for the judge's recent ruling, they would not have . gotten this set of lungs, which likely came from an adult or teenager. 'Sarah would've been number 400 or something on the list,' she said. The Organ Procurement and . Transplantation Network added the 10-year-old to the list on Wednesday night after . U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson's original ruling on June 5th U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said last Thursday. The . little girl, also remains on the priority list for a lung from a . pediatric donor, Sebelius said. However, her family, through their . official spokeswoman, said Sarah's condition had worsened. Sarah's parents had challenged existing transplant policy that made children under 12 wait for pediatric lungs to become available, or be offered lungs donated by adults after adolescents and adults on the waiting list had been considered. 'We are beyond thrilled,' Janet Murnaghan told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 'Obviously we still need a match.' The ruling applied only to Sarah, who has end-stage cystic fibrosis and has been awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. An expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds. In this May 30, 2013 file photo provided by the Murnaghan family, Sarah Murnaghan, center, celebrates the 100th day of her stay in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with her father, Fran, left, and mother, Janet . Loved: Her mother Janet, pictured, has just learned her daughter has a chance to live - after being approved for the adult organ transplant waiting list . Lung transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants, and children fare worse than adults, which is one reason for the existing policy, said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center. He called it troubling, and perhaps precedent-setting, for a judge to overrule that medical judgment, and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who don't like their place on the waiting list. 'I'm not sure I want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside,' Caplan said. Sarah's family, who live Newtown Square in suburban Philadelphia, filed suit Wednesday. The Murnaghans say pediatric lungs are rarely donated, so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations. Baylson suspended the age limit in the nation's transplant rules for 10 days for Sarah, who has been at the Philadelphia hospital for three months. A June 14 hearing on the request has been scheduled for a broader injunction. Holding on: Sarah's mother said her eldest daughter has just three to five weeks left to live . Support: Sarah, who has been living in hospital since February, is pictured with her three younger siblings . Nationwide, about 1,700 people are on the waiting list for a lung transplant, including 31 children under age 11, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Sebelius had declined to become involved in the case earlier this week, despite urgent pleas from several Pennsylvania congressmen. Sebelius said there were three other children at Children's Hospital alone in the same condition as Sarah. She has called for a review of pediatric transplant policies amid the higher death rates for pediatric patients, but the Murnaghans say Sarah doesn't have time for that. Sarah's doctors, one of whom testified Wednesday at an emergency hearing before Baylson, believe they can perform a successful transplant on her with adult lungs. 'She definitely understands things have improved quite a bit,' the girl's aunt, Sharon Ruddock, said after the ruling. The Murnaghans' attorney, Steve Harvey, said a committee of the organization that sets transplants policy may meet next week and he hoped it would change the policy. 'I hope that they decide to discontinue it completely for children under 12. I won't be satisfied until Sarah Murnaghan receives a set of lungs,' he said. 'The risk of her dying until she gets those lungs is high.' Joel Newman, spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing that operates the nation's transplant network, said he was unaware of any previous court order that overruled a transplant policy. 'Incredibly agonizing': U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a congressional panel on Tuesday that she wouldn't overrule federal regulations to help save young Janet . Sisterly: Despite her poor prognosis, Sarah remains upbeat about her chances of getting a transplant . Fears: Janet and Fran Murnaghan are now hopeful their daughter's life will be saved after she was placed on the adult transplant list . While many more adult lungs than children's lungs wind up being donated, the ruling doesn't guarantee Sarah a new set of lungs. The matches are based on blood type, the risk of dying, the chance of surviving a transplant and other medical factors. The donor lungs would also have to be an appropriate size for her chest. Newman said some lungs donated from deceased adults have been offered for children's transplants over the past two years, although he couldn't give a number. But he said all were turned down by the children's surgeons. The UNOS system was established to avoid bias in determining who gets organs, thus ensuring that the rich or celebrities, for example, don't have a better chance, Caplan noted. He said it is transparent, with policies open to public comment and scrutiny before they're enacted. 'When a judge steps in and says, 'I don't like these rules, I think they're arbitrary,' they better be very arbitrary or he's undermining the authority of the whole system. Why wouldn't anybody sue?'","At around 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sarah's mother announced on Facebook that her daughter was out of surgery and that doctor's said it went well .

"From today, it could cost you less to fly to Washington from London than getting a train from the UK capital to Edinburgh. Icelandic airline WOW Air is living up to its name by launching a new budget route that costs less than £100. The introductory fare is available through the airline's website to those booking a selected number of sale-price seats from today. The flights to America, which will take off from Gatwick on 27 March for just £99 one-way, stop off in Iceland before heading to Boston. Scroll down for video . Rock bottom prices: Icelandic airline WOW Air is  launching a new budget route that costs less than £100 . Wow Air: Skuli Mogensen (above), the budget airline's chief executive, said the routes were 'just the beginning of our plans to transform low-cost transatlantic flights' There will also be flights to Washington for the same price starting from 4 June. All will include a layover in Reykjavik, the small Icelandic capital. So far the website has been flooded with interest. 'The reaction has been great,' says Skúli Mogensen, CEO of WOW air. 'We have a significant amount of tickets available for this initial launch and there will be more avail throughout spring and autumn 2015.' The only caveat? The Reykjavik stopover will make the outbound flight to Boston over three hours longer than a direct trip and five and a half hours longer on the return leg. The flights will go via Keflavik International Airport, which is in the town (above) 30 miles west of Reykjavik . For Washington, the outbound and return journeys take around two hours and four hours longer than direct ones respectively. You might need to spend  more on extras too as the ticket price includes  5 kg of hand luggage. Checking in a bag will cost passengers £39 and to upgrade legroom from the standard 30 inches to 35 inches is £14. But for those who aren't in a rush, and don’t mind travelling light, this could open the door on transatlantic travel. The flight to Boston will take off from London five days a week and the Washington flight will leave four times each week. The flights from Reykjavik to the US will be operated using Airbus A321 Extended Range aircraft. WOW air’s existing Airbus A320 family aircraft will carry passengers from London Gatwick to Reykjavik on the first leg of the journey. Skúli Mogensen claims this is just the beginning of the airline’s plans to transform low-cost transatlantic flights. ‘Not only are we providing flights to the USA for less than a standard London to Edinburgh train ticket, we’re opening the market to a whole new market of travellers who might previously not have been able to afford transatlantic travel,’ he says. He added: ‘The low-cost airline market is scrambling to offer cheap flights to North America and I’m happy that we‘ll be among the first to do so and at a price point that will no doubt cause our rivals to re-evaluate their plans.’ American adventure: The flight to Boston (above) in Massachusetts will take off from London five days a week . And what of the future? 'We expect to continue to grow and passengers can expect to see more cheap flight routes to North America opening from WOW in the following two years.' They are not the first low cost airline looking to stretch to long haul services. Four months ago another budget Scandinavian airline, Norwegian, began offering direct flights from Gatwick to New York, Los Angeles and Fort Lauderdale for less than £150. But relatively few are priced at that marker and most, you’ll find when booking, cost more. The cheapest flight to New York in either November or December one-way with Norwegian at the moment is £209 while the cheapest flight in January 2015 is £179. Capitol gains: The flight to Washington (pictured) via Iceland on Wow Air will leave four times each week . Ryanair has previously said it hopes to launch flights to America for £10 each way but the airline does not currently have the medium or long-range aircrafts to offer the routes. Flying low: Ryanair has previously said it hopes to launch flights to America for £10 each way . Similarly Air Asia X and Jetstar have flown long haul and less successful attempts have been made by Laker Airlines and Zoom Airlines. Oasis Hong Kong went bankrupt in 2008 after launching flights from Hong Kong to Gatwick and Vancouver.","Wow Air flights will take off from Gatwick in March for just £99 one-way .

"Will Mauricio Pochettino lead Spurs into the Champions League next season? Will Mauricio Pochettino lead Spurs into the Champions League next season? Now share your opinion . Daniel Levy is a happy man. After the perceived debacle of Andre Villas-Boas and enduring months of boorish antics under Tim Sherwood, Tottenham believe they finally have their man. Judging by the chairman’s comments on Monday, Mauricio Pochettino is the one to claw back Champions League riches. That’s the mantra as he settles in at White Hart Lane following resignation at Southampton and subsequent appointment in north London. But, more to the point, Levy indicated that the Argentine will install that flowing, attractive football those around White Hart Lane are so fond of; The Tottenham Way. New man at the helm: Mauricio Pochettino was appointed as Tottenham manager on Monday . And he's gone: Tim Sherwood was unceremoniously dumped by Spurs at the end of the last season . ‘In Mauricio I believe we have a head coach who, with his high energy, attacking football, will embrace the style of play we associate with our club,' Levy enthused. 'He has a proven ability to develop each player as an individual, whilst building great team spirit and a winning mentality. 'We have a talented squad that Mauricio is excited to be coaching next season.' It’s a populist view. A Sportsmail Spurs blogger was cheerleading in the hours after the announcement that supporters’ enthusiasm centres on the ‘swashbuckling’ Saints side of last season. That appears to be a general consensus. Let’s not forget, however, that this is the same Southampton side which found the net 54 times in the Premier League last season – the exact same as Swansea City. Every team above them scored more. Pochettino doesn’t implore his side to pour forward; they keep the ball – pass, probe and weave their way to goal patiently and in a measured fashion. It served them exceptionally well and Southampton were one of the more attractive sides to watch. Happy man: Spurs chairman Daniel Levy believes Pochettino will bring back attacking football . That wasn't the problem! Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen were excellent going forward last year . However, if Tottenham fans – and, more importantly, the hierarchy – believe they’re in for a feast of goals they are likely to be disappointed. Swashbuckling Sherwood would be a more appropriate fit if success was measured by the goals-for column. During his time at the club Spurs scored more times than Arsenal with strikers largely derided for their impotency. Southampton didn’t actually see a marked difference in goalmouth action when Pochettino rocked up at St Mary’s. While in charge in the top flight, Nigel Adkins saw his side score 1.35 times a game. Pochettino’s record was 1.36. They created fewer chances than Newcastle United during the last campaign and, interestingly, boasted a poorer record than Swansea away. The 42-year-old is a sound choice given his record, but seemingly for the wrong reasons. In many ways, he is an extension of the meticulous Villas-Boas. Southampton’s defensive record was excellent under him, managing to keep clean sheets in 35 per cent of their games. Just what was required, given shipping goals was one of the deciding factors in Adkins rightly getting the boot in January 2013. Major blow: Southampton could now lose the likes of Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and James Ward-Prowse . Cautious? Southampton actually created fewer chances per game than Newcastle under Pochettino . Rock steady! Jose Fonte (left) and the rest of the Saints back four were superb throughout their campaign . It’s no bad thing that Pochettino is more cautious - a bit of solidity is exactly what Spurs require. There is a much smaller chance of his Spurs side conceding three against West Ham in front of their own supporters, as well as five against Liverpool and Manchester City. Away from home they shouldn't be allowing City, Liverpool or Chelsea to notch four or more. The facts tell their own story. Saints conceded 46 times last year, less than Brendan Rodgers’ Reds. As a direct comparison, Spurs saw the ball in their net on 51 occasions – more than Crystal Palace. Not good enough. He needs to land players who are going to make a difference in a defensive sense, particularly at centre half. Going off Levy’s past dealings with his employees, cash to fund that won’t be a problem. For any new manager at a club to have struggled, the way forward is by starting from the back and patience from above - not an attribute Spurs are renowned for. A five-year deal suggests, on the surface at least, that Pochettino will be afforded time. Boy, does he need it.","Pochettino resigned at Southampton and given five-year deal on Monday .
Daniel Levy and supporters are excited about his style of play .
Saints created fewer chances than Newcastle last season .
The Argentine is similar to Andre Villas-Boas and will build a back four .
His defensive record was excellent while at St Mary's .
Pochettino should prove an excellent choice at White Hart Lane ."
"Paedophile Jimmy Savile's claims to be close to the Queen's cousin were hushed up by police, it has been claimed. The disgraced ex-Top Of The Pops presenter told Surrey Police detectives in a 2009 interview that the first time he attended Duncroft Approved School for Girls in Staines, Surrey, was with Princess Alexandra, now 77. It is claimed that Savile abused girls at the school. Sir Angus Ogilvy, Princess Alexandra's husband (left) with Jimmy Savile. All mention of the former DJ's claims to friendship with the royal was initially omitted from police transcripts . All mention of Princess Alexandra, the youngest granddaughter of King George V and Queen Mary and the widow of Sir Angus Ogilvy, was blacked out when transcripts of the police interview were released in October. But following an appeal by the Daily Star Sunday to the Information Commissioner's Office, Surrey Police have released fresh transcripts with at least four mentions of her. He told detectives: '... right I went there, with Princess Alexandra, and Alex was a friend of mine anyway, still is.' Savile later added: 'Now that was a great day we all had, the first time I ever went there.' Princess Alexandra With Her Husband, Sir Angus Ogilvy. Savile claimed to be a friend of the Princess .

At this place I'm a cross between a term-time boyfriend and a fixer of special trips out.' In 2009 a prosecutor requested that all Savile's books be reviewed to see if there was any mention of Duncroft. The former radio DJ was discovered to be a prolific paedophile who may have raped 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450, including children as young as eight, after he died in 2011. He wrote in Duncroft's visitor book: 'Jimmy Savile called – and fell in love with all!!! I wonder if it’s legal to have 20 wives.' Chilling: Jimmy Savile at Duncroft School in 1974 .

"Facing a jail sentence: Sebastian Crump yesterday . A former Cabinet Office digital expert is facing jail after being caught with a huge stash of nearly 400 child porn images. Sebastian Crump amassed depraved images of child abuse while working as digital communications manager advising the Government on its own website. Now questions are being asked about why it took six months to emerge that a government official had been arrested over child pornography allegations. Police discovered indecent images were being streamed from Mr Crump’s home computer IP address in April last year. But incredibly last November – while he was still being investigated – he received a promotion at the Cabinet Office, where he had previously worked in internal communications. When Crump, 39, was arrested in January this year Scotland Yard did not publicise the arrest. He was only named when he was charged last month, but even then the Metropolitan Police did not reveal his role at the Cabinet Office. Details can only now be revealed after he pleaded guilty to four charges of making and distributing indecent images of children. Yesterday Crump – who has spent a decade working in technology and communications for Government offices, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Central Office of Information – insisted: ‘I’m not a paedophile.’ The case has reignited a row over secret arrests by police involving government officials accused of child porn offences. Lib Dem MP John Hemming said: ‘When they sat on the case for such a long time and then hid the fact that he is a senior civil servant, it causes great concern. ‘It does raise serious questions and alarm bells are ringing loudly.’ The Cabinet Secretary has already been asked to investigate the handling of a separate arrest of one of David Cameron’s closest aides. Patrick Rock, deputy director of the No 10 policy unit, was arrested on suspicion of hoarding images of naked children in February. The National Crime Agency refused to confirm or deny Mr Rock had been held or the existence of any inquiry, which was finally revealed by this newspaper. Mr Rock was brought in to Downing Street as deputy head of policy in 2011, and was involved in drawing up Government policy on tackling online child abuse images. Although Sebastian Crump’s work did not involve any child protection issues, the Mail can reveal he landed a government job after working as a children’s charity website manager. Civil servant: Crump worked as a Whitehall communications manager . The IT expert worked for Action for Children, which helps support vulnerable and neglected children, between 1998 and 1999. Last year while he was under investigation, he shared a picture on his Facebook page urging 11-year-old children to be safe on the internet. City of Westminster Magistrates Court heard that Crump hoarded nearly 400 indecent images of children, 82 of which were classed as the most extreme. At his £800,000 terraced home in Wandsworth, South London, police found 375 images and video files involving child and animal abuse. The court heard that Crump’s marriage had collapsed following his arrest. He pleaded guilty on Thursday to three counts of making an indecent image of a child and one count of distributing an indecent photograph of a child. But yesterday Crump insisted he was not a paedophile. Dressed in purple trousers, with dark glasses and a straw cowboy hat covering his frizzy ginger hair, the keen musician, who is part of the British Humanists Association Choir, emerged from his home in Southfields, South London. He insisted ‘I’m not a paedophile’, before sprinting off. Crump is on bail ahead of sentencing at Southwark Crown Court on August 28. A Cabinet Office spokesman said Crump was suspended in January and quit in March.

"Horrified: Labour peer Baroness Barbara Castle, pictured, tried to expose a ring of paedophiles . Special Branch officers seized a paedophile dossier naming Establishment figures drawn up by Labour peer Barbara Castle in the 1980s, it was claimed yesterday. Officers citing ‘national security’ confiscated the file which listed 16 MPs along with senior policemen, headteachers and clergy, it was said. The dossier was collated by the late Baroness Castle of Blackburn who handed it to Don Hale, the editor of her local newspaper, the Bury Messenger. Mr Hale claimed a ‘heavy mob’ of Special Branch officers raided his office in 1984 and took away the file, threatening him with prison if he resisted. And he said that the day before the raid, Liberal MP Cyril Smith – since exposed as a predatory paedophile – had also visited the office, demanding that he bury the story. It would be the second paedophile dossier to have ‘disappeared’. A year earlier, a file handed to former Home Secretary Leon Brittan by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens also went missing. This has now prompted Prime Minister David Cameron to set up a special inquiry into child abuse. Lady Castle put together 30 pages of information about alleged attempts by the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) to infiltrate government while seeking funding and trying to persuade MPs to legalise sex  with children. As well as key members of both the Commons and Lords, she found that about 30 prominent businessmen, public school teachers, scoutmasters and police officers had links to PIE. Yesterday Mr Hale, 61, said: ‘Barbara was horrified at the rapid extent of PIE’s involvement with key people and her file included details of about 16 household-name MPs.’ He said Lady Castle – who at the time was Euro MP Barbara Castle – passed him the dossier and asked if he would write a story based on it. ‘I agreed to run something the following week but obviously had to contact certain MPs named – from the Labour, Liberal and Conservative parties – and the Home Office for their responses,’   said Mr Hale. ‘The next day, Cyril Smith came to my office. He must have heard about it, or been sent by, the former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe. ‘Cyril tried to persuade me that it was “all poppycock”. He said Barbara had her “knickers in a twist” since leaving the House and had become bored with wine lakes and sugar mountains in Europe. ‘He played down the whole episode and wanted an assurance that I wouldn’t run anything. ‘I couldn’t give that and he went away very disappointed. The next day the heavy mob arrived. Two or three police in uniform and half a dozen in plain clothes. Bully: Paedophile Cyril Smith is said to have asked an editor to bury the story . ‘They came at 8am, before most people had arrived for work, and showed me warrant cards and a D-notice and something signed by a judge. They threatened me with five to ten years in prison and took away my notebooks and all the papers Barbara had given me. ‘It was a threat to national security, and not in the public interest, they told me. If I had said no, I would have been arrested. I had to give them assurances I had given them everything. They told me not to tell anyone, and the whole thing was over within half an hour.’ Mr Hale went on to be a campaigning editor at the Matlock Mercury newspaper known for his investigation that led to the freeing of Stephen Downing, wrongly jailed for the ‘Bakewell Tart’ murder. But he said it was the incident with the Lady Castle dossier that sparked his determination to expose cover-ups. He said: ‘Barbara had been a long-serving local MP and used to come and have a chat with me every couple of weeks. We had talked about a potential paedophile ring with MPs before, but she said no one would listen. Detective Clive Driscoll has told how he was removed from a probe into a council-run children's home in the late 1990s . ‘She asked me if I would take a look and run a story from her point of view. She objected to any funding of this organisation PIE, and was very concerned about the speed of their infiltration and the number of prominent names who were allegedly supporting them. ‘Barbara was horrified, too, at the prospect of Parliament approving legalised sex with children, often under the guise of educating them, and mentioned an influx of rent boys and unsavoury and unfortunate situations that had been covered up by the authorities.’ He said she had not been surprised when he told her about the visit from Special Branch. ‘She sort of expected it,’ he said. ‘This was a powerful organisation and she reluctantly admitted she was fighting a formidable foe. She apologised for the hassle it caused me.’ Lady Castle died in 2002. Mr Hale said of the dossier: ‘It was 30 years ago, so I can’t remember the names and full details, but I was sworn to secrecy by Special Branch at the risk of jail if I repeated any of  the allegations.’","Paedophile dossier naming VIP figures was drawn up by Barbara Castle .

"Alderman Antonio French said he does not believe Wilson's story of what happened in Ferguson that night in August when Michael Brown was shot dead . Former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson was 'remorseless, cold,' in his account of how he shot and killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in August, a St Louis politician has claimed. Alderman Antonio French said he does not believe Wilson's story of what happened in Ferguson that night, telling ABC News that 'frankly a lot of his answers sounded like they were prepared by a lawyer'. He went on to say that the community has not been given the closure or resolve it needs to move forward, and instead the grand jury process has just created more anger. On Sunday, Darren Wilson's lawyer revealed that the police officer had chosen to resign without severance pay after being made aware of threats that his fellow officers would be harmed if he stayed in the force. But French believes that many more resignations are needed in order for the community to begin healing, and has called for police chief Thomas Jackson to stand down. 'It's impossible for this community to move forward with him still in that role,' he said. 'Frankly, the thing we haven't seen is a lot of government accountability,' French added. 'Not many people have taken responsibility for what's happened, and people are still waiting for answers and change.' French had his office torched during the first night of unrest sparked by the grand jury decision not to indict Wilson for the killing of Michael Brown. Within 30 minutes of the decision being announced that Monday night, Ferguson had erupted in an orgy of violence, arson, random gunfire and pitched battles, with heavily armed riot police unable to cope with the scale of the mayhem. By Tuesday, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon had sent more than 2,200 National Guard members to the Ferguson area to support local law enforcement. At the time, French took to Twitter to express his frustration over Nixon's state of emergency declaration. Scroll down for video . French said former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson (left) was 'remorseless, cold' in his account of how he shot and killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown (right) in August . 'The National Guard is called in when policing has failed, he wrote. 'Military presence in my city will mark a historic failure on the part of (government).' 'This is not a war. There is no military solution.' French told ABC that for the county prosecutor to release the grand jury decision at night and for the governor to call in the National Guard but not deploy them to West Florissant, 'it really showed a failure to grasp the situation and to handle it on the part of government'. 'It really hurts our hearts,' he added. 'We've gone through a tough week here, but we knew that a lot of people were very angry and we knew a lot of people were coming from other places.

"Could chilly fertility pants help you conceive a child? Plenty of things are better when served chilled: white wine, ice cream, gazpacho, testicles... pardon? Strange as it may sound, for men who are trying to conceive a baby the ideal environment in which to store their little swimmers is one cooled to a temperature slightly below core body heat. So now one forward-thinking Morocco-based man (who has suffered fertility problems of his own) has invented a pair of men's underpants that keep things downstairs chilly in order to maximise the chances of conceiving. American Josh Shoemake's patented 'Snowballs' pants come with a special integrated pocket that cools a man's nether regions in effort to boost his sperm count. Shoemake, 38, a full-time writer who was headmaster of The American School of Tangier for 5 years, himself spent lots of money and suffered endless heartache going through the 'fertility factory' with his wife. Originally from Virginia, Shoemake came up with the idea for Snowballs after a friend of his was told by a doctor to cool his genitals in order to help him conceive a baby. On his Kickstarter webpage - through which he is attempting to net US$20,000 (£13,361) of funding before 4 April in order to produce and market the underpants - Shoemake explains how he and his friend became obsessed with the idea of how heat affects male fertility. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Snowballs packages come with three pairs of underpants, three special 'cooling' gel packs and a 'Gentleman's Guide to Cooling' Snowballs underwear comes with a specially integrated pocket to cool a man's nether regions . He says: 'It was my friend and his wife who really provided the breakthrough. It had been a painful year. There had been a silent miscarriage after . two years of trying, and the best doctor that money could buy had said . that their chances were now zero.' Shoemake continues: 'They ignored his advice and saw . another doctor, and then another, until finally one gynecologist took . the time to sit down with them and listen carefully. 'Almost immediately, . he had a new plan. First, my friend should begin icing his balls. Huh? And then he should have himself tested for a varicocele. Again, huh?' The cooling gel packs that slip inside the Snowballs' special pocket to chill a man's testicles . Josh Shoemake, left, has created Snowballs underpants, to optimise a man's chances of conceiving . Varicoceles are enlarged veins in the scrotum that bring more . blood and raise scrotal temperatures. When Shoemake's friend began icing his testicles, he and his wife conceived a daughter. Speaking to MailOnline, Shoemake said: The studies showing that icing works are pretty recent, and we're just starting out, but there is no doubt that heat kills sperm, and that icing prevents that. 'I imagine we'll have some additional testimonials pretty soon, but in fertility science, like in most science, it's difficult to isolate any one factor.

"Esther Rantzen has spoken of her revulsion after learning that a former lover has been linked to the child abuse scandal threatening to engulf Westminster. The broadcaster and Childline founder had an affair with politician Sir Nicholas Fairbairn after they met at a BBC studio in 1966. But Ms Rantzen has now distanced herself from the late Conservative MP and Solicitor General for Scotland – who died in 1995, aged 61. Disgusted: Esther Rantzen with youngsters at a Childline event . Evidence has come to light suggesting he may have visited a London guest house where children from care homes were allegedly assaulted by high-profile visitors. Miss Rantzen, 74, played a leading role in uncovering child abuse during the 1980s. She said: ‘I am horrified and disgusted by these allegations because Nicky was a friend of mine. ‘I had a very brief relationship with him. I always assumed that he was attracted to adult women rather than children. ‘I had absolutely no knowledge of that side of him. However, over the years I have learned that you really never know anyone.’ The former That’s Life presenter was 26 when she embarked on an affair with the married MP after he appeared as a guest on a BBC show where she was a researcher. She said: ‘When I knew Nicky he was courteous, charming and very fond of women. ‘He was a high-profile lawyer, who lived in a castle and had a very flamboyant private life.’ ‘He took me to lunch at the Ritz. He gave me a long-stemmed red rose and ordered Beluga caviar and Krug champagne. Ex-lover: Sir Nicholas Fairbairn had links to paedophile politicians . ‘If ever there was an aphrodisiac meal that was it. Nicky took to me to some Lord’s house where he was staying and the rest was inevitable.’ The presenter, who founded the world’s first child abuse hotline, Childline, in 1986, was appalled by the emergence of evidence which suggests that a powerful network of paedophiles may once have stalked the corridors of power. She said: ‘It is really important that the people who have suffered now recognise that they do have a right to justice. It is not about the culture of the time. ‘Child abuse has always been a crime and, in my experience, there was never a time when it was tolerated. What happened with Cyril Smith was horrific. The whole thing was hushed up and police were taken off cases and prevented from going public with what they knew. ‘It was straightforward, old-fashioned conspiracy.’ Lists of VIP visitors to the Elm Guest House – which hosted parties in the 1980s where vulnerable boys were sexually assaulted after being plied with alcohol – are now being used by police as evidence in their Operation Fernbridge inquiry. The documents, seen by the Mail on Sunday, state that politicians including ‘N Fairburn’ and ‘C Smith’ visited the property on June 7, 1982. They also state that ‘Fairburn’ had ‘used boys in sauna’ and that photos had been taken of him – as well as Cyril Smith – at the guest house. Police have confirmed that Smith, the late Liberal MP for Rochdale, who has since been exposed as a serial abuser, was a regular visitor to the address. Despite the spelling discrepancy there have now been calls for a full investigation which would establish whether Fairbairn was involved. Sir Nicholas, who carried a brace of pistols on his hip and designed his own flamboyant tartan attire, was forced to resign as Solicitor General in 1982 over a decision not to prosecute in a rape case. Baroness Butler-Sloss, pictured, feels 'hurt and sadness' over resignation . By Martin Delgado . Baroness Butler-Sloss, chosen to chair the inquiry into historic child abuse, has spoken of her ‘hurt’ at having to resign before she could even take up the role. The resignation last week came after claims the retired judge’s late brother, Sir Michael Havers, who was Attorney-General and later Lord Chancellor, was involved in a cover-up. ‘I didn’t want to resign but I had to. 'The victims didn’t have faith in me,’ she said. ‘Now all  I feel is hurt and sadness. 'I discussed it with loved ones before making my decision, but nobody influenced or pushed me. It’s a pity. 'Yes, it hurt me.’ The peer was speaking at London’s Piccadilly Theatre at the Jack Petchey Foundation’s Speak Out Challenge. Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘She seems to be drawing attention to her own self-pity. Many victims of abuse will find her remarks insensitive.’ The previous year a House of Commons secretary had tried to hang herself from a lamp-post outside his London flat after they had an affair. In Who’s Who Sir Nicholas described his pastimes as: ‘Making love, ends meet and people laugh.’ In 2000 the daughter of a prominent Scottish lawyer, who was never  publicly named, alleged Sir Nicholas had been part of a paedophile ring. At the time the claims were angrily rejected by his family. Sir Nicholas’ eldest daughter Charlotte declined to comment on the latest allegations, stating: ‘There’s nothing I can say. He’s been dead for 20 years.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Esther Rantzen had affair with politician Sir Nicholas Fairbairn in the 1960s .

"British intelligence on Syrian troop movements is helping rebels in their fight against President Bashar al-Assad's regime, it was revealed today. The disclosure by a Syrian opposition official is the first indication of British intelligence playing a covert role in the civil war. The official told The Sunday Times the British authorities 'know about and approve 100 per cent' signals intelligence from their Cyprus bases being passed through Turkey to the rebel troops of the Free Syrian Army. The Free Syrian Army fighters have been aided by British intelligence in their fight again President Bashar al-Assad's regime, it was claimed . 'British intelligence is observing things closely from Cyprus. It's very useful because they find out a great deal,' the official said. 'The British are giving the information to the Turks and the Americans and we are getting it from the Turks.' According to the official, the most valuable intelligence so far has been about the movements of troops loyal to President Assad towards the stricken second city of Aleppo, which is partly controlled by rebels. Early this month FSA fighters had reported that two large columns of government troops were heading towards Aleppo. One was from Latakia on the Mediterranean coast and the other from Damascus, the capital. The fighters did not reveal the source of their intelligence at the time. The official said rebels ambushed troops and a column of more than 40 tanks in a valley near Saraqib, cut them off and destroyed many of them with repeat attacks with rocket-propelled grenades. Smoke rises over the Salaheddine neighbourhood in central Aleppo during clashes between Free Syrian Army fighters and Syrian Army soldiers yesterday . Civil war: Smoke billowing from the scene of a bomb explosion in central Damascus . Britain has two sovereign military bases in Cyprus at Dhekelia and Akrotiri. They draw intelligence from the airwaves for GCHQ, Britain's listening post in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. The opposition official said rebel forces in Aleppo had also received US satellite imagery, which the Turks had passed on from the CIA. MI6 and the CIA are understood to be tacitly condoning the supply of heavy machineguns from Gulf countries to the rebels. The rebels claim to have shot down at least two helicopters, part of a fleet used by Assad's regime to try and crush the growing rebellion. But they do not have enough to be effective. One diplomat denied that the British were 'facilitating' the supply of heavy machineguns. But he said he could not rule out the possibility that private contractors financed by countries such as Qatar were involved in providing arms. Wealthy families in Qatar and Saudi Arabia are understood to be providing substantial financial support to the rebel forces. Opposition fighters also benefit from the monitoring by British bases of ships along the Syrian coast from countries friendly towards Assad. Britain has officially ruled out giving any covert help to the rebels. It is understood that William Hague, the foreign secretary, has been advised that it would be illegal under international law for Britain to supply weapons directly to any group in Syria, which is covered by a European Union arms embargo.","Disclosure is first indication of Britain playing a .

"The Canadian father who was forced to choose which of his 3-year-old twin daughters to give a life-saving liver transplant to is recovering a week after surgery. Michael Wagner's two youngest daughters Phuoc and Binh, adopted from Vietnam,  both suffer from Alagille syndrome which is slowly causing their livers to fail. When Mr Wagner and his wife Johanne found out that both girls would need a liver transplant, they were relieved to find out that he was a perfect match. However, he was only able to give a portion of his liver to just one of his daughters, leaving him with an impossible choice. In the end, doctors suggested giving the donation to daughter Phuoc, since she needed it the most. Scroll down for video . Happy reunions: Michael Wagner donated part of his liver to his adopted daughter Phuoc on February 10. The two are pictured above reuniting five days after the operation . Impossible choice: Phuoc (right) and twin sister Binh (left) both suffer from the same condition that is slowly causing their liver to fail. Mr Wagner was a match for both of the girls, but could only choose one to donate to. Phuoc was chosen because her medical need was more dire. The girls pictured above with adoptive mother Johanne . Mr Wagner and daughter Phuoc went into surgery on February 10, and it has so far been a success. Five days after the operation, the family posted a heartwarming video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in Phuoc's hospital room. 'Hey mon belle!' Mr Wagner says to his little girl, which translates to 'Hey my beauty' in French. He then moves to side of Phuoc's bed and kisses her on the head and asks how she fells in French, as the two share a tender father-daughter moment. Mrs Wagner posted pictures of the reunion as well, and updated supporters on her husband and daughter's recovery, as well as their continued search to find a donor for Binh. 'So hard to believe we are hitting the one week mark: it seems like a blurr,' Mrs Wagner wrote on Facebook. 'Michael still in hospital, Phuoc still on morphine, and mommy holding on on coffee. Still a fair amount of discomfort for Michael but he managed to visit his little girl two days in a row.' The social media effort to find another donor has apparently been successful according to a spokesman for the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. The hospital last week received 400 submissions from people offering to be a donor for Binh and they hope to find a donor from that pool within the next few days to weeks. Ailing: Binh and Phuoc Wagner (pictured) both suffer from the genetic disorder Alagille syndrome. The family is still looking for a donor for Binh . In the run-up to the surgery, Mr Wagner said it's been hard for him to accept that he could only help one of his girls. 'The cruel part of the liver is that you can only do it once,' he told the site Yahoo Canada. The Wagners said the girls’ doctor was the one who ultimately decided that Phuoc would get her father’s liver based on medical necessity. Gary Levy, who runs the liver donor program at the Toronto General Hospital, told The Canadian Press vial Global News that donors can give up to 70 per cent of their liver, which will regrow to its full size, but it can only be done once. Nervous but excited: 3-year-old Phuoc is pictured smiling here right before her surgery last week . Recovery: Phuoc was listed in fair condition in the intensive care unit at SickKids hospital right after the operation . The Wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phouc in. Mrs Wagner said: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really. 'They were 9 pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.' Despite the health problems, Mrs Wagner does not regret her decision. She said: 'We look back and we have no regrets. 'We would travel this path all over again. They have taught us openness, they have taught our children sharing and openness. It's been nothing but a wonderful mess.' Heart-wrenching choice: The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto has received 400 submissions from people wanting to be donors for Binh. They hope to narrow down the list to a match for the girl in the coming days and weeks .

"Damning: BBC staff turned a blind eye to up to 1,000 allegations of child rape and sexual assault by Jimmy Savile, according to a review published next month . BBC staff disregarded up to 1,000 allegations of child rape and sexual assault on the corporation's premises by predatory DJ Jimmy Savile, according to a damning review published next month. The inquiry, led by Dame Janet Smith, will also claim that the true number of Savile's victims may never be known and that BBC executives were aware of the allegations, but consistently failed to take any action against the late Top Of The Pops presenter. While due for publication this month, Smith's report has been delayed until February due to the large number of victim testimonies being examined. An unnamed source close to the inquiry told The Observer that the report's conclusions will overshadow the investigation led by Nick Pollard, former head of Sky News, which sought to uncover why the BBC dropped its Newsnight programme on the Savile allegations. The source said: 'It will go right to the heart of how Savile was able to get away with the most heinous of crimes under the very noses of BBC staff for more than 40 years.' Smith, a former court of appeal judge, will also highlight the sheer scale of BBC employees who knew about Savile's behaviour, as well as his colleague, Stuart Hall, but remained silent. Peter Saunders, chief executive of . the National Association for People Abused in Childhood described the potential . findings in Smith's report as 'very sad'. He said: 'You think, 'Oh my God, these people were offending almost in open sight and no-one thought to intervene.' Liz Dux, a lawyer from Slater & Gordon, who is representing 74 of Savile's victims, added: 'This will not be a what-the-BBC-want sort of report.' Smith, who led the inquiry into GP and serial killer Harold Shipman, is reported to have sent letters to every member of BBC staff past and present asking for witnesses to Savile's crimes. More than 1,000 victims and witnesses, including 138 who are pursuing civil claims for compensation, have also been helping the inquiry. Prolific: Police say Savile attacked more than 1,000 victims over 54 years, including at the age of 84 on the last ever Top of the Pops . Police investigations have so far uncovered that at least 450 people were abused by the Jim'll Fix It presenter on BBC premises. They also say at least 1,300 people were attacked by him over the course of 54 years. Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, is said to have carried out most of the attacks in the 1960s and 1970s, when his popularity as a BBC presenter was at its peak. However, aged 79 he groped a teenage girl while filming the last Top of the Pops. Described as Britain's worst ever paedophile, Savile's abuse also took place on NHS premises, prompting a further review expected later this year. Abuse of trust: Savile with patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, which is also investigating claims of sexual assault . Over the years, Savile used his high-profile position to abuse patients at hospitals across the country, including Broadmoor, at which he had an office and living quarters and Leeds General Infirmary, where he was given widespread access. In a 2009 interview with police, Savile even boasted that he ‘owned’ the NHS hospital at Stoke Mandeville and said he brushed off girls ‘like midges’. Limited compensation will be available to Savile's victims through a scheme being agreed by the BBC, the NHS and the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust. However, Dux hopes the BBC will increase the compensation available to his victims once Smith's findings are published.

"As a billionaire playboy, Teddy Sagi revels in his reputation as one of Britain’s most ­eligible and wealthy bachelors. He can certainly boast of ­having had romances with some of the most beautiful women in the world. But what the businessman — who has a ­sprawling home in Knightsbridge — should ­perhaps be less proud of is that he made much of his vast fortune by exploiting the poorest and most ­vulnerable people in the country. Today, a Mail investigation can reveal that he is the king of the fixed-odds betting terminals that have brought such misery to so many — the so-called crack cocaine of the gambling world. Sagi’s company, Playtech, is behind the ­majority of software used by High Street ­bookmakers where people, often from the most deprived areas, pump billions of pounds a year into the machines. Supermodel and the gambling king: Bar Refaeli with Teddy Sagi . Ladbrokes alone took £1 billion on the terminals in just one month as punters addicted to the ‘games’ — which typically ­simulate roulette — wagered up to £100 every 20 seconds on a single spin. As the Mail revealed yesterday, a new poll shows nearly half of all voters believe the terminals should be banned, while 73 per cent want the maximum bet of £100 dramatically reduced. This pernicious presence in ­hundreds of High Streets is a direct result of Labour relaxing gambling regulations in 2001, which opened the floodgates for ­digital roulette games to be played in betting shops. Since then the number of fixed-odds machines has rocketed to 33,000 — with Playtech providing the technology for more than 20,000 of them. They have been blamed for an increase in problem gambling, and are said to have an almost hypnotic effect that leaves players like ‘zombies’. Roger Radler, from Marlow, ­Buckinghamshire, blames his addiction to these machines for him losing his six-figure salary job as a business development manager in London, as well as the collapse of his marriage. He ended up amassing £60,000 of debts, which he kept secret from his wife. At one point he was sleeping on a park bench. ‘You can try for a new “high” every 20 seconds, but then you find you are losing huge sums of money,’ he says. ‘At its worst, I probably lost a month’s salary in a couple of hours. It was horrendous.’ This, then, can be the human cost of the betting machines — yet still Teddy Sagi’s company Playtech ­unashamedly states its software can help book­makers ‘manage your players ­throughout the player’s life-cycle’, describing how a gambler can play on a machine in a betting shop, and then ‘when he is ready to move on, he can continue the game on his smartphone and tablet device in the comfort of his own home’. While it is bad enough that Sagi has helped turn Britain into a nation of gamblers, even more ­disturbing is the fact that he learned some of the tricks of his controversial trade from the world of internet pornography. A fixed odds betting terminal, which are often found in High Street bookmakers . Not only that, I have established he is a convicted criminal who comes from a family with a murderous past. Born in Tel Aviv in 1972, Sagi became accustomed to the finer things in life. His father ran a travel agency and his parents appeared in newspaper ­gossip columns. But he and his ­family were to find far greater notoriety for their criminal activities. In 1983, Sagi’s older stepbrother, Ronen, was convicted of the ­murder of an investment consultant. There was little doubt about his guilt — he stole his father’s gun, fitted a silencer and fired ten bullets at his victim after a disagreement believed to be about money. Then in 1994, when Teddy Sagi was just 22, he was arrested along with seven other businessmen on suspicion of insider trading. They were charged with buying and then manipulating the value of stock in a widespread banking fraud. Sagi, one of the youngest among those arrested, admitted grave deceit, bribery and insider trading. He was jailed for nine months. When he was released, he became hellbent on making his fortune. He teamed up with his father trading on the stock market and buying and selling property. But he realised the internet was the means to make large sums, regardless of the ­morality of how the money is made. As he said in one of his few public statements, ‘sex and betting are the most profitable businesses on the internet’. Sagi invested in companies building pornographic websites. He was also eager to seek out those at the forefront of developing software. In 1999, he invested in a company called Unlimited9, which was involved in setting up ­pornographic sites. That same year, he launched Playtech in a bid to become the ­biggest online gambling ­software developer. He sought out the brightest mathematicians and ­specialists who could develop games that would maximise profits. Just seven years later, the ­company was valued at £550 million when it floated on the London Stock Exchange. Still in his early 30s, Sagi had joined the ranks of the world’s super-rich. Ladbrokes alone took £1billion on betting terminals in just one month (file picture) Since then, the company has gone from strength to strength — two years ago its share price was 312p, but by last month it had soared to 814p. Sagi announced recently that he will sell a 15.4 per cent stake in his company, giving him a payout  of £326 million. Today, he is estimated to be worth more than £1 billion, much of it from his licensing deals for ­gambling software with the likes of William Hill and Ladbrokes. While Sagi does not directly take a cut from gamblers pumping money into the betting machines, he is believed to have considerable financial interests in a number of High Street bookmakers. He certainly knows the importance of ­hiring the best computer geeks to develop his software. Crucially, fixed-odds betting ­terminals are said to be addictive because they tempt the player back with just the right level of rewards. While a gambler may start off ­winning, the odds are likely to be against him in the long term. Also, if someone goes to a casino to play roulette, a single bet can take a few minutes to complete: on a ­roulette game in a High Street ­bookies, it’s over in just 20 seconds. Professor Natasha Dow Schull, a specialist in the way technology is being harnessed by gambling firms, believes the machines made by the likes of Sagi are ‘odious’ and should be banned. Sagi was photographed arm in arm with supermodel Bar Refaeli, pictured in 2009 . ‘The software in these machines taps into a fundamental part of human psychology, exploiting ­people for maximum profit,’ says the American academic and author of a book called Addiction By Design. ‘Essentially, people playing them are being manipulated by mathematicians who have worked out how to up the ante and keep you gambling, with just the right level of reward-to-risk ratio. ‘Sophisticated digital technology and ­mathematics are used to match the way the human brain and our ­psychology work. It makes people addicts.’ Labour MP Tom Watson says: ‘These machines have turned every High Street into a digital casino. They are a menace to communities up and down the country.’ While fixed-odds betting ­terminals have brought financial havoc to many lives, Teddy Sagi has lived high on the profits of his enterprises. Unlike the users of his games, Sagi has received excellent returns on his penchant for risk. ­According to one Israeli newspaper, he ‘likes risk as much as he likes the good life’. Pressure has increased on the Government to take some kind of action to curb the use of betting terminals (file picture) As well as that luxury home in Central London, he has properties in Cyprus, Berlin, Israel and the U.S., and recently splashed out on a Bombardier luxury private jet. When I visited his home in Knightsbridge this week to request an interview, I was told by security staff at the heavily guarded ­complex that Sagi was a ‘very busy and very ­private man’ and was probably away. He did not respond to a letter inviting him to talk to me, nor did his public relations ­representatives return my calls. But he has not been quite so shy when it has come to pursuing some of the world’s most beautiful women. In 2009, he made gossip columns around the world when he was ­photographed arm in arm with the Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli, who had just split up with the Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio. That same year, the couple posed for photographs at an after-show party when he took her to Berlin to watch a concert by Britney Spears. There were also rumours that he was dating Esti Ginzburg, a model who has regularly appeared in a swimsuit in Sports Illustrated  magazine. He had a child, now eight, with a former beauty queen, and is now seeing a former Miss Israel, with whom he’s had a ­second child. But the couple have not ­married and Sagi still gets listed in the media as one of the most ­eligible bachelors around. According to one associate, he revels in his wealth. ‘He likes to have fun. He likes the good life. He takes long holidays and likes to spend his leisure time ­watching football or films. He enjoys playing the piano and ping pong.’ Recently, Sagi raised his profile further in Britain with the purchase of London’s iconic Camden Market for £400 million. Whether gambling machines will continue to be such a cash cow for him remains to be seen, as pressure increases on the Government to take some kind of action to curb their use. But then, thanks to gambling, Teddy Sagi has already played the odds — and is a very big winner indeed.","Mail investigation reveals Teddy Sagi is king of fixed-odds betting terminals .

"Nine West millionaire Vince Camuto and his former beauty queen wife Louise have listed their historic Water Mill, New York estate for $49.5 million. The 21,000 square-foot pile sits on 7.6 acres of prime waterfront land complete with manicured gardens, a tennis court and a 68-foot-long pool. The opulent mansion has luxurious features including a climate-controlled wine cellar, elevators and a 60-foot-long salon that used to be the grand ballroom. That's a lot of shoes: Nine West founder Vince Camuto is selling this stunning Hamptons mansion for $49.5 million . Passion for property: The Camutos love restoring historic properties to their former glory . The house was originally bought by . shipyard magnate Edward P. Morse in the late 1910s. Following a few very . successful years, Morse and his wife expanded the property to its . current proportions, but sold just a decade later. The Camutos bought the manor in 2005 from Catholic nuns who had possessed it for 70 years, dubbing the house Villa Maria and using it variously as a school, retirement home and monastery. When the Camutos acquired the property, its once-luxurious rooms had been divided into dormitories and practical additions such as aluminum-frame windows and asphalt roof tiles as well as extensive water damage had turned its once-sumptuous facade into a shadow of its former self. The Camutos saw the property's potential, though, and committed themselves to returning the manor to its Jazz Age glory.'There was something magical about the place. Though the nuns couldn’t afford the upkeep or the taxes, they wanted a buyer who would take care of it,' Camuto told Architectural Digest.Camuto, who launched Nine West in the 1970s, is now CEO of the Camuto Group and runs the company with his wife Louise, a former Miss Sweden and interior designer. The couple told the sisters they wanted to restore the property, 'no matter how long it took.' Salon: What was once the grand ballroom has become a living area with three different seating areas breaking up the 60-foot-long space . Despite its palatial proportions, the house has managed to retain the character of a beach house - light, airy and relaxed. The couple called in archtect Andre Tchelistcheff, whose four-year restoration involved modernizing the house but 'without touch screens everywhere.' The result is elegant simplicity that draws attention to the elegant architecture and stunning natural light that pours through the windows and reflects on the muted, mostly white palatte. Despite having a 60-foot long living room, a dining room as well as a breakfast room and a master bathroom with a custom-made marble bathtub, Tchelistcheff says the house isn't over-the-top. 'What’s interesting about Villa Maria is that although it’s big, it feels summery, not ostentatious,” he told Architectural Digest. The incredible a architectural features include the three-storey wrought-iron spiral staircase with a custom-designed chandelier from Mecox and faux-limestone walls painted by a decorative artist. Sweeping stairs: The staircase spirals up three floors with a custom-made chandelier hanging through its center . A floor to ceiling marble fireplace dominates the 1,682 grand salon (also known as living room) which is divided into three separate seating areas  According to Architectural Digest, the kitchen is painted in a Benjamin Moore white, features custom-made holophane lights by Ann-Morris Antiques and cabinetry by Eppley Building & Design; the oak bench and ebonized bobbin chair are antique. The library has a domed atrium with abundant greenery adding a further sense of calm, perfect for quiet contemplation. A solarium connects a family room with heated limestone floors to an adjacent carriage house. Lap it up: The 68-foot-long pool is perfect for laps and the sun-loungers provide for those who prefer to laze away sunny afternoons . Second to nun: The incredible property was inhabited by Catholic nuns who used it for various purposes for 70 years before the Camutos bought it in 2005 . 'Vince and Louise wanted to keep the atmosphere light and comfortable because it’s a beach house,' Carol Egan, a Manhattan interior designer who worked closely with the Camutos once the architectural phase of the restoration was complete, said. The home's grounds and outdoor areas are no less magnificent than its interior. The deep-green lawn stretches for acres, punctuated by a 68-foot pool and a full-sized tennis court. Landscape architect Edmund D. Hollander designed the gardens to be lush and abundant but not over-manicured. From any of the house's patios, panoramic views extend over the Mill Creek and Mecox Bay. The Camutos, who bought the home for $35 million, are reportedly selling Villa Maria in order to take on a new restoration project.","Nine West found Vince Camuto and his wife Louise bought the property in 2005 for $35 million .

"Vienna's State Opera Ball is noted in high society for its host's exquisite taste that captivates his guests. But it wasn't a dazzling gown, a spellbinding symphony, or even a tasty hors d'oeuvre that captivated attendees of the extravaganza last night ... but a full-blown punch up between two tie-and-tailed classical music enthusiasts. The brawl's most talked about moment came when one of the pugilists managed to swing a punishing hook with his right hand without spilling a drop of champagne from the glass in his left. His older opponent countered with a right but was unable to prevent the blow from landing squarely on his jaw, leaving a nasty gash on his chin. The altercation rather took the gloss off what was meant to be Kim Kardashian's night, who was allegedly paid $500,000 by an 83-year-old billionaire to be his date for the evening. Fortunately, though, the reality TV star was out of the room when the rough and tumble commenced, but she stormed out of the party anyway after an usher reportedly insulted her fiance, Kanye West.

"To get my bearings on my first ever trip to the island of Mallorca, a helicopter ride seemed like the perfect idea. From my vantage point hundreds of feet in the air, I could see all the way from the mountains to the beaches, taking in sheer cliffs and sparkling bays and everything from vineyards and golf courses to swimming pools, marinas and millionaire’s mansions. Mallorca, the largest of the Balearic islands, is spectacular from the air . There was Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones’ house, round the next cliff was the £30 million Mallorcan castle where Princess Diana reportedly stayed and just below me… . ‘That’s Magaluf,’ says Jonny, my pilot and guide for the morning. ‘Down there.’ I peer down past my feet to what looks like just a few streets running parallel to a beach, with high-rise hotels and a few swimming pools visible from the air. ‘That’s it?’ I said. ‘That’s what all the fuss is about?’ Jonny laughed. ‘That’s why it’s good to come up here,’ he said. ‘It’s just tiny compared to the rest of the island.’ The high-rises of Magaluf seemed pretty small from my vantage point in the skies . While Magaluf seems to have the lion’s share of press coverage, there is certainly a lot more to the island than the infamous area known mainly for binge-drinking, sex-crazy Brits on their holidays. Locals I spoke to during my week either despaired of the bad press – ‘People think the whole of Mallorca is like Magaluf,’ moaned one – or were relieved that the rest of the island was left unspoilt. Many people had never even been there, even if they had lived on Mallorca for years. ‘Why would I, when there are so many much nicer places to see in Mallorca?’ said another. The tiny hillside village of Deia is one of the island's prettiest and home to Lord Lloyd-Weber . After a week exploring the island, I could agree. At 62 miles across and 44 miles wide it is the largest of the Balearic islands and much bigger than I had expected. My first port of call was the beach resort of Paguera, just 25 minutes from the main airport at Palma, where friends had booked their children in for a week at the Tennis Academy there. Paguera is one of the closest beaches to the capital, Palma, and popular with tourists . While not the most glamorous town on the island, Paguera was actually rather nice – a pleasant main street and three sandy beaches flanked by a good choice of restaurants – and the island’s most famous son Rafael Nadal was even rumoured to have been seen at the tennis club much to great excitement. Just minutes away is the stunning marina at Port d’Andratx. Having seen Mallorca from the air, it was time to see the island from the sea, so I went out for the day on a 52-ft Riva Rivale boat with Lorenzo and Francisco Vila, two brothers who charter luxury yachts for wealthy holidaymakers. Feeling right at home - on a £1.5 million luxury yacht which is often chartered by royalty . At £2,400 a day to hire, it’s not cheap but drinking wine on a £1.5 million boat in your own private bay certainly made me feel like royalty, which was fitting as the Vilas' customer the following day was a member of the Saudi royal family. For lunch we moored the yacht and we dined on sushi and seafood at the popular Gran Folies beach club. Diners were shipped in on dinghies and could keep an eye on their luxury cruisers as they enjoyed a lengthy lunch overlooking the sea. Back on dry land it was time to top up my tan at Mood Beach club, where I spent the day being served cocktails at one of its huge poolside beds, and then off to check out yet more yachts at the posh expat neighbourhood of Portals Nous. Clubs such as Mood Beach (pictured) are where people top up their tans and then dance the night away . The capital Palma was yet another unexpected delight – behind the spectacular cathedral and riverside open-air cinema was a wonderful network of tiny streets where locals and holidaymakers alike ambled past people drinking in an array of delightful cafes, enjoying evening cocktails and listening to the sounds of jazz floating through the streets. It was a surprise to find that my hotel which was surrounded by lush green golf courses wherever you looked (I was content to lounge by its beautiful pools) was just a few minutes from the centre of Palma. Golfing is very popular in Mallorca and my hotel, just minutes from Palma, was surrounded by golf courses . Reverting to the more traditional transport of a hire car to explore the rest of the island I headed east to the seaside towns of Cala d’Or and Portopetro where I went on very different type of yacht, the 16m classic sailing boat Vita Bel II and dined out on Italian food while watching the sun set. But the real highlights of Mallorca for me were to be found up in the hills. Twisting roads took me away from Palma and the coastal resorts to the beautiful village of Valldemossa and the Port de Soller, where I had lunch at the impressive Jumeirah hotel, perched high on the cliffs so swimming in the infinity pool felt like I was swimming straight into the sky. To infinity and beyond... the clifftop pool at the Jumeirah, Port de Soller . My ultimate destination though was the picturesque village of Deia, home of Robert Graves which still attracts a creative crowd – locals include Andrew Lloyd Webber and PR guru Lynne Franks who runs women’s retreats in her amazing home overlooking the Mediterranean. Over coffee Franks, who is currently down-sizing her home but remaining in Deia, told me that she had never been to Magaluf: (‘what’s the point?’) and said that the beauty of Deia is not only the scenery but the fact that so many people’s links to it go on for years. ‘It’s not like other expats parts of the island where people stay for three years and then go home,’ she said. ‘I know people here who’ve been coming to Deia for years and now their children are bringing their own children here. But it’s very inclusive here too – everyone knows everyone else as it’s so small you bump into everyone.’ La Residencia hotel in Deia used to be owned by Richard Branson and is popular with visiting celebrities . It does strange things to time too - my two days in Deia felt like a month. I visited the wonderfully preserved Robert Graves house and sampled some of the gardeners’ homemade spirits before reeling off into the sunshine, resolving to come back and live here, writing best-selling novels and making my fortune. I explored Deia’s lovely shops, cafes and restaurants and had a wonderfully relaxing massage at Belmond La Residencia, one of the best hotels on the island with its spa and stunning views making it a celebrity favourite. The beautiful view of Deia from one of the spa treatment room at La Residencia . I practically had to be prised out of my room the following morning – it had stunning views across the valley and a four-poster bed – but I was back that evening for its 80s disco on the lawn. There I danced the night away to Wham and Duran Duran, just near where Lord Lloyd-Weber was chatting with friends, before walking along the moonlit road to the Es Moli hotel across the valley. The real world – and especially the drinking dens of Magaluf – seemed wonderfully far away.

"Cosmetic surgeon Angelica Kavouni says: ‘Wearing a bra in bed does not help protect against drooping’ (stock picture) You’ve brushed your teeth, slathered on moisturiser and taken off your slippers. Now for the nightly decision that has divided women for generations — should you remove your bra before bed or sleep in it? Everyone seems to have a different opinion and the internet is full of conflicting information. Some claim wearing a bra to bed prevents a sagging cleavage, others that it blocks vital lymph glands — and can even cause breast cancer. Many say it makes breasts perkier, and there are those who say it irritates skin. Screen legend Marilyn Monroe wore one every night and broadcaster Mariella Frostrup has sworn by doing so since Paula Yates told her not to bother with a boob job and ‘just wear a bra in bed’. But is it the mother of all old wives’ tales or can wearing a bra all night really reverse the effects of gravity? THE DROOP TEST . Whether night-time bra-wearing can stop sagging is the million-dollar question. Unfortunately, there is no scientific evidence to firmly support the theory. Cosmetic surgeon Angelica Kavouni says: ‘Wearing a bra in bed can offer comfort while sleeping but does not help protect against drooping.’ She says breast ptosis, where skin becomes saggy, can set in due to shrinkage after pregnancy, sudden weight-loss or lack of collagen caused by ageing. ‘None of these are relevant when lying down,’ she adds. ‘Wearing a bra while standing and moving can battle ptosis but the processes that cause drooping aren’t in play while supine.’ Equally, a bra is not a time machine and can’t reverse drooping. But a lack of scientific proof can’t silence the anecdotal evidence that bras do help. Natasha Harding, a fitting specialist at lingerie specialists Rigby & Peller, sees many women who are adamant wearing a bra to bed has improved their shape. ‘My personal experience is that women tend to maintain perkier breasts if they sleep in a bra,’ she says. STAYING SMOOTH . Cosmetic surgeon Angelica Kavouni says nightly bra-wearing does not stop drooping . According to cosmetic surgeon Douglas McGeorge, nightly bra-wearing may help with stretch marks. ‘Bigger breasts can drag and want to go sideways when you are lying down. This can pull the skin and contribute to stretch marks,’ he says. ‘Wearing a bra to sleep in may slow the ageing process down very slightly in this instance.’ Equally, while bras can’t help stop a wrinkly décolletage while you sleep there are specialist products that can. The Kush sleep support (£29.99, thekushcompany.com) sits between the breasts while you rest on your side, supporting their weight and reducing creases. COMFORT FACTOR . Professor Kefah Mokbel, lead breast surgeon at the London Breast Inst-itute, says: ‘I advise patients suffering from breast discomfort that wearing a bra at night can provide support and stop discomfort.’ Experts agree wearing a bra in bed, as long as it is well-fitting, may give a more comfortable night’s sleep. Those with larger breasts — size 34D and above — often find this and so do pregnant women as their breasts can increase by two sizes or more and get far heavier. It’s about feeling secure and helping you sleep. Professor Kefah Mokbel, lead breast surgeon at the London Breast Inst-itute, says: ‘I advise patients suffering from breast discomfort — usually because they have large breasts or have just had breast surgery, such as implants or a reduction — that wearing a bra at night can provide support and stop discomfort.’ Some women find camisole tops with built-in support more comfortable, avoiding the restrictive feeling of a conventional bra. There is also a range of ‘night bras’ on the market. TIGHT SPOT . Choosing a bra that’s too tight can lead to problems. ‘Wearing a constrictive bra to sleep affects the physiology of the breast. It can impair the blood flow and lymphatic drainage, which, at worst, can lead to chronic inflammation, oedema (fluid retention) and discomfort,’ warns Professor Mokbel. Lymph glands are like exit doors for waste products from the breasts, draining by-products such as oestrogen and sending them to the liver or kidneys to be broken down. If a bra strap or side panel digs in while you are asleep, you may get an unhealthy build up of fluid which can trigger swelling and painful sensitivity. KEEP COOL . Bras, especially synthetic polyester styles, can raise your temperature while you are asleep. Breasts are external organs designed to work best at a lower temperature (36 degrees celsius) than the rest of your body, which prefers to be a steady 37C. Bras, especially synthetic polyester styles, can raise your temperature while you are asleep. ‘Sleeping in your bra can raise the temperature of your breast tissue to 37 degrees or slightly more and a restrictive bra can heighten this rise even more,’ warns Professor Mokbel. ‘Though very little research has been done, there are some theories that a change in heat like this — called “chaotic cooling or warming” — may cause conditions which lead to breast cancer. This is in the same way testicular cancer has been linked to cyclists who wear restrictive clothing, such as lycra shorts, for long periods.’ To prevent any risk to yourself, pick out a correct-fitting bra that is made in soft, breathable cotton. THE RIGHT FIT . If you are going to take the plunge and buy a sleep-in bra, there are a few things to remember. The first, according to Rigby & Peller’s Natasha Harding, is to avoid the rigid underwired models. ‘Underwire can push into the chest when you lie down and cause cysts over time with rubbing. ‘Choose something soft — almost like a sports bra — but nothing overly loose or stretchy. It should give you some support.’ A third of us wear the wrong-sized bra every day, so get a professional fitting to find out your correct measurements and prevent irritation. Retailers such as Rigby & Peller and Marks & Spencer will do this for you for free through a personal consultation without any obligation to buy. Expert Natasha says women with bigger busts should pick out bras with more structure, thicker side panels and wider straps for maximum support without pinching the skin. ‘Look for at least 80 per cent cotton on the label, too, so it’s breathable and you won’t overheat,’ she says.","Marilyn Monroe wore one every night as does Mariella Frostrup .

"A top international snooker player has been diagnosed with lung cancer just months after recovering from testicular cancer. Two-time World Championship runner-up Ali Carter, from Chelmsford, Essex, will undergo a course of chemotherapy, the sport's governing body said. The 34-year-old father-of-one, who suffers from Crohn's disease, last year recovered from testicular cancer to resume his career. Diagnosed: Two-time World Championship runner-up and father-of-one Ali Carter with his partner . World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association chairman Jason Ferguson said: 'Ali is the toughest competitor I know and having spoken to him over the last few days I can assure everyone he has the fight to get through the battle ahead.' 'I know that the world will be looking forward to Ali returning to action and I am sure that all of our friends, fans and partners will join with me in wishing Ali a full recovery.' Carter had been due to play on Saturday in Gloucester, in qualifying stages for the Wuxi Classic tournament, but pulled out. He is a three-time ranking tournament winner, having landed titles at the 2009 Welsh Open, 2010 Shanghai Masters and 2013 German Masters. Battle: Snooker star Ali Carter has announced he is battling lung cancer . Tough time: Carter has previously battled with Crohn's disease and testicular cancer . Carter lost to Ronnie O'Sullivan in each of his Crucible finals, in 2008 and 2012. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer last summer but was soon back on tour, and played almost a full season, ending at the World Championship in Sheffield when he beat Xiao Guodong in the first round before bowing out to eventual winner Mark Selby in his next match. A professional since 1996, Carter is ranked 13th in the world and has been as high as number two in his career. He is also a trained pilot, going by the nickname 'The Captain'. Snooker has been touched by cancer tragedy in recent memory, with the three-time Masters champion Paul Hunter dying of a rare form of the disease in October 2006, at the age of 27.","Two-time World Championship runner-up will undergo chemotherapy .

"Actress Salma Hayek and husband Francois-Henri Pinault who are moving to London because it is 'cosmopolitan' Hollywood star Salma Hayek and her billionaire French husband are moving to Britain. François-Henri Pinault, France’s third richest man, is relocating his family to London. Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, a luxury goods group, has an estimated fortune of £9 billion. The capital has recently become a popular destination for wealthy French, who are seeking to avoid a 75 per cent supertax introduced by increasingly unpopular Socialist President François Hollande. But despite the recent exodus of millionaires from France, Ms Hayek insisted that her family were moving to London for career reasons and not for tax purposes. Mr Pinault, 51, will still contribute to the French exchequer as his company is based in Paris. Speaking about the move in an interview with The Times Magazine, the actress said: ‘I want to clarify, it’s not for tax purposes. We are still paying taxes here in France. ‘We think that London has a lot more to offer than just a better tax situation. ‘François thinks London is very cosmopolitan. I think it will be good for my career too.’ Salma Hayek and her daughter Valentina Pinault (centre), accompanied by the rest of her family.

"After an unusually long quiet period, the sun unleashed a solar flare on May 17 this year - but scientists are now puzzling over what happened on Earth. Neutron monitors all round the world lit up in response to the blast for the first time in six years, despite the fact it was an M-Class, or moderate, flare.

James Ryan, an astrophysicist at the UNH Space Science Center said, ‘This solar flare was most unimpressive and the associated CME was only slightly more energetic.

"The editor of the magazine embroiled in the scandal of feminist T-shirts being made by women paid just 62p an hour has dismissed the controversy as ‘misogynistic’. An investigation by The Mail on Sunday uncovered the shocking conditions in a factory making T-shirts bearing the slogan ‘This Is What A Feminist Looks Like’ for a campaign by the Fawcett Society backed by Elle magazine. A union leader described the factory in Mauritius as a ‘sweatshop’ after the MoS report in November revealed that employees were sleeping 16 to a room. Shocking: An investigation by The Mail on Sunday uncovered the conditions in a factory making T-shirts bearing the slogan ‘This Is What A Feminist Looks Like’ Ever since, those involved – including fashion retailer Whistles – have repeatedly refused to concede that the workers’ conditions were unacceptable or reveal the findings of their own investigation. The latest rebuttal came yesterday as Elle editor Lorraine Candy claimed, ‘This was not a sweatshop by any standard’ – despite the cramped dormitories and employees being paid below the living wage. It has also emerged that the Fawcett Society – which works for women’s rights – had reacted to the report by saying The Mail on Sunday ‘is not a friend of women’. Mrs Candy told The Times that what bothered her most about the controversy was the inference that ‘these silly women working on a magazine hadn’t done their research. Well, we had. We are not responsible for the living wage in Mauritius, but this was not a sweatshop by any standard.’ Apparently in reference to the furore over workers’ conditions, Mrs Candy added: ‘The reaction was misogynistic, but that’s what happens when you poke the bear.’ The T-shirts, which sold for £45 in Britain, had featured in Elle’s ‘feminism issue’ and were worn by Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman in the Commons, along with Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg and actors including Benedict Cumberbatch. Last night a leading union official in Mauritius reacted with fury to Mrs Candy’s comments. Jane Ragoo, who represents more than 36,000 workers, said: ‘These factory workers have the worst possible conditions. They work long hours for low wages and are exploited. ‘I invite the magazine editor to come to see this factory and find out what a sweatshop looks like. 'How would she like to sleep in a factory dormitory where you share your bedroom with 15 other people? 'It’s all very well her being given reassurances by the factory owner, but when you speak to the people who work there then you see the true extent of desperate poverty.’ Mrs Ragoo said Mrs Candy’s implication that the wages were acceptable by Mauritian standards was wrong. ‘The magazine editor is mistaken because the textile workers don’t even earn as much as the living wage. 'They earn 6,000 rupees (£120) a month, but a living wage is 14,685 rupees (£300),’ she said. Meanwhile, the Fawcett Society was criticised after the emergence of a blog posting by chairwoman Belinda Phipps that was sent to people on its mailing list. She wrote: ‘A well-intentioned project which was bringing much-needed attention to feminism from a younger audience and raising much-needed funds… then ran into trouble with The Mail on Sunday – not a friend of Fawcett or women in general. 'But, you know, when newspapers like The Mail on Sunday go for us it means we are doing our job well.’ Former vice-chairwoman of the Fawcett Society, Joanne Cash, said: ‘It is outrageous that Belinda Phipps has dismissed the investigation into female exploitation. ‘If it wasn’t for The Mail on Sunday’s exposé we wouldn’t have found out about the dire conditions these workers are facing. I wonder what the newspaper’s female readership would make of her comments?’ Last night Mrs Phipps could not be contacted for comment. In a further development, Whistles, the Fawcett Society and Elle were accused of a ‘cover-up’ over their failure to deliver on a promised investigation into the factory after three months. After the MoS first broke the story, Whistles and Elle released a joint statement to say the factory had already been ‘ethically audited’ and the women were being paid more than the minimum wage of about £87.50 a month. The audit has yet to be published. The Fawcett Society said the audit did not raise concerns about working conditions. Following the MoS report, Whistles pledged to inspect the Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile factory as ‘a matter of urgency’, but it is refusing to comment on whether it has followed up on promises to send a ‘senior member’ to Mauritius. All three have ignored repeated requests by the MoS over the past three months for an update on the investigation. Labour Behind The Label, a leading charity campaigning for textile workers’ rights, called on Whistles to be honest about the investigation. Policy co-ordinator Anna McMullen said: ‘By not being upfront and honest, Whistles is denying justice to those people working in its factory. It smacks of a cover-up.’ Asked about the accusation of a cover-up, Ms Phipps said: ‘It’s Whistles who are conducting the investigation and I’m afraid it’s them who will have to provide an update.’ Whistles spokeswoman Sadie Watts said: ‘No comment at this end for you.’ A spokeswoman for Elle said: ‘We have no further comment to make.’","Investigation revealed shocking conditions in 'feminist' T-shirts factory .

"It was a fine example of old-fashioned community spirit. But a group of volunteers who got together to rebuild a road fell foul of penpushers – who accused them of health and safety breaches and even trespassing. Residents of Niton on the Isle of Wight had been campaigning for action ever since homes were left cut off by a landslide in February. Scroll down for video . Destruction: Undercliff Drive was closed in February after a landslide wrecked the road's surface . It turned their road into a pile of rubble, and families were forced to find temporary accommodation. Eight months later nothing had been done, and with eight displaced families still desperate to get back to their homes, a group of ‘guerrilla’ volunteers from across the island decided to take matters into their own hands. Their two-day repair operation involved clearing and filling in a 40ft section of Undercliff Drive, spending £2,500 on materials. It comes after a similar scheme was hatched by Mike Watts, who built his own toll road. He spent £150,000 on the 400-yard track through a field, as the A431 between Bath and Bristol was fixed after a landslip. His local council urged drivers not to use the road, citing health and safety concerns – but they ignored the advice and more than 100,000 have now used it.

"Thomas Robert Gray holds a gun to his head as he keeps police at bay for three hours before surrendering in Pine Bluff, in 2009 . Pine Bluff in Arkansas might seem like any other struggling town in the United States. But after soaring crime rates and the economic downturn, it has been dubbed the most dangerous little town in America. Last year there were 18 murders alone in Pine Bluff, which has a population of just 49,000 - seven times the national average per capita. Two people have already been killed this year and recent figures ranked it the second most dangerous metropolitan area in America after Detroit, which has a population of 1.8million. 'To have 18 homicides is just an outrageous number for a town this size,' Police Chief Jeff Hubank told The Independent. 'The reality is, the little old white lady with the kitten on her lap is perfectly safe in this town. But if you are slinging dope on the east side, you are looking to pay with your life.' Pine Bluff was once a thriving place to live where there were plenty of jobs. It survived the great flood of 1927, the Great Depression and even the racial tensions which gripped the south during the 1960s. But now it has all the hallmarks of a town falling into disrepair and in the last 30 years as many as 16,000 people are thought to have left the area. Failing schools and poverty are all contributing to the town's high crime rates and the area is crippled with gang warfare fuelled by drug related crime. Main Street is a parade of boarded up shops and the once mighty Hotel Pines, which opened in 1913, is crumbling away. US cities and metropolitan areas by per-capita serious crime rates, as ranked by Washington-based CQ Press:1. Detroit-Livonia-Dearborn, Michigan2. Pine Bluff, Arkansas3. Flint, Michigan4. Memphis, Tennessee/ Mississippi/Arkansas5. Stockton, California6. New Orleans, Louisiana7. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina8. Little Rock, Arkansas9. Mobile, Alabama10. Jackson, Tennessee . Factories which bustled in the 1940s have now been taken over by gangs which strip them for wiring and use the money they make to buy drugs. Those who are murdered in the town are killed because they are caught up in drugs. 'Pine Bluff has just sort of faded away,' said police office, Rick Buntin. And it is not just the gang members who make themselves targets for violence. It is dangerous for police officers too. Captain Kelven Hadley, a police officer, had a gun pointed at his head in 2011 by a man who held up a petrol station. Footage caught the incident on film which showed the two men shoot each other at exactly the same time. The suspect died and Hadley survived thanks to his bullet proof vest. But for some police officers it is the danger of Pine Bluff which attracted them to join the force in the first place. Chief Hubank retired after 27 years but was called back when the town's new mayor fired his predecessor. He is now hoping to adopt a different approach to policing in a bid to cut crime rates and to make the town a place where people want to live again. Detroit topped the 2012 list of America's most dangerous cities. The Motor City is crippled with gang-related violence. Violent crimes, which include murder, rape, robbery and assault, fell 10 per cent but are still rinning five times the national average, according to Forbes magazine. Abandoned: Pine Bluff has all the hallmarks of a town falling into disrepair. Over the last 30 years as many as 16,000 people are thought to have left the area .

"The former head of BP has landed his first high profile corporate job four years after the Gulf oil spill which forced him to resign. Tony Hayward will become non-executive chairman of multinational mining and trading company Glencore Xstrata, the firm announced. It marks a remarkable comeback for the man who was at one point the most hated man in America. Former BP CEO Tony Hayward has been appointed executive chairman of mining company Greencore . In the wake of the biggest oil spill in history - which claimed 11 lives - Mr Hayward gave a speech in which he said: ‘There’s no one who wants this over more than I do. I would like my life back’. Weeks later he was photographed on a boat during Cowes Week on the Isle of Wight whilst Americans on the Gulf coast saw their livelihoods ruined by the disaster. Mr Hayward stepped down as BP chief executive soon after, in October 2010. He was called to testify before Congress and during a bumbling performance he said that he could not remember even basic details 65 times. Hayward was BP CEO when the Deepwater Horizon blew up off the Louisiana coast in April 2010 . Among his other gaffes were the prediction that the environmental impact would be ‘very modest’. He also told fellow BP executives at one point: ‘What the hell did we do to deserve this?’ The news of his new appointment was met with scepticism by some Glencore Xstrata observers including US-based Pension & Investment Research Consultants. It said in a statement: ‘There are concerns over his time as chief executive of BP arising from (the spill) and possible time commitments due to ongoing legal proceedings in the US’. Mr Hayward had previously worked on investment company Vallares and in 2011 joined Glencore PLC, one of the world’s largest commodities traders, which later merged with mining giant Xstrata to become the firm he is with now.","Former BP boss Tony Hayward was once 'the most hated man in America'

"Citigroup's chief economist was today scolded by a judge in New York for contacting his alleged stalker weeks after she was arrested for harassing him. Willem Buiter was ‘admonished' by Judge Joanne Quinones because he sent an ‘invitation to connect’ to Heleen Mees via business networking website LinkedIn. He had also contacted her on Skype just weeks before she was charged with allegedly sending him more than 3,000 sexually explicit and threatening emails and Facebook messages. The judge’s comments came as the full extent of Mees’ alleged stalking was revealed in court papers which showed she followed him to China and Amsterdam, where she used a fake name to try and get into his hotel. She also sent Mr Buiter, the chief economist at Citigroup, a message which read: ‘I hope you die (read this to your wife)’. Chic: Former New York University professor, Dutch economist, Heleen Mees, center, exits criminal court with her attorney Ira London, right, and an unidentified man, in New York on Monday August 19 . Harassment: The full extent of Mees’ alleged . stalking was revealed in court papers which showed she followed him to . China and Amsterdam, where she used a fake name to try and get into his . hotel . Citigroup economist: Willem Buiter was 'admonished' by Judge Joanne Quinones because he sent an 'invitation to connect' to Heleen Mees via business networking website LinkedIn . Mees, 44, appeared at the Manhattan Criminal Court wearing four-inch grey suede stilettos, a tight-fitting navy knee length pencil skirt and a grey top with a grey cardigan draped over her shoulders. Prosecutors say that her obsessive behavior lasted between 2009 and last month during which time she bombarded Mr Buiter, 63, with at least 164 Facebook messages, hundreds of phone calls and 68 requests to meet him for a drink in one month. Some of the emails were sexual such as a request to 'also send him naked pictures of other women'. But others were more disturbing such as a picture of some dead birds next to which she wrote: 'I hope your plane falls out the sky'. In the criminal complaint against her Mr Buiter says: ‘In May 2010, the defendant tried to meet with me at my hotel in Beijing, China, and in January 2013, the defendant tried to meet me at my hotel in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, by using a fake name. ‘On May 6, 2013, the defendant came to my apartment building in the County and State of New York, and tried to be let up to my apartment.’ Mees’ lawyer Ira London told the court that the reality was in fact very different. He said that the affair was ‘encouraged on social media and in person' as well by Cambridge-educated Mr Buiter, who was born in Holland but has British citizenship. Mr Buiter sent Mees a cease and desist letter on February 27 but Mr London said that on June 19 he contacted his client on Skype. Mr Buiter disconnected his alleged stalker as a contact on Skype on June 23 but three days later he reconnected her. Court appearance: Mees was arrested on July 1 when the . first criminal complaint was filed. Among the allegations was that she . harassed Mr Buiter's children from his first marriage, David, 22, and . Elizabeth, 19 . Mr London told the court that this behavior ‘only served to illustrate that this was a bilateral relationship and not harassment'. Mees was arrested on July 1 when the first criminal complaint was filed. Among the allegations was that she harassed Mr Buiter's children from his first marriage, David, 22, and Elizabeth, 19. An amended complaint was sent on August 5 removing the allegation that Mr Buiter's children were harassed. The message to Mees from Mr Buiter via LinkedIn was sent two days later. Love triangle: Mees allegedly sent harassing . messages' to Buiter's wife, economics professor Anne Sibert (pictured), . and the couple's two children . It is not clear if he sent it or the message was automated but Judge Quinones made it clear that regardless she was unimpressed. Judge Quinones told the prosecutor: 'The People will admonish the complainant witness (Mr Buiter) that he is not to contact this defendant in any way'. During a testy exchange she raised her voice to Mees to ask that she understood she was to have 'absolutely no contact' with Mr Buiter and his wife under the terms of a protection order. She demurely replied: 'Yes'. Mr London failed in an attempt to have Mees’ £3,200 bail lifted despite telling the court she had an apartment in Brooklyn worth $1.5m of which $1m was in equity. He also told the court that after her arrest she was sacked from her job as a professor at New York University’s Public Service school, though she has since had interviews with two other universities. Mees has yet to plead to five counts of harassment and stalking. She will next appear before the court on October 24. Among the other allegations against her is that she targeted Mr Buiter's wife, Anne Sibert, a professor of economics at the University of London’s Birkbeck college. Mr Buiter, who was not in court yesterday, says in the criminal complaint: ‘The defendant's actions have caused me severe annoyance and alarm, and to fear for my physical safety and for the safety of my wife and my children.’ Mees’ has a chequered history and according to reports in the Dutch media she is a feminist activist who  once wrote a pornographic story for a literary magazine. Speaking after the hearing Mr London said Mees is ‘emotionally distraught’ and said her relationship with Mr Buiter had been ‘intimate’. He said: ‘She had feelings for Mr Buiter and those feelings have been trampled on’, adding that when he contacted her on LinkedIn it made her ‘more distraught than she was’.","Heleen Mees accused of sending more than 3,000 sexually explicit texts and emails to Willem Buiter .

"The man David Cameron has picked to head his Election campaign once launched a foul-mouthed rant against Muslims. Outspoken Australian ‘fixer’ Lynton Crosby used the phrase ‘f****** Muslims’ in a diatribe while working for London Mayor Boris Johnson. But No 10 officials said the Prime Minister has no intention of changing his mind about appointing the strategist, despite the new revelations. In demand: Lynton Crosby, pictured with David Cameron in April during the London Mayoral campaign, has been recruited by the PM despite the racist allegations. Crosby had previous success with Boris Johnson and former Australian Premier John Howard . Mr Crosby’s outburst came earlier this year as Mr Johnson’s aides discussed whether to devote more attention to wooing the ethnic minority vote in his battle with Labour’s Ken Livingstone. According to a source, Mr Crosby said Mr Johnson should concentrate on traditional Tory voters instead of ‘f****** Muslims’. The source added: ‘He definitely used that phrase’ and said: ‘Lynton’s view was that chasing the Muslim vote and other ethnic groups was a waste of time –  and he frequently expressed himself in very strong terms. Some people found it very offensive.’ In a statement last night a spokesman for Mr Crosby said he had ‘absolutely no recollection’ of using the term. His allies claimed Mr Crosby was the victim of a dirty tricks plot by Tory enemies to stop him taking charge of campaigns at Conservative HQ. The spokesman said: ‘It is entirely mischievous to suggest Lynton is racist in any way. He campaigned vigorously for the Muslim vote during the Mayoral race. He has absolutely no recollection whatsoever of making these comments.’ Asked repeatedly if Mr Crosby had uttered the words ‘f****** Muslims’, the spokesman said: ‘As I have said, he has no recollection of doing so.’ It is not the first time Mr Crosby, 55, has been involved in a sensitive row over campaign strategy. The Australian objected to the way Mr Johnson ordered adverts to be removed from London buses which stated that gays could be converted to heterosexuality. Sources close to Mr Crosby denied he was opposed to the adverts being taken down – but said he objected to the way the Mayor briefed newspapers without discussing it with him first. The sources said it was totally untrue and an ‘outrageous lie’ to suggest Mr Crosby is either anti-gay or racist. Mr Johnson last night said he had  ‘no recollection’ of being present when Mr Crosby made his ‘f****** Muslims’ comment. He said his election chief was ‘the soul of sweetness and kindness’. Fan: Boris Johnson urged Tories to give Lynton Crosby a free hand and said he is the 'soul of kindness and sweetness' And the Mayor urged Mr Cameron not to reverse his decision to put Mr Crosby in charge of his election campaign. Mr Johnson said: ‘Lynton Crosby is the soul of kindness and sweetness and is not the reactionary caricature some have painted him to be. He is the best campaign manager anyone can hope for and I congratulate Conservative HQ for securing his services.’ A spokesman for the Mayor added: ‘Boris wants it known that Lynton is not the ogre some make him out to be.’ Asked to confirm the Mayor was present when Mr Crosby referred to ‘f****** Muslims’, the spokesman said: ‘The Mayor has no recollection of the alleged conversation. The Mayor would recognise that there were debates over the direction of strategy. What he would not recognise is any suggestion of abusive or offensive language directed at any particular group of voters from any member of his campaign staff.’ The damaging disclosure comes days after Tory chiefs secretly put the finishing touches to a deal whereby Mr Crosby and his Crosby-Textor political polling company will take charge of the next Tory Election campaign from January. The deal, said to be worth  £200,000 a year was due to be announced in the next few days. Success: Crosby helped John Howard, pictured, win the Australian election in 1996 when he served as Liberal party campaign director . Blunt-talking Mr Crosby, has been called ‘the Wizard of Oz’ because of his legendary success in political campaigns, including winning four terms for former Australian PM John Howard. His supporters have called him one of the most brilliant political strategists of his generation. Tim Montgomerie, editor of Conservative Home, wrote that the Tory Party ‘needs him and needs him desperately. He will bring discipline, clarity and the toughness to the Tory operation that, at present, is so sorely lacking’. But Mr Crosby has powerful enemies in the Party. Some Tory MPs and No 10 advisers believe his advocacy of populist policies, and in particular his views on immigration, could lose votes. Tory Deputy Chairman, Lord Ashcroft took the unusual step of publicly warning Mr Cameron not to sign up Mr Crosby. The peer said last month: ‘I believe it would be a mistake to hire Lynton Crosby. Not because it would lead to a re-run of the immigration-dominated 2005 campaign but because I do not think he is needed and would become a distracting influence. ‘Far from ensuring a single strong manager, this is a recipe for the kind of conflict and confusion that dogged the 2010 campaign and helped cost us the majority we could have won.’ Some insiders have suggested Mr Crosby’s arrival marks a demotion for Mr Cameron’s campaigns chief, Stephen Gilbert, a close confidant of Lord Ashcroft. Nor is Mr Crosby’s appointment approved by all of Mr Cameron’s advisers. Head of strategy Andrew Cooper, who played a key role in Mr Cameron’s ‘modernising’ of the Tory Party away from its Thatcherite image, is said to have voiced doubts – but he has denied threatening to quit over the hiring of Mr Crosby. A source who has worked with Mr Crosby said: ‘Lynton’s problem is that he only has one club in his golf bag. He goes on and on about immigration but there is much more to getting Conservatives re-elected in 2015 than that. ‘Mitt Romney’s defeat shows that a Right-of-centre party cannot win in the modern world by appealing to core voters only. You have to reach out to all groups.’ An ally of Mr Johnson said: ‘Boris was not always comfortable when Lynton talked about ethnic issues.’ Mr Cameron is believed to have sought assurances from Mr Crosby that he will not push the Tories back to the Right if he takes charge of campaigns. Mr Crosby’s most vocal Cabinet supporter is George Osborne. The Chancellor previously persuaded Mr Cameron to appoint former News of the World  editor Andy Coulson as his spin doctor – but Mr Coulson was later forced to resign over the phone-hacking scandal. The best: Boris Johnson, pictured, said Crosby was the 'best campaign manager anyone can hope for' If Lynton Crosby is known for one thing, it is winning elections for Right-wing political leaders by ruthlessly playing the immigration card. Mr Crosby, known as the ‘attack dingo’, has become synonymous with ‘dog whistle politics’ – the repeated use of coded language which plays to the worst fears of certain voters. The term entered the political lexicon when Mr Crosby, running the Tories’ 2005 General Election campaign for leader Michael Howard, is responsible for the slogan: ‘Are you thinking what we’re thinking?’ He deployed messages such as ‘It’s not racist to impose limits on immigration’ and ‘How would you feel if a bloke on early release attacked your daughter?’ on posters and mailshots. Although the tactic failed to prevent a third term for Tony Blair, many Tories believe it helped limit Labour’s majority and provided the platform for revival under David Cameron. As a result, he retains a loyal fan base in the party. Born in 1957 in Kadina, South Australia, the economics graduate soon discovered he had a flair for advising parties on election-winning strategies. Infamously, he was associated with claims in the 2001 Australian general election that asylum seekers had thrown children into the sea. Witty, foul-mouthed and a workaholic, ‘the Wizard of Oz’ is blunt to his political masters. In the 2008 London Mayoral campaign he told Boris Johnson: ‘If you let us down we will cut your f****** knees off.’ The Mayor of London has  little doubt about Mr Crosby’s abilities. This month he told Tory backbenchers they should ‘break the piggybank’ to hire him and give him a ‘free hand’ to take control of campaigning. Those close to Mr Crosby are not offended by his plain speaking – and say it is all part of his charismatic personal style.","Lynton Crosby used the phrase 'f****** Muslims' in diatribe while working for London Mayor Boris Johnson .

"King Abdullah: Two daughters of the Saudi leader say that they and their sisters are being held against their will in the royal compound in Jeddah . Two daughters of the King of Saudi Arabia claim they and their sisters have been held prisoner in the royal palace for 13 years. Princesses Sahar, 42, and Jawaher, 38, said that they are being kept against their will in a guarded villa in the royal compound in Jeddah. Their claims shed light into the usually secret world of royal family of a country where women are effectively treated as second-class citizens. Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that prohibits women from driving. It scored 130th out of 134 countries analysed by the World Economic forum in a 2009 report on gender parity. But the restrictions allegedly placed on Sahar and Jawaher go well beyond what is allowed under Saudi law. In emails and phonecalls to a Sunday newspaper, Sahar and Jawaher claimed that their sisters Hala, 39, and Maha, 41, are also being held, incommunicado, in separate villas in the Jeddah compound. Their mother Alanoud Alfayez, who is divorced from Saudi King Abdullah, has reportedly written to the UN's human rights agency to intervene on their behalf. She told the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) that her daughters are 'imprisoned, held against their will, cut off from the world', according to a report in The Sunday Times. Sahar and Jawaher told the newspaper in an email that they are kept alone in a house most of which they have closed off as they have been left to fend for themselves with nobody to help them with the housework. Royal visit: Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, who has 38 children by many wives, is pictured with the Queen in London in 2007. His country has no problem with the name Elizabeth . 'We slowly watch each other fading away into nothingness,' they said, adding that their sister Hala had told them 'that her mind is slipping away ... that the life is being sucked out of her.' They added that they can only go out to shop for food - and even for this, they need permission from a half-brother whom the king has put in charge of them. It was also revealed that Sahar found a teller's job at a bank through a friend, which she enjoyed because it 'saved me from the monotony and tediousness of life in Saudi'. However, . upon telling her father that she wanted to start working full time, he . blocked it - and said he did not want any of his daughters to be an . employee. 'I tried to persuade him that it was a small women’s bank that dealt with university students’ accounts and that it was quite a decent place,' she said. 'He ridiculed my efforts.' King Abdullah and Prince Philip review a Guard of Honour at Horse Guards, London: Saudi Arabia is a key Middle-East ally of the West. Its royal family enjoy massive wealth, with the king one of the world's richest men . Abdullah became king of Saudi Arabia in 2005. The oil-rich state is a key ally of the U.S. in the Middle East and its extensive royal family enjoy massive wealth, with the king one of the world's richest men. Ms Alfayez was only 15 years old when . she married King Abdullah, who was then in his 40s, but he divorced her . just over a decade later. The . king, who has 38 children by a number of wives, has placed his four . daughters with Alfayez under the control of three of their . half-brothers, according to Sahar. Under Saudi law, girls and women are forbidden from travelling, conducting official business, or undergoing certain medical procedures without the express permission of their male guardians. Sahar said that the sisters had enjoyed a . pampered adolescence but that animosity towards her and her sisters had . grown after they began to complain to their father about the poverty . endured by most of the Saudi people. In discussion: Former US president George W. Bush (left) talks with King Abdullah before a dinner at Al Janadriyah Ranch in Saudi Arabia, in January 2008 . Some of the young princes had also criticised them because of their party-loving lifestyle. 'We slowly watch each other fading away into nothingness' But it was in the late Nineties that matters came to a head when Hala, who has a degree in psychology, complained that the regime's political opponents were being locked up in the psychiatric wards of the hospital where she worked. The Sunday Times said that full details of the allegations made by the sisters and their mother had been put to the Saudi embassy, but there had been no reply. The OHCHR said that it would pass on Ms Alfayez's letter to Rashida Manjoo, who is the UN special rapporteur on violence against women.","Princesses plead for help from captivity at royal compound in Jeddah .

"A furious Ryanair passenger, whose flight was delayed by more than two days, caused an internet storm after live tweeting her ordeal. Corinne Redfern was among 400 passengers trying to return to the UK from the Spanish island of Lanzarote on Friday. However, she was forced to endure a 51-hour wait to get home after bad weather left holidaymakers stranded. Scroll down for video . In a series of more than 40 tweets, Ms Redfern gave a blow-by-blow account of the saga, claiming the budget airline, notorious for its poor customer service, even charged customers for water during the incident . In a series of more than 40 tweets, Ms Redfern gave a blow-by-blow account of the saga, claiming the budget airline even charged customers for water during the incident. Passengers had already arrived at Lanzarote airport in preparation for an 11.45am flight on Friday morning when they were told that their plane had been cancelled due to bad weather. However, when they attempted to contact the Ryanair information desk in the departure lounge, they found it had been shut and staff had left. They were later told that they would be collected from their hotel at 4am on Saturday morning and taken to the airport for a rescheduled flight at 7am. When passengers attempted to contact the Ryanair information desk in the departure lounge at Lanzarote airport, they found it had been shut and staff had left . However, passengers were left even more irate when the bus forgot to arrive to collect the group of 400 holidaymakers. While Ryanair agreed to refund passengers for the cost of staying in a hotel for an extra night, Ms Redfern said that some members of the group were left without money to buy food and drinks because they had been forced to shell out the hotel costs upfront. The group then claim they were initially refused meal vouchers and given no update from the airline about the status of their flight home. It was only three hours after they had missed the second flight to Stansted that customers were provided with £3.50 vouchers – meaning some passengers were left hungry. Despite the improvement in the weather, Ms Redfern claims a third flight was cancelled without explanation. Corinne Redfern has been on a trip to the Spanish island of Lanzarote but endured a 51-hour ordeal getting home to London . Ryanair then announced it had arranged a hotel for half the passengers to spend a further night in Lanzarote. When guests arrived there after queuing for an hour to board a bus they were turned away because the hotel claimed it had no record of the booking. The passengers were eventually transferred back to Lanzarote airport at 4.30am the following morning in preparation for a 7am flight back to London. But the flight was delayed again by two hours and 15 minutes, with passenger being told it was then scheduled to depart at 9.15am. Ms Redfern, a London-based journalist, said that the information desks in the departure lounge remained closed. Two hours later they finally boarded the plane and the group finally arrived home at 14.54pm on Sunday afternoon, having been scheduled to take off on Friday morning at 11.45am. In March this year, Ryanair revealed that it was undergoing a revolutionary image change . Ms Redfern said she attempted to use her meal vouchers to buy a bottle of water on the journey home because she had no Euros left, but was denied by the cabin crew. A Ryanair spokesman said today: ‘Due to severe weather at Lanzarote, three flights to Birmingham, East Midlands and London Stansted were delayed on Friday and Saturday. ‘Affected customers were provided with meal vouchers and hotel accommodation, and were sent regular updates by email and SMS text. ‘Weather improvements allowed normal flight operations to resume on Sunday when these flights operated. ‘Ryanair sincerely apologised to all customers affected by these weather delays, which were entirely beyond our control, and all customers returned home on Sunday.’ The incident comes several days after another group of Ryanair passengers travelling to Lanzarote claim they were left confused and out of pocket after their flight was diverted to a different island in the Canaries. The plane carrying 140 holidaymakers from Dublin last week was forced to land on neighbouring Fuerteventura due to severe thunderstorms. Passengers say they were told they would be able to hop on a ferry to complete their journey, but claim they were then crammed onto buses and taken to the port without proper instruction. Some grew frustrated with the lengthy wait at the airport and paid more than £30 for a taxi.","Corinne Redfern was among 400 passengers trying to return to the UK .

"The new chairman of a long-awaited Government inquiry into historic child sex abuse was facing calls to resign last night after The Mail on Sunday discovered her astonishing links to Leon Brittan – a key figure embroiled in the scandal. Fiona Woolf, the Lord Mayor of London, was appointed to carry out the important role of investigating claims of an Establishment cover-up of VIP paedophile rings on Friday, two months after the original chairman was forced to step down over conflicts of interest. But this newspaper has found that the top corporate lawyer is also closely linked to Lord Brittan – who is likely to give evidence to her inquiry. It can be revealed that she: . Scroll down for video . Lord Brittan is accused of overseeing an Establishment cover-up when he was Home Secretary . Last night Labour MP Simon Danczuk – who has led calls for a public inquiry into historic child sex abuse in the wake of revelations about high-profile figures such as Sir Jimmy Savile – questioned Mrs Woolf’s appointment. ‘If it’s found that Fiona Woolf is close to the Brittans, her position is untenable and she needs to be clear about what her relationship is with Leon Brittan, who is one of the most significant figures in terms of suggestions of a cover-up,’ he said. ‘Surely the Home Office was aware of this before they suggested appointing her?’ Peter Saunders, the chairman of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘It would once again seem to be incredibly inappropriate that she would even be offered the appointment.’ Chairmen past and present: Baroness Butler-Schloss (left) stood down because her brother Lord Havers was Attorney General during the 1980s, when he tried to dissuade the Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens from revealing that senior diplomat Sir Peter Hayman was a paedophile; Fiona Woolf, the Lord Mayor of London, replaced her but she, too, has links to Leon Brittan . Home Secretary Theresa May, who personally appointed Mrs Woolf after her background was checked by officials, was also facing questions about her judgement. Last night it was not clear if she had been made aware of Mrs Woolf’s close association with the Brittans. Labour MP John Mann said: ‘If Fiona Woolf is friends with Leon Brittan, that is a problem. If that’s the case, she shouldn’t have accepted the job. She needs to move straight away to clear the air – it would be a catastrophe to lose a second chairman. ‘The Home Office also needs to clear the air and demonstrate that it did due diligence.’ And Labour MP Keith Vaz said that he would call Mrs Woolf to give evidence before his influential Home Affairs Select Committee, adding: ‘I am sure she will want to be as open and transparent as possible.’ The public inquiry was announced in early July, following months of pressure from MPs and campaign groups as more and more claims emerged of secret VIP sex rings across Britain and child abuse in schools, hospitals and churches, dating back more than 30 years, with the perpetrators spared justice by an Establishment cover-up. It suffered a massive setback within weeks when the chairman, former High Court judge Baroness Butler-Sloss, was forced to quit over conflicts of interest. Over the summer, the Home Office has been searching for a suitable replacement whose experience and background would command respect from victims and Westminster, while also having the required distance from the individuals and institutions they will have to scrutinise. On Friday, it was announced that Mrs Woolf had been appointed, with the aim of publishing an interim report before next May’s General Election. Mrs Woolf said she was ‘honoured’ and added that learning from the mistakes of the past was a ‘vital and solemn undertaking’. Baroness Butler-Sloss was originally appointed to lead the inquiry into historic allegations of child abuse but stood down because of concern over potential conflict of interest. Now, however, her links may be seen as less concerning than those that have put Fiona Woolf’s appointment in doubt. Lady Butler-Sloss’s brother, Lord Havers, was Attorney General during the 1980s, when he tried to dissuade the Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens from revealing that senior diplomat Sir Peter Hayman was a paedophile. But Mr Dickens, who handed a dossier on alleged child abusers to then Home Secretary Sir Leon Brittan, used parliamentary privilege to name Hayman as a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange. Hayman was given a police caution for possessing child abuse images. The baroness had chaired the Cleveland inquiry into child abuse and was once the highest-ranking female judge in Britain and president of the Family Division of the High Court. But despite her expertise, critics still said she should resign because of her brother’s history. On quitting, she said she had never put the reputation of an institution before justice for victims. But MoS research soon suggested the Home Office had not learned from its own mistakes. Publicly available documents revealed that Mrs Woolf, 66, has several close links to the former Home Secretary Lord Brittan and his wife. It calls into question her ability to run the inquiry because earlier this year Lord Brittan was at the centre of a storm over an alleged cover-up of child sex abuse and a missing list of alleged VIP paedophiles. He admitted he had received the so-called ‘Dickens dossier’ from campaigning MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983 but insisted he had passed the papers on to Home Office officials. It then emerged he had recently been questioned by Scotland Yard over allegations that he raped an 19-year-old in 1967. He denies the claims and has not been arrested or charged. The Home Office last night refused to answer questions about what it had known about Mrs Woolf’s links to Lord Brittan. The Brittans yesterday refused to answer questions from The Mail On Sunday as they drove away from their home. Mrs Woolf could not be reached.","Fiona Woolf, the Lord Mayor of London, appointed to carry out role of investigating claims of an Establishment cover-up of VIP paedophile rings .

"Facing run: Whistleblower David Ore . A hospital manager who spoke out about staff locking up vulnerable patients said last night that he faces ruin despite a government pledge to protect whistleblowers. David Ore told his NHS bosses children and pensioners were being restrained and locked in hospital cubicles for up to 12 hours without food or drink. He said guards were being ordered almost every day to throw patients to the ground and drag them to rooms before holding the door shut so they could not get out. Pensioners were being restrained to ease the burden on overstretched  doctors and nurses, Mr Ore said. He said the violent security policy even led to the death of an elderly man at failing Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley in the West Midlands, the largest of the three run by the Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. Mr Ore managed security staff across the three hospitals, but after repeatedly raising concerns with his bosses he was suspended in November 2012 and sacked five months later after a disciplinary hearing. He won an appeal but was again ordered out on  ‘special leave’ in January – two days after an article about Russells Hall Hospital restraining patients appeared in the media. Bosses have since written to Mr Ore to say he was being removed because speaking out about his ‘concerns about the alleged illegal restraint of patients’ could have put him in ‘a very difficult position’. Now, despite repeated reassurances from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt that whistleblowers will be protected, he has been given 30 days’ notice of his potential redundancy. It is thought the hospital – which is under investigation over high death rates – has spent around £100,000 of taxpayers’ money on the case. Last night Mr Ore told the Mail he felt forced to speak out, but now faced ruin. ‘Because I spoke out I was treated awfully,’ he said. ‘As a whistleblower, I have been treated worse than a common criminal. The hospital just deny, deny, hide, hide.’ He added: ‘This is about people in that hospital who are being harmed psychologically and physically every day. Their rights to self-determination are being totally disregarded. That could be a relative of yours being put through hell – not just for a few hours, but for days and weeks.’ MPs and campaigners said there were serious questions over Mr Hunt’s ability to crack down on the vilification of whistleblowers. The Health Secretary says creating a culture of ‘openness and transparency’ in the NHS is vital to prevent a repeat of the Mid  Staffordshire scandal in which up to 1,200 patients died needlessly. Jeremy Hunt has given repeated reassurances that whistleblowers will be protected . He banned gagging clauses last year after the Mail revealed the case of former Lincolnshire hospitals chief Gary Walker who broke a £500,000 gagging clause to speak out about high death rates. Mr Hunt then made urgent changes to the NHS constitution last week after the Mail reported that whistleblower Sandra Haynes Kirkbright had been threatened with the sack for speaking out about hospital bosses in Wolverhampton fiddling death figures. Abandoned: Mohammed Yasin . A frail pensioner died after being removed by security guards at  Russells Hall Hospital in a shocking incident hospital bosses allegedly tried to cover up. Grandfather Mohammed Yasin, 73, had become angry and upset when he was taken to A&E by ambulance after collapsing on a freezing November evening in 2008. The academic, whose family live in India, was taken outside in a wheelchair by guards at 1am and left alone at a bus stop. Mr Yasin, who lived alone in Lye, West Midlands, was discovered dead just over four hours later by a passerby 50 yards from the hospital. Last night his friends said his death was ‘despicable’ and claim they were asked to keep quiet. The Dudley Group said Mr Yasin’s friends were visited after his death by then chief executive Paul Farenden and a senior consultant. The trust denied the friends were told not to speak to the press. At his inquest, registrar Dr David Raven said: ‘I would have assumed a taxi would be called or another method found.’ The coroner recorded an open verdict. He said NHS contracts would now . include a ‘right’ to raise concerns about care and a national helpline . would be set up to offer advice to potential NHS whistleblowers. Mr Ore’s case suggests hospital bosses are continuing to defy  government orders. Tory . MP Andrew Percy, a member of the Commons health select  committee, . said: ‘If we continue to see this sort of behaviour we will need to look . at whether the law is strong enough.’ Mr Ore’s local Labour MP Ian Austin has now written to the Health Secretary demanding to know if and how Mr Ore will be protected. Former policeman Mr Ore, 58, repeatedly raised concerns with his bosses about the restraint of vulnerable patients from 2010. He also contacted children’s charity Barnardo’s who drafted a damning report warning bosses the practice violated civil and criminal law. Mr Ore was accused of gross misconduct for showing ‘aggressive behaviour’ and parking in hospital bays he wasn’t allowed to use, which he denies, before being  suspended in 2012. He says the case against him ‘has everything to do with whistleblowing’. The trust denies Mr Ore’s claims but admits security staff raised concerns about restraint. The Dudley Group accepted Mr Ore spoke out about restraint and this has formed part of a claim he is making at an employment tribunal. However, it said he did so simply as part of his job and he had not done so through the hospital’s  official whistleblower policy. Chief executive Paula Clark added: ‘There are occasions where patients have required restraint to be used for their own safety and the safety of our staff and other patients. However, we emphatically refute the suggestion that we unlawfully restrain patients. ‘We encourage our staff to raise genuine concerns at the earliest opportunity using our whistleblowing policy.’ A spokesman for Jeremy Hunt said: ‘These are very serious allegations, and that’s why the Care Quality Commission has already been asked to carry out an investigation at this hospital.’ The Department of Health said Mr Hunt has been ‘absolutely clear that NHS staff who have the courage and integrity to speak out in the interests of patient safety must be protected and listened to’.","David Ore told bosses about problems at Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley .

"A lawyer for an American who has spent more than four years imprisoned in Cuba said Monday that his client cannot take life in prison much longer and has said his goodbyes to his wife and a daughter. Alan Gross was arrested in Cuba in 2009 while working covertly in the Communist-run country to set up Internet access. His attorney, Scott Gilbert, said in a statement Monday that his client 'has withdrawn' and told him 'life in prison is not a life worth living.' Gross has previously said through his lawyer that his 65th birthday, which took place in May, would be the last one that he 'celebrates in Havana, one way or the other.' American Alan Gross aid goodbye to his wife and youngest daughter during a recent visit in Cuba. Gross has stopped exercising and his health is not good, his attorney said . Gross said goodbye to his wife and youngest daughter during a recent visit. Gross, who lived in Maryland before his arrest, had previously told his two daughters not to come see him in prison. Gross has stopped exercising and his health is not good, said Gilbert, who plans to visit his client this week. His hips are failing and he has lost most of the vision in his right eye. Gross' 'emotional deterioration has been severe,' Gilbert said, particularly following the death in June of his 92-year-old mother. Gross and his mother talked frequently by phone, and when Gross went on a nine-day hunger strike in April it was his mother who persuaded him to end it. Gross had asked the Cuban government to be able to return to the United States for her funeral, but the request was denied. Gross' wife, Judy Gross, said in Monday's statement that she has never seen her husband in such bad shape during the time he has spent in prison. She wrote that 'his decision to say goodbye to us was wrenching.' At the time Gross was arrested he was working as a subcontractor for the U.S. government's U.S. Agency for International Development, which promotes democracy on the island . Gross is also now refusing to see officials from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, which Washington maintains instead of an embassy since the two countries do not have formal diplomatic relations. At the time Gross was arrested he was working as a subcontractor for the U.S. government's U.S. Agency for International Development, which promotes democracy on the island. Cuba considers USAID's programs illegal attempts by the U.S. to undermine its government, and Gross was tried and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Also on Monday, Gross' lawyer released a letter from a group of 300 rabbis to President Barack Obama urging him to take action to secure Gross' release. Gross, who is Jewish, was working with Cuba's small Jewish community on Internet access when he was arrested.","Alan Gross, 65, was arrested in Cuba in 2009 while working covertly in the Communist-run country to set up Internet access .

"Shocking footage has emerged of the moment a Boeing 737 plane crashed into the tarmac and burst into flames, killing all 50 passengers and crew on board. The video shows the plane descending in a steep dive before exploding in a giant fireball on the runway the Russian city of Kazan yesterday. The chilling video was broadcast today by Russian television stations. Scroll down for video . The video shows the light emitting from the Boeing 737 during its second attempt at a landing as it descends in a steep five towards the runway . The brief video was taken by an airport security camera and shows the plane going down at high speed . The plane explodes after crash landing at a near vertical angle and kills all 50 passengers and crew on board . The Tatarstan Airlines plane was making its second attempt at a landing, according to Alexander Poltinin, head of the local branch of Russia's Investigative Committee, who said investigators are looking into possible pilot error or equipment failure. The traffic controller at the Kazan airport who contacted the plane before the crash said the crew told him they were not ready to land as it was approaching but did not specify the problem. The brief video taken by an airport security camera showed the plane going down at high speed at a nearly vertical angle and then hitting the ground and exploding. Fragments of the plane littered the tarmac and fire crews spent hours extinguishing the blaze. Poltinin said it could take weeks to identify the remains. The Tatarstan Airlines craft burst into flames upon impact on the runway on Sunday . Investigators are trying to determine the cause of the crash and have recovered the black box recorder . The investigators have found both of the plane's black boxes but said they were damaged. The boxes contain the recording of its systems performance and crew conversations and are essential for the crash probe. Magomed Tolboyev, a highly decorated Russian test pilot, said on Rossiya television that it wasn't immediately clear why the crew was unable to land on their first try in good weather, saying it could be linked to a failure of some of the plane's systems or a crew error. British mother Donna Bull, 53, who was among 50 people who died when the Boeing 737 crashed . Investigators on Monday started looking through the company's records as part of the crash probe. The plane was built 23 years ago and had seen service with seven other carriers prior to being commissioned by Tatarstan Airlines. In 2001, it was damaged in a landing accident in Brazil that injured no one. The aircraft has been in service with Tatarstan Airlines since 2008. The company insisted that the aircraft was in good condition for the flight. A fuel tank was said to have exploded as the plane came down. The . plane, which took off from Domodedovo airport in Moscow, crashed at . 7.20pm, or 3.20pm GMT, today, at the airport in Kazan, located in Tatarstan, in the in the . west of the country. A spokesman for the Russian . Emergencies Ministry, Irina Rossius, said there were 44 passengers and . six crew members aboard and all had been killed. 'The plane made several attempts to land,' she said. 'During the final attempt, one of the fuel tanks exploded.' The carrier has had a good safety record, but appears to have run into financial problems recently. Its personnel went on strike in . September over back wages, and the Kazan airport authority has gone to . arbitration to claim what it said was Tatarstan Airlines' debt for . servicing its planes.

"A predatory paedophile who built up an established network of care homes has been accused of supplying boys for Westminster sex parties. John Allen, 73, was convicted last week at Mold Crown Court of 33 sex offences against children in his care. The court heard how he ran an oppressive regime where he deprived children who spoke out against the abuse of food and water. He has now been named by a former council leader as being suspected of supplying boys to other paedophiles, including those allegedly held for prominent politicians at Dolphin Square in central London. John Allen, 73, was convicted last week at Mold Crown Court of 33 sex offences against children in his care . Dennis Parry, a former leader of Clwyd county council, told the Sunday Times: 'My information was that not only was he an abuser, he was a supplier. 'There was movement between Holland and this country, and Dolphin Square was part of the set-up.' Mr Parry, who commissioned the Jillings report in the early 1990s which looked in to abuse allegations in north Wales children's homes, added: 'There was a guy - whose names hasn't come up so far - and he was working within that Dolphin Square system. 'My information was he was the one who collected the young people and took them to Dolphin Square...his links were with our part of north Wales and others.' The court heard how Allen ran an oppressive regime at the Bryn Alyn care home in Wrexham, where he deprived children who spoke out against the abuse of food and water . It has been alleged that Allen was not only an abuser but also a supplier and helped transfer boys in his care to Dolphin Square, in central London, which is at the centre of an allegation that MPs used it to abuse boys . Upmarket Dolphin Square, an apartment block in Pimlico, was once where many Members of Parliament had their London homes. At one point the flats were home to up to 70 MPs and around 10 lords. In July, two victims of alleged child abuse claimed they were raped by MPs after they were plied with whisky at Dolphin Square, a short walk from the Commons. One of the men told how the MPs held his head under water as they raped him. Then, earlier this month it was revealed that detectives are investigating claims three boys died during abuse at the parties, which were allegedly attended by a Conservative MP. In 1968 Allen, a hotelier with no background in child care, set up the Bryn Alyn care home (pictured) - he went on to abuse children in his care and is due to be sentenced tomorrow . Allen is due to be sentenced tomorrow and may receive a life term. His case was the first to come to court under Operation Pallial, a fresh investigation into historic allegations of North Wales child abuse. This is not the first time Allen has been convicted of child abuse, as there had been two previous investigations into the former care home boss. One led to his conviction in 1995 of six counts of indecent assault against six boys, aged between 12 and 16, in the 1970s, which led to him being jailed for six years. He faced a further 44 charges in 2003 but these were dropped after a judge ruled the time lapse meant he would not face a fair trial. After that, he went into hiding. By 2012 he was found working as a night porter at a Premier Inn hotel living alone in a £120,000 one-bedroom rented flat in Needham Market, near Ipswich. Allen was jailed for six years in 1995 for child sex abuse - but when Operation Pallial was launched more victims came forward to speak out about abuse . He was then the first arrested under Operation Pallial in April 2013 about 45 years after he started his children's care homes empire, which had an annual turnover of £2.7million. In 1968 Allen, a hotelier with no background in child care, set up the Bryn Alyn care home. Over the next 20 years, he created 11 homes in and around the Wrexham area. At its height, the capacity of the whole of the Bryn Alyn Community was approximately 100 to 120 children. Many of the abuse allegations took place at three homes – Bryn Alyn, Pentre Season and Bryn Tirion, but mainly at Bryn Alyn. Allen was aged in his 30s and 40s, and the children's ages ranged from seven to 15. When Operation Pallial launched, more victims came forward claiming to have been abused at the hands of Allen. During his recent trial at Mold Crown Court Allen denied all 40 charges against him, including indecent assault, indecency with a child and buggery and attempted buggery. He labelled his victims 'fantasists' wanting compensation who were blaming him for things that had gone wrong in their lives. Twenty former Bryn Alyn residents – 19 boys and a girl aged between seven and 15 at the time – who had lived at the homes between 1968 and 1991 spoke out in court. Ian Mulcahey, senior investigating officer with Operation Pallial, the police inquiry into child sexual abuse in Welsh care homes, said: 'John Allen abused vulnerable children he was entrusted to protect. 'He was a violent man, which he used towards children in his care. In spite of the verdicts, the impact on the lives of those John Allen abused may never be undone.' 'He was like a father figure, but he turned out to be a monster': Victim speaks of terror he suffered at the hands of paedophile . The victim of paedophile John Allen has spoken of the terror he suffered at his hands. Stephen Fong, now 50, said he was physically rather than sexually abused by Allen, but turned to drugs to help him forget the dark memories. He was moved to a care home owned by Allen as an 11-year-old in 1975. Mr Fong said: 'The physical, verbal and mental abuse was horrific. He was like a father figure, but he turned out to be a monster. 'Being a 10 or 11-year-old kid and being physically abused, punched, kicked or smashed around an office, a bedroom or a hallway - was the norm.' Stephen Fong, a victim of John Allen, pictured as a child - he said he turned to drugs to help blur the memories of the abuse he suffered in the care home . Mr Fong, who now owns a gym in Wrexham, said his teenager years were marred by drug abuse to help him cope with the memories of his time in care. He said meeting his wife 43-year-old Kathryn, 26 years ago was the moment he turned his life around . Mr Fong, who has two daughters Paris, 23, Chanel, 21, and a son Leion, 13, added: 'Maybe I’m a little bit stronger, but it’s my wife and my kids and friends around me. Maybe if I didn’t have that I’d be in a (worse) position that other survivors are in now.'","John Allen was convicted of 33 sex offences against children in his care .

"Derbyshire Chief Constable Mick Creedon was serving as a detective sergeant in Leicestershire when allegations surfaced against Labour MP Greville Janner in 1989 . Police chiefs blocked a paedophile probe into a top politician 25 years ago, one of the country’s most senior officers said yesterday. Derbyshire Chief Constable Mick Creedon was serving as a detective sergeant in Leicestershire when allegations surfaced against Labour MP Greville Janner in 1989. Mr Creedon said he was ordered to limit his inquiries into the MP, now Lord Janner of Braunstone. He was forbidden from arresting the politician or searching his home, despite ‘credible evidence’ that warranted further investigation. The chief constable said the message was passed on by a superintendent, but he believes it came from higher up. ‘The decision was clear, he will be interviewed by appointment and there won’t be a search of his home, his constituency office or his office in the Commons,’ he said, adding: ‘It was a decision made by people more senior than me.’ His comments are likely to fuel widespread dissatisfaction with the way allegations against Lord Janner were originally handled. The claims surfaced during an investigation into Frank Beck, the manager of Leicester children’s homes, who died in jail after being convicted of abusing boys in his care. One former care home resident alleged that he had a two-year sexual relationship with the MP when he was a teenager in the 1970s. The alleged victim later caused controversy when he aired his claim while giving evidence at Beck’s trial in 1991. When the allegations became public, the jury was told they were a ‘red herring’ and irrelevant. The police inquiry was limited to an interview at Leicestershire police headquarters during which Lord Janner gave ‘no comment’ answers. A file was sent to the CPS, which decided there was insufficient evidence to bring charges. Lord Janner of Braunstone (right) has denied claims he historically abused children . MPs on all sides rallied around Lord Janner when he spoke in the House of Commons to condemn the claims and say they did not contain a ‘shred of truth’. But the witness was able to produce affectionate letters allegedly from the MP, some on House of Commons notepaper. He also gave a detailed description of the inside of his home. Mr Creedon said there were concerns about the credibility of the evidence against Lord Janner, including the veracity of the key witness. But he added: ‘I look at this now, as a chief constable, as a senior investigating officer, in the light of many inquiries before and since – and one of the lines of inquiry could have been to search the house. ‘My view was always that the allegations were very serious, there was enough evidence to put a file before the CPS, and as investigating officers our job was to search out as much evidence as possible to prove or disprove the offence. My interpretation of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act would be that under the circumstances it would have been justified to search the house and offices.’ Lord Janner, who represented Leicester North West and then Leicester West for 27 years, was made a life peer on his retirement from Parliament in 1997. The father-of-three, who is now 86, has repeatedly strongly denied the allegations against him. He is currently at the centre of a new inquiry by the Leicestershire force called Operation Enamel, which has led to warrants being obtained to search his home in north London and his office in the House of Lords. But detectives have been unable to question Lord Janner because he is frail and suffering from dementia.","Chief Constable Mick Creedon blocked from investigating child abuse claims .

"Jackie Kennedy was so upset at her husband’s death that she asked a priest if she would still meet her husband in heaven if she committed suicide. The former First Lady told Father Richard McSorley that she was ‘so bleeding inside’ over John F Kennedy’s assassination that she wanted to take her own life. Such was her grief that could not even look at a picture of her husband’s face - the only one she had was of him with his back turned. Scroll down for video . Grief: Members of the Kennedy family at the funeral of assassinated president John F. Kennedy at Washington DC. From left: Ted, Caroline (aged 6), Mrs Kennedy, Bobby and three-year-old John who made the world weep when he saluted his father's coffin . Mrs Kennedy even said that she would welcome a wave of copycat suicides after her death as it would allow America to ‘get out of their misery’. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy holds the hands of her two children, John Jr  and Caroline, as they leave the White House to attend the Lying-in-State of assassinated President John F Kennedy at the Capitol, Washington . The insight into her unbearable anguish is revealed in a new biography called ‘Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: The Untold Story’ by US author Barbara Leaming - extracts of which are published in this month's Vanity Fair. It is one of the most detailed accounts yet of the fallout from the assassination of Mr Kennedy, who was shot dead as his motorcade drove through Dallas, Texas in November 1963. According to Mrs Leaming, Mrs Kennedy spent the rest of the winter that year in a state of turmoil as she constantly replayed the horror in her mind. She drank heavily - vodka became her anaesthetic - but she would wake up screaming on the few occasions she was able to sleep. Solace came from Father McSorley, a theology teacher at Georgetown University who she met after he was hired to give her tennis lessons as he was a keen player. According to the book, Mrs Kennedy asked him: ‘Do you think God would separate me from my husband if I killed myself? ‘It is so hard to bear. I feel as though I am going out of my mind at times.’ Mrs Kennedy also insisted that her two young children, Caroline and John, would be better off on their own and said: ‘I’m no good to them. I’m so bleeding inside.’ Months later the two met again and Mrs Kennedy had not moved on. Happy family: President John F. Kennedy and wife Jackie with their daughter Caroline are pictured (left) in 1960 and (right) in 1959, before he became president . First Family: John and Jackie and their two children, Caroline and John Jr . Prior to the assassination, President John F. Kennedy, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, and Texas Governor John Connally ride through the streets of Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963 . Jacqueline Kennedy, her clothing splattered with the blood of her assassinated husband, watches as the body of the dead president is placed in an ambulance following arrival at Andrews Airforce Base . She said that she wanted to take her own life and be like Marilyn Monroe, who allegedly had an affair with her husband and appears to have committed suicide. Mrs Kennedy said: ‘I was glad that Marilyn Monroe got out of her misery. ‘If God is going to make such a to-do about judging people because they take their own lives, then someone ought to punish Him’. According to Mrs Leaming, Mrs Kennedy’s symptoms strongly suggest that she was suffering from an undiagnosed form of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Six months on and, speaking at a service on what would have been her husband’s 47th birthday, she felt that she was back to square one in terms of her grieving. Fateful: JFK and Jackie arrive at Love Field airport in November 1963. The grief stricken First Lady said after her husband's assassination that she envied Marilyn Monroe's supposed suicide . The sight of her husband’s face in photographs was too much so she removed any of him from the White House. Defence Secretary Bob McNamara and his wife Marg sent over two painted portraits of JFK to try to cheer her up so she accepted the smaller one of the two - and could not even stand to keep that. Her agony was compounded when young John saw it, took a lollipop out of his mouth and kissed it, saying: ‘Good night, Daddy’. Mrs Kennedy was eventually forced to leave the White House and make way for Lyndon Johnson, who had been sworn in hours after her husband died. In the autumn of 1964 she decided to leave Washington entirely and move to New York City to begin a new life - but bristled at the suggestion she would remarry. According to the book Mrs Kennedy told friends: ‘I consider that my life is over, and I will spend the rest of my life waiting for it really to be over.’","Jackie Kennedy's grief after death of JFK laid bare in new biography .

"A 26-year-old Florida woman may never walk again after her kind gesture to offer a stranger a ride to the hospital turned into a nightmare attack that has ruined her life. Tallahassee-resident Katie Schlinger told her traumatic story to MailOnline, revealing details about the night she offered to drive a stranger to the hospital before 'he physically and sexually attacked her'. Ms Schlinger says she fought back and escaped with her life, but two spinal surgeries later, she still can't use her right arm or walk on her own. And since she's uninsured, she already owes one hospital $250,000 and is about to be kicked out of a third. Survivor: 26-year-old Katie Schlinger survived a horrific attack late last month when she offered to drive a stranger to the hospital . It all goes back to December 20 when . Ms Schlinger was in Aiken, South Carolina, to support her brother as he . underwent open heart surgery at Aiken Regional Medical Center. Arrested: 23-year-old Michael Antwon Fuller is currently facing charges in Schlinger's attack. He was found semi-conscious in her car with a pistol . She . was smoking a cigarette in the car at the nearby Quality Inn around 4am . when she was approached by 23-year-old Michael Antwon Fuller who asked . her for a cigarette and the two started talking about their relatives in . the hospital. Fuller . told her he was worried about his uncle at the hospital and wondered if . she wouldn’t mind driving him up there so he could see him. ‘Yeah . I’ll give you a ride if you promise not to hurt me,’ she joked, . agreeing to drive him since the hospital was only four minutes away and . Fuller was clean cut, well-spoken and well dressed. ‘Who could hurt that precious face?’  Ms Schlinger recalls him responding. As . they drove up to the hospital, Ms Schlinger began to turn into the main . entrance but Fuller told her it was a different entrance. The second . entrance was the emergency entrance and he told her not to turn there . either, she told MailOnline. From there the road . went pitch black and when Ms Schlinger turned to tell him she didn’t think . there was another entrance, he allegedly hit her face with the mouth of his gun. Ms Schlinger . says she started to cry and begged him to take her car or her money, . but she says he told her to just keep driving and hit her on the head with his . pistol. She agreed . and started driving but slowly moved her hand to the door handle. She . hit the gas right before she opened the door and hurled herself out of . the moving vehicle. By the time she stopped rolling and got up, Fuller had somehow put the car in park and caught up with her, she said. Outside of the car, she says he pointed his gun at her and forced her to perform oral sex. ‘I . kept begging him not to rape me,’ she said. Hoping to save herself, she . offered to drive him to an ATM and give him all the money in her bank . account. Totaled: Schlinger tried to escape by reversing her Dodge Durango towards the emergency hospital area. It hit a tree and the crash caused Fuller to pass out . ‘I lied and told him I had thousands of dollars in my bank account. I didn’t have thousands of dollars,’ she said. ‘I knew if I kept driving I was going to die, so I put the car in reverse and aimed for the emergency hospital area.’ According to Ms Schlinger, Fuller . tried to stop her, continuing to hit her on the head with his pistol . before moving over onto her lap to try to control the car. The two were fighting over the wheel and the car propelled into a tree, totalling the $8,000 Dodge . Durango she just paid off. Even . though the crash happened right in front of the hospital, no one seemed . to notice the crash so when she came to, Schlinger was still alone in . the car with Fuller – trapped underneath him from their struggle. The bill: Since the attack, uninsured Schlinger has been treated at three hospitals and already racked up a $250,000 bill already . She . says it took nearly half an hour to move his weight off her without . waking him. She decided it was safer to climb out the window than open . the door which she thought would wake him up as well. After falling out of the car she crawled to a bush to hide, and eventually a car went by that brought her to the hospital. Survivor: Friends of the 26-year-old are currently raising money online for cover some of her medical bills . While . Schlinger was being treated at the hospital, police arrived on the . scene and found Fuller still in the car, semi-conscious with the pistol. Fuller was arrested . and is facing charges of kidnapping, criminal sexual conduct, unlawful . carrying of a pistol and possession of a weapon with the commission of a . crime. Ms Schlinger, who is still recovering . from the accident at a rehabilitation center, describes the experience . as horrific and says she still continually wakes up with night terrors. 'It's been awful. It's been the most painful, traumatic experience of my life. The man ruined my life,' she said. But it was just the beginning of the nightmare. Doctors . treated Ms Schlinger at Aiken before transferring her to MCG Health . Systems in Augusta, Georgia where she underwent two spinal surgeries. At . first, doctors said she would never be able to walk again and though . there’s now hope that she’ll regain some of that movement, at the very . least she’ll have to carry a cane for the rest of her life. Because . she is uninsured, she was dismissed from the second hospital but her . victim advocate was able to secure her transfer to a $2,000 a day rehab . facility for a free 10 day stay which she started on Friday. Schlinger . says she was told she needs at least four months of rehab to regain . skills like writing again, but has to do as much as she can with the 10 . days she has. ‘I can’t write, I can’t dress myself, I can’t do anything, I can’t brush my teeth by myself, I have to relearn,’ she said. It also doesn't help that she won't soon be able to go back to her job at a storage facility, since she can't type or move. She hasn’t gotten the bill from the Aiken hospital yet, but the total for MCG is already 250,000. Friends . and family have started an online campaign to raise $100,000 to cover . some of her medical bills. As of early Sunday, they had raised over . $9,000 of that goal.","Katie Schlinger, 26, says she offered to give Michael Antwon Fuller, 23, a ride to the hospital .

"Peter Hayman has been named as one of a group of paedophiles alleged to have sexually abused young boys at Dolphin Square . The diplomat Peter Hayman sexually abused young boys at an apartment complex near Parliament, an alleged victim has claimed. Hayman, who died in 1992, was investigated by police in 1978 for possessing inappropriate literature, but was not prosecuted. He has been named  as one of a number of paedophiles by a man, now in his forties, who claims to have been abused over a period of three years at Dolphin Square. The information has been passed to Scotland Yard to consider as part of its investigation into historic allegations of sexual abuse at Westminster. Hayman, referred to as a diplomat, was pointed out in a photograph shown to man, 'Nick', by Exaro, an investigative website. 'He used to like to kiss and to touch, liked me to do that to him. 'But it would always culminate in being raped. That is what happened all the time. 'That was normal,' he said. Starting in 1979, when he was just 11, Nick claims to have been abused by a number of VIPs in the luxury apartment complex. 'Hayman was rather cold, but then a lot of them were - emotionless. 'He does not feature big for me, as some of the others do. He was not one of the nasty ones,' he added. At the time he thought Hayman was an MP for all the time he spent mixing with politicians, he said. 'I learned his name over a number of sessions,' he said, adding he was often raped at 'abuse parties' where two senior Conservative MPs sexually assaulted him. The men, who are alleged to include a former Cabinet minister, cannot be named for legal reasons. In 1981 Hayman was ousted as a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), an organisation which promoted sex with children, under parliamentary privilege. Three years earlier, he had been investigated by police after a package of 'obscene literature' was found on a bus and traced back to him. In 1984, the Oxford-graduate was convicted of gross indecency following an incident in a public lavatory. Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens (left) revealed Hayman's connection to the Paedophile Information Exchange in 1981. It was alleged Sir Thomas Hetherington (right) did not agree to Hayman being prosecuted over a package of 'obscene literature' in what the alleged victim claimed was part of a cover-up . Nick alleges several high-placed individuals abused him and other boys at Dolphin Square (pictured) in 1979 . Sir Thomas Hetherington, the then director of public prosecutions, did not agree to to Hayman being prosecuted and Nick claims this was part of an attempt to protect a ring of high-placed paedophiles. The failure of investigators to prosecute Hayman over the package left Nick 'feeling numb'. 'I know times change, and if you were caught today leaving that sort of thing on a bus you would be arrested and charged. 'If he had been arrested, would he have given up the others? I doubt it. Would his arrest have led to the disruption of the group which might have made a difference? It could have done. 'Really, it does not surprise me that they did not do anything because of who else was involved, and it just adds to the growing list of missed opportunities for it to end. 'It was all just a cover-up, whether to protect the group or protect the establishment’s reputation.' Dolphin Square was last week named as one of the locations where abuse was carried out. Investigation into what occurred in the complex decades ago forms part of Operation Fairbank, a large scale investigation into allegations of abuse by high-placed public figures. 1937: Peter Hayman joined the Home Office as a civil servant after graduating from Oxford . 1941: Hayman became assistant private secretary to then home secretary, Herbert Morrison . 1942-1945: He served as a majr in the Rifle Brigade during the Second World War . 1950: Hayman joined the Ministry of Defence as assistant secretary . 1952 - 1954: Part of the UK delegation to NATO . 1954: Aged 40, Hayman joined Britain's overseas intelligence agency . 1955 - 1958: Station chief for MI6 in Belgrade, then know as Yugoslavia . 1958 - 1959: He performs the same role in Malta . 1959 - 1961: Hayman became station chief in Baghdad . 1961 - 1964: Director General of British Information Services in Washington DC . 1964 - 1966: Deputy commandant of the military government in West Berlin . 1965: Granted the CVO by the Queen . 1970 - 1974: High commissioner to Canada . 1971: He is knighted for diplomatic services . 1973: Officially, Hayman became retired. 1978: Investigated after leaving a package addressed to him on a bus.It contained 'obscene literature' that was handed to police.

"Fiona Woolf is the second person to be appointed to lead the Government's child abuse inquiry . Fiona Woolf last night faced renewed pressure to stand down as the head of the Government’s child abuse inquiry after victims said they will no longer participate because of her links to Leon Brittan. As evidence emerged of yet more undisclosed meetings between Mrs Woolf and Lord Brittan, a key figure in the scandal, child abuse survivors said they had lost confidence in the inquiry. A lawyer for almost 50 victims said some would now boycott the hearings as they feel they will not be listened to. Lord Brittan is accused of being at the centre of an Establishment cover-up of sex abuse claims in the 1980s – a charge he strenuously denies. It is alleged that, when he was Home Secretary, he ignored a document – which later went missing – that described a paedophile ring involving high-profile figures. Mrs Woolf, who was appointed last month to lead the investigation, wrote a letter to the current Home Secretary, Theresa May, to list her possible conflicts of interests, in which she detailed her contact with Lord Brittan and his wife, including five dinner parties. But yesterday it emerged that Mrs Woolf, who lives in the same street at Lord Brittan, hosted a VIP drinks reception at which he was a guest, which she had not declared in her list. According to a City of London newsletter, Mrs Woolf and Tory peer Lord Brittan were among only a handful of dignitaries to meet the French prime minister at an intimate event in 2011. Andi Lavery, a child abuse victim, said the inquiry was now ‘nonsense’ and called for the home affairs select committee to hold a hearing to listen to survivors’ concerns. He said: ‘This whole process has become an insult and we will not engage with Woolf. Her position is untenable, they have made an absolute mess of this. Survivors who want to be listened to are in despair. This is hurting people. We have a right to a fair hearing, but how can we know we will get this if they [Mrs Woolf and Lord Brittan] go drinking together?’ Mrs Woolf told the home affairs committee she had gone the 'extra distance' to explain her relationship with Lord Brittan - but yesterday it emerged that she hosted a VIP drinks reception at which he was a guest . Last Tuesday, Mrs Woolf, a corporate lawyer, told the home affairs committee: ‘I have gone the extra distance to make sure I have dug out any possible connection [to Lord Brittan].’ Within 24 hours, a photograph emerged that showed Mrs Woolf with Lord Brittan’s wife at an awards ceremony in October 2013, despite Mrs Woolf claiming she had had no social contact with the Brittans since April 2013. Last night Alison Millar, a partner at Leigh Day law firm who represents nearly 50 of the alleged victims, said: ‘Fiona Woolf is a distinguished figure, but rather than bringing any background in child protection to this inquiry, she brings connections to a key figure, Lord Brittan. ‘Some of my more vocal clients have said they feel the correct thing to do is turn their backs on the inquiry as it is. In 1983 Lord Brittan, above, was handed a file that allegedly detailed abuse at the highest levels of Westminster . ‘When many survivors tried to complain about their abuse they have not been listened to, and now they feel the same is happening again. There was a lot of optimism when the inquiry was announced that the authorities wanted to hear and learn lessons. ‘They now feel with the way it’s been set up the establishment does not want to hear too many inconvenient truths.’ Mrs Woolf is the second person to be appointed to lead the inquiry. The first, Baroness Butler-Sloss, was forced to quit because her late brother was the Attorney General at the time of some of the alleged abuse in the 1980s. Mrs Woolf, who is also Lord Mayor of London, did not respond to a request to comment last night.","Victims say they will not participate with inquiry because of Fiona Woolf's links to Leon Brittan .

"A Labour MP who accused former Home Secretary Leon Brittan of ‘improper conduct with children’ was last night defended by a colleague. Jim Hood used a Commons debate on the 1984/5 miners’ strike on Tuesday to suggest that those who took part in the industrial action will not be ‘surprised’ by the allegations against Lord Brittan. The remarks – protected from slander and contempt of court laws by parliamentary privilege – were branded ‘disgusting’ by business minister Matthew Hancock. Lord Brittan, left, home secretary under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, was accused of child abuse in a Commons debate by Labour MP Jim Hood, right . But Simon Danczuk, a campaigner against VIP child abuse, said Mr Hood was right to speak out. The Labour MP for Rochdale added: ‘He has the right to use parliamentary privilege like any other MP.’ Mr Danczuk helped expose the extent of child abuse perpetrated by former Liberal MP Cyril Smith in a book earlier this year. Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, a campaigner against child abuse has backed Mr Hood saying he was right to speak out . Mr Hood’s remarks came amid calls for the head of the official inquiry into historic child sex abuse to resign over links to Lord Brittan. Fiona Woolf has admitted attending dinner parties with the Tory politician, who was in charge of the Home Office in the 1980s. It has been claimed Lord Brittan was handed a file – which is now missing – in 1983 allegedly detailing child abuse at the highest levels of Westminster which he failed to act on. Conservative business minister Matthew Hancock, who branded the remarks by Mr Hood as disgusting . The Peer has strongly denied the claims. Until now, he has not been publicly accused of having played a part in any abuse. The controversial remarks were made during a debate in which MPs accepted a motion which said Margaret Thatcher’s government ‘misled the public’ about pit closure plans during the miners’ strike. Mr Hood, who had been discussing violence on picket lines, said: ‘By the way, the current expose of Sir Leon Brittan, the then home secretary, with accusations of improper conduct with children will not come as a surprise to striking miners of 1984.'

"Simon Danczuk claimed Sir Edward Garnier spoke to him before he was due to give evidence to a committee of MPs this summer . One of David Cameron’s former legal advisers was accused yesterday of trying to discourage a Labour MP from naming Lord Brittan over child abuse allegations. Simon Danczuk, the campaigning Rochdale MP, claimed Sir Edward Garnier spoke to him before he was due to give evidence to a committee of MPs this summer. Mr Danczuk said Sir Edward – who was Solicitor General from 2010 to 2012 – said that ‘challenging Lord Brittan on child abuse would not be a wise move’. The MP made the claims in a Commons debate under Parliamentary privilege, meaning he cannot be sued for libel or face other legal action over what he said. The debate, about the progress of the Government’s overarching inquiry into the handling of child sex abuse allegations by public bodies, also heard from Tory MP Zac Goldsmith who repeated claims that a former Cabinet minister was photographed with a naked boy in the sauna of a guesthouse at the centre of historic child sex abuse allegations. Mr Danczuk told MPs: ‘Earlier this year I told the Home Affairs Select Committee that a dossier containing allegations about child abuse by politicians had been handed by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens to the then home secretary Leon Brittan. 'This revelation helped lead to the Wanless/Whittam review and to the establishment of the overarching inquiry. But not everyone was pleased with the idea that I might challenge Lord Brittan. ‘The night before my appearance at the committee I had an encounter with the right honourable learned member for Harborough [Edward Garnier]. After the 10pm vote he drew me to one side outside the chamber and warned me to think very carefully about what I was going to say the following day. He told me that challenging Lord Brittan on child abuse would not be a wise move and that I might even be responsible for his death as he was unwell. Leon Brittan (left) was Home Secretary from 1983 to 1985, and Mr Danczuk claims that at the time he was sent a dossier of allegations about paedophiles ‘operating and networking within and around Westminster’. Right, Sir Edward Garnier . 'I understand people are cautious about naming parliamentarians but I do think that people who might know about child abuse allegations should answer questions whatever their position. We should not shy away from that.’ Leon Brittan was Home Secretary from 1983 to 1985, and Mr Danczuk claims that at the time he was sent a dossier of allegations by Mr Dickens about paedophiles ‘operating and networking within and around Westminster’. The dossier has never been recovered despite a Home Office inquiry into historic files. The issue will form part of the overarching abuse inquiry which was commissioned by ministers in the summer. In yesterday’s debate Mr Goldsmith claimed that a child protection campaigner had been told by one of the owners of the Elm Guest House, Carol Kasir, that she had photographs of ‘establishment figures’ at the hotel where boys in care had been ‘brought in for sex’. One picture allegedly showed a former Cabinet minister in the sauna with a naked boy, Mr Goldsmith said. But the evidence, along with logbooks, names, times, dates and photographs of Mrs Kasir’s customers simply disappeared after a 1982 police raid on the guesthouse. Mr Goldsmith added: ‘There can no longer be any doubt at all that powerful people have done terrible things and that they have been protected by the establishment.’ Mr Danczuk said earlier: ‘We now know that from at least the 1970s up to the present day there have been people in positions of power who have sexually abused children. Not only this, there have been powerful people willing to cover up this abuse and obstruct justice.’ Sir Edward declined to comment when contacted by the Daily Mail yesterday.","Simon Danczuk, the campaigning Rochdale MP, claimed Sir Edward Garnier spoke to him before he was due to give evidence .

"Crucial Home Office files relating to allegations of  child sex abuse in the 1980s are still missing, it emerged last night. A dossier seen as key to claims ministers were warned about allegations of Establishment abuse as not been found by an inquiry set up to examine the Home Office's handling of the complaints. It was claimed former Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens handed the papers to the Home Office detailing allegations of abuse. NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless has carried out a review into Home Office handling of historic allegations of child abuse . A review into the case by NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless is to be published next week. Mr Dickens, who died in 1995, said he gave details of Establishment paedophiles – known as ‘Dickens dossier’ – to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan in 1983. A source told BBC2's Newsnight: 'They have looked inside and behind every single cupboard in the department, and they have been round them twice, and they have not been able to find any of them.' Former home secretary Lord Brittan has flatly denied failing to deal with a dossier provided by Mr Dickens in 1983 properly, while a review carried out by a HMRC official last year found no evidence that relevant material was not passed to other authorities. But it also disclosed that the Dickens file appeared to have been destroyed - and the permanent secretary at the Home Office, Mark Sedwill, has since revealed that 114 files deemed potentially relevant are missing. MP Simon Danczuk, told the BBC: 'I am worried Peter Wanless has been set up to fail in many respects. 'I don't think he was given enough time to carry out this investigation. I don't think he was provided with enough support within the Home Office and I am worried he didn't get the technological support.' It comes after current Home Secretary Theresa May apologised in the Commons in the wake of the resignation of the second chairwoman appointed to lead a wider inquiry into historic child sex abuse. Former Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens (left), who died in 1995, said he gave details of Establishment paedophiles – known as ‘Dickens dossier’ – to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan (right) in 1983 . Home Secretary Theresa May apologised in the Commons in the wake of the resignation of the second chairwoman appointed to lead a wider inquiry into historic child sex abuse . Fiona Woolf, the Lord Mayor of London, resigned last Friday following disclosures about her links to Lord Brittan, prompting Mrs May to announce the inquiry would have to begin without a chairman next Wednesday. Labour MP John Mann said he was concerned that civil servants who dealt with the dossier at the time had not come forward to give evidence to Mr Wanless because they are forbidden to reveal information about it by the Official Secrets Act. Mr Mann told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I've spoken to a civil servant who saw the file at the time, back in the '80s, and had to sign the Official Secrets Act. Many more did as well, not just in the Home Office. 'While I understand the file is really a list of names and not much more than that, I've also spoken to a journalist who's still alive today - Don Hale - who was given a list of names, but more importantly a whole series of Home Office minutes of meetings looking into this issue, by the late Barbara Castle. 'All those files very quickly - a couple of days after he was given them by Barbara Castle - were seized by the security services and Special Branch. 'This information came to light to me after Wanless had finished his work.' Asked if he was impressed by Mr Wanless's investigation, Mr Mann said: 'It doesn't seem to me it's getting anywhere near asking the questions. 'If one civil servant saw the file, and says many others did as well, and doesn't want to speak out because of the restrictions of the Official Secrets Act, then that's what Wanless needed to be asking questions about.' He added: 'I'm aware of some of the names. They are not all household names. The well-known ones, it's inconceivable that there wouldn't be interest from the intelligence services, because they could be blackmailed. It would be improper for the Home Office not to pass that on at the time. 'There are ongoing police investigations into some of these people. I'm aware of at least seven prominent people where there are ongoing live police investigations, and there are other names given where there's not in my view sufficient evidence in themselves to launch anything other than asking around. 'With a number of them, victims have come forward and they are very prominent people. So the issue is not going to go away. 'There are civil servants, maybe retired now, who do know a lot and they have not come forward to Wanless, and that's a problem.'","NSPCC Peter Wanless led review of Home Office handling of abuse claims .

"A paedophile was given access to children’s homes to advise the Home Office about child care reforms, it was claimed yesterday. Peter Righton, who later co-founded a pro-paedophilia campaign group, interviewed vulnerable children as he researched a government report. The academic had already left a teaching job over complaints of child sex abuse and went on to be a founding member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE). Peter Righton - a founding member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) - advised the Home Office on a report which led to the reform of Britain's children's home, it emerged today . The 1970 . report, authored by a Home Office advisory committee, credited him for . his ‘considerable assistance’ in a chapter on training for children’s . home workers. At . the time Righton was considered a leading expert on social work . training and was the former director of education at the National . Institute for Social Work and a consultant for the National Children’s . Bureau charity. Righton was later arrested and fined £900 for importing . child abuse images in 1992 and was cautioned for an earlier assault. He . died in 2007, aged 81. A . former care professional, who asked not to be identified, said . Righton’s work on the Home Office report had allowed him to ‘network’ at . children’s homes, previously known as approved schools. Righton is said to have visited care homes and schools around the UK, including Bryn Estyn in Wrexham, where 'appalling' abuse was later uncovered involving 140 former residents . He carried out research across Britain, including visits to homes in Stoke-on-Trent, Rochdale and Preston. The . retired worker told Radio 4’s Today: ‘He [used to] go and interview, in . approved schools, individual boys and he certainly went to speak to the . heads of homes.’ He added: ‘He was a very dangerous man because he was . put in a position where he could abuse trust.’ The . former care worker said Righton had visited the Bryn Estyn approved . school in Wrexham and claimed he ‘took boys out’ and used ‘sexual’ language. Bryn Estyn was later hit by a scandal in which 140 former . residents alleged they were abused between 1974 and 1984. An . official report detailed ‘appalling’ abuse and former housemaster Peter . Howarth was jailed for ten years for abusing boys as young as 12. He . died in jail. Howarth had previously taught at the same school in Kent . where Righton had faced a child abuse complaint. The complaint did not . lead to criminal charges and Righton’s paedophilia did not appear to be . known when he was working on the Home Office committee report. But . by the mid-1970s he had become a founding member of the PIE, which . lobbied for sex between adults and children to be decriminalised. The . Oxford-educated academic was later arrested over child abuse images and a . search of his home revealed documents said to include evidence of a . wide-reaching paedophile network. When . Labour MP Tom Watson called for an inquiry into Righton in 2011 police . interest in allegations involving the Elm Guest House – a hotel in . London where children from a home in Hounslow were reportedly brought to . have sex with adult men – was reignited.

"If you cry at sad scenes in films, tweet and post emotional links and jump to help the less fortunate, you could be genetically predisposed to 'sensory processing sensitivity', researchers say. California researchers have found that up to 20% of people are affected, having a highly sensitive brain that responds to emotional images. The researchers used fMRI scans to monitor the level of empathy - and say the emotion levels are particularly high if pictures of partners smiling are shown. Scroll down for video . Researchers have found that up to 20% of people have a highly sensitive brain that responds to emotional images. Highly sensitive people tend to show heightened awareness to subtle stimuli, process information more thoroughly, and be more reactive to both positive and negative stimuli, the researchers say. Roughly 20 percent of the population is affected by sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), an innate trait associated with greater sensitivity, or responsiveness, to environmental and social stimuli. Highly sensitive people tend to show heightened awareness to subtle stimuli, process information more thoroughly, and be more reactive to both positive and negative stimuli, the researchers say. In contrast, the majority of people have comparatively low SPS and pay less attention to subtle stimuli, approach situations more quickly and are not as emotionally reactive. Stony Brook University psychologists Arthur and Elaine Aron say roughly 20 percent of the population is affected by sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), an innate trait associated with greater sensitivity, or responsiveness, to environmental and social stimuli. In a new study published in Brain and Behavior, Drs. Aron and colleagues at the University of California, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and Monmouth University found that Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of brains provide physical evidence that the 'highly sensitive' brain responds powerfully to emotional images. According to Dr. Arthur Aron, the trait is becoming increasingly associated with identifiable behaviors, genes, physiological reactions, and patterns of brain activation. Highly sensitive people tend to show heightened awareness to subtle stimuli, process information more thoroughly, and be more reactive to both positive and negative stimuli, the researchers say. In contrast, the majority of people have comparatively low SPS and pay less attention to subtle stimuli, approach situations more quickly and are not as emotionally reactive.Drs. Aron and colleagues used fMRI brain scans to compare HSPs with  low SPS individuals. The analysis is the first with fMRI to demonstrate how HSPs’ brain activity processes others’ emotions. The brains of 18 married individuals (some with high and some with low SPS) were scanned as they viewed photos of either smiling faces, or sad faces. One set of photos included the faces of strangers, and the other set included photos of their husbands or wives. 'We found that areas of the brain involved with awareness and emotion, particularly those areas connected with empathetic feelings, in the highly sensitive people showed substantially greater blood flow to relevant brain areas than was seen in individuals with low sensitivity during the twelve second period when they viewed the photos,” said Dr. Aron, a Research Professor in Psychology at Stony Brook. Sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), an innate trait associated with greater sensitivity, or responsiveness, to environmental and social stimuli, affects 20% of people, researchers say They are more likely to cry at sad scenes in films such as Titanic, (pictured) A comparison of the brains of highly sensitive people (HSP) compared to non-HSPs. The areas in color represent some of the regions of the brain where greater activation occurs in HSPs compared to non-HSPs. The brain region highly associated with empathy and noticing emotion (Anterior Insula) shows significantly greater activation in HSPs than non-HSPs when viewing a photo of their partner smiling. 'This is physical evidence within the brain that highly sensitive individuals respond especially strongly to social situations that trigger emotions, in this case of faces being happy or sad.' The brain activity was even higher when HSPs viewed the expressions of their spouses. The highest activation occurred when viewing images of their partner as happy. Most of the participants were scanned again one year later, and the same results occurred. Areas of the brain indicating the greatest activity – as shown by blood flow – include sections known as the 'mirror neuron system,' an area strongly associated with empathetic response and brain areas associated with awareness, processing sensory information and action planning. Dr. Aron believes the results provide further evidence that HSPs are generally highly tuned into their environment. He said the new findings via the fMRI provide evidence that especially high levels of awareness and emotional responsiveness are fundamental features of humans characterized as HSPs.","Researchers used fMRI scans to monitor the level of empathy .

"A VIP paedophile ring allegedly abused children at the The Elm Guest House in London . A former cabinet minister was photographed with a naked boy in the sauna of a guesthouse at the centre of historic child sex abuse allegations, an MP has said. Tory Zac Goldsmith claimed that a child protection campaigner had been told by one of the owners of the Elm Guest House, Carol Kasir, that she had photographs of 'establishment figures' at the hotel where boys in care had been 'brought in for sex'. But the evidence, along with logbooks, names, times, dates and photographs of Mrs Kasir's customers simply disappeared after a 1982 police raid on the guesthouse. Mr Goldsmith said evidence from 12 boys alleging abuse had also 'evaporated' and Mrs Kasir and her husband Haroon were eventually given suspended sentences for 'running a disorderly house'. Mrs Kasir then died a few years later in 'very odd circumstances', he said. In a backbench debate on the progress of the Government's inquiry into historic child sex abuse, Mr Goldsmith told the Commons: 'When Mrs Kasir died a few years after the house was raided in very odd circumstances, a child protection campaigner from the National Association of Young People in Care called for a criminal investigation into events at Elm Guest House. 'He said that he'd been told by Mrs Kasir that boys had been brought in from the local children's home [...] for sex. 'And that she had all kinds of photographs of establishment figures at her hotel. One of them allegedly showed a former cabinet minister in the sauna with a naked boy. 'She had logbooks, names, times, dates, pictures of her customers and so on. All that evidence simply disappeared after the raid. It no longer exists. That surely is astonishing.' It comes after Scotland Yard was urged to investigate ‘grotesque’ claims police helped to ‘cover up’ the death of an eight-year-old boy at the hands of a Westminster paedophile ring. Vishambar Mehrotra claims his son Vishal was murdered by a Westminster-based abusers after disappearing on the day of the Royal wedding in 1981. He said a male prostitute told him he was taken to the Elm Guest House where high-profile abusers attacked children.

Mr Mehota recorded the conversation but when he presented police with the evidence, Scotland Yard ‘pooh poohed’ it and failed to investigate, he alleged. Vishal disappeared while walking back to his home in Putney after a family day trip to watch the celebrations for Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding on July 29, 1981. He had been walking a few hundred yards ahead of his family members and vanished less than a mile from his home. It was almost a year before his remains were found in isolated woodland in West Sussex in February 1982. Dolphin Square, where boys are said to have been taken for sex sessions in the 1970s and 1980s . He was missing his legs, pelvis and lower spine - and much of his clothing, including his Superman underpants were also gone. Four months after Vishal’s body was found, police raided Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London, and questioned dozens of men including a number of high profile individuals. Earlier this month, another victim came forward alleging to have witnessed the murder of three boys including one who was strangled by a Conservative MP during a sex game. The Metropolitan Police announced last week that it is investigating the possibility of murders linked to the Elm Guest House. In May 1983, as police wound up the inquiry into Vishal Mehrotra’s death. West Sussex coroner Mark Calvert Lee recorded an open verdict at an inquest but said he believed ‘foul play’ was likely. The owners of the Elm Guest House, Carole and Harry Kasir, were fined £1,000 each and given suspended nine-month sentences at the Old Bailey but were found not guilty of running a brothel. Mrs Kasir - who killed herself in 1990 - later admitted to child protection officers that children from the council-run Grafton Close Children’s Home had been taken to the brothel and gave them names of people who had visited the guesthouse. The late Liberal MP Cyril Smith is one public figure widely alleged to have abused children from Grafton Close at the Elm Guest House. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the force was ‘not in a position to comment’ about Mr Mehota’s claims. Allegations of a VIP paedophile ring 30 years ago are being investigated by Scotland Yard through Operation Fairbank, launched two years.

The London club's annual accounts have been lodged at Companies House and reveal that Chelsea's wage bill for the 2013/14 season was £190.5million, up eight per cent from £176m. United are currently the biggest payers in English football, shelling out a total £214.8m on salaries while City's wage bill dropped last season to £205m. Jose Mourinho has plenty to shout about with Chelsea paying their players less than their Manchester rivals . Diego Costa was one of five players signed by Chelsea in the summer for a combined £62m . Juan Mata moved from Chelsea to Manchester United as the Blues made room for new signings . The sale of David Luiz to Paris Saint Germain ensured there was only a small rise in the overall wage bill . Arsenal are next in the pay league with a total wage bill of £166.4m while the scale of Southampton's success on the pitch is illustrated by the fact that their wage bill was a fraction of their rivals - the latest figures available for 2012/13 show the Saints, currently third in the Premier League, paid out just £47.1m in salaries. Chelsea's accounts confirm the club's announcement in November that they made a £18.4m profit last season - but shows this was helped by a £65m profit in player trading thanks to the sales of Juan Mata to United, David Luiz to Paris St Germain and Kevin de Bruyne to Wolfsburg. It allowed the club to overturn a £49.4m loss on the season before and should make them assured to comply with UEFA's financial fair play rules. Chelsea's accounts show broadcasting income increased by £34m to £139m, due to the new Premier League television deal plus the benefits of being Champions League semi-finalists, while commercial income also showed a big rise, up £29m to £108m. Turnover overall was up £64m to £319.8m. The accounts say five new players brought in by Jose Mourinho since June 30 2014 - including Diego Costa and Filipe Luis - cost £62m with £19.6m coming in for players who were sold.","Chelsea have a wage bill of £190m for the 2013/14 season .

"When he floated the giant online shopping company he founded on Wall St for $22billion, Alibaba's Jack Ma was catapulted into the public eye in the West. But, while investors in America were getting their first glimpse of Ma, 50, a study of him in his native China reveals a larger-than-life figure who performs karaoke on stage for thousands of his employees - and even marries them. Ma, who founded Alibaba from a tiny flat in China in 1999, showed some of his personality to investors as the company floated, declaring on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange that his hero was Forrest Gump. Scroll down for video . Rock star entrepreneur: Jack Ma appeared onstage at a company event dressed in leathers, shades and a wig to the sounds of Disney's The Lion King . Suited, then booted: Ma, left at an investors' meeting in Singapore, sang You Are So Beautiful to thousands of cheering employees to celebrate a company anniversary . But back on Chinese soil the man behind the internet giant, which, dwarfs Facebook and Amazon with its $230billion valuation and has reportedly made him China's richest man, lives an even more bizarre lifestyle. New footage of the billionaire on home soil, taken by CBS's 60 Minutes over the past year, shows Ma appearing on stage in glam rock gear in front of massive crowds, as well as conducting mass wedding celebrations for more than 700 of his employees. According to Ma himself - who seemed bemused to discover this is not typical CEO behavior - it is all to boost the happiness of his employees, who adore him and crowd round for photos at every opportunity. At one point, the businessman is pictured in outlandish punk rock gear, including a leather jacket, sunglasses, nose jewelry, a white wig and a, red mohawk-style headdress serenading a huge crowd to celebrate a company anniversary. After entering the stage to the theme tune from Disney's Lion King movie, he is later heard singing You Are So Beautiful - to rapturous applause. Ma, who saw the internet for the first time in 1995, and returned to China determined to make it a viable business there, has made his company the biggest online retailer on earth, and himself one of China's most powerful men. Cult of Ma? The company founder, now worth $14billion, is pictured above at a wedding event for his own employees, attended by hundreds of cheering Ma enthusiasts . I <3 U: Ma (center on stage) has said the 2003 SARs epidemic in China inspired him to start the weird ceremonies - and urged US company chiefs to follow suit . Cheering: Fans wave their hands and take pictures of the businessman, who is a celebrity in China . Brought together by Alibaba: This couple embrace one another at the Ma-sponsored event . It is a far cry from his humble beginnings, where had grew up in rural Hangzhou with not enough to eat, and failed two college entrance exams in his hometown. Before he came up with the idea to found Alibaba, he taught English, but was rejected for more than a dozen other jobs, including a post at KFC. The online retailer smashed records with its offering - the largest in US history - and is now as valuable as Facebook after its first day on Wall Street. The e-commerce powerhouse, which sells anything from fat suits to live animals, started the day valued more than Amazon and eBay at $168 billion, and sent tremors through the market as it floated stocks priced at $68 per share. Shares quickly jumped to $98 once trading finally launched at 11.53am - after a delayed start due to an overwhelming influx of orders. He's here! Ma, pictured above in his company headquarters, is constantly asked to pose for photographs with employees . Card sharp: Jack Ma also showed off his prowess by performing card tricks for CBS . Now, the firm is worth $230 billion - more than Facebook - as stocks closed at $93, up 38 per cent. Ma also revealed another bizarre tradition at the company - mass wedding celebrations for his employees, which bring together as many as 700 couples for a huge celebration. The founder is filmed marching onto a pink stage, surrounded by heart motifs and a giant screen, congratulating his employees on their marriages as they film him on smartphones and tablets, cheering at every opportunity. When told that American CEOs are not in the habit of presiding over weddings, Ma told his interviewer: 'They should learn - and they should make their employees happy.' He said the tradition stems from the 2003 outbreak of SARs in China, when he and many of his employees were quarantined for more than a week. Past: Ma, pictured above as a child, came from humble beginnings and didn't have enough to eat growing up . Master pitch: Ma founded Alibaba in 1999, and is pictured above convincing original investors to make a bet on the internet - then practically unknown in his homeland . Ma said that his relief on being allowed to leave made him appreciate living so much he started throwing parties for his workers. He said he told himself: 'Life is so short, so beautiful - don't be so serious about the work, enjoy the lifes [sic].' Ma himself is thought to have made some $14billion - enough to put him in the 71st spot on Forbes' list of global billionaires, ahead of media mogul Rupert Murdoch ($13.5billion) and fashion designer Giorgio Armani ($9.9billion). In 15 years the firm has risen from a start-up in an apartment 100 miles outside the city of Shanghai to become a juggernaut bigger than Hewlett Packard. Welcome to Wall Street: Alibaba made $22billion by floating around 10 per cent of its stock on the NYSE this month. Ma is pictured above ringing the bell to start the trading . Among the rich and famous: Ma's wealth has propelled him into the ranks of entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg . Alibaba is based in Hangzhou in Eastern China, Ma's hometown. The company got started in 1999 when Ma and 17 friends developed a fledgling e-commerce company on the cusp of the Internet boom. Ma, who founded the company in a one-bedroom apartment, will have a paper fortune worth some $14 billion, vaulting him into the ranks of tech billionaires like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. Alibaba has been described as China's answer to eBay, but it actually handles more packages annually than eBay and Amazon combined. Investors hope a stake in the firm will give them exposure to China's rapid-growth internet sector. The stock started trading on on September 19 under the ticker 'BABA' on the NYSE. As part of the so-called roadshow, would-be investors heard a sales pitch that centered on Alibaba's strong revenue growth and seemingly endless possibilities for expansion, which led to stocks closing at $93, indicating an overall valuation of a huge $230billion. The website, which aims to connect companies with wholesalers, is known for selling everything - including some strange offerings. One company in particular, Zhongshan City Elephant Sculpture Art, is leading the way with its silicone-wax celebrity statues. A popular piece is the life-size, obese statue of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The sculpture is completely naked, apart from shotgun and sunglasses, and it could be yours for £9,900 ($16,800). In the event you need the services of a camel, then you can purchase 500 for around £350 ($600) each. With many of the items bulk buy, your will need to order 24,000 pieces to get your hand on what is described as 'lovely used panties'.

"Mick Jagger’s age could help him win him an £8 million insurance payout over the death of L’Wren Scott, a legal expert has claimed. The Rolling Stones singer, 71, is not as spritely as he was and could have become overcome with grief more easily after discovering his girlfriend killed herself. Contracts expert Zev Eigen said that the bar that would stop Jagger performing would be ‘much lower’ than if he were a younger man. Scroll down for video . L'Wren Scott's death prompted the Rolling Stones to postpone a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand, but their insurers are battling with the band to not pay out for losses. But Jagger's age may affect the case . He described Mr Jagger’s age as an ‘interesting wrinkle’ in the case that could hand him victory. The Stones are locked in a bitter legal battle with the 12 underwriting companies who say Scott’s death is not covered by their policy because she took her own life. Lawsuits have been filed at the High Court in London and in New York and Utah and Miss Scott’s entire medical history could be made public if the cases go to trial. The papers also revealed for the first time that Mr Jagger was diagnosed with acute traumatic stress disorder, an extreme mental reaction, when told Miss Scott, hanged herself on March 17. The Stones say he was told by his doctor not to perform for at least 30 days whilst he dealt with the condition, which can cause nightmares and flashbacks, meaning they had to put off shows in Australia and New Zealand. Mr Eigen, a visiting professor at NYC Law School, told the New York Daily News: ‘The insurance contract is for his performance, not hers. Jagger was 'diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder' after Scott's death . ‘And given his advanced age, there's a greater range of things that reasonably could affect his stamina, stress-level and ability to perform. The bar is much lower than it would be for a 21-year-old. ‘This contract was about his ability to get on stage and perform demanding physical feats. ‘Sure he's spry and awesome for a 71-year-old, but there's simply a greater range of things that could prevent someone his age from performing’. An autopsy confirmed Miss Scott’s death was ruled a suicide after she was found in her luxury Manhattan apartment. The designer’s fashion business was £4.6 million into debt and there was speculation she and Mr Jagger had broken up, though his spokesman denied this. The Stones’ insurance policy was for up to £15 million and the tour was expected to make £28 million. A clause says that if they extended it by another 14 shows to include Europe, which they did, then the total revenue would rise to £61 million. In the High Court papers, however the insurers argue that because Miss Scott’s death was not ‘sudden and unforeseen’ or ‘beyond her control’ they should not pay up. They suggest that she could have been suffering from a mental condition beforehand that played a part in her actions. Professor Elgin told the New York Daily News that he thought the Stones would settle as the band would be ‘loath’ to hand over more personal information to the insurers’ lawyers. Lawyers for the insurers, who are based in London, did not return calls for comment. Nobody for the Stones was available for comment. The disclosure is the most revealing insight yet into Jagger’s feelings. He has so far given only one brief interview about Miss Scott’s suicide. In a statement, he said he would ‘never forget her’, adding: ‘I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way.’ The eight insurers are led by Cathedral Capital and Talbot 2002 Underwriting Capital Limited, both based in London. They responded by claiming that Miss Scott’s death was not ‘sudden and unforeseen’ or ‘beyond her control’ and so did not qualify for a payout. They also claimed it was ‘reasonable to infer Miss Scott had been suffering from a mental illness’ that was ‘traceable to, or accelerated by, a condition for which she had received or been recommended medical attention’. A pre-existing condition of this kind could affect any payout. The insurers appeared to dispute the idea that Jagger was so deeply upset, and claimed that the doctor who diagnosed him had not actually carried out an examination. They wrote: ‘It does not appear that Sir Mick Jagger was assessed at any time by a qualified psychiatrist or anyone else suitably qualified with sufficient expertise to make a diagnosis of acute stress disorder.’ Court documents revealed that Jagger has 18 people on his insurance policy, including Ms Scott, Jerry Hall, seven children and four grandchildren . The Rolling Stones frontman published a statement on his website soon after  L'Wren Scott's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life . The only proof they had seen was a letter from a doctor, who was not a psychiatrist and did not actually see the patient, the papers state. Last month, the insurers filed a lawsuit in New York’s Federal Court, and subpoenaed Adam Glassman, the executor of Scott’s will, the New York City medical examiner, and Brittany Penebre, her British assistant, in an attempt to gain access to any emails or messages about an ‘actual or alleged attempt at self harm by Miss Scott’ as well as her general mental health, or an ‘actual or alleged suicide attempt’. Meanwhile in Utah, where Miss Scott grew up, a judge has ruled that the insurers will be allowed to seek documents and testimony from Miss Scott’s brother, Randall Bambrough, to find out more about her mental state. However, Mr Bambrough told a local newspaper that he had yet to receive a summons. Miss Scott, a fashion designer and model, was 49 when her body was found in her Manhattan apartment by Miss Penebre. An autopsy confirmed her death was suicide. Her fashion business had been £4.6million in debt and she had abruptly cancelled her show at London Fashion Week, supposedly due to technical difficulties. There were also reports she and Jagger had split up, leaving her ‘devastated’, although Jagger’s spokesman denied this. Documents filed at the district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, reveal Miss Scott was on a long list of family on the Stones’ insurance policy. Also on Jagger’s list were his ex-wives Jerry Hall and Bianca Jagger, former girlfriends, seven children and four grandchildren. The documents give a fascinating insight into how the insurance policy worked. The revenue for the tour was expected to be £28million, and this could have gone up if 15 extra European dates were added. The insurers agreed to pay out up to 50 per cent in case of tragedy. A spokesman for the Rolling Stones declined to comment. Lawyers for the insurers did not return calls for comment. Hell-raisers: Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards . The Rolling Stones may still be going strong, but their court documents reveal that their disgruntled insurers are well aware of the toll taken by years of the rockstar lifestyle. Hidden among the fine print of their tour insurance policy is a long list of exceptions – health issues for which each member of the ageing band is not covered. For example, and perhaps not surprisingly, the insurers say they will not pay out if anything happens to guitarist Keith Richards related to ‘alcohol abuse, liver failure and/or disease and osteoarthritis’. More unusually, anything to do with the injury that he suffered in 2006, when he was hit on the head by a coconut, will not be covered either. For Ronnie Wood, anything to do with ‘alcohol abuse’ is also not covered. The exemptions for drummer Charlie Watts include any conditions related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004 or his sciatica. The documents show the band expected to receive £28million for their tour. Just three shows in Japan were worth £9million.","Jagger diagnosed with traumatic stress disorder after L'Wren Scott died .

"It's the new party craze that will make nutritionists despair. Teenagers are ordering dozens of cartons of McDonald's French fries, spreading them in a giant pile across the table on trays and then digging right in. They then take pictures of their 'potato party' and post them on Facebook, Twitter and blogs to show the world they aren't afraid of carbohydrates, or fat, or salt. It started in Japan when McDonald's ran a promotion that meant all French fry sizes were £1 but has arrived in Korea and is spreading West-ward. Scroll down for video . 'Potato Parties', where teens order vast volumes of French fries, is a bizarre new internet food fad in the Far East . For reasons unknown, a group of Japanese teens ordered 23 large portions, upended the containers onto serving trays and took pictures before diving in. The pictures of the unusual dining experience quickly went viral and copycats started holding their own potato parties and uploading their own pictures. One group in the centre of Okayama, a city in the south of Japan, ordered a staggering sixty portions of large fries. Temper: The South Korean teenagers annoyed the staff at this McDonald's and were asked to leave . The group even commemorated their pigging out session with a specially printed pink balloon. According to Kotaku, the group ate every single last one - a total of around 30,000 calories. Now Potato Parties have made the leap to South Korea. A group of Korean youngsters reportedly bought £165 worth of French fries and filled 16 service trays for their feast, enraging the restaurant's staff, who ordered the 'brats' to 'stop causing trouble' and 'get out of here', according to Gawker. Someone claiming to be an employee of that McDonald's tweeted the person who posted the photo: 'Please stop, please stop'. The supposed employee added that other customers had complained that the French fry eating went on for three hours, while people watching blocked the walkway, inconveniencing other patrons. Social media users in the two countries were not impressed. Some said the stunt is rude and disrespectful to the low-wage workers expected to clear it up, while others felt the teenagers were wasting food. 'Look, buying 23 large French fries is fine, but you gotta eat them all, you gotta eat every last one,' tweeted one individual. One user, Zane McCarty, was a bit more scathing. He said: 'Well, when they die of heart failure, at least there will be less stupid people to populate the earth.' But erischild said: 'They paid for the food, they shouldn't be kicked out. They're going to suffer anyway when those fries are on the way out.' Paul Greene concurs: 'They paid for the fries and it doesn't look like they are having a wild party. 'Some people should really just calm down.' A spokeswoman for McDonald's said that she was not aware of any the bizarre dining rituals being held in the UK. She said: 'I've never heard of these parties' Gluttony: In one Potato Party, Japanese teens bought 60 cartons and dug in, demolishing the lot . Asian news site RocketNews24 wrote . that not only is the craze wildly unhealthy, they also keep other . customers from enjoying their food. 'Not only do these hefty fry orders . cause every other customer's food to be delayed,' the site writes, 'the . rambunctious teenagers smugly eating their fries disturb the other . customers eating at the restaurant.

"Metropolitan Police Chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the number of people arriving in Britain was causing a strain as newcomers 'find it difficult to integrate' Mass migration to Britain has left police forces ‘struggling to cope’, the country’s top officer warned last night. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said that the large number of people arriving in Britain was causing a strain because they found it ‘difficult to integrate’. The Scotland Yard chief told a law enforcement conference in New York: ‘What joins New York and London is that we’ve seen growth and with growth there is migration as an element of that. ‘All it means is that for the police to have community-based policing sometimes it can be more difficult to integrate with new populations. ‘People arrive with different languages, people arrive having different perceptions of police officers, so that in itself can be quite a challenge. ‘And in London we know that 25 per cent of the population growth of the United Kingdom arrived in London over the last ten years. We’ve all seen growth but not at the pace that we’ve seen it more recently. ‘So it’s just a simple logistical point that the more people arrive, the more quickly they arrive, all our bureaucracies struggle to cope with that, and the police are no different. Sir Bernard has repeatedly highlighted the challenges faced by the criminal justice system in the face of foreign offenders. Earlier this year he said how more than half of all foreign criminals have a right to stay, which prevents them being deported. He warned that the police and other agencies are not adapting quickly enough to cope with the impact of immigration. Police still struggle to obtain fast information on foreign suspects, such as Latvian convicted murdered Arnis Zalkalns - the prime suspect in the Alice Gross murder who has since killed himself . A third of crimes in the capital are committed by foreign offenders but the majority are EU citizens who may have the freedom to live and travel between member states. There have been repeated calls for the police to do more to stop those banned from Britain getting in and to kick out those who should no longer be here. Police still struggle to obtain fast and accurate information on foreign suspects, which was highlighted in the recent murder of teenager Alice Gross. Officers discovered Latvian prime suspect Arnis Zalkans, who later killed himself, was a convicted murderer who had repeatedly travelled to the UK.","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe warned police 'struggle to cope' with immigration .

"The families of Thailand murder victims Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have been invited to help secure death sentences for the suspects despite widespread doubts over whether police have caught the real killers. Justice officials said the grieving parents can team up with prosecutors to file joint murder charges against two Burmese migrant workers accused of the brutal killings of the  backpackers on a Thai beach. The quirk of Thai law means murder victims’ families can hire lawyers and investigators who could turn up additional evidence or testimony. Scroll down for video . The families of the Thai murder victims have been asked to secure death sentences for two Burmese workers arrested for their deaths (pictured) However, such cases are rare because of the hefty costs. The offer was made by the prosecutor in charge of the case, Thawatchai Siangjaew, who said he had arranged a video conference via the British embassy in Thailand to ‘inform the victims’ parents of their legal rights’. Winning the families’ support would lend credibility to the heavily criticised police case against Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, who say they were tortured into confessing. The pair, who admit they were drinking beer and playing guitar near the murder scene on Koh Tao island on the night of the September 15 killings, could be sentenced to die by lethal injection if they are convicted. British police are preparing to fly out to the island and are expected to focus on securing independent checks on the DNA samples of the two suspects. Meanwhile, there is mounting scepticism over the guilt of the suspects among fellow workers. Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were brutally murdered on the island of Koh Tao in Thailand this summer . The backpackers' bodies were found in the surf on Sairee Beach (pictured) in the early hours of the morning . Construction worker Win Tun Tun, 40, who shared a room with Zaw Lin, said he was convinced his friend was innocent. He said: ‘I saw him the morning after the murders and he was perfectly normal. I can’t believe he is involved.’ Other colleagues said they were convinced the pair had been framed to cover for the real killers, who they suspect are Thais connected to the island’s controlling families.","Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were murdered in Koh Tao, Thailand .

"David Lowe, who was sacked after he played an old version of The Sun Has Got Its Hat On, claims the show was pre-recorded - but no one at the BBC approved it for transmission before it was played . A BBC DJ who was sacked after playing a song containing the N-word has said his show was pre-recorded - but no one at the corporation approved it for broadcast. David Lowe, 68, lost his job after playing a 1932 version of The Sun Has Got His Hat On during his Sunday night show on BBC Radio Devon. The version contains the line: ‘He’s been tanning n****** out in Timbuktu, now he’s coming back to do the same to you.’ Following the broadcast, Mr Lowe immediately offered to apologise on air for his error - but the corporation ordered Mr Lowe to 'fall on his sword' after just one listener complained. Today, Mr Lowe has said the show was pre-recorded - but it not approved for transmission by station managers as required by the BBC's compliance system. Furthermore, Mr Lowe claimed the offending song was still on the . BBC's system almost two weeks after his show was aired. The DJ said the incident highlighted how the process - which was tightened following the so-called Sachsgate scandal in 2008 - needed 'scrapping or completely rethinking.' The 'Sachsgate' saga was when presenter Jonathan Ross and comedian Russell Brand left a series of lewd messages on the answerphone of Faulty Towers actor Andrew Sachs. The show was pre-recorded and therefore should have been checked by station managers at BBC Radio 2. Brand and Lesley Douglas, controller of the station, resigned from the BBC following the scandal - and the corporation was fined by Ofcom. Mr Lowe played a 1932 version of the son, performed by Amrbose & His Orchestra, on a Sunday night golden oldies show . Today, a BBC spokesman confirmed Mr Lowe's show was recorded in advance, but it was categorised as a 'low risk'. Mr Lowe told The Telegraph he would record his shows six days before they were due to be broadcast. He described how he would upload the audio along with the compliance forms to the station's internal system well in advance. Mr Lowe says the system requires a broadcaster to nominate someone in BBC management to listen to the show. BBC spokesman confirmed Mr Lowe's show was recorded in advance today, but it was categorised as  'low risk'. However, Mr Lowe says when he went to check if his show had been approved two days prior to broadcast, it had not been listened to. He told the newspaper: 'I immediately emailed the managing editor and said ""I see it has not been approved, we are getting a bit close for comfort."" 'He immediately came back to me and said ""Ok, I will deal with that"". I said ""Thanks a lot"" and forgot about it. The . lyrics to The Sun Has Got His Hat On have been changed several times . since Noel Gay (above) and Ralph Butler wrote the original in 1932. It . was composed for the musical Me And My Girl and first recorded by the . Henry Hall BBC Dance Orchestra, with vocals by Val Rosing. The second verse went: ‘He’s been tanning n*****s out in Timbuktu, Now he’s coming back to do the same for you.’ Jonathan King, who was jailed in 2001 for sexually abusing teenagers in the 1980s, covered the song in 1971. He changed the lyric to: ‘He’s been tanning negroes in Timbuktu.’ More . recent versions have changed it to: ‘He’s been roastin’ peanuts out in . Timbuktu’ or just ‘shining brightly out  in Timbuktu’. 'When I went back into the compliance form again on the Monday evening after transmission, I noticed the programme was still pending – in other words, it had not been approved for transmission.' A BBC spokeswoman said today: 'His weekly show was categorised as low risk and therefore did not require complex sign off procedures. 'The key point remains that we should not have accepted his resignation.' After the show was broadcast on April 27, friends and colleagues rallied to support Mr Lowe. Others accused the BBC of double standards for allowing Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson to keep his job after mumbling the N-word in an outtake of his motoring show. Mr Lowe offered to apologise on air for the mistake - but BBC executives asked him not to mention the slip-up. They then asked if they could announce he wanted to leave to ‘pursue other interests’. Emma Clements, BBC Devon’s acting editor, eventually wrote to him saying: ‘I agree you have acted properly throughout and we are grateful for both your apology and your appreciation of the seriousness of the situation. 'But regrettably, I think we will have to accept your offer to fall on your sword to resolve this situation.’ Mr Lowe's former boss at BBC Radio . Devon Roy Corlett, said at the time: ‘To end David’s career in this way . when Clarkson was given a rap on the knuckles is absolutely appalling. It is an outrageous way to treat a loyal and distinguished employee. You . couldn’t wish to meet a nicer man.’ Another . former Radio Devon station manager, John Lilley, added: ‘It is a tragic . end to a 32-year career with the BBC.

"A fast food 'superhero' who delivers McDonald's to customers has won a battle with the fast food chain to be allowed inside their restaurants. Paul Appleby - who goes by the name 'Munchie Man' - launched a new business taking orders for McDonald's customers who don't want to pick it up for themselves. The 41-year-old from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, delivers it to to his customers - who pay £4.50 for the service - in his 'Munchies Van' which has equipment inside to keep the food warm. To the rescue: Munchie Man Paul Appleby delivers McDonald's to customers who don't want to collect it . Paul managed 45 successful deliveries on his first weekend before he got banned from McDonald's - who said they had concerns over food safety. Paul said: 'We were really busy on the Friday and Saturday night, until McDonald's just stopped serving us. They wouldn't let us in.' McDonalds has issued a statement saying the firm had looked into running its own delivery service but decided against it because it would mean the quality of the food would suffer. A McDonald's spokesperson said: 'We found that a delivery service would not be able to adequately meet our quality commitment to serving hot, freshly prepared food every time to off-site locations. 'We are therefore not in a position to support other delivery ventures in the UK as we could not guarantee this quality commitment to our customers.' McDonald's in Barnsley tried to stop Paul from delivering his orders by refusing to serve him - but have now relented him . Bringing home the burgers: Paul Appleby spent £5,000 setting up the business . The statement also said it would refuse to give licence for the use on McDonald's 'intellectual property' such as logos and photographs. But after Paul pleaded with them, McDonald's saying he is now welcome to use the Barnsley outlets. Paul said 'They've said I'm welcome in all their restaurants, so I'm hoping this can really grow now. I want a Munchies Van every ten miles.' Customers can order and pay for their food on Munchie Man's website then Paul goes to buy it and delivers it to the customer - adding a delivery charge of £4.50. Another happy customer: In his first weekend of operating, Paul managed 45 successful deliveries . The ultimate fast food: Customers don't even have to leave their homes to get fast-food . Paul said he has spent £5,000 setting up the delivery business and website. The food is placed in a specially designed heat bag at the restaurant - it is then placed into an insulated heated area within his van, and handed to the customer. Paul said: 'It's kept above 63 degrees - which is the required temperature. Comments from customers are that it's hotter than when you pick it up yourself. 'I never handle the food, but I've done my basic food hygiene certificate anyway.' He hopes to add other outlets to his website and has already agreed to deliver breakfasts for Bailey's Coffee Shop in his local market. He is currently banned from KFC, but is still in talks with the chain and hopes to resolve it soon.","'Munchie Man' Paul Appleby launched a new business taking orders for McDonald's customers who don't want to pick it up for themselves .

"The only existing self-portrait by Italian master Leonardo da Vinci is to make a rare appearance in a new exhibition in Turin in northern Italy, organisers said Tuesday. The fragile and fading chalk sketch, which has only been put on show for the public three times in the last century, will be displayed for two and a half months as part of 'Leonardo and the treasures of the king', which opens on Thursday at the in the Royal Library in Turin. Italian lore has it that the gaze of Leonardo  is so intense that those who view it become stronger as a result. Intense gaze: It is said the supernatural quality of Leonardo da Vinci's self portrait was the reason it was moved to Rome in the Second World war - in an effort to stop Hitler using it to gain even greater power . There are rumours that this supernatural quality was why it was moved to Rome in the Second World war - in an effort to stop Hitler using it to gain even greater power. The library's  director, Giovanni Saccani, told the BBC: 'To prevent the Nazis from taking it, an intelligence operation saw it transported in absolute anonymity to Rome.' 'Naturally, this did not do its condition any good.' The exhibition will be made up of some 80 masterpieces conserved in the Royal Library, which was founded in 1839 by Charles Albert - then King of Piedmont and Sardinia - and is now part of a UNESCO world heritage site. 'The library contains 4,500 manuscripts, 1,500 parchments and over 3,000 drawings by the greatest artists,' Maurizio Cibrario, head of Consulta, an association which restores and promotes Turin's cultural heritage, told AFP. The exhibition will be made up of some 80 masterpieces conserved in the Royal Library, which was founded in 1839 by Charles Albert - then King of Piedmont and Sardinia . The exhibition, which runs until January 15, will include works by Renaissance artist Raphael, Baroque painter Carrache, Dutch master Rembrandt and Flemish Baroque portraitist Anthony van Dyck, as well as manuscripts and nautical manuscripts. Visitors must reserve tickets, with admission limited to 25 people every half hour. As well as an artist, Leonardo was an architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist and writer. He was born in April 1452 in Tuscany and died in May 1519 in Amboise, France. The library contains 4,500 manuscripts, 1,500 parchments and over 3,000 drawings by the greatest artists . Last month it was reported that cash-strapped France could sell the Mona Lisa to help pay off its vast national debt, the nation's media has suggested. The radical plan to put the world's best known painting on the market could 'make a dent' in the country's crippling £1,600billion deficit, state-run news channel France 24 said. The Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece hanging in the Louvre Museum in Paris is seen by up to a million visitors a year. The painting is often called 'priceless' but was valued at £60million in 1962 for insurance purposes. But with inflation and a further surge in art prices taken into account, the 2014 value of the artwork could now be around £1.5billion - or almost one per cent of national debt.","Fragile  chalk sketch has only been on show  three times in the last century .

"Barnaby Lenon, former head of Harrow School, argued at an Oxford University debate that a degree is a privilege and not a right . The former headmaster of Harrow has said that University is a privilege which is wasted on some pupils. Speaking at an Oxford University debate, Barnaby Lenon, who was headmaster of the £33,000-a-year boys school until 2011, said that 'excellence for all is nonsense.' He argued that a degree had become seen as a right because of an 'everyone must win prizes' mentality that had developed after the Second World War. Speaking alongside Tim Waterstone, who owns the book store of the same name, the pair were arguing that a University education is a privilege and not a right. According to the Oxford Student, Mr Lenon, who is chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said: 'Selection by ability has become taboo. But the idea of excellence for all is nonsense.' Questioning the merit of degrees such as communications and marketing, he added: '200,000 students getting degrees in business would be better off getting a job in a business.' Mr Waterstone said: 'No one has the right to be a scholar. You do have the right not to be discriminated against, but there is no guarantee to go to university,' according to The Telegraph. The three were debating against David Willetts, the universities minister, and Geraldine Van Bueren, professor of international human rights law at Queen Mary, University of London. Ms Van Bueren noted that 'privilege and . equal opportunity do not go hand in hand' during her argument, while Mr . Willetts argued that access to taxpayer funded Universities should not . be limited to a privileged few, but open to all. Debating against Mr Lenon was David Willetts, the universities minister, who said that access to taxpayer funded Universities should not be restricted . However he was interrupted by protesters who unfurled a banner reading 'F*** you David Willetts', before shouting abuse. After they realised that Spencer Matthews, from Made in Chelsea, was also at the debate, they added 'Made in Chelsea is s*** too' to the bottom. Mr Matthews also argued for access to higher education to be restricted, saying that . neither of his parents had been to University and had turned out fine. Stephen Dorrell, a Conservative MP, criticised Ms Van Bueren, saying that the last thing the government needed was a humans right lawyer dictating policy. Mr Lenon has spoken out about access to education before, saying that Universities were unfairly favouring state school pupils and that departments relied on private school students to stay open. The comment was made in August this year in response to UCL's decision to decrease the proportion of private school students it recruits by 10 per cent, a choice Mr Lenon described as 'so wrong'. Mr Lenon and Mr Waterstone won the debate by 24 votes. Set in 260 acres of land, with 12 boarding houses, as well as its own farm and fishing lake, Harrow is a school like no other. While the 800 all-male pupils are welcomed back each term with a meticulously folded down bed and a chocolate on their pillow, they can expect slightly harsher treatment for the rest of the year as the school operates a 'zero tolerance' policy on lax behaviour. For example it is a punishable offence to be outside without wearing a signature straw boater hat, which must also be varnished once a term. Prestigious Harrow School has 12 boarding halls set in 260 acres of land with its own fishing lake . However, for those who can stand the discipline, the rewards are immense. The institution, which costs £33,000-a-year to attend, lists eight prime ministers among its alumni, including Sir Winston Churchill, Stanley Baldwin and Sir Robert Peel. Other well-known pupils include Romantic poet Lord Byron, as well as modern-day actor Benedict Cumberbatch. Students from the school also invented the game of squash, and current pupils can take advantage of the courts on campus. Harrow has also developed its own bizarre language, and while even the school doesn't know where some of the terms come from, they remain in use to keep a sense of tradition. Some of the strangest include Beak, meaning a teacher, Ducker, meaning a swimming pool, and Eccer, which refers to any form of games. Attendees of the school could also be given a Skew, meaning a punishment, take a Tosh, meaning a bath or shower, or go to the Yarder, the outside play area.","Barnaby Lenon spoke at a debate at Oxford University .

"Warning: Property agent Trevor Abrahmsohn predicts £50,000 bills to the Treasury just to stay in your home . A powerful new lobbying group containing dozens of the country’s super-rich – and backed by a Tory MP – has been set up to thwart moves to introduce a mansion tax. The secretive outfit hopes to overturn public support for the proposed levy on multi-million-pound homes by arguing that it is ‘economically illiterate’ and would trigger a devastating crash in property prices. Chancellor George Osborne has repeatedly blocked efforts by the Lib Dems to impose the annual tax of 1 per cent on homes worth more than £2 million – but Labour leader Ed Miliband has vowed to introduce it if he comes to power in next year’s General Election. London Mayor Boris Johnson has launched an outspoken attack on the proposed tax, describing it as ‘brutally unfair’ and saying it is ‘time that people woke up to the horror of what is being planned’. In an article for today’s Mail on Sunday, Mr Johnson says: ‘Labour and the Lib Dems would have you believe that the people they want to hit are oligarchs and international bankers. ‘But the overwhelming majority of victims would be Britons who find themselves living in a house that has nudged over the threshold. ‘That includes people who currently have no idea of the risk they face. ‘It is hard to think of a tax that is more viciously unfair. It hits families who have worked hard and traded up the property ladder only to find themselves walloped for their success.’ Mr Johnson’s robust intervention is bound to lead to further speculation about his political ambitions at Westminster. The new lobbying group, organised by a property mogul who operates in some of the capital’s most exclusive areas, was discreetly launched last November at a meeting in a West End restaurant attended by 65 of the richest people in the UK – including Russian oligarchs and multi-millionaires from the Middle East. They were addressed by Tory MP Richard Harrington, who urged them to ‘donate to the Conservatives’ if they wanted to stop the levy. Chancellor George Osborne has made repeated blocks to the Lib Dem motion but now Ed Miliband has pledged to carry it through . Despite Tory opposition, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has warned that the tax, which would affect about 60,000 homes, would be a ‘die-in-the-trench policy’ in any future coalition negotiations. It would mean that the owner of a £2.5 million house having to pay £25,000 a year to the Treasury just to stay in their home. Mr Miliband’s support means that only a Conservative majority at the Election is now likely to prevent it being introduced. Last night, Mr Harrington, the Tory MP for Watford and a shareholder in a property development company, said: ‘I am all for everyone paying their fair share to help the economy, but this is not the right way to go about it.’ Mr Harrington’s £3.5 million house in Hampstead, North London, would result in him having to pay £35,000 annually. Trevor Abrahmsohn, the luxury property agent who has set up the group, predicted that the tax would cause owners to sell their homes en masse. Nick Clegg has told Cameron the tax will be his 'die-in-the-trench policy' in any future negotiations . ‘Three out of four enquiries we get about homes above a certain value now concern the tax,’ he told The Mail on Sunday. He claimed a typical salary for someone in a £5 million house is about £150,000 a year, leaving them less than £100,000 in take-home income – around half of which would have to be paid to the Treasury in tax. ‘There would be no alternative but for them to sell, which would cause a crash in property prices all the way down the scale. And not just in the capital, the ripple effects would be felt far and wide.’ He declined to identify the guests at the meeting or even the restaurant where they met. Mr Abrahmsohn has sold more than £3 billion of property for clients including Britain’s richest man, Lakshmi Mittal. He added: ‘We need to get the message across – this is not about rich people furthering their own interests. 'It will raise a tiny amount of money in the scheme of things, perhaps £1 billion, but cause mayhem in the process. It is economically illiterate and class warfare. The politics of envy are back.’ Opponents of the tax also say the tax would require a new bureaucracy to value every home, and an expensive appeals procedure. The construction trade would be hard hit, and foreign investors deterred from settling in the country. Mr Abrahmsohn, 60, added: ‘The Lib Dems and Labour feel this primitive tax has been very well received amongst their core voters. As might be the erection of 20 crucifixes along the Mall with bankers firmly pinned to them, but that does not make it good policy’.","New lobby group launched by multi-millionaires in West End restaurant .

"Extravagant ideas: Gwyneth Paltrow's festive stocking filler list includes a £3,100 juicer . She has already told us how to splash out £300,000 on a new summer wardrobe. Now Gwyneth Paltrow is urging us to line up a few pricey stocking fillers – and top of her picks is a gold-plated juicer costing £3,100. The item is on a £69,000 list of festive gifts recommended on her lifestyle website Goop – which has been operating at a loss and is much derided for its extravagant gift ideas that seem only within reach of the super-rich. Actress Paltrow, 42, who reportedly earns around £12million a year from her movies, urged fans to treat a loved one to the Easy Health Angel Juicer Gold – the world’s first gold-plated juicer – because it is ‘absurd, but awesome’. She also recommends a £9,000 diamond-shaped vase from luxury brand Esque and ‘bargains’ including a £4,800 Cartier bracelet and baggage by Valentino for £2,900. Although she admits the bag is costly, the Hollywood star writes: ‘Yeah right, but how cool is this?’ Her Christmas guide was already attracting derisive comments on social media last night. Lynda Swaney wrote on Twitter: ‘Do we need this?...Truly the most ridiculous items!’ Paltrow, who also suggests a £900 Hermes blanket and a £367 pair of Golden Goose sneakers for older children, says she has tried to include items for the budget-conscious. ‘We tried to keep as much as possible at the $100 (£62) mark, though there are some splurges for your nearest and dearest,’ she wrote. ‘Plus, a girl can always dream.’ Despite her upbeat tone, Paltrow is losing money three years after she founded Goop, which she says shares ‘all of life’s positives’ and features recipes, fashion advice and travel tips. Worth it? While juicing is all the rage nowadays, shelling out on a £3,100 Super Angel juicer in gold may not be everyone's idea of money well spent . Stocking filler?

"Shy Dahan has been cleared of pretending to  be a millionaire to gamble huge sums of cash in a casino . A businessman walked free today after being cleared of pretending to be a millionaire in order to gamble thousands of pounds on credit in a London casino. Shy Dahan was accused of using bogus Credit Suisse paperwork to mislead staff at the Playboy Club in Mayfair about his wealth in a bid to gain credit. Mr Dahan, 33, produced documents from the Gibraltar arm of the Swiss bank showing he had £1million in his current account, jurors at Southwark Crown Court were told. Today a jury cleared Mr Dahan of a single count of fraud by false representation after deliberating for four hours and 22 minutes. On November 27, 2012, Mr Dahan visited the  casino on Park Lane and applied for credit to gamble. He ended up owing the club £230,000 which he has now repaid. Defence counsel Philip Hackett QC said the single charge regarded the letter from the defendant's bank to the Playboy Casino bank. Regarding the letter Mr Hackett said: 'It was indeed signed from Credit Suisse, signed by an individual at Credit Suisse although he originally denied it. 'However, it was clear on the evidence that he did not have the authority to sign it and that a co-signatory had not signed it so he acted in excess of his authority to do it and the prosecution's case is that the defendant procured him to do that.' He added the letter 'was not required and not relied on' by Mr Dahan. Mr Dahan was previously cleared of similar charges relating to the Clermont Club in Berkeley Square in. He was acquitted of three counts of fraud by false representation on 22 August this year during his first trial. Shy Dahan had been accused of using bogus Credit Suisse paperwork to mislead casino staff about his wealth in a bid to gain credit . It was found he had no case to answer and the jury were discharged from considering the count relating to the Playboy Club. Mr Dahan paid his debt to the Playboy Club following a hearing at Southwark Crown Court earlier this month when Mr Hackett successfully applied to the court to unfreeze his assets. Mr Dahan, of Mayfair, and formerly of Tel-Aviv in Israel, denied the single count of fraud by false representation.","Shy Dahan had been accused of pretending to be a millionaire so he could gamble huge sums of cash .

"An architect is hoping to make almost £3 million by selling his 300-year-old home and its entire contents of antiques. Giles Newby Vincent, an interior designer who has worked for Lord Heseltine and Elton John, has spent the past 15 years collecting antique furniture. The outstanding private collection is made up of carefully selected pieces ranging from fine early 18th century furniture, painting, silver, Delftware and antique textiles. On the market: An architect is hoping to make almost £3 million by selling this 300-year-old home and its antique contents .

Giles used the antiques to kit out The Old Rectory, a stunning Grade II Listed home in Wickhambreaux, Kent. But he has now decided it time to sell everything and plough the earnings into his next project - refurbishing a dilapidated villa overlooking the sea near St Tropez, France. The antiques and classic furniture are expected to net the architect, 53, in excess of £600,000 when they are auctioned off by Bonhams in March.

An early 20th century tin plated clockwork toy is one of the unusual pieces up for grabs to bidders . Born into a family of antique collectors and architects, Giles inherited a love of old buildings and beautiful objects and was drawing house plans from the age of five. Giles' grandfather was a gentleman architect while his mother's family were responsible for a number of country homes in Herefordshire. His aunt was Elizabeth Newby Vincent, an eccentric antique dealer from Devizes, Wilts. He said: 'My aunt had rather trenchant views. She insisted that 'antiques should look inherited rather than bought' and that good proportions, patina and a romantic sense of atmosphere are paramount.' Her advice rubbed off and, as a result, the contents of The Old Rectory fit perfectly with the home. Giles inherited a love of old buildings and beautiful objects and was drawing house plans from the age of five. The antiques and classic furniture are expected to net the architect, 53, in excess of £600,000 when they are auctioned off by Bonhams . A Queen Anne walnut double domed bureau is among the star lots and should sell for around £40,000. Another important piece is a Queen Anne walnut feather-banded bachelor chest, which should fetch around the same figures. There are also dozens of antique plates, cutlery sets, paintings and ornaments. The items are being sold as part of the Fine English Furniture sale in Bond Street on March 12. The Old Rectory was built in 1713 and is considered one Kent's finest small Queen Anne country houses. Spread across 9,000sq/ft, the home has eight-bedrooms and five reception rooms.

Giles said: 'I am selling pretty much all of the contents, but keeping a few which have a sentimental value. 'I have spent the past 15 years collecting it and it has been a real labour of love assembling them. It will be sad to see it go, as I love many of these pieces. 'But they wouldn't work with the property in France. I hope they will now find new owners who will appreciate them as much as I have. 'The furniture fits The Old Rectory perfectly. It is a Grade II listed home and is exactly as it was when it was built. 'It is a beautiful home and must have really had the wow factor in its day. The front door is about eight-foot high which must have been to show off.' The sale of the antiques takes place at Bonhams' New Bond Street saleroom on March 12, starting at 10am.

"A woman has told how terrorists used her as a human shield and fired through her legs during a kidnapping in Yemen that was allegedly aided by Abu Hamza. Margaret Thompson said that she was told: ‘It’s goodbye to you’ as she and 15 others mostly from the UK were forced to stand on 3ft high sand banks during a gun battle with government forces. She saw British hostage Ruth Williamson pushed in front by a terrorist with a rifle in her back - and fall to the floor as she was shot dead. Islamist cleric Abu Hamza pictured in a court sketch at the Federal Court in Lower Manhattan, New York, where he is on trial for allegedly aiding a kidnapping which turned into a bloodbath . By the time the Yemeni army overwhelmed the kidnappers, three Britons and an Australian had been killed in the bloodbath, which took place in 1998. Mrs Thompson, an American, spoke of her ordeal publicly for the first time last night during the New York trial of Hamza, who is accused of providing the kidnappers with a satellite phone, topping it up with £500 of credit and offering to be their go-between. He is also alleged to have helped set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, and facilitated jihad in Afghanistan. Hamza, 56, has denied all the allegations. Mrs Thompson at times appeared emotional as she gave evidence and told how the trip to Yemen was supposed to be a two-week adventure of a lifetime. She was living in London at the time due to her her job with a multinational IT company and booked it through British company Explore, which is popular with holidaymakers in the UK. Hamza is said to have offered to be the kidnappers' go-between as well as helping them with a satellite phone . Hamza is also accused of helping set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon. He has denied the charges . But as the . group travelled in a convoy of five SUVs between the cities of Habban . and Aden they were stopped by armed Islamists in trucks before 20 other . terrorists jumped out from the side of the road. Mrs . Thompson, in her 50s, said the kidnappers had rifles, grenades, machine . guns mounted to their vehicles and rocket propelled grenade launchers. Mrs . Thompson’s vehicle was at the back of the group but as they tried to . drive off the terrorists, who belonged to the extremist Aden-Abyan . Islamic Army, started screaming at them. She . said: ‘I thought they were firing them into the air but it sounded like . the bullets were hitting metal so we thought they were hitting the car. We fell towards the floor as low as we could get’. Ruth Williamson, from Edinburgh, and Durham university lecturer Peter Rowe were among the four hostages killed as Yemeni security services tried to end the kidnapping in 1998 . As the kidnappers drove all 16 tourists away Mrs Thompson said that ‘we were very quiet, we were very scared. We were looking at each other out of the corners of our eyes but there was no conversation’. The . group were taken to a remote area of the desert where the leader of . their captors asked them why they thought they were there as one of his . soldiers played with a grenade to intimidate them. Mrs Thompson said: ‘He said: ""It’s not your fault that your countries bombed Iraq. You are going to be safe, everything is going to be OK. We have friends in prison and we are going to keep you until they are released"".' The hostages slept in their sleeping bags out in the open overnight and by the next morning they could hear distant gunfire as the Yemeni forces got closer. A Yemeni militiaman pieces through the debris after the desert shoot out in 1998 . Mrs . Thompson said that they were led out to the sand dunes and made to stand . ‘with our arms up’ as one of the kidnappers addressed them. She said: ‘He said: ""It’s goodbye to you."" I hoped it meant that they were getting ready to release us but I feared it meant we were going to die’. By now the gunfire was much closer and the hostages were led to a nearby ravine before being brought back to stand on the dunes. Mrs Thompson said: ‘The gunfire was more constant than it might have been earlier. It was coming both from towards and behind. ‘From behind a number of the kidnappers were lying on their stomachs against the (dune) shooting their guns between our legs. The gunfire sounded very close. I heard the whizz of the bullets in the air as it passed us’. The group were on their way to the coastal city of Aden when they were taken hostage . The confrontation then reached its horrific conclusion. Mrs Thompson said: ‘At that point another kidnapper grabbed (hostage) Mary Quin by the back and had a gun in her back and at that point he began pushing her forward, running across the open area between the first and second (dune)’ Two other terrorists did the same with Miss Williamson, 34, an NHS employee from Edinburgh, and Catherine Spence, an Australian. Radical Islamic preacher Hamza was running Finsbury Park mosque in north London at the time . Mrs Thompson said: ‘For the three that were being pushed forward each of them had a kidnapper behind her with a rifle in their back. The one that had Mary Quin was in front and the other two were further back, in a triangle formation’. Mrs Thompson watched as all three went over another dune - but only Mrs Quin came up immediately. At that point Mrs Thompson was shot in the left leg and fell to the floor with an injury which would leave her with a shattered pelvis. But then the Yemeni forces arrived and bundled everyone into helicopters and flew them to hospital. As she lay on a stretcher on the aircraft Mrs Thompson could see at her feet the dead bodies of teacher Margaret Whitehouse, 52, from Hook in Hampshire, and Peter Rowe, 60, a university lecturer from Durham. The Australian who died was Andrew Thirsk, 35 - Miss Spence was his wife and she survived. Hamza is said to have offered to be the kidnappers’ go-between as well as helping them with the satellite phone. Prosecutors say that among the ‘friends’ they all wanted freed was Hamza’s son-in-law Mohammad. Today the court is due to hear from Mrs Quin, who flew to London in 2005 to confront Hamza at the Finsbury Park Mosque in London where he used to be the imam. Hamza, who has stumps for arms after losing them fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, is also due to give evidence if the prosecution concludes its case. The trial continues.

"He has been moving from city to city in South East Asia keeping his eyes and ears open for any attempt by North Korean agents to assassinate him. But Kim Jong-nam, the elder half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, has daringly stepped out into the public gaze in Indonesia - and tucked into a dish of 'spag-bol' in an Italian restaurant in Jakarta. He even wrapped a burly arm around the chef's shoulders as they posed for a photo, but the chef was so concerned about his own safety that he asked for his face to be obscured. Kim Jong-nam, the elder half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, poses for a photo with the chef of an Italian restaurant in Jakarta earlier this month . Kim looked every part the aging playboy he is reputed to be as he brazenly grinned into the camera with his dangling sunglasses and straw hat. Happy to shake off memories of bibimbap - a common North Korean dish of rice, vegetables and occasionally eggs and meat - Kim is said to have consumed his Italian meal with great relish in the upmarket restaurant. The photo was acquired by South Korea's YTN television network from a friend of Kim's. ‘Despite reports that Kim Jong-nam's safety was in question following the execution of his uncle, Jang Song-taek, he is still alive and well,' said a source close to the family. 'He's living the same lavish lifestyle, moving around between Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and France.' He has been seen in the casinos of Macau and slipping into fine-dining restaurants throughout South East Asia. But he is said to be aware that his life remains in constant danger because he criticised the King Jong-un regime and he made sure he 'disappeared' following the execution of Jang last December. Another source claims that a North Korean agent had tried to assassinate Kim Jong-nam in Macau in 2011, but failed after a bloody shootout with his bodyguards. He fled to another city. Since then, he has lived the life of a wandering playboy and when he visited the Italian restaurant - which is owned by a Japanese businessman - he was accompanied by an attractive woman aged in her early 30s. Kim Jong-Nam has been moving from city to city in South East Asia amid concerns of an assassination attempt by North Korean agents . Until late 2011, when his father - former leader Kim Jong-il, who is also Kim Jong-un's father by a different mother - was still alive, Jong-nam shuffled back and forth between Beijing and Macau, where his first and second wives lived. He is also known to have travelled to Thailand, Austria and Russia, stopping in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, from time to time. But following the death of his father he disappeared from view, fearing the purges being carried out by his younger half-brother. He has been able to live well, say North Korea watchers, thanks to benefits from building projects and trading companies set up by his executed uncle Jang Song-taek. 'It is possible that he believes he is not on the list of those to be purged by the current North Korean regime,' a source said. 'This is why he has happily posed for a photo in an Indonesian restaurant. But he would not have gone back there a second time - just in case.' In fact, it is believed he has moved on from Jakarta since the picture was taken earlier this month. He is said to be still on his guard, worried that his playboy lifestyle might have infuriated his younger half-brother, who had been angered by the 'worldliness and womanising' of Kim Jang-taek. There is speculation that Beijing is watching Kim Jong-nam's back for him, with a pencilled-in plan to install him as leader of North Korea should the regime of Kim Jong-un collapse.","Kim Jong-nam posed for photos with chef at Italian restaurant in Jakarta .

"A bride-to be hanged herself just weeks before her wedding because she was so worried about becoming the centre of attention, an inquest heard. Leanne Baker, 35, was discovered by her fiancé after hanging herself at their home in Huddersfield, West Yorks on June 2, last year. Miss Baker, who worked as a retail manager, had suffered from depression five years earlier but had recovered with treatment and medication. Leanne Baker, 35, was discovered by her fiancé after hanging herself at their home in Huddersfield on June 2, last year . The inquest heard that Miss Baker had no doubt about spending her life with her partner, David Jackson (right) However her anxiety and stress had returned in April 2013 which culminated in her taking an overdose the following month. The inquest heard she was anxious about her imminent marriage ceremony abroad as she did not like being the centre of attention in Lindos, Greece, which was due to take place on June 10 last year. Speaking today, Miss Baker's parents John and Carol Baker have spoken about the 'cruel illness' which took their daughter before her wedding. Carol, 67, a textile worker, married to 67-year-old retired carer John, said: 'She was very nervous. She just couldn't cope. 'She came out of work one day and said: ""Mum, that illness has come back"". 'She tried everything, but she was in a panic because she wanted to be herself for the wedding. 'The wedding had all been paid for but she couldn't cope. She said to me: ""I have everything I want but I've got nothing, it's just black'. 'It was the illness that took her, it wasn't my daughter. We were so so close  and it's such a cruel illness. 'She was really ill. She said to me: ""If I were a dog mum they'd shoot me"". Leanne had everything planned for her wedding day - including the cake and dress - but suffered from depression . The inquest heard that Leanne had told her parents and fiance about her fears that her depression had returned and she worried she wouldn’t be well enough to go ahead with her wedding abroad. She told the mental health team that she had no doubt about spending her life with her partner David Jackson, the Coroner's Court heard. The court heard on May 4, 2013, Leanne took an overdose and attempted to take her own life and was admitted to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary for two weeks. She was seen by mental health services as an outpatient at Folly Hall on May 16. Leanne told practitioner Victoria Wilford at that appointment she did not regret her overdose actions and had ‘thoughts of not wanting to be here’. After the appointment her parents agreed to be with her when her fiance was at work so she was rarely alone. She was referred for home-based intensive treatment by a Community Psychiatric team as an alternative to hospital. She was in contact with the team daily and was said to be showing signs of getting better. Her . anxiety over her wedding was affecting her mood and she had suicidal . thoughts but repeatedly said she was not going to act on it. But the court heard on June 2 her fiance left her at home to visit his mother and found her hanged when he returned. West Yorkshire Coroner Mary Burke said that she was satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that Leanne was fully aware of the consequences of her actions. Ms Burke, who expressed her sympathy to the family, concluded: 'I am also satisfied she intended the consequences would be to end her own life. 'In conclusion Leanne Baker has killed herself'. Afterwards her mother, who described herself and Leanne as 'best friends', explained that her daughter had everything planned . for her wedding day - including the cake and dress. She said: 'It was an expensive dress that would have been £1,500 but my friend owns a bridal shop and gave it for sale price. 'About 30 guests were going - all our friends and family.  Leanne had always wanted to get married abroad, she used to say it when she was a little girl.' The court heard on June 2 her fiance left her at home to visit his mother and found her hanged when he returned . Leanne had always wanted to get married abroad, and had chosen Lindos in Greece for her big day . She added: 'It's just devastating. The whole family are devastated. It wasn't my daughter that did it, it was the illness. 'She was the most wonderful daughter a mother could have. I want people to know how lovely and precious she was to us. 'We . were with her every day for a month. Dave is still living with us. He's . had cancer twice and then this, I just think what a lonely place to . be.' The family have set up the Leanne Baker Trust Fund to raise money for charity. They will be holding a curry night and . auction at the Pink Elephant in Meltham, West Yorkshire, in March, and . Leanne's brother Darren will also auction some of his artwork. Carol added: 'People have been really supportive and I want to thank them for that.' In the .

"A Neo-Nazi group created a perverted board game based on Monopoly where Jewish people get sent to death camps so they could pass the time between murders. The game, where the winner is the person who deports the most to the gas chambers, has featured at the trial of 'Nazi bride' Beate Zschape in Munich. Zschape, 39, is allegedly the sole-surviving member of the National Socialist Underground neo-Nazi death squad which allegedly murdered nine immigrant businessmen and a female police officer in Germany in a 13-year reign of terror which also included bank robberies, bombings and weapons seizures. The gang called the game 'Pogromly' - from the word pogrom meaning a violent riot that were often organised against Jews in Russian and eastern Europe over several centuries . The NSU is a far-right German terrorist group which was uncovered in November 2011. They have been accused of a series of murders of nine immigrants in 2006, murdering a policewoman and attempted murder of her colleague, the Cologne bombings in 2001 and 2004 and 14 bank robberies. In January last year, Beate Zschape was committed to trial accused of ten counts of murder.Miss Zschäpe, who denies the charges against her, has refused to give evidence. She has been described as a quiet woman who kept her political views to herself. The gang called the game 'Pogromly' - from the word pogrom meaning a violent riot that were often organised against Jews in Russian and eastern Europe over several centuries - and features a skull wearing a German helmet in the centre of the board, S.S. runic flashes and plenty of swastikas. Zschaepe, 39, is allegedly the sole-surviving member of the National Socialist Underground neo-Nazi death squad . Prosecutors at the Munich trial of Zschape and several accomplices say she and her now-dead NSU sidekicks invented the game to pass away the time between assassinations and robberies. The aim of the game was to annihilate Jewish life in German cities and send Jews to death camps. It became a major exhibit on day 85 of the trial which is the biggest neo-Nazi process ever heard in postwar Germany. Prosecutors said Zschape invented it with gang members - and her lovers - Uwe Boehnhardt, 34, and Uwe Mundlos, 38. Both of them committed suicide two years ago after a botched bank raid, leaving Zschape to torch their hideout. The gang allegedly hoped that by randomly murdering immigrants they would force hundreds of thousands of people to leave Germany for their homelands. A police officer who investigated the game told the court: 'The idea was to get Jew-free towns.' It features a skull wearing a German helmet in the centre of the board, S.S. runic flashes and plenty of swastikas . Instead of the four railway stations that feature on every Monopoly board the gang had the name of four notorious concentration and death camps: Auschwitz, Dachau, Ravensbrueck and Buchenwald. Chance and Community Chest cards had instructions like: 'Go to the next concentration camp and hand in the captured Jews and make the owner pay twice the normal rent.' On another: 'You fought off a horde of red lice using a machine gun.  Reward; 2,000 Reichsmark.' The gang made several copies of the game which they sold to far-right fanatics themselves across Germany for around £80 a game. The proceeds went towards financing their life underground as they carried out their murder missions. The indictment against Zschape states that the helped devise the game 'in an insidious way and identifying completely with the genocide of the Jews in the Third Reich.' The trial continues.","Details of game revealed during trial of alleged member of neo-Nazi group National Socialist Undergound .

"Jesean Morris, 20, was wanted for violating his parole in Omaha, Nebraska . A young man trying to give back by taking part in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge last week ended up getting hosed when authorities recognized him as a fugitive wanted for violating his parole. Jesean Morris, 20, found himself heading back to prison  when police were tipped of about the video posted on his Facebook page. Someone who knew Morris alerted authorities in Omaha, Nebraska, after watching the video and recognizing Morris, and also identified the house where it was shot. 'They were given a specific house' by one tipster, Officer Kevin Wiese, a police spokesman told Omaha.com. On Friday afternoon, officers Nick Sidzyik and Dan Martin set out to the house to see if they could possibly find and capture the foolish fugitive. Their hard work paid off when they saw him getting in the backseat of a friend's car that afternoon. The officers then followed Morris, and, once they stopped the vehicle, the wanted man was anything but charitable, giving the men a false name and birth date and spitting in the face of Martin, this after kicking out a safety partition in the cruiser. He was booked later that day on the outstanding warrant and on suspicion of criminal impersonation, resisting arrest and assaulting an officer. A judge set Morris' bail at $40,000. Morris was on parole following his release from the Omaha Correctional Center, where he served a sentence as the result of a 2010 conviction for assault and use of a firearm during a crime. He was 16 at the time, but charged as an adult, as the shootout he was involved in left two men wounded. Even worse, Morris' Ice Bucket Challenge seems to have been removed from his Facebook page. The ALS Association has raised $79.7 million to combat Lou Gehrig's Disease since July 29, almost entirely as a result of the Challenge.

"Two suicide bombers who blew up their cars outside an orphanage as they tried to hit an Iranian cultural center killed at least four people and wounded more than a hundred. The pair attacked a Shiite district in southern Beirut, according to Lebanese officials and an al-Qaida linked group that claimed responsibility for the devastating attack. The Abdullah Azzam Brigades said it had carried out the simultaneous bombings as retaliation for the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian war alongside President Bashar Assad's forces.

The radical Lebanese group Abdullah Azzam Brigades, which claimed the attack on its Twitter account, also said it was responsible for a November 19 attack on the Iranian embassy that killed 23 people, using the same tactic of twin suicide bombs. In both cases, most of the victims were civilians. Hezbollah is a powerful Shi'ite Muslim political and militant group in Lebanon that is funded by Iran. The group has sent hundreds of fighters to neighbouring Syria, giving a boost to its ally President Bashar al-Assad against mainly Sunni rebels seeking to topple him. 'We will continue - through the grace of . God and his strength - to target Iran and its party in Lebanon . (Hezbollah) in all of their security, political and military centres to . achieve our two demands: One, the exit of all fighters from the Party of . Iran in Syria.

The morning blasts in the Bir Hassan district set cars and trees ablaze and shattered the windows of nearby buildings.

The Abdullah Azzam Brigades said on its Twitter account that the 'invasion of the Iranian cultural center' was in 'retaliation for Iran's party fighting along the criminal regime in Syria.' It was referring to Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group. 'We will continue to target Iran and its party in Lebanon through their security, political and military offices until Hezbollah fighters withdraw from Syria and scores of Islamic detainees are released from Lebanese jails'.

The radical Lebanese group Abdullah Azzam Brigades claimed the attack on its Twitter account . The Abdullah Azzam Brigades said it had carried out the simultaneous bombings as retaliation for the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian war . It said Hezbollah will not 'enjoy security in Lebanon until the people of Syria feel secure.' Hezbollah legislator Ali Ammar, speaking from the site of the blasts, said the group 'will not withdraw from a strategic battle that aims to foil plans to divide the region.' Iran is a major backer of Hezbollah and both are allies of Assad. The explosions came few days after Prime Minister Tammam Salam formed a new cabinet after almost 11 months of paralysis. He said today that the attack is 'a message by forces of terrorism to continue in their plan to spread death in Lebanon.' 'We got the message and we will respond to it with solidarity and our commitment to peace,' he said. The three-year uprising in Syria, which began as popular protests but descended into civil war, has increasingly been taken over by Sunni Islamist groups. Some rebel groups have affinities or direct links to al Qaeda or militant groups in neighbouring countries such as Lebanon and Iraq. The Abdullah Azzam Brigades have strong links to Lebanon's Palestinian refugee camps as well as connections with the Gulf. One of its senior military leaders, Majid bin Muhammad al-Majid, was a Saudi national. He was arrested by Lebanese authorities last December, who said he died from kidney failure while in their custody.","Suicide bombers blew up their cars trying to hit an Iranian cultural center .

"A couple whose car was damaged by a pothole have won a victory over the local council – who lied to avoid paying compensation. Jane Tramontana, 59, drove over the 3ft-wide hole and the collision blew out the tyres on her Nissan Micra. When her husband Phillip Charles, 49, arrived at the scene, the road was ‘littered’ with cars that had hit the hole. Jane Tramontana and Phil Charles beside the repaired pot hole in Sutton Bassett, after it damaged their car . But when they reported the incident to Northamptonshire County . Council in January last year, the authority claimed to have no knowledge . of the road defect and refused to pay compensation for the damaged . vehicle. The couple decided to fight the ruling and are now celebrating . victory after a court ordered the council to pay them £311. Northampton . County Court heard the authority had already been informed of the . dangerous pothole, in Sutton Bassett, and had recorded it as a priority . case to be fixed within five days. The authority had actually been informed of the dangerous pothole but claimed to have no knowledge of it . But the repairs were not carried out and council chiefs claimed to have no knowledge of the problem. District Judge Sarah Watson told the court: ‘There are clear problems with the way the council deals with dangerous potholes.’ Following . the year-long legal battle grandfather-of-two Mr Charles urged other . road users to fight councils for compensation. The electronics engineer . yesterday described the case as ‘a nightmare’. He said: ‘When I got to . Sutton Bassett I found the road just littered with cars that had hit . this hole – you couldn’t avoid it. 'Every one had damaged their tyres. I . called the police in the end because it was obviously dangerous.’ The council denied being told of the pothole, but ‘they clearly had’, Mr Charles said. ‘We . were told that people had reported it and since it is dangerous they . should have fixed it straightaway. But they still tried to claim it . wasn’t a problem. They even sent us a group of reports that were . obviously for a different hole.’ Bureaucrats at the council headquarters (above) said they had no knowledge of the pothole so could not pay out any compensation . The collision blew out both the front and rear tyres on her Nissan Micra (stock image) This is not the first time a council has tried to wriggle out of paying compensation. Frank Cattrall damaged his car driving over a pothole, he decided that Essex County Council council should foot the repair bill. But rather than admit fault, officials said they knew nothing of the hole and said his poor driving must have been to blame. They dismissed the 62-year-old grandfather’s claim that they should pay the £500 bill to fix the wrecked suspension on his Renault Espace. But Mr Cattrall used a Freedom of Information request, he found out that a council worker had reported the 18in by 6in hole during an inspection three months earlier – but the council had ignored it. The hole was even recorded as a priority case that should be repaired within 28 days, but it was never fixed. But even after Mr Cattrall, a retired BT project manager, told Essex County Council of his findings, it still refused to pay up – and the disagreement went to the small claims court. At a hearing at Colchester County Court, a judge ruled in favour of Mr Cattrall and ordered the council to refund him £500, plus costs of £115. He added: ‘They then bombard you with all sorts of documents and hope they will confuse you into just going away. ‘It’s . just not acceptable … These potholes are dangerous for any road users. A . cyclist could be sent flying off their bike and die.’ The couple from Market Harborough, Leicestershire, are calling on councils to change their policies on fixing road defects. Most . authorities promise to repair dangerous potholes within five days of . inspection, but before 2010 there was a policy of two-hour or 24-hour . repairs for ‘critical’ problems. The pair said the pothole in Sutton . Bassett was so dangerous it should have been fixed on the same day. Miss . Tramontana, a medical receptionist, told the court: ‘This defect was, . without any doubt, a serious road hazard and should have been repaired . immediately following inspection given its size and location.’ Northamptonshire County Council refused to comment. The . legal victory comes just one month after the Mail reported that . 62-year-old Frank Cattrall forced Essex County Council to pay £615 for . his car repairs after he proved they had ignored potholes. A council worker had reported the 18in-by-6in hole that damaged his car three months before the incident but it was not fixed.","Jane Tramontana drove over the 3ft-wide hole while driving through Sutton Basset and the collision blew out both the tyres on her Nissan Micra .

"Suspected explosive devices sent to Army recruitment offices in southern England bear 'hallmarks of Northern Ireland-related terrorism', Number 10 has said. And one of the packages has been discovered to have had a Republic of Ireland postmark on it, it has been claimed. Four suspicious packages were discovered in offices in Oxford, Brighton, Canterbury and the Queensmere shopping centre in Slough today, counter-terrorism police officers said. Bomb disposal units at the scene in Brighton after a suspect package was delivered to the Army careers office . Four suspect packages have been delivered to Army careers offices in the south-east of England, including one in Brighton . Specialist officers and equipment were called in to the scene after the 'crude' threat was sent . One package was found in Aldershot, Hampshire, yesterday, while two packets were found on Tuesday at the armed forces careers office in Reading, Berkshire, and the Army and RAF careers office in Chatham, Kent, the South East Counter Terrorism Unit (Sectu) said. Police officers found 'basic but viable' devices, but consider them a 'low-level threat', sources said. Prime Minister David Cameron chaired a meeting of the Government’s Cobra emergencies committee to discuss the suspicious parcels, which sources said were 'crude' in design but 'could have caused injury to others'. A Number 10 spokeswoman said: 'Seven suspect packages have been identified as containing small, crude, but potentially viable devices bearing the hallmarks of Northern Ireland-related terrorism. 'These have now been safely dealt with by the police and bomb disposal units. 'Guidance has been issued to staff at all military establishments and Royal Mail asking them to be extra vigilant and to look out for any suspect packages and the screening procedures for mail to armed forces careers offices is being reviewed. 'The national threat level remains under constant review.' Police and bomb disposal teams in St Peter's Street, Canterbury, patrol the area following the bomb scare today . Shoppers have been evacuated from surrounding streets after 'explosive devices' were found at an army recruitment centre in Canterbury, Kent . These are the locations in southern England where the packages have been found in Army recruitment offices . Ministry of Defence bomb disposal units were called, although this is routine with any suspect package. Detective Superintendent Stan Gilmour, of Sectu, said: 'The contents of the packages are suspicious in nature and will now be sent off for forensic examination. 'Even if the contents are determined to be a viable device, they pose a very low-level threat and are unlikely to cause significant harm or damage. 'When a suspect package is reported we have a routine response which means we may need to evacuate the area if necessary until we can be sure it poses no threat to the public. 'While this can cause concern and disruption for local communities, it is a necessary precaution until we know what we are dealing with.' Police officers found 'basic but viable' devices that were delivered to the careers' centre in Oxford . The packages, one which was sent to an office Chatham, Kent, were 'crude' in design but 'could have caused injury to others' Advice has been sent to the Royal Mail and to the Ministry of Defence to ensure that staff 'remain vigilant', Sectu added. The Queensmere shopping centre in Slough was evacuated, while cordons were placed close to all offices where packages have been found. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said security advice has been reiterated to its personnel, while the Royal Mail said it was co-operating with the police investigation. It is understood that a suspected package found at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk was a false alarm and is not related to the investigation at the armed forces recruitment offices. Dissident Irish republicans have targeted England on several occasions since the 1970s. In the aftermath of Bloody Sunday, in 1972, a bomb was detonated in Aldershot, at the headquarters of the Parachute Regiment, killing seven people. A year later two bombs were set off by IRA members in London, including one outside the Old Bailey, which killed one man and injured 180 others. In 1972, a bomb was detonated in Aldershot, at the headquarters of the Parachute Regiment, killing seven . In 1973, two bombs were set off by IRA members in London, including one outside the Old Bailey (pictured) In 1974, 21 people were killed in a Birmingham pub bombing, while another 11 died after an IRA bomb was planted on a coach carrying servicemen and their families along the M62. Ten years later, the Conservative Party conference in Brighton was targeted, killing five people. In the 1990s, the IRA set off a large bomb at London’s Canary Wharf offices, killing two people and causing millions of pounds of damage.

"When Kate Moss was unveiled as the face and incredibly toned body of St Tropez earlier this week, the world was reminded of exactly why she has earned the title as the world's most famous supermodel. The famed party girl may be 39, but in the tan campaign she displays the flawless skin of someone half her age. But as someone who likes the odd cigarette and night out on the town, many are left wondering how does she maintain such a glowing visage? So THAT'S her secret! Kate Moss submerges her face in ice and cucumber water every day to keep her skin looking supple and awake . But now her intriguing beauty secret has been revealed: the supermodel submerges her face into a sinkful of iced cucumber water in the morning to perk up her skin. 'If I wake up looking tired and puffy, I fill a sink with ice and cucumber and submerge my face. 'It tightens everything making you look and feel instantly awake. It is a bit Joan Crawford - but it works!,' she told Stylist magazine. Cucumber and the skin share the same level of hydrogen, so the fruit can easily help to cure problem areas. She's still got it: Posing in her latest campaign for St. Tropez, the 39-year-old proves she's still got what it takes, is it all thanks to her beauty trick? It has a cooling effect and helps in soothing and softening the skin. And, even better, it costs no more than a pound. Speaking about how she keeps her beach body in tip-top condition, Moss also explained that she thoroughly exfoliates her skin before she jets off on holiday and practices plenty of Pilates to ensure her body is toned to perfection.

"Budding scientists and mathematicians may be better off heading to the United States or Asia to study for a degree as the UK lags behind in these subjects, new rankings reveal. UK universities are facing increasingly stiff competition from other nations in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) disciplines. The 10 subjects with the fewest UK universities in the top 200 - those 200 institutions that are considered the best places to study the discipline - were all science and maths based subjects. But those students planning on careers in areas such as geography, history, English and modern languages should look at studying at Oxford or Cambridge, which are considered the best in the world for these disciplines. America leads the boards: Harvard was ranked number one in 11 subjects and MIT in nine . The latest annual QS World University Rankings by Subject shows that globally, Oxford is the UK's best performing institution. It took first place in three subjects - English language and literature, modern languages and geography. This means it was rated number one more than any other university in the world except Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both in the US. Harvard was ranked number one in 11 subjects and MIT in nine. Cambridge was ranked first globally in one subject - history. 1 - Harvard University, US . 2 - Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US . 3 - Oxford University, UK . 4= - University of California, Berkeley, US . 4= - Cambridge University, UK . While the UK is still performing strongly in the arts and humanities, the findings suggest, it is falling behind in maths and science. Of the 10 subjects with the most UK universities in the top 200 - those 200 institutions that are considered the best places to study the discipline - just two were STEM-related. These were psychology and environmental science. And the 10 disciplines that had the fewest UK institutions in the top 200 were all science and maths based subjects. These were agriculture, chemical engineering, mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, physics, materials science, pharmacy, chemistry and earth and marine science. The top universities for these subjects globally were all institutions in the US. An analysis of the rankings also found that 19 of the top 50 universities for geography and 15 for English language and literature were in the UK, but only three for civil engineering, less than Hong Kong and Australia. In total, Asia had 10 of the top 30 institutions in the areas of chemical, civil and electrical engineering and eight for mechanical engineering. Atudents planning on careers in areas such as geography, history, English and modern languages should look at studying at Oxford or Cambridge . QS head of research Ben Sowter said: 'The UK remains second only to the US, but it now faces far stiffer competition in the STEM disciplines. 'The leading Asian institutions can now be considered serious global players, particularly in the fields of science and technology.' The QS rankings rated universities worldwide in 30 different subject disciplines, based on the opinions of academics and employers. The results also looked at the UK's national picture and found that on this measure, Cambridge outperformed Oxford. Only looking at UK institutions, Cambridge was ranked first nationally in 14 subject areas, while Oxford was top in 10. The London School of Economics was first for sociology, economics and communication and media studies, Edinburgh was top for linguistics, Reading for agriculture and the Institute of Education was first for education.","UK universities facing increasingly stiffer competition from other nations in science, technology, engineering and maths .

"Tragic: Alfred Wright, 28, pictured with one of his two young sons, was found half-naked and partially mutilated in the Texan outback . The FBI has launched an investigation into the death of a physiotherapist who vanished and was found dead in a desert three weeks later missing an ear, teeth and tongue. Alfred Wright, 28, was last seen at a petrol station near his home in Texas on November 7 as he drove to visit a patient. His disappearance sparked a large-scale manhunt, but police closed the case after two weeks. Days later, the father-of-two's family found him half-naked and mutilated in the East Texas outback where police claimed to have looked. Now, after two pathologists gave conflicting reports - one found the death to be an accident; another ruled Mr Wright suffered 'severe trauma' - the federal bureau has taken over the case, according to CNN. The family has also issued an appeal for any information about what they believe is a 'suspicious murder' that was motivated by race. They said married Mr Wright called his parents asking for a lift from CL&M Grocery in Jasper, Texas, because he had problems with his truck. By the time they arrived at 6pm, he had vanished. His watch and ID were found on a ranch the next day, which police searched and found nothing. The sheriff is said to have ruled there was 'no foul play' and attributed the death to drugs. Eventually, he was found wearing boxer shorts, tennis shoes and just one sock, with his phone tucked inside. He was missing an ear, two front teeth, and his throat appeared to be cut. Scroll down for video . Mysterious: The family is suspicious as two pathologists give conflicting reasons for Mr Wright's death . His father, Dominic Wright, told CNN: 'He was neatly laid.

An autopsy found the mutilations were caused by animal and insect activity. Action: Rep Sheila Jackson (right) has called for an urgent FBI investigation into the mysterious case . The coroner ruled the cause of death to be accidental caused by combined drug use after a toxicology report found his body to be filled with cocaine and methamphetamine.

"They say pride comes before a fall, but rarely do the falls come as big as the one which saw Fiji sevens player Semi Kunatani thrown  to the ground by Scotland's Lee Jones on Saturday. Fiji were taking on Calum MacRae's side in a Pool C clash at the Gold Coast Sevens in Australia when Kunatani burst through the Scottish defence for what looked like a certain try. But such was Kunatani's confidence that he stopped sprinting and sauntered past the try-line before stopping inside the in-goal area. Jones sensed what was happening and raced back to take out the Fijian with a brutally executed tackle. VIDEO: Never give up! Semi Kunatani gets clattered by  Lee Jones .

"A young British couple feared dead after blizzards and avalanches hit Nepal, killing at least 39 people, have turned up safe and well. Jade House, from Liphook, Hampshire, and Oliver De Paolis, from London, both 24, contacted their families to say they had been trekking in another part of the Himalayas when the disaster struck. There had also been concern for British advertising executive Lizi Hamer, 31, and her New Zealand-born wife, Lisa Walton, a former Olympic hockey player. Scroll down for video . Jade House and Oliver De Paolis, both 24, messaged families to say they were in different part of the Himalayas when snow storms and avalanches struck yesterday . Storms claimed the lives of at least 39 people yesterday near to Annapurna, but Miss House and Mr De Paolis were both elsewhere at the time . Ms Hamer, from Loughborough, and Ms Walton, 38, live in Singapore and had arrived in Nepal on Tuesday for a five-day hike. But yesterday it emerged they too had been at a safe distance from the Annapurna mountain when appalling weather descended last Wednesday, trapping hundreds of tourists and Nepalese guides. Annapurna is the world's tenth-highest mountain and Nepal's most popular trekking area. The trail goes through Dolpa district and can take up to 25 days to complete. Rescuers have pulled out more than 230 trekkers - most of them foreigners - since rescue efforts began on Wednesday. But they are still searching for more survivors, who are believed to be stranded in lodges and huts. Hiking remains difficult because of waist-deep snow. An unofficial list online names a number of Britons who are still unaccounted for, but also details some who have been deemed safe after making contact with their families. Lizi Hamer, 31, and wife Lisa Walton were also reported to be safe and well yesterday after tragedy . Relief: Ms Hamer, right, from Loughborough, and Ms Walton (left), 38, live in Singapore and had arrived in Nepal on Tuesday for a five-day hike. It emerged they had been a safe distance from the mountain . Among those named is 26-year-old Peter Roddis, an engineer from Hove, East Sussex. Jade House's mother, Angela, 48, said the couple had been taking a round-the-world trip after graduating from Birmingham University last year. 'I had a WhatsApp message from Jade saying, 'Just to let you know we are fine, far from the weather and avalanche'.' They were in Malaysia and Thailand before Nepal. 'Family and friends have been calling all day wondering if they're OK. I'm just relieved that they're safe.' 'Missing': Engineer Peter Roddis, 26, from Hove, East Sussex, is among those Britons still unaccounted for . The remoteness of the region can make it extremely difficult for trekkers to contact home, while others may have taken safe trekking routes but not yet returned. The parents of Nigel Vardy, 46, from Belper, Derbyshire, who was also thought to be missing, last night spoke of their relief at hearing he was alive. It is understood Mr Vardy, who calls himself Mr Frostbite, managed to post a message on Twitter telling them that he was OK. His mother Maureen said: 'The relief is enormous. Mountaineering is a good hobby for him but not for his mum and dad.' Experienced: The family of Nigel Vardy, pictured, last night spoke of their relief. Mr Vardy, 46, arrived to climb Himlung Himal in Nepal despite losing parts of his fingers, his nose and all of his toes to frostbite on a 1999 trek . Mr Vardy, an experienced mountain climber, left his home earlier this month to climb Himlung Himal in Nepal. He continued to climb despite losing parts of his fingers, his nose and all of his toes to frostbite on Mount McKinley in Alaska in 1999. His sister Amanda  said: 'The Britons that Nigel was with have all come back safe. We will get full confirmation when people have talked to him - so, good news.' Christopher Kneale said he spent days desperately attempting to contact his daughter, Clare Glazebrook, and her husband, Jamie, in the hope they had survived. Honeymoon: It is thought father-of-three Andy Kimmerling, pictured, was in the area with his wife Suzanne, whom he wed last month . He told the BBC he finally received an email confirming they were safe from the trekking company the couple were travelling with but has still been unable to contact them directly. Mr Kneale said: 'We've had to go through the trekking company who, I presume, have made contact with the Sherpas out there. It's been tense and horrific - not knowing was the worst.' Artist Katie Francis, 59, who was trekking with her husband Duncan Hedges, 55, of Malvern, Worcestershire, narrowly avoided being caught in the storms and spent 24 hours helping to treat victims of the avalanche. Among those Britons accounted for today is father-of-three Andy Kimmerling, who moved from Cambridge to France 15 years ago. It was feared that he had gone missing while on honeymoon with his wife Suzanne, whom he wed last month. But the 54-year-old's family today confirmed that the qualified mountaineering instructor was safe and had been having trouble with his phone signal. Mr Kimmerling, a management consultant, tried to climb Everest last year but had to turn around before he reached the summit. Among those who remain unaccounted for is Peter Roddis, 26, from Hove, East Sussex. His girlfriend, NHS clinical scientist Lisa Hallet, said she last spoke to him on Wednesday. She posted online: 'He said he was planning to head out that day or on Thursday, but I have not heard from him since.' Christopher Pugh and Martin Warner are listed as being from the UK and are also missing. The names of two other British nationals - Katie Hill and Jay Devine - were added to the unofficial list online last night. Anxious friends and family of Carole Starr, who is not on the list, said they had not heard from her in five days and feared she was in the area when the storms hit. She last contacted her family on Monday when she arrived in Pokhara, a town popular with tourists about to start the trail. A Nepalese soldier, pictured left, rescues an avalanche victim buried in the snow after finding him on Sunday . Nepalese soldiers carry the body of a victim of yesterday's blizzard into a helicopter as the death toll rises . Other survivors, suffering from  frostbite, have also made it to safety today as the death toll rose to 39 . Among those who have been confirmed dead were Canadians, Indians, Israelis, Slovaks and Poles. Fears for the missing climbers grew as nine bodies were spotted yesterday by a rescue helicopter. The steep terrain made it impossible for it to land, according to Yadav Koirala, from Katmandu's Disaster Management Division, but it was able to rescue three survivors. The Nepalese government has announced a high-level committee with two senior ministers to monitor and co-ordinate rescue efforts in what looks set to be the country's worst mountaineering tragedy. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office confirmed it is working with local authorities in Nepal to account for every Briton believed to be in the affected area. She added that embassy staff in the capital, Kathmandu, had not been informed of any British casualties.","Jade House and Oliver De Paolis, both 24, are safe after Nepal avalanche .

'We advertised it at the original price and didn’t find a buyer so reducing it made it far more attractive. 'Also, the stamp duty on properties over £2 million has gone up from five per cent to seven per cent, making them more expensive to buy. 'Houses slightly under two million therefore make it far more attractive to a buyer because the tax isn’t so much.

"Coffee chain Caffe Nero has not paid a penny in UK corporation tax since 2007 despite racking up around £100million in profits. The popular British coffee house has become the latest big firm to come under fire over its tax affairs, in the wake of US behemoths Starbucks, Amazon, and Google. One MP said the revelations over its tax affairs would be ‘hard to take’ for family-owned cafe owners around the country and accused Caffe Nero of ‘free-loading on the back of British taxpayers’. Criticised: The popular British coffee house, which has not paid corporation tax since 2007, has become the latest big firm to come under fire over its tax affairs, in the wake of US behemoths Starbucks, Amazon, and Google . The Italian-style coffee house has become a firm fixture on the High Street, with 566 outlets in the UK. Over the weekend the chain announced ambitious plans to open another 225 outlets over the next five years, creating 1,700 new jobs. It is also expanding into the US. But HM Revenue & Customs has very little to show from Caffe Nero’s breakneck expansion since it started life in 1997 as single coffee house in South Kensington. Analysis of its company accounts show it has not paid any tax since its financial year ending May 31, 2007. In the period since then it has notched up just under £1billion in sales and made profits before tax of around £100million. Latest filings to Companies House shows the privately-owned company made a £21.1million profit in the year ended May 31 2013 and generated £204.3million in sales. Founder, chief executive and chairman Gerry Ford has defended his business’s tax affairs, arguing profits have been wiped out by interest payments on its debts of £250million. Allegations: Founder, chief executive and chairman Gerry Ford has defended his business¿s tax affairs, arguing profits have been wiped out by interest payments on its debts of £250million . The 56-year-old entrepreneur also told . a Sunday newspaper that his firm’s complex structure, including the . decision to base its holding company in Luxemburg ‘has no implications . for our corporate tax at all’. He added: ‘It wasn’t set up as a financial engineering thing. We’re not in the same category as Starbucks.’ Mr . Ford, who owns 60pc of Caffe Nero since taking the company private in . 2007, added that the firm paid £21million in VAT last year and . £13million in National Insurance contributions. But last night the comments received short shrift from MPs and campaigners. John Mann, the Labour MP and member of the influential Treasury Select Committee said: . ‘Its unfair competition. If other cafes around the country including those owned by families are paying proper British taxes, why shouldn’t this company? I think people will be shocked to see Caffe Nero is free-loading on the back of the taxpayers’. Disappointed: John Mann, the Labour MP and member of the influential Treasury Select Committee said the news was 'hard to take' The issue of tax dodging by companies has soared up the political agenda, after revelations about a string of companies, including Starbucks, Google and Amazon sparked a public outcry. US coffee giant Starbucks provoked a furious backlash from MPs and the public after it emerged it paid nothing in UK corporation tax between 2009 and 2012, despite sales of £400million in 2011. It emerged that Starbucks reduced its tax bill by buying coffee beans for the UK through a Switzerland-based subsidiary and then roasting the beans in another subsidiary based in Amsterdam. It finally agreed to pay £20million in corporation tax by 2015, in a bid to restore its reputation. The Government has promised to crack down on companies and individuals using elaborate schemes to cut their tax bills. There is no suggestion that Cafe Nero is doing anything illegal. But Margaret Hodge, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee who last year grabbed headlines by branding Google’s tax dodging as ‘evil’, said: . ‘It’s still far too easy for global companies to structure themselves so they do not pay their fair share of taxes. It’s about time the Government matched up to their tough rhetoric and really clamped down on this.’","Coffee house latest firm to come under fir, joining Starbucks and Amazon .

"The husband of the teacher who cheated on him with her teenage students has vowed to stand by his 'wonderful, beautiful' wife during her stint in prison and rebuild his marriage once she is released. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Raphael Cooper said he realizes his wife made mistakes but he forgave her months ago. Wyoming Valley West High School English teacher Lauren Harrington-Cooper, 32, pleaded guilty last week to having sex with two students and flashing her breasts at a third. She was immediately jailed for a term of between nine and 23 months. Scroll down for video . Forgiveness: Cooper posted his most recent profile picture of the couple at the Parker Hill Community Church in Wilkes-Barre on September 15, the day after their baptism, knowing that within two weeks his wife would be imprisoned for having sex with her students . Sentenced: Lauren pleaded guilty last week and was immediately jailed for up to 23 months . Teacher's pet: Cooper told MailOnline that his wife will probably go into the dog grooming business once she is released from the Luzerne County Correctional Facility. She will no longer be able to teach . Now her husband, a dance school owner who once waltzed with Selena Gomez on the teen show 'Wizards of Waverly Place,' says he finds life is lonely without the woman he called the love of his life. Speaking on the doorstep of his home in Kingston, Pennsylvania, which backs on to the road opposite the football stadium where the Wyoming Valley West Spartans play their home games, Cooper, 32, said: 'She's a good person, but mistakes were made. 'Some of the things you have read are not true, but a plea is a plea, so I am not going to go into details. 'It's a very difficult situation. 'It's sad but we still have the hopes and dreams that we had when we first married,' Cooper, who is also a high school English teacher, added. He said there is no chance of the couple splitting up over Lauren's affairs with her students. 'She has always been a big support to me and I love this person. We are way past forgiveness, all we are doing now is focusing on our future.' Lauren resigned her job in January and has now had her teacher's license yanked. She will never be able to teach again as she has had to register as a sex offender. Her husband said she will probably go into the dog grooming business once she is released from the Luzerne County Correctional Facility. Lonely dancer: The dance school owner who once waltzed with Selena Gomez on the teen show Wizards of Waverly Place, says he finds life is lonely without the woman he calls the love of his life . Cooper said he hasn't yet seen his wife in jail, but only because his visiting hours have not come up yet. Harrington-Cooper was arrested in December after the parents of an 18-year-old student at her school in Plymouth, Pennsylvania, a 15-minute drive from her home, found inappropriate texts from her on the texting site 'Pinger.' 'When reviewing the text messages, the parents found their son was having a sexually explicit conversation with this school teacher,' the police affidavit reads. 'In the messages, the teacher is identified as Lauren with having Crohn's Disease, being a vegetarian and teaching 8th period in Room 401.' Harrington-Cooper had first met the boy after texting his sister, telling her she thought he was 'hot.' They had intercourse twice and she gave him oral sex three times, the affidavit says. Authorities later charged her with giving oral sex to a 17-year-old student. She was also charged with two counts of corrupting minors — boys aged 16 and 17. She flashed her breasts at one and 'had sexual contact' with the other. Police claim she told one student in class: 'All the candy you want is right here.' In a letter to Luzerne County Judge Michael Vough, Harrington-Cooper said she accepted responsibility for her actions and would use her time in prison to reflect on what she had done. She also apologized to the boys. Her attorney Joe D'Andrea told Vough that Harrington-Cooper suffered from 'self-image issues of acceptance and love.' Devoted: Last year Cooper posted a picture of them together with the caption: 'Loving every minute with my wonderful, beautiful wife, Lauren' Two to tango: Cooper runs a dance academy and Lauren taught there as well . 'She has been diagnosed with some significant psychological issues of inadequacy,' the lawyer said. 'You would think that she’s a pretty, young girl, that she would feel good about herself. But her self-esteem issues have really troubled her all of her life, and she found comfort and solace in some people giving her attention, as wrong as it was.' He said the case had strained her marriage and she wanted the case to be over quickly. 'She acted out on some serious impulses and hopefully therapy and some other things will help her through this.' Raphael Cooper confirmed that his wife of seven years is in therapy and said that they have both become more religious since the case first came to light. 'We were both baptized recently,' he said. 'She is in the bible a lot.' On his Facebook page, Raphael Cooper, who teaches in nearby Wilkes-Barre, still shows many pictures of him with his wife. He posted his most recent profile picture of the couple at the Parker Hill Community Church in Wilkes-Barre on September 15, the day after their baptism, knowing that within two weeks his wife would be imprisoned. Lessons learned: One of the 17-year-old victims told cops he began texting her last fall. On one occasion, he said, he picked her up from her home, drove her around for 90 minutes then returned to her home and sat kissing in the car. 'I knew she would go to jail,' he said 'It is not a terribly lengthy sentence, but it is very difficult,' he said. Judge Vough gave her the relatively lenient sentence at the request of the boys she had trysts with. On their wedding anniversary in August, he posted: 'My wife surprises me at a friends house with a thoughtful picnic w homemade food for our anniversary. Happy 7th! We have been through a lot! I love you, Lauren! Many more to come.' Last year he posted a picture of them together with the caption: 'Loving every minute with my wonderful, beautiful wife, Lauren.' Cooper said that despite his wife's unfaithfulness being big news, he has not been teased by his students. 'I have had great support from them, from the administration and the faculty,' he said. Cooper's devotion to his wife comes despite her brazenness. One of the 17-year-olds told cops he began texting her last fall. On one occasion, he said, he picked her up from her home, drove her around for 90 minutes then returned to her home and sat kissing in the car. Another time she performed oral sex on him in a car on a residential street.","Lauren Harrington-Cooper pleaded guilty in Pennsylvania to having sex with students in the Wyoming Valley West High School .

"Brutal: Rudy Eugene, 31, pictured in an old police mugshot, was shot dead by police in Miami, Florida yesterday following the horrific attack where he ripped pieces of flesh from his victim's face . This is the first look at the naked homeless man who ate another man's face while high on a new potent form of LSD. Rudy Eugene, 31, pictured in an old police mugshot was shot dead in Miami, Florida yesterday following the horrific attack where he ripped pieces of flesh from his victim. His victim, another naked homeless man, was in a serious condition in a Miami hospital today suffering from 'some of the worst injuries staff had ever encountered'. Yesterday, a cyclist described the terrifying moment he witnessed a naked man tear pieces of flesh from another man's face at the side of a freeway before being shot dead by police when he refused to stop. Larry Vega, from Miami, was cycling off the MacArthur Causeway on Saturday afternoon when he saw the savage attack, which he described as 'the most gruesome, traumatic thing I have ever seen in my life'. He told WSVN: 'The guy was like tearing him to pieces with his mouth and I told him to get off. But the guy just kept eating the other guy away, like ripping his skin. 'A police officer came over, told him several times to get off then climbed over the divider and got in front of him and said, ""Get off!"" But the guy just stood his head up like that with a piece of flesh in his mouth and growled.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Caught: Surveillance footage shows the two naked men after the attacker was shot by police . Down: Surveillance footage shows the two naked men lying on the walkway next to a major Miami highway, the unmoving body on the left is the attacker who has just been shot . Mr Vega said Eugene continued to eat his victim's face so he was shot repeatedly. Police have said they believe Eugene was high on a potent form of LSD at the time. His victim is in hospital recovering from his injuries which are said to be some of the most horrific staff have ever encountered. Images taken from a Miami Herald surveillance camera show the legs of the two men lying beneath a freeway underpass. Mr Vega described the crime scene - which he compared to a horror movie: 'It was just a blob of blood. You couldn't really see, it was just blood all over the place. 'It was one of the most gruesome things I have ever seen in my life in person. You know, you see these things in the movies but when you see it in person, it's pretty traumatic.' Shot dead: The 'cannibal' had to be shot several times before he was fatally wounded, while his victim lay in agony beside him . Zombie attacks: Recent assaults, like the gruesome face-chewing attack in Miami, are believed to have been caused by ingesting bath salts, a potent hallucinogen . Armando Aguilar of the Miami Fraternal Order of Police told WSVN: 'What's happening is whenever we see that a person has taken all of his clothes off and has become violent, it’s indicative of this excited delirium that's caused by overdose of drugs. 'What's happening is inside their body their organs are burning up alive.' A woman notified a police officer nearby that she had seen two men fighting, witnesses told The Miami Herald. In the barrage of gunfire, the naked man was killed, collapsing face-down on the pedestrian walkway right by the Herald's parking garage. Javier Ortiz, a police spokesman, said that based on information he's received, the officer who fired the shots 'is a hero and saved a life'. Growing concern: Police cars gather as the situation progresses . There were no weapons found near the two naked men, leading them to believe that the attacker used his own strength to subdue his victim. 'There are other ways to injure people,' Sergeant Altarr William told The Herald. 'Some people know martial arts, others are very strong and can kill you with their hands.' MacArthur Causeway is a major route that connects downtown Miami to popular South Beach. Traffic clogged the area for hours as people used the route to descend into South Beach for Urban Beach Week, an annual festival dedicated to hip-hop music.

"A drug smuggler pretended to be running a legitimate pharmaceuticals business while funding a lavish lifestyle trafficking narcotics from around the world. Damon Bolderson and his wife Paula, who had previously declared bankruptcy and lived off benefits, were able to spend thousands of pounds on exotic holidays, home furnishings and cosmetic surgery. But the pair have now been sentenced to years in jail after their smuggling operation was brought down, and could be forced to repay their ill-gotten gains. Jailed: Damon Bolderson, left, and his wife Pamela, right, have pleaded guilty to supplying drugs . Luxury: The pair, pictured on their wedding day, spent thousands on holidays and cosmetic surgery . Haul: Police found bags full of party drugs and cutting agents during a search of the couple's home . Before being caught, the Boldersons paid off the £140,000 mortgage on their suburban semi-detached home, bought a luxury caravan and furnished their house with gaming machines and a hot tub. They also spent £10,000 on a family holiday in the Mexican resort of Cancun, while Mrs Bolderson, 38, underwent a cosmetic surgery including Botox, lip fillers and tummy tucks. Mr Bolderson, 42, owned a black Range Rover which he nicknamed 'The Beast', and collected celebrity autographs and memorabilia. However, in April 2011 police investigating organised crime arrested the couple during a raid on their home in Stoke-on-Trent. They recovered 326kg of benzocaine, which is used to dilute drugs such as cocaine, worth £67,000, as well as £90,000 in cash - some of which was hidden in a handbag which had been stashed in a wardrobe. Home: Police raided the Boldersons' house in Stoke-on-Trent in April 2011 and found drugs . Car: The black Range Rover which Mr Bolderson nicknamed 'The Beast', bought with the proceeds of crime . Package: Border officials intercepted cutting agents sent to the Boldersons' home from China . Among the designer drugs found at the home were 130,000 'party drug' pills, 12kg of class C drug TFMPP and 5kg of BZP, imported from China, Hong Kong and Pakistan and worth more than £300,000. The Boldersons had tried to hide their deliveries and payments in small packages and DVD cases. At Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday, Mr Bolderson was jailed for eight years and Mrs Bolderson for four years, after pleading guilty to possessing drugs with intent to supply. Mr Bolderson used a pharmaceuticals firm, Global Medical Healthcare Products, to hide his buying and selling of chemicals such as benzocaine. Collector: Mr Bolderson spent  money on memorabilia such as this football shirt signed by Joe Cole . Signature: A cookbook signed by celebrity chef Gino D'Acampo was found at the couple's home . Fan: An Everton away shirt signed by players such as goalkeeper Neville Southall owned by Mr Bolderson . He set up a website which advertised the company as 'importers, exporters and suppliers of high branded products for the pharmaceutical industry'. The site claimed to be 'one of the leading pharmaceutical importers, exporters and suppliers of high branded products to the pharmaceutical industry' and boasted to be 'committed to supplying pharmacies and wholesalers with the highest quality branded and generic pharmaceutical products at the most competitive prices.' Mr Bolderson used fraudulent document to secure certificates from the Medical Health Regulatory Authority, and claimed on his website: 'We follow all applicable laws, supplying only quality products that are maintained and shipped under stringent guidelines and controls to ensure quality delivery, free from error or defect.' Officers from the UK Border Agency intercepted four packages of benzocaine and lignocaine sent to the Boldersons' home from China between October 2010 and March 2011, as well as emails Mr Bolderson sent to his clients in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.S. Drug: The Boldersons had substances used to dilute cocaine as well as designer drugs . International: Mr Bolderson had clients in the Netherlands, Germany and the U.S. as well as within Britain . Operation: Police raided their home after receiving a tip-off from the UK Border Agency . Antony Longworth, defending Mr Bolderson, said: 'He saw the opportunity of relatively easy money and took it. He made considerable profits in a short time.' Mrs Bolderson's lawyer Stuart Muldoon added: 'Her husband was the driving force.' But judge David Fletcher told her: 'You were not naive when in Cancun enjoying an expensive holiday, knowing your husband had bought your house in cash only two years after he had been adjudicated bankrupt and when on benefits.' Today Dave Hughes of Staffordshire Police said: 'The Boldersons were a seemingly normal couple but behind the facade of their unassuming home, they were in fact running an international drug trafficking business which was making them thousands. 'While Damon was the company executive, his wife acted as the company secretary and was fully aware of the illegal nature of the business. Lifestyle: The pair paid off the mortgage on their home, pictured, and bought a holiday caravan . Kitchen: The Boldersons now face the prospect of having their assets confiscated by the authorities . Garden: The couple lived an unassuming suburban life, including claiming benefits, before the smuggling . 'During our investigation we were not able to find any financial accounts or documentation to explain the business and a large amount of cash was recovered from the couple's home. It quickly became apparent that their pharmaceutical business was simply a cover for their criminal activity. 'We believe the drugs obtained by the Boldersons were headed for both local and international customers, including the benzocaine which was destined to dilute cocaine, increasing its profit margin on the streets. 'There is no doubt that our intervention and disruption of this activity will have a knock on affect on cocaine dealers' business, as they simply cannot operate without this cutting agent. 'It is also a stark warning to those who use or maybe considering using drugs - you simply don't know what you're taking or where it has come from. The dangers are unavoidable and it's simply not worth the risk.'","Damon and Paula Bolderson lived in a modest home in Stoke-on-Trent .

"Colombian legend Faustino Asprilla claims that Radamel Falcao’s relationship with Louis van Gaal is ‘broken’ and his compatriot will leave Manchester United when his loan from Monaco runs out at the end of the season. Falcao was said to be stunned when he was axed from United’s 18-man squad to face Southampton on Sunday after starting the previous five games, and held talks with Van Gaal at Carrington on Monday. It has raised serious doubts over United’s intention to go through with a permanent £52million deal, with Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes admitting that the 28-year-old might have to go elsewhere for regular first-team football. Radamel Falcao has struggled at Man United and there are doubts the striker will remain at Old Trafford . Faustino Asprilla claims Falcao's relationship with Van Gaal is broken . Asprilla, who had an eventful two-year stay at Newcastle in the 90s, has blamed Van Gaal over his treatment of Falcao and accused him of driving the player out of Old Trafford. ‘If Van Gaal continues he will leave,’ Asprilla told IB Times UK. ‘I think it is a relationship that has already been broken. Falcao understands that the coach does not want him. ‘I remember when I went to Newcastle Kevin Keegan wanted me. He supported me a lot and here it is obvious that Van Gaal does not trust Falcao. Falcao, pictured against Yeovil in the FA Cup, has only scored three goals since his move to United . Colombian Asprilla spent two eventful seasons playing in the Premier League with Newcastle . ‘It is sad to see how he is treating Falcao. The problem is not Falcao, but the coach. Falcao had an injury earlier in the season, but after he proved that he is still the same top scorer he used to be. ‘He played five games and scored goals. But this is all about giving him confidence. After playing well some games it is inexplicable that he suddenly stops playing. ‘The truth is that I do not know what Van Gaal is trying to do at United. And I think both players and fans are also confused. He does many changes without reasons.’","Radamel Falcao is currently on a season-long loan at Manchester United .

Also pictured are his son Jarod, far right, friend Tia Bakke and her boyfriend Jay Yust (left) Worried sick: Jarod Tonneson has spent the past four days giving out fliers in a desperate bid to locate his missing father . The Denver Police Department has issued a missing person's alert for Kitterman, describing him as 5ft. 7in. and weighing 190 lb. 'Paul Kitterman was last seen at about 8:00pm on Thursday, 10-23-14,' the alert says. 'He was wearing a dark colored hoody sweatshirt and Broncos ball cap.' A spokesperson for the Denver Police Department told MailOnline Monday morning that Kitterman's disappearance remains an active missing persons case, but they do not have any leads and they do not suspect foul play at this time. Kitterman, who is unmarried and lives alone in Kremmling, was at his first ever professional football game when he vanished. Bakke and her boyfriend Jay Yust - for whom Kitterman has worked for the last 10 years - had invited him to go to last Thursday's crunch AFC West face-off against the San Diego Chargers along with his 21-year-old son Jarod Tonneson. 'We are regulars, we are not season ticket holders, but this was the fourth Broncos game we have been to this season, and we have taken other friends with us before,' said Bakke. 'But Paul had never been to a game.' The friends couldn't get seats together so Bakke and Yust sat in one section of the Sports Authority Field at Mile High while Kitterman and his son went to another. Priorities: 'They say he is an adult and there is no sign of foul play so there is nothing much they can do,' Bakke told MailOnline. 'I am trying to maintain a positive, hopeful attitude, but I am very, very worried' Father and son: Jarod Tonneson (left) and Paul went with Tia Bakke and her boyfriend for their first Broncos game on Thursday . The foursome met up at half time when the Broncos were leading 14-7 — but that is the last time that Kitterman, who works on Yust's MY Ranch in Kremmling, Colorado, was seen. 'He was super-excited about the game. It was the first time he had been and the Broncos were ahead and playing well,' Bakke, 24, told MailOnline. 'Jarod needed to use the restroom and we left Paul waiting outside for him - it couldn't have been more than 10 feet from where we had been standing.' But when Jarod came out, his father was nowhere to be found so he went back to his seat in the south bleachers to watch the second half of the game, assuming he would soon join him. When the game ended in a 35-21 Bronco victory around 9.30 pm, Bakke called Tonneson telling him she and her 30-year-old boyfriend were waiting at Gate 8 ready for the two-hour drive back to Kremmling. 'He said he was waiting for Paul and asked me if he was with us, I said ""no, I thought he was with you"".' Mystery: Kitterman - pictured with Jarod at the game - did not have his cell phone or his credit cards with him when he vanished, Bakke said . For nearly three frantic hours the trio searched the 13-year-old, 76,000-capacity stadium with no luck. They called the police, local hospitals, even jails and detox facilities in the hope that someone could give them a lead. Tonneson told Denver's Fox affiliate, KDVR-TV he and his friends had looked in 'parking lots, trees, bushes, anywhere we could think of'. Eventually they left for the long journey home, hoping against hope that Paul would be waiting for them when they returned to Kremmling. Bakke called the frustrating days following the game 'the longest, most miserable days of her life'. In the ensuing days the mystery of Paul Kitterman's disappearance has only grown with no-one able to give any hint as to what happened to him. He did not have either his cell phone or credit cards with him, Bakke said. 'There is no way Paul would have deliberately disappeared,' Bakke told MailOnline. 'It is just not in his personality. There were no known medical problems or drug use in Paul's past that would lead him to disappear suddenly, said Bakke. She continued: 'He has worked for Jay for something like 10 years and he is extremely reliable. Paul is the most trustworthy person you could ever wish to meet. 'He would hate the fuss that is growing up around his disappearance. Paul is just not the type of person who would do something like this for attention. 'He would never deliberately let anyone worry about him, that is just not who he is,' she added. 'He never wants stress or heartache or anything like that. He is the type of person that if you are having a bad day will do anything he can to be there for you. Missing: Bakke told MailOnline that Kitterman said that it was uncharacteristic of him to disappear. She said he's 'extremely reliable. Paul is the most trustworthy person you could ever wish to meet' Vanished: Kitterman worked at a ranch owned by the friends he went to the game with. Bakke said: 'He would hate the fuss that is growing up around his disappearance' 'All he wants in his whole life is for everyone to be happy. He would never do anything to hurt anyone - especially his son. Jarod is just beside himself. There are no words to describe what he is going through. He is at a complete loss.' As for Bakke, she has no clue as to what could have happened to her friend. 'If he had somehow fallen they would have found him. If he gotten himself into a fight and got arrested there would be a record, same if he had ended up in hospital,' she said. 'We just have no idea what could possibly have happened to him.' • Anyone with information on Kitterman’s whereabouts is being asked to call Denver Police at 720-913-2000 .","Paul Kitterman, 53, was last seen by friends at a game at Mile High stadium in Denver on Thursday .

"Amanda Lindhout, the freelance Canadian journalist held captive in Somalia for 15 months, has spoken out about how she came to forgive the men who violently abused her - and even spoke to one of them on Facebook. The comments come as the 33-year-old's best-selling memoir, The House In The Sky, was picked up by a major Hollywood studio to be adapted as a film starring Academy Award nominee Rooney Mara. Lindhout and an Australian photographer, Nigel Brennan, were kidnapped by Islamic fundamentalists outside Mogadishu in August 2008. They were working on a story at the time and help hostage for 460 days. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Journalist Amanda Lindhout has spoken about coming to terms with the men who held her hostage and abused her for over a year in Somalia . Amanda Lindhour  (left) wrote on Facebook on June 26: 'Big news to announce! #ahouseinthesky has been optioned to film, with incredible, beautiful, actress Rooney Mara to star. Here we are last fall, when I spent a weekend in Maine with Rooney and my co-author Sara Corbett.' Ordeal: Lindhout wrote about being kidnapped along with photographer and ex-boyfriend Nigel Brennan (left) in her best-selling memoir, A House In The Sky . Amanda Lindhout and Nigel Brennan smile in November 2009 after being freed following 15 months in captivity . Lindhout said she concept of the 'house in the sky' is the place in her mind she turned to in order to survive the torment. 'It was my memory and my imagination,' she told Bangor Daily News. 'They helped me survive.' Not only has Lindhout survived, she says she has come to terms with the men who subjected her to endless sexual abuse. 'The reality of my experience was very violent,' she said. 'It was difficult to get through a day, and I didn’t know when, or if, it would end. 'It was almost constant abuse.' During the very darkest time, Lindhout had what she calls a 'moment of awakening'. 'Abdujllah was abusing me, he was hurting me, and I was protecting myself and had an almost out-of-body experience,' she said. Amanda Lindhour (right) seen here with Sara Corbett, the writer who co-authored The House In The Sky . 'I found myself looking down on myself on the floor.' Lindhout said she then realized her attacker knew only of violence. 'It’s pretty clear my captors were products of war and certainly had been shaped by that,' she says now. 'Having that understanding helped me. 'They’re human beings with painful stories of their own. It doesn’t make them innocent by any means, but they’re products of a culture of violence.' The book reveals how the families of the kidnapped pair eventually gave up on the Canadian and Australian governments and co-ordinated their release through a private hostage negotiator. About $600,000 went to the kidnappers and the same amount paid the negotiator's fees. They were finally freed in November 2009. Four and a half months later, Lindhout established the Global Enrichment Foundation, which provides higher education opportunities to women in Somalia. Volatile nation: Somalia is desperately poor and ravaged by terrorists, leaving the country so dangerous that even seasoned journalists fear to tread . One day, Lindhout opened Facebook only to see a message written by one of her captors. He praised her for her work in Somalia. 'The fact that they know about the work I’m doing now … that I have chosen compassion, that they could see that they didn’t break me — that’s the best justice I could have,' she said. The rights to The House In The Sky have now been picked up by Annapurna Pictures after a 'competitive pursuit'. The company has produced award-winning films such as American Hustle, Her and Zero Dark Thirty. Mara, who it is believed will play Lindhout, was nominated for an Academy Award in 2012 for her performance in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Rooney Mara attends the Calvin Klein party during the 67th Cannes Film Festival.

Friday on E! is 'Joan Rivers day' - with back-to-back episodes of Fashion Police and a 90-minute special of the show featuring Melissa Rivers and co-hosts Guiliana Rancic, Kelly Osbourne and George Kotsiopoulos. The marathon viewing will included Joan's birthday episode and also the last show she filmed. Ms Rivers passed away on September 4 at the age of 81 after slipping into a coma a week earlier following a throat procedure at a Manhattan clinic. Scroll down for video . Melissa Rivers pictured with her beloved mother Joan Rivers on May 15. Melissa thanked fans for the 'depth of love' expressed following the comedienne's death on Thursday . The special tribute will also include outtakes and never-before-seen footage, according to CBS. The E! Fashion Police episodes will air this Friday from 7am until 7pm before the 'Celebrating Joan' special at 8pm. On Wednesday evening, Melissa Rivers posted this message to her social media accounts: 'As my son Cooper and I mourn the loss of my mother, we want to thank everyone for the beautiful cards and flowers conveying heartfelt messages and condolences, which continue to arrive from around the world and through social media. 'My mother would have been overwhelmed by the scope and depth of the love that people have expressed for her. It is certainly helping to lift our spirits during this time. 'We are forever grateful for your kindness and support in continuing to honor my mother’s legacy, and for remembering the joy and laughter that she brought to so many.' Alongside her mother, Melissa Rivers hosted red-carpet fashion for the E! cable network. Last year, she co-created her mother's web show In Bed With Joan, a series of short interviews which starred Kathy Griffin, Sarah Silverman, Kelly Osbourne and Carmen Electra among many others. Melissa Rivers' emotional words came as new details emerged on Wednesday about the throat procedure which led the comedienne to slip into a coma last month. Dr Gwen Korovin, 56, is known as a 'throat specialist to the stars', and was in attendance during the procedure that led to Joan Rivers' death, MailOnline has learned. The doctor, who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist based in Manhattan. Joan Rivers, pictured with her Fashion Police co-hosts on E! - from left, Kelly Osbourne, guest Jessie J, George Kotsiopoulos and Guiliana Rancic . It is believed that Dr Korovin was at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 as Joan’s personal doctor when the legendary comedienne stopped breathing while undergoing a procedure on her vocal cords. Staff at Dr Korovin's offices on the Upper East Side of Manhattan refused to comment. CNN reported that a source close to the investigation into Joan's death being carried out by the New York State Department of Health said the star suffered a cardiac arrest as her personal doctor performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. A staff member at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor even took a 'selfie' photo in the procedure room while Joan was under anesthesia, the source said. Joan Rivers, 81, arrived at the Upper East side clinic for an endoscopy with gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, on the morning on August 28. The procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. Dr Gwen Korovin (pictured left) and Dr Lawrence Cohen (right) were both present when Joan Rivers went into cardiac arrest during a throat procedure at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic on August 28. Neither has been accused of wrongdoing . An ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - then performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords. The doctor was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist. CNN said that investigators believe that Joan's vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest. The comedienne was rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital from the clinic. However, she never regained consciousness and died on September 4 after being taken off life support and spending her final days with her daughter Melissa Rivers by her side and her loved ones paying their final respects. On Friday, Dr Cohen stepped down from his position at the medical center. A Yorkville spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline: 'Dr Cohen is not currently performing procedures at Yorkville Endoscopy; nor is he currently serving as medical director.’ Sources told ABC news that Dr Cohen had allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the clinic, to examine Joan. Neither Dr Cohen nor the specialist have been accused of wrongdoing. Today, the New York State Department of Health, in a statement to People, said: 'The State Department of Health's investigation is ongoing. As this is an open investigation, DOH cannot comment on any specifics regarding the investigation.'","Friday on E! is 'Joan Rivers day' - with back-to-back episodes of Fashion Police and 90-minute special of the show .

"Ministers are to axe Labour’s disastrous £12billion NHS computer scheme. The Coalition will today announce it is putting a halt to years of scandalous waste of taxpayers’ money on a system that never worked. It will cut its losses and ‘urgently’ dismantle the National Programme for IT – a monument to Whitehall folly during Labour’s 13 years in power. Scandalous waste of money: The Coalition will announced today that the  NHS computer scheme will be 'urgently' dismantled as they try to halt losses thought to total £12.7bn - or the salaries of 60,000 nurses for a decade . The biggest civilian IT project of its kind in the world, it has already squandered at least £12.7billion. Some estimates put the cost far higher. Analysts say the sum would have paid the salaries of more than 60,000 nurses for a decade. It comes as Chancellor George Osborne has been warned he faces a £12billion black hole in his deficit reduction plan – the same amount as that lost to the NHS scheme. Following an official review, the ‘one size fits all’ IT project will be replaced by much cheaper regional initiatives, with hospitals and GPs choosing the IT system they need. The announcement follows strong . criticism from MPs who accused Labour of wasting a further £500million . of taxpayers’ money on a failed bid to set up a network of regional Fire . Brigade control centres. John Prescott, who as Deputy Prime . Minister ordered that scheme, blamed civil servants for the fiasco. He . told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme they had kept ministers in the dark . over the ‘unbelievable’ scale of the ‘disaster’. And a new national watchdog will be established to ensure such huge sums can never again be thrown away on uncosted IT projects. Labour’s National Programme for IT . included a range of schemes to modernise the Health Service, including a . national email system and the ability to transfer X-rays and . prescriptions electronically. Health Minister Andrew Lansley, left, and his colleague Francis Maude are responsible for the decision to speed up the dismantling of the computer scheme . It also included the ‘electronic care record’, a process allowing hospitals and surgeries to share patients’ medical information, but which was criticised by the British Medical Association for putting privacy at risk. The decision to accelerate the dismantling of the scheme has been made by Health Secretary Andrew Lansley and Francis Maude, the Minister for the Cabinet Office. It follows new advice produced by the Major Projects Authority, set up by the Coalition to review Labour’s big financial commitments to see if they provide value for money. The authority said the IT scheme, set up in 2002, is not fit to provide services to the NHS – which as part of austerity measures has to make savings of £20billion by 2014/15. It concluded: ‘There can be no confidence that the programme has delivered or can be delivered as originally conceived.’ The report, seen by the Mail, recommends the Government should ‘dismember the programme and reconstitute it under new management and organisation arrangements’. It concluded: ‘The project has not delivered in line with the original intent as targets on dates, functionality, usage and levels of benefit have been delayed and reduced. ‘It is not possible to identify a documented business case for the whole of the programme.Unless the work is refocused it is hard to see how the perception can ever be shifted from the faults of the past and allowed to progress effectively to support the delivery of effective healthcare.’ Mr Lansley said: ‘Labour’s IT programme let down the NHS and wasted taxpayers’ money by imposing a top-down IT system on the local NHS, which didn’t fit their needs. ‘We will be moving to an innovative new system driven by local decision-making. This is the only way to make sure we get value for money from IT systems that better meet the needs of a modernised NHS.’ Mr Maude, who is in charge of Government procurement, will chair a new ‘oversight committee’ working to ensure that best value for taxpayers is gained from all contracts. As part of the axing of the IT scheme, the board which runs the project will be scrapped. In future, the NHS will be able to buy IT systems locally, without a national system being imposed centrally. Trusts will be able to share patient information if they wish to do so. Earlier this year, the powerful Commons public accounts committee slammed Labour’s NHS IT programme as ‘unworkable’. Its report said that despite the huge cost, it had ‘proved beyond the capacity of the Department to deliver, and the Department is no longer delivering a universal system’. And in May, the National Audit Office criticised the project for being poor value for money, patchy and long overdue. When the IT scheme was launched, it had a budget of £6.2billion. The NAO later said the cost had soared to £12.7billion, adding: ‘There remains some uncertainty around estimates of costs.’","Sum would pay 60,000 nurses' salaries for a decade .

"Before the digital camera was ubiquitous, photographs were such a rarity that people used to dress in their finery for their snapshots. And these smartly dressed prisoners were no exception as this haul of vintage mugshots shows.

The vintage portraits of thieves, poachers and murderers were snapped in the jail between 1859 and 1876. And, while their crimes may vary - from stealing spades to conning people while dressed as a vicar - what links them is that the majority are sharply dressed, with ties and buttoned up shirts and neatly combed hair. The book of mugshots is held by . Bedfordshire and Luton Archives and Records Service - which was the . first local record office in the UK and is now celebrating its . centenary. It was . the idea of Robert Evan Roberts, the governor of Bedford Prison in the . 1850s, who became concerned that too many habitual criminals were . getting away. The police had . previously relied on written descriptions to help capture criminals, . but he believed these methods were too unreliable.

We were told by doctors many years ago that he may die at an early age. All these years we prayed for his long life.' Working it: Mr Dev poses with his friend Jatinder Batra while training at a Gym in Amritsar, India . Doctor Neeraj Chandan, one of the doctors treating Romeo all night at Satyam Hospital, said: 'He was brought to the hospital in an unconscious state. It was due to massive bleeding which had caused brain damage or aneurism bleeding. There were very rare chances of him surviving.' Mr Dev's best friend, Maninder Singh, 19, used to go to the gym together. He said: 'His death was a shocking moment, I just can't believe he's died. We never thought this day would come so soon. His small bat, his bikes and his bedroom at his home are only memories of him now.'

"It may be the happiest place on Earth, but the Magic Kingdom has become a little more restrictive for some children hoping to enjoy Disney's U.S. parks on their own. Beginning on March 23, anyone under the age of 14 must be accompanied by someone 14 years of age or older. Enforcement of the rule at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, and Disneyland in Anaheim, California, will be enforced solely by a park worker's own judgment on age.

Should children under the age of 14 be allowed to enter Disney parks alone? Should children under the age of 14 be allowed to enter Disney parks alone? Now share your opinion . Disneyland spokeswoman Suzi Brown told NBC News: 'If a cast member who is working at the front gates sees a guest who appears to be younger than 14 without someone who appears to be older than that, they will engage in a conversation with the guest.' She added that if an employee determines that the child is under 14, their parents will be contacted to pick them up. Prior to the announcement, Disney did not have any age restrictions for guests arriving solo. The new rule was established after Disney conducted a survey of its guests and contacted various child welfare associations, according to NBC News. Input from both led to the age requirement. Ms Brown also noted that 14 is the minimum age for babysitters, as recommended by the American Red Cross.

"Former Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill, who revealed this week that he had delivered the two fatal shots to Osama bin Laden, gave a motivational speech on Thursday evening - but did not mention the famous raid. O'Neill, 38, appeared on stage in Eastern Tennessee before a rapt audience where he told stories about combat in Afghanistan but did not mention shooting dead the al Qaeda leader. MailOnline revealed on Thursday that Rob O'Neill, a retired 16-year veteran of the elite squad, is the man who says he shot the al-Qaeda leader in the head to kill him. The retired SEAL, father to a ten-year-old daughter, skipped over the controversy surrounding his revelation last night and instead spoke to the audience about what he called the most 'painful' thing about being in the military. 'It's not getting shot at, or things blowing up next to you,' O'Neill said. 'It's kissing your kid goodbye for what could be the very last time and you're both aware of it.' Scroll down for video . Retired Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill appeared on stage in Blount County, Tennessee before a rapt audience where he told stories about combat in Afghanistan - but did not mention shooting dead Osama bin Laden . MailOnline revealed on Thursday that Rob O'Neill (pictured on stage on Thursday evening) a retired 16-year veteran of the elite squad, is the man who says he shot the al-Qaeda leader in the head . Robert O'Neill a former Navy Seal team member, poses for a photo in Butte, Montana last year. O'Neill publicly identified himself on Thursday as the man who shot bin Laden in the head . Although he did not mention the bin Laden raid from 2011, he alluded to the mission WBIR reported, joking at the start of his speech: 'So I've been busy preparing this speech today. I've had my phone and computer off. Anything interesting on the internet?' The veteran received a standing ovation from the packed audience in Blount County on Thursday night and if they were disappointed to miss out on details of the 9/11 mastermind's death they gave no sign of it as they left the auditorium. 'He was just amazing. I appreciate Mr O'Neill's service to our country,' one man said. Others called O'Neill 'inspirational'. But O'Neill going public as the SEAL Team Six member who killed America's public enemy number one has sparked a whispering campaign from other SEALs claiming that his account of the killing is not truthful. His identity had been a closely-guarded secret but O'Neill is due to reveal his account in an interview with Fox News next week. O'Neill said more and more people were becoming aware of his role and that his name was bound to become public anyway. Today it became clear that other SEALs are about to accuse him of lying - although there is agreement that he was on the raid. SEAL Team Six member Rob O'Neill was revealed by MailOnline to be the serviceman who is to be interviewed by Fox News next week, going public on his role in the raid which killed Osama bin Laden . A SEAL source told MailOnline: 'The real shooter would never discuss it publicly. 'Members of SEAL Team Six haven’t discussed it publicly so there’s a reasonable chance he’s not being truthful. 'There is no way O’Neill could really prove it was he who took the fatal shot on Osama bin Laden unless his comrades all attested to it. 'But again, the code of secrecy with these special operators would preclude that.' A second source told MailOnline that other SEALs were expected to speak out anonymously against O'Neill. Although some special operations service members and veterans are unhappy that one of their own has taken credit publicly for killing  bin Laden, others said they have gotten used to the idea that their brethren might break the code of silence and seek to profit from their deeds. That internal debate gained intensity this week after retired Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill acknowledged that he had fired two rounds into the forehead of the al-Qaeda leader during the 2011 raid on his secret compound in Pakistan. O'Neill had recounted his version of the bin Laden raid in February 2013 to Esquire magazine, which identified him only as 'the shooter.' In a story on Thursday, The Washington Post identified him by name as he described shooting the leader of the terrorist group behind the attacks of September 11, 2001. One current and one former SEAL confirmed that O'Neill was long known to have killed bin Laden. Defense Department officials confirmed that O'Neill was a member of SEAL Team Six and was part of the raid but they said they could not confirm who fired the fatal shot, noting that other SEALs on the mission also fired at bin Laden. If O'Neill discloses classified information during the interviews he could be subject to an investigation or action by the Justice Department, the Defense Department officials said. O'Neill told the Post that shots also were fired by two other SEAL team members, including Matt Bissonnette, who described the raid somewhat differently in his book 'No Easy Day.' The fatigue shirt worn by Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill during the mission to capture Osama bin Laden,  in a case at the September 11 museum in New York . His lawyer said Bissonnette is under federal criminal investigation over whether he disclosed classified information in the book, which he did not vet with the military. In the Esquire piece, O'Neill makes no mention of Bissonnette shooting bin Laden. Well before the Post interview, O'Neill discussed his role in the raid during a private meeting with relatives of victims of the 9/11 attack on New York's World Trade Center before the recent opening of the National September 11 Memorial Museum. He donated the shirt he was wearing in the operation, which is now on display there. O'Neill is scheduled to be featured in lengthy segments next week on Fox News. He told the Post he decided to go public because he feared his identity was going to be leaked by others. Indeed, his name appeared on Monday on the website SOFREP, which is operated by former special operations troops. The actions of both O'Neill and Bissonnette have drawn scorn from some of their colleagues. In an October 31 open letter, Rear Adm. Brian Losey, who commands the Naval Special Warfare Group, and Force Master Chief Michael Magaraci, the top noncommissioned officer of the group, urged SEALs to lower their public profile. Their comments were widely perceived as being aimed at O'Neill and Bissonnette. 'At Naval Special Warfare's core is the SEAL ethos,' the letter says. 'A critical tenant of our ethos is ''I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions.''' The letter added: 'We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety or financial gain.' Debra Burlingame, whose brother Charles Burlingame was the pilot of the hijacked plane that crashed into the Pentagon, attended the 9/11 museum ceremony. She said O'Neill, whose name was not divulged at the event, offered the families clarity on conflicting information they had received about the raid. She said she didn't have an opinion about whether SEALs should disclose information about their deeds. 'Whatever that (SEALs') ethos is, is between the SEALS,' she said. 'The 9/11 families are the beneficiaries of any rules he might have broken or whatever lines he might have crossed.' 'He went through the mission in really in great detail. All that information was very helpful to me because this is a figure in a terror organization that has loomed large in our lives,' she said, adding that she listened to him so intently that the 9/11 commemorative coin she was clasping tightly in her hand left a bruise. Rick Woolard, a former SEAL team commander who previously urged his comrades to avoid discussing recent operations, said active-duty SEALs are 'pretty much very disappointed and I'd have to say angry with guys who have used their deeds and those of their companions for personal gain.' A framed Montana Standard newspaper article on Robert O'Neill, signed by O'Neill, is seen on the wall of the Metals Sports Bar in Butte . 'No Easy Day' was published in 2012 under the pseudonym Mark Owen. Bissonnette recounted on CBS's 60 Minutes that he sent a text to the commander of SEAL Team Six after its publication. He said the commander replied: 'Delete me.' At the same time, Woolard said, there is frustration among some special operations soldiers that senior government officials have left office and written memoirs revealing and profiting from actions involving troops who are sworn to secrecy. However, one active-duty SEAL officer, who declined to be quoted by name because he had no permission to speak publicly, said some SEALs had grown accustomed to some of their members seeking to profit from their connections to the elite group, upon retirement. Senior Pentagon and CIA officials cooperated extensively with the makers of Zero Dark Thirty, a film that depicted both the CIA's years-long hunt for bin Laden and the SEALs raid that killed him in Pakistan. In the Esquire piece, O'Neill said he was one of two SEALs who went up to the third floor of the building where bin Laden was hiding. The first man fired two shots at bin Laden as he peeked out of the bedroom, but O'Neill says those shots missed. The man then tackled two women in the hallway outside of bin Laden's bedroom. O'Neill went into the bedroom, he recounts. 'There was bin Laden standing there. He had his hands on a woman's shoulders, pushing her ahead, not exactly toward me but by me, in the direction of the hallway commotion. It was his youngest wife, Amal.' O'Neill added: 'In that second, I shot him two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again. Bap! Same place. ... He was dead.' Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.

"Iconic images from the early days of photography - including portraits of Queen Victoria, and the first ever picture of a hippopotamus - are to be showcased in a new exhibition. Drawn by Light will open the archives of The Royal Photographic Society, home to one of the world's most important photography collections, many of which were gifted by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Among the collection are pioneering images from the earliest days of the art form - including pictures of a young Victoria taken in 1856,  and a picture of a snoozing, smiling hippopotamus taken at London Zoo. Work from pioneers including Alice In Wonderland author Lewis Carroll, as well as modern artists including Don McCullin, Terry O'Neill and Martin Parr will also feature at the Science Museum, in South Kensington. The archives of the Royal Photographic Society have been opened to the public offering a fascinating insight into the history of photography. The display includes one of the earliest albumen print photographs of Queen Victoria taken by Roger Fenton in about 1856. It shows Queen Victoria sat in profile in a chair, holding a letter in her lap. She and Prince Albert both took an enthusiastic interest in photography, and in 1853 they agreed to become patrons of the newly formed Photographic Society . The Hippopotamus at the Zoological Gardens, 1852, taken by Juan Carlos Maria Isidro, Count de Montizon de Borbon. The snoozing creature was pictured at London Zoo and is believed to be the first photograph of a hippo ever taken. The beast was kidnapped in August 1849 from the banks of the White Nile and sent over to Queen Victoria by the Egyptian Pasha and later became a much-loved celebrity of the time . Afghan Girl, Pakistan, 1984, by Steve McCurry, is perhaps one of the most iconic images of the collection. Sharbat Gula was pictured at Nasir Bagh refugee camp near Peshawar, in Pakistan, and became known as the Green-eyed Afghan girl and 'the First World's Third World Mona Lisa' - a symbol in the late twentieth century of strength and beauty in the face of hardship . Soldiers of the Sky, 1940, by Nickolas Muray. An early advertising image, thought to have been commissioned for American propaganda purposes, showing the role of women in the war effort. Muray was based in the States and was an early pioneer of colour photography . Portrait of Christina, Lieutenant Colonel Mervyn O'Gorman, taken around 1913. The close-up portrait of O’Gorman’s daughter was dramatic and unusual for the time. It was taken on the beach at Lulworth Cove, Dorset, during a family holiday. Christina featured in much of O'Gorman's work. As well as his military career O'Gorman also had artistic interests and was known as somewhat of a dandy . Light and Shade in Leicester Square, 1896, Paul Martin, paints London in a magical light.  Paul Martin was one of the first photo journalists and used a hand-held camera for this image taken at night . Fading Away, 1858, Henry Peach Robinson, shows a young girl on her deathbed, dying of consumption, and surrounded by her family. It is an example of combination printing, and five different negatives were used to make one complete print. The print was controversial when it was exhibited, with many believing death was not a suitable subject for photography . A member of the warden's service fitting a gas mask, 1944, a photograph by John Hinde. The picture was taken as part of an illustration for the book Citizens at War - showing the role that civilians had in defence. Born into a Quaker community, Hinde became a photographer for the civil defence forces instead of a soldier. He was one of the pioneers of early colour photography . A fire guard, pictured in 1944, by John Hinde. After the war, Hinde became well known for his series of postcards of 1950s Britain. From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, Hinde worked on  the Butlin Holiday Camps postcards . Audrey Hepburn, 1950, by Angus McBean. This was one of the earliest and most iconic images of Hepburn -  taken before she was a well-known film star, while she was a mere bit-part actress and a model. The image was used for advertising Crookes Lacto-Calamine  in Vogue magazine . Nude on Sand - Oceano, California, 1936, Edward Weston. Weston and his muse took the California sand dunes for this work, which had not been intended to be shot in the nude. But his model, Charis Wilson, who later became his wife, spontaneously took her clothes off and rolled down the sand dune - resulting in this iconic image . Sepervivum Percarneum, 1922, Albert Renger-Patzsch.  Renger-Patzsch was a German photographer who made it his life's work to react against pictorialism, instead striving to create a faithful objective vision of the world. This piece was used in his book - The World is Beautfiul . Another image by John Hinde of a simple lettuce set against soil. Curator Colin Harding said it was included in the exhibition to demonstrate the breadth of subject matter that Hinde looked at in his colourful works . Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico, 1941, by Ansel Adams. Another iconic image,  taken late in the afternoon from a layby on Route 84.The photograph became so popular that Adams made over 1,300 photographic prints of it during his long career . Chimney, 1934, by Noel Griggs. This image was an unusual concept for audiences of the 1930s, taking for its subject an everyday object - a chimney . War photographer Larry Burrows on assignment in Vietnam. The photographer, who features in the exhibition, donated a set of prints to the society in 1970. Just one year later he was killed in a helicopter crash in the Vietnam war . The Two Ways of Life, 1857, by Oscar Rejlander, created a great stir in the 1850s. The image is made of many separate negatives, printed together to create a staged tableau. The picture is an allegory - look to the right, and the subjects are portraying thrift, industry, compassion. To the left can be seen those of indulgence, gluttony and sin. It caused controversy because of the nudity it included. But when Queen Victoria visited the exhibiton she and Prince Albert loved it so much she bought a print of it and gave it to Royal Collection . The Turkish Bath, 1986, Calum Colvin.

"The smell of success: The intrepid Kelly Rose Bradford . Sliding into my train seat, I discreetly whipped out the bottle and applied a few judicious squirts. The man sitting opposite looked up. ‘Mmm, that’s nice,’ he said as the fragrance wafted under his nose . Was it my imagination or was that a cheeky twinkle in his eye? As a single mum, one week shy of my 40th birthday, I had invested heavily in the new Escentric range of pheromone-based products in a bid to succeed where dating sites had resolutely failed. The magic ingredient in their Molecules body wash (£25, Harvey Nichols) and Molecule 01 perfume (from £39.50 Harvey Nichols) is ISO E Super, an aroma-chemical which, despite sounding like an engine oil, is said to mimic human pheromones — the chemicals which make us attractive to the opposite sex. In his new book, The Compatability Gene, Professor Daniel Davis explains how smell is genetically paramount in how attractive we judge a prospective partner. Buoyed up by the science, I swapped my usual £1 lemon shower cream for the £25 Escentric body wash. It has a woody, almost masculine aroma. On the way to my first meeting I caught the attention of a portly man in his late 50s with slip-on shoes and a garish shirt — precisely the type of man I would usually swerve to avoid in a bar. He wandered over  and engaged me for 15 minutes in lively chit-chat. When we parted he gave a little nod and wink but, although proof the pheromones were doing their job, he wasn’t exactly the kind of mate I was hoping to attract. My meeting was with a male  colleague to discuss a project. Although he is married with three children — a total no-go area — it seemed a waste not to preface our platonic lunch with a squirt of the perfume. It had little effect but when I got up to leave, he kissed my cheek politely and said: . ‘Oooh, you smell lovely. Really good.’ The new Escentric range of pheromone-based products, which contain  ISO E Super, an aroma-chemical which is said to mimic human pheromones . I spritzed on some more before the school run in the hope of luring the attention of single dads collecting their children. But aside from one fellow mum wrinkling her nose, the scattering of dads didn’t even give me a second glance, or sniff. Later, I unleashed some more pheromones before my eveing date. I arrived at the bar and went for the direct approach. ‘Do you like my perfume?’ I asked, as we sat down and our legs brushed. He pressed his nose against the bare skin on my neck and nodded. My heart fluttered. At last, a man reduced to a rubble of desire as advertised. ‘Nice,’ he said. ‘Just like an old Routemaster bus.

"A secret letter has revealed police have been investigating News International directors since 2012 for hacking scandal . A secret letter has revealed that Scotland Yard started investigating whether Rupert Murdoch and other News International directors had knowledge of bribes and phone hacking two years ago. A secret document sent by the Met to Mr Murdoch's lawyers in 2012 confirms they are probing whether he and others, including former chairman Les Hinton, should be held to account after Andy Coulson was found guilty of leading a conspiracy to hack phones at the the News of the World last week. The ABC's 4 Corners show has obtained a copy of the letter, which reporter Marian Wilkinson said the investigation was 'completely separate' to the one that brought a criminal conviction against former News of the World editor Andy Coulson earlier this month. Ms Wilkinson said the confidential . note, to be made public in tonight's documentary, shows that the phone . hacking investigation 'could now well continue' and that the liability . of Rupert Murdoch and his directors - including Mr Hinton - looks set to . be the next avenue that police pursue. 'It is far from over,' Ms Wilkinson told Daily Mail Australia. 'This . (letter) wasn't part of the criminal investigation into journalists, . it's a separate investigation into the responsibility of the (News . International) board of directors.' Mr Murdoch, 83, is waiting to learn if News UK will face corporate charges over the phone hacking scandal, after Mr Coulson was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones at his trial last Tuesday. He has reportedly been told by Scotland Yard that detectives want to interview him under caution as part of their investigation into alleged wrongdoing at the company. Police have already interviewed Les Hinton, the former chairman of News International and Mr Murdoch’s right-hand man for decades, under caution in September 2012. Mr Murdoch’s son James, a former executive chairman at News International, may also be questioned. Scotland Yard has refused to comment. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Former News of the World editor and political spin doctor Andy Coulson could be jailed for two years . Sue Akers sent the confidential letter to Mr Murdoch's top London lawyer letting him know that police were investigating the 'corporate liability of News International' in relation to phone hacking and bribes to police . Former News International Chairman Les Hinton has already been interviewed by police over the hacking and bribery allegations . The letter, written by retired deputy assistant police commissioner Sue Akers and sent to Murdoch's legal adviser, Lord Grabiner QC, states that on May 18 2012 police were pursuing an 'active investigation into the corporate liability of News International in relation to phone hacking and illegal payments to public officials.' Ms Wilkinson said at this point, the . former News International chairman Les Hinton had already been . interviewed by police regarding phone hacking and bribery at the . company. The ABC reported on its website . that News International directors had been fully cooperative with the . British police investigation into phone-hacking and pay-offs to police . by Murdoch journalists. Ms . Wilkinson said directors were 'shocked' to hear that police were . investigating their involvement and that lawyers believed UK police . would not pursue corporate charges against News International, Mr . Murdoch's UK company, which ran the News of the World and The Sun. Dozens . of News Of The World reporters have been charged or remain on bail . accused of hacking phones and bribing public officials, but this letter . is separate to the individual cases brought against journalists and . instead looks at the involvement of company directors. Ms Wilkinson said the the letter was sent to Murdoch's lawyer just six months before News Corporation split into two companies - its publishing arm, News Corporation, and his entertainment venture, 21st Century Fox. The splitting of News Corp was long demanded by shareholders, but had been resisted by Mr Murdoch until 2012. It went ahead last year and has proved enormously successful for the Murdoch family and 21st Century Fox. British Labour MP Chris Bryant, a victim of phone-hacking, told Four Corners he was aware police were considering bringing charges against members of the board. 'I know prosecuting authorities in this country and the United States of America are seriously considering bringing charges against members of the board of the UK company and the American company, News Corp,' he said. MailOnline has contacted News UK for comment. The ABC investigation, Rupert, Rebekah and Andy will air on ABC1's Four Corners program at 8.30pm tonight.","ABC has obtained a letter confirming police investigation of News International directors .

"When Max Payne was released all those years ago on PS2, a well-known gaming website recommended you bought on that console it if was the only means of playing the game. See, Max Payne was a PC title, ported and scaled down for console - and during that transition, the quality of the experience suffered slightly. The same is true of the Battlefield games. If you're after jaw-dropping visuals, photo-realistic character models and want to see the Frostbite 3 Engine in all of its glory, either wait for next-generation offerings or play it on a high-powered PC. If you can't wait that long, current-gen will suffice - but expect the overall experience to take a hit. Stunning: to get the best out of Battlefield 4, you must play it on a high-end PC or wait for next-gen consoles . At its core, BF4 is a multiplayer game, and this is by far its strongest hand. There are 10 maps in total, all perfectly designed to cater to your gameplay style - whether that's finding a 'quiet' spot and sniping enemies with a high-powered rifle, dog-fighting in a jet-plane or engaging in naval combat. Destructive environments make a comeback, but its 'Levolution' that steals the show. This introduces massive, destructive events that drastically change the map when certain criteria are met. These events are best discovered for yourself, even if they become slightly predictable the more you play. There are also plenty of new modes from Obliteration - that sees two sides fighting to defuse a bomb, to Commander, that caters to the ever-growing second-screen gaming market. The latter sees you get a tactical map of the battlefield where you can direct your team to different points of interest, send in supplies and warn your troops of impending attacks. There's no ignoring the fact that the campaign, although incredibly entertaining while it lasts, ultimately feels tacked on. It's not helped by a stats counter, rewarding you for killing foes and headshots, that seems completely out of place and acts as a reminder that this is multiplayer game at heart. Any emotional punch the plot tries to deliver is hence crushed as enemies are not seen as 'living things' but a means of ending the level with the highest score possible. Still, the five-or-so-hour-long single-player is leagues better than its predecessor's bland effort, featuring set-pieces that give even the most far-fetched Call of Duty moments a run for their money. Plus, it even features a more than capable performance from its leading men, particularly The Wire's Michael K Williams. A blast: the single-player story may be lacking in emotion, but it's still a very enjoyable, five-hour thrill ride . Sadly, there's no avoiding the AI problems. Enemies will run right past your teammates and make a beeline for you, take cover right next to your squad mates and launch grenades at every given minute. These gripes don't massively detract from the experience, but are noticeable throughout the entire campaign. Even so, Battlefield 4 is a compelling package - one that serves to satisfy both those waiting for a full-fat Call of Duty: Ghosts campaign, and keen multiplayer gamers. Battlefield 4 is out now.

"A third teenager is to be charged in the case of a Massachusetts teenager who was allegedly sexually assaulted and left for dead in woods near Saugus. Video clips showing the intoxicated 16-year-old girl's ordeal were then distributed on Snapchat. All three of the accused teenagers involved in the crime are now being held without bail. Timothy Cyckowski, 17, faces charges of kidnapping and posing a child in a state of nudity, according to Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett's office. Authorities allege Cyckowski used the Snapchat application to send a young woman at least four videos of a girl she knew being sexually assaulted . The latest suspect,Timothy Cyckowski, 17, faces charges of kidnapping and posing a child in a state of nudity, according to Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett's office. Two other Saugus residents, Rashad Deihim, 19, and Kailyn Bonia, 18, have also been charged. Authorities allege Cyckowski used the Snapchat application to send a young woman at least four videos of a girl she knew being sexually assaulted. Prosecutors say the assault took place September 3rd behind Waybright Elementary School in Saugus. The victim in the video was so intoxicated that she could not speak or stand up, prosecutors say. The young woman who received the videos is credited with alerting police to the incident. Deadly trio: All three suspects are seen here chilling. Kailyn Bonia, 18, (left) is now in custody alongside a Rashad Deihim, 19, (middle) and Timothy Cyckowski,17 (right) who are all accused of the brutal crime . Timothy Cyckowski,17, who sent the Snapchat videos to a friend of the victim's can be 'heard in the background laughing in the videos.' The woman managed to capture screenshots of the video clips which normally disappear within seconds of being sent, and convinced Cyckowski to disclose his location, prosecutors say. Authorities say if she had not notified police, the teenager being assaulted in the video would have likely died. Defense attorney Eitan Goldberg argued Thursday that Cyckowski should be released to home confinement under GPS monitoring because 'his role was significantly less' than his co-defendants, Bonia and Deihim. But Assistant District Attorney Kate MacDougall said Cyckowski was essentially 'cheering on' the alleged assault. Suspect Rashad Deihim, 19, (pictured in September had been on the run for weeks, turned himself into police . Suspect Rashad Deihim, 19, (left) is now in custody alongside Kailyn Bonia, 18, (right) and a minor co-defendant, aged 17. Police found the severely intoxicated 16-year-old after a friend of the victim saw the graphic footage on Snapchat and recognized the location before leading police to the scene . Cyckowski's parents were in the courtroom for today's hearing. The teen's father, 37-year-old Matthew Cyckowski, has also been charged. A grand jury indicted the elder Cyckowski last month on one count of misleading police. Prosecutors allege the elder Cyckowski got rid of the cellphone that could link his son to the crime. They say when police asked for his son's cellphone, the elder Cyckowski turned over his own phone, saying it belonged to the boy. Prior to handing in the phone, he transferred his son's telephone number to his own phone, according to prosecutors. It was revealed that Cyckowski threw away his phone after the incident and even got his dad to lie to police . Authorities believe the cellphone has been destroyed and will not be recovered. Police found the severely intoxicated 16-year-old after a friend of the victim saw the graphic footage on the video and photo-sharing app recognized the location and led them to the scene. Court documents state the girl was foaming at the mouth when she arrived at hospital, possibly on a narcotic and had cuts all over body  - when detectives interviewed her days later she could not recalled what had happened. The victim's mother told WHDH, her daughter was drugged, sexually assaulted and left for dead. 'What they did was disgusting it was sick, I almost lost my daughter,' the mother said. 'She was barely breathing she was found with nothing on.' 'She had fingerprints, at least two hands held down by her throat. ' Police found the girl partially-naked and covered in cuts and bruises in woods behind Waybright Elementary School (pictured) in Sangus, Massachusetts . 'Her breasts were bruised, her whole body was ripped, shredded, broken toes.' 'Somebody noticed who it was and called the cops, and if this person didn't call the cops my daughter wouldn't be here right now,' the mom said. Yesterday Assistant Essex District Attorney Erin Bellavia stated graphic details of the video, in which she said Deihim can be clearly identified, reports the Boston Herald. Deihim had his pants unzipped and suspect  Bonia can be 'seen wrapping her arms around the victim's neck as if she was strangling her while grabbing at the victim's naked body,' Bellavia said. Deihim (pictured) and Bonia are charged with assault with intent to rape, indecent assault and battery on a person 14 or older, posing a child in a state of nudity and kidnapping . Deihim, who denies the charges, was deemed dangerous and held without bail alongside Bonia . 'She attempted to run away naked in one of the videos but she could not because she was so impaired,' Bellavia said and added that she is seen shaking her head as if to to protest against their actions. Bellavia said Timothy Cyckowski,17, who sent the Snapchat videos to a friend of the victim's can be 'heard in the background laughing in the videos.' Deihim and Bonia are charged with assault with intent to rape, indecent assault and battery on a person 14 or older, posing a child in a state of nudity and kidnapping. Timothy Cyckowski is charged as a juvenile with identical charges and distribution of child pornography. The victim's mother is calling for the trio to be charged with attempted murder saying: 'Somebody noticed who it was and called the cops, and if this person didn't call the cops my daughter wouldn't be here right now,' A report by an officer who arrived at the scene said: 'The female appeared to be extremely intoxicated. 'I conducted a search of the area and located what we believe is the scene where the sexual activity took place on a floral print couch in the wooded area about 100 feet from the baseball field.' Lynn court records show Deihim has been the subject of four restraining orders, according to the Boston Globe - one on behalf of a younger sibling, one from his mother, and two for a female Saugus High student . The victim's friend who received the Snapchat videos took screen shots, according to a police report. The victim's friend asked the juvenile defendant where he was and he said, 'Waybright, but then realized he gave up where they were and panicked,' the report said. The two friends spoke after the victim was released from the hospital which is when the victim thanked the girl 'for saving her life,' the report said.","Severely intoxicated girl, 16 was found by police behind Waybright Elementary School in Saugus, Massachusetts .

"The worst thing about Batman: Arkham Origins isn't the predicable gameplay, lack of invention and a general failure to evolve the series. These elements, although frustrating, still don't make it a bad game. No. The major annoyance here comes in the way the game was released to reviewers. Given the worldwide embargo on Friday (which coincided with the game's release), many publishers were given just hours to play and review it before racing to get their opinions up before anyone else. Danger from above: combat still remains fun, but by the end of the game you're left wanting something new . How any of those publications who received the game on Friday and managed to write a review on the same day is baffling... Especially given how much there is to do... Still, skepticism aside, put a decent amount of time into Arkham Origins and you'll be handsomely rewarded. There are plenty of Enigma quests, side missions, optional crime in progress quests and that's not even scratching the game's surface. Plot follows a 30-something-year-old Batman who's on the hunt for Black Mask - a ruthless anti-hero who's put a price on the Dark Knight's head. He's even enlisted the help of several unsavoury characters, such as Deathstroke and Deadshot, who are all fighting over who takes home the $50million bounty. So, Smokin' Aces in Gotham City it is, then. Not the how-Bruce-Wayne-became-Batman story many fans were hoping for... Gameplay is more of the same - namely, focusing on knocking out baddies using a free-flow counter-centered combat system. It's still rewarding taking out 10 thugs unscathed and amassing a large combo, but there's no ignoring the fact that it's starting to become stale. To mix things up, new enemy types, in particular, the martial artist - throw in new defensive abilities, but these are soon quickly telegraphed. Surpisingly, although the staple batarangs, cryptographic scanner and explosive gel (complete with trademark awful-looking explosion) pull their weight, the newer gadgets are so unbalanced that they're not as fun to use. Shock and awe: the Shock Gauntlets are incredibly unbalanced and can wipe out most foes with ease . Shock Gauntlets, for example, that are unlocked later in the game, allow you to wipe out hordes of goons with ease. What has been improved, though - at least on a superficial level - are the crime scene investigations. Here, you can use your evidence scanner to rebuild the scene of a crime - rewinding and fast-forwarding to look for clues. It's stunning to behold - even though it's essentially a simple 'find the clues' premise. Visually, the game looks superb on the most part, with one noticeable caveat... Gotham City is completely lifeless. There's no sense that you're flying around a living, breathing city - rather a map with monster closets and goon patrols scattered around. We've seen with the likes of GTA V that such a premise isn't beyond current gen's power, so there really is no excuse. Cut-scenes are noticeable prettier, though, opting for a more CGI-stylised look than the previous game's slightly tarted-up Unreal Engine 3's offerings. Animation remains strong throughout - especially notable during the game's (mostly) entertaining boss battles. A run-in with Deathstroke is particularly memorable - mixing quick-fire combos and gadgets with frenetic countering sequences. The best bits: although many missions see you fly to a place and beat up thugs, it still looks very stylish . For the first time in the series, there is also a multiplayer - which supports up to eight players. But this afterthought is not likely to win over new fans to the franchise. Nor, sadly, will the predictable single player. Still, Arkham Origins is a solid game...even though it may be time to draw this saga to a close...

"Black Flag may seem like an act of desperation from Ubisoft, hoping to get the Assassin’s Creed franchise back on track, but this is the best Assassin’s Creed title to date and one of the finest releases we’ve seen in 2013. Assassin’s Creed 4 is what Assassin’s Creed 3 should have been. Players aren’t hamstrung by a four hour prologue, nor are they tirelessly waiting for their character to find his groove. With blunderbuss in hand, Edward Kenway holds the player to rights from the game’s opening moments and holds off on pulling the trigger until the final credits roll. Stunning: whether you play it on this generation of console or wait for the next, Black Flag looks great . Black Flag takes you back to the 17th Century where a pirate’s life seemed to be for everyone. As Edward Kenway, a native Welshman swabbing the decks and gulleys of a large privateer vessel, players will stumble upon the infamous Assassin’s order and suddenly embark on a whirlwind journey of fame and fortune. Chartering his own vessel, Kenway can take to the Seven Seas with reckless abandon, whether it’s firing down navy fleets, pillaging resources, plundering gold or discovering hidden islands rich with opportunity. By heading out on to the open seas, Assassin’s Creed 4 presents players with new opportunities. Rather than the vast, bustling cities we’ve been used to in the past, Black Flag offers smaller ports, each with unique, hidden secrets. There are also Naval Contracts available with financial incentives attached. Naval forts can be overrun and used to establish a foothold on the open waters. But to do so, you'll have to deal with challenging weather conditions and intimidating wildlife, such as sharks. Fortunately, Kenway can always keep ship-shape with a series of improvements, such as fortifying the hull, increasing the number of sails and improving weapon competency. Kenway can also rescue stranded sailors and invite them onboard to increase ship productivity. He can even force his crew to break out into a rendition of ‘Drunken Sailor’ Despite that, AC4 isn’t a radical departure. The game is still taking cues from its predecessors, managing to encompass the best bits of Connor’s adventure last year, such as tree-hop free-running, hunting, skinning and crafting, as well as familiar series staples from previous iterations, such as assassin contracts and challenges. Best one yet: some were let down with AC3 but Black Flag is a stronger game in almost every single way . And, of course, it wouldn’t be Assassin’s Creed without denizens of collectibles to find. Whether you’re downloading emails and historical data from Abstergo or chasing Sea Shanties, moving marker stones for Mayan Keys or digging for buried treasure, Black Flag has an enormous sandbox environment to explore. The biggest in the series’ history. But it’s the graphics in Black Flag that really make Kenway’s adventure stand out. Whether you’re walking along golden sands, swimming through the wavy, murky waters, or standing outside in the middle of a terrible thunderstorm, these supposedly dated systems ooze elegance that seems almost impossible from eight-year-old hardware. Ubisoft have confidently steered the stormy seas and put Assassin’s Creed back on track. For the naysayers and doubters who claim the series has fatigued, Black Flag is an absolute pleasure to play; completely refreshing, exhilarating and infinitely rewarding. However you choose to play, Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag is a perfect swan-song for this generation of systems, and a faultless introduction for the next. Absolute pleasure: some may think this is just another update, but there's so much more than meets the eye .

"A police force has admitted they were told Jimmy Savile was a paedophile nearly a decade before his horrific crimes came to light, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Surrey Police have disclosed that a journalist called them in 2003 with information that an unnamed victim had been abused by Savile as a child in London – but the force did nothing with the information. The call only emerged after an examination of police phone records in November last year, long after Savile was unmasked as the UK's most notorious paedophile. Scroll down for video . Surrey Police have disclosed that a journalist called them in 2003 with information that an unnamed victim had been abused by Savile as a child in London – but the force did nothing with the information . Surrey have now asked an external force to investigate whether there were any other missed opportunities which may have resulted from earlier investigations. The 2003 call came in the middle of Operation Arundel, an investigation which led to former pop mogul Jonathan King and DJ Chris Denning being convicted of child abuse. Records show that police operators asked the journalist to encourage the victim to contact them or the Metropolitan Police. But Surrey said no crime record was created as 'no direct allegation was ever received' and Savile was not a suspect in the Arundel inquiry. The new revelation is hugely embarrassing for the force, who previously admitted they identified Savile as a potential abuser in 2007, but botched the subsequent investigation. Savile was interviewed  by Surrey officers  about sexual assault allegations. But no charges were brought after the Crown Prosecution Service advised there was insufficient evidence . Savile was interviewed under caution by Surrey officers that year about sexual assault allegations dating back to the 1970s. But no charges were brought after the Crown Prosecution Service advised there was insufficient evidence. It has since emerged that Surrey officers overlooked key evidence during the investigation, codenamed Operation Ornament, from 2007 to 2009. It was only during a 2012 review that the force discovered the 2003 call, but when the force then published a report on the review last January, it failed to mention it. The omission was spotted in November 2013 and led to the force referring the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which oversaw the investigation but cleared Surrey of any wrongdoing. The Mail on Sunday understands the blunder led Surrey to commission an independent report by Merseyside Police, which is currently being assessed. But last night Labour MP Simon Danczuk said: 'This is yet another revelation showing the casual attitude of police towards this crime at the time. It's important we know why information relating to credible tip-offs was not acted on so we can establish what the police knew about Savile. Only then will we be able to learn lessons so that other powerful abusers cannot slip through the net.' A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'The call from the journalist came during the force's investigation into historical sexual offences known as Operation Arundel. Savile was not a suspect in this investigation. 'Material relating to Operation Arundel has been shared with Operation Yewtree as part of their on-going enquiries. Surrey Police commissioned an independent external review of Operation Arundel by Merseyside Police and are in the process of assessing a report from that.'","Surrey Police admitted they were told Savile was a paedophile in 2003 .

Out of this world: the opening level is stunning but the other set-pieces just don't pack as much punch . COD purists, then, will feel right at home here. From the stunning opening level to abseiling down an enormous skyscraper, you can't fault Infinity Ward for trying to make things as varied as possible. There are even some new gameplay tweaks, notably in the use of the dog, Riley. With a click of the button you can 'sync' up with him and scope out enemy strongholds. Sadly, it's all very linear and scripted - involving sneaking up to an enemy before unleashing a silent takedown. Good effort: There's no denying that Infinity Ward has tried to bring something new to the table, but they've raised the bar so high previously that it's almost impossible to do that without re-inventing the series . Riley's animation, though, is superb - and, coupled with the odd whimper and nervous bark every now and then, Infinity Ward convey some of his character, too. Other more devastating weapons, from a remote sniper to the more familiar aerial drones, can also be used. Turtle Beach have released their new EarForce Spectre headset, packed full of features to help make your COD experience as good as possible. There's the usual Dynamic Chat Boost to block out noise and distractions, while adjustable bass and treble can be tweaked for extra realism. They're comfy, too - having been tested on our PC for hours, with very little ear fatigue. You can even take phone calls when playing and separate game and chat volume. At £124 they aren't cheap - but rest assured, you'll avoid annoying your nearest and dearest with gunfire sounds flooding your house. Unfortunately, that's about it in terms of fresh single-player content. Gunplay and level design are as expected - ushering you through each stage and often culminating in a set-piece. It's a formula that has proved successful, but even by last year's brilliant Black Ops II, it was starting to become stale. BLOPS II overcame that by adding fresh mechanics, player-choice and a vastly-improved multiplayer - proving that there was still some life in the series. Ghosts, however, seems to have taken a step back - incorporating almost nothing Treyarch did to evolve the series. As a result, there's an over-reliance on set-pieces that no longer have that 'wow' factor. Where free-falling from a building sounds amazing, for example, you're merely watching the AI have all the fun before being prompted to press a button and end the level. Battlefield 4 (dare I say it) may not have held a torch to COD's single-player in the past, but some of the scripted, all-action moments in its latest incarnate are equal to or surpass Ghosts. This COD, more than ever, feels like a shooting gallery nestled in cliche. Setting up turrets to defend positions. Countless 'one-last-stand-slow-motion' sequences. Monster closets. It's all here, and sadly, it's all too predicable to enjoy. Battle to survive: Extinction mode puts you in a team of four who have to fight aliens . Plus, the laughable AI - programmed to flank at whatever the cost - isn't quite as evolved as many would like. What is noticeably better, though, are the visuals - thanks to a modified IW 4.0 Engine. Current-gen versions may notice a slight difference, but it's on PC (and soon to be next gen) where we're given a glimpse of how good COD can look. To call it a true next-gen game would be slightly misleading as strictly-speaking, it's using a modified version of an older engine. Still, whether it's looking out over a . vast city-scape, or floating through space hundreds of miles above . Earth, graphics have a crispness previously lacking in the other games. Battle lines: Battlefield 4's campaign (above) has clearly been influenced by Call of Duty, and while the last game's single-player paled in comparison to COD, this year's incarnate provides similar thrills . Facial animations, although not quiet Battlefield 4 standard, are incredibly convincing, too. Multiplayer is another area where Ghosts excels. Standard fare modes return, while dynamic maps and new player movements, such as sliding and leaning around corners, bring something new to the table. There's plenty of customisation, new . killstreaks and game-types, not to mention more interactive . environments. Notably, Extinction makes its debut - where four players . have to fight aliens in a post-apocalyptic world. So, is it worth buying? Well, if you're . the kind of person who'd go to the cinema and see a good movie twice, . then yes. After all, why should Infinity Ward change something that's . won over millions of fans? Don't look down: running down this building is fun while it lasts, but still feels overly familiar . However, if you're starting to get bored, give Battlefield 4 a try. With a solid campaign and exceptional multiplayer, it comes out on top. Next-gen wargames have started... and for now, it's advantage Battlefield. Call of Duty: Ghosts is out now.

"Three college friends from Iowa who spotted a buck trapped in a sinkhole on their way to a football game were struck by pangs of guilt as they drove on by so decided to turn around and save the deer. Before attempting their selfless rescue mission, Gavin Nimrod, Eric Smorstad and Bryton Meyer made a pit-stop at Wal-Mart to get rope and clips and made their way back to the field owned by Eric's father. Once there the friends made quick work of the task at hand, pulling the deer out of the 10-foot-deep hole using only a rope and their bare hands. Scroll Down for Video . Rescuers: The three friends assess the situation after to save the buck which had fallen down the sinkhole . Obviously the antlers and the scared deer made their rescue dangerous, so the friends had to work a slip knot to the deer which would come free once they had pulled it out of its hole. 'I was almost down to my knees reaching down in there, so they jumped on my legs to keep me from falling in,' said Nimrod, 20, to the Des Moines Register. 'It was just something you don't get the opportunity to do, rescue a deer. So you get the chance and you take it.' Meyer positioned his smartphone onto the truck to record the rescue, which happened last month. Heave: The three friends begin to drag the deer to safety carefully pulling on the buck's antlers . Up and away: The friends dart away from the deer as it bolts straight out of the sinkhole after getting trapped . Laughter: Once free the friends begin shouting out their delight at having rescued the deer from the hole . The three friends later posted the footage onto YouTube and it has been viewed more than 30,000 times since. The friends managed to yank the startled buck up by its antlers inch by inch, taking care to position themselves away from the deer so that they could run if it charged. Once it reached the top it darted right then left and bolted away, leaving its amused rescuers shouting at the top of their voices at their own effort. 'The animal was in distress. These kids took a shot at it and in this case you've got to say they did the right thing,' said Joe Wilkinson, an Iowa Department of Natural Resources spokesman to the Des Moines Register. According to the Des Moines Register, two of the men are in fact deer hunters, but they said in fact, that was what made them rescue the deer. 'Either one of us would have taken it if we had the opportunity to, so we wanted to let it live,' Nimrod said. 'It was the most fun we've had since we won the state in football.'","Gavin Nimrod, Eric Smorstad and Bryton Meyer filmed rescue last month .

"A Conservative MP who claims that he was falsely accused of sexually assaulting Nigel Farage’s ‘former mistress’ has spoken for the first time about how the incident cost him his marriage and family. Andrew Bridgen said that Annabelle Fuller, a Ukip spokeswoman, had ‘ruined his life’ after claiming she was groped on the balcony of his Westminster flat in June 2011. Police were told by an informant last month that Miss Fuller, 32, had concocted the claim after stealing his phone and later confessed she had ‘stitched him up’. Annabelle Fuller (left) who was named as a mistress of Nigel Farage (an allegation that they both deny) went to the Westminster flat of Tory MP Andrew Bridgen (with wife Jackie, right) and claimed that she was groped on his balcony. Mr Bridgen was arrested but the case was dropped within days and says the incident ruined his life and cost him his marriage . Last week it emerged that detectives have launched a formal investigation into the matter, and Miss Fuller could face being prosecuted for perverting the course of justice if the claims are proven. After leaving the House of Commons on June 8, 2011, Mr Bridgen stopped for a drink at the Marquis of Granby pub opposite his flat. He said that going to the pub ‘was probably the biggest mistake of my life’. After being introduced to Miss Fuller and meeting a civil servant at the pub, who was a mutual acquaintance, the three later went back to Mr Bridgen’s flat. Mr Bridgen said that Miss Fuller used the bathroom a number of times to make phone calls and on one occasion began complaining about a man she called ‘the bane of my life’. He said: ‘She added something about the difference between a girlfriend and a mistress is that a girlfriend can start to relax after the third or fourth date, but a mistress has to be perfect all the time.’ Mr Bridgen, 49, who now lives apart from his wife Jackie and their two sons, said he couldn’t talk much more about the incident because of an ongoing police investigation. After the balcony incident, Miss Fuller left the flat and within hours police had arrested Mr Bridgen. He spent ten hours being quizzed at a police station, where he had a DNA swab and his blood taken. The case was dropped within days when Miss Fuller gave police a statement saying that her behaviour could have been construed as flirting. Later that month, she chose to break the anonymity which is afforded to alleged victims reporting sexual offences to tell her story to a national newspaper. In that interview she claimed she grazed her head as she ran barefoot from the flat and a security guard made the call to police after seeing her distressed. She said she didn’t know Mr Bridgen was an MP when she met him in the pub and only  took the MP’s phone and Commons security pass as evidence of where she had been. She added she never wanted the case against the MP to go ahead and that she had been left ‘suicidal’ after Mr Bridgen threatened to sue over the false accusations. Six days after the incident, police told him they would not be pursuing the complaint, Mr Bridgen said,  but the damage to his reputation had been done as his name was already in the news. ‘Every time you Google my name that incident comes up,’ he said. Ukip leader Nigel Farage. Nikki Sinclaire, a transsexual former Ukip MEP, claimed that Annabelle Fuller was Mr Farage's mistress, an allegation that they both deny . ‘She waived her anonymity to give her salacious version of what happened. 'I never had the option of my name not appearing. ‘I was a falsely accused man with nowhere to hide. ‘Those two-and-a-half hours with Annabelle Fuller have ruined my life. 'The events of that night and the huge media intrusion of my wife and children that followed led to the end of my marriage.’ He added: ‘I believe the moment I was introduced to her as an MP  I was targeted.’ Last month, MEP Nikki Sinclaire – a former Ukip member – used parliamentary privilege to claim that Miss Fuller had been Mr Farage’s mistress. The pair have always denied the claims. Mr Bridgen added that he completely sympathised with former deputy speaker Nigel Evans, who was cleared in court of rape and other allegations on Thursday. A police spokesman last night said: ‘The Metropolitan Police received information relating to an alleged false claim of sexual assault. 'The man who was the subject of the allegedly false claim was informed that this has now moved forward into a formal police investigation.’ Last night, Annabelle Fuller said: ‘I have not been arrested, interviewed or questioned by police in regard to this matter.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Andrew Bridgen, MP met Annabelle Fuller in a pub across the road from his Westminster flat .

"The number of women over 50 who are having babies has more than doubled in five years. Every week around three children are born to a mother in her fifties, the latest figures show. The dramatic increase in births to older women will deepen fears over the health of both the mothers and their babies. The number of women aged 50 and over who gave birth in 2012 hit 154, up from 69 in 2008 . Older women are more likely to have . miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies while their  children are more . likely to be born with genetic abnormalities. Midwives also warn that because older . mothers and their offspring often require higher levels of care, extra . pressure is put on the NHS. Health . ministers revealed the sharp rise in older mothers in a parliamentary . question. In 2012, there were 154 babies born to mothers over the age of . 50, up by a third in a year. The figure has more than doubled since 2008 when there were 69 births to women aged 50 and over. In 2000 the number was 44. The . number of births to mothers aged 40 and over has also risen, up 13 per . cent from 26,419 in 2008 to 29,994 in 2012. It means one in 25 are to . mothers who have turned 40. Even someone who has a child aged over the age 35 is considered an ‘older mother’ by  medical professionals. Around 20 per cent of babies are born to women aged 35 or older, the highest proportion since records began in 1938. At the same time, only 23 per cent of births were to women aged under 25 in 2012, down from almost half in the early 1970s. In . some areas of Britain, including Windsor and Maidenhead, Brighton and . East  Renfrewshire, around one in three mothers  was over 35. The trend is the result of women choosing to concentrate on their careers rather than settling down to have a family. Happy: Carole Hobson with her two-year-old twins Freida and Matthew . Carole Hobson became Britain’s oldest mother of twins at 58 after conceiving through IVFat an Indian clinic. After four failed IVF attempts in Ukraine and Cyprus, donor embryos were implanted at a clinic in Mumbai. The . single mother, now 61, spent more than £20,000 to have children and . twins Frieda and Matthew were born by emergency Caesarean on Christmas . Eve 2010. Nine weeks premature and each weighing 3lb 3oz, they spent two months in neo-natal care. The . qualified barrister from Kent, said: ‘In Britain we need to be better . at providing for women who want to be mothers later in life. It is an indescribable joy, but it’s non-stop – it is like a full-time job.’ Treatment: Miss Hobson, now 61, spent more than £20,000 to have children and twins Frieda and Matthew were born by emergency Caesarean on Christmas Eve 2010 . Changing medical advice and advances in IVF treatment also mean more are willing to risk delaying having children. Other women are moving into new relationships later in life and are choosing to have more children with their new partner. Earlier . this year Shameless actress Tina Malone gave birth to daughter Flame at . the age of 50, after travelling to Cyprus for IVF treatment. In 2007, . Desperate Housewives star Marcia Cross had twin daughters in 2007 at the . age of 44. Louise . Silverton, director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives said: . ‘There are an increasing numbers of older women who are having babies . and these women tend to have more complications than younger women. ‘This . is more pronounced as women have babies at increasingly greater ages. Older mothers are more likely to have increased rates of miscarriage and . ectopic pregnancies and genetic problems in the child and other issues . such high blood pressure, diabetes and problems with the placenta.’ Shameless actress Tina Malone travelled to Cyprus for IVF treatment and conceived her daughter, Flame, with donor eggs, giving birth aged 50 . She . warned that without more midwives the health service would struggle to . cope with the changing patterns of women delaying motherhood. ‘Because . of these risks it is crucial that these women get the right level of . care, advice and support they need in their pregnancy. ‘Every . woman, no matter what her age, deserves the best possible care and this . is one of the reasons behind the RCM’s call for more midwives in the . NHS.’ The Royal College . of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has warned that those over the age . of 40 are up to three times more likely to lose their baby than younger . mothers. Their babies also face a greater risk of ill-health or . abnormalities such as Down’s Syndrome. Marcia Cross, pitured here in Desperate Housewives, had twin daughters in 2007 at the age of 44 . A . Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We know that more older women are . giving birth now than 20 years ago and research shows that older women . have a higher risk of developing complications during pregnancy and may . need more support. That is why we have invested in over 1,500 more midwives since 2010 with another 5,000 in training.‘This will ensure that every mother has a named midwife who is responsible for personalised care.’ Last . month a survey found almost three-quarters of people do not think women . should receive IVF to help them conceive beyond their natural . childbearing years. A quarter believe women should stop trying to bring . babies into the world past the age of 40. The . survey of more than 2,000 people across the UK found 31 per cent think . the current age limit of 42 for IVF on the NHS is too old. Josephine . Quintavalle of Comment on Reproductive Ethics said: ‘The older the . mother, the higher the risk of complications. Having a child at such an . old age also has implications on the time these mothers will have to . enjoying being a grandparent. ‘This . doubling of births to over-fifties isn’t something which would have . happened naturally, as there’s no way there has been that significant a . change in natural menopause in the past five years.’","154 babies born to over-50s mothers in 2012, official figures show .

"Thomas Eric Duncan is in critical but stable condition as his body battled Ebola . US Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan is now receiving doses of an experimental anti-viral drug as he continues to fight for his life in a Texas hospital. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital announced today that doctors had begun administering brincidofovir, which has shown promise in fighting the disease. The dug, developed by North Carolina-based Chimerix, is approved for the treatment of the herpes virus. Duncan's doctors got permission from the federal government to use the drug after his condition took a dramatic turn for the worse. President Barack Obama on Monday announced that his administration was working on ways to screen travelers for Ebola before they enter the U.S. in an effort to prevent any other people from bringing the disease over from West Africa. Currently, travelers are only screened in West Africa before they leave the Ebola-stricken nations of Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said today that he is 'very confident' that America's largest city could quickly contain an outbreak of Ebola. The city has had at least two Ebola scares from ill travelers from West Africa, but lab tests show the patients did not have the disease. Physicians had initially said that his body couldn't handle anti-viral drugs in critical condition and that they were providing only 'supportive care.' Duncan will not be receiving the 'miracle drug' ZMapp that cured American missionaries Dr Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol because there are no more doses of the serum left. The drug takes months to manufacture even very small quantities. Based on early-stage research by the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health, brincidofovir has shown that it kills the Ebola virus in the same way it fights the herpes and smallpox viruses. Chimerix and the FDA are working to finalize protocols to begin a clinical trial to determine whether the drug will work in Ebola patients. There is no proven cure for Ebola and currently the disease has a mortality rate of nearly 50percent. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved an emergency order allowing the drug to be given to Ebola patients. Cleaning up: Workers dress in full hazmat gear returned to the apartment where Duncan spent several days while contagious with Ebola and continued to sanitize it . Tagged and bagged: Workers brought out several items from the apartment. Duncan's girlfriend and her children were moved to a secret safe house . The Cleaning Guys, a Dallas contractor, was given the job of cleaning up the apartment after Duncan's girlfriend revealed his towels and sheets - likely infected with the virus, were still in the home . A third drug, TKM-Ebola, from a Canadian pharmaceutical company, has also been approved for use in Ebola patients, though a study of whether it's safe to use in healthy people was put on hold after some people in the clinical study developed flu-like symptoms. Ashoka Mukpo, the NBC News cameraman who was diagnosed with Ebola in Liberia last week, arrived today at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, one of four special treatment centers for infectious diseases in the U.S. Doctors there say they do no know yet whether he will be treated with any of the experimental medication.","The FDA gave emergency approval to give anti-viral drug brincidofovir to patients with Ebola .

"Day care owners who spent 21 years in prison before being freed amid questions over their convictions for child abuse involving satanic rituals are struggling to convince prosecutors that they should be fully exonerated. Dan and Fran Keller, who divorced in prison, were freed on bond last year when the only physical evidence against them was found to be a mistake. But prosecutors say to overcome a jury finding of guilt, the courts require new evidence that unquestionably establishes innocence such as an ironclad alibi or DNA proof. Fighting to clear his name: Dan Keller, 73, has appealed for a court to declare him innocent. He was released from jail in Austin, Texas, in 2013 after 21 years amid doubts over his sexual abuse conviction . The couple had been convicted in 1992 after therapists testified that they helped three children recover memories of satanic rituals and sexual abuse at an Austin preschool the Kellers operated. However, an appeal found the only physical evidence came from an emergency room doctor who testified that internal lacerations on one child were evidence of abuse. And children whose testimony led to a conviction have since claimed they were pressured to lie. The Kellers, who always denied the charges, want the courts to throw out their convictions. But a year after they were freed from prison, Travis County prosecutors remain unwilling to proclaim them innocent, the Austin American-Statesman reported Sunday. 'Our responsibility is to make sure the law is properly applied, and, under the applicable standards, we are not satisfied that they have established actual innocence under the law,' Travis County Assistant District Attorney Scott Taliaferro said. That standard seems unfair to Fran Keller, who said there is no way to conclusively prove a negative. 'It's so hard to prove you're innocent when there was never a crime,' she said. The Kellers had been sentenced to 48 years in prison. But in court documents filed in 2013, Dr. Michael Mouw says what he thought were lacerations were actually normal physiology. That prompted prosecutors in Travis County, which includes Austin, to agree that the case's evidence was faulty and release the two on bond. Evidence needed: Fran Keller and her ex-husband need concrete evidence proving their innocence to overthrow the jury's guilty verdict. The pair were jailed for allegedly engaging in satanic rituals and abuse . The Kellers' claim of innocence will be decided by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, where a core of conservative judges typically takes a skeptical view toward overturning jury verdicts. The court will be guided by the recommendations of Senior District Judge Wilford Flowers, who presided over the Kellers' 1992 trial and their recent appeals — and who has already twice ruled that they had failed to prove their innocence. Fran Keller's attorney, Keith Hampton, said: 'The case was a true witch hunt because the investigators actually believed that this was part of a wide satanic conspiracy.' He said the therapist's techniques — which were used to convince the children, parents and investigators that the Kellers committed human sacrifices, sexually abused them with pens and dismembered human bodies in cemeteries — have been debunked. The Kellers were sentenced after just a six-day trial, according to KUT. The couple were among hundreds of childcare workers who were accused of being part of a group of Satan worshipers who engaged in ritual child abuse across America during the 1980s and 1990s. 'The Keller case is definitely about the panic back then,' said Hampton. Between 1984 to 1989, some 100 people nationwide were charged with ritual sex abuse and 50 were put on trial, according to Debbie Nathan of the National Center for Reason and Justice, which works to free those wrongly imprisoned. Many have since questioned a number of the cases, which they said were based on faulty testimony coaxed out of children from purported experts on recovered memories and backed by dubious medical testimony on signs of sexual abuse.","Court needs concrete evidence proving innocence to overthrow verdict .

"Speaking at the Royal Academy of Music Elton John criticised modern pop songs as being 'too flawless' He has performed his vast repertoire of pop classics on the world’s stages for almost five decades. But in a wide ranging attack, Sir Elton John said today’s ‘processed performers’ such as Britney Spears lack the skill to perform live. And he dismissed the majority of contemporary pop hits as ‘packaged crap’ - while his songwriting is inspired by the likes of Bach and Beethoven. The 66-year-old songwriter, made the criticisms at the Royal Academy of Music, where he trained for six years from the age of 11. Speaking to the Sunday Times ahead of a private dinner, he cited a lifelong passion for classical music which in turn inspired his own music. He said; ‘If you love Bach, Mozart, Chopin and Beethoven, you can’t help but be influenced. They wrote the greatest melodies and the most beautiful things of all time.’ He complained that modern music stars lack the ‘soul and humanity’ of singers such as Judy Garland and Nina Simone. Sir Elton, said: ‘Everything’s too flawless now. Everything’s autotuned, there’s no trace of humanity. ‘If you go and see a Britney Spears concert, you might as well stay at home and watch the video.’ He said that in the past most singers could sing live, but ‘a lot of them can’t now - it’s a shocker.’ John, whose biggest hits include Candle in the Wind and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, believes that technology has created a generation of under-qualified stars. ‘Anyone can make a record in their living room or their bedroom, and it can be a very good record, but they don’t have the skill to go and play it live, to hone skills,’ he said. ‘It started with MTV, that’s when music started getting processed. You turn on Radio 1 and it’s mostly garbage. David Bowie made a great recent record; I don’t think Radio 1 played that. If it’s good music, play it. They shouldn’t be playing the packaged crap that they are now.’ The flamboyant Candle in the Wind singer singled out Britney Spears, saying that fans would be better off watching one of her concerts on the TV rather than going to see it . His criticisms were made ahead of a function at the Royal Academy of Music, attended by leading figures like impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh and benefactor Dame Vivien Duffield. They gathered to inaugurate a magnificent £1.2m organ for the Academy’s concert-hall, made possible by Sir Elton’s fund-raising concerts. He was aged 11 when he enrolled at the Academy as a classical music scholar, where he spent six years training. He argued that audiences want performances with ‘human soul’, in which mistakes might happen. He recalled how at a recent show he had tried out a new song that ‘was so bad that in the end I said, “Stop it, we just can’t play it”. ‘I wasn’t ashamed, because it was a new song, but it makes the audience aware that sometimes some things don’t work.’ He believes part of the problem lies with the ‘ageism’ of BBC radio. ‘You get a rock band like Arcade Fire. I love them so much, but they’re not played on Radio 1 because they’re too old, and they’re not played on Radio 2 because they’re not really Radio 2. John also criticised disc jockeys, adding: ‘I don’t think they’re really passionate about music . Disc jockeys of yore were passionate about what they played.’ John stressed the importance of radio in reaching audiences, citing the folk singer Laura Marling as the kind of ‘real musician’ Radio 1 should be playing. It was in 2004 that Sir Elton famously said that singers who mime ‘should be shot’ citing the example of Madonna, whose shows he claimed were heavily lip-synched.","Elton said autotune had lead to a lack of humanity in songs .

Hahn, 33, ended a wild day of multiple lead changes on a difficult Riviera Country Club layout in wet and cool conditions by edging out fellow American Dustin Johnson and England's Paul Casey for the win. Born in South Korea but educated in the United States, Hahn struck his tee shot at the third extra hole, the par-three 14th, to 24 feet and coolly sank the birdie putt before the long-hitting Johnson missed his attempt from 12 feet.

Casey was eliminated on the previous hole, the tricky par-four 10th, where Johnson and Hahn both hit superb lob wedges from wet rough to the back left of the green and sank their birdie putts. 'This is amazing,' an emotional Hahn told CBS Sports. 'I have a little girl coming in three weeks and I never would have thought I would win this golf tournament with so many great players here. 'I'm more excited about being a dad than winning any golf tournament,' he said shortly before the playoff. 'After today, I'm going to fly back home and spend some time with my wife. 'Pick up some money here, which is always nice, and be able to buy a lot of diapers the next couple weeks.' The trio had finished the 72 regulation holes on six-under-par 278, Johnson and Hahn each closing with a two-under 69 and Casey finishing bogey-birdie-birdie-bogey for a 68.

'I didn't deserve to win this week, it's as simple as that,' Garcia said. 'It caught up with me on the last, six, seven holes. It was already a good effort for me to have a chance.' Overnight leader Retief Goosen birdied the par-five first to briefly maintain his two-stroke cushion but his round then unravelled after he bogeyed the short fourth. The veteran South African, seeking his first PGA Tour win since the 2009, closed with a 75 that included double-bogeys at the eighth and 13th to finish in a tie for eighth. 'Obviously 13 was the killer,' said Goosen, a double U.S. Open winner. 'I'm kicking myself, that's for sure. That was an opportunity missed.'

"Mother Nature has created some mean running machines such as the ostrich, which has a top speed of 60mph (97km/h). And while robots are not quite at the point where they could beat some animals in a race, scientists have created an incredible running machine with six rotating legs. Taking inspiration from the natural world, the OutRunner is self-balancing and can reach speeds of 20mph (32km/h) on different terrains. Scroll down for video . Faster by foot: Taking inspiration from nature, the OutRunner robot (pictured) is self-balancing and can reach speeds of 20mph (32km/h) on different terrains. It will be the first commercially available running robot . Design: The robot is biologically inspired and is self-balancing. Legs: It has between six and 12 legs. Price: The OutRunner Core model costs $299 (£177) and the Performance model $799 (£473). Top Speed: The Core reached 10mph (16km/h) and the Performance 20mph (32km/h). Operation: Either remote control, or a smartphone app for the OutRunner Performance. Battery life: One hour for the Core and two hours for the Performance version. Height: The core measures 1.5ft (46cm) and the Performance is slightly larger at 2ft (60cm) Weight: 3lbs (1.4kg) for the Core and 5lbs (2.3kg) for the Performance. Camera: Both have the option to mount a camera and the OutRunner Performance comes with an HD camera built-in. Created by scientists at Robotics Unlimited, a spinoff of the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) in Pensacola, Florida, the robot claims to be the world’s first legged running robot that is commercially available to the public. The company is raising money on Kickstarter to put the robot into production and said: ‘There is simply no other robot with such capabilities and so easy and fun to play with. All you need to do is just press the accelerator and steer it wherever you want it to go; it's that easy.’ It is biologically inspired and emulates the behaviour of legged animals by reproducing their step pattern as well as having a similar mass to length distribution, the company explained. ‘By having a centre of mass lower than the leg axis of rotation, OutRunner robots exploit a buoyancy effect, making them inherently stable and eliminating the need for expensive sensors and complex control algorithms,’ they said. It claims to be energy efficient as the legs are used as energy storage systems, which allows for the conservation of kinetic energy during running. The robotics team proved the stability of the robot by creating a version that is able to run on four rotating legs. To steer the OutRunner, an owner uses a remote control to shift the mass of the robot by forcing it to lean to one side. This induces a turn, similar to steering a bicycle. The robot is available to pre-order in two versions: A core model for $299 (£177) and the ‘performance’ model for $799 (£473). Both are expected to be shipped in mid-2015. The core version will have a top speed of 10mph (16km/h) and a battery life of one hour. It will come with six legs and a camera mount and will be able to be operated using a remote control unit. Taking on mother nature: The robot (pictured) is biologically inspired and emulates the behaviour of legged animals by reproducing their step pattern as well as having a similar mass to length distribution, the company explained.

Both are expected to be shipped in mid-2015 . Measuring 1.5ft (46cm) tall, the commercial robot will weigh less than 3lbs (1.4kg). The more expensive Performance model is twice as fast and uses a powerful out-runner brushless motor. Its battery will last for two hours and users will be able to choose how many legs it has – from six to 12. They will be able to use a remote control or their smartphone to steer the machine, which has an on-board accelerometer, gyroscope and HD camera. Data from sensors and video footage will be streamed to a user’s smartphone using a Wi-Fi connection and hardware updates will be available to boost the robot’s performance. It measures 2ft (60cm) tall and weighs 5lbs (2.3kg). The firm plans on organising a competition for its running robots by the end of 2015.

"Wilfried Bony was the main man on Sunday as Ivory Coast beat Algeria 3-1 in the Africa Cup of Nations to set up a semi-final clash with Democratic Republic of Congo. Ivory Coast are contesting their first international competition without former talisman Didier Drogba since the 2002 Nations Cup. There were signs that they missed the Chelsea striker, who retired from international duty after last year's World Cup, during the group stage as they stuttered to draws against Guinea and Mali. Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony (left) shields the ball from Algeria defender Carl Medjani in Malabo . 'If Drogba is not here it's not because of us but because of him,' said coach Herve Renard. 'However if you lose Drogba and find Bony you're doing pretty well.' Against Algeria, Bony demonstrated that after flattering to deceive for the national side he is finally ready to take up Drogba's mantle. The new Manchester City signing scored two fine headers, from a Max Gradel cross and a Yaya Toure free kick, ensuring the Ivorians progressed to the semi-finals.

Bony wheels away to celebrate his second goal of the night, which turned out to be the winner . 'Bony was the top scorer in England in 2014,' Renard added. 'When you say that, you understand everything. 'Things are much easier when you have players of his and Gervinho's quality.' Gervinho, who scored a late third for Ivory Coast, also acknowledged that Bony's form was helping the team forget Drogba. Ex-Arsenal man Gervinho slots the ball into the bottom corner late on to seal Ivory Coast's victory . Gervinho and Co are through to the last four of the Africa Cup of Nations . 'We can't think about Drogba anymore,' he said. 'Bony is a different style of player he's a player who brings us another dimension.

"Britain's smallest home, which is less than half the size of a train carriage and measures just 188sq.ft, has sold for more than a quarter of a million pounds. The pint-sized property in Islington, north London, is a fifth of the size of the average new build but still crams in an open-plan kitchen, living area, bathroom and bedroom. Described by estate agents as 'unique', the cosy home – which has its front door underneath the bed – went on sale for £275,000 last month and has now been snapped up after receiving an astonishing amount of interest. Scroll down for video . The pint-sized property in Islington, north London, is a fifth of the size of the average new build but still crams in an open-plan kitchen, a tiny living area, a bathroom and 'bedroom'. It has been sold for in the region of £270,000 and gained interest from thousands of people . The bedroom, which is suspended above the front door, measures just 7ft 7ins xby 5ft 8ins in size but does come with storage space . The property, which is a converted flower shop and boasts some plants outside the front door, is on the highly sought-after Richmond Avenue, just one street away from Tony Blair's former house on Richmond Crescent. It is nestled between two several-storey houses . More than 220,000 people viewed the property's advert on Rightmove and Zoopla and, after a flurry of enquiries and a number of offers, the converted flower shop was sold. Hamish Allan, from estate agency Winkworth, said: 'We had lots of interest from a broad range of potential buyers. 'There were first-time buyers, enquiries from people who wanted an extra or spare room and someone else who looked at buying it and putting it on AirBNB. 'It was only on for three weeks and we had a number of offers. The home is unique, there is no other way to describe it. 'It used to be a flower shop until the conversion. It is a really cleverly designed home and there is another bed which comes out but we can't call it a two-bed home. 'The typical properties we sell range between 1,400sq.ft and 2,200sq.ft and we have sold another one-bed which was 600sq.ft. 'But we've never sold anything this small. It has been a pleasure.' The house's buyers will be forced to walk across the kitchen worktop before climbing up several steps to make it into the 'bedroom' Hamish Allan, from  Winkworth, said: 'The home is unique, there is no other way to describe it. We've never sold anything this small' The bathroom is the only separate room in the property, even though it is barely large enough to fit a lavatory and a shower . The property's new owners will be forced to walk across the kitchen worktop before balancing on narrow steps, to make it to the 7ft 7ins x 5ft 8ins airborne 'bedroom'. The raised living area, complete with cushions and a small table, also has a small amount of storage space. The house is on the highly sought-after Richmond Avenue, one street away from Tony Blair's former house on Richmond Crescent. Blair sold that house for £615,000 in 1997 but it is now worth more than £3million. The new owners will now brush shoulders with Hi-de-Hi! actress Su Pollard, who lives on the same street. While Winkworth wouldn't confirm the exact agreed sale price or the buyers, the property had been put on the market for £275,000 - £100,000 more than the average price people paid for a home in England and Wales last month, according to the Land Registry. The Office of National Statistics said the average current value of a home in the UK is £275,000. Lawrence Hall, from Zoopla, said the tiny home has been one of the most viewed houses on the property website this year. He said: 'As a nation we have an obsession with property, but when it comes to the biggest, smallest, most expensive or cheapest properties we really see these being shared in huge volumes. 'We saw similar figures when the couple from Gogglebox put their 8 bedroom mansion on the market earlier this year.' The raised living area, complete with cushions and a small table, also has a small amount of storage space and a rather high ceiling . The property was put on the market for £275,000 - £100,000 more than the average price people pay for a home in England and Wales . Guinness World Records currently recognise a house in Conwy, north Wales, as Britain's smallest house. The house, aptly called The Smallest House in Great Britain, is just 10ft tall and has two rooms. It can only fit four people at a time and it around 6ft wide, but thousands of tourists still pay the £1 (50p for children) fee to enter the cramped, red house every year. It was occupied for about 200 years until local fisherman Robert Jones, who was 6ft 3ins tall, moved out in 1900. Local tour guide Anne Fletcher, 58, dons traditional Welsh dress to give visitors an authentic experience, and explained why the pint-sized home is a mecca for mini-home spotters the world over. She said: 'Thousands of people come to the Smallest House in Great Britain each year. That means we get hundreds of people every week during the height of summer.'","Britain's smallest property is one fifth of the size of the average new build and measures just 188 square feet .

"A Canadian teenager is giving impersonators a run for their money with his pitch-perfect rendition of the King's Blue Christmas. Armed with his guitar like a young Presley, David Thibault, 16, sings the classic song to gobsmacked radio station staff at CKOI Quebec. Close your eyes and the French-Canadian singer's voice is uncannily similar to the King of rock and roll. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The King lives: David Thibault performed Blue Christmas on a radio show which shocked presenters . He even has the same mannerisms and iconic black quiff. Blue Christmas was written by Billy Hayes and Jay W Johnson and is a tale of unrequited love during the holidays. The song was first recorded by Doye O'Dell in 1948 but Elvis made it his own in 1957 for his LP Elvis' Christmas Album which secured the song as a Christmas classic. In 1999 Low covered the song on their album Christmas. Even before Elvis died, there were 185 Elvis impersonators worldwide. Thirty six years on there are more than 200,000 and the numbers are rising. As the Reverend Steve Caprice - winner of Best Gospel Award 2007 - put it: 'If things carry on like this, by 2020, one in four people will be an Elvis Tribute Artist.'

A two-time winner in the US and with victories on the Asian, Japan and OneAsia Tours, Bae made his PGA Tour debut in 2012 and was granted US residency two years ago. The 28-year-old had sought legal advice after South Korea's Military Manpower Administration (MMA) rejected his request for an extension to his overseas travel permit.

"Queensland Reds utility Karmichael Hunt will not be selected for Friday's Super Rugby match against New Zealand's Otago Highlanders as he awaits a court appearance to answer charges of supplying cocaine, Reds CEO Jim Carmichael said on Monday. The 28-year-old, a potential Wallabies bolter for the World Cup, was stood down by the Reds last week after it emerged he was one of four people given notice by Queensland's Crime and Corruption Commission to appear in court on March 5. Hunt missed the Reds' win over Western Force over the weekend and will continue to stay on the sidelines pending his hearing, Carmichael revealed in a statement. Karmichael Hunt, pictured getting tackled, will miss Friday's Super Rugby match against Highlanders . The Queensland Reds ace is to appear in court to answer charges of supplying cocaine . 'Following extensive consultation with Karmichael over the weekend, we have determined that it continues to be best for Karmichael's welfare that he is not available for selection this Friday,' he said. 'As this highly complicated matter is due before the courts and is part of a wider and ongoing investigation by the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission, we will continue not to prejudice the player's legal or contractual rights and we will apply the principles of natural justice.' Reds coach Richard Graham said later on Monday that he supported Hunt though the player would not train with the rest of the team while under the legal cloud. 'We'll certainly keep him on a modified programme but that's more to do with his strength and conditioning, and keeping him ticking over,' he told reporters. One of the best-known athletes in the country after his previous careers as a rugby league international and in the indigenous football code Australian Rules, Hunt has played just one Super Rugby match since joining the Reds at the start of this year. Hunt has played just one Super Rugby match since joining the Reds at the start of this year . A QCCC statement released on Friday alleged the four people summoned to court 'arranged for the supply of cocaine for personal use or to on-supply cocaine to friends and colleagues between June and December 2014'. Hunt was on the roster of Aussie Rules club Gold Coast Suns last year. The Queensland Rugby Union claimed the alleged offences had actually occurred between September 1 and October 3, 2014 - before he started training with the Reds in late November. Carmichael said the QRU had a duty of care to Hunt, meaning the player may be allowed to continue playing with the Reds regardless of the outcome.

"Just five years ago Thakeham Manor's 16 acres were nothing but neglected industrial land. And then entrepreneur Jon Robinson came along and snapped up the site for £750,000 from the landowner who was going bust. It was clearly a sound investment, as Thakeham Manor, with its pool, trout lake, tennis courts, golfing green, triple garage – and a helipad on the lawn – is now on the market for the princely sum of £6 million. Seven years ago, at the grand old age of 31, Jon had retired to a villa in Cannes with his pregnant wife Victoriya, after selling his aviation spare parts company for several million pounds. Scroll down for video . Thakeham Manor has been designed to maximise stunning views over both the North and South Downs, and the influence of the family's time in Cannes is in evidence in the balustrades and palm trees on the terrace . However, after six months of enjoying a champagne lifestyle on private jets and yachts around the South of France, boredom began to set in. 'I went to Cannes to retire and relax and it was a lovely lifestyle but I couldn't just switch off my entrepreneurial brain,' says Jon. From his sunlounger, Jon spotted a gap in the market for providing luxury corporate holiday villas for wealthy City bankers, and before long he was brokering deals of tens of thousands of pounds by the side of the swimming pool. Mr Robinson  with his wife Victoria and children Alexander and Francesca at  West Sussex mansion . 'We had a constant stream of bookings from directors waving around the company Amex card who wouldn't think twice about spending £30,000 on a week's holiday let,' he says. 'But when the banking crash happened in 2008, bookings dried up.' Jon sold the villa in Cannes (which he'd bought for a seven-figure sum) to a wealthy Russian, and returned to Britain. Restless as ever, he set up a construction company, but found that because of the recession, business was slow. So he set the team to work on his own house in West Sussex. Price: £6 million . Location: Near Pulborough, West Sussex . Bedrooms: Five . Unique features: Helipad, swimming pool, trout lake, tennis courts, golf green, triple garage, nightclub-style reception area, iPhone-controlled electrics. 'My builders were all genuine people who I could have a real conversation with – none of the corporate falseness. Because they were great guys, I wanted to keep them busy.' Jon spent £500,000 pulling down the old industrial units and a further £3.5 million on building the house, which is approached through electric gates along a snaking gravel drive. The couple worked with an architect to create a five-bedroom home that ticked all the boxes required under their planning permission, while reflecting their own unique style. As a condition of giving consent for such a large house, the council insisted the build must have architectural merit – so the couple built it in the traditional style of famous British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. Glitzy: The home's reception area is styled on a nightclub - and it even boasts its own bar . The helipad on the lawn has seen regular use as the couple often charter a helicopter to take them to Ascot, Epsom and Goodwood. 'It's a great way to get in to London – I can be at a meeting in town in 12 minutes,' says Jon. The house has been designed to maximise stunning views over both the North and South Downs, and the influence of the family's time in Cannes is in evidence in the balustrades and palm trees on the terrace. 'This house is ridiculously 'high spec' because we built it for ourselves. It reflects our personalities. My wife and I created it from the drawing board,' says Jon . Inside, the 'nightclub-style' open plan reception area leads down to a sunken living space with vaulted ceiling. It has lasers, mood lighting, smoke machines, a dancing pole and a white leather and cubic zirconia bar, modelled on that found in the Fifth Floor Bar of London department store Harvey Nichols. 'This house is ridiculously 'high spec' because we built it for ourselves. It reflects our personalities. My wife and I created it from the drawing board,' says Jon. Sir Edwin  Lutyens designed the Grade I listed Cenotaph that stands in Whitehall, London. It was erected in 1919 for the Allied Victory Parade . Built for Queen Mary by Sir Edwin  between 1921 and 1924, the dolls house is a perfect replica in miniature of an aristocratic home . From life below stairs to the high-society setting of the saloon and dining room, no detail was forgotten . The enormous bespoke kitchen is his favourite room in the house, with its huge granite kitchen island. 'We had it shipped from Rio in one complete piece,' he says. Other extravagances include mature olive trees imported from Tuscany and gold-leaf tiles in the bathrooms. Everything in the house can be controlled by iPhone, including the music, temperature and CCTV. Jon and Victoriya now have two children together, Alexander, seven, and Francesca, five. Jon, who recently set up another aviation company, this time supplying parts to the defence industry, also has a 13-year-old son, William, from a previous relationship. The family are now on the move again. They have just bought a €2.85 million house in Sardinia and a £2 million yacht and plan to buy a smaller house as a West Sussex base once they've sold Thakeham Manor. Knebworth House was the family seat of Lutyen's wife and he made many alterations including building a dower house on the estate .

He designed the Grade I listed Cenotaph that stands in Whitehall, London. It was erected in 1919 for the Allied Victory Parade and was intended to commemorate  the victims of the First World War. But it is now used to remember all of the dead in all wars in which British servicemen and women have fought. He is known for having an instrumental role in designing and building a section of the metropolis of Delhi, known as New Delhi. In collaboration with Sir Herbert Baker, he was also the main architect of several monuments including the India Gate in Delhi. He also designed Viceroy's House, which is now known as the Rashtrapati Bhavan. It is regarded as his most important building and combined aspects of classical architecture with Indian decoration. In 1924 he completed the supervision of the construction of what is perhaps his most popular design: Queen Mary's Dolls' House. This four-storey Palladian villa was built in 1/12 scale and is now a permanent exhibit in the public area of Windsor Castle. He married Emily Lytton, daughter of a Viceroy of India, in 1897. After World War I Lutyens became architect to the Imperial War Graves Commission, for which he designed the Cenotaph, the Great War Stone and military cemeteries in France. His vast project for the Roman Catholic cathedral at Liverpool was incomplete at his death. He also designed the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme, which remembers 72,195 British and South African men who died in the Battles of the Somme.

"A terrified man who feared he had contracted Ebola after returning from an Africa trip last night told how an NHS call centre advised him to drive himself to hospital. Adam Griffiths, 24, of Swansea, stunned medical teams when he turned up at the hospital with concerns he had contracted Ebola. He was then immediately placed in a decontamination room 'used for terrorist attacks'. When met by doctors in full protective body suits, he said they were 'shocked' at the advice he was given by the NHS call centre. Mr Griffiths, who works as a salesman, was staying in Bristol after arriving back in the UK from travelling around Africa.

Adam, of Swansea, South Wales, was staying in Bristol where his girlfriend lives after he began feeling ill on his return from travelling in Africa and Egypt. Fearing he was suffering the symptoms of Ebola, he went to hospital in Bristol and was later transferred to a specialist infectious disease control suite. Adam said: 'Just a few days ago I became really ill, having chest pains, being hot and sweaty with blood blisters on my hands and abdominal pains. 'I was staying at my girlfriend's house in Bristol and on Friday night my conditions started to get worse, I rang NHS England 111. I told them what was wrong and my symptoms and also that I had recently come back from Africa. Mr Griffiths was staying in Bristol with his girlfriend when he started feeling ill after his return from Africa . Southmead Hospital in Bristol, where Mr Griffiths drove himself fearing he had contracted Ebola . 'I was told they would send an ambulance or I could travel myself to either of the hospitals in Bristol. 'Many hours later after blood tests were taken and specialists in London had been spoken to it was confirmed I did not have hemorrhagic fever also known as Ebola. 'However, I may still have malaria. I later discharged myself from hospital.' A spokesman for North Bristol NHS Trust confirmed the incident happened but refuted Mr Griffiths' claim that 'staff panicked'. He said: 'We acted appropriately and are glad Mr Griffiths had a good outcome.' Dr Chris Burton, medical director of North Bristol NHS Trust, said: 'We can confirm that a patient was admitted to our Emergency Department with possible viral haemorrhagic fever. 'He was fully and appropriately tested, following nationally agreed guidelines, and was found not to have the Ebola virus. 'On arrival he was quickly and efficiently assessed by staff who followed the correct procedures and protocols to ensure there was no risk to any other patient or member of staff. 'We are satisfied that our staff acted professionally and appropriately throughout this process and are pleased that the patient had a good outcome. 'North Bristol NHS Trust has been following national guidance around Ebola and making plans in line with Public Health England and Department of Health advice. 'Contingency plans are in place and have been walked through with relevant staff. If and when guidance changes we will respond accordingly. A health worker is sprayed down with disinfectant in Liberia, where the virus has killed more than 2,000 people . The body of a person killed by Ebola is removed from a house in Monrovia, Liberia . 'We have the internal decontamination room in the emergency department set up for anybody who comes in through A&E suspected of having Ebola. 'Staff in the emergency department, pathology and the medical microbiology team have received training in how to respond if an Ebola case is suspected. 'A room has been prepared in case a patient comes in with suspected Ebola where staff have protective clothing and equipment and will follow an agreed process. 'If a patient tests positive for Ebola the trust will contact the Royal Free and take advice from them. At this point the expectation is that the patient would then be transferred to the Royal Free in London.'","NHS 111 call centre told him to drive to hospital with Ebola symptoms .

"Three Labour figures have accused Tony Blair’s government of turning a blind eye to child abuse and terrorism in the Muslim community – for fear of inflaming community tensions. Former MP Ann Cryer said the ‘politically correct brigade’ predominant on the left dismissed her warnings after she exposed a sex-abuse scandal involving Asian men in her constituency. Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said far too many on the left had been guilty of ‘obsessing about multiculturalism’ rather than more important issues such as child rape. Demanding answers: Simon Danczuk (left) and Denis MacShane blast Labour for 'turning a blind eye to abuse' And Denis MacShane, a former Foreign Office minister and MP for Rotherham, said he was threatened with the sack by Jack Straw for urging Muslims to turn away from terrorism. The sustained criticism of the Blair government’s record came as it emerged that MPs will launch an investigation into whether the Home Office knew about allegations of abuse in Rotherham as far back as 2001. At least 1,400 girls as young as 11 were assaulted and raped by gangs of Asian men over a period of 16 years. Some had guns pointed at them or were doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight. The Commons home affairs committee will question Home Secretary Theresa May over what her department knew about what had gone on in Rotherham. It is now known that in 2002, a Home Office researcher was conducting an investigation into trafficking and underage prostitution by mainly Muslim gangs in Rotherham, but it was never published. Home Secretary at the time was Labour’s David Blunkett, and there is no suggestion that he knew of the report’s existence. But the committee of MPs will ask whether there was an overriding culture in the Blair government aimed at avoiding any harm to community cohesion. Keith Vaz, chairman of the committee, said: ‘We would be very keen to get from the Home Office a full and frank response to the research that was commissioned in 2002. ‘This is an essential part of the jigsaw to determine why the council failed to act, and whether the Home Office could have done more to ensure that it did act. ‘We want to see every piece of information the Home Office holds on this, and I will be writing to the Home Secretary to ask that the databases are searched to see what files it holds on this horrific behaviour in Rotherham.’ Former Labour MP Ms Cryer said that when she raised similar issues in her constituency of Keighley between 2002 and 2004, her views were dismissed. ‘A politically correct left just saw it as racism,’ she said. The MP was shunned by elements of her party and a panic button was installed in her house. Under fire: Tony Blair's administration is accused of putting social cohesion above investigations into abuse . Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World This Weekend programme, she said: ‘The politically correct brigade will always have anxieties about this sort of thing. ‘You don’t want to give the BNP and the EDL ammunition, but I had to think if these were my daughters I’d be very upset about this, so what can I do to alleviate the situation.’ Ms Cryer revealed that former London mayor Ken Livingstone suggested she had ‘misunderstood’ the situation in Keighley. ‘Frustrated is an understatement. I was very cross.’ The former MP called for mandatory reporting so that doctors, teachers and social workers are obliged to flag up suspected abuse. ‘Schools and hospitals have to pay a more active part in these things,’ she said. Mr Danczuk, who has done much to expose abuse carried out by Asian men in his constituency of Rochdale, said that some of his Labour colleagues disapproved of his efforts. ‘Last week I received a text message from a current Labour MP saying she was disappointed by my views on this issue,’ he wrote. ‘I was only elected in 2010 and already I’ve found that politicians are sometimes discouraged from exploring and investigating complex issues because they’re expected to stay tethered to a dominant ideology and not stray far from the stock replies to difficult questions. ‘I’m in no doubt that Rotherham is not an isolated case, and the same kind of abuse is happening right now in towns and cities across the country. ‘If we’re going to save a lost generation from having childhood innocence ripped from them, then we need to stop obsessing about multiculturalism and reform children’s services now.’ Mr Danczuk said that in too many councils, ‘management exists in a bubble’ and espouse views ‘where political correctness and cultural sensitivity are more important than child rape’. ‘Managers become more interested in ticking boxes in diversity training than protecting children,’ he said. ‘This is dogma for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Common sense is not on the menu.’ Last week former Foreign Office minister Denis MacShane admitted he did not do enough to speak up about child abuse in his Rotherham seat because he was ‘a Guardian-reading liberal Leftie’ who did not want to ‘rock the multicultural community boat’. But yesterday the MP, who stepped down two years ago after being found guilty of expenses fraud, revealed he had criticised Muslims who supported terrorism – and was threatened with the sack by the then Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw. He had called on Muslims in the UK to choose between the ‘British way or the way of the terrorists’ after a 24-year-old from South Yorkshire tried to bomb Israelis in a Tel Aviv bar in 2003. The former minister said he was forced to agree to a ‘grovelling climb-down’ because he was warned his remarks could upset community relations. Mr MacShane had planned to say it was ‘time for the elected and community leaders of British Muslims to make a choice: the British way, based on political dialogue and non-violent protests, or the way of the terrorists against which the whole democratic world is uniting.’ ‘Jack Straw spent an inordinate amount of time cossetting his Muslim constituents in Blackburn,’ he said. ‘He had brought in an official from the Muslim Council of Britain to advise the FCO on outreach to Islamist outfits like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. ‘To attack their values was heresy. I was told I was close to being fired as a minister unless I signed some grovelling climb-down which, as a coward, I did.’","Ann Cryer, Simon Danczuk and Denis MacShane launch attack on Tony Blair .

"BBC chiefs Lord Hall and Lord Patten will be grilled by MPs this week over an alleged ‘cover-up’ in the £3million inquiry into the Corporation’s failure to expose the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Mail on Sunday understands the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee will call up Lord Hall, the BBC’s director-general since April, and Lord Patten, BBC Trust chairman, on Tuesday. They will be asked about their refusal to investigate why key evidence about ex-BBC director-general Mark Thompson was excluded from the Pollard Review – the report into Newsnight’s axed expose of the disgraced DJ. Lord Hall pictured on his first day as director-general at BBC headquarters in London . Trust Chairman Lord Patten will also face politicians' questions about an alleged 'cover-up' of the Jimmy Savile scandal . Last night, a Culture Committee source said it was ‘a certainty’ Hall and Patten would be tackled about the matter, while an MP said the BBC’s failure to act ‘smelt like a cover-up’ and the report needed to be changed. Helen Boaden, the BBC’s former head of news and now the £340,000 head of BBC radio, told the review that she had told Thompson that Savile had been accused of sexually abusing girls at a Surrey school, in a phone call in November 2011. Thompson – now chief executive of The New York Times on a £3.7million salary – maintains he was not told about the sexual abuse allegations until October 2012. Boaden’s evidence was excluded from the Pollard report when it was published, an omission a source close to the review – named after Nick Pollard, the ex-Sky News executive who chaired the inquiry – has admitted was  a ‘mistake’. The BBC chiefs will be asked about their refusal to investigate why key evidence was excluded from the Pollard Review . If Boaden’s story is accurate, Thompson will stand accused of bringing the BBC into disrepute by allowing it to screen tribute programmes to Savile after he died on October 29, 2011 – despite knowing about the allegations against him. Lord Patten was made aware of the issue in a letter from Tory MP Rob Wilson on September 6 and shared the information with Lord Hall and Pollard. When Lord Patten advised Mr Wilson to speak to Pollard personally, Mr Wilson claimed Patten and the BBC were effectively ‘kicking the issue into the long grass’. Last night, Mr Wilson said the report must be corrected to reflect the evidence. He said: ‘Lord Patten and Tony Hall have seen the evidence but are content to try and kick it into the long grass. This is starting to smell like a cover-up by the BBC.’ A BBC spokesman said the Pollard inquiry found that BBC management did not suppress reports on Newsnight about Savile as had been widely alleged. ‘We accepted his findings. We have seen nothing that would in any way affect that,’ he said. A BBC Trust spokesman rejected the suggestion the chairman washed his hands of this matter. He said: ‘We have made clear to Rob Wilson MP that he should discuss his concerns directly with Nick Pollard, as a first step. That was the sensible and obvious thing to do.’ A Pollard Review spokesman said it ‘stood by the conclusions of its report’.","Lord Hall and Lord Patten will face MPs' questions this week .

"A mother facing charges after three dead babies were found stashed in her squalid home has told cops one of the children was born alive and lived for several days before she found it dead. Erika Murray claims she put the baby down for a nap in a bassinet in her Blackstone, Massachusetts home but when she returned an hour later, the child was dead, her lawyer told the Boston Herald. The baby had a 'fairly full head of hair' when investigators found its remains in a backpack in her home during a search in August, prosecutors told a court on Tuesday. Along with another dead child found inside a closet, the baby was found dressed in a diaper and onesie, leading investigators to believe they had been born alive. Accused: Erika Murray, pictured in court last week, told cops that one of the children found dead in her home had lived for several days before she found it dead. The remains of two other babies were also found . A third dead baby had an umbilical cord and the remains of a placenta still attached to its body. The remains of the three infants were found in Murray's older children's bedroom closets when authorities executed search warrants after neighbors raised the alarm in August. The medical examiner's office is working to determine the babies' causes of death. A spokesman for the district attorney's office refused to comment about the latest claims made by Murray's lawyer, saying: 'Anything we say about this case we'll say in open court.' Murray, 31, is being held on $1 million bail on charges including fetal death concealment. Scene: The three babies were found in closets in the bedrooms of Murray's older children. Police had searched the home after a neighbor alerted authorities when one of the older children asked her for help . Her four children, ranging in age from five months to 13 years, were rescued from her filthy home on August 28 after her 10-year-old son went to a neighbor's home asking for help to quieten the crying five-month-old baby. The neighbor found the youngest child covered in feces. Neither the baby nor Murray's three-year-old child have birth records and both are severely malnourished. authorities said. The infant is extremely sensitive to sunlight and the three-year-old cannot walk, has poor muscle tone and only makes a few sounds. In court on Tuesday, prosecutors said the three-year-old's muscle tone suggested that she had spent most of her young life on her back. Blackstone code enforcement officer Bill Walsh said when he walked inside the smell was overwhelming, and that the second floor looked like a landfill. He recalled rooms covered in feces, maggots and hundreds of dirty diapers. Squalid: Investigators said the family's home was covered in soiled diapers, maggots and feces . Shocking: They said that the stench inside the home, where four children lived, was overwhelming . Murray arrived at the house and agreed the children should not live in the home, but did not seem to be upset they would be removed from her care, authorities said. After interviewing the older children, police got a search warrant and went back to the house, where they found the skeletal remains of one baby with a full head of hair in a backpack in the closet of an upstairs bedroom. After discovering those remains, police obtained another search warrant. During the second search, they found the remains of two other babies in another bedroom, also inside a closet. When questioned by police in August, Murray admitted that the two youngest children were hers, and said that her live-in-boyfriend, Raymond Rivera, was their father. She had previously told her two eldest children, aged 10 and 13, to tell teir father that she was simply baby-sitting the two younger children, prosecutors said. Arrest: Murray's boyfriend Ramon Rivera III is pictured in court on Tuesday. He faces drug charges for allegedly growing marijuana in the basement of the house where they lived in Blackstone, Massachusetts . Rivera, has not been charged in connection with the discovery of the infants' remains, but faces drug charges for allegedly growing marijuana in the home's basement. Prosecutors also said that the charges against Murray could be upgraded once a grand jury investigation concludes. The Blackstone Board of Health condemned the house where Murray, Rivera and the children lived and are planning to demolish it later this month. The two older children are staying with a paternal grandparent, while the two younger ones are receiving medical attention under foster care.","Erika Murray is in jail on $1 million bond after the remains of three babies were found inside her filthy, vermin-filled Massachusetts home .

"Up to a million people living near Heathrow suffer from aircraft noise – more than four times official estimates, research shows. The study says residents become ‘annoyed’ by aircraft noise at a much lower level than has previously been claimed, and that policies are being based on ‘out-of-date’ information. The Airports Commission is currently considering a proposal to add a third runway at Heathrow, using a benchmark of 57 decibels as the level at which communities suffer ‘significant annoyance’. A new study has revealed that residents become 'annoyed' by aircraft noise at a lower level than was previously thought. The research has shown that up to one million people living near Heathrow suffer aircraft noise . London Mayor Boris Johnson, pictured at a protest calling for no third runway at Heathrow, said expanding the airport would be 'indefensible' in light of the new evidence. The Airports Commission is considering where a new runway should be built to serve London . But last night London Mayor Boris Johnson said the new evidence on noise meant expanding Heathrow was indefensible. The report, conducted by acoustician Dr Ian Flindell from the University of Southampton, says communities start to become irritated by noise as low as 50 decibels – which would mean that around 750,000 additional people are being adversely affected. It goes on to say that using old data would ‘considerably underestimate the extent of reported community annoyance around UK airports’. An Airports Commission spokesman said: ‘A noise assessment will  be needed to take forward the appraisal of proposals to improve airport capacity. ‘We are currently consulting on the framework for the assessment and will consider this contribution.","New study says residents become 'annoyed' by aircraft noise at a much lower level than has been previously claimed .

"Former pupils at one of the country’s leading prep schools have come forward to say they were physically and sexually abused by at least two teachers, writes Paul Cahalan. Ashdown House, in East Sussex, boasts such prominent alumni as Boris Johnson and Homeland actor Damian Lewis. It is understood neither Johnson nor Lewis is among those claiming they were abused, but both attended the school between 1970 and 1980, the period in which the abuse is alleged to have occurred. Boris Johnson attended Ashdown School in Sussex, which is currently at the centre of abuse allegations . One alleged victim, speaking on condition of anonymity,  said: ‘One of the teachers abused and beat pupils, it was extremely violent. But my story is nothing compared to those of some of the others.’ The Mail on Sunday understands that police are  not yet investigating and details of the allegations have not yet been released. But a lawyer acting for the former pupils said that the alleged abuse was ‘serious and widespread’. A spokesman for Ashdown House, which today teaches about 140 boys and girls aged five to 13, said last night the school had not been made aware of the claims. The news comes after revelations of abuse at some  of the country’s top private schools, including Caldicott Prep School in Buckinghamshire, attended by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Pupils have come forward to say they were physically and sexually abused at Ashdown House school, which was attended by Homeland star Damian Lewis . There have also been allegations of abuse at the Choristers School in Durham and the Yehudi Menuhin  School in Surrey. Last week, Mr Clegg said he was ‘shocked and appalled’ to hear the former head teacher of Caldicott had been convicted of historic child sex offences. Roland Peter Wright, 83,  head teacher between 1959 and 1970, was convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault against five pupils aged eight to 13. It is understood the former pupils at Ashdown, which charges £7,990 per term for borders, want to sue the school and the members of staff in question, as well as pressing criminal charges. Liz Dux, of legal firm Slater and Gordon, said: ‘We are in the very early stages of a highly complex and sensitive case.’","Former pupils have come forward to make the allegations .

"Taking action: Energy minister Greg Barker wants energy companies to pay . Energy companies are to be summoned to Downing Street and ordered to return millions of pounds to customers who have overpaid bills through direct debits. Ministers will react to growing public outrage over inflation-busting charges by telling the power giants to stop stockpiling more than £2 billion from households. The companies will be told that if they don’t return the money – or pay back the estimated £36 million a year that the cash pile earns in interest – they will face fines. Energy Minister Greg Barker said consumers would be ‘outraged’ that  companies such as British Gas and EDF boost their revenues by holding on to customers’ cash. Mr Barker said: ‘Customers will rightly feel outraged that they signed up to direct debit payments for cheap tariffs but instead find their cash stockpiled. ‘We need to stamp this out now and energy firms must come clean on how much cash they are sitting on. If we find serious abuse, rest assured we will come down on them like a ton of bricks.’ He is expected to point to smaller energy firms – such as Ovo Energy, which offers an annual rate of up to three per cent on credits – and tell the ‘big-six’ companies that they should do likewise. The companies will also be asked to sign up to a code of practice, which will impose strict conditions on the use of customers’ surplus cash. A senior Whitehall source said: ‘We are becoming increasingly concerned about the problem. If the energy companies are unable to resolve the issue, the regulator, Ofgem, will be asked to investigate and potentially impose fines.’ The average annual dual energy bill is now nearly £1,500 – with figures from Ofgem showing that, since 2001, gas bills have risen by 137 per cent and electricity by 66 per cent. Ofgem . has confirmed that millions of customers who switched to a direct debit . payment system to secure a cheaper tariff have been overcharged. And . the consumer group Which? says the energy giants enjoy a £1.2 billion . ‘surplus’ each year from customers who are in credit – which they are . then free to invest for an annual return of up to three per cent. Industry experts believe the figure is now closer to £2 billion, as the research was based on 2012 data. Mark . Todd, of switching site energyhelpline, said: ‘We think that about 20 . million households are now on direct debit and from our experience the . average credit is conservatively about £100 on each bill. Energy Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'This is about big businesses profiteering' ‘That’s £2 billion being held. We think it is scandalous and Ofgem should do something about it.’ As . a condition of the Gas and Electricity Supply Licence, credits must be . refunded if asked for by the customer – but only 13 per cent of . consumers had made the request. Mr . Barker added: ‘Ofgem has already acted to tighten up abuse of direct . debits – but we will be holding very frank discussions with the  big-six . to make sure all consumers get a fair deal.’ Energy . Secretary Michael Fallon added: ‘This is about big businesses . profiteering. We have ordered Ofgem to ensure direct debits are accurate . and are refunded. Ofgem needs to get tougher. Companies are banking . with consumers’ money and customers are being taken for a ride.’ An . Ofgem spokesman said: ‘If any customers are concerned about direct . debit payments they should complain to their supplier – and if the . complaint is not resolved they can ask the independent Energy Ombudsman . to examine it for them.’ An npower spokesman said: ‘We automatically refund any customer with over £60 credit at this time.’ A . Scottish Power spokesman said: ‘Scottish Power will pay a customer £1 . for every full multiple of £33 above a minimum credit value of £100 – to . the maximum pay-out of £12 for a credit balance of £496.’ An . SSE spokesman said: ‘If customers are more than £100 in credit, we . automatically refund the credit back to their bank account.” A . British Gas spokesman said: ‘The amount of time customers are in debit . far outweighs the amount of time customers are in credit.’ An EDF spokesman said: ‘Monthly direct debits are the cheapest way for people to pay their bills.’ E.ON did not respond to requests for information.","Greg Barker say energy firms must come clean on overpaid direct debits .

"British taxpayers are funding waste collections in communist Cuba, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The EU has given £1.6 million to fund bin rounds on the Caribbean island as part of an environmental regeneration project – at a time when many UK collections are being cut. Although the EU’s trade embargo against the communist regime ended in 2008, the Foreign Office still regards Cuba as a ‘country of concern’ because of its appalling human rights record. Funded: The EU has given £1.6 million to fund bin rounds to regenerate the Caribbean island of Cuba . Last night, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the project revealed the ‘breathtaking hypocrisy’ of Brussels bureaucrats. The scheme, called Recycle For A Better Life, aims to increase ‘collection of municipal solid waste for households and non-residential in the Caribbean islands of Cuba and Dominican Republic’ as well as ‘making new generations aware about the environment’. It is co-funded by the European Commission, part of the EU responsible for providing aid through programmes around the world. The recycling project – agreed in April – is based around the historical centres of Havana and Santo Domingo, with cash funnelled through EuropeAid, part of the European Commission’. In Havana, ‘non-domestic users’ such as hotels, restaurants and offices, are required to separate their rubbish into paper, plastic, aluminium and tinplate, the project’s website states. The collections will also ‘be extended to home users’. EU cash – including UK contributions – paid for 75 per cent of the three-year scheme, which is part of the €86 million (£68.7 million) in international development funding Brussels has given to Cuba since 2008. 'Breathtaking hypocrisy': The project comes as the UK faces dramatic cuts to waste collections . A European Commission spokesman confirmed the EU was contributing €2 million (£1.6 million) to projects in Cuba and Dominican Republic. ‘Waste production is a continually increasing problem, especially in developing countries,’ she added. ‘Helping our partner countries get a proper waste management system is the main idea behind this project.’ But Mr Pickles said: ‘This is an example of breathtaking hypocrisy by the Eurocrats, wasting taxpayers’ cash on supporting extensive bin collections in communist Cuba while at the same time bullying councils into axeing weekly collections in Britain. 'In contrast, this Government is working to improve the quality and frequency of recycling and rubbish collections, and supporting weekly collections. ‘The EU bin bureaucrats should be held to account for this appalling waste of taxpayers’ money.’","The EU has given £1.6m to fund waste collections on Caribbean island .

"The family of Misty Upham have said they were forced to set up their own search party when the Django Unchained actress went missing after police 'did not help the investigation'. Relatives, who have gathered together in Auburn, Washington, to grieve also believe the 32-year-old could have been found alive if police had 'taken their concerns seriously'. It follows claims from her August: Osage County co-star Juliette Lewis that the 32-year-old Native American told her she 'feared she was being targeted' while others believe her death was as a result of 'foul play'. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The dead body of Misty Upham, 32, who was missing since October 5, was found on Thursday . Frustration: Her family (Charles her father pictured left) claim they had to set up their own search party because the police 'did not help the investigation' Despair: Her father posted on Facebook saying that law enforcement was not looking for his daughter . A spokesman for the family released a statement on Friday evening saying: 'The family wants to make it clear the Auburn police did not help in the investigation or the finding of Misty at all. It was her uncle, Roberth Upham, who organized the search party that found Misty. 'The family is concerned that if the police had actually taken their concerns seriously within those first few hours of the report that perhaps she would have been found.' 'We are now just waiting on the coroner's report.' Asked if family and friends could trust the coroner's report, she responded: 'The family has concerns. We are waiting to hear what is stated in the coroner's report but there is a long history of police harassment between the Auburn police and the native community. 'There's a lot of distrust. And that's founded in the historical trauma experienced by the native community at the hands of the police. 'And you know, Misty has also experienced harassment at the hands of police so you know, the family is concerned about the circumstances surrounding what happened and why police chose not look for Misty.' Tribute: Juliette Lewis posted a picture on Instagram with Misty saying she fought for the voiceless fiercely . Calling for action: She warned Misty feared 'she could be murdered' and had suffered horrible violence . 'The family stated they do not feel she committed suicide. The family has stated that her death is most likely an accident. 'And they've also stated that they feel ais if their concerns weren't listed to, and when they pleaded for help this perhaps could have been prevented and her body could have been found in time after she fell.' Others close to the family of the Native American have said she could have been a victim of 'foul play'. A source, who would only call himself Harry, told Mail Online he believes the police in Auburn, Washington are 'derelict' in their duty after she went missing for 12 days. 'She had her purse with her and because she had her purse and phone the police thought she left of her own will,' he said. 'Her uncle found her, not police, and her purse was near the cliff where she fell to her death.' He added the family was certain she fell or else was the subject of 'foul play'. A spokesman for the Muckleshoot reservation did not immediately comment on Misty's death or allegations city police did not do enough to look for her. Upham, 32, a Native American actress praised for her roles in movies including August: Osage County, Frozen River and Django Unchained, was missing for 12 days before police found her body at the bottom of a wooded embankment in Auburn, Washington. Friends: The pair starred together in August: Osage County last year and remained firm friends afterwards . Officers have declared there is 'no evidence of foul play' as they continue to investigate the death. But today Juliette Lewis took to Twitter blasting the task force's announcement, warning: 'police must do an investigation'. She tweeted about her August: Osage County co-star: '#RIPMistyUpham I am in shock and greif [sic]. I pray the police do a murder investigation. They're saying not 'foul play' when ofcourse it is. 'Misty spoke out alot against injustices within Native community. And had known enemies. Police must do an investigation.' She then retweeted a series of Upham's own tweets, including a warning for people to 'walk on egg shells' because she had 'just been followed by Indian Trader'. Later, Lewis added: 'I cant sleep. Too much darkness. I feel so sad about Misty. I know she has more to say. And about how she died. 'Misty told me about horrible violence she suffered on NA reservations She felt she coul be murdered! Bcuz she was vocal #ThisIsNOTaSUICIDE '. Accolade: They are pictured sharing a moment here after receiving the Ensemble Cast Award for the movie . Upham's family has also blasted claims of a suicide, claiming she fell to her death. Close relatives of the 32-year-old star told TMZ she was in 'a reflective mood' when she went to the scenic wooded embankment where her body was found and accidentally fell off a cliff. Her shoes and purse were found at the top of the cliff. They insist she had been talking about moving back to LA. Upham had recently returned to the Seattle-area to help care for her father, Charles Upham, who suffered a stroke last year. Last night, it was Mr Upham who had to identify the lifeless body of his own daughter. Shortly after her disappearance, Upham told KIRO-FM that his daughter was upset and erratic and had stopped taking medication for anxiety and bipolar disorder. Auburn police had responded to a suicide call at Misty Upham's residence in the days before she was last seen, authorities said. Her father previously said he did not believe she was suicidal. Lewis reiterated his sentiment by posting a picture of herself and Misty on Instagram with the caption: 'Misty Upham survived many things that many don't early on in life. She fought for the voiceless feircely [sic]. 'She understood suffering and the deepest pain. She had a presence everyone saw and felt. It is this presence that will continue. 'Out of the dark space in which her light got dimmed. I will remember her as tuff [sic]. Wise. Funny. Spiritual. And hopeful. 'This is another great reminder to call and check on someone when you think to. Not when its too late. RIPMistyUpham' It took just over five hours to identify the body. The Hollywood Reporter spoke with Seattle-based filmmaker Tracy Rector who said that Misty Upham's uncle, Robert Upham, organized a search party to look for the missing actress three days ago. Missing: Upham's parents had been canvassing their town and hanging 'missing' posters for 12 days . 'We waited at the site where the team found the body,' Rector told The Hollywood Reporter. 'It took about five-and-a-half hours to confirm. Then we gathered around her body to say prayers and now we're all gathered at the church.' Mr Upham told the MailOnline late Wednesday that he was frantic to find his daughter and felt that media attention had focused on her glamorous days on the red carpet and not her as a 'normal person.' He said the actress, a member of the Blackfoot tribe, had cut off her long locks before she went missing. He denied his daughter would ever go through with a suicide. He told KIRO-FM that Misty was in a 'psychotic' state when she left her house with only the clothes on her back and without her medication. 'It wasn't like she just decided to take time off,' he said. He added: 'She has said suicidal things in the past but never followed through,' he said. 'She doesn't believe in killing herself. She believes that is a sin and she would never do that.' Speaking to HollywoodLife.com, Mona Upham, Misty's mother, accused the Seattle area police of not doing enough to find her daughter. She attributed it to her Native-American background. 'I think if Misty was different-looking they would be doing a lot more to help find her,' she said. This was not the first time Upham has reportedly left her home without notice, and it is also not the first time police have responded to suicide calls at her residence. People magazine reported that in the last year, police have responded to Upham's apartment four times following suicide calls. Upham may have been under a lot of stress prior to her death. Movies: Upham recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County' which starred Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. But she had won an award for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River' A source reportedly told People that Upham was struggling financially and sometimes had trouble paying her rent. Police received a suicide call on October 5, but when officers arrived, she was no longer at her father's house. A day later, her father went to the police asking that his daughter be listed as a 'missing and endangered person.' The police did not comply, saying that Upham's case did not meet the criteria because her disappearance was not 'unexplainable, involuntary or suspicious,' according to USA Today. Therefore, the Upham family took to Facebook and local media to alert the public about their missing daughter and to enlist the public's help in finding her. In a Facebook post on Upham's page, the family stated: 'We have been consumed by chasing down leads and doing ground searches in the area she was last seen. It is only her family searching right now, hanging posters, checking with shelters, hospitals, and asking people in the area if she has been seen. Upham is best known for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River,' for which she received an Independent Spirit Award nomination. She recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County.' Her next onscreen role will be in 'Cake' with Jennifer Aniston and Anna Kendrick.","Relatives say uncle Robert Upham organized search party .

"England's most senior doctor yesterday admitted she had taken cannabis. Professor Sally Davies also appeared to question the policy of treating drug abuse as a criminal offence. Dame Sally, the chief medical officer, said she had experimented with cannabis three or four times at university but stopped after suffering hallucinations. Professor Dame Sally Davies said all babies and young children should be given free vitamins on the NHS . She has previously claimed that criminalising drugs deterred addicts from seeking medical help. Dame Sally has also said she would be ‘ready with quite a lot of advice’ if ministers decided to decriminalise some drugs. Mental . health charities have warned that any move to liberalise Britain’s . drugs laws could increase the use of cannabis, which has been widely . linked to psychological problems. Dame Sally, 63, recently named as the sixth most powerful woman in Britain, revealed she had tried cannabis baked into cookies while studying medicine at Manchester University in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Government’s most senior medical adviser said: ‘I never smoked, so I couldn’t smoke joints, but I did have some cookies until on the third or fourth occasion I had hallucinations and I have never touched it since. ‘I think I understood through that what my father said to me when I told him I was going to try it. He said drugs de-civilise you, you stop being a civilised person.’ Dame Sally said she tried cannabis baked into cookies while she was studying at university . Dame Sally, who was appointed as . England’s chief medical officer in 2010, has always stopped short of . supporting the decriminalisation of any illegal drugs. But she has repeatedly questioned whether . the Government’s policy on drug use should be driven by the Home . Office, with its inevitable focus on law and order, or by the Department . of Health. Interviewed on BBC Radio 3’s Private . Passions yesterday, she said: ‘Of course it’s a medical problem, . addiction is a medical problem and it becomes a public health problem . and then our society is choosing to treat that as a criminal justice . issue.’ Giving evidence to MPs on the science and technology select . committee in January, she said: ‘I think we have a health problem and we . would do well as a nation to look at it as a health problem. ‘I think there’s quite a lot of evidence from other countries, and science, about how you could go about that.’ Her . comments drew criticism from anti-drugs campaigners. Peter Stoker, of . the National Drug Prevention Alliance, said: ‘When people say they want . it treated as a health matter what they really mean is they want it . decriminalised. ‘There are health implications to using cannabis but there are also social and legal problems.’ Dame Sally said addiction to drugs should be treated as a medical issue (file picture) Mary . Brett, of charity Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘Lots of people try it at . university but it would have been helpful if she could have said that . cannabis now is much stronger and more dangerous than when she tried it. ‘She is the chief medical officer, she ought to have included some kind of warning to children not to try it.’ Dame Sally is England's first female chief medical officer . Around . two million people in Britain use cannabis, according to the Royal . College of Psychiatrists, and half of all 16 to 29-year-olds have tried . it at least once.  But recent research has suggested the drug can be . linked to psychotic illnesses. The Home Office has resisted numerous . calls for the radical liberalisation of Britain’s drug laws, including . from its own advisers. Professor David Nutt was sacked as chairman of . the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs after he criticised the . decision to upgrade cannabis to a Class B drug in 2009. Dame Sally . admitted her high-profile role, which has a salary of more than . £200,000, could be difficult when her personal beliefs did not match . policy. But in a wide-ranging interview, she also said she had . deliberately cut down on drinking wine since her appointment because of . official guidelines. She said: ‘I have never hidden the fact I enjoy . a glass of wine but I try not to be photographed now with one, and I do . drink less because I have read the evidence and I am persuaded of it .’ Dame . Sally, who lives with her third husband and their two daughters in . Islington, North London, was named as the sixth most powerful woman in . Britain by BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour in February.

"Caroline Nokes says she fears for her and her daughter’s safety . A Conservative MP has revealed how she has installed panic buttons in her house, changed her locks, and considers leaving Parliament ‘on a weekly basis’ because of vicious on-line trolling following a feud with pressure group Fathers 4 Justice. Caroline Nokes, MP for Romsey and Southampton North, says she fears for her and her daughter’s safety after being deluged for 18 months with emails and Facebook and Twitter messages sent by supporters of the fathers’ rights group, who have made life a ‘living hell’. They included a message from a female Facebook user who said she hoped the MP would be ‘violently raped ... and left for dead’. Miss Nokes said that she complained to police but has decided not to bring charges. Fathers 4 Justice deny any knowledge of the woman who sent this or other threatening messages. Miss Nokes added that the abuse so affected her family that her 16-year-old daughter asked her not to stand for re-election next year. The 42-year-old former charity chief executive, who was elected in 2010, said she was determined to continue as an MP rather than give in to ‘bullies’. She added: ‘I probably come close to quitting the job on a weekly basis because of what they say. The thing that keeps me going is, what sort of example does that set? ‘My daughter asked me not to stand in the General Election because she saw the effect it was having on me, but my view has always been: Don’t give in to bullies,’ Miss Nokes said. The abusive messages started after Miss Nokes became embroiled in a row with Matt O’Connor, the founder of Fathers 4 Justice, and his wife, over childcare policy. As The Mail on Sunday revealed last week, the increasingly bitter feud has culminated in the O’Connors accusing Miss Nokes and her friend, the former Tory lobbyist Adrian Yalland, of stalking and harassment, which they deny. Miss Nokes first met the O’Connors in 2010 but fell out with them after they claimed she reneged on promises made before the General Election on parenting policy and the Children and Families Bill, enacted in 2012. The abusive messages started after Miss Nokes became embroiled in a row with Matt O’Connor, the founder of Fathers 4 Justice, and his wife (above), over childcare policy. Miss Nokes, dubbed one of ‘Cameron’s cuties’ when she was elected, had an affair revealed the same year. She says the O’Connors seized upon her divorce, questioning Miss Nokes’s custody over her daughter, the access given to her ex-husband and naming her daughter on the Fathers 4 Justice website. ‘They wanted to humiliate me and to prove I had done a U-turn on the bill because I got divorced,’ Miss Nokes said, adding she was sent aggressive anonymous letters, threats and even pairs of pants in the post. Following these, she was ‘terrified’ in June last year when posts on the Fathers 4 Justice official Twitter account, run by the O’Connors, suggested that they were looking for her in her constituency. One post said: ‘F4J protesters working around Romsey and Wellow tonight looking for @carolinenokes MP to ask her why she broke her election promises.’ Caroline Nokes, MP for Romsey and Southampton North, appeared at the High Court on Friday along with former Tory lobbyist Adrian Yalland in a civil claim brought by Fathers 4 Justice founder Matt O’Connor . Another read: ‘@carolinenokes MP can run, but she can’t hide. @f4jofficial in Romsey and Wellow.’ Miss Nokes said: ‘I spent an entire night in my running gear. I’m not sure if that was to chase them down or to run from them. It was absolutely terrifying.’ Adrian Yalland is accused of assault, causing injury, unlawful trespass, breach of privacy, stalking and harassment in claim brought to court . After that, the MP said she took advice from the police and upgraded her security. ‘I have had cameras installed, I had a security report done. I have panic alarms installed and upgraded alarms and CCTV.’ But she also admits to driving her friend Mr Yalland to near the O’Connors’ house in Stockbridge, Hampshire, on February 20 this year, where a confrontation ensued. Miss Nokes insists she did not witness the incident. Mr Yalland – who also claims he was being abused by the O’Connors – was attempting to deliver his own lawsuit for libel against the couple but this led to the police being called. Mr Yalland was held on suspicion of assault but was never charged with any offence. The O’Connors have subsequently accused Miss Nokes of lying about her role in the incident, which she denies. On Friday, the dispute came to a head at the High Court in London, with the O’Connors accusing Miss Nokes and Mr Yalland of harassment and stalking. An application for an injunction against Mr Yalland was refused and he was awarded £500 costs. The case continues. Mr and Mrs O’Connor said last night: ‘Neither the O’Connors nor anyone from Fathers 4 Justice has been to the MP’s house, targeted her children or behaved in any inappropriate way.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Caroline Nokes dubbed ‘Cameron cutie’ when she was elected .

"Constance Briscoe, pictured is currently serving a 16-month jail term and is now facing a further police probe . A disgraced judge and best-selling author is facing fresh claims that she forged documentation to influence the outcome of a trial when her mother claimed libel against her, it can be revealed. Constance Briscoe, 56, is alleged to have created and signed a witness statement from a family friend to support claims she was abused by her mother and stepfather. Last night, the man whose signature is on the statement said: ‘I never made that statement or said those things.’ The Metropolitan Police have said the document will form part of an ongoing inquiry. A spokesman said the information ‘would be looked at and assessed accordingly.’ The revelation comes as Briscoe’s mother, who said the disputed statement was submitted to court, vowed to write her own book after being branded a child-beater in her daughter’s bestselling memoir Ugly, published in 2006. She added she would still like to visit her once high-flying daughter in jail. Briscoe, a mother-of-two who has just begun a 16-month jail term for covering up her role in the case of Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne and his former wife Vicky Pryce, made the abuse claims in her bestseller, which sold 500,000 copies worldwide.

"Tragedy: Dr Thomas McAfee died after stumbling and being trampled to death by an elephant while on safari in Tanzania . The sister of a former UC San Diego dean who was trampled to death by a herd of elephants while on Safari said that her brother knew the risks of getting close to Africa's wild animals. Skyli McAfee confirmed that her brother, Dr. Thomas McAfee, 58, had 'an accidental encounter with an elephant' while at Tanzania's 1,096-square-mile Tarangire National Park and tragically died as a result. Declining to give any more details about her brother's death, McAfee said that her brother was an experienced traveler who had been to Africa many times and knew that elephants were dangerous and unpredictable. 'My brother certainly was aware of those risks, but he was doing what he wanted to do,' said Skyli McAfee to UTSan Diego. 'He was supportive of conservation efforts and his family continues to be.' The American doctor killed in Tanzania after being trampled to death by an elephant, died because he lost his footing and fell while attempting to run from the animal. McAfee, 58, a dean at University of California was in Tarangire National Park on a luxury safari when the tragic accident occurred.

McAfee was enjoying a vacation before starting a new position as chief executive of the Keck Medicine of USC Medical Foundation. Hi body was taken to the Arusha Lutheran Medical Centre (ALMC) as arrangements were being made to ferry it home. There is no word yet on when his body will be flown back to the United States.

The editor of Sandberg's LeanIn.Org foundation, a nonprofit that goes by the same name as her bestselling book, posted this ad to Facebook looking for a free intern . The post, first reported on by Valley Wag, garnered hundreds of critical comments, mainly from people who argued that hiring a free intern is directly opposed to the stated goals of the nonprofit. 'When we've reached the point where working without pay is considered a legitimate ""opportunity,"" that's when you know something is seriously and fundamentally broken,' wrote Noella Paterson. Another commenter wrote: 'Why does lean in offer an unpaid internship? Really? I thought women should lean in and demand more money.

"Boris Johnson was today accused of 'unpleasant, careless elitism' after claiming some people were not bright enough to get on in the modern world. The London Mayor was condemned by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who accused the senior Conservative of talking about human beings like 'dogs'. Mr Johnson used a speech in tribute to Margaret Thatcher to argue that tackling economic inequality is ‘futile’ because some people’s IQ is too low for them to compete. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson, pictured on a visit last week, said some people were simply not bright enough to succeed in the modern world . Mr Johnson also hailed what he . called the ‘spirit of envy’, and said inequality was ‘essential’ for . economic growth. He called for the creation of a new generation of  grammar schools to help the brightest children from poor homes. He also appeared to echo the fictional film character Gordon Gekko, whose notorious motto was ‘greed is good’, saying that greed was ‘a valuable spur to economic activity’. But he insisted he did not want the economic recovery to breed a new generation of ‘heartless’ bankers. Delivering the annual Margaret Thatcher Lecture – staged by the right-wing Centre for Policy Studies think-tank – he insisted the rich had a duty to help the poor and embrace philanthropy.And he urged the Government to do much more to help bright children from poor homes to get a good education. London Mayor Boris Johnson . He called for the reintroduction of John Major’s assisted places scheme, which paid for the brightest poor children to go to public schools – and accused the Tories of hypocrisy for blocking a revival of the grammar school system. But his most controversial comments came when he said globalisation was intensifying the trend towards inequality. Mr Johnson said: ‘I am afraid that violent economic centrifuge is operating on human beings who are already very far from equal in raw ability, if not spiritual worth. ‘Whatever you may think of the value of IQ tests, it is surely  relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an IQ below 85, while about 2 per cent have an IQ above 130. ‘The harder you shake the pack, the easier it will be for some cornflakes to get to the top. And for one reason or another – boardroom greed or, as I am assured, the  natural and God-given talent of boardroom inhabitants – the income gap between the top cornflakes and the bottom cornflakes is getting wider than ever. ‘I stress I don’t believe that economic equality is possible. Indeed, some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the Joneses that is, like greed, a valuable spur to economic activity.’ Tribute: Mr Johnson made the comments at the third annual Margaret Thatcher Lecture - staged by the right-wing Centre for Policy Studies think-tank . But Mr Clegg condemned the remarks for writing off whole swathes of people who should be given the change to get on. 'I don’t agree with Boris Johnson on this,' he told his LBC 97.3 radio phone-in. 'Much as he is a funny and engaging guy, I have to say these comments reveal a fairly unpleasant, careless elitism that somehow suggests that we should give up on a whole swath of our fellow citizens. 'To talk about us as if we are a breed of dog, a species he called it... I think the danger is if you start taking such a deterministic view of people and start saying they’ve got a number attached to them, in this case an IQ number, somehow they’re not really going to rise to the top of the cornflake packet... 'That is complete anathema to everything I’ve always stood for in politics, which is, yes of course, you shouldn't aspire - and as an old-fashioned Liberal I don’t aspire to a perfectly homogenous society where everyone has the same kind of outcomes but you’ve got to try and do more to instil greater opportunity in society.' He accused some Tories of trying to relive the 1980s heyday of Margaret Thatcher's premiership. 'It is not 1986, it is 2013. Times have moved on.' Downing Street refused to be drawn into the row. David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'I don't know whether he has read Boris's speech but what I do know is the PM's view about the importance of equality of opportunity.' The Mayor of London, along with Prime Minister David Cameron, was educated at Eton College, Berkshire . Mr Johnson, who last week called for the ten biggest taxpayers to be handed knighthoods, acknowledged that growing inequality was creating ‘resentment’. He said ministers needed to do more to promote social mobility. ‘Though it would be wrong to  persecute the rich, and madness to try and stifle wealth creation, and futile to try to stamp out inequality, we should only tolerate this wealth gap on two conditions. ‘One, that we help those who  genuinely cannot compete; and, two, that we provide opportunity for those who can.’ Mr Johnson, who served as a shadow education minister under David Cameron, suggested the Tories had been guilty of hypocrisy in ruling out the creation of a new generation of grammar schools. Educated at Eton with Mr Cameron, the Mayor said: ‘I remember once sitting in a meeting of the Tory shadow education team and listening with mounting disbelief to a conversation in which we all agreed solemnly that it would be political madness to try to bring back the Grammar schools – while I happened to know that most of the people in that room were about to make use, as parents, of some of the most viciously selective schools in the country.’ He acknowledged that Mrs Thatcher had closed many grammar schools, but said that if she was here today he hoped she would find a way ‘to help bright children everywhere to overcome their background’. In a wide-ranging speech Mr Johnson also called for an end to the ‘madness’ of EU immigration.

Indeed, some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the  Joneses that is, like greed, a valuable spur to economic activity.’ ON THE RICH . ‘I hope that this time the Gordon  Gekkos of London are conspicuous not just for their greed ... as for what they give and do for the rest of the population.’ ON GRAMMARS . ‘I remember once sitting in a meeting of the Tory shadow education team and listening with mounting disbelief to a conversation in which we all agreed solemnly that it would be political madness to try to bring back the grammar schools ... most of the people in that room were about to make use, as parents, of some of the most viciously selective schools.’ ON IMMIGRATION . ‘It’s time to sort out the immigration system so that we end the madness ... we are claiming to have capped immigration by having a 60 per cent reduction in New Zealanders, when we can do nothing to stop the  entire population of Transylvania –  charming though most of them may be – from trying to come here.’","London Mayor said only those with high IQs could rise to the top .

"Argan oil is something of an all-round beauty superhero: the skin, hair and nail saviour is beloved by stars Kim Kardashian, Madonna and Selena Gomez for its rich, moisturising properties. And the oil, often dubbed 'liquid gold' due to its rarity and expense, is also . providing a lifeline for Berber women and their families in the . semi-desert Souss valley of south western Morocco, one of the only regions in . the world where the argan tree grows. Long used as a traditional remedy by Berber women to treat wrinkles, scars, and acne, argan oil is renowned for being incredibly moisturising, highly anti-inflammatory and easily absorbed. It's recently become one of the beauty world's biggest new breakthroughs, despite being known to Moroccans since the thirteenth century. Beauty secret: Radiant beauties Kim Kardashian, left, and Eva Mendes, right, swear by the power of argan oil - and the production of it in Morocco is helping women earn a living in a remote desert where work is hard to find . A relatively small geographical area - 9,900 square miles in southwestern Morocco - produces nearly all of the world’s argan oil. Because the trees are under threat, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) has declared the region a biosphere (an artificial structure enclosing a self-contained ecosystem) reserve in 1998. One large French company makes just over . half of the argan oil, and then there are lots of smaller cooperatives. One of the biggest companies to reap the oil is Neal's Yard Remedies, who support the Tighanimine Cooperative, the world’s first Fairtrade certified women’s Argan Oil cooperative. They the first women’s only argan cooperative and the first Fairtrade argan cooperative. NYR as a company were awarded 100 per cent for it’s ethical standards. Established in 2007 by women who met at a literacy class, it has now become a hugely successful cooperative providing women in the region with work to support their families. Today, the 60 members of the cooperative work in every area of the business, from collecting, transporting (by donkey), hand-cracking and pressing the nuts, and all have access to top administrative positions. Neal's Yard say is an incredible achievement anywhere, but particularly in the traditionally male-orientated Berber community. Hard at work: One of the biggest companies to reap the oil is Neal's Yard Remedies, who set up the Tighanimine Cooperative - a team of 60 Berber women who collect and harvest the nuts - all whilst clapping and singing . Where it all begins: Fatima and her team produce 1,000 litres of oil every month by hand cracking each and every nut to produce thousands of litres of argan oil . The income is helping to change not only the women’s lives, but also their family’s too. Once completely financially dependent on their husbands, the women can now contribute to the household income; many providing the family's only regular salary. They have money to send their children to school beyond primary school, giving them to opportunity to progress to high school and even university; and the women have access to literacy and health care training. Not surprisingly, the women’s self-esteem has had a massive boost. According to a spokeswoman at the cooperative, women now have more confidence in themselves because they feel important in their home. Making a living: A relatively small geographical area - 9,900 square miles in southwestern Morocco - produces nearly all of the world's argan oil . Lifeline: Susan Curtis, Natural Health Director at Neal's Yard Remedies with Nadia, President of the Tighanimine Cooperative . Fatima, 37, is married with four boys under 13 and was one of the original cooperative workers when she joined seven years ago. Fatima, who is the main breadwinner in her family, said: 'We speak together, dance together, work, joke and enjoy life together. 'Here in the countryside there would be no other work without argan. In the city you can do cleaning, but nothing else here.' Fatima and her team produce 1,000 litres of oil every month. A spokesperson for Neal's Yard Remedies said: 'In 2012 we were ordering one kilo of argan oil, since its popularity . has grown so rapidly in last couple of years, we are now ordering 900 . kilos. Finished product: The women collect, hand-crack and press the nuts to create this £17.50 Neal's Yard Remedy argan oil . 'At NYR we sell the oil on its own as part of our base oil . collection, as well as including it in other products, such as our organic lipsticks, mascara and body care products for its nourishing . properties. 'We have always strived to go above and beyond to be as ethical as possible, and recently we were awarded the first Health & Beauty company to achieve 100% under the Ethical Company Organisation's 'Ethical Accreditation' scheme.' And it seems the A-listers can't get enough of the beauty weapon. Supermodel Gisele Bundchen has long said that argan oil is an essential part of her beauty routine, while Eva Mendes said that the oil is her 'total skin secret' and described it as 'spectacular'. Katy Perry counts it as a huge part of prepping for a photo shoot and celebrities stylists say that when Salma Hayek and Taylor Swift prepare themselves . for photoshoots, they douse a few drops of argan oil into their skin and hair. Other fans include Charlize Theron, . Madonna, Kim Kardashian, Scarlet Johansson and French beauty . Marion Cotillard.

"The Duke of Edinburgh was taken to hospital yesterday, but in typical style the Queen continued with her Diamond Jubilee celebrations alone. Hours before the start of last night’s concert at Buckingham Palace, Prince Philip was taken by ambulance from Windsor Castle, where the royal couple had been resting following Sunday’s gruelling four-hour Thames pageant, after suffering abdominal pains. The Duke, who will celebrate his 91st birthday on Sunday and underwent minor heart surgery at Christmas, is now at the King Edward VII Hospital in London where he has been diagnosed with a bladder infection. Hospital: The Prince, who is due to celebrate his 91st birthday on Sunday, was today taken to King Edward VII Hospital in London . Buckingham Palace said he would remain under the care of doctors for several days as a ‘precautionary’ measure. ‘He is, understandably, disappointed . about missing this  evening’s Diamond Jubilee Concert and tomorrow’s . engagements,’ a spokesman said. Have you taken any pictures of the . Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations? From The Thames to your town, we . want to see them. Send them for publication - with plenty of caption . detail - to the Mail Online on the email address: mailonlinepictures@dailymail.co.uk . The Queen, who was by her husband’s . side when he left the castle, is being kept informed of his condition . but has no plans to visit him in hospital. And, with her husband’s blessing, she . immediately reassured her  aides that the rest of the planned Jubilee . events,  including today’s service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s . Cathedral followed by a  carriage procession through London and a . flypast over Buckingham Palace, would go ahead as planned. Last night members of the Royal Family poignantly  left the Duke’s seat in the  Royal Box at Buckingham  Palace empty. Prince Philip, pictured yesterday with the Queen, was today rushed to a London hospital after falling ill at Windsor Castle . Active: Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh takes part in the carriage driving at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last month . Energetic: Prince Philip lifts a car battery out of the way with little apparent difficulty at the Windsor Horse Show last month . Treatment: The King Edward VII Hospital in London where the Prince is tonight receiving specialist care for a bladder infection. He was treated at the same hospital for a bladder infection in 2002 . Bladder infections are much more common in women than men, but millions of men are afflicted each year. They usually develop quickly and can be serious, even life-threatening, without prompt treatment. The most common triggers include dehydration, poor immune system or an underlying medical problem such as enlarged prostate – which affects the vast majority of men in their 80s and older – bladder or kidney problems. Symptoms include the frequent need to go to the lavatory, fever, and sometimes blood in the urine. Diagnosis of a urinary tract infection (UTI) – the medical term – is normally confirmed by a simple urine test. Antibiotics are the first line of treatment and usually work within five to seven days for younger patients. However, if the infection is causing severe pain and the patient is elderly, hospital treatment may be prudent so that intravenous antibiotics can be administered. Scans may be necessary and if the patient develops antibiotic resistance – an increasing issue in hospitals – the drugs can be changed to something more powerful. UTIs may cause someone to feel unwell or create a sense of confusion and disorientation, which can be alarming when the sufferer is elderly. This is usually resolved as the antibiotics start working, but every precaution will be taken when the patient is elderly. The actual cause is bacteria within the patient’s body, which gets from its normal home in the bowel to the bladder which becomes infected. The infection may stay in the bladder or, more seriously, travel back to the kidneys. Dr Ian Banks, president of the Men’s Health Forum, said: ‘Prompt treatment should restore the Duke to health soon.’ The Queen was notably absent from the . beginning of the concert, organised by Take That star Gary Barlow, but . arrived half-way through, wearing a black cloak over a gold dress, in . time for Madness to sing their hits Our House and It Must Be Love from . the  palace roof. While the Duke’s condition is not . believed to be serious, doctors will not be taking any chances, given . his advancing years, because bladder  infections in the elderly can  get . worse very quickly if not treated promptly. Questions are likely to be asked . whether it was wise to allow the Duke, who had a stent inserted in his . heart less than six months ago, to take part in Sunday’s Diamond Jubilee . Pageant, standing in the rain for four hours. It is understood that staff at . ambulance control in Berkshire received a call from Windsor Castle . shortly after 2pm reporting that Prince Philip was  feeling unwell. The medical crew used a chair to help him into the ambulance. Despite his advancing years the . Queen’s husband has always enjoyed good health and most of his past . ailments have been sports-related. Before undergoing heart surgery at . Christmas his most recent previous illness was a cold in October last . year which forced him to pull out of an overnight stay in Italy. One of his most serious bouts of ill . health came in 2008 when he was admitted to hospital in London with a . chronic chest infection. The Duke’s absence from the rest of the Diamond Jubilee events will come as a terrible blow to his wife of 64 years. Although she is, ostensibly, the ‘senior partner’ in their relationship, she relies on her husband ‘utterly’. ‘It may be a cliché but he truly is the power behind the throne,’ said a source. Earlier this year the Duke, who is . linked to more than 800 organisations, announced plans to scale back on . all but his most important patronages, in the first nod he has  given to . his age. But he still carries out more than 350 engagements a year, making him one of the hardest-working members of the Royal Family. Three generations of Royals: The Duke of Edinburgh (centre) with Princes Charles, William and Harry yesterday on the Spirit of Chartwell during the Jubilee Pageant . Celebrations: Prince Philip (rear) arrives at Chelsea Pier yesterday at the start of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee events . Committed royal: Prince Philip, 90, waves to the crowd during the Thames pageant yesterday on a long day of celebrations . In an interview to mark his 90th birthday with the BBC, the outspoken Duke admitted he was reducing his workload. ‘I reckon I’ve done my bit, I want to enjoy myself for a bit now,’ he said. ‘With less responsibility, less rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say. ‘On top of that your memory’s going, I can’t remember  names. Yes, I’m just sort of winding down.’ For the majority of his 90 years, Prince Philip has been notable for his robust constitution, and most of the ailments that have troubled him have been sports-related or accidental. In 1961, the Duke broke a bone in his left ankle in a collision on the polo field. Three years later, he was X-rayed after pulling a ligament in his left shoulder in a fall from his polo pony. Polo also left him suffering from arthritis in his right wrist, a condition made worse by shaking many thousands of hands at official functions. More recently, in 2004, he was seen with dark glasses and a badly bruised left eye after slipping in the bath and catching the side of his eye with his thumb. In August 2008, Buckingham Palace . took the unusual step of speaking out to deny a newspaper report that the Duke had . been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The newspaper involved later apologised, saying it accepted the story was untrue. In January 2009, 87-year-old Philip . missed a string of engagements with a bad back after pulling a muscle . while carriage driving. And in 2009 he was forced to cancel several engagements after suffering a strained back – while carriage-driving – which left him in ‘excruciating pain’. Yet aides have admitted it is difficult to persuade Philip to slow down, with one saying: ‘No one would ever dare tell him to take it easy – you might as well take your life in your hands.’ In May 2006, the Duke pulled out of a royal engagement after suffering from a trapped nerve in his neck. After a weekend recovering, he attended the Chelsea Flower Show, appearing none the worse for wear. In 2008, the Duke was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital in London with a chronic chest infection. At the time, senior royal sources told the Mail they had quite a job persuading him to seek further treatment after failing to fight off a heavy cold. The Duke vociferously protested that Dr John Cunningham, the Queen’s personal physician, was over-reacting. But after battling the infection for several days, he finally accepted the doctor’s advice. ‘Typically, the Duke grumbled and complained,’ said a source. ‘He did not want to go in. He really isn’t the best kind of patient.’ Not a single member of his family paid him a visit during his three-night stay, although aides said that it was just the way he liked it. ‘The Duke cannot bear anyone making a fuss. It would have been the last thing he wanted,’ said one.","The Prince, 90, has a bladder infection and will be in hospital 'for a few days'

"Daisy Coleman became suicidal after she was allegedly raped at age 14, then tormented by cyber bullies, her mother says . A teenager whose family was driven out of town after she reported being raped by a popular footballer says she thinks authorities treated her case differently because of his family's 'prominent political' status. High school freshman Daisy Coleman claims she was . subjected to constant cyber-bullying from classmates - and even parents . - in Maryville, Missouri, after she reported in January 2012 that . she had been raped. She told police the 17-year-old boy invited her to a . party where she became so intoxicated she couldn't stand and then had . sex with her while a friend filmed the incident on an iPhone. The athlete and his friends then . allegedly dumped Daisy on her front porch, where she passed out - with . no shoes or socks and no coat - in 22-degree (-5C) weather. When her mother . found her several hours later, Daisy's hair was frozen and she had . frostbite on her hands and feet. Daisy claimed she had been raped by Matthew Barnett. A case against Barnett was dropped because the sheriff said Daisy declined to cooperate with prosecutors, according to CNN. Prosecutor Robert Rice eventually dropped all charges against Barnett, who claimed the sex was consensual, reported the Huffington Post. The family claim they were the victims of caustic bullying. Daisy's brothers were threatened at school and booed on the field and her mother Melinda Coleman, a veterinarian, lost her job as a result of the police report her daughter filed, according to The Kansas City Star. Mrs Coleman said she was left with no choice but to leave the town to protect her family. Eight months later their former Maryville home, which was on the market, was mysteriously burnt to the ground. Speaking yesterday to CNN's 'Erin Burnett OutFront', the teenager said she believes the 'prominent political family' of the accused, known as 'Matt', played a role in how her case was managed by authorities. The charred remains of the fire-damaged home of Melinda Coleman and her children in October. The cause of the fire could not be determined . Accusations: Daisy, pictured left with her brother, told police that she became so drunk she couldn't remember anything at a party thrown by several older high school boys . On the night of the alleged sexual assault, Daisy said she and a friend had been drinking at home and watching scary movies. She had been texting Matt, who was 17 at the time. She told CNN that they snuck out the window and Matt picked them up and drove them to his house, where they crept in through a basement window. 'He gave me a big glass of a clear liquid. And that's all I remember,' the teenager said yesterday on CNN. Mrs Coleman found her daughter scratching at the front door at around 5am the next morning. Her hair was wet and frozen and she had frostbite. 'There was frost on the ground,' Daisy's mother Melinda Coleman told CNN. 'It . wasn't until I undressed her to put her in a warm tub that I realised . that maybe she had been sexually assaulted. So I asked her if she was . hurting, and she said yes, and started to cry,' she said. Mrs Coleman told CNN that she and her daughter told police everything from the hospital that morning. They deny claims that the case was not brought to court because they chose not to testify. After Daisy reported the alleged rape, the family started to receive abuse. Mrs Coleman said she had no . choice but leave. Town officials and many residents had made it clear . that she was no longer welcome in the town of 12,000, she said. 'Basically . I was terrified, I wanted to protect my children, I wanted to get them . out of there,' she told MailOnline, agreeing that her family's names and photographs be used to highlight their case. In April, eight months after she left town, Mrs Coleman's house in Maryville - which she was trying to sell - burned down. Fire investigators have ruled the cause 'undetermined,' but Mrs Coleman told MailOnline that she suspects the blaze could be arson - connected with town residents who were furious over her daughter's rape allegations. Daisy, seen here with her three brothers, was threatened by residents of Maryville after the charges against a popular football player went public. Her brothers were threatened and harassed, as well . 'On one hand, it would almost be a . comfort to think it was an electrical problem that caused the fire, but . on the other other hand, there’s a part of me that really thinks that . the fire could be part of all this,' Mrs Coleman said. 'They threatened me. I’d been threatened and my daughter had been threatened and I lost my job because of threats.' But Mrs Coleman and her daughter Daisy say they still want to see justice served, and both said they would testify. Mrs Coleman told CNN she was approached by several other girls in the aftermath of her daughter's rape report, who also claimed 'the same thing happened to them with the same group of boys'. Melinda Coleman, Daisy's mother, said she feared for her family's safety after she and her children received threats . She said she told the sheriff who revealed as many as ten girls had reported similar events, but he later claimed they were all liars. 'So my concern is what is it going to take for them to do something here? Does one of the girls have to die? Are they going to end up freezing in the front yard before they do something?' She added: 'I would like to see the case reopened and I'd like to see some justice. I'd like to see the other girls come forward without fear.' Mrs Coleman she moved her family to . Maryville after her husband, a doctor, died in a car crash in 2006. She . was hoping for a fresh start for herself and for her children. Sheriff's deputies arrested two teens within hours and charged them with felonies. The 17 year old is said to have admitted to the sex but he insisted that it was consensual. A few weeks later, the prosecutor, Robert Rice, dropped the rape charges - citing insufficient evidence. Mrs Coleman told MailOnline the torrents of hatred came only days after the case went public. The backlash on social media was . vitriolic. Classmates said the Daisy had been 'asking for it' at the party. A girl showed . up to one of the teen girl's dance recitals with a shirt alluding to . the alleged rape. When the charges against her alleged rapist were dismissed, one local . student wrote to the teen on Twitter, saying, 'F*** yea. That’s what you . get for bein a skank : )'. One of Daisy's brothers was booed at his final wrestling match of the . year. Mrs Coleman says a friend warned her that students were planning . to beat up her sons in the parking lot of the high school over the . incident. Mrs . Coleman lost her job at the local veterinary clinic. She . says her boss admitted that she was fired because the case had become . too contentious. Veterinarian . Sally Hayse told the Star: 'This is a small community, and it . definitely was stressful for us here, without a doubt. The entrance of Maryville High School - High school freshman Daisy Coleman was subjected to constant bullying from classmates - and even parents - in Maryville, Missouri, after she reported she had been raped in January 2012 . Life at Maryville High School became difficult for the four Coleman children after numerous former friends lashed out over the sex assault report . Maryville is a tight-knit town of 12,000 in rural northern Missouri . But, she said, 'If you were to ask me point-blank (why Mrs Coleman was fired), I would say it’s because our style of medicine didn’t jive.' Mrs Coleman said her daughter suffered heavily - both from the alleged assault and from the online abuse. She tried to kill herself twice, including once when her brother found her in the bathroom and took her to the hospital. 'She had a really hard time. She went through a period, a really dark time. She did the self-mutilation and the anger,' Mrs Coleman told MailOnline. 'So much of being told it was her fault ... it really does seem like it’s your fault when people keep saying it over and over again.' But, Daisy, now 16, is recovering, her mother says. After intensive therapy, she is beginning to move past the trauma of the alleged attack.","Melinda Coleman says she and her family had to leave Maryville, Missouri, after intense backlash when her daughter said she was raped at a party .

"French bus drivers in Marseille are to strike because their new uniform trousers are too tight. The 1,600 workers at the RTM public transport company have announced their plans for a 24-hour walkout in June over the quality, colour and fit of the trousers. The colour of their work shirts has also changed from yellow to lavender, but union leaders are angered by the close-fitting bottoms. The 1,600 drivers at the state-run RTM in Marseille are to walk out in June over their new uniforms . Bernard Gargiolo, leader of the CGT transport union, said: 'We reject the bottom half of this new uniform, which is the same colour as the Gendarmes [French police] wear. 'The employees don't want to wear a uniform that was chosen unilaterally by the management, without taking into account the views of our clothing committee.' And one bus driver told the city's La Provence newspaper: 'I won't be wearing them. They make us look like we work for the Speedy! car repair company. 'The shirts are alright, but these trousers are far too tight.' The new uniform's designer Jonathan Charles defended his creation, adding: 'People are saying they look like clowns. Well, that was already the case with the old outfits.' France has the most strikes in Europe, though former president Nicolas Sarkozy decreed that public transport workers must give a 48-hour warning before a walkout or face sanctions. Unions say this is to suppress the strike from gaining momentum among other workers by making them wait to join in, and makes it easier for employers to keep watch over employees. Between 2005 and 2009, the country lost 132 days per 1,000 workers to strike action. Around the world, only Canada and South Africa outdo the French in their willingness to walk out.","1,600 drivers at RTM in Marseille to strike in June .

"The General Medical Council planted ¿spies¿ who listened to the private conversations of the mother of a rape victim who made a complaint against a doctor, it has been claimed (file photo) The General Medical Council planted ‘spies’ who listened to the private conversations of the mother of a rape victim who made a complaint against a doctor, it has been claimed. Plainclothes security guards were employed to shadow the woman at the fitness-to-practice hearing, where she accused the doctor of missing signs that her disabled daughter had been raped at a boarding school. During the hearing, the guards told the woman they were on ‘work experience’ for the GMC. They followed her into meetings with lawyers and even into the lavatories, . Ministers last night demanded an urgent investigation into the doctors’ regulator, which has now admitted hiring non-uniformed guards during fitness-to-practice hearings where doctors are charged with serious professional misconduct. The GMC said that it did so only to ensure ‘there was no risk of disruption to proceedings’. It added that an unnamed security firm had signed a confidentiality clause to ensure information was not inappropriately shared. But while the doctor, his solicitor and the GMC panel of experts were all told about the covert arrangement, neither the mother nor her legal team were informed. Last night, MPs and lawyers expressed dismay at the GMC’s secret policy, which, they said, could have potentially prejudiced this and other cases. Health Minister Norman Lamb said: ‘It is very hard to understand how it can be right to have security guards present, known about by everyone except the complainant. ‘That doesn’t sound like proper justice and inevitably raises the concern that privileged information is reported back to the other side.’ The GMC said the covert policy had been used since 2007 and 16 times in the last three years – meaning tens of cases have been potentially prejudiced. The mother, identified only as JXS under a High Court ruling, attended a four-day hearing in December when two non-uniformed people walked into the room where she and a female lay representative were discussing the case. She said: ‘There was a young girl and an older man. They said they were on work experience with the GMC and following people in different departments. I believed them, we spoke to them casually and thought no more of it. ‘When I spoke to my barrister on the phone, one of them was there and one of them overheard a conversation I was having with my GP. Last night, MPs and lawyers expressed dismay at the GMC¿s secret policy, which, they said, could have potentially prejudiced this and other cases (file photo) ‘I actually feel violated. It is unforgivable and inexcusable. How many other people has this happened to?’ JXS, who only discovered the deception last month during disclosure in another aspect of the case, added: ‘They spied on us. They listened to conversations we would never have had if we had known.’ Melinda Nettleton, JXS’s barrister, said the GMC could face a misfeasance in public office charge and that the policy might have breached the Human Rights Act, adding she and JXS were followed under the same ruse at a one-day hearing in the same case last August. She said: ‘The guards were constantly hanging about whether we were going to the loo or the coffee machine, and while I wasn’t present at the December hearing, my client was calling me with a lot of privileged information. I am astounded I was lied to and can’t believe anybody behaved like that. ‘What message does it give to the adjudicating panel that it is necessary to police the victim’s mother?’ GMC chief executive Niall Dickson said it had written to the mother to apologise and will ‘reflect on lessons to be learned’. He added: ‘We will report back to her on the actions we have taken to make sure this does not happen again .","Plainclothes guards were employed at the fitness-to-practice hearing .

"Another top BBC executive has been found guilty of bullying staff, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Mark Sandell, a senior editor and partner of Radio 5 Live presenter Victoria Derbyshire, also faces claims of sexual harassment against a female employee. Last night, the BBC also confirmed that his expenses claims were being scrutinised. Under scrutiny: Mark Sandell, a senior editor at the BBC and partner of radio host Victoria Derbyshire . The latest investigation follows outrage after BBC bosses were accused last week of ‘fudging’ the case of Newsbeat editor Rod McKenzie. He moved to another job after he was found to have  bullied several staff. There are wider concerns of a bullying culture at the organisation. Some staff feel the decision not to sack McKenzie contradicts assurances by Lord Hall, the BBC director-general, who said there would be a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to bullying last year.  Last night, a BBC insider said: ‘The upshot is that staff will not bring cases forward now. That is the most damaging thing.’ After a lengthy process involving Mr Sandell, editor of the BBC’s World Have Your Say, a disciplinary upheld a bullying claim but is still looking at the allegation of sexual harassment, it can be revealed. Separately, it is understood Mr  Sandell’s expenses are still being investigated by the BBC’s Investigation Unit. BBC Radio 5 host Victoria Derbyshire has two children with Sandell . Mr Sandell, who remains in his job while the various disciplinary processes conclude, was married to BBC presenter Fi Glover for two years. He left her in 2002 for BBC Radio 5  presenter Ms Derbyshire, with whom he has two children. World Have Your Say, which broadcasts on radio on The World Service and TV on BBC World News, is one of the Corporation’s flagship shows abroad and is watched and listened to by millions of people worldwide. One well-placed source said: ‘Mr Sandell is someone who is known to have had a reputation for as long as he has been at the BBC. He was at 5 Live and other parts of the BBC and his reputation goes before him. ‘There have been previous complaints [of bullying] against him.’ It is not known if these claims have ever been investigated. Rod McKenzie was moved from his job as head of Newsbeat, Radio 1’s news bulletin, after being investigated for more than 30 complaints. Mr McKenzie denied the allegations, some of which were not upheld, but was given a final written warning and posted to another, as yet undisclosed, post. But some who complained have accused the BBC of failing to protect whistle-blowers, adding management appeared to side with Mr McKenzie, who has taken a month’s leave. Ceri Thomas, the BBC’s head of programmes, briefed Newsbeat staff on the McKenzie situation last week and said Mr McKenzie had ‘many more expressions and testimonials of support than criticism’. One complainant, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It is outrageous for someone from management to say that. Obviously those that gave testimonials were not the ones who were bullied.’ Another BBC insider said the result of the McKenzie complaint would leave staff deflated. The insider said: ‘People are very angry and the upshot is that staff will not bring cases forward now, that is the most damaging thing.’ A source close to Mr McKenzie said: . 'Rod rejects these claims and maintains that his behaviour was entirely in keeping with a pressured news environment.' A former member of the Newsbeat staff defended Mr McKenzie, saying: 'The idea that there was a culture of paranoia and fear about Newsbeat is nonsense. There's a greater proportion of past and current staff who would describe him as an uncompromising but brilliant and inspiring boss. 'Tough, yes, but always fair and wanting to get the very best out of everyone. My experience in Rod's newsroom set me and many others up to go and have successful careers elsewhere and still work by his high standards."" Another former colleague added: 'He was always very encouraging to young talent and very supportive. I don't recognise these descriptions of his behaviour.' Conservative MP Rob Wilson has written to Lord Hall about the McKenzie issue. He said: ‘This decision looks like a fudge and I’m sure that victims of bullying across the BBC will feel a sense of betrayal. Sandell was married to BBC presenter Fi Glover for two years, but left her in 2002 . ‘It is bound to damage their confidence that their employer will stand up for them in cases of bullying.’ Following the Jimmy Savile scandal, the BBC commissioned Dinah Rose QC to look at its bullying and sexual harassment procedures. The Respect At Work review, also known as the Rose report, received submissions from more than 930 individuals and made a series of recommendations, including resolving accusations within 30 days and launching a confidential hotline where staff can report abuse. The investigations into the complaints against Mr Sandell have lasted at least six months to date, while Mr McKenzie’s case took almost a year to resolve. After the Rose review’s publication, Lord Hall said the report made ‘uncomfortable reading’. He said: ‘We need to be honest about our shortcomings and single minded in addressing them. ‘I want zero tolerance of bullying and a culture where people feel able to raise concerns and have the confidence that they will be dealt with appropriately.’ But last week the Department for Culture, Media and Sport revealed there were 42 incidents of whistle-blowing at the BBC in 2012, with 22 of these reported via the hotline. In the first nine months of 2013, the rate of calls fell to 23, with six coming through the hotline. A BBC spokesman said the Corporation would ‘not comment on staff matters’. But he said: ‘Bullying or harassment will not be tolerated at the BBC. We are implementing all Respect at Work recommendations and the BBC is leading the industry in the way it supports staff with complaints. With ambitious targets and a raft of new support for staff we are committed to ensuring all complaints are dealt with as quickly and fairly as possible.’ Regarding why cases are taking too long to resolve, he added: ‘While we are committed to dealing with cases in a timely fashion, the most important factor is that they are considered properly and fairly. ‘For the most complex cases this may mean they could take longer than 30 days to consider, particularly where multiple interviews are needed. Also, some cases have involved a subsequent disciplinary and appeals processes.’","Mark Sandell said to be bullying staff, faces claims of sexual harassment and his expenses are being scrutinised .

"A seven-year-old brain tumour victim helped diagnose his mother's breast cancer after giving her a hug. Michaela Dawson said were it not for the cuddle with her son Josh, a lump in her breast may have gone unnoticed. As Josh climbed on to his mother's lap and pressed into her chest, Ms Dawson felt an unbearable, sharp pain. She discovered a lump and booked a doctor's appointment. Michaela Dawson was diagnosed with breast cancer in June, after her seven-year-old son Josh, pictured, climbed on her lap for a cuddle, causing the 47-year-old to suffer severe chest pain . The single mother said her world fell apart when her GP revealed a mammogram had revealed the lump was cancerous. It was the second time the family had been struck by a cancer diagnosis. In 2012, Josh was diagnosed with ependymoma, a rare brain tumour, which affects 450 people in the UK each year. Ms Dawson, from Seaton Carew in Hartlepool, said: 'I was completely gutted after what our family went through with Josh, the first thing that came to my mind when they said it was cancer was ""Oh here we go again"". 'Josh is quite needy like any youngster, and he wanted to have a cuddle so he grabbed on to me. When one of his hands rested on me, I felt this blinding pain and had to sit down. 'He kept saying that I was hurt and when I touched the sore part of my breast, I felt a lump and my heart sank. 'I was given my diagnosis on Josh’s seventh birthday, if it wasn’t for that morning hug in June I may never have found the cancer. 'After Josh was diagnosed with a brain tumour two years ago, I kept thinking ‘why us again?’ I was numb after his ordeal. 'He had to go through life saving surgery to remove the cancer and we were afraid that was it.' After a successful operation and radiotherapy treatment, Josh has now been given the all-clear. Josh was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour in 2012, but following an operation and radiotherapy, the youngster has been given the all-clear . Ms Dawson said: 'No one ever imagines that they will be affected by cancer, so to have to deal with it twice was a huge blow' The mother-of-two has just undergone surgery to remove the tumour and half of the lymph nodes from her underarm. Although the family are now facing fresh anguish after Ms Dawson's bombshell diagnosis, she is determined to be as brave as her son and to beat the cancer. The former school cook, who is also mother to 22-year-old Stephanie, added: 'The surgery went well and although I am a bit sore, I keep thinking about how brave Josh was. 'He didn’t complain once during any of his treatment. 'I am due to start chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the next few weeks. If he can do it then so can I. 'No one ever imagines that they will be affected by cancer, so to have to deal with it twice was a huge blow. 'Even though it has come as a shock I want to do my son proud.'","Michaela Dawson was diagnosed with breast cancer in June .

"Arsenal wonderkid Wellington Silva has revealed that he will finally be allowed to play for the Gunners first team, having been granted Spanish citizenship. The Brazilian winger, who has been labelled the next Neymar, has been unable to play for Arsene Wenger's side since his £3.5million move from Figueirense in 2009 - which was delayed until 2011 due to his age - due to work permit issues. However, Silva's time spent on loan at Spanish clubs Alcoyano, Ponferradina, Real Murcia and Almeria mean he will now be eligible to play in the UK. Wellington Silva has been granted Spanish citizenship, meaning he will be able to play for Arsenal next season . 'It's true,' the 21-year-old told reporters when questioned about his Spanish citizenship. ‘I can now go back to Arsenal from next season. I would be very happy if I could become an idol at a club like Arsenal. ‘I will give my best to become a great player.’ He has played in friendlies for Arsenal but was denied his 'Special Talent Visa' in 2011 and therefore his work permit and it was then the Gunners sent him out on loan. He has played in La Liga and the Segunda Division while in Spain, with the majority of his time spent in the second tier.

"The BBC was last night accused of ‘playing musical chairs’ after a senior executive was found guilty of bullying but then moved to what has been described as a ‘plum job’ in the Corporation. Jim Buchanan, a news chief, received a written warning after a year-long investigation upheld claims that he bullied and intimidated staff. The complaints were said to be about verbal abuse and sending intimidating emails to colleagues. But yesterday sources said Mr Buchanan had been moved to another senior role, leading to criticism that the Corporation was again failing to take bullying claims seriously. Jim Buchanan: News chief given written warning over staff complaints but has new senior role and is described as 'untouchable' Despite pledges by Lord Hall, the BBC Director General, to  introduce a ‘zero tolerance’ of  bullying, insiders expressed  outrage that some managers appeared to be ‘untouchable’ and were ‘effectively promoted’ rather than disciplined when found guilty. As the BBC reels from the  departure of well-respected arts  presenter Mark Lawson, who left last week after at least 15 staff complained about his behaviour, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Mr Buchanan, head of deployment for home news, is the third senior manager in two months to be found guilty of bullying but keep his job. Mark Sandell, husband of Radio 5 presenter Victoria Derbyshire and the editor of BBC radio’s World Have Your Say, has been moved from his department while a case of sexual harassment is investigated. Mark Sandell, left, editor of World Have Your Say remains working for the World service while an allegation of sexual harassment is investigated. Rod McKenzie, right, lost his job as head of Radio 1's Newsbeat after more than 30 complaints but has been given another executive role . Claims of bullying have already been upheld against him, the BBC have confirmed, but it is understood that Mr Sandell is working on other projects in the World Service while the investigation concludes. One senior BBC source said members of Mr Sandell’s team were rallying around him, with some writing to say they wanted him back on the  programmes. The Buchanan saga has echoes of the recent case involving Rod McKenzie, the Radio 1 news editor who was moved sideways into another department despite having numerous complaints upheld against him. This led to widespread criticism of the Corporation’s supposed new tough stance on bullying which was the result of a damning report into BBC culture by Dinah Rose QC. Mr McKenzie was moved from his job as head of Newsbeat, Radio 1’s news programme aimed at youngsters, after being investigated for more than 30 complaints. Lat week well-respected arts  presenter Mark Lawson left the BBC after at least 15 staff complained about his behaviour . He denied the allegations, some of which were not upheld, but was given a final written warning and moved to a position of head of development for local radio. Tomorrow Mr Buchanan, who worked as a journalist at ITN before joining the BBC, is due to start as head of outside broadcasts for the World War One project on the same pay, sources said. He is known to have a keen interest in wartime history and even started a project called Rutland Remembers, to commemorate those who fell in the First World War. One BBC insider criticised his new role, saying: ‘It is effectively a promotion for him.’ Another said: ‘He has been moved to a plum job – he has been given the keys to the sweet shop. ‘You can imagine how a lot of the people who raised complaints feel. It adds to the feeling that many have that some managers are untouchable. It is McKenzie all over again. ‘The bullying really affected a lot of people. After the complaint was finally finished one person said to me, “I can finally sleep now.” Others who said they thought they were quite resolute and could cope with it also admitted they were struggling.’ Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Commons Culture Select Committee, pointed to a 'cultural problem' of bullying within the BBC . Several BBC workers made complaints of bullying and intimidation against Mr Buchanan last year, with other staff providing statements in support of those making the claims, it is understood. Some complaints were not upheld, though the BBC would not disclose which. The source added: ‘A lot of those that complained about Buchanan do not even know what parts of the allegations were upheld. They were not allowed to see the judgment or know how those looking at the complaint came to their decisions.’ Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Commons Culture Select Committee, said that he could not comment on individual cases, but pointed to a ‘cultural problem’ of bullying within the BBC. ‘It seems to me that they have a serious issue that needs tackling. There appears to be a cultural problem within the BBC. The organisation is playing musical chairs which is perpetuating the problem. ‘Tony Hall’s definition of zero tolerance is totally different from mine. In my organisation, bullies would be out.’ Mystery still surrounds the departure of Mr Lawson, who interviewed thousands of famous names including Dame Helen Mirren, Robert De Niro and Woody Allen. He left the Corporation after a petition signed by 15 journalists complained about problems in the BBC’s arts department and led to him and an unnamed producer being cited for bullying. Last week Lawson released a statement which said: ‘The BBC and I have agreed that I should step down as presenter of [arts programme] Front Row and for personal reasons I shall be taking a break from live daily radio journalism.’ He added: ‘It has been an extraordinary experience and privilege to work on the programme for 16 years and I very much hope to be able to return to work on Radio 4 in the future.’ The BBC commissioned Dinah Rose to look at its bullying and sexual harassment procedures following the Jimmy Savile scandal. Her Respect At Work review, also known as the Rose Report, received submissions from more than 930 individuals and made recommendations, including resolving accusations within 30 days, and launching a confidential hotline through which staff could report abuse. The BBC said cases of bullying at the organisation are always dealt with and staff are supported when they make complaints - maintaining a confidential process . In an interview last week Lord Hall said: ‘What happens when you say you won’t tolerate bullying and harassment is that you get a hump of more cases coming forward. That’s to be expected. ‘These things take a lot of careful management but I want a culture where people can come to work and feel they are valued and don’t feel bullied. These are not easy things to deal with but we are working our way through that.’ A BBC spokesman said last night: ‘We do not comment on individual cases but where we find instances of bullying they will be dealt with. ‘The BBC is leading the industry in the way we support staff with complaints and this includes maintaining a confidential and fair process. ‘The fact that we do not comment on individual cases does not indicate that the BBC accepts that suggestions put to us by any newspaper are factually accurate.’","News chief Jim Buchanan investigated over claims he intimidated staff .

"What appear to be three bodies have been spotted on Mount Rainier in an area where six climbers went missing earlier this summer, National Park officials said Tuesday. The bodies were seen last week during a helicopter flight by park staff members, park spokeswoman Patti Wold said, adding that officials were trying to determine how to recover them without endangering rescuers. 'Rock and ice fall off the steep wall and an increase in new crevasses in the glacier below make this one of the most hazardous locations in the park,' Wold wrote in an email. Authorities believe the two guides and four climbers fell 3,300 feet during the dangerous climb in Washinton during the last week of May. Uday Marty (left) vice president of . Intel Corp. in Southeast Asia and climbing guide Eitan Green (right) are . believed to be among climbers likely to have plummeted to their deaths . on Mount Rainier in Washington in May . Amongst the six climbers missing on Mount . Rainier and presumed dead are guide Matt Hegeman (left) and climber Mark . Mahaney (right) Six climbers, including two guides, are now . believed to have fallen more than 3,000 feet to their deaths while . ascending Mount Rainier, a dormant volcano in Washington state . During the initial search, crews found gear and detected signals from avalanche beacons buried in the snow at the top of Carbon Glacier at 9,500 feet.  It's unknown whether a rock fall or avalanche was to blame for the fall. All six people were experienced climbers who were taking a technical, challenging route to the top of the 14,410-foot (4,392-meter) mountain southeast of Seattle. Known as the Liberty Ridge route, it is not currently being climbed due to unstable conditions caused by increased rock and icefall from warm weather, Wold said. Last year, about 10,800 people attempted to climb Mount Rainier and only 129 used the Liberty Ridge route, according to park statistics. The vast majority use two other popular routes. The missing climbers had traveled from as far away as Singapore, Minnesota and New York to ascend the glacial peak. Experienced climber Mark Mahaney was on his second trip up Mount Rainier in Washington state . The climbers were last heard from via satellite phone about two days into their journey, when they had reached a height of 12,800 feet . Members of the group were Seattle-based Alpine Ascents International guides Matthew Hegeman and Eitan Green; Erik Britton Kolb, a 34-year-old finance manager at American Express, who had traveled from New York; Uday Marty, a vice president and managing director of Intel in Southeast Asia who was based in Singapore; Seattle mountain climber John Mullally; and Mark Mahaney, of St. Paul, Minnesota. Wold said that the Chinook flight out of Joint Base Lewis McChord was part of the park's ongoing limited search of the area for the climbers. According to his biography on Intel's website, Mr Marty, 40, managed sales and marketing in the region and had previously managed global notebook marketing out of the company's headquarters in Santa Clara, California. He joined the company in 1996. The firm's spokesman Bill Calder said he was 'widely loved and respected at this company. 'We are most definitely mourning his loss here,' he added. 'He was a guy with a great attitude, and he always had a big smile.' Alpine Ascents identified Matthew Hegeman, the lead guide as intense and philosophical with a good sense of humor. Another guide, Eitan Green, was described as being a 'strong leader' and quick to smile, the website said.","Climbers last heard from while they were in Liberty Ridge area at 12,800 ft .

"Most people don't give a second thought when tucking into a plate of salad. But perhaps we should be a bit more considerate when chomping on lettuce, as scientists have found that plants actually respond defensively to the sounds of themselves being eaten. The researchers at the University of Missouri (MU) found that plants can identify sounds nearby, such as the sound of eating, and then react to the threats in their environment. Scroll down for video . Researchers at the University of Missouri have determined that plants respond to the sounds that caterpillars make when eating and that the plants then respond with more defenses. Here a cabbage butterfly caterpillar feeds on an Arabidopsis plant with a piece of reflective tape helping to record vibrations . 'Previous research has investigated how plants respond to acoustic energy, including music,' said Heidi Appel, senior research scientist in the Division of Plant Sciences in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources and the Bond Life Sciences Center at MU. Researchers in Bonn, Germany, found plants give off a gas when under 'attack'. Super-sensitive microphones picked up a 'bubbling' sound from a healthy plant. But this rose to a piercing screech when it was under threat. Even a tiny insect bite could have an effect. 'The more a plant is subjected to stress, the louder the signal,' said Dr Frank Kühnemann. Plants do not actually scream in pain. But different sounds are heard when the gas they emit, ethylene, is bombarded with lasers. The research could help to work out which pieces of fruit and vegetables are likely to stay fresh longer, as a cucumber which is starting to go off produces a squealing sound. It could then be separated from the fresher ones. 'However, our work is the first example of how plants respond to an ecologically relevant vibration. 'We found that ""feeding vibrations"" signal changes in the plant cells' metabolism, creating more defensive chemicals that can repel attacks from caterpillars.' Appel collaborated with Rex Cocroft, professor in the Division of Biological Sciences at MU. In the study, caterpillars were placed on Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant related to cabbage and mustard. Using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant, Cocroft was able to measure the movement of the leaf in response to the chewing caterpillar. Cocroft and Appel then played back recordings of caterpillar feeding vibrations to one set of plants, but played back only silence to the other set of plants. When caterpillars later fed on both sets of plants, the researchers found that the plants previously exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils, a chemical that is unappealing to many caterpillars. 'What is remarkable is that the plants exposed to different vibrations, including those made by a gentle wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not increase their chemical defenses,' Cocroft said. 'This indicates that the plants are able to distinguish feeding vibrations from other common sources of environmental vibration.' Heidi Appel (left) and Rex Cocroft (right) from the University of Missouri led the research. In the study, caterpillars were placed on a plant and, using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant, the team measured the movement of the leaf in response to the chewing caterpillar . Appel and Cocroft say future research will focus on how vibrations are sensed by the plants, what features of the complex vibrational signal are important, and how the mechanical vibrations interact with other forms of plant information to generate protective responses to pests. 'Plants have many ways to detect insect attack, but feeding vibrations are likely the fastest way for distant parts of the plant to perceive the attack and begin to increase their defenses,' Cocroft said. 'Caterpillars react to this chemical defense by crawling away, so using vibrations to enhance plant defenses could be useful to agriculture,' Appel said. 'This research also opens the window of plant behavior a little wider, showing that plants have many of the same responses to outside influences that animals do, even though the responses look different.' The study, 'Plants respond to leaf vibrations caused by insect herbivore chewing,' was funded in part by the National Science Foundation and was published in Oecologia.","Researchers from the University of Missouri found plants respond to attack .
They discovered the sound of caterpillars eating made them more defensive .
Plants that heard caterpillar sounds released more mustard oils, which are unappealing to caterpillars and thus ward them off .
But plants that heard the wind, despite having a similar acoustic sound, knew not to waste their defensive capabilities .
This suggests plants are able to identify sounds in their environment ."

"Japan’s penchant for heated toilets has resulted in an Australian invasion of deadly redback spiders. An Australian song that warns people to ‘beware of the redback spider on the toilet seat at night’ couldn't be more true than in Japan after large numbers of the potentially fatal insect have been found in a Tokyo suburb. The dangerous long-legged spider with a distinctive red body is a native of Australia, but somehow has found its way to Japan, where it lurks in dark corners. The long-legged spider is a native of Australia, but has found its way to Japan and is believed to have survived their harsh winters thanks to heat spread into bathroom walls from the toilet seats . Experts had initially believed the tropical spider could never survive the bitingly-cold Japanese winters - but it is now thought that the heated toilets many Japanese have in their homes have provided a perfect winter hideaway. While the insects haven’t literally slept the winter away under Japanese toilet seats, the warmth spread from them into bathroom walls has provided comfort from the cold. Now, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports, Australian experts have warned that Japan’s medical system is not ready for an invasion of the potentially deadly spider because limited supplies of anti-venom are available to authorities. About a dozen of the venomous insects have been found in the Tokyo residential district of Mitaka, terrifying parents. About a dozen of the venomous insects have been found in the Tokyo residential district of Mitaka, terrifying parents . Although the insects were quickly rounded up and exterminated, government official Motosugu Tanaka said local authorities would not be able to stop them from moving into other areas. ‘It’s unthinkable that they only exist in Mitaka, so they’ll probably be found in many other areas of Tokyo from now on,’ he said. At Japan’s National Institute for Environmental Studies, Dr Koichi Goka admitted that the Japanese medical system was not prepared for the spider’s spread. ‘The medical system is behind,’ he told the Australian broadcaster. ‘They have anti-venom in Osaka and Fukuoka but other provinces don’t have supplies. So it’s a serious issue and hasn’t been addressed.’ Redbacks are potentially fatal for small children, a fact Australians are taught at a young age. As Japan slowly becomes aware of the dangers of the bright-red spider, a school education programme has started in schools to ensure that children don’t make the fatal mistake of picking them up. The programme warns youngsters that if they see small spiders ‘with a pretty red back, don’t touch them.’ It was in 1995 that the spider was first detected in Japan, in the city of Osaka, possibly arriving on a ship carrying fruit or wooden products from Australia. Since then, they have spread to other parts of the country so that their numbers are estimated to be in the many thousands. They do not have any natural enemies, they have ample food - and they have those warm toilets and other efficient heating systems to see them through the winter. The redbacks are reported to have bitten about 100 people in Japan. but so far there have been no fatalities. But experts fear that with their numbers growing - and relatively little anti-venom available - the risks of a fatality are increasing.","Although a native of Australia, the dangerous spider is believed to have made its way to Japan on cargo ship in the 1990s .

"Amanda Knox's one-time boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito wishes he'd never laid eyes on the American brunette, he has admitted. Six years after the murder of Knox's roommate, British exchange student Meredith Kercher, the Italian he says his life is hell because of his short-lived romance with Knox. As he prepares to face trial for Kercher's 2007 murder in Perugia, Italy, for a second time, Sellecito said he doesn't blame her - but still wishes the two had never been together, so he could have been spared the ordeal. When CNN's Piers Morgan, left, asked Raffaele Sollecito whether he wishes he never met Amanda Knox, he replied 'Yes' Kiss seen round the world: This image of Knox and Sollecito kissing just hours after Meredith Kercher's murder, turned the case into an international sensation . 'My life is a hell, but it's not Amanda's fault, this situation,' Sollecito told CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight on Wednesday. Instead, he said, he was falsely convicted the first time and must face trial against because of 'a prosecution that didn't want to admit its faults.' Sollecito and Knox, who had met only seven days prior, scandalized the world when they were filmed by an Italian news crew kissing and embracing each other, hours after Kercher was brutally murdered. British foreign exchange student Meredith Kercher was slaughtered in her apartment in Perugia, Italy, in 2007 . Morgan asked the 29-year-old: 'Do you wish with hindsight that you'd never laid eyes on her, that you'd never become embroiled in such a lurid crime scandal as this has become?' Sollecito responded: 'Yes... well basically, nobody would ever stay in a situation like mine.' Despite the admission, Sollecito doesn't harbor any ill will toward Knox. It has been reported that they met at a New York hotel in March after an Italian court overturned their acquittals. Both have since moved on, Knox has a . boyfriend in her hometown of Seattle and Sollecito has posted pictures . of himself with a new girlfriend, as well. In October 2011, the two were freed after a court ruled that the two had been convicted based on faulty evidence. Prosecutors said they now plan to introduce DNA evidence they say was found on a knife at Sollecito's apartment. Sollecito . said the introduction of the blade was 'ridiculous' and said it had . been contaminated by poor police handling - along with much of the other . evidence. He said he feels badly for Kercher's family, but that her murder should mean he and Amanda should have to suffer. 'What . I really want is we don't need this tragedy moer victims.

"The doctor believed to have been in attendance during the deadly throat biopsy that led to comedienne Joan Rivers death, appeared in  Celine Dion's 2010 documentary 'Through the Eyes of the World'. In the clip, Dr Gwen Korovin conducts an laryngoscopy on the Canadian singer, using a camera to examine Dion's vocal chords as she sings a few notes. The two go on to share a few laughs in Dr Korovin's clinic room, covered with framed photos of her famous clientele. Scroll down for video . Famous clientele: Dr Gwen Korovin, who was in the room when Joan Rivers underwent her fatal throat biopsy, appeared in a 2010 Celine Dion documentary . In the clip, Dr Korovin performs a laryngoscopy on the Canadian singer and they talk about her resting her vocal chords more . The revelation of Dr Korovin's appearance in the film comes as Joan Rivers' daughter Melissa returned to Twitter for the first time since her mother's death. 'As my son Cooper and I mourn the loss of my mother, we want to thank everyone for the beautiful cards and flowers conveying heartfelt messages and condolences, which continue to arrive from around the world and through social media. My mother would have been overwhelmed by the scope and depth of the love that people have expressed for her. It is certainly helping to lift our spirits during this time,' the 46-year-old wrote. She added: 'We are forever grateful for your kindness and support in continuing to honor my mother’s legacy, and for remembering the joy and laughter that she brought to so many.' Tragic: Comedienne Joan Rivers died on September 4 aged 81 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after undergoing a throat procedure . Dr Korovin, 56, is known as a 'throat specialist to the stars, and was in attendance during the procedure that led to Joan Rivers' death, MailOnline has learned. The doctor, who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist based in Manhattan. It is believed that Dr Korovin was at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 as Joan’s personal doctor  when the legendary comedienne stopped breathing while undergoing a procedure on her vocal cords. Today, a member of staff at Dr Korovin’s offices on East 77th Street told MailOnline: ‘We’re not commenting at this time due to the professional duty we have to our patients.’ In attendance: Dr Gwen Korovin, known as the throat specialist to the stars, is believed to have been in the room when Joan Rivers was having a throat procedure that saw her stop breathing and lead to cardiac arrest . Stars: Dr Korovin - pictured at her Manhattan home at the weekend - counts celebrities including Hugh Jackman - who performed at Joan Rivers' funeral,  Daniel Radcliffe, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande among her famous patients . Pictured at the weekend, Dr Korovin arrived back at her Manhattan home after calling ahead to inquire whether any media was waiting for her, sources said. CNN reports that a source close to the investigation into Joan's death being carried out by the New York State Department of Health said the star suffered a cardiac arrest as her personal doctor performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. A staff member at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor  even took a 'selfie' photo in the procedure room while Joan was under anesthesia, the source said. Joan, 81, arrived at the Upper East side clinic for an endoscopy with gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, on the morning on August 28. The procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. An ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - then performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords. The doctor was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist. CNN said that investigators believe that Joan's vocal chords began to swell during the  biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest. The comedienne was rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital from the clinic. However, she never regained consciousness and died on September 4 after being taken off life support and spending her final days with her daughter Melissa Rivers by her side and her loved ones paying their final respects. On Friday, Dr Cohen stepped down from his position at the medical center. A Yorkville spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline: 'Dr Cohen is not currently performing procedures at Yorkville Endoscopy; nor is he currently serving as medical director.’ Sources told ABC news that Dr Cohen had allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the clinic, to examine Joan. Neither Dr Cohen nor the specialist have been accused of wrongdoing. Today, the New York State Department of Health, in a statement to People, said: 'The State Department of  Health's investigation is ongoing. As this is an open investigation, DOH cannot comment on any specifics regarding the investigation.' The New York Times said that Joan went to a clinic for the procedure rather than a hospital to avoid publicity. One member of staff at the clinic actually assumed that Joan's personal doctor was actually her make-up artist, The Times said, adding: ‘When the E.N.T. arrived, she was identified as an observer, not a doctor. She carried a bag, according to one of the people briefed, and the clinic staff members who saw her entering the operating room assumed that she was a makeup artist there to help make Ms. Rivers look her best after the operation.’ On call: Dr Korovin told how she always totes a black bag to see her patients. She has refused to comment so far on the death of Joan Rivers . In a Wag magazine article published last year, Dr Korovin told how she rushes to see her celebrity clients with her bag in hand, saying: ‘The black bag I bring to their dressing rooms has everything I need to administer on-the-spot treatment. If needed, I will see them later in my office.' Pictures posted on her Facebook page show Dr Korovin posing by pictures of her famous patients including Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe in her Upper East side office. While not yet making any comment on the death of Joan Rivers, Dr Korovin has only ever been acclaimed by her famous patients. She has told how she does not like to resort to any rash action, saying: ‘ Patients come to me with a range of complaints and I treat them all, including performing surgery when needed – like the removal of polyps and cysts – and treating upper respiratory problems and cleaning out sinuses. 'I like to be conservative and go as far as possible with medical treatment before doing surgery.'# . Stage star Nathan Lane credits her with helping him through previews of “The Nance” last year. “I was fighting a bronchial infection. I don’t think I would have made it through opening night without her.” Dr Korovin also counts Hugh Jackman as one of her high-profile patients. The Australian star brought down the house as he performed Quiet Please, There’s a Lady on Stage, from the musical, The Boy From Oz, at Joan’s funeral in New York. Gone: Gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, the medical director of Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic, stepped down from his position on Friday. He carried out an endoscopy on Joan Rivers on August 28. It was later reported he had allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the clinic, to examine the star . Clinic: Friends said that Joan Rivers wanted to go to Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic on Manhattan's Upper East Side, pictured, to have her throat procedure because going to a hospital would have brought more publicity . In a 2013 interview with the Daily News, Dr Korovin was hailed as ‘Broadway’s throat doc’ and the ‘keeper of high profile pipes’. Indeed, in 1998 Celine Dion even thanked the specialist when she won a Grammy. The profile says:‘The walls in the ear, nose and throat doctor’s upper East Side office are lined with pictures and thank-you notes from stars who’ve opened wide and said ahh: Hugh Jackman, Kristin Chenoweth, Julie Andrews, Barbara Cook and Brooke Shields, to name a few.’ Celebrities: Dr Gwen Korovin counts former View co-host Joy Behar among her patients . Celeb doctor: Pop princess Ariana Grande posted a picture of Dr Korovin giving her a B12 shot in her bottom before an appearance with Jimmy Fallon . She also helped singer John Mayer through his recent vocal-cord issue. 'We’re friendly,' said Dr Korovin when asked if Mayer was up to his flirty ways in her office. 'There’s a mutual respect. You get to know your patients very well.' Staying quiet: Both Dr Gwen Korovin and her husband, attorney Jack Uram, have refused to comment on the death of Joan Rivers. The couple are pictured together in New York in 2005 . That includes Lady Gaga, whose mother referred her to Dr Korovin.  And despite Gaga’s eccentric behaviour and get-up, her vocal cords ‘are just like everyone else's', says the doctor. Despite this, the profile added that not all of Dr Korovin’s patients are stars and Broadway legends, saying 'She treats upper East Side society types and more average New Yorkers.' Tribute: The incredible Hugh Jackman brought down the house at Joan Rivers' funeral at Temple Emanu-El on Sunday, September 7, as he performed a song from his show, The Boy From Oz, He's seen arriving by bike for the service in Manhattan . High-profile: Dr Korovin has treated singer John Mayer - whose vocal cords were damaged by a growth - and Lady Gaga . In Wag magazine, Dr Kerovin told how she often interrupts weekends at her country home in Westchester to help high-profile performers between matinee and evening performances. She is also pictured treating pop sensation Ariana Grande with a vitamin B12 shot before an appearance with Jimmy Fallon - a photo which Ariana posted to her Instagram account.. 'I treat patients backstage many times a year,' she said. Meanwhile, a source told MailOnline that Melissa is still 'very raw' and has not yet thought about launching legal action against Yorkville or Joan's personal doctor, saying: 'I was told that the family was not going to do anything, but that was a few days ago, so who knows what will happen.' Neither Dr Korovin or her attorney husband Jack Uram returned telephone messages.","Dr Gwen Korovin appeared in Celine Dion's 2010 film 'Through the Eyes of the World' and was filmed performing a laryngoscopy on the singer .

"If you have always found doing sums a struggle, you might just be able to blame your mother. Because research has linked a woman’s hormone levels in pregnancy with her child’s maths skills at age five. Boys and girls whose mothers were very low in the hormone thyroxine were almost twice as likely to do badly in arithmetic tests, it found. Thyroxine, which passes from mother to baby in the womb, is crucial for the development of the brain – but many expectant mothers have too little of it . Thyroxine, which passes from mother to baby in the womb, is crucial for the development of the brain – but many expectant mothers have too little of it. Researcher Martijn Finken studied almost 1,200 children from when they were in the womb until they started school. He measured their mothers’ thyroxine levels 12 weeks into pregnancy and compared the results with the children’s scores in arithmetic and language tests at age five. Those who were exposed to the lowest levels of thyroxine in the womb were 90 per cent more likely to end up in the bottom half of the class for maths. Those who were exposed to the lowest levels of thyroxine in the womb were 90 per cent more likely to end up in the bottom half of the class for maths . This was true even after taking into account the child’s family background and health at birth. Interestingly, hormone levels were not linked to the children’s scores on tests of vocabulary and ability with language. Dr Finken said this may be because our language skills owe a lot to our upbringing. Our maths ability, on the other hand, can be traced more directly back to brain development. The researcher, a paediatric endocrinologist from the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, will continue to track the children’s progress as they go through their school years. Dr Finken said: ‘Whether these problems persist into adulthood remains to be seen. We will continue to follow these children to answer this next big question.’ He added that it may be possible to deal with the problem simply by testing women’s hormones early in pregnancy and giving thyroxine supplements to those who need them. Doctors have tried this in the past with little success, but Dr Finken believes that is because the supplements were not given early enough. Women should take the tablets in the first four weeks of pregnancy, he said. British expert Professor John Lazarus explained that during early pregnancy, an unborn baby is not yet able to produce its own thyroxine. This leaves it dependent on the mother’s supply – but studies suggest that up to two-thirds of mothers-to-be in Britain are low in the hormone. Professor Lazarus, who is a former trustee of the British Thyroid Foundation, put the widespread problem down to a lack of iodine in the diet. Iodine, which is found in milk and fish, is the main ingredient of thyroxine. He suggested that iodine should be added to salt to boost people’s consumption – a move that has been taken in many other countries. The professor, who is chairman of the UK Iodine Group, advises women to take iodine during pregnancy. However, it is not currently on the list of supplements the NHS recommends for mothers-to-be. Professor Lazarus said it is safe for pregnant women to take 100 to 150 micrograms a day. British doctors have previously warned that many teenage girls are dangerously low on iodine – putting the health of their future children at risk. A 2011 study of 700 schoolgirls revealed almost 70 per cent were deficient in the mineral. Researchers said young girls are not drinking enough milk. The NHS says most people should get all the iodine they need by eating a varied diet.","Children whose mothers had low thyroxine hormone levels twice as likely to do badly in arithmetic .

"London Mayor Boris Johnson mocked the government plan to screen passengers arriving form Ebola-hit countries . Boris Johnson today ridiculed the government's attempts to tackle the spread of Ebola, accusing Number 10 of making promises which 'don't really make any sense'. The London Mayor said he could understand why the public was left baffled by the Downing Street announcement of plans to quiz air passengers arriving from West Africa in an attempt to prevent the deadly virus entering the UK. Mr Johnson warned that 'eventually' there would be a case of Ebola in Britain, 'probably' in London, but the focus should be on preparing for it not making announcements about screening which does not work. There is a growing sense of chaos surrounding government plans to screen passengers, with airlines insisting they are in the dark about how it will work in practice to halt the spread of the virus which has so far killed more than 4,000 people. With the incubation period for the disease as long as 21 days, it is feared the delay in introducing measures could mean the deadly virus is already in the UK. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is expected to use a Commons statement tomorrow to set out the timescale and details of the screening plan in the UK. It is expected to start by Tuesday or Wednesday, in line with how long it took the US to introduce its own screening programme last week. On Thursday morning the British government ruled out screening passengers, with Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warning it would be 'very hard' to track people arriving in the UK from affected countries. But eight hours later Number 10 announced 'enhanced screening' will be carried out at Heathrow and Gatwick, and Eurostar trains, for people arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. But far from reassuring voters, the lack of detail about the plans have added to the sense of confusion. Mr Johnson told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'I understand why people don't understand them. The difficulty is I think again it's one of those cases where we are at risk of seeming to promise stuff that doesn't really make any sense. 'You can't blood test everybody coming in to the country.' There are no direct flights between Britain and the high risk areas, but it is possible to change in a third country. Airport screening of people leaving airports in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea has been in place for several weeks. But following calls for checks on arrival in the UK, the government suddenly changed its position on screening. A Downing Street source said today: 'It is important to stress that the decision to bring forward that additional screening was taken with the advice of the chief medical officer. 'We are absolutely upfront about saying there is no magic solution for protecting the UK from this. This is another layer to try to help.' Medical teams at New York's JFK airport, armed with Ebola questionnaires and temperature guns, began screening travellers from three West African countries yesterday. John F. Kennedy Airport is the first of five U.S. airports to start enhanced screening of U.S.-bound travellers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Medical teams at New York's JFK airport, armed with Ebola questionnaires and temperature guns, began screening travelers from three West African countries yesterday . 9.30am Defence Secretary Michael Fallon: . 'We're following the advice of the World Health Organisation, and the advice here of the Chief Medical Officer, and the WHO advice is that it is better to screen on exit from a country to make sure people who are leaving are not infected, rather than trying to screen people who arrive. It's very hard to be able to track people who are changing planes and arriving by different means in the UK.' 2pm Chancellor George Osborne: . 'If the medical advice is we need to screen - it might well be - then we will absolutely take that action. We are not going to do anything that puts the British population at risk. Quite the opposite. The steps we have taken for several months now have all been designed to protect Britain from this awful disease. 5.30pm Downing Street: . 'Advice from the Chief Medical Officer today is that enhanced screening arrangements at the UK's main ports of entry for people travelling from the affected regions - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - will offer an additional level of protection to the UK.' But Mr Johnson insisted: 'I can only go on the advice I have been given and that is that although I think we are doing a lot more screening, we don't think that temperature measures alone will be of any use. 'Because you could after all be in the early stages of incubation of the virus and have two or three weeks to run. 'So the idea of screening at airports is far from perfect as a solution.' He stressed the focus should be on screening and testing people 'people coming from the affected countries'. He added: 'They shouldn't be allowed to leave if they have been in contact with people in one of the affected areas. 'And obviously we should be putting on preparations in this country. I have little doubt that eventually there will be a case of Ebola in this country and probably in this city. 'We have fantastic preparations in London for this, we have very good healthcare in this city, considerably better, alas, obviously than they have alas in Africa.' Labour's shadow health minister Luciana Berger said: 'People don't want to see politicians on TV speculating about an Ebola outbreak, before passing the buck. 'After the past week they want reassurance that robust preparations are being made. Boris Johnson should focus on explaining what plans are in place.' Airports, airlines and Eurostar have all said they are still waiting for instructions from the government about how its hastily-announced plans would be implemented in practice. Public Health England, the Government body which had previously said screening would not be effective, is now in charge of the programme but said it had no more details of how it would work. Meanwhile the British expert in charge of the United Nations response to Ebola has said he hopes the spread of the killer virus will be 'under control' in three months. Dr David Nabarro, the UN's special envoy on Ebola, said the number of cases in west African countries including Sierra Leone were increasing week-on-week. But systems now put in place, along with international help from nations including Britain, could help turn the tide and reduce the number of cases from one week to the next, he told the BBC 5live Up All Night's Dotun Adebayo. Staff from North East Ambulance Service and the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle took part in an exercise on Saturday aimed at showing the NHS could cope with an Ebola outbreak if and when it reaches the UK . Mr Johnson insisted the NHS was well-prepared for the deadly virus and was better equipped than the African nations which are worst affected . However Dr Nabarro said screening people arriving at ports and airports was 'less necessary' than screening on departure and singling out people because of their nationality or where they are travelling from was 'inappropriate'. He added: 'As a result of the sensitisation programme last month I think we have got a much better community involvement, which leads me to believe that getting it under control within the next three months is a reasonable target. 'When we have a disease outbreak like this there is a thing called the epidemic curve, which is numbers of cases over time, and at the moment that epidemic curve is increasing in an exponential fashion ... this means an upward-going curve and it's quite frightening because it means an acceleration. 'By under control I mean we bend the curve down, the numbers of cases each week diminishes compared with the previous week to the point where there is no new transmissions. For me under control means the epidemic curve is coming down and we are confident that the numbers of cases is reducing and will be eventually ended.'","London Mayor mocks plans for screening announced by the government .

"A tech pioneer once worth up to $1 billion is selling off his sprawling Los Angeles mansion for a fraction of what he paid, three months after he filed chapter 7 bankruptcy. Halsey Minor, 48, founded CNET, a TV network and web brand focused on software and technology, in 1994 and despite flogging it for nearly $2 billion in 2008, he wound up broke after years of ill-fated investments. Now, he's having to sell his opulent, but rundown 7,479-square-foot mansion in Bel Air, which is touted as having the 'mother of all views' that stretch unobstructed from the city to the ocean. For sale: Halsey Minor is having to sell his opulent, but rundown 7,479-square-foot mansion in Bel Air, pictured . Broke: Minor, 48, founded CNET, a TV network and web brand focused on software and technology, in 1994 and despite flogging it for nearly $2 billion in 2008, he wound up broke . The home has hit the market for $14,950,000 as a bankruptcy sale - about $5 million less than the $20 million price Minor paid for it in 2006. According to property records, he tried to sell the home for even less - just $8,995,000 - in 2010 but it didn't attract a buyer. The four bedroom, six full bathroom property is located in lower Bel Air in a gated estate that sits on a cliff. It was originally designed by famed Mid-Century architect Richard Dorman and built in 1964. But, according to the listing it requires a serious overhaul before it's move in ready.

However, the home, modeled after Marie Antoinette's Le Petit Trianon in Versailles, is similarly in disrepair. The tech pioneer filed chapter 7 bankruptcy in May after dabbling in investments outside the realm of the internet. Minor, from Charlottesville, Virginia, founded CNET in 1994 and sold the network to CBS in 2008 for a reported $1.8 billion. The tech entrepreneur had other successes as well. He was an early investor in the now-profitable OpenDNS. He also Pumped $6 million into a voice over internet startup called Grand Central that would later be purchased by Google, and turned into Google Voice, for $50 million in 2007. Le mistake: Also in 2007, Minor bought a replica of a Versailles palace living quarters in San Francisco for $22 million. That property is now for sale for $21 million . Wasted space: Le Petit Trianon was never occupied by Minor and, like the Virginia estate, fell into disrepair. Skateboarders were found using its staircases as ramps . Abandoned: The city deemed the home 'abandoned' in 2011 and it was placed at auction but didn't sell . Bankrupt: The tech pioneer filed chapter 7 bankruptcy in May after dabbling in investments outside the realm of the internet . An early investment in Salesforce.com, a company that provides cloud computing solutions, proved fruitful after the company—now worth $25 billion—went public, earning Minor hundreds of millions. And the master of the tech investment didn't stop investing there. He began investing in things outside his realm of expertise, a decision that prove to be his downfall. In 2006, Minor lost $50 million in a divorce settlement with wife Deborah. The following year, 2007, the investor made several purchases he'd later live to regret. In . his native Charlottesville, Minor became a major investor through his . company Minor Family Hotels, in the ultimately failed development of the . downtown Landmark Hotel project. Halsey Minor made hundreds of millions from his tech investments beginning in the early 1990s. But his trouble began after he began trying his hand at investing outside the dotcom world: . Los Angeles Mansion: On market for $14.9 million after he paid $20 million for the property in 2006 . Charlottesville Landmark Hotel: High hopes couldn't save this 2007 hotel project. It would eventually be wrenched from him after standing unfinished for years. A judge later ruled that Minor owed investment firm $21.6 million according to court filings . Carter's Grove Estate: Minor bought the historic James River Estate for $35 million in 2007. It subsequently stood empty and in disrepair for years until preservationists successfully got the crumbling mansion placed at auction in 2013. Le Petit Trianon: A replica of living quarters at the palace of Versailles in France, Minor also bought the $21 million San Francisco mansion in 2007, but neither he nor his family ever occupied it. Reports say the city deemed the property 'abandoned' in 2011 and placed it up for auction at $25 million . Sotheby's: Minor also fancied fine art, it seems, as the Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses took action against him in 2007, claiming he failed to make good on winning bids on several high-end paintings, including: Edward Hick's 'Peaceable Kingdom,' Hassam's 'Paris, Winter Day' and Warhol's 'Diamond Dust Shoes' The nine-story building, designed to have 100 rooms, sat empty and unfinished for years after its initial construction. Taxes and fines accrued as what was once a symbol of optimism in downtown Charlottesville remained just a sad skeleton. The unfinished hotel was finally auctioned off last year for $6.25 million, though it continues to sit untouched and a scourge to the community, waiting for its new owners to resume construction. Also in Virginia, an equally contentiousness investment by Minor sits along the James River. The historic Carter's Grove estate, completed in 1755 is referred by the National Parks Service as 'one of colonial America’s most impressive examples of Georgian architecture.' Minor struck a deal for the home he reportedly said 'I have no use for' in 2007. But, by 2011, he'd missed two payments on the estate and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Meanwhile, preservationist became increasingly agitated by what they called Minor's neglect of the estate as it began to fall into disrepair due to lack of upkeep. Over in San Francisco, Minor's 2007 $22 million purchase of a replica Versailles mansion in the city's posh Presidio Heights also ended in heartache. Minor had big intentions of restoring the local and national landmark to its original grandeur, but the proposed $15 million revamp never came to be. The city of San Francisco would site the 22-room building as abandoned, due to its state of disrepair, by 2011. That same year, the mansion that . Minor at no point occupied, would be put up for auction at $25 million. But it didn't sell and the eight bedroom seven bathroom mansion is again . on the market for $21 million. After his 2011 bankruptcy claim, Minor's assets were frozen. Carter's . Grove was offered as security to Sotheby's, to which he owned several . million more for well-known fine art pieces he'd neglected to fully pay . for after winning them at auction. Specifically, . Edward Hicks 'Peaceable Kingdom with the Leopard of Serenity,' Childe . Hassam's 'Paris, Winter Day,' and Andy Warhol's 'Diamond Dust Shoes.' Artless: Minor purchased Edward Hicks 'The Peaceable Kingdom with the Leopard of Serenity' at auction, along with two other pieces, that he reported never paid for and auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's then sued . Diamond-eyed: Minor initially bid for and won Warhol's 'Diamond Dust Shoes' from Sotheby's auction house but later backed out and Sotheby's sued . Dismal days: Minor also refused to pay for Hassam's 'Paris, Winter Day' Minor has since filed Chapter 7 . bankruptcy and cites liabilities of $50 million to $100 million to 60 . creditors, while claiming personal assets of between $10 million and $50 . million. 'I love being an entrepreneur even though it involves financial risk,' Minor wrote in a letter to the Wall Street Journal. 'I have been fortunate enough to play a meaningful role in building . great companies like CNET Networks, Salesforce.com, Rhapsody, NBCi, the . service known as Google Voice and others. But if you win some you are . going to lose some too.' The . Wall Street Journal reports Minor’s creditors include Allied Waste . Services, Allied Waste Services, AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Bank of . America Home Loans, the California Department of Motor Vehicles, . Dominion Virginia Power, the Internal Revenue Service, tax collector . offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco, various law firms and UCLA . Medical Center, among others. A trustee will now be appointed to Minor to liquidate his remaining assets in order to repay his many creditors. Liquidated: Minor filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May, the most common type of personal bankruptcy. His assets, said to range between $50 million and $100 million have and continue to be liquidated and used to pay Minor's long list of creditors . Unfinished business: Minor's planned Charlottesville, Virginia Landmark Hotel, was hatched in 2007 but sat empty at 2008, unfinished and skeletal until Minor and his investors were forced to abandon the project . Damaged goods: Minor purchased a James River plantation, Carter Grove, for $13.7 million, just before his assets were frozen from a 2011 bankruptcy. The historic property quickly fell into disrepair .","Halsey Minor's Los Angeles mansion is up for sale for $14.9 million .

"Putting up a fight: Mr Salmond, pictured at the Ryder Cup handover during the trip, defended its cost . Alex Salmond yesterday dismissed criticism of a taxpayer-funded £51,000 trip to a five-star hotel in America as 'ridiculous frippery'. The Scottish First Minister confirmed that he stayed in the luxury Peninsula Hotel in Chicago during a trip to the Ryder Cup last year. It is one of the of the most exclusive hotels in the city and Mr Salmond has come under-fire for the stay which came during the official handover ceremony of the trophy. Golf fan Mr Salmond and his wife Moira were accompanied by Sports Minister Shona Robison, a team of 12 government officials and 22 workers from publicly funded agencies. But while in Chicago, the SNP leader stayed for a few nights at the luxury hotel, which is popular with Hollywood stars including Brad Pitt, Beyonce, Jennifer Aniston and Eva Longoria, while most officials checked in elsewhere. Labour leader Johann Lamont yesterday demanded to know why he had chosen to stay at the £1,205 a night hotel and not the cheaper one with others in the delegation. But Mr Salmond sparked anger when he dismissed the calls as 'ridiculous frippery'. Miss Lamont said: 'The First Minister has to explain where he spent that money, because he should understand in the real world the people of Scotland will be disgusted at how the First Minister treats himself at their expense. 'Can he now have at least the decency of explaining to them how he spent, in just one week, the taxpayers’ money which he still hasn’t accounted for.” But Mr Salmond replied: 'There were, in my memory, 17 people in the Scottish Government delegation. That is the expenditure in terms of the flights and accommodation for 17 people.' 'The visit was not just about the two days of the Ryder Cup. The visit stretched over the range of events in Chicago to attract investment to Scotland. Luxury: The First Minister stayed at the five-star Peninsula Hotel in Chicago, pictured . Pricey: Located in East Superior Street, the hotel features a spa and a swimming pool . 'The investment to Scotland that was announced in that trip was worth tens of millions of pounds and brought jobs to many areas of Scotland. 'All that justifies a substantial effort to promote this country and this ridiculous frippery we get from Johann Lamont'. The First Minister and his entourage spent almost half-a-million pounds of taxpayers’ money to go to the Ryder Cup. The £468,581 ‘Team Scotland’ bill included £80,264 on accommodation and £54,192 for flights. The true cost to taxpayers will be even higher, as Perth and Kinross Council and Tayside Police also sent representatives to Chicago. The week-long trip in September was to celebrate the hand-over of the Ryder Cup to Scotland, which is hosting the event at Gleneagles in 2014. A breakdown of the bill shows £82,165 was spent on an exhibition stand, office costs reached £20,178 and ‘programme delivery’ spending was £202,600. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont: 'In just a week he spent more than twice what the average Scot earns in a year'. She added government officials were staying in a different, less opulent hotel . But there remains around £54,000 unaccounted for after VisitScotland revealed its part of the cost in a detailed reply last year. The Scottish Government has yet to publish details of Mr Salmond’s bill and had not confirmed the luxury hotel stay until yesterday. Miss Lamont condemned the Government for having 'failed to account' for more than £50,000 of spending on the Chicago visit, which cost almost £470,000 in total. Stylish: Mr Salmond defended the trip to the hotel, pictured, for the handover of the Ryder Cup . She said the Peninsula Hotel was described as being 'for those who love to spoil themselves with a luxurious five-star experience without losing that comfortable home away from home feeling'. She added: 'For the First Minister to dismiss questions about how he spent £54,000 on a trip to the golf as ""ridiculous frippery"" shows just how out of touch Alex Salmond is with the real lives of the people of Scotland. 'In just a week he spent more than twice what the average Scot earns in a year. 'He cannot tell us why he chose to stay in a five star luxury hotel at the taxpayers’ expense in Chicago rather than the one Scottish government officials were staying in. 'Alex Salmond cannot account for how thousands of pounds of public money was spent. 'The people of Scotland won’t see asking him to account as ""ridiculous frippery"" – but they will fear that thousands of their money was spent by Alex Salmond on ridiculous fripperies.' But a spokesman for the First Minister said costs for the delegation made up of the First Minister and 17 others - was around £51,000 for the Chicago visit. He added that included £13,500 for accommodation and £37,500 on travel expenses. The spokesman said: 'There was a Ryder Cup component (to the visit) where they were at the golf itself, but also a very strong business component to the visit. 'There were various business meetings which were held at the Peninsula Hotel and there was a block booking made at the Peninsula in order to get best value for that. 'He stayed there some of the time when he was in Chicago for the business meetings, but when he was attending the golf at the Ryder Cup itself he was staying at a different hotel, which was the same hotel everyone stayed at for the golf at Medina.'","Mr Salmond was at Peninsula Hotel, Chicago, for Ryder Cup handover .

"It was the boredom of marking exams that led him to write his acclaimed first novel The Hobbit. And, a newly uncovered letter reveals, this wandering mind was a life-long affliction for Professor John Tolkien – and not one he was proud of. In the letter, which goes up for auction at Bonhams on Wednesday, the academic, who held professorships in both Anglo-Saxon and English Language and Literature at Oxford University, laments his early days as an inattentive pupil. He wrote: ‘I wish I could now tell some . of [my teachers] (of long ago) how I remember them and things they said, . though I was (only, as it appeared) looking out of the window or . giggling at my neighbour.’ Artefact: A letter written by Lord of the Rings author JRR Tolkien deriding teaching has emerged for sale - telling a newly-qualified teacher it is 'exhausting and depressing' Admission: Tolkien replied to a teacher from London who read her class The Hobbit to keep them calm . The half-typed, half-handwritten note – which is expected to fetch between £1,500 and £2,000 at auction – was a reply to Anne Mountfield, at newly qualified teacher at Eltham Green School in London, who had read The Hobbit to calm her usually restless class. One of her pupils was so moved by the book they penned a note to the author which Mrs Mountfield dutifully forwarded on. In his response, Professor Tolkien complimented the student, saying he received many such letters but ‘few as well penned as this’. However, under the official typed reply, the academic handwrote an aside for Mrs Mountfield, where he expressed his dissatisfaction with their shared profession, describing teaching as ‘exhausting and depressing’ and complained that ‘one is seldom comforted by knowing when one has had some effect’. Correspondence: Tolkien's reply was to Anne Mountfield, at newly qualified teacher at Eltham Green School in London (pictured) Professor Tolkien, most famous for writing The Lord of the Rings trilogy, was marking undergraduate work when he allowed his mind to wander and scribbled on the back of one paper: ‘In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit’. This nonsense sentence went on to become the first words of The Hobbit and launched one of the twentieth century’s most successful literary careers. Since first being published in 1937, the children’s novel has sold more than 100 million copies. After receiving the letter, Mrs Mountfield filed it away and promptly forgot all about it before rediscovering it last year. She had been sent a note from a former pupil thanking her for being such an influence on her early lives and then, just days later, she stumbled across Professor Tolkien’s note and his thoughts on teaching. She put the coincidence down to ‘a little Gandalf magic’ and said: ‘How right Tolkien was that teachers are seldom “comforted by knowing that one has had some effect” and how very nice when, 50 years after the event, it happens.’","Note sent to London teacher who read Hobbit to her class to calm them .

"An elderly man in Sparks, Nevada was arrested Tuesday, three months after he shot dead an unarmed squatter in his home. Wayne Burgarello was charged with murder and attempted murder for killing father-of-two Cody Devine, 34, and seriously injuring 29-year-old Janai Wilson. The 73-year-old claims he only shot the two squatters in self-defense, according to a police affidavit obtained by the Reno Gazette-Journal. The victim's father Richard Devine told MailOnline that he plans to attend Burgarello's trial and believes 'justice will be served'. Arrested: Wayne Burgarello, 73 (left), was arrested Tuesday on charges of murder and attempted murder after shooting dead 34-year-old Cody Devine (right) at his vacant property this past February. Devine's friend Janai Wilson, 29, had been squatting on the property for the past three years, and was also injured in the attack . According to Wilson, she and Devine took methamphetamine the morning of February 13 before Devine drove her to Burgarello's home - an abandoned property that Wilson had been illegally squatting at off an don for the past three years. Both entered the home and fell asleep before a neighbor reported their break in. Alvin Lilla, a renter at an adjoining property, called Burgarello and said he believed squatters were inside the home since a Toyota 4Runner was parked outside. Burgarello arrived at the home armed with three handguns, and entered the building with two pistols drawn in each hand. Vacant: Burgarello showed up armed with three handguns after a neighbor notified him that squatters had broke in . Abandoned: The property is surrounded in overgrown shrubbery in this satellite view from 2011 . Lilla followed 12 feet behind and says he was warned to stay quiet. 'Shh, don't make any noise,' Burgarello ordered him, according to the affidavit. 'If anybody's in here I'm the owner, you better not be in here, this is a private property, and nobody better be in here!' Burgarello then said. Burgarello came across Devine and Wilson sleeping in a dark bedroom where the window was covered with a blanket. The two woke up and Wilson says Devine yelled 'We are just sleeping' before they were shot. Aftermath: Police are seen responding to the scene back in February . Burgarello says he fired because he saw Devine's arm rise and believed he was holidng his own gun. Both Wilson and Devine were unarmed. 'I think I said, ""Who are you? What are you doing here?""' Burgarello told police. 'I don't know if I said anything or not. The arm came up like a gun, and I reacted.' Lilla told police he heard 'numerous gunshots, a pause, and then a final gunshot.' Devine was pronounced dead at the scene after being hit with five shots, including a blow to his head. Wilson was shot in the arm, stomach and leg but was able to flee the property, jumping a fence and run for a block and a half. She survived the incident after she was rushed to the hospital. Though Burgarello admitted to shooting the two squatters, he wasn't arrested until Tuesday because it 'took a while' for authorities to compile evidence. Long time coming: It took police three months to arrest Burgarello because it 'took a while' to compile the evidence. Sparks Police Department Sgt Aaron Leary announced the arrest in a Tuesday press conference . He was arrested during a traffic stop, and is being held without bail at the Washoe County Jail. The victim's father Richard Devine spoke with MailOnline and revealed what his son's life was like before his untimely death. Mr Devine says his son was living with him at the time and helping re-tile his home and install a new roof. Cody had plans to leave the day after he was murdered to visit his two young children in Phoenix, Arizona. Mr Devine believes one of his grandkids is in grade school, and that Cody was divorced from the mother. The two were on good terms, he says. As for Burgarello, Mr Devine believes 'justice will be served' when he goes to trial, and he plans to attend the hearings. He believes Burgarello should have called police, instead of coming into the home armed, but he doesn't have a strong opinion on gun control laws. 'Bad guys are gonna get guns' he said.","Wayne Burgarello shot and killed Cody Devine last February after discovering the 34-year-old and a woman sleeping in his vacant home .

"A Florida doctor whose close relationship with New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez is under investigation by federal prosecutors bills the most for Medicare in the country - and was paid a staggering $20.8 million by the program in 2012. Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, whose offices were raided twice by the FBI last year, received the biggest sum from Medicare, a study of physician data has revealed. He was among a tiny group of doctors -  344 physicians out of more than 825,000 - who were paid $3 million or more apiece that year, totaling at nearly $1.5 billion. The eye-watering sums were revealed by an Associated Press analysis of physician data that was released on Wednesday by the Obama administration. The release was part of a move to open the books on health care financing to allow patients to make informed choices about their treatment. Top pay: Dr. Salomon Melgen tops Medicare's list of physicians from its claims database, getting $20.8 million in 2012. He is pictured at a book signing by New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez in 2010 . The second highest biller was Asad U. Qamar, a . cardiologist in Ocala, Florida, who received $18.1 million, mostly from . putting in stents. A New Jersey pathologist received $12.6 million . performing tissue exams, and a Michigan vascular surgeon took in $10.1 . million. Some of the highest . billing totals may be because a doctor has an unusually large number of . Medicare patients, but in some instances, the high totals could signal . fraudulent doctor behavior. Among doctors accused of such conduct is Detroit cancer doctor Farid Fata, the seventh highest biller among the Medicare data. He received $10 million in Medicare payments in 2012 and is now awaiting a fraud case, after he was accused of intentionally misdiagnosing illnesses and ordering treatments for people who did not have cancer. He has denied any wrongdoing. The doctor who received the highest payout from Medicare in 2012 - a staggering $20.8 million - has been a key figure in two different federal investigations. Dr Salomon Melgen, a 59-year-old ophthalmologist, had his South Florida offices raided by the FBI twice last year, in January and October. The FBI launched an investigation against him after he was accused of overbilling by taking one batch of medication and giving it to multiple patients, billing each one individually. Federal rules stated that any medication left over from a single patient was supposed to be thrown out. Melgen denied any wrongdoing but was forced to pay back $9 million he was accused of overbilling. His generous political contributions and close relationship with New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez are also under investigation by federal public corruption prosecutors. Dr Melgen, who has said the senator is 'like a brother' to him, has donated more than $700,000 to the senator's PAC. He also allowed him to use his private jet for trips to the Dominican Republic, but the senator was forced to pay back the cost of the travel. Melgen moved to Florida from the Dominican Republic in the late 1970s and lives in a 5,000 square foot home in North Palm Beach. Medicare data shows that he billed mostly for Lucentis, which is used to treat blocked blood vessels in the eye. It is made by a company that pays generous rebates to its doctors. But speaking to the New York Times, Melgen's lawyer warned against presuming that the doctor's high Medicare bills meant he was involved in fraud. Instead he insisted that the doctor has a large practice. But Dr Melgen's lawyer insisted that the physician simply led a large practice. Melgen has been a key figure in two different federal investigations. His relationship with Senator . Menendez made headlines last year after news broke that the lawmaker . used the doctor's personal jet for trips to the Dominican Republic. In addition to allowing the use . of his jet, the eye specialist was the top political donor for Menendez . as the New Jersey Democrat sought re-election to the Senate that year. Menendez's . relationship with Melgen prompted Senate Ethics and Justice Department . investigations, and Menendez reimbursed Melgen more than $70,000 for plane . trips. The issue exploded in . late January 2013, after the FBI conducted a search of Melgen's West . Palm Beach offices. Melgen said he had done nothing wrong. AP picked the $3 million threshold because that was the figure used by the Health and Human Services inspector general in an audit last year that recommended Medicare automatically scrutinize total billings above a set level. Medicare says it's working on that recommendation. About one in four of the top-paid doctors - 87 of them - practice in Florida, a state known both for high Medicare spending and widespread fraud. Rounding out the top five states were California with 38 doctors in the top group, New Jersey with 27, Texas with 23, and New York with 18. In the $3 million-plus club, 151 ophthalmologists - eye specialists - accounted for nearly $658 million in Medicare payments, leading other disciplines. Cancer doctors rounded out the top four specialty groups, accounting for a combined total of more than $477 million in payments. Overall, Medicare paid individual physicians nearly $64 billion in 2012. The median payment- the point at which half the amounts are higher and half are lower - was $30,265, a tiny fraction of what its top paid received. AP's analysis focused on individual physicians, excluding about 55,000 organizations that also appear in the database, such as ambulance services. None of those entities was paid $3 million or more. The Medicare claims database is considered the richest trove of information on doctors, surpassing what major insurance companies have in their files. Although Medicare is financed by taxpayers, the data have been off limits to the public for decades. Physician organizations went to court to block its release, arguing it would amount to an invasion of doctors' privacy. Probe: In January 2013, an FBI agent is seen carrying a box of equipment into Melgen's West Palm Beach, Florida practice after he was linked to multiple politicians through his donations . Investigation: Law enforcement officials carry boxes following a late night raid on the offices last year . Employers, insurers, consumer groups and media organizations pressed for release. Together with other sources of information, they argued that the data could help guide patients to doctors who provide quality, cost-effective care. A federal judge last year lifted the main legal obstacle to release, and the Obama administration recently informed the American Medical Association it would open up the claims data. 'It will allow us to start putting the . pieces together,' said Dianne Munevar, a top researcher at the health . care data firm Avalare Health. 'That is the basis of what payment . delivery reform is about.' Doctors' decision-making patterns are of intense interest to researchers who . study what drives the nation's $2.8-trillion-a-year health care system. Within the system, physicians act as the main representatives of . patients, and their decisions about how to treat determine spending. The . American Medical Association, which has long opposed release of the . Medicare database, is warning it will do more harm than good. The . AMA says the files may contain inaccurate information. And even if the . payment amounts are correct, the AMA says they do not provide meaningful . insights into the quality of care. Friendship: New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, pictured, used Dr Melgen's private jet and stayed at his luxury home in the Dominican Republic - but was ordered to pay back the cost of the trip . 'We believe that the broad data dump ... has significant shortcomings regarding the accuracy and value of the medical services rendered by physicians,' AMA president Ardis Dee Hoven said. 'Releasing the data without context will likely lead to inaccuracies, misinterpretations, false conclusions and other unintended consequences.' The AMA had asked the government to allow individual doctors to review their information prior to its release. Over time, as researchers learn to mine the Medicare data, it could change the way medicine is practiced in the U.S. Doctor ratings, often based on the opinions of other physicians, would be driven by hard data, like statistics on baseball players. Consumers could become better educated about the doctors in their communities. For example, if your father is about to undergo heart bypass, you could find out how many operations his surgeon has done in the last year.  Research shows that for many procedures, patients are better off going to a surgeon who performs them frequently. The data could also be used to spot fraud, such as doctors billing for seeing more patients in a day than their office could reasonably be expected to care for. Medical practice would have to change to accommodate big data. Acting as intermediaries for employers and government programs, insurers could use the Medicare numbers to demand that low-performing doctors measure up. If the data indicated a particular doctor's diabetic patients were having unusually high rates of complications, that doctor might face questions. Such oversight would probably accelerate trends toward large medical groups and doctors working as employees instead of in small practices.","Dr Saloman Melgen, whose South Florida office was raided by the FBI last year, was paid $20.8 million by Medicare in 2012 .

"The BBC is planning to charge up to £5 for its hit programmes in a challenge  to online services such as Netflix and iTunes. As part of an ambitious online revamp, the Corporation has already tested a BBC Store from which viewers will be able to buy episodes or series months or years after they are first broadcast. Hit shows including Doctor Who, Luther, Sherlock, Horrible Histories, Murphy’s Law and Sir David Attenborough’s Human Planet will be for sale when the service launches next year. iPlayer: The service will remain, but some backdated programmes could soon cost up to £5 to download . The BBC eventually hopes to offer downloads of almost every show it makes. Programmes on the free- to-use iPlayer will be also made available for 30 days instead of the current seven. One BBC source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It is a no-brainer. At the moment viewers can only buy shows on DVD in somewhere like W H Smith. ‘Luther would be offered for about 99p an episode and other series are being offered for about £5.’ The first series of the crime drama can be purchased from iTunes for £5.99 and can also be watched on Netflix – which charges subscribers £5.99 a month to stream shows over the internet. The BBC’s plans still need to be approved by its governing body, but bosses have already begun testing the idea with focus groups. Doctor Who will be included in the programmes to be charged for - which will still be cheaper than DVDs . Volunteers are being asked to study mocked-up pages from the BBC Store website, which display a particular show together with details of its price and how to buy it. A page for the crime drama Luther, starring Idris Elba, includes a price of 99p per episode or £1.49 for three – though a source last night said these were guide prices based on charges being offered by other services. Rob Wilson MP last night warned the BBC against overcharging licence-fee payers. He said: ‘It raises significant questions about what the licence-fee payer is actually paying for and whether the current system works in a digital age.’ A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘We know people want to keep older programmes so we hope to launch BBC Store. This commercial online service will give people the opportunity to own a digital copy – just like they can on DVD – to watch and keep.’","Doctor Who, Luther, Sherlock, Murphy's Law and Human Planet included .

"Applicants for a job interview with LG Electronics in Chile had the scare of their lives when the company played a cruel prank on them that has been turned into an amusing TV advertisement. To promote just how life-like images appear on the company’s 82-inch ‘Ultra HD’ TV, LG created a fake office in which one of its screen was positioned to look like a window. Four unlucky applicants – two men and two women – were then filmed in the fake office being interviewed for a job with the company. Scroll down for video .

The interviewee reactions after the prank are just as animated as some scream and shout, while others are quick to see the funny side of things and are probably just grateful that they haven’t just experienced the apocalypse. It is a cruel but entertaining prank which does a highly effective job of promoting LG's ultra high-def televisions. However, some comments online by those who have seen the ad claim the whole process was faked. They claim actors are playing the parts of applicants and interviewers to promote the company's latest television. Either way, it's not yet known which is true.

"The British are coming! The British are coming! Hamleys, the most popular and oldest toy store in all of Britain, has set its sights on America, and is making plans to roll out stores across the country. They are currently looking at locations in New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles. Scroll down for video . Crossing the pond: The popular British toy store Hamleys is looking to open in shops in America . Big expansion: Hamleys is considering opening a store in new York City, one in Chicago and one in Los Angeles . The trade journal Property Week is also reporting that Hamleys may open 20 smaller storefronts in airports around the United States. One of the best known stores in the world, Hamleys first opened back in London in 1760 under the name Noah's Ark, with the flagship moving to its current location on Regent Street in 1881 and its name being changed to Hamleys in honor of founder William Hamley. The flagship is said to contain upwards of 50,000 toys over seven floors, and has become a major tourist destination in its own right. Towering titan: Toys 'R' Us remains the biggest toy store in America, and has more locations than any other toy store in the world . Legend: Meanwhile, F.A.O. Schwartz in New York City is the most iconic toy store, and operated by Toys 'R' Us . The company has been expanding since it was purchased by French retailer Groupe Ludendo in 2012 and now has close to 40 stores around the world in locations like Mumbai, Moscow and even the Saudi capital of Riyadh. And while Hamleys has thrived overseas, American staples like Toys 'R' Us and F.A.O. Schwartz can take solace in the fact that many British exports have a difficult time thriving in America.

"The BBC was forced into an embarrassing apology last night after broadcasting footage of Jimmy Savile leering over a young woman on Top Of The Pops, and apparently brushing her top. The astonishing gaffe went out on BBC2 on Saturday September 13 at 10.45pm when viewers tuned in to watch Top Of The Pops Two, a compilation programme of vintage hits from the 1970s and 80s. In the footage originally filmed in 1971, Savile – now known as Britain’s most notorious paedophile – is seen among a crowd of music fans who are dancing during a performance by The Mixtures. Scroll down for video . 'Insulting': The footage from 1971 shows Jimmy Savile on Top Of The Pops, as he appears to brush his hand over an unknown girl's top . Seemingly unaware that he is being filmed, he is shown speaking intently to the young woman and appears to brush her top as he wags his finger. The woman’s identity is unknown, but the BBC received complaints from viewers and the images were later removed from a repeat of the show available on the BBC’s iPlayer service, with a note saying the content had been edited. Last night, one of Savile’s victims reacted to the blunder with anger and dismay. Deborah Cogger, 54, who was sexually abused by Savile when she was just 14, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘When are they going to learn? They’ve got no regard for anybody except themselves. Doesn’t anyone vet these programmes before they come out? ‘It’s just not good enough. I want to know who’s in charge. Somebody must know what content is in the programme before it hits the screen. It just takes my breath away. These people have a total disregard for people’s feelings.’ She added: ‘I’m utterly shocked and disgusted. This is an insult not only to Savile’s victims, but also the general public. I think they should destroy all footage they’ve got of him. Why anyone would want to keep it for posterity, I’ve no idea. The BBC is throwing mud at us, disregarding everything we’ve done and how far we’ve come in our fight.’ Edited: The online iPlayer message . Liz Dux, an abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon, which is representing 174 of Savile’s victims, added: ‘You can’t underestimate the amount of distress Savile’s victims will have suffered if they have seen this. 'It is a constant reminder of what they have been through. Many of them still await the findings of the BBC inquiry and a resolution to questions that have been ongoing for nearly two years. Seeing something like this reawakens their suffering.’ And MP Rob Wilson said: ‘Having failed to deal with a series of paedophile BBC stars, it’s astonishing it could put Jimmy Savile on air again apparently touching a young woman. This will be very hurtful to his many victims and is particularly inept of the Corporation.’ When contacted by The Mail on Sunday, the Corporation apologised ‘for any distress caused’. The BBC confirmed it had received seven complaints about the footage, but this is not the first time it has allowed offensive footage of Savile to slip through editing. Last year, it was forced to apologise after airing an impersonation of Savile on children’s TV channel, CBeebies. The BBC received more than 200 complaints after showing a 2001 episode of the Tweenies featuring a character sporting a blond wig and a gold necklace, who did a convincing impression of the disgraced star’s Yorkshire accent. Savile is now known to have abused hundreds of young victims over six decades. But the former Top Of The Pops presenter, who received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 – a year before the allegations emerged in an ITV documentary after the BBC shelved a Newsnight investigation into the star. The Corporation’s failure to run the Newsnight story led to the £2.4million Pollard Review. A judge-led inquiry looking into sexual abuse at the BBC is due to report at the end of the year and the scandal prompted the Metropolitan Police to set up Operation Yewtree, which has encouraged hundreds of victims to come forward and report abuse by Savile and other celebrities. Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘We have reviewed references to Jimmy Savile across archive footage, including a number which were brought to our attention. Where the material is likely to cause offence to his victims it is removed. Although all programmes are reviewed before broadcast, unfortunately this brief appearance was missed. It was removed from iPlayer as soon as we were made aware and replaced with a re-edited version. We apologise  for any distress caused.’","BBC apologies after airing footage of Jimmy Savile on Top Of The Pops .

"Chelsea's £40million-a-year club record shirt sponsorship deal with The Yokohama Rubber Company, announced on Thursday evening, will help to guarantee that the Premier League’s shirt deals are collectively worth twice as much as those in the next most lucrative league, Germany’s Bundesliga. Chelsea have signed a five-year deal worth £200m with the Japanese tyre giants, meaning they now have the second highest shirt sponsorship deal in England, indeed in the world, after Manchester United. United’s deal with Chevrolet was agreed and signed in 2012 on terms of $559m (£332.6m) over seven years, starting with this season, 2014-15. At the exchange rates applicable at the time of the deal, that makes United’s deal worth £47m-a-year. Chelsea revealed their club record sponsorship deal with The Yokohama Rubber Company on Thursday . Manchester United take £47m a year from Chevrolet - here Angel di Maria is pictured with one of the cars . Liverpool's shirt sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered is worth around £20m a year . Chelsea’s deal with Yokohama is even more massive than the deals currently in place at Europe’s biggest, richest and most financially savvy clubs - Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. That trio have current agreements respectively with Emirates, Qatar Airways and Deutsche Telekom each worth around €30 million per year, or about £25m a year at the exchange rates in place at the time. The upshot of the Chelsea deal is that the 20 current Premier League clubs have shirt sponsorship deals in place or upcoming collectively worth a staggering £216.35m, according to exclusive analysis by Sportsmail. That means the average deal is worth more than £10m a year, or £10.8m per club to be precise. Of course within the division there are huge variations. After United and Chelsea, Arsenal make £30m a year from Emirates, Liverpool make £20m a year from Standard Chartered and Manchester City make £20m a year from Etihad. At the other end of the scale, Crystal Palace’s deal with Neteller is worth not quite £1m and Southampton, Burnley and Leicester have deals worth £1m a year - although those will grow if in the Premier League next season. According a new authoritative study published this week by industry analysts Repucom, the 18 clubs of the Bundesliga have shirt deals worth £101m collectively - or less than half the Premier League levels when Chelsea’s new deal is factored in. That works out at £5.6m per Bundesliga club per season. Repucom’s European Football Jersey Report looks at shirt deals across Europe’s major leagues and shows that the La Liga clubs in Spain collectively have deals worth £82m, with more than half that sum at Barca and Real Madrid alone, and the equivalent sums elsewhere are £70m in France’s Ligue 1, £60m in Italy’s Serie A and £31m in the top flight in the Netherlands. Cheslea's Yokohama Rubber deal is even more valuable than Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona's . Manchester City make £20m a year from Etihad - who also sponsor their stadium . Chelsea’s new deal shows the staggering earning potential for ‘super clubs’ with genuine global followings, and highlights the global nature of the Premier League as so many foreign companies seek to use English football to sell their wares to an international audience. This season 14 shirts feature overseas-based companies, compared to 10 last season. Companies from the United Arab Emirates, South Korea (Samsung, to be replaced by Yokohama), the US, the Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and China are represented. Despite a football-wide ban on betting, gambling companies continue to feature prominently in the Premier League. This season five shirts feature gambling companies: those at Aston Villa (Dafabet.com), Stoke (Bet365), Hull (12Bet), Burnley (Fun88) and West Ham (Betway) – compared to three last season. The total value of the Premier League’s shirt deals have doubled in five seasons. In 2010-11 (details here) they were worth £100.45m. Gambling companies continue to feature prominently in the Premier League with Bet365 sponsoring Stoke . Arsenal: Renewed their sponsorship deal with major airline Fly Emirates in 2012, with the brand continuing to sponsor the stadium, too. Aston Villa: Entered two-year agreement with Dafabet, a leading Asian online betting website, in 2013. Burnley: Previous shirt sponsor in 2010/12 Fun 88 brought back this season, described as Asia’s leading online gaming brand. Chelsea: The Blues' huge new shirt sponsorship deal with The Yokohama Rubber Company is the second highest kit deal ever signed by a Premier League club. Crystal Palace: Neteller, a leading global online payments provider,will be official sponsor for the 2014/15 and 2015/16 seasons. Everton: Hold longest-running shirts sponsorship with Chang Beer, a Thai brand, with the relationship having started 10 years ago. Hull City: Global sports betting brand 12Bet confirmed on two-year deal at the start of the season. Leicester City: King Power, who also sponsor the stadium, are the 'King of Duty Free' and have held a partnership with the Foxes since 2010. Liverpool: Extended deal with bank Standard Chartered until the end of 2015/16 season in 2013. Manchester City : Announced largest sponsorship deal of its kind back in 2011 after agreeing 10-year deal with Arab airline Etihad. Manchester United: Old Trafford club signed a seven-year shirt sponsorship with the American car giants Chevrolet that started this season. Newcastle: Controversial pay-day loans company Wonga have sponsored the north east club since 2012 after singing four-year-agreement. QPR: Low-cost airline AirAsia, owned by QPR owner Tony Fernandes, extended their shirt sponsorship deal with the club last summer. Southampton: Global consumer electronics company Veho signed a two-year deal with the south coast club in 2014. Stoke City: Mark Hughes' side is coming to the end of their three-year shirt sponsorship deal with betting company Bet365 . Sunderland: North east club signed four-year shirt sponsorship deal with national food service company Bidvest at the start of this season. Swansea: The Swans extended their deal with online trading company GWFX for another two years, the biggest deal in the club's history. Tottenham Hotspur: Spurs signed a five-year deal with insurance services provider AIA ahead of this season after they were the shirt sponsor for cup games last campaign. West Ham: Hammers announced deal with gaming company Betway earlier in February a month after previous sponsor Alpari went bust. West Brom: Intuit QuickBooks, a leader in small business accounting software, teamed up with the Baggies last summer after agreeing one-year deal.","Chelsea reveal shirt sponsorship with The Yokohama Rubber Company .

"Wojciech Szczesny will discover how far his stock has plummeted in the eyes of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger on Sunday. The Gunners travel to Brighton for their FA Cup fourth round tie. Wenger’s usual policy is to play one of his reserve goalkeepers in domestic cup competitions. Wojciech Szczesny (right) speaks to Arsenal goalkeeping coach Gerry Peyton prior to the Man City game . Szczesny has recently found himself on the Gunners' bench, behind David Ospina . Having recently lost his place to David Ospina due to a loss of form and his smoking shame following the defeat at Southampton on New Years Day, the Pole’s position at the Emirates Stadium is under a huge cloud. Despite the fact Ospina has replaced Szczesny in recent weeks, Wenger has publicly maintained the Poland international remains his ‘No 1’ keeper. However, there were indications on Saturday that Ospina would be rested for the trip to Brighton - a further hint towards the Colombian now being the club’s first choice - leaving Szczesny and Damien Martinez to battle it out to play against Brighton.

Ospina dives to his right, attempting to save a shot from Manchester City's David Silva (right) Given Wenger’s penchant for playing his second or third choice keeper in the cup, if Szczesny is involved on Sunday, it would provide a key clue as to where he features in his manager’s thoughts. Wenger has made the capture of a new No 1 keeper - along with central midfielder - a summer priority. Fiorentina’s Norberto Neto has been scouted by Gunners spies while Wenger would love to sign Petr Cech but realises Jose Mourinho is unlikely to consider selling the keeper to a direct rival. And with the No 1 jersey up for grabs, Szczesny’s future at the club could be drawing to a close, with the Pole unlikely to settle for a regular place on the bench next season.","Arsene Wenger's usual policy is to play a reserve keeper in domestic cups .

"Charities benefiting from the Tower of London poppies are set for a £1 million boost after George Osborne announced he will waive the VAT from the sale of the ceramic flowers. Up to four million people are expected to have visited the installation, Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red by ceramic artist Paul Cummins, before it is dismantled on November 12. By the time it is completed 888,246 ceramic poppies will fill the moat surrounding the Tower, one for each British and colonial death during the First World War. Chancellor George Osborne (centre) with artist Paul Cummins (left) and Yeoman Warder of the Tower of London Jim Duncan (right) outside Number 11 Downing Street . A team of 11,000 volunteers will begin removing the display on November 12, with the proceeds from the sale of the poppies being split between six charities providing support to service personnel, veterans and their families. The expected VAT bill of £1.1 million from the sale of the display will be covered using some of the Libor fines collected from the banks. The Chancellor said: 'Each one of these poppies brought from their Derby factory to the Tower of London represents a British soldier who answered the call from their country a century ago and made the ultimate sacrifice. 'Their sacrifice reminds us of the part played throughout recent times by our Armed Forces to preserve our security and freedom, and of the debt we owe them.' Mr Osborne added: 'It is therefore right that we use the fines from those who've demonstrated the worst of values to support those who demonstrate the best of values everyday.' All net proceeds plus a guaranteed 10 per cent from every £25 poppy sold will be shared equally amongst six service charities: Cobseco, Combat Stress, Coming Home, Help for Heroes, the Royal British Legion and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airman and Families Association (SSAFA). The Government's donation will be up to £1.1 million, equivalent of the expected net sum of the VAT receipts collected on sales. At Prime Minsiter's Questions yesterday, David Cameron said the project had 'brought forward from the British public a huge amount of reverence for those who have given their lives and served our country'. He added: 'It is an extraordinary display and one that the country can be very proud of.' The Blood Swept Lands and Seas Of Red Poppy Installation at the Tower of London is being urged to stay open for longer . David Cameron yesterday paid tribute to the installation which he said had 'brought forward from the British public a huge amount of reverence for those who have given their lives' London Mayor Boris Johnson has called for the field of ceramic poppies to remain at the Tower of London beyond Armistice Day. The London mayor said the huge popularity of the exhibition meant he wanted to explore whether it could be kept at the site for longer than originally planned. A spokeswoman for the mayor said he was in discussion with Historic Royal Palaces, the agency which runs the Tower of London, about extending the exhibition for a further week. But Historic Royal Palaces said that it was always the intention to begin sending the poppies - which have been sold to raise cash for charity - to their new owners after Armistice Day on November 11. General Lord Dannatt, Constable of the Tower of London and former head of the Army, said: 'We are delighted with the Chancellor's decision to donate the equivalent net VAT made on the sale of the ceramic poppies that have formed the art installation Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red at the Tower of London. 'With this generous contribution the project will have raised even more money for our charity partners enabling them to carry out their vital work.

"Michelle Obama has written an open letter to Newtown as the community struggles to come to terms with one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. The First Lady penned words of comfort to the small Connecticut town which is today enduring more funerals after the attack on Sandy Hook elementary school one week ago.

As . a mother of two young daughters, my heart aches for you and your . families. Like so many Americans, I wish there were something - anything . - I could do or say to ease your anguish. But .

Over . the past week, I have been awed and inspired by Newtown's heroes: the . first responders who risked their lives at a moment's notice; the . educators whose devotion to their students shone brightest in one of our . nation's darkest hours; the children who comforted each other despite . their fear; the families coming together to support each other as they . grieve. And I am so proud . of the outpouring of love and support that has come from every corner of . America: from first responders from neighboring cities rushing to help . however they could; from people in Cleveland and Charlotte and Juneau . and so many other communities joining together to honor Newtown with . their thoughts and prayers; and in living rooms and houses of worship . and the halls of our government, where we are beginning to have those . difficult conversations about how we can build a safer, more peaceful . tomorrow for all our children. And . I want you to know that this is just the beginning. As my husband has . said, in the coming weeks, he will use all the powers of his office to . engage citizens from across this country to find ways to prevent . tragedies like this one. And please know that every minute of every day, . we are thinking of you, and praying for you, and holding you and your . families in our hearts as you begin the slow and wrenching work of . healing and moving forward. In . the months and years ahead, may the memories of those beautiful . children and those heroic adults be a blessing for their families, for . your community, and for our country, and may God bless you all. President Obama took part in the moment of silence at the White House. The President visited the small Connecticut town earlier in the week to comfort grieving families and survivors. Obama also told mourners that America was not doing enough to protect its children and pledged a huge . effort to 'prevent more tragedies like this'. 'You are not alone in your grief,' President Obama said. 'All across this land our world too has . been torn apart. 'All across this land we wept with you and pulled our . children tight. Newtown, you are not alone.' In one of the most religious speeches of his presidency, Mr Obama talked about how the ultimate goal for a society is to protect their children. 'If . we don't get that right, we don't get anything right. By that measure, . can we truly say as a nation that we are doing our obligations?' he . said. 'We gather here in memory of 20 . beautiful children and six remarkable adults.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘I would love to see the display carry on further if the balance can be got right between extending it and making sure the charities which will benefit from the sale of the poppies still get the money they need.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who was moved to tears when he viewed the display on Tuesday, added: ‘I told them myself they should be extending it because there are millions of people who would love to go and who just have not yet had the opportunity.’ A source close to Mr Johnson said talks about an extension were ongoing. Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg have not yet visited the display. Labour did not respond to a question about whether Mr Miliband has been to see the display, called Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red. Nick Clegg, left, and Ukip leader Nigel Farage, right have also said that the installation should be extended . All 888,246 poppies – one for each British and colonial death during the war – have now been sold at £25 each, with part of the estimated £15million proceeds shared between six service charities. Historic Royal Palaces denied that it was unwilling to extend the display because of the planned pre-Christmas corporate events – the first of which is thought to be the annual business awards for the British Chambers of Commerce on November 27. The ice rink that is usually set up in the moat has already been cancelled to avoid causing a clash with the artwork. A HRP spokesman said it was involved in ongoing discussions, but added: ‘The poppies will be removed from the moat starting on November 12, as planned. However, it has always been our intention that the installation would have a legacy beyond November 11.’","Leaders have added their pleas for the poppy tribute to remain in place .

"Oculus Rift, the virtual reality firm recently bought by Facebook for $2bn, is expected to release a consumer version next - and one designer has revealed a stunning concept of how it could look. The rift concept has a flexible screen, gesture sensors and headphones built in to transport the wearer to a virtual world. Its designer claims the gadget could for for virtual reality what the iPhone did for mobile phones. Scroll down for video . This concept by Carlos Pendas gives a glimpse as to what The final consumer version of the Oculus Rift headset could look like. The firm's co-founder claims it could cost as little as $200. Spot the difference: The current prototype of the Oculus Rift . 'I wanted to go a year or two into the future and imagine the Oculus Rift for everyone, the one that would do for peripherals what the iPhone did for smartphones, and constraint my design to something that could be technically feasible,' said Carlos Pendas, the Mexican designer who created the concept. 'I completely drifted away form the aggressive shapes normally found in gaming hardware. 'The consumer Rift needs to be subtle and friendly, it doesn’t need ornaments to stand out. 'It also needs to be approachable, as it faces the risk of intimidating the consumer.' The concept comes just weeks after Facebook was been given U.S. antitrust approval to buy Oculus VR in a $2bn deal, the Federal Trade Commission has revealed. Facebook said on March 25 that it planned to buy Oculus for $2 billion in its first-ever hardware deal. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the proposed transaction reflected his company's desire to bet on 'the platforms of tomorrow'. The concept is designed around 3 main features: a curved screen, integrated headphones and a gesture recognition system. The headset will plug into a laptop computer to transport wearer's to a virtual world . MailOnline was able to try Oculus Rift at the CES show in Las Vegas earlier this year. At first we were skeptical - the headset looks bulky, although it is surprisingly light when  attached via straps. However, once our demo started, doubts were quickly forgotten. The technology, still just a developer's version, is breathtakingly good. While the resolution still doesn't give the feeling of quite being in the real world, it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world. During several demonstrations we entered a vast dungeon and flew through space, with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as the user's head moves. It's not quite ready for primetime yet, but is almost there - and the Oculus Rift headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality. The Oculus buy was one of several high-profile purchases by Facebook, which recently won antitrust approval to acquire Whatsapp, an instant messaging service for smartphones, for $19 billion. It also bought the photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012. The social network announced last month it had reached a definitive agreement to acquire Oculus VR, a California firm founded by 21 year old college dropout Palmer Luckey. 'Mobile is the platform of today, and now we're also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,' said Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg at the time. 'It's different from anything I've every experienced in my life.' The firm is among the most advanced in the VR field, and recently began taking orders for the latest version of its $350 developers version. 'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Zuckerberg. 'Immersive gaming will be the first, and Oculus already has big plans here that won't be changing and we hope to accelerate. 'The Rift is highly anticipated by the gaming community, and there's a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform. 'We're going to focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games. 'Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook to achieve this. 'But this is just the start. 'After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. 'Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face - just by putting on goggles in your home.' The $2bn deal includes $400 million in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook common stock. 'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Mark Zuckerberg, pictured . Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers, having received more than 75,000 orders for development kits for the company's virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift. Facebook said 'While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology, and Facebook plans to extend Oculus' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas.' Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers 'The Matrix - that's always been the dream,' said one Oculus Rift executive of its headset, pictured . The Oculus prototype, pictured, is packed with components - many of which Mark Zuckerberg claims can be found in a mobile phone, making the gadget relatively easy to produce . 'We are excited to work with Mark and the Facebook team to deliver the very best virtual reality platform in the world,' said Brendan Iribe, co-founder and CEO of Oculus VR. 'We believe virtual reality will be heavily defined by social experiences that connect people in magical, new ways. Palmer Luckey of Oculus . 21-year-old Palmer Luckey began Oculus when he was just 15, working on prototypes in his parent's garage. He started developing his own head-mounted VR displays when he was still in high school, and was in college when he created the first prototype of a consumer-priced VR headset called the Oculus Rift - although he eventually left to work on the project full time. MailOnline met Luckey at the CES show in Las Vegas, where he showed an incredible amount of enthusiasm for the product. He said he believed the technology's time had come. The firm originally turned to Kickstarter to raise money, but has since raised funds from investors across silicon Valley - until it was today bought by Facebook for $2bn. 'It is a transformative and disruptive technology, that enables the world to experience the impossible, and it's only just the beginning.' Oculus recently raised $75m to make the headset. 'Over the past 16 months, we’ve grown from a startup to a company whose technology is poised to change the way we play, work and communicate,' said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus VR at the time.","The concept is designed around 3 main features: a curved screen, integrated headphones and a gesture recognition system .

"It looks like the sort of cartoon car that Noddy might drive. But this is the computerised ‘hands-free’ self-driving bubble car planned by Google. The car has no steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, just buttons for start, pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing your route. Google hopes to have 100 of the revolutionary two-seater electric-powered  vehicles on roads within a year – provided the law allows them. Scroll down for video . No hands: Google has begun work on the world's first ever self-driving car, an early prototype of which is pictured above . But no . sooner had the plans been announced than cyber-security experts were . warning the software could be targeted by hackers to create traffic . mayhem. Google plans to have prototypes ready to test later this summer and says the goal is for the car to ‘shoulder the entire burden of driving’. Google says the car has a ‘friendly’ face to give a non-threatening appearance and help the public accept the new technology. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians. Speed is restricted to 25mph and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles. This works by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights. Happy customers: A company video showed test subjects taking a spin in the car, and their delighted reactions to the sensation of being transported without the need to control the car . Clever: Rather than reworking an existing vehicle, the tech giant is building its own contraption with the goal that it can 'shoulder the entire burden of driving' Self-driving cars work by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle's exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree 'view'. These sensors are linked to computer software that is able to 'see¿ and identify people, cars and road signs . The computer brain is programmed with road rules and guides the car to a chosen destination. It combines technology mainstream car manufacturers – including Volvo, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, and Honda – have been working on and which already exists in modern cars, such as autonomous braking, adaptive cruise control and lane recognition. The biggest obstacle could be the law. By the end of this year, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles plans to implement regulations for the use of driverless cars. Four US states – Nevada, Florida, California, and Michigan – have passed laws permitting autonomous cars. Project director Chris Urmson said the cars will revolutionise driving, helping to remove the ‘human error’ blamed for nine out of ten crashes. He said: ‘This is a first step for us. It’s going to be incredibly empowering. They won’t have a steering wheel, accelerator pedal, or brake pedal…because they don’t need them. Our software and sensors do all the work.’ Google car safety director Ron Medford, former deputy director of the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said road deaths could be drastically reduced by removing human driver error. ‘It has the potential to be the most important safety technology the auto industry has ever seen,’ he said. But computer experts warned the reliance on software could lead to ‘spam jams’ and gridlock caused by computer hackers. Will Rockall, director at KPMG’s cyber security team, said: ‘Self-drive cars will probably work through internet connectivity and, just as large volumes of electronic traffic can be routed to overwhelm websites, the opportunity for self-drive traffic being routed to create “spam jams” or disruption is a very real prospect.’ Safety first: The company is currently building some prototypes that are designed to operate safely and autonomously without requiring human intervention .

"A man accused of making child pornography with a boy he and his Australian partner purchased in Russia for a reported $8000 was sentenced Friday in U.S. federal court in Indiana.According to investigators, dual Australian-American citizen Mark J Newton, 42, and his partner Peter Truong, 36, used a falsified birth certificate listing Newton as the child's biological father to adopt the boy and take him to their home in Cairns in Queensland, Australia. Newton was sentenced to 40 years in an Indiana court, where the videos were found downloaded on a home computer after pleading guilty to conspiracy charges involving possessing child pornography and sexual exploitation of a minor. False: Peter Truong (left) and Mark Newton (right) told people the boy they brought home from Russia was Newton's biological son born via surrogate and used falsified papers to adopt the child . The judge overseeing the case said she accepted the plea agreement only because the videos were too horrific to show a jury. Australia's ABC News reports that the boy, now eight, had been living with the men in Cairns for several years when in 2011 New Zealand authorities discovered evidence on a New Zealand man's computer that the boy had been used in child pornography.Australian police raided the couple's house in 2011, just after the men and the boy had left for the United States. Police discovered a 'mountain of material' and seized computers, electronic equipment and documents that uncovered high-definition video and images of child exploitation. During the hearing, prosecutors said the charges stemmed from abuse that occurred when the boy was four to six years old. But prosecutors said they discovered video this week showing Newton using the boy for a sex act when he was less than two years old. Investigators also allege the man and his partner took the boy to foreign countries where they allowed other men to abuse him, often recording the acts. The videos were uploaded to an international syndicate known as the Boy Lovers Network.The Boy Lovers Network is known to police as a forum for men who describe sexual abuse of boys between the ages of two and 10 as a form of consensual love between man and boy. Pedophile ring: Newton was arrested in California after images of the boy were found on computers and traced to him and Truong . According to 7:30, Boylover.net had 70,000 members worldwide before it was the subject of a series of global raids that resulted in the arrests of 670 men around the world.'These men submitted this young child to some of the most heinous acts of exploitation that this office has ever seen,' Indiana U.S. Attorney Joe Hogsett said in a statement late Friday, following the hearing.Newton and Truong had been living with the boy in California when they were arrested in 2012. Prosecutors said the boy had been rescued and was being cared for in California.U.S. District Judge Sarah Evans Barker said the man sentenced Friday deserved a harsher punishment, but she didn't want to subject jurors to such disturbing evidence.'This is not a case that lends itself to easy understanding,' Barker said during the hearing.In a quaking voice, the shackled Newton stood before Barker and apologized, saying 'being a father was an honor and a privilege that amounted to the best six years of my life.''I'm deeply sorry,' he added. 'And I regret any harm I caused to my son or anyone else.''Words don't help,' Barker responded. 'What can be said? What can be done to erase some of the horror of this?'The judge noted that Newton and Truong went to great lengths to 'acquire' an infant from a mother in Russia and brainwashed him into thinking the abuse he endured was normal. Family home: This is the house where Newton and Truong lived with the boy they paid $8000 for when they returned to Australia . Horrified: Judge Sarah Evans Barker didn't want to put the trial by a jury because she felt the evidence was too heinous for people to witness . Federal prosecutor Steve DeBrota said the crimes occurred in Australia, the U.S., France and Germany. U.S. authorities also found videos involving two more boys at Truong and Newton's Cairns home.DeBrota said evidence showed at least eight men had sexually abused the boy, including one in Illinois and one in Florida, though other details weren't released.Newton was also ordered to pay $400,000 in restitution to the boy.Monica Foster, chief public defender for the Southern Indiana U.S. District, declined comment following the hearing. The document also said the men used falsified documents to bring the boy to the U.S. and to legalize the adoption in Los Angeles.Pornographic recordings of the abuse were found on computers in San Francisco; Arlington, Virginia; and Anderson, Indiana, according to investigators. U.S. postal inspectors worked with federal prosecutors to trace the pornography to its source. Truong is awaiting his sentence, while two other American men have also been charged.Queensland police officer Jon Rouse, who investigates online child exploitation as part of Taskforce Argos, says authorities in Australia won't rest until all the men involved in the network have been caught. 'With this network, rest assured that we will pursue them to the ends of the Earth to make sure each and every one of them faces justice for what their role has been in crimes against this child,' he told 7.30. 'The purchase of the child for the explicit and sole purpose of exploiting him across a network of men is incredibly depraved and a very sad tale for that little boy.' Truong and Newton evaded detection for six years, appearing for all intents and purposes as doting parents of a little boy, until the chance discovery in New Zealand exposed their true motivations. President Vladimir Putin has signed a bill that sharply limits the adoption of Russian children by people from countries that allow same-sex marriage. The new law prohibits adoption by same-sex foreign couples whose homeland recognizes their union as marriage, as well as by single people or unmarried couples from those countries. A Kremlin statement said the measure is intended to guarantee children a 'harmonious' upbringing and protect them from 'complexes, emotional suffering and stress.' The bill signed Wednesday is the latest move by Russia to buck the Western trend toward greater acceptance of homosexuality. On Sunday, Putin approved a ban on giving children any information about gays. The adoption bill further shrinks the possibilities for 600,000 Russian children without parental custody. Last year, Russia banned all adoptions by Americans.","Mark J Newton was given 40 years for child pornography and sexual exploitation of a minor .

"Repairs to the crumbling Houses of Parliament could cost taxpayers more than £3billion. The historic Palace of Westminster is in such poor condition that MPs and peers may have to move out for five years while works are carried out. Officials say the landmark by the Thames will not survive without significant investment. Scroll down for video . Disrepair: Peeling paintwork on a roof of the Palace of Westminster. It may have to close for five years . Among the problems are leaking roofs and pipes, ancient electrics and plumbing, asbestos, subsidence, badly-damaged stonework and fire risks. The building, which has housed peers since 1847 and MPs since 1852, has not had a major renovation since the 1940s, when German bomb damage was dealt with. Richard Ware, who is leading the restoration project, said politicians and their staff would end up ‘working in a ruin’ if nothing was done. ‘We’re moving backwards,’ he told BBC2’s Newsnight. ‘The building is getting older faster than we can deal with it. It is on borrowed time.’ Restoration costs were put at about £1.4billion in a 2012 report. But sources say the ‘working assumption’ now is that the bill will reach £3billion. An independent report opens up the possibility of keeping the building open and MPs working there while repairs are carried out. But this is likely to be rejected because it might extend the timetable to up to 50 years. A second report setting out the costs of the different options has been completed, but will not be published until after next year’s election. Borrowed time: Repairs to the crumbling Houses of Parliament (pictured) could cost taxpayers more than £3billion . MPs and peers will then have to decide how the work should be carried out. It is expected to begin in 2020 or 2021, and may require legislation. The huge cost and disruption make the decision a politically charged one and a quango similar to the Olympic Delivery Authority is likely to be created to oversee the project. Parliamentary officials stress that it is impossible to put a firm figure on the cost at this stage because no decision has been taken about which option to pursue. The Palace of Westminster was designed by architect Charles Barry after the previous building was destroyed by fire in 1834. Grade I listed, it has 100 staircases and more than 1,100 rooms. It is a Unesco world heritage site.","Officials fear the building will not survive without significant investment .

"Ed Miliband today faced questions over how much he is worth as the Labour leader tried to play down claims he was targeting David Cameron’s background for political advantage. The morning after his widely-praised conference speech, Mr Miliband was forced to defend claims the Prime Minister would personally benefit from a ‘tax cut for millionaires’ but refused to discuss his own levels of personal wealth. In his speech, Mr Miliband said: ‘David Cameron isn’t just writing the cheques. He is receiving one. He’s going to be getting the millionaire’s tax cut. Labour leader Ed Miliband toured the TV studios today to face questions about his conference speech in Manchester . ‘So next week maybe Mr Cameron can tell us how much is he awarding himself in a tax cut? How much is that tax cut he is awarding himself?’ But he appeared to row back from the claim today, after business experts accused him of confusing people with net assets worth more than £1million with the much smaller group who earn seven-figure sums every year. Asked on BBC Breakfast how much he was worth, Mr Miliband replied: ‘I am not going to be getting the top rate tax cut.’ But pressed on whether he was ‘worth £1million’, Mr Miliband looked panicked and tried to claim he was not using the Prime Minister’s upbringing to gain votes. ‘I am not making an issue of David Cameron’s background.’ Mr Miliband, whose Primrose Hill home is reportedly worth £1.6million, criticised the Prime Minister for cutting the top-rate of tax and said he didn't think ""it was the kind of country we should be in"". But in the same interview he attacked Mr Cameron for cutting the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p for those earning more than £150,000, and claimed the PM will benefit personally. ‘Mr Cameron's aides have said he will be receiving a tax cut in the top rate of tax when it is cut from 50 to 45 per cent,’ Mr Miliband said. ‘Why does that matter? That matters because if you're the Prime Minister and you're cutting taxes for a very small section of the population and raising them for everyone else. ‘You're cutting taxes for the richest in society. I think that's wrong, I don't think that's the kind of country we should be in.' Ed Miliband was joined on the conference stage by his wife Justine after his speech . Yesterday Mr Miliband’s speech was packed with references to his own upbringing, attending a comprehensive school in North London, which was seen as an attempt to contrast with Mr Cameron’s schooling at Eton. He said that as a pupil at Haverstock school he ‘learned how to get on with people from all backgrounds, whoever they were’. Tory MPs have accused the Labour leader of indulging in ‘class war’ by making a big play of his educational background to contrast with David Cameron’s Eton schooling. Graham Evans said it was ‘a bit rich’ for him to pretend he is from a down-to-earth background when his family were very wealthy and came from the ‘Labour elite’. Four of Mr Miliband’s shadow Cabinet colleagues – including Harriet Harman and Ed Balls – were privately educated. Mr Miliband received largely positive coverage for yesterday’s speech, delivered without notes or an autocue. Today he revealed that the 65-minute address had been longer than he originally planned. ‘The notes for the speech, such that they were, were 6,000 words and I delivered 7,500,’ he told BBC Radio 4. ‘People are fed up with politics which feels like it is reading out something that someone else has written for you. I tried to say what I believed and that is the best thing to do.’ Despite using much of the speech to distance himself from New Labour, attacking its failures on welfare and immigration, Mr Miliband said he was 'flattered' at being compared to Tony Blair.'I think I’m pretty flattered by that comparison, Tony Blair was incredible at conference speeches. But it’s a different time. 'What I do feel, the reason I did that speech yesterday, was that people want to know about who the person is, where we're going to take the country.'","The Labour leader looks uncomfortable as he challenged on TV over how much he is worth .

"The mother of Sandy Hook Elementary gunman Adam Lanza has been remembered at a small family-only gathering at the Kingston, New Hampshire home where she grew up. Nancy Lanza, who was shot by her 20-year-old son as she lay in bed in their Connecticut home last Friday, lived in the 1760s-era home where her brother James Champion, a policeman, now lives. On Thursday, around two dozen relatives and friends in dark clothing attended the home for the service, but it is not known whether the memorial also served as a funeral or if she has been buried. While authorities said her body had been claimed and released to a funeral home - without providing further details - they have not said whether Adam's body has been claimed. Remembered: A memorial service was held in New Hampshire for Nancy Lanza on Thursday afternoon . After shooting her dead, he stole her . guns and car and drove to Sandy Hook Elementary, which he had once attended, before shooting dead 20 children, six teachers and . himself. It is unclear what will become of . Adam Lanza's body if it is not claimed. In Connecticut, typical procedure is to have the police department . record that no next of kin can be found or that they are refusing to . identify the body. A . funeral home would then provide a list of volunteers who are willing to take . custody of the body through the courts. The remains would be buried or cremated with $1,800 . state funds. It is expected that Nancy Lanza's . estate would pay for the funerals. It is not known . whether his father Peter Lanza, to whom he had not spoken in two years, . or his older brother Ryan attended the service for his mother on . Thursday.

The family has . stayed silent over the matter and residents of Kingston said the . memorial had been kept quiet to avoid media attention. Mr . Champion was seen visiting the post office on Thursday but would not be . interviewed. 'It's a hard time,' he told the New York Times. 'It's a . very hard time right now.' Adam Lanza's father, Peter Lanza, has also not spoken publicly about the massacre. He has not been seen around his Stamford, Connecticut home in several days and is assumed to be in hiding. Neighbors of Peter Lanza and second . wife Shelley Cudiner told MailOnline that the pair packed up their car . and left their home shortly after being informed of Adam's involvement in the . massacre. Peter Lanza learned of the shooting from a reporter outside his home, which is located about an hour from Sandy Hook. Murdered: A small memorial service was held for Nancy in her hometown of Kingston, New Hampshire . Scene: Adam shot Nancy as she lay in bed at their Newton home, pictured, before heading to the school . Peter has been separated from Nancy Lanza since 2001 and the couple filed for divorce in 2009. Their divorce was finalized about a year later, around the time that their first son, Ryan, graduated from college and moved to work for accounting firm Ernst & Young in New York. Peter, a successful finance executive at General Electric, had not spoken to Adam in almost two years. Adam cut off contact with his father after he remarried, according to sources. Adam and his brother were also not communicating for several years, according to Peter Lanza's sister-in-law, Marsha Lanza. Before he remarried, Peter Lanza had . visited with his son at least once a week. He and Nancy had joint . custody of Adam, according to their divorce papers. Obsession: A family friend said that Adam Lanza would spend hours playing violent video games . Peter was . supporting Nancy and his son with $240,000 in annual alimony and child . support payments - an amount that was set to rise to $289,000 in 2012. He had also agreed to pay for Adam Lanza's college tuition, car and medical insurance. He was making $445,000 at the time of the divorce, records show. While Peter Lanza hasn't spoken about the tragedy publicly, he released a statement on Saturday. 'Our hearts go out to the families . and friends who lost loved ones and to all those who were injured,' he . said in the statement. 'Our family is grieving along with all those who . have been affected by this enormous tragedy. No words can truly express . how heartbroken we are. Grim task: Connecticut medical examiner Dr Wayne Carver, who has been overseeing the autopsies of the Sandy Hook shootings, speaks to the media . 'We are in a state of disbelief and trying to . find whatever answers we can. We too are asking why. We have cooperated . fully with law enforcement and will continue to do so. Like so many of . you, we are saddened, but struggling to make sense of what has . transpired.' Nancy Lanza's memorial service came as it was . revealed that Adam had desperately wanted to join . the Marines, but she would not let him.

"A borders row erupted last night after a Latvian killer was named the prime suspect over missing Alice Gross. Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was jailed in 1998 for battering his wife to death in his homeland. But after just seven years inside he was free to move here without immigration officials or police knowing of his murderous past. And he is now at the centre of an international manhunt in the case of 14-year-old Alice who vanished three weeks ago in west London. Scroll down for video . Latvian killer Arnis Zalkalns has been named the prime suspect over Alice Gross, 14, who vanished three weeks ago in west London . MPs said the case made a mockery of Britain’s borders with the European Union. ‘It’s completely unacceptable for a convicted murderer from another country to ever be allowed to stay in this country,’ said Tory backbencher Philip Davies. ‘I have no confidence in our border controls as far as I can see – they must be the laughing stock of the world now. ‘Police are never going to be able to keep tabs on the criminal records of people with European passports – they have got no chance. 'We need to get control of our borders. If we have open borders then by definition we are going to be dealing with all sorts of murderers, rapists, drug dealers and other serious criminals walking in.’ Alice’s family are said to be deeply upset by the developments. Zalkalns was convicted of murder after luring his wife to a forest outside the Latvian capital Riga where he beat her over the head with a scaffold pole and stabbed her in the chest. He was jailed for 12 years for the March 1997 murder but was released early in 2005. He fled to Britain in 2007 after his second wife and daughter from his first marriage, now 19, found out about his past. Immigration officials, who had no idea of his record, let him in. Two years later he was arrested in Ealing, west London, over an alleged indecent assault on a 14-year-old girl, but was never prosecuted because the victim was unable to substantiate her account. Alice vanished while walking on the Grand Union Canal towpath in Hanwell, west London. Zalkalns was captured on CCTV cycling along the same path just 15 minutes after the schoolgirl walked past the camera at 3.45pm on August 28. She was last seen at 4.26pm. Grainy CCTV stills show Alice crossing a canal footbridge in Hanwell, West London . The footage, captured at 3:45pm on August 28, shows Alice walking along the Grand Union Canal towpath . Teams of police divers and sniffer dogs have spent more than a week scouring a mile of the murky canal but have found no sign of the teenager. Detective Superintendent Carl Mehta, who is overseeing the inquiry, said: ‘They were both going in the same direction so it is clear he would have passed her. ‘The focus of this investigation is now what happened when this took place.’ But Scotland Yard is facing questions about why it has taken so long to reveal that their prime suspect is a convicted killer suspected of sexual assault. Zalkalns disappeared on the night of September 3 from the Ealing home he shares with his girlfriend Katerina Laiblova and their one-year-old daughter. Yesterday police were seen digging up the garden of his flat and removing potential evidence. The Home Office operates a computer system called the ‘Warnings Index’ which contains information shared by foreign countries, including European Union states, on terrorists and criminals. Anyone on the database who attempts to enter the UK is supposed to be flagged by the system, allowing immigration officers the opportunity to interview them and potentially refuse entry. However Latvian authorities insist they were under no obligation to forewarn their British colleagues about Zalkalns’ conviction because he was not wanted for any offence. Latvian police informed Scotland Yard about his record a few days ago when it was requested through Interpol. But amid farcical scenes, detectives were still awaiting details of the case yesterday, even though it took the Mail less than an hour to uncover his past. Suspect: Zalkalns, a convicted murderer, cycles past 15 minutes later at 4pm . Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was jailed in 1998 for battering his wife to death in his homeland, Latvia . Last September a report by the National Audit Office said the index was ‘unstable and at risk of collapsing’ and that it ‘contained a great deal of out-of-date information’. Last night it was unclear whether even Zalkalns’ girlfriend was aware of his past. Miss Laiblova, a 39-year-old waitress from Prague, has described him as a loving family man who dotes on their daughter Linda. Police have issued an all ports and airports alert for the Latvian and urged people not to approach him. They also announced a reward of up to £20,000 for information. Last night a Metropolitan Police spokesman said they would not comment further on the 1998 conviction: ‘As with all live investigations there is information that the police have that they cannot and should not make public. To obtain the full file in relation to the conviction of Arnis Zalkalns we now need to obtain an international letter of request.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We have detailed arrangements in place to identify people of concern entering the UK. ‘All passengers are checked against police, security and immigration watch lists and where we are aware of individuals who pose a risk, Border Force officers can – and do – refuse them entry.’","The prime suspect in hunt for Alice Gross is named as Arnis Zalkalns .

"A crisis-hit hospital flew a doctor in from India at the cost of £5,000 for a single weekend because its A&E department was left without cover. The consultant made a round trip of more than 8,000 miles to step in after the trust failed to find a local doctor. For 48 hours, the jet-lagged doctor covered two consultants’ jobs at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. He worked a 12-hour shift before being on call for a further 12 hours of Saturday, sleeping for just six hours while another consultant from intensive care was on hand to help. He repeated the same shift pattern the next day. NHS Grampian, which runs Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, paid £5,000 to fly in a doctor from India to cover a shift . It will add to fears that emergency departments are reaching breaking point, due to population pressures, the collapse of GP out-of-hours care and the ageing population. Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ‘This shows just how chaotic the Scottish government’s long-term planning has been for NHS staffing. ‘They’ve been warned for years about shortages across all areas, and these warnings have been ignored. ‘Now health boards have been left in this preposterous situation where they have to hire short-term solutions from the other side of the globe.’ Across the UK there are thousands of unfilled nursing posts, but Aberdeen faces particular trouble recruiting due to the high cost of living, with house prices approaching London heights due to the oil industry. NHS Grampian has refused to name the consultant who has been commuting from India to work in Aberdeen since the start of August. He normally works on a fortnight-on, fortnight-off basis, but a consultant fell ill last weekend, resulting in bosses paying to fly him in. Based on the average hourly rate for a local A&E consultant of £65, he would have been paid £3,120 for the 48 hours. But NHS Grampian pays locums more than that. The doctor, whose identity has not been revealed, has been commuting from India since August, working on a fortnight-on, fortnight-off basis . Dr Jean Turner, of Scotland Patients Association, said: ‘This just seems ridiculous. ‘Aberdeen should be a great place to stay and work and it is difficult to understand why we do not have the staff to cover for holidays, study leave, retirement and sickness. ‘If there is a need for a locum, it is strange that India is the nearest place to provide one to keep the NHS service going. ‘No matter how well qualified and experienced a locum is, working in a strange place will always have challenges for them compared to working as a permanent member of staff.’ An NHS spokesman said: ‘On this particular occasion, to cover short notice sick leave, we asked this doctor to provide cover over the weekend. The doctor is one of our long-term locums and works regularly in the department in Aberdeen. ‘Consultant cover was present throughout the weekend at all times. At no time has NHS Grampian been left without consultant cover.’","The jet-lagged doctor covered two consultants at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary .

"Chinese workers masterminded a super efficient way of moving huge chunks of stone 43 miles in order to build China's famous Forbidden City, engineers have claimed. Records dating from around the time of which the walled city was built, from 1406, tell that workers hauled stones weighing over 100 tonnes from a quarry 43 miles away from the site of the Forbidden City, using a network of man-made paths. However, 600 years later, engineers have revealed that a system of wells and frozen roads were used to make the stones slippery and easier to move and were more efficient than alternatives. Engineers looked into the efficiency of how the workers moved the chunks of stone. They calculated that without using the warm water (top image) 338 men would be needed to pull a stone weighing 123 tonnes and measuring 31 feet long. But using warm water to lubricate the icy road, just 46 men would be needed to move it (pictured bottom) The Forbidden City was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty. It is located in the centre of Beijing, China and now houses the Palace Museum. For almost 500 years, it served as the home of emperors and their households. Built from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 720,000 sqaured metres. The site of the Forbidden City was situated on the Imperial City during the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, but upon the establishment of the Ming Dynasty, the Emperor moved the capital from Beijing in the north to Nanjing in the south, and ordered that the Yuan palaces be burnt down. When his son Zhu Di became the Yongle Emperor, he moved the capital back to Beijing and construction began in 1406 of what would become the Forbidden City. Construction lasted 14 years and required more than a million workers. Materials used include whole logs of precious Phoebe zhennan wood found in the jungles of south-western China, and large blocks of marble from quarries near Beijing. The floors of major halls were paved with 'golden bricks' Experts from two universities in Beijing and Princeton University in the U.S. believe the workers dug small wells every 500 metres along the man-made paths to reach water that they would pour to ice the paths in the winter, as well as lubricate them. It is believed teams of men pulled the vast pieces of stone themselves. Engineers calculated the amount of friction different methods of moving the stones would produce, including the use of logs as rollers - which are believed to have been used in the creation of many ancient stone monuments. But their calculations showed sliding the stones over ice and using water to lubricate it, was the most efficient method of all, PopSci reported. The team of engineers said winter in Beijing, 600 years ago, was cold enough to keep the roads frozen but so chilly that the ice alone would not have made a good lubricating layer of water between the bottom of wooden sledges used to carry the stones and the surface of the icy paths. However, they believe the men poured just enough warm water onto the ice so that it would stay liquid and help them slide the sled along more easily. The engineers calculated that without using the warm water, 338 men would be needed to pull a stone weighing 123 tonnes and measuring 31 feet long. However, using warm water to lubricate the icy road, just 46 men would be needed to heave the same massive stone along. The weight and dimensions of the stone used for the calculations come from a document written in 1557 after the huge architectural project was finished, which says men transported stones 43 miles. Chinese workers master-minded a smart way of moving huge chunks of stone 43 miles in order to build China's famous Forbidden City (pictured).  Engineers said their system of icy paths lubricated with water to transport the stones, was the most efficient method . The modern engineers believe that pulling sledges over ice paths lubricated with water, was a more efficient option that rolling the stones over logs. In the study published in journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they said the coefficient (a quantitative expression of a specific property of matter) of friction for logs rolling along a path is 0.2 to 0.4, while using the water-and-ice-sliding method, has a coefficient of just 0.02. The experts also said that sliding sledges is easier than using logs as it is easier to make a smooth ice road than to have to make a level one of planks and manoeuvre the log rollers as well as the huge chunk of stone. Wheeled vehicles of the time would not have been able to support the weight of the large stones, according to the engineers, who think that the maximum weight carts would have been able to pull would have been 95 tonnes. They said that ice roads and men were also more reliable than mules and carts, especially as the architects of the Forbidden City were reportedly worried about keeping the expensive stone safe. The team of engineers said winter in Beijing 600 years ago was cold enough to keep roads frozen, which was useful for transporting stones.

"Levski Sofia have been fined just under £8,000 after fans mocked one of the anti-racism campaigns launched by European soccer's governing body UEFA in a Bulgarian league match last month. The Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) imposed the relatively small fine on Wednesday after several Levski supporters held up a banner stating 'Say yes to racism' and doctored UEFA logo during their 3-2 league win over champions Ludogorets. The ugly incident caused outrage in the Black Sea state. Bulgarian soccer authorities have long been criticised by anti-racism campaigners, local media and fans for not cracking down hard enough on discrimination in sport. The incident happened at Levski Sofia's Georgi Asparuhov Stadium during a league match last month . Levski, 26-times Bulgarian champions and one of the country's two most popular clubs along with bitter city rivals CSKA, have a history of racism at their matches. The BFU fined the club £15,000 after their supporters displayed a banner showing a swastika and another one marking what would have been Adolf Hitler's birthday during their game at Litex Lovech in April 2013. In 2012, Levski were fined £24,000 by UEFA for racist behaviour by fans during a Europa League match against Bosnia & Herzegovina's Sarajevo.","Levski supporters helped up a banner stating 'Say yes to racism' during a league match last month .

"Miriam Clegg has denied claims she put pressure on her husband to take a tougher stance on Lord Rennard . Nick Clegg’s wife has angrily hit back at claims that she put pressure on her husband to take a tougher stance on sex-pest allegations against Lord Rennard. In a highly unusual public statement, Miriam Clegg insisted she had nothing to do with the decision to suspend the peer from the party, describing a report suggesting so as ‘a complete fabrication’. The lawyer and mother of three, who was attending a National Inspiring Women campaign event to get women to go into schools to talk about their careers, said: ‘This is in the Telegraph today but it is a complete fabrication. I don’t even know the women [complainants]. ‘I think by now that you will know I’m the kind of woman who doesn’t influence in the shadows. If I ever wanted to say something, I would say that openly. My opinions about the political issues of the day, I keep them for myself.’ Earlier, Mr Clegg said it was ‘just not on’ to drag his family into the row and dismissed the claims as ‘garbage’. ‘I’ve read so much garbage over the last several days about what I think, what my motives are, what I’ve done here, what I’ve done there, and now suddenly claims are being made about conversations which, if they took place, would take place probably in the privacy of the Clegg kitchen,’ he told LBC radio. ‘It’s total garbage, it is a complete work of fiction. Look, you can make up stuff about me, as indeed people do day in day out, have a go at me, but just don’t drag Miriam into it, don’t drag politicians’ families into it. That’s just not on.’ Nick Clegg (right) conceded 'alarm bells did not go off' within the party when allegations were made against former party chief executive Lord Rennard (left), who is threatening to sue the Lib Dems, several years ago . Mr Clegg yesterday admitted his handling of groping allegations against Lord Rennard last year was ‘not ideal’ as he vowed not to back down in calling for an apology from the Lib Dem peer. He also conceded that ‘alarm bells did not go off’ within the party when the allegations were first made several years ago. Former party chief executive Lord Rennard denies any wrongdoing and is threatening to sue the Lib Dems for suspending his membership after refusing to say sorry to his alleged victims.","Miriam Clegg denied involvement in a highly unusual public statement .
