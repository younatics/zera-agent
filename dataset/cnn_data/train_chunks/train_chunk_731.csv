Michelle Obama's ensuing 50th birthday party has already wreaked havoc for Hawaiian locals as security checkpoints have created traffic around Oprah Winfrey's home. The Queen of Talk is hosting the seminal birthday celebration for the First Lady, who stayed on in the Maui after President Obama and the girls returned to Washington following their Christmas vacation. Mrs Obama's birthday is on the 17th and the dance-heavy party will be held at Winfrey's mansion on the 18th, but that hasn't stopped problems from arising already. Ready to celebrate: Mrs Obama stayed behind in Hawaii (seen here on Christmas) after her family returned to Washington in order to celebrate her 50th birthday with friends at a blowout party hosted by Oprah Winfrey . Local shopkeepers have complained that the security roadblocks have stopped both customers and employees alike from getting to their stores. An unidentified worker at Grandma's Maui Coffee told TMZ that their colleagues have been running late to work while the owner of Goble's Flower Farm lamented that some customers couldn't come inside because of the roadblocks. For their part, the White House has made very few comments about the trip aside from saying that the time away from the White House and her children- while she does obviously love them- was a present from her husband. The party invitation made it clear that the First Lady isn't ditching all of her priorities as the healthy-living advocate will be serving little food and a lot of tunes at the shindig. Hideaway: Mrs Obama will spend her extra time as a guest of Oprah Winfrey at her mansion in Maui . Talk TV legend Oprah Winfrey will host the first lady for an unspecified number of days in her giant mansion on Maui, where the neighborhood has already become a chaotic mishmash of SWAT teams and security sweeps . Desperate for business: An unidentified worker at Grandma's Maui Coffee told TMZ that their colleagues have been running late to work due to security checkpoints . The event was described on the invite as having 'Snacks & Sips & Dancing & Dessert', according to The Chicago Tribune. The guest list has been kept under lock-and-key, but one talking head-turned-Obama friend couldn't keep quiet as Democratic strategist Donna Brazile told the paper that she was looking forward to the blowout and expects it to be as fun as the 2013 inauguration after party. 'We cleared the tables and we all just started dancing. We danced the night away. That's Michelle. She's spontaneous, she's energetic, she gets the moment and appreciates every second she is surrounded with friends and family,' Ms Brazile said. 'Sacred space': Oprah spent Christmas in Maui alongside her partner Stedman Graham (right), friend Gayle King (center left) and King's son William (left) The party is being held at Winfrey's home which she previously described as her 'sacred space'. Winfrey spent Christmas at the 11-room, 17-acre home and posted a picture of herself, longtime partner Stedman Graham, best friend Gayle King and King's son William on a hike that was topped off by a rainbow on December 27. 'Every evening we sit on the front porch and watch the greatest light show on earth: the sun dipping below the horizon,' Winfrey wrote about the home in Huffington Post Hawaii. 'Neighbors drop by. We sip drinks inspired by whatever is fresh and delicious-- mango, guava, pineapple, cucumber, basil.

Forsyth County Sheriff's Office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, has had the machine guns since the 1930s when they were donated by a local tobacco company. Reynolds Tobacco had used the weapons to protect their employees' cash on payday but then donated them when they changed payment methods.

Trade: Forsyth County Sheriff's Office, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, hopes to trade two Thompson vintage machine guns from the 1920s, pictured, in return for modern rifles . Chief Deputy Brad Stanley told the Winston-Salem Journal it is a good deal because the old Tommy guns can't be used by its officers while new rifles would help the force reach its goal of giving every officer a long gun, a sidearm and a Taser. County commissioners will vote on the trade next week. While the vintage weapons are commonly known as 'Tommy' guns, they are actually called the Thompson submachine gun after its inventor John T Thompson in 1918.

Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords has pleaded for patience in gun control on the third anniversary of a gun attack that left her fighting for her life and six people dead. The former Arizona congresswoman was among 13 people wounded in a January 2011 shooting outside a Tucson, Ariz., supermarket at the hands of gunman Jared Loughner. The Democrat resigned from Congress a year later. The 43-year-old, now the face of the national gun control effort, has endured three years of gruelling recovery after she was shot in the head, learning how to talk and walk again. Former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband  Mark Kelly. Today she pleaded for patience in gun control on the third anniversary of a gun attack that left her fighting for her life and six people dead . In an op-ed printed in the New York Times on the third anniversary of the assault, she likened her gun control fight to her time in recovery writing: 'Our fight is a lot more like my rehab. Every day, we must wake up resolved and determined. 'We’ll pay attention to the details; look for opportunities for progress, even when the pace is slow. Some progress may seem small, and we might wonder if the impact is enough, when the need is so urgent. ' But every day we will recruit a few more allies, talk to a few more elected officials, convince a few more voters. Some days the steps will come easily; we’ll feel the wind at our backs. Other times our knees will buckle. We’ll tire of the burden. I know this feeling. But we’ll persist. Safeguards: Former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (center) attended a gun show in Saratoga Springs, New York in October to show support for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's (left) system for making gun sales safer . 'We can get tough and win elections. We’ll support our allies. And those who stood in the way will face a powerful advocacy community standing between them and re-election. Ms Giffords is pro-gun ownership but anti-gun violence. In October Ms Giffords toured rows of . tables loaded with rifles and handguns today in her first visit to a gun . show since surviving the 2011 shooting. She . visited the Saratoga Springs Arms Fair with her astronaut husband, Mark . Kelly and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to highlight a . voluntary agreement that closely monitors gun show sales in New York.

Survivor: Gabrielle Giffords, pictured soon after the January 2011 shooting, suffered a gunshot wound to the head but survived . Ms Giffords,slowly walked hand-in-hand with Mr Kelly through the large room where Winchester rifles, muzzle-loaders, antique knives and other weapons were on display and 'Don't Tread on Me' flags hung from poles. They stopped at display tables, Mr Kelly asked dealers questions about the weapons, and Ms Giffords shook hands and smiled when people greeted her. 'Good to see you looking good!' some said. Gunman Jared Loughner shot Giffords in 2011 . Kelly bought a book on Colt revolvers, and said later he probably would have bought a gun if he had had more time. He said both he and his wife are gun owners. The . trio mixed with a gun show crowd that was mostly welcoming - with a few . hostile undertones before calling for people to build on the . cooperative effort. In June it was revealed Mr Kelly likes to do target practice with exactly the same kind of gun which was used to shoot her - as she cheers him on from their porch. The couple admit they still love the ‘gun culture’ and argue that their knowledge of guns gives them more credibility with the gun lobby and the National Rifle Association. They have made themselves strident gun campaigners and Giffords’ face is now on a huge billboard in New York’s Times Square asking for tougher checks on those buying firearms. Mr Kelly bought the assault rifle in March at a gun shop in Tucson to show how easy it was to buy such a weapon. But after his motives became public the shop owner refused to hand it over and gave him a refund, claiming that it was not for ‘personal use’ so he could not sell it. At the time, Todd Rathner, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association's affiliate in Arizona and a national NRA board member, questioned the point that Mr Kelly was trying to make. He said: ‘If you believe him, it's a cheap publicity stunt. If you don't, then he was speculating on the value of the rifle because he knew the prices would be inflated.’","Former Arizona congresswoman was shot in January 2011 in Arizona .

Football gatherings for the next several weeks may be cursed with lumpy cheese dips thanks to a shortage of smooth-melting party favorite Velveeta. Kraft Foods says they're running low on the American-style cheese product and the drought could continue for the next few weeks. That means millions of Americans planning their Super Bowl soirees could be facing a seriously cheesy conundrum. Smooth move: Kraft has announced there's a shortage of its popular, smooth-melting cheese product Velveeta just as demand ticks up for NFL playoffs and the Super Bowl . 'It is possible consumers may not be able to find some Velveeta products on store shelves over the next couple of weeks,' Kraft spokeswoman Jody Moore said Tuesday. Though not currently widespread, football playoffs and the impending Super Bowl on February 2 mean the shortage will affect more consumers than it would during other times of year. 'This is really a short-term issue that's more noticeable right now, given the increased seasonal demand,' Moore said. New of the impending processed . cheesepocalypse generated a minor tempest on Twitter after Advertising . Age reported a possible shortage, quoting an unnamed employee of an . unnamed Brooklyn-area grocery as saying that no further shipments were . expected until February due to 'a plant issue.' Kraft, . however, did not name the cause of the shortage and said only it is due . to the 'nature of manufacturing' and the ever more vague 'combination . of factors.' The conspicuous timing of the shortage, insists Kraft, is as much a thorn in the food behemoth's side as it is for dip lovers. 'Good cheese': Today host Matt Lauer showed solidarity with Velveeta lovers on Wednesday when he took a huge bite from a loaf, his first taste of Velveeta ever . Dippy: Demand for the popular ingredient in party cheese dips could top supply for weeks . No dip, bro? Sales of the process cheese food product best $500 million annually and the drought comes at peek demand . And it certainly isn't a ploy to encourage a nationwide dash to the super market for Velveeta. 'This is not a marketing/advertising campaign,' Moore said. Not everyone is convinced. 'It's . not a seasonal product,' culinary historian Ken Albala told USA Today. 'The whole point of Velveeta is you keep it on the shelf indefinitely. It's the cheese for people who don't know how to cook.' For the more adept chef, there's always good old cheddar. Not that anyone has complained about a dearth of the two-pound loaves yet. 'We have not heard many complaints from consumers so far,' Moore said. Kraft introduced the food it dubbed a 'pasteurized prepared cheese product' on June 2, 1928. The orange loaves were wrapped in foil and originally sold in wooden boxes. The company marketed the product as a smooth-melting, housewife-friendly alternative to traditional cheese that could be mixed with milk, melted, and poured 'over toasted sandwiches of peanut butter and sweet pickle relish.' Emil Frey, a Swiss immigrant who lived in Monroe, New York, is credited with creating the first version of Velveeta, which was a combination of whey leftover from the cheese-making process and cheese. Velveeta quickly became a hit in the United States and almost as quickly became so popular in Germany that the plant that produced it for the country was unable to meet demand just after its release there in 1937. Three years after Kraft brought the cheese product to market, the American Medical Association gave Velveeta its seal of approval. Velveeta now accounts for over $500 million of Kraft's annual sales and is sold worldwide. Velveeta does not require refrigeration on store shelves, where it can last for years.

Police have questioned an Iowa man who placed an antique coffin for sale on Craigslist which contained a full skeleton, for the bargain price of $12,000. Dave Burgstrum of Council Bluffs placed the coffin for sale in order to pay property taxes on a hall belonging to a now-defunct chapter of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Police noticed the unusual ad, inspected the remains and deemed it illegal to sell them. For sale: This appears to be the advertisement placed by Dave Burgstrum for the antique oak coffin - but there's no sign of the skeleton, which could have made for a nasty surprise for the buyer . According to Iowa law, without proper identification papers, human remains can not be legally sold. The bones were sent to Karen Foreman, chief investigator for the Pottawattamie County Medical Examiner’s Office, who examined the remains on Friday, reports The Daily Nonpareil. Foreman said the bones would be sent to the Iowa State Medical Examiner’s Laboratory to be examined by an anthropologist but that identification is extremely unlikely. If the bones are of Native American descent they will be returned to a Native American organization. Burgstrum placed the coffin and human remains up for sale with a succinct description: 'Oak coffin on stand' in an ad that's still live on Craigslist. He told The Daily Nonpareil that a local historian told him that the skeleton was donated to the organization by a local doctor after he retired in the 1880s. The Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF) is a global altruistic and benevolent fraternal organization that has its roots in British Oddfellows organizations of the 17th century which promotes helping others and personal and social development. The coffin itself dates to the 1900s, but Burgstrum can't explain how the bones came lay inside it. 'They were just there as long as anyone could remember,' he said. Odd: The Independent Order of Odd Fellows is a benevolent society with roots in 17th century Britain . Burgstrum told the Daily Nonpareil that the coffin was used in a ritual conducted by the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, which has a long history in Council Bluffs, beginning in 1852. Along with his brother Dan, Dave Burgstrum is a fifth-generation Odd Fellow, but said membership had dwindled in the last two decades leaving a large property tax on the hall and no donations to pay it. The hall, which is located in the 700 block of First Avenue, and Odd Fellows memorabilia, are in the care of Dave, Dan and Dave's wife Linda.","Dave Burgstrum of Council Bluffs put an antique coffin up for sale on Craigslist - but neglected to mention it already came with a skeleton .

A drowning boy was rescued by a group of beach-goers who formed a human chain to drag him from the powerful surf yesterday. Joshua McQuoid, 12, from Napier, New Zealand, was paddling when he was knocked off his feet and pulled into the sea by the strong undertow. His friend Hikiroa Ratapu raised the alarm but the current was so strong that rescuers, led by a German tourist and two policemen, were also repeatedly knocked down. Heroes: About a dozen people formed a human chain to pull a boy, 12, from the churning surf in New Zealand . It was only when about 12 passers-by . held hands to form a human chain that they were finally steady enough to . hold onto the schoolboy and pass him onto the beach at Napier's Marine . Parade. Joshua was unconscious when he was finally rescued from the water and was given first aid on the sand. He was then taken to Hawke's Bay Hospital and discharged later that day. Napier . Constable Paul Bailey told the Taranaki Daily News website that the boy . would have drowned if he had not been able to pass the child along the . human chain. He said at one stage Joshua became lost in the surf and had become a 'dead weight' through exhaustion. But the waves luckily knocked the schoolboy against Mr Bailey's legs and he was able to grab him. He told the website: 'Then we saw the human chain they'd formed and I was able to pass him over.' Rescue: Joshua McQuoid's friend Hikiroa Ratapu called for help when the schoolboy was dragged deeper into the sea and within seconds beach-goers rushed to the water to form a human chain . Life-saving: Constable Paul Bailey said Joshua became a 'dead weight' through exhaustion and could only get him to shore because of the human chain . Joshua said the water was only knee-deep and was surprised by how strong the waves were. He told Taranaki Daily News: 'It was really hard, it flipped me around heaps of times. I didn't know which way was up.' He told his father that the experience was like being inside a washing machine. Police said the boy was underwater for up to 20 seconds at a time as he was rolled over by the waves.

Twenty brand-new RAF Spitfires could soon reach for the sky following a deal reached with Burma yesterday. Experts believe they have discovered the locations of around 20 of the Second World War fighters buried at airfields around the country. David Cameron has secured an agreement that they will be returned to Britain. Historic: Spitfire pilots trudge through the mud at an advanced airbase in Burma after returning from sorties against the Japanese . Historians say the Spitfires were shipped out to Burma in the summer of 1945, two weeks before atomic bombs were dropped on Japan which brought the war to a sudden end. The British campaign to push the Japanese out of Burma was the longest and bloodiest of the war, beginning after the Japanese invaded in late 1941. Spitfires helped to support the Chindit special forces on the ground – and proved a huge boost to morale. They played a crucial role in defeating the enemy and covering the subsequent Allied advance through Burma, protecting the ground troops and providing vital supplies. Hidden: The Spitfire Mk II's were buried at airfields across Burma and a new deal could see them back in Britain . Historic moment: David Cameron meets with Burma's President Thein Sein after becoming the first British Prime Minister to visit Burma in 60 years, during which he secured the Spitfire deal . Historic: David Cameron said the important steps towards reform were 'important' Trip: A bare-foot David Cameron visits the Shwedagon pagoda after meeting with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi yesterday . But the Mark II Spitfires in the secret haul never saw action. Earl Mountbatten issued an order for them to be hidden in 1945 to prevent foreign forces from getting their hands on them as the British army demobilised. The aircraft, straight from the production line, were buried in crates at a depth of 4ft to 6ft to preserve them. Their whereabouts became lost after the RAF struck off their locations from their records. But aviation enthusiasts, aided by experts from the University of Leeds and a Second World War veteran who witnessed their burial, believe they have now discovered their locations using ground penetrating radar technology. Downing Street said the Government wants to unearth the aircraft and restore them to their former glory. The condition of the cargo boxes and aircraft, whose wings and body are buried separately, is unknown. But experts are hopeful that they are well preserved. A Downing Street source said that Mr Cameron had secured an agreement from the Burmese president to help Britain excavate the aircraft in a joint heritage project. ‘The Spitfire is arguably the most important plane in the history of aviation, playing a crucial role in the Second World War. ‘It is hoped this will be an opportunity to work with the reforming Burmese government to uncover, restore and display these fighter planes and get them gracing the skies of Britain once again,’ they said.","Historic planes buried in Second World War are to be shipped back to Britain after their mystery locations were discovered .

A bombshell report released Tuesday sheds new light on why authorities in Massachusetts have named former New England Patriots star - and accused killer - Aaron Hernandez a suspect in the 2012 double-murder of two men outside a Boston night club. The new developments - detailed in a search warrant released in Superior Court in Bristol - indicate that authorities believe that the June 17 murder of Odin Lloyd is in someway related to the double-murder of Daniel . Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were fatally shot outside of the Cure Lounge in Boston on July 16, 2012. According to the warrant, police say Hernandez and friend Alexander Bradley - who later sued Hernandez, claiming that he shot him in the face last February - were at the Cure Lounge on the night of the double-murder. Connection? Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing a semi-pro footballer in June, was allegedly in the same club as two men hours before they were murdered in a drive-by shooting in Boston in 2012 . Also at the club that night were Abreau and Furtado. It . previously has been reported that Hernandez and his friends fought with . Abreau, Furtado and their friends prior to the shooting. However, there . is no mention of an altercation between the two groups in the recently . released warrant, which was first obtained by the Hartford Courant. According . to the warrant, authorities believe Hernandez and Bradley were in a . silver SUV that circled the block outside of the Cure Lounge, apparently . waiting for Abreau and Furtado to leave. When . the men left with their friends about 2:30 a.m., the silver Toyota SUV . pulled up next to the gray BMW were in and someone opened fire. The warrant does not specify whether authorities think Hernandez was the trigger man. The . warrant explains that authorities reopened the case into the . double-murder after a detective investigating Lloyd's death - who also . investigated the murders of Abreau and Furtado - remembered seeing . Hernandez at the Cure Lounge while reviewing surveillance footage from . the club taken the night of the murders. Victims: Safiro Furtado, left, and Daniel Abreu, right, were killed after getting in an altercation in a club last year . Scene: The men were killed as they drove from the club with other friends on July 15, 2012 . Seized: Police took an SUV similar to one seen at the scene from Hernandez's uncle's house . Additionally, . authorities received an anonymous tip from an employee at the Rumor . nightclub - where Hernandez and Lloyd had been seen arguing two days . prior to Lloyd's murder - who claimed to have information indicating . that the Lloyd murder and the double-murder at the Cure Lounge were . related. According to . the warrant, Rumor security guard Sharif Hashem called the North . Attleborough police department on June 22 - just days after Lloyd's . murder - and said someone had 'accidentally spilled the beans' about the . connection between the three murders in front of him. The . combination of the tip and the detective's recollection of seeing . Hernandez at the club where Abreau and Furtado were murdered caused . authorities to reopen the investigation into the double-murder. Since . the case has been reopened, investigators have seized the murder weapon . in the double-homicide and Hernandez's silver Toyota SUV, which was . towed from a home in Bristol, Connecticut owned by Hernandez's uncle. The . investigation also uncovered other surveillance footage from the Cure . Lounge taken from the night of the double-murder that shows Hernandez . and Bradley entering the club immediately after the victims. According . to the warrant, Hernandez had two drinks and then left 10 minutes . later. Further, it shows Hernandez and Bradley leaving a parking garage . near the club in the silver Toyota SUV about 1:30 a.m. - about an hour . prior to the shooting - with Hernandez in the driver's seat and Bradley . sitting in the front passenger seat. It's . unclear what Hernandez and Bradley did next, but when Abreau and . Furtado left the club about an hour later, the silver Toyota SUV was . seen back in the area and captured by surveillance cameras at the . parking garage.

Promise: David Cameron has pledged to target cheap alcohol and put in a minimum price of 40p per unit . Campaigners have accused ministers of caving in to pressure from the drinks and supermarket industries to drop plans to impose a minimum price for alcohol. David Cameron had pledged to target cheap alcohol, saying a minimum price of 40p per unit could mean 50,000 fewer crimes and save 900 lives by the end of the decade. The Prime Minister even acknowledged the policy would not be popular, but insisted the responsibility of being in government meant doing ‘the right thing’ rather than the popular thing. However, the policy was abandoned in July, with the Government claiming there was not enough evidence minimum pricing would be effective without penalising responsible drinkers. Now an investigation has found industry lobbyists had at least 130 meetings with ministers and officials in the run-up to the u-turn and key evidence in favour of the policy had been suppressed. It revealed Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had met Asda’s chief executive Andy Clarke to discuss alternative measures that would not ‘burden’ their customers and ‘penalise the poor’. He also had a meeting with Tesco executives to discuss their concerns. Anna Soubry, who was then a health minister, had meetings with Heineken, the Wine and Spirit Trade Association and the British Beer and Pub Association – giving them a degree of access denied to public health activists. These three meetings were held after the end of a consultation period on the policy – when campaigners still thought it was going ahead. The investigation, by the British Medical Journal, claims ministers suppressed two reports that provided evidence that minimum unit prices would not penalise moderate drinkers or the poor. And it highlights the close relationship between alcohol companies and senior politicians; Chancellor George Osborne was handed an award by the all-party group on beer, while Treasury minister Sajid Javid had an ale named after him. Tory MP Sarah Wollaston said the revelations showed that ministers listened more to an industry worried about its profits than they did to experts in public health. ‘To my mind the alcohol industry has undue influence within Parliament,’ she said. ‘I was surprised to read about their level of access.’ Ministers held a public consultation last year asking at what level a minimum alcohol price should be set – 40p a unit, 45p or 50p. The consultation ended in February, but three months later Mr Hunt met Asda boss Mr Clarke after the supermarket contacted the Department of Health to request an opportunity to discuss alternatives to minimum pricing ‘that will encourage responsible alcohol use without penalising poorer families’. Briefing notes for Mr Hunt, seen by the BMJ, show that the Health Secretary was advised to say: ‘Government is still considering the issue. Could be open to alternative proposals from industry. Welcome Asda’s views on this.’ Two months later, the then Home Office . minister Jeremy Browne announced no minimum price would be set because . there was no ‘concrete evidence’ the plan would not penalise moderate . drinkers. But the BMJ . investigation found that there was such evidence, and that ministers . suppressed two reports from Sheffield University that undermined their . case for scrapping minimum pricing. Mr . Cameron’s change of heart sparked claims that he had been influenced by . his party’s election strategist, Australian lobbyist Lynton Crosby, . whose firm is reported to have represented drinks giants. Dr . Wollaston criticised ministers for putting pressure on Sheffield . University to delay publication of the two reports until after Mr . Browne’s statement. Discussions: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) met with Asda's chief executive Andy Clarke to talk about alternatives which would not 'burden' customers and 'penalise the poor' ‘The job of government is to put information in the public domain rather than asking Sheffield to withhold publication – and Sheffield should not have agreed,’ she said. Professor Ian Gilmore, special adviser on alcohol to the Royal College of Physicians, called on the Government to ‘stop dancing to the tune of the drinks industry and prioritise the health of the public’. A spokesman for the DoH said minimum unit pricing is still under consideration and ‘utterly rejected’ the allegation that anything untoward had happened in meetings with the alcohol industry. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘After the tobacco industry last year, these revelations raise yet more concerns about the influence of big business on this Government’s policies.’","Former health minister Anna Soubry met with Heineken to discus policy .

Clog-fighting, a mill town pastime, was used as a way of settling disputes - with men squaring up face-to-face to kick the unprotected shins of their opponents with their wooden, metal-soled clogs. In illegal duels, the loser was whoever gave up or was made to bleed first.

It was officially known across Greater Manchester and Lancashire as 'purring' and common in towns including Rochdale and Wigan. Clogging fights are believed to have started in the 1700s within mining communities and continued until around 1910. 'It was classed as a sport because, . although illegal, there were rules and fights would be held at specific . locations,' said Anna FC Smith, who has curated a new exhibition on clog fighting.

Ed Balls embraced the prospect of a Labour coalition with the Liberal Democrats yesterday by declaring that Nick Clegg was a man of ‘integrity’. In an apparent u-turn, the  shadow Chancellor said he understood why Mr Clegg went into government with the Conservatives and said they recently had a ‘very friendly and warm’ chat. Mr Balls’ intervention indicates that senior Labour figures are keen to open the door to a possible deal with the Lib Dems after the general election next year. Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls now says he could work with Nick Clegg, who claimed Mr Balls is the only politician he has a personal feud with . Thawing relations: Mr Clegg later posted a tweet saying only 'Ed Balls' - a reference to when the shadow sparked an internet phenomenon when by writing just his own name on Twitter . In an interview with the New . Statesman, he said: ‘I understand totally why Nick Clegg made the . decision that he made to go into coalition with the Conservatives. I may . not have liked it at the time, but I understood it.’ He added: ‘I can disagree with Nick Clegg on some of the things he did but I’ve no reason to doubt his integrity.’ Mr . Balls said he ‘had a nice chat’ with the Deputy Prime Minister recently . about how things were going. ‘The only conversation I’ve had with Nick . Clegg in the last 18 months was very friendly and warm,’ he said. His comments are significant because he has previously stated that he would not go into government with Mr Clegg. When the Tory/Lib Dem coalition was formed in 2010, senior figures in the Labour party were furious at what they saw as their natural allies on the left. Mr Balls repeatedly criticised the Lib Dems and Mr Clegg in particular, claiming his decision to do a deal with David Cameron’s Tories was ‘shocking’ and would make it ‘very difficult’ to work with him in future. But after the Labour lead in the polls halved to around six or seven points in 2013, senior party now accept that they could be faced with having to form a coalition in 2015. The move to so warmly embrace Mr Clegg . by one of Labour’s most factional figures will be viewed as a sign of a . lack of confidence that Ed Miliband can become Prime Minister with an . overall majority of his own. A senior Lib Dem source also played down the idea of a long-lasting rift: 'It's no secret that Ed Balls and Nick Clegg disagree about a number of issues. 'But it's also true that they get on when they speak to each other. They are both thick-skinned and capable of having a joke at each other's expense in the rough and tumble of politics. 'But ultimately, they are more than capable of a friendly chat when they bump into each other.' In a further sign of the thawing of relations, Mr Clegg later posted a tweet saying only 'Ed Balls' - a reference to when the shadow chancellor in April 2009 sparked an internet phenomenon when he wrote just his own name on Twitter. The much-mocked gaffe became such a hit that two years later Mr Balls repeated it to mark the second anniversary of 'Ed Balls Day'. Mr Balls, pictured in the Commons today, suggests Ed Miliband might not secure an overall majority in 2015 . November 2011'I don’t think there’s a single member of the shadow cabinet who’d find it easy to sit down with Nick Clegg. What Clegg did last year was so shocking'December 2011'I could serve in a Cabinet with Chris Huhne or Vince Cable tomorrow. I don't think it's possible for Nick Clegg to lead that move' September 2012'Ed and I are both clear Nick Clegg is an obstacle' January 2013‘I think what you always have to do is deal with politics as you find it. We’ve never, I don’t think, ever had a cross word.’ Before Christmas Mr Clegg claimed Mr Balls was the only politician he has a personal feud with. The Lib Dem leader said: ‘I always try to keep a good sense of humour, and if I have an argument with someone to keep the argument about what the argument is about and not allow it too often to become sort of personal. 'I make one exception, for a man named Ed Balls. But other than that I try not to make it about insults and stuff.' But in the latest interview Mr Balls brushed aside the criticism: ‘I saw that subsequently he made a further statement to one of the newspapers that these things weren’t about personalities, and I think he’s right about that.’ He added that he can ‘understand totally’ why Mr Clegg made the decision to go into coalition with the Tories. ‘I may not have liked it at the time, but I understood it. I also understood totally his decision to support a credible deficit reduction plan, because it was necessary in 2010.’ However he criticised the decision to accelerate the deficit reduction plane, cut the top rate tax cut and cut welfare. Mr Balls added: ‘I can disagree with Nick Clegg on some of the things he did but I’ve no reason to doubt his integrity, we’ve never, I don’t think, ever had a cross word.’","Shadow chancellor's in sharp reversal after condemning deal with Tories .

Water cannon will be ready for use on the streets of mainland Britain within months under controversial new plans. London Mayor Boris Johnson wants Britain's biggest police force to be armed with the fearsome weapon by the Summer. In the wake of the riots of August 2011, Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has been calling for officers to have access to the high-pressured cannon to quell possible future outbreaks of disorder. Controversial methods:The cannons have never been used on the streets of mainland Britain . But the Home Secretary Theresa May has refused to fund it as a 'national asset' for forces. Now Boris Johnson is pressing ahead with the scheme, telling the Home Secretary he is happy to fund the machines after receiving assurances from the Met Commissioner that they will be 'rarely used and rarely seen' only in the most extreme circumstances. Mr Johnson will hold talks with stakeholders, members of the public and the Police and Crime Committee of the London Assembly over the next few weeks before making a final decision next month. This week Mr Johnson wrote to Mrs May: 'Following briefing by the Commissioner I am broadly convinced of the value of having water cannon available to the Metropolitan Police Service for those circumstances where its absence would lead to either greater disorder or the use of more extreme force.' He added: 'Subject to the public engagement process that I have outlined above, I am happy to make the necessary funds available to the Metropolitan Police Service for the most economical interim solution that allows the Commissioner to meet his desire to prevent disorder on the streets.' Funding: Boris Johnson is pressing ahead with the scheme despite Home Secretary Theresa May's refusal to fund the cannons as a an 'asset' for forces around the country . Scotland Yard wants to take delivery of the cannon, which have never been used on the streets of mainland Britain, by the time of the third anniversary of the riots which laid waste to great swathes of the country. But the Home Secretary still has to decide whether to licence use of the machines. There are plans to buy three cannon from Germany at a cost of £30,000 each, that will then need to be modified for use on UK soil. Pleas: Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan Howe has called for the cannons to made available since the 2011 riots . The Met has approached companies about hiring or buying second-hand water cannons from overseas to have the machines available as soon as possible. The German-made Ziegler Wasserwerfer 9000 costs £1.3 million from new. Each machine holds 9,000 litres and is equipped with searchlights and CCTV cameras. Last year nearly 3,000 British police officers were trained how to work around the cannon before being deployed to Northern Ireland as part of the massive security operation for the G8 summit. The jets have been used in Northern Ireland for some time, but Sir Hugh Orde, head of the Association of Chief Police Officers, has spoken out against water cannon after deploying it while he was Chief of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The machines have caused serious injuries in the past, including to a German protester who was blinded in 2010. Yesterday London Assembly member Jenny Jones said: 'What happens if the Commissioner wants to deploy water cannon but the Mayor doesn't? Londoners need to know when and in what circumstances the Mayor would agree with the Met using this weapon. 'Allowing water cannon on the streets of London is a step in the wrong direction towards arming our police like a military force, and it goes against our great tradition of an unarmed police service. 'People have a democratic right to protest and my fear is that once the Mayor allows these weapons onto our streets we will see them being used against people exercising their legal right to protest.' Stephen Greenhaigh, Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime has now written to the London Assembly saying: 'In order to ensure that water cannon is available by next summer, something which the Commissioner has been calling for, it is important that this process of engagement starts soon. 'This will be based on the reassurance that the Commissioner has given that it will be ""rarely used and rarely seen"".' A spokeswoman for the Mayor's Office for Policing And Crime (MOPAC) added: 'Since the riots in August 2011 the police and the independent Inspectorate of Constabulary have argued that water cannon should be available as one of a range of tools to respond to serious public disorder.","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has called for their use since 2011 riots .

They dragged him from railings above Darling Harbour and spent an hour talking to him to calm him down. Dramatic ending: England cricketers Matt Prior and Stuart Broad stopped an English man from committing suicide by preventing him from jumping from a Sydney bridge in the early hours of Wednesday morning . Scene: The Pyrmont Bridge in Darling Harbour where Prior and Broad stumbled across an English man threatening to jump . The incident happened in the early . hours yesterday as the two players and the team’s security officer Terry . Minish were returning to their hotel from a fans’ charity event. Prior, . 31, is said to have spotted the man on the ledge of Pyrmont Bridge. He . had taken off his shoes and thrown his telephone, passport and wallet . into the water. After . starting a conversation with him, Prior and Mr Minish were forced into . action when the man looked as though he was about to jump to his death. Broad . and Prior then talked with the man, who told them he was from . Cheltenham, for almost an hour in a bid to calm him down while they . waited for the police to arrive. The players left . when police arrived. Prior said: 'We just did what anybody would do in that situation.

A motorist with poor eyesight who killed a pedestrian while not wearing glasses walked free from court yesterday. A judge said Mohammed Rashid, who ploughed into journalist Laurence Gunn  on a pedestrian crossing, had  not done anything illegal by failing to wear his glasses. The former law student is so short-sighted he could only read a registration plate seven feet away when police tested him. Laurence Gunn, 32, left, died after he was hit by a Ford Focus driven by Mohammed Rashid, 23.  Short-sighted Rashid, who admitted he wasn't wearing his glasses, was sentenced to just 140' hours community service . Mr Gunn was crossing the road in Hampstead, north London, with his dog, Misty, when he was hit by the car . But he received just 140 hours of community service for hitting Mr Gunn with his Ford Focus in March last year. Mr Gunn, 32, was hurled into the air as he crossed the road with a friend. He died of his injuries the following day. Rashid, 23, admitted to police that he had not worn his glasses for more than a year and didn’t know where they were. However, . sentencing him at Blackfriars Crown Court, Judge Aidan Marron QC said . that while Rashid should have been more ‘prudent’, he had not broken the . law by not wearing them. Mr Gunn, from Maida Vale, north west London, had been walking on Hampstead Heath with a friend . He . called the case ‘an unmitigated tragedy’, adding: ‘I’m afraid you were . the cause of the death. You were driving at a reasonable speed and the . evidence suggests there was nothing unusual on the road surface. ‘I . suggest we will never know why you did not see the victim. It would . have been desirable and prudent to wear specs. But there is nothing . unlawful about that.’ Rashid . denied causing death by dangerous driving at his trial in October, but . pleaded guilty  to the lesser charge of causing death by careless . driving. Judge Marron added: ‘You have made it perfectly clear from the outset that you are remorseful. ‘The only possible aggravating factor is the specs, and in evidence we heard they were not a legal requirement.’ He . sentenced Rashid to 140 hours’ unpaid work, a 12-month driving ban and . eight points on his licence. He also ordered him to pay £500 in costs. Rashid's lawyer told the judge at Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured, that the incident had 'freaked him out' His barrister, Jacqueline Vallejo, told the court Rashid was deeply affected by the incident. She said in mitigation: ‘Mr Rashid is not the same man as before, and for all intents and purposes he is a good lad. ‘Mr Rashid has left the University of East London in his second year, where he was studying law. ‘The . incident freaked him out and he is now working full time at . Sainsbury’s, but wants to start university again in September. But there . is no longer any hope of pursuing a career in law.’ The court heard Rashid had met his victim’s father. Miss . Vallejo said: ‘Mr Gunn’s father asked to meet with my  client and they . spoke for half an hour, and Mr Gunn bears no grudges. He is a dignified . but aggrieved man.’ Rashid was ordered to have 12 more meetings with Mr Gunn’s family as part of a restorative justice programme. Mr . Gunn, who lived in Maida Vale in north-west London, and his friend . Marsha Peterson had visited two pubs in Hampstead, North London, and . walked their dogs on Hampstead Heath on the day of the incident. They were on East Heath Road at 7pm when Rashid hit Mr Gunn as he and his dog Misty were using the crossing. Rashid . was not over the speed limit and had not been drinking. While it was . dark, the road was brightly lit, with a well-marked pedestrian crossing.","Laurence Gunn, 32, died after being hit by Mohammed Rashid's Ford Focus .

Dennis Rodman has admitted he had been drinking when he made offensive comments about captive American missionary, Kenneth Bae, during an interview with CNN. A day after the former basketball star sang 'Happy Birthday' to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and led a squad of former NBA players in a friendly game, Rodman issued an apologized through his publicist, claiming he had had 'a very stressful day.' 'I want to apologize,' Rodman said in an email to The Associated Press. 'I take full responsibility for my actions. It had been a very stressful day. Some of my teammates were leaving because of pressure from their families and business associates. 'My dreams of basketball diplomacy was quickly falling apart. I had been drinking. It's not an excuse but by the time the interview happened I was upset. I was overwhelmed. It's not an excuse, it's just the truth.' Best friends: A picture made available by the North Korean Central News Agency Wednesday shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, center, next to his wife Ri Sol-ju, left, talking to Dennis Rodman, right, retired Hall of Fame professional basketball player, while watching a friendly game between North Korean players and former NBA players at Pyongyang Indoor Stadium in Pyongyang, North Korea on Tuesday . He specifically apologized to Bae's family and added that he should 'know better than to make political statements.' 'I want to first apologize to Kenneth Bae's family,' he said. 'I want to apologize to my teammates and my management team. I also want to apologize to Chris Cuomo. I embarrassed a lot of people. I'm very sorry. At this point I should know better than to make political statements. I'm truly sorry.' Rodman has been slammed for not using his influence with Kim to help free Bae, the missionary in poor health who is being confined in the North for 'anti-state' crimes. On CNN on Tuesday, Rodman implied Bae was at fault. Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said his family couldn't believe what Rodman said. Posing: The dictator poses for pictures next to Rodman and the visiting American basketball team of former NBA stars before their game with the North Korean Hwaebul team at Pyongyang Indoor Stadium . All smiles: Kim Jong-un chats with Dennis Rodman as they prepare to watch the basketball game that took place Tuesday night . 'Here's somebody who is in a position to do some good for Kenneth and refuses to do so,' Chung told KOMO Radio in Seattle on Wednesday. 'And then after the fact, instead, he decides to hurl these unqualified accusations against Kenneth. It's clear he has no idea what he's talking about. I'm not sure who he's talking to, where he's getting his information, but he's certainly no authority on Kenneth Bae.' The U.S. State Department distanced itself from Rodman and said it did not want to 'dignify' his activities or comments in Pyongyang by commenting on them. But spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the department was open to speaking with Rodman on his return.'We have not reached out to him. We've said before, if he wants to reach out to us, we're happy to hear from him and what he has to say,' she told reporters. Training: Rodman, center, takes part in a practice session with North Korean basketball players and other former NBA stars in Pyongyang on Monday, January 7 . Rodman dedicated the game to his 'best friend' Kim, who along with his wife and other senior officials and their wives watched from a special seating area. The capacity crowd of about 14,000 at the Pyongyang Indoor Stadium clapped loudly as Rodman sang a verse from the birthday song. Rodman said he was honored to be able to play the game in the North Korean capital and called the event 'historic.' Some members of the U.S. Congress, the NBA and human rights groups, however, say he has become a public relations tool for North Korea's government. The government's poor human rights record and its threats to use nuclear weapons against rival South Korea and the United States have kept it a pariah state. Kim shocked the world in December by . having his uncle, once considered his mentor, executed after being . accused of a litany of crimes including corruption, womanizing, drug . abuse and attempting to seize power. In a TV interview Rodman appeared to suggest that Korean-American missionary Kenneth Bae was to blame for his captivity . Held captive: Kenneth Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said his family couldn't believe Rodman's comments during the CNN interview. The slurs suggested Bae, pictured, was at fault . The 52-year-old Rodman has refused to address those concerns while continuing to forge a relationship with Kim, whose age has never been officially disclosed. The government did not say how old he turned Wednesday but he is believed to be in his early 30s. At the start of the game, Rodman sang 'Happy Birthday' to Kim, who was seated above in the stands at the stadium, and then bowed deeply as North Korean players clapped. To keep it friendly, the Americans played against the North Koreans in the first half, but split up and merged teams for the second half. The North Korean team scored 47 points to 39 for the Americans before the teams were mixed. Rodman played only in the first half and then sat next to Kim during the second half. 'A lot of people have expressed different views about me and your leader, your marshal, and I take that as a compliment,' Rodman told the crowd. 'Yes, he is a great leader, he provides for his people here in this country and thank God the people here love the marshal.' Bizarre: Dennis Rodman sings Happy Birthday to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, seated above in the stands, before an exhibition basketball game in Pyongyang . Joy: North Koreans cheer at the start of an exhibition basketball game with U.S. and North Korean players . Rodman is the highest-profile American to meet Kim. He has carefully avoided getting involved in overtly political activities, saying that he is not a statesman and instead is seeking only to build cultural connections with the North through basketball that may help improve relations between Pyongyang and Washington. The game is a new milestone in Rodman's unusual relationship with Kim, who inherited power after the death of his father in late 2011 and rarely meets with foreigners. He remains a mystery to much of the outside world and until recently, his birthday was also not widely known, though it was quietly observed elsewhere around the capital Wednesday. Along with Rodman, the former NBA players included ex-All Stars Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson and Vin Baker. Also on the roster were Craig Hodges, Doug Christie, Charles D. Smith and four streetballers. Smith said he and the other players did not join Rodman in singing the birthday song. 'We always tell Dennis that he can't sing. He is tone deaf,' Smith said. 'He did it alone.'","Rodman has apologized a day after singing 'Happy Birthday' to the North Korean leader and leading a squad of former NBA players in a game .

Life on Mars doesn't seem so alien now that a team of scientists have set up a Martian camp in a U.S. desert. A team of experts have recreated life on the red planet by dressing up in space suits and living in isolation on a rocky desert in Utah. The researchers from the Mars Society live at a simulated base, surviving on food rations, conducting research experiments and showering just once every three days. Mars comes to Earth: A team of enthusiastic scientists are dressing in space suits and recreating life on Mars - in a red desert on Earth . Every time the team of four men and two women leave the Mars Desert Research Station they pass through an air lock. The cramped, two-storey hut is situated 40 miles from Hanksville, with the crew sleeping in small, coffin-like beds. The surrounding area slightly resembles geological and environmental conditions on Mars, in that it is hot, windy, largely red, and rocky. Researchers from the Mars Society live at a simulated Martian base, built with the help of space agency Nasa . The crew survive on food rations, conduct research experiments, and shower just once every three days . A British student was recently shortlisted for the job of repopulating the human race - on Mars. Ryan MacDonald, 20, beat more than 200,000 hopefuls to reach the final stages of selection for a one-way mission. The contest was part of the 'Mars One' project to establish a self-sustaining colony. It would see four people - two men and two women - take a five year flight into space. Mr MacDonald is now on the shortlist to join the first programme on Mars - which is 57 million miles away from Earth. The Mars One project was founded by Dutch entrepreneurs Bas Lansdorp and Arno Wielders, and aims to establish a permanent base on the planet by 2025. An initial appeal for volunteers last year gathered more than 200,000 responses. Contact with the outside world is strictly limited, with a very slow internet connection restricted to allow just a few emails in and out each day. Most communication is with 'mission control', who ask the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two-week shifts. That includes details on their food intake, exercise, and psychological status. Visitors have to travel to the MDRS on a buggy, down an unmarked path littered with boulders, at a speed of just 5mph. Mission commander Lara Vimercati, 27, who works as a Nasa biologist, said: 'We have to go through an airlock procedure and suit up before we have any contact with the outside. 'Everything we do each day must be as if we were on another planet. 'I'd like to be the first person to set foot on Mars but the first people up there will be engineers. You need to be able to fix things as they break. 'But I am a trained biologist, so maybe I'll be the first person to discover life on Mars.' The rest of the crew are all from science backgrounds, and realise two weeks at the base does not guarantee them a space on the first flight.

'You're miles from anywhere and you get to put on space suits and pretend you're on a different planet. Who wouldn't enjoy that? 'It's like a childhood dream come true.'

Scientists predict it will be 20 years before humans set foot on the planet, and those at the MDRS hope to be on that flight. They estimate the cost of the initial Mars landing to be £3.67billion, and every subsequent manned mission £2.45billion. Any crew that survives the journey will have to remain there for at least a year and a half, waiting for Mars and Earth to align properly for the trip back. During this time, they will supply their own oxygen, power, food, and water. The experiments being conducted at the MDRS and a sister station in the Arctic are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a trip.

A former drone operator who helped kill 1,626 targets says he's haunted by the carnage he witnessed from behind his computer screen. Brandon Bryant, 27, served as a drone operator from 2006 to 2011 at bases in Nevada, New Mexico and Iraq. It was a desk job of sorts, but unlike any other, it involved ordering unmanned aircraft to kill faraway targets while he watched. In an interview with NBC News' foreign correspondent Richard Engel, Bryant recalled one operation where his team fired two missiles from a drone at three men in Afghanistan. Scroll down for video . Difficult job: Brandon Bryant, 27, served as a drone operator from 2006 to 2011 at bases in Nevada, New Mexico and Iraq . Bryant recalled one operation where his team fired two missiles from a drone at three men in Afghanistan. He can't forget seeing the carnage of the victims . 'The guy that was running forward, he’s missing his right leg,' he said, recalling what he saw of the scene through the thermal images on his screen. 'And I watch this guy bleed out and, I mean, the blood is hot.' He recalled watching the mens' bodies grow cold, as slowly the red color detecting the heat of their bodies grew smaller. 'I can see every little pixel if I just close my eyes,' he said. Bryant is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after his five years as a drone operator. He said he sought help for the emotions he was experiencing on his job but 'one of the weird things about the whole drone community is you don't talk about anything that you've done. You just don't,' he told NPR. Bryant recalled to NBC when an Air Force recruiter told him that as a drone operator, 'he would be like the smart guys in the control room in a James Bond movie.' But that wasn't the case. He said he . began feeling paranoid that he was killing innocent people, not Taliban . insurgents. And he felt that it wasn't his place to question the people . giving him orders to launch the missile attacks. Deadly machines: Two Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton unmanned aerial vehicles are seen on the tarmac at a Northrop Grumman test facility in Palmdale, California . According to reports by NBC and McClatchy newspapers, Bryant's paranoia may not be unfounded. NBC reported Thursday that the CIA does not know the identity of a quarter of those killed in drone strikes in Pakistan. McClatchy's Jonathan S. Landay has also reported that at least 265 of up to 482 people who were killed by drones during a 12-month period ending September 2011 were not senior al Qaida leaders but instead were 'assessed' as unknown extremists. The reports add to growing scrutiny of President Obama's increased reliance on unmanned aircraft. The Air Force now has roughly 1,300 drone operators, which is four times what it had in 2008. As the drone program grows, researchers are beginning to delve into the psychological effects of remotely-controlled warfare. A  recent study by Defense Department researchers found that the prevalence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder among drone operators is equal to that of deployed pilots. 'Remotely piloted aircraft pilots may stare at the same piece of ground for days,' Jean Lin Otto, co-author of the study, told the New York Times. 'They witness the carnage. Manned aircraft pilots don’t do that. They get out of there as soon as possible.' President Obama's increasing reliance on unmanned aircraft has come under fire on Capitol Hill . Based on his commander's count, Bryant helped kill 1,626 people during his time as a drone operator. He is now retired from the Air Force and has returned to his home in Montana, where he is haunted by that number and the images of carnage that he saw. 'I don’t feel like I can really interact with that average, everyday person,' he told NBC. 'I get too frustrated, because A, they don't realize what's going on over there. And B, they don't care.'","Brandon Bryant, 27, served as a drone operator from 2006 to 2011 at bases in Nevada, New Mexico and Iraq .

A motorist who hit and killed a delivery man has walked free from court after claiming he was dazzled by the sun shining in his eyes. Phillip White, 52, was accused of being 'on automatic pilot' when he hit Nigel Gutteridge, 61, as he unloaded wood from his lorry, pinning him against the back doors. White, who lives just yards from the accident in Tiverton, Devon, was driving to work at the time and claimed to be travelling at 25 miles an hour, despite his van being found in fourth gear. Not guilty: White collapsed in the dock after being found not guilty today at Exeter Crown Court . During the trial Mr Richard Crabb, prosecuting, asked him: 'You were on automatic pilot, making a journey you have done many times before?' He said: 'I had seen the sun shining down the road before but never as bright as that morning. I had never known it that bright before. 'I put my visor down but can't remember where I was when I did so. I have asked myself a thousand times why I didn't see the lorry, but I never saw it. 'I got into my van that morning, got out onto the road and I hit the lorry. That is all I can remember. 'I don't know. I'm sorry. I never saw the lorry until I hit it.' The jury also heard evidence from PC Philip Rowan-Smith who said he had recreated the journey the next day and found that he had to slow down due to bright sunshine. The prosecution argued that if White had been blinded then he should also have slowed down, but no tyre marks were found at the scene and witnesses said they had not seen White use his brakes. Prosecutor Richard Crabb said: 'Witnesses don't describe seeing any braking or swerving. He said he had been blinded by the sunlight, which was rising in the east in front of him. 'He had driven the road a thousand times and he must appreciate that the sun might be a problem at that time in the morning. 'He should have seen the lorry and driven around it and if he was dazzled by the sun, he should have slowed down.' Fatal: Mr White hit Mr Gutteridge just off of Lea Road after leaving his house on Barle Court for work. Mr Gutteridge died instantly when he was pinned to the back of his lorry . Mr Gutteridge, from Thelbridge Cross, in Witheridge, was a former director of a tool hire firm and was semi-retired, only working for the deliver company part-time. Gutteridge had just got out of his cab on April 10 2012 to start unloading his lorry when he was hit and died instantly. White collapsed in the dock of Exeter Crown Court today as the not guilty verdict was read out by the jury. Judge Phillip Wassall said: 'This is a tragic event whereby a man lost his life. My sympathies go to Mr Gutteridge's family.' The case is not the only one in which a driver has pleaded not guilty, claiming the sun was in their eyes. In November last year a jury failed to reach a verdict in the trial of 22-year-old Lauren Paul, from Hampshire, who killed lollipop man Raymond Elsmore as he was escorting a pregnant woman across the road. Mr Elsmore died of head and chest injuries after being hit by Ms Paul at 3pm on December 5, 2012. Ms Paul claimed she had been blinded by sunlight at the time and that she was also trying to clear condensation from her front window. The prosecution have asked for a retrial at a date yet to be fixed.","Phillip White, 52, found not guilty of death by dangerous driving .

Arrested: Donald Preston Ferguson, 52, has been charged over the sexual assault and murder of a seven-year-old girl in 1990 . A 52-year-old man has been charged over the sexual assault and strangulation of a little girl whose battered body was found dumped behind a North Carolina elementary school more than 20 years ago. Donald Preston Ferguson was arrested at his Spartanburg, South Carolina home yesterday and charged with first-degree murder and sexual assault. Police said advances in forensic technology enabled them to link Ferguson to the horrific 23-year-old cold case which rocked Greensboro, Fox 8 Carolina reported. In July 1990, the body of seven-year-old Shalonda Poole was found in the woods behind Jones Elementary School, a day after she went missing. Shalonda's tiny body showed signs of strangulation and rape. Shalonda's family said they had never given up hope the little girl's killer would be found. 'They said it's official. We got her killer,' Shalonda's mother Marilyn Poole said, according to Fox 8 Carolina. 'I had dreamed that this day was going to come. I have walked these floors crying out loud...He took my heart and cut it up.' Poole said her family had known Ferguson, who worked occasionally near Shalonda's school, about a month before the girl's death. Ferguson had sat at the kitchen table in the girl’s home and played cards with Shalonda's parents just days before her death, according to News & Record. Shalonda's father Gattis Poole is still furious: 'I just want to get my hands on him.' Heartbreaking: The battered body of Shalonda Poole, seven, was found near a North Carolina elementary school in July 1990 . Greensboro Police Department spokesman, Captain Mike Richey, told News & Record officers never stopped looking for Shalonda's killer. He said numerous detectives have questioned hundreds of people over the grisly murder. 'This case has galvanized the attention of officers and the public alike,' he said. 'Some of our most grizzled veterans were on the scene and to this day, it still affects them.' Days after Shalonda's body was found, police arrested Melvin Bennett, a cafeteria worker. The mentally disabled man was found not-guilty two years later. Scene: Shalonda's body was found in a wooded area near Jones Elementary School, North Carolina (pictured) in 1990 . Hopeful: Shalonda's mother, Marilyn Poole, said she had never given up hope her daughter's killer would be found . In 2007, Detective A.R. Hinson began . reviewing the case file and, using information obtained from an . interview, was led to Ferguson. Police said Ferguson was 29 when Shalonda was reported missing from her family’s Hampton Homes residence. He left the Greensboro area a month after Shalonda was killed. In October 1990, he was charged with and convicted of a sexual assault in Spartanburg and was released in 1997. Ferguson was on probation when he was arrested yesterday. He is in the Spartanburg County jail pending extradition to Greensboro. A Spartanburg County judge denied Ferguson bond early this morning. Police said advances in forensics technology resulted in the arrest, with officers keying in on a person interviewed early in the investigation. Without elaborating on the process, officers were able to develop enough probable cause in the past few weeks to make an arrest. Marilyn Poole said the arrest would provide some closure for her family. Shalonda would have been 31-years-old today. She remembers explaining to Shalonda's twin sister at the time that the little girl was not coming home. 'She . used to ask me all the time, ‘Where is my sister?’ ' Poole said.

Molestation charges: The father-of-two is accused of sexually abusing her in his Wyckoff, New Jersey, home when she was four years old . 'Weronika told me to say those things,' she told the court according to the paper. She also claimed that the babysitter threatened her brother and made the children clean the house top to bottom. However, according to NorthJersey.com, prosecutors said the girl revealed in October 2010 that she had been touched by Leaf. She had told her babysitter in detail . that Leaf had touched her in her private parts and said Leaf told her . not to tell anyone, according to prosecutors. Star reporter: Leaf was once an investigative reporter for Fox 5, during which he won two Emmy Awards . In happier times: Leaf, 43, and his wife Monica, right. The couple have two children . The babysitter contacted a family friend who then contacted authorities. Leaf was arrested on October 7, 2010, after the girl told investigators during an interview that he engaged in sexual acts with her, the assistant prosecutor, Kenneth Ralph, said. Monica Leaf, the child’s mother, went on . TV three years ago, claiming Leaf had been set up by the nanny, who . also is expected to testify. She said the nanny got the girl to lie about being molested, according to the video published on CBS News.

The senior vice-president of a legal insurance company is suing Google over her corporate photo and mocking comments that were published on a satirical website. SexyExecs.blogspot.com is a Google-hosted blog that takes company headshots of business executives and adds humorous, sometimes offensive, commentary. Ann Dieleman, Chief Marketing and Business Development Officer at ARAG North America, filed a lawsuit against Google last week over the photo that they say the internet giant has refused to take down. Unfair: Ann Dieleman and her company, have filed a copyright suit over this post on a blog hosted by Google . Dieleman's picture appeared on the site in December 2009, with critical comments about her appearance and gums. The posting added: 'Sadly, Ann doesnt hold up to the sort of advanced, high levels of scrutiny people are subjected to these days. It's not us doing this, it's celebrity-obsessed media culture. Blame Heat magazine.' Challenge: Ann Dieleman says she is asserting her legal rights and Google have refused to remove the offending picture . ARAG, based in Des Moines, and Dieleman say they have tried and failed to get Google to take down the picture - so they took out a copyright suit against the company on December 31, 2013. 'We've followed the appropriate procedures to remove the content. 'However, after continued back and forth it was time to assert my legal rights,' Dieleman said, reported by the Des Moines Register. 'Given I've spent the majority of my . career educating and empowering people to protect their rights, I didn't . feel it would be right to ignore protection of my own when this . situation arose,' she continued. Dieleman and her company, both named in last week's suit, claim that the site invited unfavorable comments on the picture. They say they informed Google in September 2012 that SexyExecs' use of the corporate photo infringed their copyright. According to the court documents, Google responded later that month saying they had decided not to remove the content. 'As always, we encourage you to resolve any disputes directly with the . blogger in question,' Google emailed back, as stated in the suit. But Dieleman and ARAG have continued with legal proceedings. Target: Kevin Cooney, Corporate Vice President & Chief Information Officer at Xilinx, also gets the treatment. Underneath his photo it reads: False teeth? Eyes look suspicious as well.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 02:12 EST, 9 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:00 EST, 9 January 2014 . A researcher says she has uncovered vital testimony from a U.S. officer who in 1943 was forced by the Nazis to watch as they exhumed thousands of Polish officers killed on Soviet leader Josef Stalin's orders. At a news conference Wednesday in Warsaw, U.S. researcher Krystyna Piorkowska said she found the Paris-dated May 10, 1945, testimony of former American prisoner of war Lt. Col. John H. Van Vliet Jr. in the U.S. National Archives near Washington last November. It was filed among other unrelated World War II documents from the U.S. Embassy in Paris. The sworn deposition provides evidence of Soviet responsibility for the 1940 massacre of some 22,000 Polish officers in the Katyn forest and other places in what was then the Soviet Union. The Soviet Red Army had taken the Polish officers prisoner after invading eastern Poland in September 1939. Warning: Graphic content . New testimony: U.S. researcher Krystyna Piorkowska found U.S. John H Van Vliet's testimony from 1945 (above). In the statement he says he watched the Nazis exhume the bodies of some 3,500 Polish soldiers who were killed under the orders of Stalin while he was living as a German prisoner of war. Another report that Van Vliet made a few days later in Washington is considered missing. This has fueled speculation that the U.S. government helped cover up Soviet responsibility for the massacre out of fear that saying the truth would anger Stalin, whom the Allies were counting on to help them defeat Germany and Japan in World War II. For decades, Moscow had blamed the Nazis for the massacre, but then in 1990 admitted that Stalin had ordered it. The massacre further embittered Poland's relations with Moscow, which has refused to consider the massacre a genocide and has been reluctant to prosecute any living henchmen. Van Vliet was a POW in Germany when he was taken to Katyn to see the evidence. Gruesome: Officials exhume the bodies buried in a mass grave in Katyn forest . Thousands of soldiers: According to Van Vliet's testimony, the bodies were all wearing Polish uniforms . In the document that Piorkowska found, Van Vliet tells an interrogating U.S. officer that he saw the exhumation of some 3,500 corpses in tailor-made, little-worn Polish uniforms. They were all killed with a shot to the back of the head. Responsibility: For years' Moscow denied part in the Katyn massacre, but eventually pinned the order on Stalin in 1990 . He said the 'decomposition of the corpses and the nature of the undergrowth undisturbed' on the graves indicated they must have remained there 'over a year - possibly three or four.' 'The belongings removed from the corpses all indicated death in the months of February, March or April, 1940,' Van Vliet said. The area was under Soviet control then. Germany's Nazi regime discovered the graves in early 1943 after invading parts of the Soviet Union. The report by Van Vliet named other Allied POWs who witnessed the exhumation with him. Some of the names were not known previously to Polish historians. Piorkowska told The Associated Press that the deposition was a signal to 'go on searching, that there are still more documents to be found.' 'This offers new names and suggestions of where to seek new evidence,' she said, adding that she was seeking to get in touch with the other POWs' families. Van Vliet made a new report in 1950 to help a U.S. investigation of the Katyn massacre. That document is available but is considered less valuable because of its distance in time from the actual event.","U.S. researcher Krystyna Piorkowska found testimony from U.S. Lt Col John H Val Vliet from May 1945 .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:21 EST, 8 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:14 EST, 8 January 2014 . The Hawaiian island of Oahu is facing a huge dilemma - protect the homes of its residents and risk famous surfing beaches or abandon the coastal houses to the whims of the rising waters. The high Christmas swell damaged at least . five oceanfront properties in the neighborhood, rekindling a decades-old . debate about how best the state and homeowners should respond to beach . erosion and the increasingly threatening Pacific Ocean. Some property owners want to be able to install a seawall or something similar to protect their property. Rising tide: Sandbags are piled up in front of properties damaged by severe beach erosion in Oahu's North Shore in Hawaii. Residents are revisiting the debate over saving their homes or the beach . Battle: 'We will endure' is scrawled on the wall of a house damaged by beach erosion. Experts warn that building a sea wall would damage the world-famous beaches instead . Location: Rocky Point is at the mercy of the rising waters of the Pacific Ocean . Doing . so, scientists say, could lead the sand on the nearby coastline - . including Sunset Beach, home to some of the world's top surfing contests . - to disappear. 'Do . you build a seawall and potentially condemn the beach to extinction in . front of the seawall but at the same time buy a lot of time for . homeowners on the nearby land to figure out how to move away from that . situation?' asked Chip Fletcher, a University of Hawaii coastal . geologist. 'Or do you not build a seawall, condemning the homes and the developed land to extinction, but allow the beach to survive?' Fletcher said building seawalls always comes to mind wherever severe erosion occurs. He . said studies show seawalls built on chronically eroding shorelines like . Sunset Beach will only lead to more erosion down the coast. Fletcher noted that other Oahu communities have already lost large chunks of beach because of seawalls. These are stark options for Sunset . Beach, where multimillion-dollar homes line the shore and where the . globe's top surfers converge each year for the World Cup of Surfing. Wild waters: The high Christmas swell damaged at least five oceanfront properties in the neighborhood . Defenses: Sandbags are piled up in front of this damaged home . Resident Alice Lunt didn't worry too much when she saw waves splashing close to her home on Oahu's North Shore on Christmas Eve. She had seen the ocean edge close before. But before dawn, a neighbor woke her with a call. 'Everything was washing away,' she remembered the neighbor saying. The . water claimed Lunt's deck that day, and washed away a concrete slab the . next night - part of a fast-moving collapse of the shore that also . ripped out a neighbor's backyard and forced another to cut away rooms to . save the rest of their house. Property owners wanting to build a seawall would need to draft an environmental study and get a state permit, a process that could take months. In the short-term, they may receive emergency authorization to place sandbags and tarp in front of their properties to deflect the waves, said Sam Lemmo, the coastal lands office administrator. Krystle Dombrowski, whose family owns two houses next to Lunt's that they rent to vacationers, her husband, Kenneth, some friends and volunteers ran out of burlap sacks and had to buy all the pillowcases at Wal-Mart and made bright orange, red and polka dot sandbags. 'We need something that's structurally sound, something that is really big, that can help us,' she said. Large surf that regularly hits the North Shore each winter brought the Christmas swell, not a freak storm. Lunt said the beach fronting her home . was particularly narrow because swells from the north that usually . deposit sand during the summer weren't as frequent and westerly swells . had taken away sand instead. West and northwest swells have continued to carry away sand this winter, she said. But more fundamental factors are also at play. One is that sea levels have been rising for years, pushing the ocean inland. Attraction: The North Shore on Oahu in Hawaii brings in the globe's top surfers each year for the World Cup of Surfing . Another is that the Sunset coastline is chronically eroding, just like 70 percent of the beaches on Oahu, Maui and Kauai islands. In the long term, both Lemmo and Fletcher believe government agencies should encourage people to move away from the coast to eliminate the question of whether seawalls should be built. 'We need to accommodate the erosion, allow it to occur, and we need to move away from it so it doesn't affect our lives,' Lemmo said. One option would be for a land conservation fund to buy properties along key shorelines and turn these areas into public parks, Fletcher said. In Hawaii, the counties decide how far back from the coast dwellings may be built. On Oahu, people may only build homes 40 feet from the shoreline. Kauai and Maui counties, however, have adopted tighter rules in recognition of the erosion creeping up on their coastlines. But even this may not be far enough, Fletcher said, noting these setbacks still allow buildings right on the sand dunes. Construction may need to be 150 feet from the shoreline to get away from the dunes, he said. Rocky Point homes, like many of Hawaii's coastal homes, were built on dunes that would now be feeding the beach with sand if they didn't have structures on them. The two-mile stretch of coastline from Sunset Point to Pupukea Beach Park was subdivided in the 1920s, according to 'Beaches of Oahu' by John R. K. Clark. Danger: These desirable homes are at serious risk from rising waters and beach erosion . That was a time when scientists didn't know as much about sand dunes. The outlines of dunes are still visible in the rise and fall of pavement on the narrow road next to Lunt's home. Erosion like this will likely recur, Fletcher said, as sea levels rise and as climate change causes sea levels to rise even faster. This is especially true, he said, in places where sand dunes have been landscaped out of existence or are locked up by development. 'The event on the North Shore is a warning for all of us in Hawaii that these sorts of occurrences are part of our future,' he said.","At least .

The suit refers to the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment, in which the Justice Department said Juggalos were a loosely organized hybrid gang.

Accident: State representative Leslie Combs was cleaning her gun when it went off in her office on Tuesday afternoon . A state representative in Kentucky caused a security scare when she accidentally fired her gun while cleaning it in her office at the state legislature. But Leslie Combs has brushed off the accident, claiming that it comes with the territory of gun ownership. 'I'm a gun owner. It happens,' she said today after news of yesterday's accident broke. The Democratic representative was cleaning her semi-automatic handgun inside her office when it accidentally fired and a bullet ricocheted, hitting a bookshelf. Local station WHAS 11 reports that a colleague, representative Jeff Greer, was also in the room at the time of the accident but neither of them were injured. 'I was purposely disarming it to put it up because I didn’t like it and I didn’t want to use it any more,' she said. 'I had had it in my purse I carry usually, and I thought ""I’m going to put that sucker away.""' State police Sgt. Jason Palmer told The Courier Journal that the single bullet was fired at 2.30pm on Tuesday and was reported to police two hours later. The investigation has been concluded and they found no suspicious evidence to suggest that it was anything beyond an accident, nor did they find any fragments outside of the office. Though guns are not allowed inside many government buildings, the law that put that in place in Kentucky expired in 2003 and since Ms Combs has a concealed weapons permit, she did nothing wrong by having it with her. Government property: An earlier law banning guns from the Kentucky State Capitol expired in 2003 . Legal: Ms Combs has a conceal-carry license meaning she did nothing illegal by having the gun in her office . Fellow state senator Mary Lou Marzian proposed legislation to ban guns from the building 'several years ago, and it did not meet with success,' she told the Courier-Journal. 'I’m certainly not wanting to take guns away from people, but maybe keep them in our cars if people have them to not bring them around to where there are going to be children walking up around the halls,' Ms Marzian said. Ms Combs also maintains that she is a strong supporter of gun rights. 'I obtained my concealed-carry permit several years ago to better protect my safety, as I travel widely and sometimes at night. I strongly support our Second Amendment rights and our state’s concealed-carry law, and believe just as strongly that gun safety and education must be part of that equation,' she wrote in a post on Facebook addressing the incident. 'I urge everyone to be extremely cautious with their firearm. I know from personal experience how easy it is to discharge a firearm accidentally.","State Rep.

Mystery man: Sufian bin Qumu, 54, is believed to have been involved in the Benghazi attack on the American consulate in 2012, years after he was released from Guantanamo Bay prison . A prisoner that was released from Guantanamo Bay is now the leader of a terror group and new reports reveal that he led his men to participate in the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi. The Washington Post reports that it is still unclear whether or not Abu Sufian bin Qumu was the one to plan the attack or if he just happened to be in Benghazi when they decided to join in the raid. Qumu, 54, is now the head of a group called Ansar al-Sharia which is based out of Darnah, a town several hours from the Libyan capital of Benghazi. Ansar al-Sharia has not yet been formally labeled as a foreign terrorist organization, but The Washington Post tells that the State Department will be announcing that new title to the branches in Tunisia and Libya, including the one headed by Qumu in Darnah. This is not the first time that Qumu's name has been tied to the Benghazi assault as Fox News initially reported an alleged connection in an article less than two weeks after the attack. This partial confirmation- at least that he was connected if not leading the assault- comes as a blow to former President George W. Bush's record on the fight against terrorism. One of the hundreds: While at Guantanamo Bay, Qumu was referred to as Prisoner 557 (stock photo used) Lingering questions: It remains unclear what level of involvement Qumu and his terrorist group played in the attack that left four dead; the State Department is still trying to investigate and arrest suspects . The Republican President was the head of the American charge against al Qaeda following the terrorist attack on September 11 but the decision to free this particular man- known during his time in Guantanamo as Prisoner 557- will undoubtedly raise other questions. Victim: American Ambassador Chris Stevens was one of four people killed during the attack . Qumu began his fighting career when he drove tanks for the Libyan army and then spent 10 years in prison for an undisclosed charge. Following his release, he moved to Egypt then Afghanistan. There he became connected to al Qaeda and was trained in a camp run by Osama bin Laden in 1993, according to files released by WikiLeaks. He worked with and for bin Laden in Sudan and then Pakistan, where he was eventually arrested and turned over to American forces. The files stated that Qumu had 'long-term association with Islamic extremist jihad and members of al-Qaida and other extremist groups' and 'detainee’s alias is found on a list of probable al-Qaida personnel receiving monthly stipends'. The reports also noted that his medical files from Guantanamo described him as having a personality disorder and untreated tuberculosis. Qumu was released from Guantanamo Bay in 2007 by President Bush who approved the order to have him transferred back to Libyan authorities after then-leader Moammar Gaddafi. The timeline differs here according to different sources, but The Washington Post reports that he was released from a Libyan jail a year later in 2008 while others say that Qumu was one of 38 prisoners released from the notorious Abu Salim prison in 2010 in celebration of his 41st year in power. Either scenario gave the former Guantanamo detainee enough time to start re-climbing the terrorist ladder before the September 11, 2012 attack on the American consulate that left Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others dead.","Abu Sufian bin Qumu, 54, is now the head of a terrorist group in Libya but was released from Guantanamo Bay prison in 2007 .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:11 EST, 8 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:12 EST, 8 January 2014 . Weddings have been put on hold in Utah after the U.S. Supreme Court halted same-sex marriages while the Denver court of appeals rules on whether the couples have the right to wed. The temporary halt on same-sex marriages means many couples who obtained their license but had not yet held their ceremony have been forced to put their plans on hold. It is not yet known how many have been affected by the suspension of the law on same-sex marriages, but more than 1,000 couples had taken home marriage licenses in the past two weeks. On hold: Jon Jensen, left, and Jared Reesor, leave the clerk's office last month after it canceled a special Saturday opening to issue marriage licenses. Same-sex couples who have marriage licenses are not able to hold their ceremony after a Supreme Court ruling . Today Governor Gary Herbert issued guidance to state agencies . instructing them not to recognize same-sex marriages that took place . during the two weeks. 'State . recognition of same-sex marital status is on hold until further . notice,' the guidance states. 'Please understand this position is not . intended to comment on the legal status of those same-sex marriages - . that is for the courts to decide.' But Mr Herbert's office also said benefits obtained by the newlyweds during the two weeks should not be revoked. For instance, if a couple changed . their names on a driver's license already, that license should not be . revoked, Mr Herbert said. But, . since all the laws revert back to before the federal judge's December . 20 ruling, couples trying to change their name now on a driver's license . will not be allowed to do so, he said. Utah . Attorney-General Sean Reyes issued his own statement, saying the . validity of the 1,000-plus marriages performed is in question, and . dependent on the decision of the appeals court. One couple who have been forced to put their plans on hold is Michael Mathie and Tyler McCraley, who collected their license on December 26. Unlike many couples who solemnized their vows in impromptu ceremonies in the lobby of county clerks offices, Mr Mathie and Mr McCraley decided to wait so Mr Mathie's two children could be involved. They had planned to hold their ceremony this weekend, but they waited too long. Ceremonies have been put on hold while the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considers the long-term question of whether gay couples have a right to wed in Utah. Delay: Tyler McCraley, left, and Michael Mathie collected a marriage license on December 26 but delayed their ceremony so family could attend. Now they don't know if they will be able to go ahead with their plans . Joy: Cheryl Haws, right and Shelly Eyre pose with their marriage license. More than 1,000 were issued in the past two weeks but a court has now halted same-sex marriages . The ruling means couples who have not . already solemnized the marriage won't be considered legally wed, Salt . Lake County Clerk Sherrie Swensen said. A marriage license itself means nothing unless there is a ceremony with an officiator and two witnesses, she said. 'We were totally devastated. The biggest push for us to get married is to show the kids we were in this for the long haul. We definitely wanted them to be a part of it,' Mr McCraley said. County clerks have yet to tabulate how many same-sex couples who obtained licenses failed to make their unions official, but Megan Risbon of the Utah Pride Center estimates a couple of hundred people may fall into this category. The uncertainty surrounding the marriages is emblematic of the confusion resonating throughout Utah after a two-week rush on same-sex marriages was brought to a sudden halt. Questions remain about taxes, adoptions and health insurance for the newly married couples. 'The legal landscape is changing by the minute,' attorney Laura Milliken Gray, who represents many same-sex couples, said. 'We're trying to figure out exactly what it means in an area where everything is unprecedented.' Review: The Supreme Court has halted same-sex marriages while a court of appeals debates whether they can go ahead in Utah . Governor Herbert's guidance drew rebukes from attorneys representing three same-sex couples who brought the lawsuit that led to the federal judge's decision and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah. They believe the marriages are valid, and that the couples should be able to get benefits bestowed upon any married couple. 'Regardless of how the state believes the 10th Circuit will ultimately rule, these couples are legally married and the state should treat them accordingly,' attorney Peggy Tomsic said in a statement. Mr McCraley, 32, said the past three weeks have triggered a roller coaster of emotions for him and other gay and lesbian couples. First was the joy and shock that a federal judge overturned Utah's same-sex marriage ban. That was followed by the excitement of planning a wedding: renting tuxedos, ordering flowers and having a friend open her house for the event. Then came the disappointment on Monday morning of finding out about the Supreme Court ruling and canceling their wedding ceremony in which 50 people were going to attend. Now, they don't know when, or if, they'll ever get married in Utah. 'We're just waiting to see what happens,' Mr McCraley said. Phones at the Utah Pride Center have been ringing steadily over the past two days with calls from couples stuck in the same situation as Mr McCraley and Mr Mathie, Ms Risbon said. Her organization and other gay marriage proponents made sure there were plenty of marriage officials at the county clerk offices in the days after the December 20 ruling. Ms Risbon said they were encouraging everyone to finish the process right then and there, in case a court granted the state's request for a halt. But, some people needed or wanted more time, she said. Many were waiting to hold ceremonies until out-of-town family and friends could make it in. The family of one lesbian couple were driving from Colorado on Monday for a ceremony this week. 'It's heartbreaking,' Ms Risbon said. 'These couples waited and now they just can't.'","Hundreds forced to cancel ceremonies after licenses are declared no longer valid .

A cancer research pioneer used computer software to spy on his ex-wife as they went through a bitter divorce, prosecutors have said. Dr Steven Curley, 57, from Missouri City near Houston, Texas, faces 20 years in prison if convicted of the charge of unlawful intercept. He allegedly plotted with a computer expert, Hand Lehmann, to install a tracking program called eBlaster, which records passwords, online conversations, keystrokes and webpage use. Arrest: Dr Steven Curley has been charged with unlawful intercept after allegedly using spying software to monitor his ex-wife online. He is pictured left in his mug shot and right in an interview in 2007 . Targeted: He allegedly used the software to spy on his ex-wife, Karen, after their failed two-year marriage . The popular program, which costs $100, is used by parents to track their children's internet use, by employers to watch their workers and by spouses checking for cheating partners, KHOU reported. Curley allegedly used the program to . spy on his wife Karen, a physician's assistant, as they divorced after . just two years of marriage. System: He allegedly used eBlaster, which records key strokes and internet use . The couple had once worked together at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Curley’s attorney, Robert Scardino, says he believes a bitter divorce is behind the accusations and that once further information comes to light, 'he'll be vindicated'. 'He’s very concerned that something like . this could have an adverse effect on his career,' Scardino told KHOU. 'It’s certainly a . distraction from what he does.' Dr Curley, a Professor of Surgical Oncology, worked at MD Anderson to develop new ways of beating hard-to-treat cancers using radio waves. In October, a report announced he had just been named chief of surgical oncology at the Dan L. Duncan Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. MD Anderson said he left the hospital at the end of 2013. The spying program, eBlaster, is virtually undetectable after it has been put in a system, and once in place, it can capture activity on a computer and send details to an email address. Sidney May from the Spy Emporium in Montrose told KHOU: 'We have customers that come back and buy multiple copies because they want to spy on the laptop and the desktop.' Tracked: Curley's lawyer said once the details of his divorce with ex-wife Karen (pictured) become public, his client will be vindicated . It is legal for parents to use the software for their children's internet use, as well as employers and educators, although monitoring personal email remains a gray area. But it is illegal for spouses to use the systems to spy; in 2007, an Austin, Texas man was sentenced to four years in prison for spying on his wife using a similar system, SpyRecon. Curley and Lehmann both face a charge of unlawful intercept. This case is set to go to court on January 22.","Dr Steven Curley, from Houston, Texas, 'plotted with computer expert to install a tracking program called eBlaster on his ex-wife's device'

Sir David King, the former Chief Scientific Advisor to the Government, has issued a warning about the future of fracking . Britain would have to drill up to 2,000 shale wells a year to achieve a substantial drop in energy costs, according to experts. Sir David King, the government's former chief scientist, suggested cost benefits from fracking may only be achieved with major disruption to the landscape. He expressed support for firms drilling to explore the size of the UK's reserves which could reduce reliance on imported gas from Russia and Qatar. But he warned those expecting gas . prices to plummet as in the United States, that the far higher . concentration of people and resulting planning issues in Britain would . make it very difficult to do it 'on anything like the same scale' and . raise problems with 'social acceptance.' David . Cameron has embraced fracking - horizontal drilling to extract natural . gas from shale rocks thousands of feet underground. The . prime minister said last year: 'I think we would be making a big . mistake as a nation if we did not think hard about how to encourage . fracking and cheaper prices right here in the UK. 'If . you look at what's happening in America with the advent of shale gas . and fracking, their energy costs in business and their gas prices are . half the level of ours' But . Sir David, who is William Hague's special representative on climate . change, said: 'If we were looking at an expectancy of a thousand or two . thousand wells a year - which would have an impact on our economics - it . would be very difficult to foresee how that could happen in Britain.' He added: 'I'm all for exploring shale gas in the UK, I think there is a potential there. 'I see it as a relatively medium term . potential, I don't think it's going to continue well into the future - . but I think there is an economic advantage from being able to produce a . primary energy source within the British Isles, obviating the need to . import. 'But I would . caution the extent to which this can have a dent on our economics, . simply because I don't think that we can frack on anything like the . scale that is taking place in the United States.' He . told a House of Lords committee that in the US, where up to 30,000 . wells are drilled per year 'there has been quite an outcry among the . population' in built-up areas. In Balcombe in Sussex, drilling by the . firm Cuadrilla was ground to a halt by protestors last year. Quadrilla drilling site where protestors took action at the fracking site in Balcombe in West Sussex . German-owned energy giant Npower has snubbed a Government call to give a £50 price cut to all customers. Five . weeks ago, the Chancellor announced a change in Green and Eco levies . that were designed to cut the bills of all families struggling to pay . for heat and light by £50. However, . Npower, which is Britain's most expensive energy firm, said . yesterday(thrs) that some 500,000 customers on fixed rate deals will . only get a reduction of £12. At . the same time, 54,000 households who only get their gas for central . heating and hot water from Npower will not get any reduction at all. The . full £50 reduction is being reserved for dual fuel customers on a . variable tariff who suffered an average price rise of 10.4per cent in . December. The two biggest . suppliers, British Gas and SSE, are giving a £50 cut to all customers, . however, EDF, Eon, Scottish Power and now Npower, say they will not. Each well requires tons of sand and water delivered in lorries used to crack open the rocks, he said, which causes damage to roads and problems with 'social acceptance'. And the gas produced from each well drops by around 70pc after the first year, he said. 'If you want to keep up production you need to keep up fracking.' Professor David MacKay, Chief Scientific Officer at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, told peers that the UK's shale gas reserves are estimated to be around a third of the size of those in the North Sea. But he said how much could be extracted, and the impact on energy prices, would remain 'extremely uncertain' until the first 20 to 40 wells are drilled in the coming years. The UK will remain heavily dependent on gas, which currently produces around a third of our energy, 'for many decades' for industry and heating systems'. Hence, he said: 'We must have an energy policy that adds up...it seems a reasonable thing to do to try and source our gas domestically. The alternative will be an increasing dependence on other countries such as Qatar and Norway and Russia for gas.' Both experts played down concerns that fracking could lead to water contamination or earthquakes saying UK regulations were strong enough to guard against it. Green groups are against fracking, saying it will make it difficult to meet the legally binding target to cut carbon emissions by 80pc by 2050 - and urge investment in wind and solar farms instead. But the government's independent climate advisor, former Tory minister Lord Deben, said campaigners with a 'theological objection' to fracking are 'just factually wrong'. He told MPs at another energy committee yesterday that gas has a valuable part to play in the economy.","Sir David King issues warned to those expecting gas prices to plummet .

An Austrian woman is facing a firing squad in Indonesia after being found with 6.6lbs of crystal meth in her suitcase. Blonde dancer and charity worker Susanne Mayr claims she was conned by a talent scout who promised her fame, but instead planted the drugs in the lining of her suitcase. The baby-faced 29-year-old was on an all-expenses paid performance trip to South Africa when her 'manager' sent her to Indonesia for work. Facing death: Austrian Susanne Mayr may be sentenced to death after she was caught with 3kg (6.6lbs) of crystal meth in her suitcase in Indonesia . Ms Mayr claims she was given a new suitcase by the talent scout and that she had no idea the crystal meth was inside the lining of the bag. Speaking at the family home in Baden, in Lower Austria, her mother Ingeborg said: ‘She had connections with various people in Africa because she worked at supporting a school project down there and money she earned from her dancing used to be sent there. 'She had even visited the region, and had always dreamed of being able to get work down there so was really happy when she was spotted by the talent scout on YouTube who contacted her over the Internet and offered her a job. ‘She performed under the name Young Bebe and had quite a following, and in November she set off for her new life. 'When she was in South Africa she performed a few times but then her manager told her that he had some work for her Indonesia but that she would have to get nicer luggage and he took it to a shop where they purchased a new suitcase.' Conned? The 29-year-old performer claims she was tricked by a talent scout who gave her the suitcase with a fake lining where the drugs were hidden . Family woes: Her mother Ingeborg in Baden, Lower Austria, has spoken to Susanne who fears she may be shot . Harsh awakening: The 29-year-old was on an all-expenses paid performance trip to South Africa when her 'manager' sent her to Indonesia for work . Ingeborg adds: ‘But it was part of a con and the case actually had a fake lining with the drugs hidden inside. She called me from jail to tell me about what had happened, she told me: ""Mummy, you've got to help me. They're going to shoot me"".' Austrian officials have confirmed they are paying the estimated $50,000 in legal fees to try and argue the young woman's case. Drug smuggling is regarded as a serious offence in Indonedia and with over 3kg (6.6lbs) of crystal meth in the case, it is enough to earn Ms Mayr the death penalty if she is convicted. She has reportedly cooperated with officials, but should she be convicted, it is likely that the volume of drugs will weigh heavily in favour of a death sentence. Customs officials in the country believe the case may be connected to a second drug smuggler, a German man, who was also caught a few days later in November at Jakarta's international airport where he had flew into from Senegal. The German, 49, was caught carrying 4.15 kilograms of the same crystal methamphetamine drug. ‘The methamphetamines were hidden in the lining of his luggage. They have a street value of 475,104 dollars,’ said airport customers chief Okto Irianto.","Austrian performer Susanne Mayr is facing death sentence in Indonesia .

"PUBLISHED: . 04:41 EST, 7 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:49 EST, 7 January 2014 . It would be better for Britain to be poorer but with fewer immigrants, Nigel Farage claimed today. The UK Independence Party leader said he said he would ‘rather we weren’t slightly richer’ if it means allowing more people into the country to work and create jobs. But he also revealed his party does not have an official policy on immigration, although he spent ‘many hours’ yesterday discussing it. Ukip leader Nigel Farage claimed immigration had not bought benefits for Britain and would prefer to curb the numbers moving to the UK even if it makes the country poorer . The government is under pressure after restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain were lifted at the start of the year. Business Secretary Vince Cable sparked a fresh Cabinet rift on the issue, after he claimed David Cameron will fail to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next election. However, Mr Farage today insisted that immigration had not been of net benefit to Britain and would rather fewer people moved here in future even if it left the country worse off. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘The fact is that if people come to this country from Eastern Europe and they’re earning minimum wage, they’re getting tax credits, possibly child tax credits, child benefit, housing benefit, and this so far has been the undiscussed part of this. So I question the economics. David Cameron will fail to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next election, Vince Cable has declared. The . Lib Dem Business Secretary said the target was ‘impractical’ and the . Prime Minister ‘almost certainly won’t achieve’ it by 2015. His . intervention could spark a new round of Coalition bloodletting – and . comes only weeks after he accused Mr Cameron of behaving like Enoch . Powell. However, it also risked backfiring by exposing how out of touch the Lib Dems are with public opinion on the issue. Mr Cable made his comments in the documentary The Truth About Immigration, to be aired tonight on BBC2. The . programme released a poll showing that more than three-quarters of the . public want migrant numbers reduced, and more than half want them to be . cut ‘a lot’. Mr Cable said it was ‘not sensible to . have an arbitrary cap’ on net migration – because many elements which . make up the target cannot be controlled. He . said: ‘So it involves British people emigrating – you can’t control . that. It involves free movement within the European Union – in and out. ‘It involves British people coming back from overseas. ‘So . setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful, it almost certainly won’t . achieve the below 100,000 level the Conservatives have set, so let’s be . practical about it.’ ‘The . idea it should come down to 100,000 is something the Liberal Democrats . have never signed up to because we simply regard it as impractical.’ ‘But if you said to me: “Would you want to see over the next ten years a further 5million people come into Britain and if that happened we’d all be slightly richer?” I would say: actually, do you know what I’d rather we weren’t slightly richer. ‘I’d rather we had communities that felt more united and I’d rather have a situation where young unemployed British people had a realistic chance of getting a job. ‘So yes, I do think the social side of this matters more than pure market economics.’ It comes as a new poll shows four out of ten Labour voters think immigration is bad for the economy, polling shows. The NatCen Social Research British Social Attitudes poll found 40 per cent of Labour voters said it damaged growth. Meanwhile, 22 per cent said it was neither good nor bad, and 36 per cent said it helped the economy. Mr Farage insisted Britain cannot have its own immigration policy while it remains a member of the European Union. But he admitted that his own party, which wants thr UK to leave the EU, does not have an immigration policy either. ‘We spent many hours yesterday discussing it,’ he admitted. ‘For example, how do you deal with the problem of illegal immigrants in Britain? Not everybody from politics can give you perfect solutions. We have something like 1m, maybe it’s 2million, illegal immigrants in Britain – how do we find those people? How do we deal with those problems? ‘What we can do very quickly is stop open doors; what we can do is have proper border checks to stop people with criminal records coming to Britain – they’re the things we can do. ‘But to have a total policy solution after the disaster that’s engulfed us since Labour came to power in 1997 is no easy matter.’ Net migration – the difference . between the numbers arriving and leaving Britain – was below 100,000 . during much of the 1990s before increasing sharply in 1998 under Labour. From 2004 it was consistently above 200,000 and reached a peak of more than 250,000 in 2010. After Theresa May entered the Home . Office it fell to 153,000 by 2012 but rose to 182,000 in the 12 months . to June last year, driven by arrivals from southern Europe. The . Tories pledged to reduce the total to under 100,000 by the time of the . next election, but the Liberal Democrats never signed up to the policy.","UK Independence Party leader denies immigration has bought benefits .

The Manchester United and England footballer Chris Smalling has apologised for his ‘ill thought out and insensitive’ decision to dress as a suicide bomber at a fancy dress party. The 24-year-old sparked outrage after being photographed dressed in an Arabic kaffiyeh headdress and military-style vest with a fake circuit board and cables attached. Smalling claimed the outfit was ‘an attempted comedy play’ on the popular ‘Jagerbomb’ alcoholic drink, which is thought to be why he attached bottles of Jagermeister and Red Bull to his belt as imitation grenades. The costume has caused fury among survivors and relatives of those affected by terrorist attacks. Speaking to the Sun the father of a young man who died in the July 7 2005 terror attacks in London said he ‘could not condemn the costume strongly enough’. Oldham resident Graham Foulkes, 61, whose 22-year-old son David was killed at Edgware Road by suicide bomber Sidique Khan added: ‘It is one of the most offensive things I have ever seen’. Jacqui Putnam, who survived the Edgware Road blast in 2005, said people should 'think twice' before making light of terrorism. She said that even after eight years, people affected are still coming to terms with the terror attack, adding ‘It does not make it any easier when you see people who make light of it.' ‘It is silliness really. I do not think people who do these things mean any harm but unfortunately the affect it has on people like me and people who are in a worse position - those who lost loved ones - is hurtful,’ she said. Ms Putman went on to say: ‘I am sure . that he did not mean to offend anyone but I wish people would think . twice… If people could only think twice about the pain this could cause . to people who have lost loved ones in these circumstances it would be . appreciated by survivors and the bereaved alike.' Stupid: Chris Smalling (right) has already made 20 appearances this season for his embattled manager David Moyes (left). His decision to dress up as a suicide bomber has been branded stupid and offensive . In response to the anger over his costume, Smalling issued an apology through his management company, Wasserman Media Group. The . statement read: ‘Chris and his girlfriend hosted a fancy dress party to . celebrate Christmas and their belated birthdays with close friends in . the assumed privacy of his own home.’ It . added: ‘Although he fully accepts in hindsight it was an ill-thought . out and insensitive decision, absolutely no harm was intended whatsoever . and he apologises for any offence caused'. Des Wright, Chairman of the Chester and North Wales branch of the Manchester United’s supporters association, told MailOnline: ‘I just think he was bit daft really. He’s a very intelligent man and should have known better. But I don’t think there will be any fallout. Not when royalty do similar things. Didn’t Prince Harry dress up as a Nazi?’ He added: ‘I think the supporters as a whole will feel exactly the same way as me. He was stupid, but he’s apologised and that’s definitely the right thing to do. I think we should all move on now.’ Smalling signed for Manchester United from Fulham four years ago, in January 2010. He has already made 20 appearances for embattled manager David Moyes this season, and is seen as a key member of both the Manchester United and England squads. Smalling made his senior England debut in a Euro 2012 qualifier against Bulgaria in September 2011 and has since made eight further ppearances for the national team.","Chris Smalling, 24, branded 'stupid' and 'offensive' for shocking costume .

Families should buy British to cut down on food imports, the Environment Secretary will say today. Owen Paterson believes a quarter of the food we now import should be produced domestically instead. Britain ships in 40 per cent of its food including New Zealand lamb, French apples, Spanish cucumbers and Danish bacon. Home-grown: The Environment Minister will encourage people to buy apples grown in Britain (file picture) ‘We can’t grow mangoes or pineapples, but . we can encourage UK consumers and businesses to buy Scottish . raspberries or Kent apples,’ Mr Paterson will tell the Oxford Farming . Conference. He will urge shoppers to return to buying seasonal British food rather than rely on produce grown abroad all year round. An estimated £8billion of fruit and vegetables was imported last year – £2billion of this being varieties that could be cultivated here. Homemade: Environment Minister Owen Paterson believes a quarter of the food we now import should be produced domestically instead . Eighty-one per cent of tomatoes – a crop once common in UK greenhouses – are foreign-grown, as are 59 per cent of mushrooms we eat. Fewer than half of broad, runner and dwarf beans consumed here are domestic. In 2000, UK farmers produced far more than was required, exporting the rest. Just 30 per cent of cucumbers are grown in Britain, down from 55 per cent 14 years ago. And only 22 per cent of spring onions – an incredibly easy vegetable to grow here – are UK produced, down from 62 per cent in 2000. Mr Paterson will pledge the Government’s support for farmers, promising investment in new technologies and cutting bureaucracy. ‘As British farmers and food producers . you know that we grow some of the best food in the world here,’ he will . say. ‘We have a top-class fruit and veg sector which produces . everything from green beans to strawberries, yet we imported £8billion . of fruit and veg in 2012. ‘This is a huge opportunity, and it’s up to all of us – farmers, food manufacturers and the Government – to take action. ‘By buying seasonal fruit and veg we can improve the nation’s health, help the environment and boost the economy.’ Richard Young, of the Sustainable Food Trust, said a generation had grown up expecting food to be available on demand, all year. ‘Supermarkets have become an Aladdin’s cave to us and it is very difficult to resist things,’ he added. Brought in: An estimated £8billion of fruit and vegetables was imported last year - £2billion of this being varieties that could be cultivated here (file picture) ‘If I go into a supermarket, I inevitably buy things I didn’t intend to. It’s clever marketing. ‘It has made people of a certain age believe that they have a divine right to eat mange tout peas in the middle of winter. There are all sorts of reasons for not being able to count on inexhaustible amounts of food continuing to come from abroad in the far distant future. ‘You only need two major droughts in successive years in America, Russia or Australia for grain prices to go up quite dramatically.’ Joanna Blythman, a food writer and expert on the British food chain, said shoppers should begin by thinking which locally-produced foods were in season. ‘There are some foods I feel I never need to buy – but no one is saying to never eat a lemon or buy a mango,’ she said. ‘But at this time of the year, don’t buy green beans from Kenya or blueberries from South America but concentrate on things grown here like apples and pears and the first Yorkshire rhubarb. ‘It is a very much more interesting way to eat. Just having what you want every day of the year gets quite boring because every day is the same. ‘There is nothing duller than clapped out green beans and baby corn flown in from Thailand all year round.’ Mr Paterson’s announcement was last night welcomed by food producers – but many questioned whether the Government would do enough. They cited problems including European proposals that the Union flag be banished from packets of British meat. Peter Melchett, of the Soil Association, an organic farming group, said: ‘This announcement is the one positive thing this Government has said about farming. ‘If you look at organic farming, which is beginning to return to growth, we have a real problem because organic farms in the UK get less support than in any other EU state.’ EU governments give an average of £135 a hectare in funding for farmers to convert to and stay organic, more than double the rate here, he said. Latest Government figures show 24 per cent of farming businesses failed to make a profit in 2010/11, with a further 39 per cent making an income of less than £30,000.","Owen Paterson wants people to buy 'Scottish raspberries' and 'Kent apples'

Aircraft maker Airbus has helped develop technology which could eliminate the problem of missing baggage, a problem that costs the aviation industry nearly £2 billion a year. According to the latest industry figures, about four pieces of luggage will be lost on the average Boeing 747 flight.

Passengers are most likely to lose a bag when changing flights - especially if the connection time is short. One of the major reasons for luggage being lost is when the paper tags carrying the bar code are ripped off as cases are shunted along conveyor belts to the aircraft. It was this which led to the loss of thousands of bags by British Airways following the chaotic opening of Heathrow’s Terminal 5 in March 2008.

Islington Council in north London also spent £859,000 on taxis in 2013, a Freedom of Information request revealed. The Labour-led authority is now under pressure to dramatically reduce its lavish spending on refreshments, which adds up to the equivalent of seven million tea bags and 429,000 packs of digestive biscuits over just three years. Expensive: Cash-strapped Islington Council, based at Islington Town Hall (pictured), has spent £133,000 on the equivalent of seven million tea bags and 429,000 packs of digestive biscuits in over just three years . The Freedom of Information request revealed spending by Islington council between 2010 and 2013. Speaking of the council's outgoings, The TaxPayers' Alliance said 'residents expect their council tax to be spent on front-line services, not first-rate dining'. Campaign director Robert Oxley added: 'This is an absolute fortune on council snacks at a time when many households struggle even to put food on the table.' Under pressure: Catherine West, leader of Islington's Labour-run council, needs to save £26million in 2014 . 'Council chiefs need to slash the biscuit bill and end any unjustified provisions of free food,' he said. Islington Liberal Democrat leader Terry Stacy said he was 'gobsmacked' by news of the council's spending. He said: 'Labour councillors obviously think they can do what they want and hope nobody notices...Either that or they are failing to keep a proper eye on spending.' Mr Stacy added: 'When residents are facing the squeeze, how can they justify this? It seems they can find money for the things they want.' In defence of the spending, Andy Hull, the council's executive member for finance, said most of the money spent on taxis has actually been to transport adults and children to schools and day centres. Another council officer who did not want to be named said the £133,000 spent on refreshments and cookies since 2010 included the cost of public functions, including the annual Christmas dinner for pensioners and events to encourage foster carers. He said: 'These figures show we are cutting the cash spent on refreshments every year, spending half as much as we did three years ago.' 'Last year, the council spent less than 20p per week on refreshments for each member of staff,' he added. The council officer went on to say: 'Nonetheless, I am reminding colleagues to redouble their efforts to minimise such costs.'","Islington Council has spent £133,000 on refreshments in just three years .

The 31-year-old German international midfielder yesterday became the first Premier League star to reveal he was homosexual, saying that he had recently accepted that he 'preferred men'. Hitzlsperger, who ended his playing career in September due to persistent injuries, said that other sportsmen's revelations about their sexual orientation, including those of Tom Daley, had made him feel that he was not alone.

Inspiration: German football star Thomas Hitzlsperger (right) has said that diver Tom Daley's YouTube acknowledgement that he was in a same-sex relationship (left) helped him to come out . Last month the 19-year-old Olympian revealed in a video posted on YouTube that he was in a relationship with a man, later revealed to be screenwriter Dustin Lance Black. Daley, who won bronze in the men's 10 metre platform competition at the London 2012 Olympics, had said: ‘Come spring this year my life changed massively when I met someone and they made me feel so happy, so safe and everything just feels great - and that someone is a guy. 'Of course I still fancy girls but right now I'm dating a guy and I couldn't be happier.’ The former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton player said he had also felt empowered by Welsh rugby player Gareth Thomas, who publically announced he was gay in 2009, and John Amaechi, who became the first NBA (National Basketball Association) player to speak out about his homosexuality. Big moment: The 31-year-old footballer ended his playing career in September due to persistent injuries . Announcement: Last month 19-year-old Olympian Tom Daley revealed in a video posted on YouTube that he was in a relationship with a man, later revealed to be screenwriter Dustin Lance Black . Justin Fashanu was the first professional footballer in Britain to come out in 1990 before he took his own life eight years later, aged 37. But he never played in the Premier League, which began in 1992. Hitzlsperger said that he was also encouraged by former . Leeds United and US winger Robbie Rogers announced he was gay last . year, and hoped that he too might be able to encourage other footballers to do the same. 'I read about John Amaechi, Gareth Thomas and Tom Daley,' Hitzlsperger told The Guardian newspaper. 'They weren't footballers but the fact that they went public gave me the feeling that I was not alone. I began to think that I could help other footballers who might be in the same shoes, so that they could see that here's someone who was even an international.' Empowered: Hitzlsperger said he had read about rugby player Gareth Thomas (left), who announced he was gay in 2009, and basketball player John Amaechi (right), who was the first NBA star to come out publically .

Early death: Former England Under-21 international Justin Fashanu was the first professional footballer in Britain to come out in 1990 before he took his own life eight years later, aged 37 . Hitzlsperger, who was capped 52 times by his country, said he had considered coming out while playing for German side Wolfsburg in 2011-12, but had been warned not to. He had said that he had only realised ‘in the past few years’ that he would ‘prefer to live together with another man’, and in 2007 had been due to marry his childhood sweetheart Inga Totzauer, only for the pair to break up a month before their wedding. The footballer said team-mates eventually stopped asking about his lack of a girlfriend, and that he had not had to lie about his sexuality. But he said that he had found the decision to make his sexuality public had been a difficult one to make, and added that he had the 'total support' of his family. Star: Thomas Hitzlsperger in action for Germany (left) and Aston Villa (right) The former international, who played . in the 2006 World Cup and the 2008 European Championship, has been inundated with messages of support and praise since yesterday's announcement made via Germany's Die Zeit newspaper that he was gay. Former England footballer Gary . Lineker said on Twitter: 'Congratulations to Thomas Hitzlsperger on . bravely being the first player to have played in the Premier League to . ""come out"".' Lineker later tweeted that he was looking forward to interviewing Hitzlsperger for the BBC One show Football Focus this week. 'A man, hopefully, paving the way for others to follow,' he added.

David Cameron tweeted: 'As an #AVFC fan, I've always admired . what Thomas Hitzlsperger did on the pitch – but I admire him even more . today. A brave & important move.' However, Hitzlsperger, who also played for VfB Stuttgart and Lazio, said that the description of his as courageous, though nice to hear, was part of the problem facing the taboo around homosexuality in sport. He said: 'That's something that should change. I sincerely hope that we'll see the day when nobody mentions courage in these circumstances anymore, because it will be seen as totally normal that a sports person will speak about his homosexuality, the way others talk about their wives and girlfriends.'","Thomas Hitzlsperger says he had read about Tom Daley's announcement .

A biker who claimed he was shunted off his Harley-Davidson by an angry bus driver was sent a high-visibility jacket as an apology, it emerged today. Pub landlord and father-of-one Gerry McLoughlin, 47, of Bristol, said he was knocked off his motorbike after an altercation with the First bus driver who had sounded his horn at him. But when he complained the firm sent him the jacket, an offer of cycling lessons and an invitation to two events aimed at helping bus drivers and cyclists understand the obstacles they both face. Apologetic gift: Pub landlord and father-of-one Gerry McLoughlin, 47, of Bristol, said he was knocked off his motorbike after an altercation with the First bus driver who had sounded his horn at him . Mr McLoughlin, who suffered painful burns to his leg in the crash, said: ‘I feel like I am being mocked. ‘My leg got badly infected which meant I had to stay at home for a week having it dressed while my wife and daughter went on holiday. Even when I got out there I couldn’t go in the pool so it ruined it.’ Ouch: Harley-Davidson biker Mr McLoughlin suffered painful burns to his leg in the incident . Mr McLoughlin admits he swore at the driver of the number 45 bus when he beeped his horn at him in Bristol city centre on July 26 last year. But he claims the driver then rammed into the back of his bike - knocking him off - and then refused to hand over his details. Mr McLoughlin, who runs the Miners Arms in Bedminster, Bristol, added: ‘He didn’t need to knock me off my bike. I went round to the next stop where he was and wanted his details. ‘He said there was CCTV everywhere so not to worry but I said I still wanted his details. 'They claim I hit the bus and fell off then chased him and told him I would smash him up - that’s just nonsense.’ The fall caused painful burns to his right leg which forced him to delay his family holiday to Spain with wife Tracey, 49, and daughter Finola, 11, by a week so he could have treatment. He called First to ask them to speak to the driver about his behaviour and the incident is being investigated by insurance claim handlers. But last month he was sent an invite to cycling proficiency lessons and the fluorescent vest. Jonathan Barnard, general manager of First, said the company made a mistake. He said: ‘We are aware of the incident involving Mr McLoughlin and this is currently being dealt with by our insurance claim handlers. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage. Contact: Mr McLoughlin called First (file picture) to ask them to speak to the driver about his behaviour and the incident is being investigated by insurance claim handlers . ‘In relation to the pack sent to Mr McLoughlin, this was sent to him in error.

The locals all acknowledge that you can hardly live next to Britain’s most famous river and then grumble when things get a little soggy. But even old Thames hands are starting to feel nervous as recent rains and saturated soil continue to see water levels rise and rise. Britain’s coast has endured a dramatic pummelling in recent days and a new Lake District has taken shape in Somerset. But some of our most exclusive neighbourhoods are also suffering. Scroll down for video . Houses along the river are under threat, such as this one in Goring-on-Thames . Closer to the metropolis, the January storms are inflicting stealthier, more incremental damage. Scenery like this has made the Thames Valley a celebrity Riviera; sail upstream from Elton and the Queen and you’ll find Wogan a couple of miles beyond Parky. These banks have also produced some of our most popular literature, not least Three Men In A Boat and the children’s classic Wind In The Willows. But what would Ratty, Toad and the gang have made of the dense brown torrent swirling its way through Pangbourne, Henley, Cookham and all those other handsome riverside towns that like to claim they inspired the author, Kenneth Grahame? Sir Terry Wogan (left) and Sir Michael Parkinson (right) are both high-profile residents who live along the river . I head for the award-winning River & Rowing Museum dedicated to the Thames and all its works, including Grahame’s masterpiece. Sadly, the museum, on the edge of Henley, is closed for the first time in its history. Toad Hall is shut. It’s Wind in the Wallows round here. The car park is underwater and the sewage system is backing up. ‘We’re used to a bit of flooding, but this is exceptional,’ says facilities manager Andrew Brown. ‘We had a funeral party booked in for today, but we had to cancel.’ Looking back to town, it’s impossible to determine where the Thames stops and Henley begins. The whole area is a huge pond, with the occasional signpost or park bench poking above the surface. At nearby Hambleden, the lock is redundant. The water level is the same height at both ends and the raging weir beside the lock is now the Chilterns’ very own white water rapids. The Hobbs family have been operating boats in Henley since 1870, but the main office is marooned from the road by several feet of water. Fifth-generation owner Jonathan Hobbs, 42, has erected a gangplank to get to his desk. Beauty spots such as Henley, which helped inspire Kenneth Grahame while writing The Wind In The Willows, and now suffering the effects of the storms . Parts of the town are now underwater, including the River & Rowing Museum which had to cancel a booking from a funeral party because of the flooding . He has plaques on the wall to show various high water marks over the years. We are still a few inches short of the disaster that followed the sudden melting of snow in March 1947. But this week’s flooding is on a par with the last major deluge of 2003. Radio and TV presenter Mike Read, who lives nearby, found the water two inches from his back door yesterday. Before setting off for his  daily show on BBC Radio Berkshire, he shifted what furniture he could upstairs. ‘It was like moving house in a couple of hours,’ he says. ‘Our local lock-keeper is like  the Messiah. Everyone is asking him what’s going to happen next.’ A little further upstream, the village of Shiplake could, indeed, accommodate a ship right now. Nearby Wargrave is home to assorted luminaries ranging from the Sultan of Oman to magician Paul Daniels. Paul Daniels, who raised his house on stilts, is said to be braving out the floods in the town of Wargrave . The Sultan is elsewhere, but Mr Daniels, who fought a long battle with the council to get permission to raise his home on stilts, is braving it out. His lane, now impassable, appears to be an additional tributary of the Thames, but he is said to be philosophical, as most people in this part of the world are — or were. ‘You get used to a certain amount of flooding, of course, but if it gets any higher then people are going to start getting worried,’ says unflappable Wargrave parish councillor, Victoria Hermon, standing outside the riverside house where her family has lived for nearly 150 years. Her garden shed is now on the edge of what looks like a very substantial estuary. Unfortunately for the locals, the Environment Agency warns that levels will go on rising for a few more days yet. As of last night, the Jubilee River, a £110 million, seven-mile storm drain built to alleviate flooding around the Berkshire towns of Windsor and Maidenhead, was operating at maximum capacity for the first time in its 14-year history. Its sluice gates cannot be opened any wider. If the water gets much higher than this, it won’t just start flooding bits of Maidenhead — and perhaps some of chef Heston Blumenthal’s neighbours in nearby Bray. Unfortunately for those who live along the Thames' banks, water levels are expected to rise again in two days . Britain has experienced three weeks of heavy rain and flooding which has seen rivers across the country burst . It could even have the bizarre effect of submerging the 2012 Olympic rowing complex at Eton Dorney. Just over a bridge outside Windsor, on a sharp bend in the Thames, residents of Ham Island are no longer waiting for the floods to come. It’s too late for that. Gillie Bolton and her husband, Jim, are the local volunteer flood wardens. They have canoes tied up by the front door and are busy checking that all the residents are in one piece. ‘One neighbour is on holiday so I’ve evacuated her chickens to a nice home in Old Windsor,’ says Gillie. radio DJ Mike Read, who lives near Henley, found floodwater two inches from his back door yesterday . She has just finished distributing a lorry-load of portable loos to neighbours whose drains have packed up. Her phone rings ceaselessly. Everyone wants to know the latest news about water levels. ‘I wouldn’t mind if this was an act of God, but it’s not. It’s a man-made problem,’ she says, echoing what seems to be the unanimous view round here. Everyone points out that Ham Island started flooding only when the authorities opened the Jubilee River in 2002. Having carried excess floodwater around Maidenhead and  Windsor, the man-made waterway then spits it all back into the Thames just ahead of the stretch that runs past Ham  Island, Wraysbury and historic Runnymede. The residents are convinced the consequent surge effect is the cause of their problems. ‘It’s as if we are being sacrificed to protect all those expensive properties further upstream,’ says retired engineer John Morgan, 72, whose house is now entirely surrounded by water. Like everyone else, he is angry that the Environment Agency has stopped dredging the river. ‘Bring back the dredgers and do it every year just like they used to,’ says Noel Robinson, 81, shouting at me from her window. She’s lived here since 1954 and says things are worse than ever. A few doors away, events manager Cait Kidd and her husband David are busy shifting anything moveable upstairs. Their house sits on the junction of the river and the overspill from the neighbouring lock. It’s weirdly mesmerising to look out and see two furious torrents merging next to their garage. A few miles away, by the mighty sluice gates of the Jubilee River, I meet the Environment Agency’s man in charge of the flood strategy for this part of the Thames. Cookham, in Berkshire, is another idyllic town at risk of flooding if storms continue for much longer . Downstream near Gloucestershire flooding from the Thames has caused devastation to farmland and housing . Ian Tomes explains that the Jubilee project has actually saved thousands of people from flooding and that it has not made things any worse for anyone else. ‘Every time we build a flood defence anywhere, someone will say that they have been sacrificed to help someone else upstream, but it’s just not true,’ he says. ‘And dredging would make no difference at all. What we are seeing is an exceptionally high volume of water — as in 2003 — and I am afraid it still looks set to rise a little more.’ Not once in the course of two days wandering along the Thames do I hear any self-pity. No one is demanding compensation. Everyone accepts that if they want to live in a largely idyllic spot, there must be the occasional downside. They’ll be laughing again come the summer. But for now, it’s time for bottled water,  portable loos, torchlight and stoicism. Standing next to the bungalow that was once the home of band leader Billy Cotton, Ham Island resident Linda Vittozzi points out another famous local landmark. It is the late Ernie Wise’s cabin cruiser — Wisecrack —straining on its moorings against the swirling waters. Even Little Ern, I suspect, would be pushed to get a joke out of this.","Parts of Britain are now experiencing third week of rain .

'80% sure it's him': The body of a Western man who slashed his throat in a Cambodian lodging house is believed to be fugitive Stuart Green who is accused of murdering a young woman, believed to be a prostitute known as Nari (above) The body of a Western man who slashed his throat with a shard of glass in a Cambodian lodging house is believed to be fugitive British murder suspect Stuart Green, police said today. Green, 47, was earlier reported to have been arrested after being on the run following the discovery of the body of a naked woman under a bed with her throat slashed in another cheap hotel in Phnom Penh. But in a dramatic development today, police said the foreign national found dead in a cheap flop house - doss house - was believed '70 to 80 per cent' to be that of Stuart Green from Eccles, Greater Manchester. Municipal police official Mom Sitha told the Phnom Penh Post that the body was found without identification in the lodgings in Phnom Penh's Daun Penh district. He had apparently smashed a window, then used a shard of glass to cut his own throat - a macabre replay of the savage death of the young woman whose throat had been cut and who had suffered other stabbing injuries around her neck. Mr Sitha said police were reasonably certain that the dead man was Green, but no passport or other identity papers were found in the room. 'The dead foreigner, we suspect 70 to 80 per cent, that it is Green,' he said. Police said the dead man was believed to be 'a little over 30 years of age' which would make him much younger than Green's 47 years. The owner of the lodging house told local media that the Western man had taken up occupancy of room 304 on the second floor at 3am on January 5 after a friend of his, who was not staying there, had rented the room for him. On the morning of January 6, local media reported, the guesthouse owner and cleaning staff became worried that they had not seen the man emerge from his room the day after he had checked in. When they went to the room, they found the door bolted and a mattress had been stood up against the keyhole to prevent anyone looking in. Murder probe: The naked body of the young woman was found under the bed with her throat slashed inside the £12-a-night Bolyna Palace Hotel in Phnom Penh (above) The owner forced his way in and found the foreign man lying on the bed. It is not known who the friend is who checked the man into the room. Stuart Green had originally checked into the £12-a-night Bolyna Palace Hotel in Phnom Penh with a woman - believed to be a prostitute known as Nari, although she has yet to be formally identified - on Christmas day. Late at night on December 28 Green came down from his room to the reception desk and asked for the return of his passport - customarily kept until the bill was paid - because he needed it to draw money from a bank. Even though no banks were open at that time of night, about 11pm, the passport was returned and Green walked out, never to return. Trail of clues: Stuart Green had originally checked into the Bolyna Palace Hotel (above) with a woman - believed to be a prostitute known as Nari - on Christmas day . The following day the naked body of the young woman was found under the bed with her throat cut. Police began a search for Green in the city and ordered border posts to watch for him in case he tried to leave the country. Earlier this week, a writer on an expatriatre forum insisted that Green had been arrested and later gave details that police had picked him up at a local market. The writer said Green, who always wore sunglasses, had been seen several times in the city - particularly near the market - since the discovery of the woman's body and he was surprised that he had been able to move around so freely. If Green was not arrested, but had cause to suspect police were closing in on him, it might explain his arrival at a flop house in the early hours of the morning, expatriates speculated today. Green, who was said to have overstayed his visa and was desperately short of cash, was also described as being hooked on crystal meth as was the woman he was suspected of murdering. The British Embassy said it was not able to comment and police said they were still trying to confirm the identity of the dead man.","Stuart Green, from Manchester, was initially reported to have been arrested .

David Cameron’s father-in-law last night revealed he has had an extraordinary ‘reconciliation’ with Mandy Rice-Davies - the former showgirl who claimed to have had an affair with his father during the Profumo scandal. Miss Rice-Davies famously responded to the third Viscount Astor’s denials of an affair with the immortal line: ‘Well, he would, wouldn’t he?’ Writing in the Spectator magazine his son, the fourth viscount, said his father ‘never recovered his health and died a couple of years later’. 'Charming': Lord Astor said Mandy Rice-Davies, pictured in 1963, was 'absolutely charming and had very kind words to say about my father' after a recent meeting . But Lord Astor said he had an unlikely reconciliation with Miss Rice-Davies at a performance of Andrew Lloyd-Webber’s new musical on the Profumo affair. He said it was a ‘great plus’ to have met her, adding: ‘She was absolutely charming, and had very kind words to say about my father. It was a most unexpected moment - a reconciliation of sorts, and an uplifting footnote after all these years. ‘And what of the accusation? Well any girl of 19 who can get into the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, whether with something true or not true, has to be rather admired.’ Chance encounter: Lord Astor, left, bumped into Mandy Rice-Davies, right, during a performance of Andrew Lloyd-Webber's new musical on the Profumo affair . Lord Astor, stepfather to Samantha Cameron, also revealed that the Profumo affair might never have happened if his father’s filly Ambiguity had not won the Oaks at Epsom in 1953. The proceeds from the win paid for the . heated swimming pool at stately home Cliveden, where John Profumo saw . showgirl Christine Keeler, a friend of Miss Rice-Davies, swimming naked . at a party in July 1961. Third Viscount Astor, pictured at his wedding in London, 'never recovered his health' following the scandal . Mr Profumo, then Secretary of State for War in Harold Macmillan’s government, was forced to resign in 1962 after it emerged he had an affair with Miss Keeler while she was also alleged to be having an affair with the Russian naval attaché Yevgeny Ivanov. Lord Astor said Mr Profumo had met Miss Keeler after a party at Cliveden hosted by his father. When the party relocated to the pool they met with a separate group hosted by his father’s colourful osteopath Stephen Ward, who surrounded himself with young showgirls. ‘Two worlds collided,’ Lord Astor said. ‘First . into the walled garden was Valerie Profumo, who anxiously covered up a . topless Christine Keeler with a towel before the other guests arrived. But Christine had already been spotted by Jack Profumo.’ Lord Astor said his father found Mr Ward’s treatments helped ease his migraines and neuritis. He . said he ‘fell under his spell’ and allowed Mr Ward to live in a cottage . on the estate because ‘it suited him to be treated after hunting on . Saturday’s.’ He went on: ‘I . remember the afternoons by the pool when Ward and his girlfriends came . to swim, with other families from cottages on the estate, usually when . my father and stepmother were away. Party time: Lord Astor said Mr Profumo had met Miss Keeler, right, at a party at Cliveden hosted by osteopath Stephen Ward, centre, pictured also with Penny Marshall, front . Scandal: John Profumo, poses as the new Secretary of State for War, at the War Office before the scandal of his affair with call-girl Christine Keeler broke . 'One of the girls taught me how to do backflips from the diving board, but sadly I don’t remember who she was. All were well-behaved because Nanny Greene, large and in full uniform, presided over the pool sternly. No bad behaviour got past her.’ Lord Astor says that Mr Ward was an ‘arch manipulator’ who was never a great fried of his father. Mr Ward took a fatal overdose while awaiting the verdict on his trial for living off immoral earnings, of which he was later convicted. Miss Rice-Davies’s famous comment was made when she appeared as a witness during the trial. Lord Astor said: ‘It was a scandal that exposed the hypocrisy of the establishment that Ward so offended, exposed the dishonesty of the police and prosecuting authorities and of the security service. But I don’t think there were the real villains or heroes that a musical requires. ‘This is because, in the end, the characters in the Profumo scandal were all victims - victims of a maelstrom that none could escape. Few survived unscathed.’","Former showgirl Mandy Rice-Davies claimed to have had an affair with third Viscount Astor .

As most of the U.S. freezes and the UK drowns in floods, a blistering heat wave in Australia is so bad 100,000 cooked bats have fallen out of the sky, dead. Southern Queensland is being gripped by furnace-like temperatures, said the local RSPCA. This has in turn caused mass deaths with at least 25 separate colonies wiped out since the weekend, including at Mt Ommaney, Redbank, Boonah, Palmwoods, Laidley and Gatton. A blistering heat wave in Australia is so bad 100,000 cooked bats have fallen out of the sky . RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says the heatwave was a significant hit to the population of bats across the state, reports the ABC news station. 'The heatwave was basically a catastrophe for all the bat colonies in south-east Queensland,' he said. 'That's obviously going to have a pretty disturbing impact on those colonies and those colonies are vital to our ecosystem.' The smell of bat carcasses has caused problems for locals. The Scenic Rim Regional Council, west of Brisbane, has organised rubbish collectors to clear up the carcasses of about 2,000 bats. Residents near Boonah's Athol Terrace lookout say they have been putting up with the stench of the dead animals for four days. Southern Queensland is being gripped by furnace-like temperatures, said the local RSPCA . The clear-up: At least 25 separate colonies have been reported dead since the weekend . Hundreds of bats also lie dead in trees and nearby bushes, and are being eaten by maggots. The council today advised local residents it will not send workers into nearby bushland to collect the remaining bat carcasses, as it could cause further disruption to the nearby colony. One resident has told ABC she is receiving anti-viral treatment after being scratched by a baby bat while clearing the dead animals out of her tree with a rake. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says the heatwave was a significant hit to the population of bats across the state, reports the ABC news station . Further north, Lockyer Valley Regional Council says it also faces a massive task of cleaning up thousands of dead bats from around Laidley and Gatton. Sunshine Coast Regional Council has sent workers out to collect thousands more dead bats near Palmwoods. At least 16 people across south-east Queensland are receiving anti-viral treatment after coming into close contact with a bat. Queensland Health is advising people not to touch the animals and to call authorities for help in clearing them away.

Hero: California Target employee, Roxanna Ramirez, pictured, jotted down the license plate number of a customer who gave her a 'weird feeling' Friday, and ended up saving an abducted child . Authorities later hailed the 22-year-old a hero for her quick-thinking. 'He was just fidgeting around. I wasn't getting a good vibe off of him,' she told ABC News. On Tuesday night, the accused kidnapper admitted he snatched the girl from in front of her home in a jailhouse interview with ABC News. Douglas said he did not harm the little girl and claimed the abduction wasn't his idea. He denied having a mental illness and said he believed there was a government conspiracy to control every aspect of his life, which drove him to stalk a number of big-box stores that day, following three different small children. Douglas told the network he took little Natalie because she would be the easiest to grab. 'I actually just walked up to her and she came with me relatively easy, I mean, I appeared to be someone who could be familiar to her, you know, with her ethnicity,' he explained calmly from jail. 'So I just sort of put my hands out, and she was kind of startled but she put her hand out and she just, kind of, came with me. And then she turned back and said, ""mommy"" after we were already getting (in) the car. And that's when her mom came and was alarmed. And I had to kind of hurry up and scoot her out of there.'

Douglas . told ABC that he has been living in the Antioch Marina in his car for . two months after his family kicked him out and he expected the police to . show up there. On the . way there, however, he said he stopped at several hotels, looking for a . more comfortable place for he and the girl to stay.

'He was being a weirdo outside, and I just got a weird feeling,' she told the Times. She became even more alarmed when he parked his gold Toyota Camry next to her own car, she said. 'At one point, he sat in his car and grabbed the steering wheel and started shaking it violently,' Ramirez recalled. 'It was kind of scary.' So she zoomed in the camera on his license plate and took down the number, just in case. the car was gone when she returned from lunch, she said and she promptly forgot about it. But that night,  after her shift, she was at home and her girlfriend noticed on her Facebook account that an Amber Alert had been issued.

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 18:25 EST, 8 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:25 EST, 8 January 2014 . Help: Treasury minister Sajid Javid, pictured, hinted a minimum wage rise would soon be given the green light . The cost to businesses of a big hike in the minimum wage would be offset with tax breaks under plans being drawn up by Conservative ministers. Further cuts to corporation tax or an increase in National Insurance relief could help firms contend with an expected rise in the minimum pay rate. Business leaders broadly back raising the rate, but say it could be hard to implement. Treasury minister Sajid Javid yesterday gave a clear signal that the move, designed to help struggling workers reap the rewards of Britain’s economic recovery, is likely to be given the green light. The minimum wage is £6.31 for over-21s, but in real terms it is now worth the same as in 2004 – and is about ten per cent lower than 2008. Analysis for Downing Street suggests hiking the minimum pay rate by 50p an hour would also save the Government as much as £1billion, because people in work would pay more tax and claim less in benefits. Independent advisers have been asked to look at restoring the value of the rate, which has been undermined since the crash of 2008 and 2009. Mr Javid told the BBC’s Daily Politics programme that there was a strong case for a rise. ‘The Department of Business has asked the Low Pay Commission to look into this. They’re going to report back shortly and we’ll see what they come up with,’ he said. ‘It [the minimum wage] is about 10 per cent lower in real terms than where it was in 2008. I think that’s a strong case to look at it. 'The important thing is that the right people to look at this decision are the Low Pay Commission.’ Squeezed: In real terms minimum wage is now worth the same as in 2004 - and is about ten per cent lower than 2008 . International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: ‘One of the things we tried to do is support hard-working people, it’s been one of the key planks of our long-term economic plan. ‘We’ve supported the minimum wage and . actually it’s looked at by the Low Pay Commission, so there’s been an . independent body that’s looked at that – I think that’s the right thing . to do. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said a minimum wage rise was key plank in a long-term economic plan . ‘But I think we’ve been very clear as a government that we want to see work pay. ‘I think we’ve absolutely  targeted our help on the people on the lowest incomes.’ Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who led a successful campaign to persuade the Chancellor to freeze fuel duty until 2015, said: ‘Although I would like to see it increase with the current level of inflation, I recognise that a significant rise could put jobs at risk, as many small businesses would be unable to afford a rise. 'I believe it is important that we look at the other ways of giving people a living wage, namely cutting people’s taxes and letting them keep more of their salary.’ John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘With confidence returning to most sectors, it makes sense to look at increasing the minimum wage. ‘However, we would urge the Government to tread carefully. In some industries, such as retail and social care, small businesses operate very fine margins and are struggling with rising costs. ‘It is for this reason we have argued that any increase in the national minimum wage this year should not exceed the rate of inflation.’ The Commission’s report is due to be handed to ministers at the end of next month.","Treasury minister Sajid Javid hinted rate could rise from £6.31 for over-21s .

"By . James Slack . and Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 17:25 EST, 8 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:45 EST, 8 January 2014 . Millions of pounds from Britain’s controversial overseas aid budget is being diverted to fund housing and benefits for asylum seekers living in the UK. The Home Office, one of the departments hit hardest by the Chancellor’s spending cuts, is quietly siphoning off around £10million a year. The cash, which is enough to put 200 police officers on the streets, would  otherwise have to be found from the department’s own budget. The Home Office is spending £10million a year on housing, cash support payments and benefits for asylum seekers in the UK . Officials insist the raid on the swollen £11billion international aid budget falls within international rules for development spending. Crucially, it counts towards the contentious Government target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid. The news that not all the money is being sent overseas was welcomed by backbench Tories, who have criticised generous spending by the Department for International Development (DfID). Andrew Percy, Tory MP for Brigg and Goole, said: ‘If we do have to provide this support within our international obligations it is right it should come from the foreign aid budget. ‘It should not come from the Home Office budget which should be spent on policing, immigration and border controls.’ The Mail has long highlighted some of the controversial ways aid is spent. Recipients have, for example, included India and Nigeria, which have their own space programmes. Andrew Percy, MP for Brigg and Goole (left), says it is a good thing that some of the aid budget is being spent at home. David Cameron has refused to reduce the amount given away from 0.7 per cent of GDP . The aid money being taken by the Home Office pays for accommodation for asylum seekers and their families during their first 12 months in the UK. It also funds cash support, or benefits. It can only be claimed by the department if an asylum case is successful. Support for failed asylum seekers does not count towards the 0.7 per cent target, so the Home Office funds it. Spending on a string of other Home Office projects is also being taken from the aid pot. They include the Gateway Protection Programme, which involves officials identifying potential refugees overseas, arranging their travel to the UK and helping them to settle. The Mail can also reveal that the Government is dipping into the aid budget to try to stop the smuggling of prostitutes, sham brides and drugs to the UK. The DfID is funding anti- trafficking programmes in Vietnam, China, Albania, Nigeria, Romania and Poland. The money is being siphoned off from the overseas aid budget, fixed at 0.7 per cent of national GDP, instead of coming from the Home Office (pictured) There is long-standing anger among Tories over the aid pledge, which comes at a time of spending restraint at home. David Cameron has been repeatedly refused to scrap the 0.7 per cent commitment. But last year he hinted at the possibility of the aid budget being used for other purposes, such as peace-keeping defence missions. Last week, it emerged that Britain had hit the Prime Minister’s 0.7 per cent target, spending more than £11.2billion in a year. But it was also revealed that £500million of taxpayers’ money was helping to prop up the most corrupt regimes in the world. A study by the respected organisation Transparency International found that the UK sent funding to all ten of the worst offending nations in 2012 including Somalia, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Syria. The Home Office said its spending was in line with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines on development spending and consistent with practice in other countries.","Home Office is siphoning £10million a year from overseas aid .

A Finnish doctor who used a test banned in 2005 to check whether a feeding tube had been wrongly inserted into an 84-year-old woman has been cleared of any negligence. An inquest into Andriana Georgiou's death found the feeding tube, which was mistakenly placed in her lungs, did contribute to her death on 15 December, 2012. But senior coroner Mary Elizabeth Hassell did not find Dr Kari Saastamoinen guilty of gross negligence - even though he used a whoosh test that was banned in Homerton hospital in east London seven years ago following three patient alerts. Giving a narrative conclusion, the coroner said: 'Mrs Georgiou was an elderly lady and she clearly had some very significant natural disease. 'Having listened very, very carefully to all the evidence, I am persuaded that the misplacement of the naso-gastric tube was a contributing factor. 'I am always going to look at the systems in a situation like this. The systems here weren't perfect, but I do think that the systems were good. 'Having really considered the matter, I am not going to write a report which aims to prevent future death. 'The misplacement of the tube was not detected because of individual error. 'I am satisfied on the balance of probablities the misplacement of the tube caused death, but I am not sure on that. Because I can't be sure, I can't return a verdict of unlawful killing. Sisphiwe Raseluna, a senior staff nurse at Homerton University Hospital (left) and nurse Veronica Dadzie (right) 'In order to find gross negligence, I must say the conduct was so bad that it was criminal and I don't find that.' The inquest at Poplar Coroners Court . heard Mrs Georgiou, who was born in 1928 in Cyprus and was a retired . machine operator, died as a combination of a stroke and the misplacement . of the tube. The medical cause of death given was pneumonia. The coroner continued: 'Andriana . Georgiou died from a combination of natural disease and the consequence . of a misplaced naso-gastric tube. 'The tube was placed and she tested . as having a PH over eight. The senior nurse asked the consultant for an X . ray but he chose to do a whoosh test. He was satisfied it was in the . right place, it was not. 'There was a patient alert in 2005 . and two subsequent alerts directed the practise of using a whoosh test . to detect the position of a naso-gastric tube must cease immediately. The trust found any patient with a PH over five must have a chest X ray. 'Dr Saastamoinen was in contravention . of the firm advice of a senior nurse, in contravention patient safety . alerts dating back seven years, and in contravention of the hospital . trust's clear policy. 'When the misplacement of the tube . was discovered, nearly two litres of fluid was aspirated. The . misplacement caused Mrs Georgiou great distress.' Dr Kari Saastamoinen was asked by a . senior nurse at the Homerton University Hospital to carry out a chest . X-ray after a PH test on the feeding tube showed an abnormal amount. But . the consultant carried out a whoosh test on Andriana Georgiou, which . involves pumping air down a tube and listening for bubbles using a . stethoscope. The . grandmother and retired machinist, who suffered from diabetes and . dementia, died 11 days later on December 15, 2012, from aspiration . pneumonia at the east London hospital. Daughter of Andriana Georgiou (left) and Andriana Georgiou (right) who died 11 days after the whoosh test . Giving . evidence at Poplar Coroners' Court, Dr Saastamoinen claims he was never . shown hospital policy when he started in 2010, and says the whoosh test . is commonly used in Finland where medicine is 'more informal.' But . the inquest heard Dr Saastamoinen did not even attend an induction at . Homerton because he was working at Royal London at the same time and . timing was 'difficult'. He only completed the induction last year. He added: 'I learnt the whoosh test in medical school in 1993. I started medicine in 1993 and worked in Finland until 2010. 'It is a very different system, it is very informal in Finland.' The inquest heard how Dr Saastamoinen . was 'reluctant' to do a chest X-ray because there could be a 24-hour . delay in feeding Mrs Georgiou as the hospital 'doesn't prioritise X-rays . for feeding tubes.' Dr Saastamoinen, who is still working . full time at the hospital, then showed junior doctors how to carry out . the 'rarely used' test as he was not aware it has been discredited. He said: 'I showed them the test because it is something they have never seen because it is so rarely used. 'It's not taught anymore because it is technical and complex. 'I said there is another way of checking the tube and if you do it properly, it is reliable. I said it is not normally done. 'If [I knew] it wasn't recommended, I wouldn't have taught students it. 'For me, it sounded clear and the tube was in the right place and feeding had started.' He continued: 'I accept now it was hospital policy at the time for a chest X-ray. I never saw the trust policy for the tubes. I didn't know how to access trust policies. 'I didn't know the whoosh test had been discredited. The misplaced feeding tube had been a 'contributory factor' in her death, the hearing was told . '[At the time] I thought it was appropriate because I have vast experience and never had any complications. 'Presented with the same decision tomorrow, I wouldn't do the test. I would do the X-ray.' Dr Sasstamoinen also admitted he thought it was 'likely' Mrs Georgiou's health deteriorated as a result of the misplaced tube. Sisphiwe Raseluna, a senior staff . nurse at the Homerton University Hospital in Hackney, east London, said . Dr Saastamoinen had carried out the 'whoosh test' in front of junior . doctors on Mrs Georgio. 'He . did say to the junior doctors that it was not recommended, but he still . felt that the whoosh test was reliable,' Nurse Raseluna told the . inquest. She said the . test dated back to the 'olden days' and it was trust policy to carry . out an X-ray where a test to show whether a feeding tube had been . correctly inserted showed a litmus reading on a patient of over five. In the case of Mrs Georgiou, she said her reading had been eight. Senior coroner Mary Elizabeth Hassell did not find Dr Kari Saastamoinen guilty of gross negligence at Poplar Coroner's Court . 'I . asked Dr Saastamoinen was he going to have an X-ray or not, he said to . me ""no"" because he was happy the tube was in place and he wanted the . patient to be fed as soon as possible,' Ms Raseluna told the inquest. But addressing the inquest Dr Saastamoinen denied having said the whoosh test was 'not recommended.' 'I said there is another way of checking the position of an naso-gastric tube and if you do it properly, it is reliable. I said it is not normally done,' he said. He said he had learned the 'whoosh test' at medical school in Finland and had used it on several occasions in that country without problems. He added that if Nurse Raseluna had informed him that it was trust policy to send a patient for an X-ray in these circumstances he would have complied. The inquest also heard evidence from . Dr Andrea Lehmann, who argued against the post mortem result, which . found the misplaced tube was a contributing factor to Mrs Georgiou's . death. The stroke consultant at Homerton . said: 'Events from the next day would all fit. It would explain the . chest pain and so on but the tube was subsequently removed and there is a . gap of 11 days of the placement of the tube and when the patient passes . away. 'I was a little surprised over the conclusion of the pathologist. I . don't feel there is enough evidence to say it caused Mrs Georgiou's . demise.' She continued: 'I don't think the tube was a corroborating factor to the death.' Mrs Georgiou was admitted to the hospital after suffering a stroke and . had been plagued by ill health long before her death - including being . at risk 'every day' of pneumonia, the inquest heard. Earlier, the inquest heard from staff nurse Veronica Dadzie who reinserted the feeding tube on December 4, 2012, after it had come out of Mrs Georgiou. She said she had contacted Nurse Raseluna to alert her of the litmus reading and asked for her to request a chest X-ray to find out whether the tube was correctly positioned. Dr John White, a specialist clinical negligence lawyer acting for Mrs Georgiou’s family, said they wanted answers as to how such a 'never event' could have happened. Mrs Georgiou lived with her daughter and granddaughter in Tottenham, north London. 'Feeding a patient down a tube misplaced into the lungs is a so-called ""never event"" which means an event that the NHS says it has resolved to prevent ever from occurring by having proper precautions in place,' he said. 'Yet such an event has happened here. Quite understandably, the family are looking for answers as to how this could happen and lead to Mrs Georgiou’s death.' Medical director at the hospital Dr John Coakley passed his wishes on to . the family: 'She was distressed over being admitted to an intensive . care unit, which is a horrible experience for anyone. 'In relatives, I have seen on the ICU, it is a state of post traumatic . stress disorder - it is that level of stress.'Irrespective, this . incident clearly had an impact. It led to admission in ICU and was . associated with her death. 'All the family understood her life expectancy was limited but this is something they felt very bad about.' Dr Coakley assured the coroner steps have been at the hospital - . including documents on feeding tubes - since Mrs Georgiou's death.","Andriana Georgiou, 84, admitted to Homerton Hospital on Dec 4, 2012 .

A 21-month-old boy was taken to hospital after he tried to eat potentially fatal diabetes pills that had been pushed through the wrong letterbox by a local pharmacy. Zubayr Naeem, of Blackburn, Lancashire, was attracted to the chocolate-coloured medication he found near the front door, and put two tablets in his mouth. The boy was about to swallow them when his 37-year-old father Mohammed Naeem arrived home and fished them out of his mouth after realising what he had done. Taken to hospital: Zubayr Naeem, of Blackburn, Lancashire, put two tablets in his mouth - when his when his 37-year-old father Mohammed Naeem (pictured together) arrived home and fished them out . Zubayr took Trajenta pills, which improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. They were addressed to a neighbour, but had been delivered in error by a local pharmacy. Riaz Pharmacy said medication should not be posted through a letterbox, and said a driver had been suspended. The boy’s father, a CCTV installer, is now taking legal advice. The pills lower blood sugar over time and, in a child under two, would have caused a coma and probable death if swallowed and no antidote or sugar was administered swiftly, doctors said. Mr Naeem returned home to find Zubayr pushing two tablets into his mouth in the hallway. His wife Yasmin, cooking in the kitchen, was unaware the drugs had been posted through the letterbox. Potentially fatal: Zubayr took Trajenta pills, which improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes . Mr Naeem rang the NHS 111 line and was told to take his son to A&E at Royal Blackburn Hospital. Zubayr was kept in overnight. 'I was really scared. He could have died. This should never have happened' Mohammed Naeem . Three days later, father-of-four Mr Naeem took his son to his GP for a check-up after he carried on crying and seemed distressed. He said: ‘I was really scared. He could have died. This should never have happened. They should never have just pushed such dangerous drugs through a letterbox instead of handing them to someone. ‘These pills looked just like chocolates and my son was far too young to know not to eat them.’ Pharmacy manager Riaz Hinglotowala said: ‘This issue is currently under investigation to find out exactly what happened. These drugs should not have been pushed through a letterbox. Wrong door: The pills were addressed to a neighbour, but had been delivered in error by a local pharmacy . ‘Our policy is to give them to an individual and if no-one is present leave a note asking them to ring us to arrange delivery. The driver has been suspended.’ Trajenta, also known as Linagliptin, is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is a condition that affects almost 3million people in Britain, causing their blood sugar level to get too high. Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body producing insufficient insulin to properly function - or cells not reacting to insulin.

The ham-fisted thief was filmed trying to smash his way through a Post Office's toughened glass screen and two reinforced doors before clambering through a ceiling to snatch just a few pounds from the counter. Moments earlier he was seen pacing up and down the street in Failsworth, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, where he was overheard muttering, 'I have no money - may as well do the Post Office'. Scroll down for video . It begins: This is the moment the thief entered the Watchcote Post Office in Failsworth, near Oldham . Gotta get that cash: As customers are still being served, the robber tries to pull open the locked door to the back . Just ask... Foiled by the lock on the door, the hapless robber tries demanding money from the cashiers . Next: Staff aren't having it, so the thief misguidedly tries to use a plastic lottery ticked stand to smash through . He then burst into the Watchcote Post . Office so determined to rob it that, after staff refused his demands to . hand over the cash, he tried four different ways to get behind the . counter. First he tried to . pull open the door to the back. Finding it unsurprisingly locked, he . turned to the cashiers and demanded they hand over the cash, vainly . punching the reinforced glass screen. Next . he picked up a plastic National Lottery ticket stand and tried to use . it as a battering ram to shatter the toughened glass screen. When . that failed, he vainly tried again to open the secure doors to the back, . trying to kick his way through one of them.  And finally he climbed . onto a shelf and started pulling polystyrene tiles from the false . ceiling. Despite almost . getting stuck when his legs fell through the ceiling frame, the . determined robber was able to clamber through the roof void as staff . cowered in a back room after activating a panic alarm.

Officers . believe the man was seen before the robbery outside the Post Office, . where he made several comments about his financial position, including . comments about not being able to buy Christmas presents for children. Police described balaclava-clad bandit as white, of a pale complexion, about six foot tall, and in his 20s. He was also said to have wide, pale blue eyes and was wearing a black woollen balaclava, blue tracksuit and thick black gloves. A cunning plan: The thief realises that he might be able to gain access to the back via the roof . A breakthrough: After removing several tiles he makes his way into the ceiling void . Not quite plain sailing: Before he can get in, the robbers legs fall through the fragile polystyrene tiles .

The BBC’s expenses bill for its top executives has increased by nearly 50 per cent in just three months, fuelled by a huge surge in the amount spent on flights. Last night the broadcaster blamed the move of its payroll operations to India and the number of international conferences for the increase in flight costs. However, the cost of taxis and rail tickets were also up on the previous three month period. The BBC yesterday claimed most of the expenses were 'unavoidable routine costs' but said it was 'mindful' of spending public money' The latest disclosure reveals that in the quarter to the end of December last year the total expenses bill for its top bosses hit £206,401 up from almost £139,000 in the previous period and also up, by about 20 per cent on the same period last year. The cost of flights, which took in cities including Washington, Dallas, Delhi and Johannesburg, nearly doubled from £33,949 in the same quarter in 2011 to £65,654 in 2012. Rail fares, many of which paid to ferry bosses between London and its new Salford base, were 15 per cent up from the previous period to £39,980, but were down on the equivalent period from the previous year. Taxis, which saw some bosses repeatedly rack up large fares, at times topping £100, hit £32,948, which was up by more than 10 per cent on the previous period. The BBC yesterday claimed most of the expenses were ‘unavoidable routine costs’ but said it was ‘mindful’ of spending public money. But it was unable to provide figures as to how much the cost of flights had gone up on the previous three month period. While the year on year figure for hotels - £26,000 - was slightly down there were still lots of claims for people staying in hotels near the MediaCity base in Salford . While the year on year figure for hotels - £26,000 - was slightly down there were still lots of claims for people staying in hotels near the MediaCity base in Salford. Jonathan Isaby, Political Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘BBC bosses need to focus on delivering value for licence fee payers’ cash and these latest expense claims will not instil public confidence that they are doing so. ‘They need to cut down on unnecessary expenditure and in an age where video-conferencing and Skype make international communication extremely cheap and easy, spending on flights should be significantly reduced. ‘Licence fee payers expect their money to be spent on making quality programmes, not flying the BBC top brass around the world to attend a succession of conferences.’ Among the more eye-catching claims was Radio 3 controller Roger Wright’s £450 for an external private dinner for ‘Free Thinking Contributors’ in November. Radio 3 holds a Free Thinking Festival and for the dinner there said to have been nine people attending. Taxis, which saw some bosses repeatedly rack up large fares, at times topping £100, hit £32,948, which was up by more than 10 per cent on the previous period . Acting director of news Fran Unsworth claimed for a £2,400 return flight to Dehli in November and also a £2,195 flight to Johannesburg in August. The corporation’s human resources chief Lucy Adams spent £446 discussing ideas for ‘staff engagement’ with eight people. Creative director Alan Yentob claimed for a £1,867.20 flight to Los Angeles. Marketing chief Philip Almond spent £126 on a taxi for ‘Attending D&AD’s 50th anniversary event’ and then £117.34 cab fare to go to the Sports Personality of the Year. The BBC’s entertainment boss also claimed for high priced taxi fares including one for £112.67 and another for £142.72. The BBC boss of the corporation’s programme-making arm Pat Younge spent £405 on business entertainment for ‘Networking/reflection at the end of training’, but it was for 28 people. BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie racked up a hotel bill for £811 for five nights. The disclosure also included the latest entries in the hospitality register for top bosses. Director of BBC North Peter Salmon was a guest of Manchester City Football Club when he went to watch them play Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League. The new TV chief Danny Cohen, formerly BBC1 boss was given a box of wine by Mrs Merton comedienne Caroline Aherne. He then distributed it ‘among the BBC One team’. He is said to have also received Christmas presents from independent companies all below £50 in value. Similarly the BBC’s new comedy boss Shane Allen received champagne from three production companies but in each case ‘Donated to charity’. The expenses also showed that the BBC’s head of editorial standards David Jordan was forced to abandon his attendance at the Society of Editor’s Annual Conference, for which he had booked flights, at the height of the Savile crisis. A BBC spokesperson said: ‘The majority of these expenses are unavoidable routine costs incurred in running a major international broadcasting organisation. Whilst there will inevitably be fluctuation in spend from year to year we are mindful that we are spending public money and are working hard to keep these costs to a minimum.’",The BBC yesterday claimed most of the expenses were 'unavoidable routine costs' but said it was 'mindful' of spending public money .

When it comes to illness, men and women really do react differently, Italian researchers have found. They say there are five areas in which there are significant differences between the sexes - and are calling for doctors to be more aware of how the symptoms vary. The study findings show that when men have a heart attack, chest pain that radiates down the left arm is the standard symptom. However women under cardiac arrest display nausea and lower abdominal pain. Study leader Professor Giovannella Baggio, of at Padua University Hospital  and Director of the hospital's Internal Medicine Unit, said that women often did not receive the treatment they needed when displaying these symptoms. 'Our research highlights evidence for considerable differences between the sexes in five domains - cardiovascular disease, cancer, liver diseases, osteoporosis, and pharmacology. 'At the dawn of third millennium medical researchers still know very little about gender-specific differences in illness, particularly when it comes to disease symptoms, influencing social and psychological factors, and the ramifications of these differences for treatment and prevention. 'Medical research conducted over the past 40 years has focused almost exclusively on male patients. 'Typically perceived as a male illness, cardiovascular disease often displays markedly different symptoms among women. 'While a constricted chest and pain that radiates through the left arm are standard signs of heart attack in men, in women the usual symptoms are nausea and lower abdominal pain. 'Although heart attacks in women are more severe and complicated, when complaining of these non-specific symptoms women often do not receive the necessary examination procedures, such as an ECG , enzyme diagnostic tests or coronary angiography.' The study, published in the journal Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine also highlights how colon cancer affects women much later in life than men and the tumours appear in different areas. Heart attack symptoms in women and men are now known to be remarkably different. Typical warning signs of chest pain that radiates down the left arm is common in men, but women suffer nausea and abdominal pain . These tumours also respond better to some chemicals than men’s and there are also different responses between the sexes to chemotherapy on a number of cancers. When it comes to the liver, women are much more likely than men to get primary biliary cirrhosis and both this and chronic hepatitis C have a higher risk factor because of female hormones. And with osteoporosis primarily occurring in women, it is often overlooked in men, leading to a higher number of bone fractures. Even the body shape of sexes plays a part with a big variation between men and women when it comes to the effect of drugs such as aspirin. These are attributable to different body types, varying reaction times in the absorption and elimination of substances, and a fundamentally different hormonal status. To administer medication safely and effectively, the dosage and duration of treatment must take the patient’s gender into account. Prof Baggio added: 'The study concludes that additional and more far-reaching clinical investigations of gender differences are needed in order to eliminate fundamental inequalities between men and women in the treatment of disease.'","Medical research conducted over the past 40 years has focused almost exclusively on male patients, say Italian researchers .

A new British-built family runaround which bosses claim is ‘the world’s best self-parking car’ has won What Car's Car Of The Year award. The second-generation Nissan Qashqai crossover – which hits showrooms next month - was also named best small sports utility vehicle in the annual ceremony. The new vehicle, which starts at £17,595 comes packed with technology, including 360-degree parking camera which gives a top-down bird’s eye view of the car and is position, as well as Intelligent Park Assist which steers the vehicle into a parallel parking bay. The new Nissan Qashqai, which goes on sale next month and costs £17,595, has been named Car Of The Year by What Car? Nissan executives say that the level technology in the new Qashqai means it is already fitted with the ‘building blocks’ needed for a self-driving car which the Japanese car maker intended to introduce by 2020. They say the aim is to create a car with ‘zero fatalities.’ Judges praised the attention to detail of the Japanese car-firm’s crossover, which was also designed and engineered in  the UK, and said the quality of workmanship was a feather in the cap for Nissan’s 6,100-strong workforce at the factory in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear. It is the first time that Nissan has won the overall top accolade in the What Car? Car of the Year awards sponsored by Warranty Direct which were held last night among an audience of motor industry VIPs and top executives at  the Grosvenor House on London’s Park Lane. What Car? editor-in-chief Chas Hallett said: ‘The all-new Nissan Qashqai brings excellence and polish to a class of cars that was already brimming with talent and tempting buys. The car was designed and built in Britain by workers in Nissan's Sunderland plant . ‘The Qashqai delivers low costs and first-class levels of comfort, refinement, space and safety. Nissan has thought of every last detail and it’s this complete approach that rewards it the overall 2014 What Car? Car of the Year. The Nissan team at the Sunderland plant should be justifiably proud of their achievement.’ Briton Andy Palmer, Nissan’s global chief planning officer, said: 'This is a massive vote of confidence in Britain and for Sunderland. The plant now produces more cars than the whole of Italy. It’s one of the best in the world. It encapsulates our mission to create cars which innovate and excite.’ As well as being built in Sunderland, the new Qashqai  was designed at Nissan’s European design centre in London’s Paddington and  engineered at the car-giants technical centre at Cranfield in Bedfordshire. It had its global unveiling in London in November by Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn who flew in from Japan. Nissan  says that the launch of new Qashqai – together with new Note which went on sale in October – will drive production at the Sunderland factory to new record levels well beyond 550,000 in 2014. The first generation of the Qashqai was quickly nicknamed the ‘cash-cow’ because of its success in generating  money for Nissan. Some 250,000 first generation Qashqais have been sold in UK since it's launch in 2007, with more than 2 million have been sold worldwide .

Other features include traffic sign recognition which flashes up speed limits on the dashboard, Moving Object Detection warns of people or cars crossing the  vehicle’s path when reversing, Lane Departure warning which tells the driver if he or she drifts out of motorway lane without indicating and Blind Spot Warning which tells drivers if an overtaking car is approaching out of view. A special Front Collision Avoidance system scans the road ahead using radar and, depending on speed,  can bring car to a full stop if collision is imminent. Dozy drivers are given a wake-up call thanks to special monitors which check the motorist’s steering activity and warns if he or she is about to fall asleep at the wheel. The car also has a 7-inch touchscreen which  integrates satnav, phone and Bluetooth music streaming. All engines will have ‘stop-start’  as standard, cutting out the power when idling at traffic lights to save fuel.  The lowest CO2 emissions will be 99g/km  on a 1.5-litre diesel managing 74.3miles to the gallon. The Sunderland factory employs more than 6,100 and also builds the Note, Juke and all-electric LEAF models. In December Nissan announced  a £250million investment to  build a brand new luxury  hatchback in Sunderland – the Infiniti Q30 creating 1,000 new jobs. Nissan Motor GB’s managing director Jim Weight said they were ‘thrilled’ with the award: ‘A huge amount of effort has gone into the design and engineering of the new car and we’re all extremely excited.’","New Qashqai has been named Car Of The Year at What Car? awards .

David Cameron showed how being Prime Minister is like child’s play today, as he strolled along Whitehall carrying a doll. The Premier was spotted with the toy as he tried to catch up with his daughter Florence while she scooted through central London. Mr Cameron took the three-year-old to nursery in Westminster before rushing back to Number 10 to chair Cabinet. Toy story: David Cameron was out early this morning carrying a doll in Whitehall as he took daughter Florence to nursery . Downing Street insiders had promised the New Year would see a major push by the Tories to seize the political initiative. Mr Cameron used an interview on Sunday to insist he was ‘trying to help hardworking people’ as he promised to protect increases in the state pension and curb benefits being sent across the EU. Yesterday Chancellor George Osborne used a major speech to warn of ‘tough choices’ in the year ahead. But the flurry of activity appeared to grind to a halt today, with the major announcement from Mr Cameron’s ministers being Environment Secretary Owen Paterson telling people to eat more British fruit and vegetables. One of the biggest political stories of the day has been the news that the Premier’s hairdresser received a gong in the New Year’s Honour’s list. Lino Carbosiero, a hairdresser to the stars, has been given an MBE. Childminding: Mr Cameron has made a point of taking his daughter to nursery as often as he can . Late?

Wrapped up: Ministers spotted attending Cabinet today included (l-r) Foreign Secretary William Hague, Education Secretary Michael Gove and Home Secretary Theresa May . After dropping Florence at her nursery, Mr Cameron returned to Downing Street to chair Cabinet. He updated ministers on his pre-Christmas trip to Afghanistan, telling them ‘there is significant progress being made in the strength and resilience of the Afghan national security forces” and that “the UK’s drawdown of combat troops is absolutely on track’. There was also discussion of the demand from Mr Osborne to find an extra £12billion in welfare spending over two years to 2017-18.","David Cameron seen clutching toy on early morning walk in London .

Micaela Harris, 24, of Invercargill, New Zealand ordered an extra cake for her engagement party, but after a disagreement between her sister and the cake maker, the result left a bad taste. The baker, Emma McDonald, is said to have become annoyed at Harris’s sister for not specifying what type of cake she wanted, and sent her a pile of ‘chocolate poo’ with a flag stuck in it, telling the party guests to ‘eat s***’.

When Pamela Beck, from Pinellas Park, put her bags down to pay for her coffee on Saturday afternoon, a loaded gun she had forgotten about fired from her handbag. The bullet from the .25 caliber semi-automatic Titan handgun hit Amie Peterson, 38, above the knee as the friends waited in line at the Tyrone Square Mall Starbucks in St Petersburg, Florida. Friendly fire: Pamela Beck was at this Starbucks in Tyrone Square Mall, Florida, when she accidentally shot her friend Amie Peterson . Mike Puetz, a St Petersburg police spokesman, told The Huffington Post that when Ms Beck, 51, put her bag down it 'hit the ground hard', causing the gun to fire. The Florida woman, who police say does not have a concealed carry weapons permit, had been given the gun by her father about a year ago and did not mean to bring it out with her, Bay News 9 said. 'She had forgotten about it,' Mr Puetz said. Ms Peterson was taken to a nearby medical centre for treatment. The case has been referred to prosecutors. A spokesman for Starbucks told 10News: . 'The safety and security of our partners who are our employees and . customers is our top priority. We are aware of the accident that took . place and are thankful that nobody was seriously injured.' Concealed: Ms Beck had forgotten that the Titan .25 caliber handgun was in her handbag . She added: 'We wish those involved a speedy recovery and at this time we are working with local authorities and defer any specific questions on the investigation to them.' It is the latest in a series of accidental shootings this month. A three-year-old boy shot himself and died after finding his uncle's gun in a bedroom; a two-year-old girl in Kentucky was shot dead by her brother; and a six-year-old girl from Fort Lauderdale was seriously injured when her brother found a handgun.It is not the first time that a gun has fired accidentally from a woman's handbag in Starbucks. In 2011, the Associated Press reported on a girl whose gun went off in her bag, nearly hitting customers. The coffee chain has been criticised in the past by the anti-gun lobby for refusing to ban armed customers. American businesses are allowed to ban customers who are carrying guns, but Starbucks says that it respects local and state laws. In a statement on gun laws, released on its website in 2010, Starbucks said: 'The political, policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and courts, not in our stores.' In 2010, 73,505 Americans had to seek emergency hospital treatment for gunshot wounds in 2010, according to figures by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a national group promoting smart gun laws. Recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show almost seven people are wounded by gunfire every 60 minutes in the U.S.","Florida woman forgot loaded gun was in her bag .

Fantasist: Juliet Clarke told a string of bizarre lies to fleece her boyfriends out of thousands of pounds . A 'female Walter Mitty' who conned boyfriends out thousands of pounds by pretending to be pregnant, dying of cancer and even dead has narrowly avoided prison. Juliet Clarke, 31, told a string of . bizarre lies to fleece her partners out of £7,000 then spent the . money on hair extensions, hotels and holidays. Unemployed Clarke, from Launceston in Cornwall, first tricked Ricky Yelland into thinking she had terminal cancer and was about to inherit £250,000, Plymouth Crown Court heard. He gave her access to his bank account but after the couple split up noticed over £2,500 had been spent without his permission. Mr Yelland asked for the money back but Clarke then sent him a series of texts pretending to be her own father saying she was dead - and even discussing funeral arrangements. One message said: 'Ricky this is Bob, I suppose you have heard the news now'. Mr Yelland only discovered Clarke was still alive when he when he looked her up on Facebook and found references to a new boyfriend. Clarke told her next victim Wayne Teare that she was suffering from ovarian and cervical cancer. When Mr Teare later tried to break off their relationship, she claimed she was pregnant with twins and even sent him a fake picture from a birthing manual from the New York Times. Mr Teare’s mother was so convinced she was about to become a grandmother that she went out to buy baby clothes, the court heard. Judge Paul Darlow told Clarke her lies were 'born from a desire to remain the centre of attention.' But she walked free from court after he decided to suspend her ten-month jail sentence for two years. She admitted three offences of fraud by false representation between October and December 2011 at an earlier hearing. Attention seeker: A judge told Juliet Clarke (pictured beneath coat) that her lies were 'born from a desire to remain the centre of attention'. Her 10-month prison sentence was suspended for two years . The judge told her: 'You are well-versed in playing on the sympathies of others with false illnesses and false conditions.' He added: 'Your conduct was deliberately fraudulent, mean spirited, targeted and devious. Whether you and I meet again is up to you... If you commit any offences in the next two years, you and I will meet and you will go to prison.' The court heard Clarke and Mr Yelland dated for around eight months and moved in together in 2011. Prosecutor Julia Cox said Clarke won his sympathy by claiming she was being treated for cancer and by saying she was on the verge of inheriting £250,000 from her grandmother. Miss Cox told the hearing: 'He believed she was being sincere until November 2011 when he obtained some bank statements.' She added: 'He realised there were numerous charges he had not authorised - bills for hotels, a holiday, mobile phone top-ups.' Elaborate: Juliet Clarke (left) told a boyfriend she was dying and even pretended to be her father Bob (right) when discussing funeral plans via text . Mr Yelland and Clarke had split up by then but he contacted her asking about his missing £2,558. The texts went on to ask Mr Yelland for his bank details because Clarke had supposedly left him money in her will. Miss Cox said the pair discussed funeral arrangements but Mr Yelland grew suspicious and found out via Facebook she was very much alive and dating Mr Teare. Clarke met Mr Teare, a serviceman, over the internet while he was serving in Afghanistan and they began a relationship when he arrived back in the UK. She borrowed money for a fictional uncle’s funeral and demanded more after they split up in January 2012, claiming she was pregnant with twins. Clarke sent Mr Teare a picture from the New York Times Pregnancy Guide to show off her supposedly swollen stomach. When he and his mother became suspicious, Clarke sent them pictures and details about a pair of premature twins - including their names and medical conditions. Investigations later proved Clarke was never pregnant and had in fact been sterilised. Paul Rowsell, defending, admitted she was like a 'female Walter Mitty character' but unlike the fictional character she lived out her fantasies at the expense of others. Clarke also asked for four similar offences to be taken into consideration. She will remain under probation supervision and will have to complete an education and training course.","Juliet Clarke, 31, told string of bizarre lies to con boyfriends out of money .

Mr Mann got the medication two hours later after driving back to the GP surgery and waiting for another prescription to be printed in English which he then took back to the pharmacy. But baby Harley's condition worsened and he had to be admitted to hospital for treatment the next morning. Writing on Facebook earlier this week, Mr Mann said: 'I can’t believe Morrisons wouldn’t give us Harley’s prescription for a chest infection today because it was in Welsh. 'No other pharmacist in Bangor or Caernarfon had what he needed so we had to go back to the surgery to get it changed.' He later added: 'Unfortunately Harley was admitted to hospital this morning.

A labourer swung his pet kitten around by her tail - because his naughty nephew was visiting and the pet needed to get used to it, a court heard. Cruel Matthew Coffin, 27, picked his tabby kitten Daisy up and span her around his bedsit to show off to friends. Shocked, they returned the next day and filmed him abusing the domestic shorthair cat on a mobile phone and reported him to the RSPCA. Scroll down for video . Cruel: Matthew Coffin, 27, picked his tabby kitten Daisy up and span her around his bedsit to show off to friends . The clip shows Coffin grinning as he grabs Daisy and bounces her around while sitting with his partner on the sofa in their flat. Ban: Coffin, of Southampton, Hampshire, was banned from keeping animals for 10 years . Magistrates today banned Coffin from keeping any animals for 10 years after he pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering. They also ordered him to serve 150 hours of unpaid work under a 12-month community order and pay £150 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. Prosecutor Sarah Wheadon, representing the RSPCA, told the court his behaviour was 'totally inappropriate'. Ms Wheadon said: 'In a vet’s opinion, suffering was caused for the period Daisy was bounced and swung by her tail and this suffering was unnecessary. 'If it had continued as shown it is very likely she would have sustained injury. 'A responsible owner would realise that treating Daisy in this way was totally inappropriate.' RSPCA Inspector Penny Baker, who removed the cats with police officers, welcomed the sentence. Inspector Baker said: 'The video, taken by Coffin’s friend, clearly shows him swinging the cat by its tail on several occassions. He said his young nephew was coming to stay and pulled cats tails so he was getting Daisy used to it. 'This is a terribly heartless thing to do and I was shocked when I saw the video of him pulling her up and down several times. 'What makes it worse is that he had done this the previous day and was happy to repeat it. 'I am very pleased with the sentence as it shows how seriously magistrates took the offence he committed, which was clearly a deliberate act.'

Adoption: Daisy and Coffin's other cat, an older black male named Charlie, are both available for adoption . Vets X-rayed ‘timid’ Daisy and found no lasting damage, Inspector Baker said. She and Coffin’s other cat, an older black male named Charlie, are both available for adoption. Inspector Baker added: 'I found poor Daisy very timid, but since she has been in our care she’s become a lot more friendly. 'Had this mistreatment gone on as she grew and got much bigger, there’s a far stronger chance she could have been badly injured. 'Coffin lifted Daisy up entirely by her tail, and the weight of this could have really hurt her. 'He admitted in court that he was basically showing off.' Magistrates also ruled Coffin’s other pets - two hamsters and a bearded dragon - must be confiscated within seven days. Daisy: The cat was very frightened when it was taken in but has become more friendly now . Sentence: Coffin will serve 150 hours of unpaid work, pay £150 costs and a £60 victim surcharge . Sentencing, the bench chairwoman said: 'We regard these offences as so serious that you should be disqualified from keeping any animals, birds or reptiles for 10 years.' Jonathan Driver, mitigating, said Coffin accepts he should have realised Daisy could have been harmed. Mr Driver told the court: 'My client did not appreciate that he was exposing Daisy to risk of harm and he accepts that he should have. 'This is a case of misguided inappropriate behaviour rather than anything malicious or sinister.' Coffin, from Southampton, Hampshire, committed the offences in September last year.","Matthew Coffin, 27, picked his tabby kitten Daisy up and span her around .

A mother threatened a student with a ten-inch blade and dug her nails into another woman's hand in a series of robberies to fund her £300-a-day heroin habit, a court has heard. Victoria Oddy, 27, was caught by residents who overpowered her after she was seen threatening the student who was walking home from the gym. Oddy, from Horsforth, Leeds, was jailed for three years and 11 months yesterday at Leeds Crown Court after pleading guilty to two offences of robbery, attempted robbery and the possession of an offensive weapon. The court heard Oddy’s victims were left badly traumatised by the attacks and one still suffers from anxiety and struggles to sleep. Prosecutor Duncan Ritchie told the court the first attack took place on June 17 as the victim walked along a path at about 7.45pm. Oddy ran up behind the victim and grabbed her before demanding her mobile phone. She told the woman: 'I have got a knife, I’m going to stab you.' She punched the woman in the face but the victim managed to run off and raise the alarm. Oddy then attacked a 25-year-old woman on the evening of July 3, lunging at the woman as she was on her phone. She dug her nails into the woman’s hand during the attack before making off with with the phone. The court also heard someone managed to access the victim’s Facebook account shortly after the incident and she had a threatening message e-mailed to her which stated: 'We know where you live.' Oddy was caught on July 18 after she attacked a student who was walking home from the gym. Oddy held a knife to the woman’s throat and the blade snapped off as the victim tried to defend herself - but residents in a nearby house saw the attack and helped detain Oddy. Oddy was jailed at Leeds Crown Court (pictured) after pleading guilty to two offences of robbery, attempted robbery and the possession of an offensive weapon . Oddy refused to comment when interviewed about the offences. She was later picked out at an identity procedure. Narinder Rathour, mitigating, said the offences were committed at a time when Oddy had a £300-a-day drug addiction and was in fear of dealers. He said Oddy accepted full responsibility for her offending and was full of shame at what she had done. 'This was a disgraceful and very frightening set of offences, fuelled no doubt by the serious addiction you had at the time' - Recorder David Osborne . He said her father died of cancer in 2011 and two days later she discovered she was pregnant to a partner who subsequently abducted her and held her prisoner. The lawyer said Oddy was responding well to treatment in prison, had developed an interest in fitness and gym sport and had no intention of returning to abusing drugs. Jailing Oddy, Recorder David Osborne said: 'This was a disgraceful and very frightening set of offences, fuelled no doubt by the serious addiction you had at the time. You have caused lasting harm to the people you robbed.' Referring to the extent of her drug addiction, he said: 'She had a £300 a day habit. 'That is £110,000 per year. It is a huge amount of money that needs to be acquired to feed that addiction.'","Victoria Oddy threatened student with a ten-inch blade in one robbery .

Kevin Christie has been jailed for 12 months at Preston Crown Court for leading a seedy double life . A respected teacher’s career lay in ruins today after he was jailed for leading a seedy double life as an internet predator who stalked teenage girls using online messaging services. Married Kevin Christie, 40, secretly got his thrills in between classes at his Church of England primary school by posing as a 25-year-old sports coach to engage girls in 'sex chats' on Blackberry Messenger and Skype. One youngster of 16 sent Christie a topless picture of herself after he told her she was 'truly beautiful and he had fallen for her'. Another girl aged just 13 and who lived in Scotland was asked what sexual experiences she had with her boyfriend. Christie, a Year 3 teacher at the 538 pupil Baines Endowed Primary School near Blackpool, Lancashire, was arrested after the 13-year-old’s mother found sexually explicit messages on her daughter’s mobile phone. Police found over 320,000 lines of Skype instant messages under his Skype username. His wife, neighbours and teaching colleagues were unaware of his activities. At Preston Crown Court, Christie bowed his head in shame as he was jailed for 12 months. He pleaded guilty to inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and possessing an indecent photograph of a child. He has since been sacked from his job. None of the girls were pupils at his school. Prosecuting, Mercedeh Jabbari said the Blackberry Messenger chat with the 13-year old Scottish schoolgirl had taken place between January 18 and February 22 last year after Christie initiated it by saying, 'Hey how are you I’m Jamie, 25, M, UK'. The girl responded with her name adding that she was 13, F (female) and from Scotland. Christie would say how the girl looked older than her age and that her 'boyfriend is lucky'. One message read: 'He must love getting on you'. The prosecutor said the messages continued in an explicit manner with Christie asking what sexual experience she had and encouraged her to elaborate on it. When she responded 'poked', he asked 'like that?' Adding, 'you need to do it more if it was just alright'. He also said: 'You do it to yourself too I hope.' Police later searched Christie’s home in Thornton-in-Cleveleys which he shared with his wife and seized his Blackberry and computer tower. He was arrested and later suspended from his job. In interview Christie accepted there was Blackberry messaging between him and the girl despite knowing she was only 13. Miss Jabbari added: 'He denied obtaining any sexual gratification and said he regularly conversed with girls. But what is clear, the conversations are of a sexual nature and are to females. 'He had engaged in conversation with the 16-year-old between 25th February and 1st March 2013. They were of a sexual nature, he called himself Jamie Johnson and told her she was truly beautiful and that he had fallen for her. 'Having been told by her that she was taking a course in sport he said he was also a sports coach and personal trainer and offered to help her. He asked to see her pants and all of her. The conversation led to him asking her to remove her top and she has sent that image of herself. Christie was a Year 3 teacher at the 538-pupil Baines Endowed Primary School near Blackpool, Lancashire . 'He admitted to making these calls and it had become a habit and a problem for him.' The court heard Christie never met up with any of the girls but eventually accepted he had obtained sexual gratification. In mitigation Mr Robert Golinski said: 'There is a sense of bafflement of those around him of how he came to commit this kind of offence. 'It is not something anybody who knew him had the slightest suspicion of. His pleas are accompanied by genuine remorse for his actions and genuine shame at the way he has conducted himself. He has as a result of his actions lost everything. 'He has lost obviously his good name, he’s an educated man, he had a good job and good career prospects and is a man of positive good character. He has also lost his marriage, the relationship of 17 years.' Mr Golinski said Christie’s marriage was in difficulty towards the end of 2011 and he had been in a fragile mental health state, suffering a breakdown in October 2011. He added: 'He effectively retreated into himself online and created his own virtual reality with an alternative personality where he was able to justify to himself. 'He didn’t understand the seriousness of what he was engaged in. He made no efforts to contact the girls or obtain their addresses and contact details. There was no physical contact between him and the child.' Christie was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register for a period of ten years, and was given a Sexual Offences Prevention Order until further order. Passing sentence Judge Pamela Badley said: 'You engaged in a deliberate policy of seeking out a child who was young enough to be interested in engaging in sexual chat with someone who you pretended to be. Messaging: Christie said there was messaging between them despite knowing she was 13 . 'In real life you are a 40-year-old man with plenty of experience of life and indeed detailed knowledge about children through your work. 'You were undergoing some problems in your relationship and you sought the virtual reality into the seedy world in which you felt you were able to engage with the young girl pretending to be someone else. 'There has been some suggestion that you were somewhat naive and didn’t understand the seriousness, I find that hard to accept. Your whole career has to do with looking after the welfare of children.' Judge Badley said the messages had been a 'deliberate encounter'. 'The fact is that you sought to engage with a 13-year-old in sexualised talk, it was a deliberate encounter in which you engaged upon. This was certainly something unknown to your colleagues, your wife and neighbours - all of whom considered you to be an entirely respectable individual. 'The lie you were maintaining was that you spent a considerable amount of time involved in Skype over sexualised nature. 'You did not touch this child but you engaged with her in a way, sometimes called mind games. undoubtedly it will have an effect on her in the future when she realises what was taking place. 'You are well thought of by those who you weren’t aware of the activities you were undertaking. There is a deep revulsion for those who seek out remote sexual activity with young girls - this is something which was clearly a sexual thrill as far as you were concerned. 'You were someone who was employed for the welfare of children. You had a considerable amount of trust placed on you by members of the community. You engaged upon this communication quite deliberately - the gravity of this is to be marked by immediate custody.' After the case Det Sgt Kevin Wright of Lancashire Police said: 'Christie’s actions were reprehensible, using technology to prey on two young girls in separate parts of the country for his own gratification. 'This behaviour will no doubt horrify members of the public, particularly those who are parents of teenage girls, and it is right Christie has been jailed for his actions.'","Kevin Christie, 40, posed as a 25-year-old sports coach to message girls .

Britain has made less progress in tackling obesity than the United States, Jeremy Hunt said. The Health Secretary claimed that Barack Obama’s White House has ‘started to turn the tide on obesity’, leaving the UK behind. It is a stark admission by a British politician that attempts to get the nation to shed the pounds have not worked, as he urged some ‘national soul-searching’ about the problem. By 2050 half of women, almost two thirds of men and a quarter of children are predicted to be obese by Public Health England (photo posed by models) Twenty years ago just 13 per cent of men and 16 per cent of women were classed as obese, but the rates have almost doubled to 24 and 26 per cent. By 2050 half of women, almost two thirds of men and a quarter of children are predicted to be obese by Public Health England. By comparison 70 per cent of people are already classed as overweight and 31 per cent are obese. The NHS has warned that the statistics paint ‘an alarming picture that reveals that the obesity epidemic in England shows no signs of abating anytime soon’. But Mr Hunt went further and warned Britain must ‘wake up as a country on the issue of the obesity’. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged Britain to engage in 'national soul-searching' over the obesity epidemic . He told Sky News: ‘America… has an even . bigger obesity problem than us, but they have actually started to turn . the tide on obesity in the US; we haven’t started to do that here. ‘I think we’ve got to do some real national soul-searching about whether or not we’re going to grip this problem. ‘It’s not just government; the government should do more but it’s also about choices that people make over their own lifestyles.’ It comes after midwives warned the obesity epidemic is also contributing to a 'buckling' maternity service. The Royal College of Midwives said that the combination of a baby boom and staff shortages means the NHS coped with almost 130,000 more births in 2012 than the service was designed for. In means it is lacking resources to deliver one in five of the 700,000 babies born in England each year. In its annual State of Maternity Services report, the RCM says the situation is exacerbated by growing numbers of complex pregnancies. The obesity crisis is adding to the strain, with tens of thousands of women requiring more demanding care in pregnancy because of  their weight. Around half of women of child-bearing age are overweight or obese and more than 15 per cent of pregnant women are obese.","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says America has 'turned the tide' on obesity .

Britain must end its throw away culture and repair fridges, washing machines and cars instead of buying more ‘stuff’, a top government adviser has warned. Professor David MacKay said attempts to cut energy consumption and hit green targets are being hampered by the rush to buy new appliances instead of adopting a ‘make do and mend’ mentality. The chief scientific adviser to the energy department warned that the return to economic growth will make the problem even worse, because families will have more money to spend on new purchases. A quarter of all electrical appliances sent to landfill could be repaired and reused, saving £200million-a-year . A quarter of all waste electrical and electronic equipment which is sent to landfill could be reused, worth £200million a year, according to official figures. Government waste agency Wrap warns that between now and 2020 the UK will buy 100million tonnes of new electronic goods, which will include components containing 20 tonnes of gold, 400 tonnes of silver and 7 tonnes of platinum. Prof MacKay said the public must learn to keep using cars and appliances until they stop working, and then have them broken down for spare parts. He told a Department of Energy and Climate Change newsletter: ‘One difficult challenge is the way in which economic activity and growth currently is coupled to buying lots of stuff and then throwing it away. ‘When a fridge, clothes-washer, or microwave develops a fault we throw it away instead of repairing it. Car manufacturers love us to buy a new car every few years.’ Repairs: Families must go back to the days of having appliances fixed, as seen in a 1977 episode of Coronation Street when Harry Brown (Alan Hulse) was seen mending Hilda Ogden's (Jean Alexander) new washing machine. Reusing appliances and furniture could . save families £1billion-a-year while businesses could save £17 billion, . the government claims. It would also create work for repairs shops. Prof Mackay wrote the book ‘Sustainable Energy - without the hot air’ and teaches at Cambridge University. Prof David MacKay said the British public had to stop buying 'stuff' and carry out more repairs . He said people had to get used to the . idea of reusing parts from appliances instead of dumping electricals and . buying brand new replacements. ‘The whole system could use significantly less energy if we designed things to last, if we only bought things we need to use, if we used them for their full life, repairing them when necessary, and then disassembled them carefully so that components could be re-used. How can we get there from here?’ However, with British economic growth gaining momentum, persuading people not to return to spending will be difficult. New figures this week showed new car sales in Britain have hit the highest level for six years. Some 2.26million new vehicles were registered in 2013 according to official figures - a 10.8 per cent jump on 2012 and the best annual total since 2007. However, critics noted that newer cars and appliances are likely to be more energy efficient. Tory MP Peter Lilley, who sits on the Commons energy and climate change committee, told the Telegraph: ‘If we repair the inefficient ones we will consume far more energy. ‘Prof MacKay should either decide whether he’s chief scientific adviser or whether he’s going to join Friends of the Earth and knit his own socks.’","Prof David MacKay said green targets can only be met if UK stops waste .

Thomas Hitzlsperger today became the first Premier League footballer to come out as gay after recently realising he 'preferred' men. The 31-year-old German international midfielder, who ended his playing career in September due to persistent injuries, said he came out in a bid to break the taboo . of homosexuality in sport. In what as a landmark moment for football, he told Germany's Die Zeit newspaper that now was ‘a good time’ for him to reveal his sexuality. Hitzlsperger said: ‘I'm coming out about my homosexuality because I want to move the discussion about homosexuality among professional sportspeople forwards. The retired footballer said he has only realised ‘in the past few years’ that he would ‘prefer to live together with another man’, saying the issue is otherwise taboo inside the dressing room. ‘I've never been ashamed of the way I am,’ he added, although he conceded it has not always been easy to live with some of the comments dished out on the subject. ‘Just picture 20 men sat around a table together drinking - you've just got to let the majority be, just as long as the jokes are halfway funny and the talk about homosexuality doesn't get too insulting,’ he said. ‘In England, Germany or Italy, homosexuality is not taken seriously as an issue, at least not in the dressing room.’ The 31-year-old is the first high-profile German player to publicly reveal that he is homosexual. Justin Fashanu was the first professional footballer in Britain to come out in 1990 before he took his own life eight years later, aged 37. But he never played in the Premier League, which began in 1992. Hitzlsperger played 52 times for Germany between 2004 and 2010 and spent his club career at Aston Villa, VfB Stuttgart, Lazio, West Ham United, VfL Wolfsburg and Everton.

"By . Carol Davis . PUBLISHED: . 17:36 EST, 6 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:54 EST, 7 January 2014 . Dominic Ridgers aged 10. He died from carbon monoxide poisoning . The moment Stacey Rodgers stepped into her ten-year-old son Dominic's bedroom one cold morning, she knew immediately that something was terribly wrong. 'Dominic was usually up before me, keen to get to school, but that morning there wasn't a sound,' says Stacey, 36, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. The previous evening Dominic, a keen footballer with a cheeky smile, had been watching TV and playing on his PlayStation when Stacey popped her head round the door to say goodnight. He had seemed his normal self - but that morning he was lying with his face to the wall and didn't stir when she called him. 'I thought he was joking at first but I went to touch him and he felt frozen,' she recalls. With her heart hammering, Stacey called an ambulance and her mum. 'A million things were going through my head - I didn't know if he was dead or alive. The ambulance operator asked me to check for a pulse and a heartbeat, and I thought I heard one but it must have been my own heart pounding away.' Within minutes paramedics arrived. Stacey, who was 27 at the time, then received the awful news that Dominic - her only child - was dead. 'When an ambulanceman came downstairs and started to say, ""I'm sorry..."" I just said, ""I know"". We were so close - I was just devastated. 'He was my whole family, and at that point I couldn't envisage how I would carry on. You put your child to bed thinking it's the safest place in the world but that night it wasn't.' Overcome with grief, she couldn't understand why Dominic had died. The paramedics mentioned that gas could be involved and told her she couldn't return to her home. Then later that afternoon the coroner's office called to say blood tests had shown carbon monoxide in Dominic's bloodstream. Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas produced when fossil fuels, including gas, oil and solid fuels, don't burn properly  because appliances are faulty or poorly ventilated. So instead of combining with oxygen to make water vapour and carbon dioxide, the gas creates soot and carbon monoxide. Cases peak in winter when the heating is on and doors and windows are closed. It doesn't have to come from your own house to be lethal. For, as the inquest into Dominic's death heard, carbon monoxide had leaked from a faulty boiler in a neighbouring house. 'When I found out I was furious - I'd looked after my home and my son,' says Stacey. 'The neighbour had only been in the house six weeks. I couldn't talk to her much because she didn't speak good English, but she must have been devastated to find the fumes had killed Dominic while her children were fine, despite the danger. She'd put her trust in the landlord to maintain the property.' Each year, at least 4,000 people are treated in hospital for the effects of breathing in carbon monoxide and around 40 Britons die, according to the Department of Health. However, there is growing evidence that official figures for carbon monoxide deaths are too low: in France, which has a similar size population, around 100 carbon monoxide deaths are recorded each year, making it the largest cause of death by accidental poisoning. Dominic's mother Stacey, from Huddersfield . 'Forty deaths may be on the low side,' says Dr Rob Hicks, a London GP who is backing the Carbon Monoxide - Be Alarmed! campaign. 'It's possible some people's deaths are wrongly attributed to conditions such as a heart complaint. The problem is we don't routinely test for carbon monoxide during post-mortems in this country.' When carbon monoxide is breathed in, it displaces oxygen from the bloodstream. As a result, healthy tissue starts to die and the brain and heart can't function properly. If just 0.5 per cent of the air we inhale is carbon monoxide, it can be fatal within a minute or two, according to the Health Protection Agency. 'People can be exposed to different levels of carbon monoxide and respond differently, but some develop long-term problems without anyone ever determining that it was carbon monoxide that caused them,' says Dr Hicks. At lower doses it can cause long-term health complaints such as headaches or heart failure (because the lack of oxygen makes the heart work harder) - these often go unlinked to carbon monoxide. 'Prolonged exposure over time can cause coronary heart disease, angina and heart attack,' says Dr Hicks. 'It can also cause brain damage, causing confusion, memory and co-ordination problems; or it can cause problems in pregnancy, including low birth weight and stillbirth. 'If a patient complains of nausea and headaches which disappear when they leave the house, that should be a red flag - these symptoms can occur after exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide over a long period, though if you are exposed to low levels enough times it can eventually kill you.' Sometimes the symptoms may be confused with a viral infection - even by doctors. The carbon monoxide that killed Dominic was thought to have built up to a fatal level in just one evening. After he died, in 2004, Stacey threw herself into campaigning to warn other families. She now runs the Dominic Rodgers Trust, which campaigns to improve gas safety and raise awareness of carbon monoxide. Because you can't see, smell or taste carbon monoxide, the only way to tell it's there is a carbon monoxide detector. These are small sealed boxes, like a smoke alarm, that cost about £15. Experts recommend having one in every room with a heating appliance that can emit carbon monoxide, though some people also put them in bedrooms. A recent survey found that 35 million Britons don't have a carbon monoxide alarm at all.'Many people die in their sleep, which is why people should buy audible alarms that will wake them up,' says Dr Hicks. From October 1 last year, new legislation in Scotland made it compulsory to fit a carbon monoxide alarm when any new fossil-fuelled heating appliance is installed. Alarms are also a legal requirement in new homes in Northern Ireland. Although new appliances are less likely to be faulty, they can cause problems if wrongly installed. But Dr Hicks, and others, want more stringent UK-wide legislation. As well as having a carbon monoxide alarm, checking heating and cooking appliances before winter is vital, say experts. Deaths and hospital admissions peak in winter when appliances are working harder. After Dominic died, in 2004, Stacey threw herself into campaigning to warn other families . 'Appliances can emit carbon monoxide if birds have nested in a chimney and blocked it, or ivy has grown over an external flue,' says Leigh Greenham, a director of the Council for Gas Detection and Environmental Monitoring, the trade association representing gas detection companies.

The average commuter burns 324 calories a day getting to and from work - the equivalent of a jam doughnut or a chocolate bar. The Great British commute is as effective as 20 to 30 minutes on a treadmill, new research reveals. The average daily commute takes nearly 57 minutes and sees people stand for 19.24 minutes, tackle 32.2 steps and walk for 22.66 minutes. In a year commuters will burn 84,240 calories which means each person could lose 24lbs in 2014. Top for working out while commuting were those living around Cardiff who burnt off 386 calories daily, followed by those into the capital who burnt 378 calories. However, those living around Sheffield were bottom burning off just 246 calories. Research shows that even small adjustments to the morning routines can make a difference – for example, doing minor exercises like bum clenches or standing on one leg can help burn calories. Virgin Active found that 600 bum clenches can burn 50 calories, and standing on one leg while brushing your teeth can burn 80. Laughing for 15 minutes can even burn 25 calories, tone your body and improve your overall health. Hugh Hanley, from Virgin Active, said: ‘It's not always easy to invest time in getting fit which is why this research is so uplifting. It showed us that even the small things we already do are a step in the right direction. ‘The benefits that we've identified about the morning commute are surprising, so imagine the good we can do if we consciously make an effort towards an active and healthy life - things like taking the stairs, rather than the lift or clenching your bum on your commute to work can make a big difference.’ For people already making a conscious effort on their commute, the results are surprising. On average bike commuters cycle for 25.22 minutes and burn 256 calories each way, runners tend to run for 12.29 minutes burn 125 calories. Walkers spend an average of 21.56 minutes exercising and expend up to 88 calories before they have reached the office. Tube travellers in London burnt the most calories.

Hilly Sheffield meanwhile is the driving capital of the UK, with seven out of ten choosing cars for their commute, while seven per cent of commuters in Belfast cycle to work. Dietician Hasina Aktar said: ‘Just doing a few extra things like bum clenches and standing on one leg, on top of your regular commute, can expend over 500 Kcals a day. ‘This could lead to you losing one pound of body weight per week. ‘Laughing more is another great route to a healthy body and mind. Laughter burns calories, reduces muscle tension, increases amount of oxygen in the blood, exercises the heart and produces endorphins - happy hormones.’","The average commuter burns 324 calories a day getting to and from work .

"By . Peter Lloyd . PUBLISHED: . 11:47 EST, 12 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:47 EST, 12 July 2012 . A man made daytime television history by discussing penis enlargement surgery on ITV's This Morning. Interviewed by Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby in a pre-recorded segment to protect his identity, the anonymous figure revealed how he had paid £5,000 to have fat removed from his love handles and injected along the shaft of his manhood to increase its girth. Breaking new ground for pre-watershed viewing, this nine-minute feature peaked when before-and-after photos flashed up on screen; no doubt to cackles of laughter in the production office and across the country. Crusade: A man known only as 'Danny' appeared on This Morning to talk about his penoplasty (penis enlargement) operation in the hope that it would help stop what he calls society's 'toxic' attitude towards penis size . A penis? On show? Let's point and laugh. That's what they're there for. But it wasn't the difference in this man's penis size that impressed me. Far from it. Although he'd certainly got what he'd paid for courtesy of Harley Street's Dr Roberto Viel, I was more amazed that this brave chap - who actually had a perfectly good penis to start with - had coined a phrase to describe an illness that so many men suffer from: penile dysmorphia. And, given that we're now in 2012, it needs to stop. Borrowing terminology from body dysmorphia, which sees patients clinically pre-occupied with a non-existent physical fault in themselves, this ordinary bloke with his back to the camera had summed up an endemic problem with two words and given the burgeoning men's movement, as well as his body, a boost. As a fellow men's rights activist, I salute him. He hadn't undergone surgery for vanity or to out-do his mates in the changing room. Why would he? None of them care. Nor had he done it to correct a medical problem which was blighting his life (one that wouldn't have been taken seriously, even if he had). Ashamed: The man chose to remain anonymous, his identity protected by a wig, for fear of ridicule in a society he says mocks men unfairly for their penis size . Instead, he was simply trying to undo years of 'toxic messages from women and the media', which had left him psychologically scarred. The very messages which affect all males, from young boys to war veterans. It was this - not the gory footage of the operation - which brought a tear to my eye. Namely because he stood up for the basic dignity of all men, including me, the bloke next door and the latest guy being drafted to serve in the Helmand Provence. By coining the term penile dysmorphia, he has summed up an endemic problem with two words and given the burgeoning men's movement, as well as his body, a boost. Thanks to this person's willingness to speak up and not show off, men have finally been given the terminology to describe a shame they're taught to harbour from childhood. A sexism that comes regardless of what a man's penis might look like; but simply because he has one in the first place. They are always too small, too thin or just plain ugly, irrespective of how they actually are. Young boys are still told that size matters, while girls are counselled over size zero models in magazines. Women scorn the fashion industry for putting pressure on their sisters (and they're right to), but it's these very women who often trash a guy because his body isn't to their liking. Even though his body is his, not theirs. In demand: Dr Roberto Viel performs four to five penoplasty operations every week, costing £3,000 for a girth increase and £3,500 for a boost in length . Rarely is the defining part of a man's body respected for simply being the amazing, multi-functional, life-creating organ it actually is. Yet, despite such messages creating generation after generation of men and boys who suffer in silence, they are constantly regurgitated. And, although I run the risk of sounding like the male equivalent of Samantha Brick, it's women who are mostly to blame. As a man with many close female friends and many women in my immediate family - women who are often smart, successful and emotionally intelligent - I can honestly say that 90 per cent of them have offended me at some point by mocking another guy's penis. I love my sister-in-laws, but they've done it. As have the wives of my best friends. So too have celebrities I've interviewed for magazines, one of my former female bosses and, perhaps most disturbingly, clever women who have young sons, loving husbands and fathers who deserve better. I was once at a friend's 21st birthday party, which was festooned with pictures of him at various stages in his life; including some as a child in the bath. Even here, while celebrating his passage into adulthood, there were women whom I overheard say: 'Hmm, he hasn't changed much...if you know what I mean.' Another time, during a man's speech about prostate cancer at a major health seminar in London, two women in the row ahead of me leaned in to each other and made an inch gesture between their thumb and forefinger. Both times, my heart sank - not for me or my body. I'm happy. But for the brotherhood. Comparatively, I've never once heard any of the men in my life subject their girlfriends to the same humiliation and paranoia. But can we really blame women? Yes. And they need to take responsibility for their words. But it's also right to point the finger at the media. Whether it manifests in a Lily Allen album track (there are two which do this - charming, I know) or one of the countless female characters in film and TV who take great delight in belittling men over the penis - a kick in the crotch or a wiggle of their little finger - it's offensive to all men; the overwhelming majority of whom are good, good people. Likewise, if a presenter like Jeremy Clarkson rated women on the tautness of their vagina (which, FYI, varies as much as men's genitalia) like certain loose women, there would be an outrage. It would be offensive. And rightly so. But, sorry girls, it's no different when the victims are male. To make matters worse, there are virtually no positive or neutral messages about this wonderful part of the human body to counteract the above. And it has a knock-on affect for every other men's issue, from self-esteem and sexual health to male genital mutilation, otherwise known as domestic abuse. Recently, a woman was arrested in the U.S. for allegedly drugging her husband, restraining him, cutting off his penis and destroying it in a garbage disposal; all because he asked for a divorce. The response? Sharon Osbourne declared on live TV that it was 'quite fabulous'. Unsurprisingly, she kept her job, which is funny given what Andy Gray was fired for. Perhaps this wouldn't have happened if men demanded more respect for their penises. Feminist author Susie Orbach once said that fat was a feminist issue. I suspect she's right, but if she is, then penis size is an issue of the same scale for men. Thanks to the gentleman on This Morning's sofa today, my faith in U-turning this has been somewhat restored; namely because the people who judge the size of his penis might pay more attention to the size of their brains. After all, not only did he have the courage to be honest about his most private body part on national TV, he also had the balls to tackle male sexism head-on. Now that's big.

"By . Emma Thomas . PUBLISHED: . 11:09 EST, 8 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:24 EST, 8 January 2014 . A taxi firm owner says he has been forced to employ two thirds of his workforce from Eastern Europe - because British people are too lazy. Businessman Terry Spooner, 42, criticised the UK benefits culture which has led to local drivers preferring to take Government handouts instead of getting a job. He turned to employing Romanian and Bulgarian drivers 18 months ago because he said no local workers were applying for the positions. Hardworking: (left to right) Terry Spooner and Emma Spooner, with Romanian drivers Sorin Obrescu, Cristian Honciu, George Rimniceanu and Cseba Arkosi. Mr Spooner employs Eastern Europeans over British workers . Now 20 of the 34 drivers at Ultimate Taxis in Newport, Shropshire, are from Eastern European countries. And Mr Spooner believes their work ethic is 'ten times better' than local workers who have been known to regularly phone in sick or quit after a week. The taxi company boss said that he started finding employees from abroad after being persistently let down by drivers from Shropshire. Today, Mr Spooner, who has run the business with his wife Emma for the past 14 years, said: 'We’ve been taking on Romanians and Hungarians for 18 months under the Self Employed Right to Work law because there were difficulties in recruiting drivers locally. 'The difficulty in getting local staff was the reliability. 'A lot of service industries are recruiting Eastern Europeans to ensure they have staff who simply turn up. I was being let down too often. 'People would either pull sickies without letting you know or quit after a week or so. 'The benefits culture in this country certainly doesn’t help the matter. People balance it all up and they think what’s the point of going to work for an extra £150 a week, so it puts people off. And that is what is wrong with this country. Driver Csaba Arkosi , 43, has been in the UK for three years and has worked at Ultimate Taxis for a year . 'These workers come over with the sort of work-ethic we used to have 30 or 40 years ago where we didn’t mind a bit of graft and getting our hands dirty. 'Now some people weigh up whether it worth that extra bit of cash when they can quite comfortably live off benefits - and that is why this country is in a rut. 'At the end of the day it’s not about nationality, it’s about individuals - but it is true to say some cultures do have a better work ethic.' Mr Spooner says he is given the names of potential foreign workers by a third party and then either interviews the hopefuls by video link, or flies out to the country for a face-to-face meeting. Mr Spooner has run the business with his wife Emma for the past 14 years . Once they are in the UK they are screened and have to pass an advanced driving test before getting behind the wheel. He said some of his Eastern European recruits are highly qualified but come to the UK as the wages on offer are far higher than back home. Many of his employees rent houses to keep their costs down and some send money back home to support their families. He said: 'Some of the people we have taken on are highly trained. 'I’ve got one driver who speaks five languages and is a teacher, and another who is an IT consultant. 'In their countries they would earn 300 Euros a month whereas here they can earn that in a week.' Driver Csaba Arkosi ,43, has been in the UK for three years and has worked at Ultimate Taxis for a year. He said: 'I was working in customer support at a data company and was made redundant. 'I had to look for a solution as I had a big mortgage. 'The UK was the country which reached out with the solution. 'If I had to start out from scratch with a new job at home I wouldn’t have been able to afford my mortgage. 'I cannot predict how long I will be here, but I like the UK.' Last week a survey revealed more than three-quarters of British people want to see a cut in immigration. However, fewer people now than in 2011 think immigration is bad for the economy - 47 per cent in 2013 compared with 52 per cent two years previously, new findings from NatCen Social Research’s British Social Attitudes survey found. The coalition Government brought in a three-month ban on EU citizens getting out-of-work benefits ahead of work restrictions being lifted for Bulgarians and Romanians on New Year’s Day.","Businessman Terry Spooner, 42, criticised the UK benefits culture .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 18:18 EST, 5 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:16 EST, 6 January 2014 . Doctors are concerned that data harvested from patients by the Government will fall into the hands of hackers or be sold to insurers and drugs firms for use in targeting patients . Doctors are rebelling against plans to harvest personal information from the medical files of millions of patients. From spring, officials will begin building a giant database they say will help them identify poor performance such as long waiting times and late diagnosis of diseases such as cancer. They believe the information might even lead to new treatments. But there is widespread concern among MPs, academics and doctors that the data will fall into the hands of hackers or be sold to insurers and drugs firms for use in targeting patients. NHS England, which is overseeing the scheme, says privacy will be ensured because only dates of birth, postcodes and NHS numbers will be stored. But each year more than a million medical files go missing from the Health Service – many of them lost on public transport or dumped in bins. Unless patients tell their GP in person or over the phone that they do not want to be involved in the scheme, their data will be harvested automatically. Critics say the NHS is making it deliberately difficult for patients to opt out – given how hard it is to make an appointment with a doctor or even speak to them on the phone. At least two GPs are so opposed to the scheme they have removed the thousands of patients on their books from it unless they have specifically asked to be included. One of the doctors, who is based in Oxford and is remaining anonymous for fear of reprisals, said he believed the scheme breached data protection laws. Starting today, the NHS will begin dropping leaflets through the doors of all households explaining the scheme. It is not clear whether patients will have to see their GP in person or call the surgery - it will vary between practices. There is also concern most of the public will never read them because they will be lost among junk mail. David Davis, a Tory MP and former shadow home secretary, said: 'It's an enormous threat to privacy. To make patients go in and make  an appointment with their GP is  frankly disgraceful. 'The database does have huge value for the NHS but it will go wrong. Some people's information will be lost. If hackers can take on Microsoft, how long until they get to the Department of Health?' Sarah Wollaston, a Tory MP and GP who sits on the Commons Health Select Committee, said: There's no doubt that sharing records is good for patient care. But ultimately patients own their medical records and they should decide who they share them with. Tory MP and former shadow home secretary David Davis said: 'It's an enormous threat to privacy.' 'There are some people who might want to access it, not for the best reasons, for example insurance companies.' There is concern that officials will use the data to make cuts to NHS services where they aren't deemed to be needed – such as diabetes clinics in areas where the disease is less common. Campaigners say drug firms could even use the data to raise premiums for at-risk groups. Ross Anderson, who specialises in information security at Cambridge University, accused Health Service officials of deliberate deception. He said: 'The NHS takes the view that it's our information, we'll do with it what we want. There is no effort to maintain patients' privacy.' The professor said it would be very easy for researchers, drugs firms or insurers to identify patients just by knowing their postcode and date of birth alone. Ultimately, he said it could lead to highly personal information about patients' illnesses or conditions appearing on the internet or in research papers. Phil Booth, of the campaign group Med Confidential, said the scheme was cynical and irresponsible. But Dr Geraint Lewis, who is chief data officer at NHS England, said: 'The NHS has been collecting information like this from hospitals for decades but until now we've been missing information about the quality of care provided outside hospital. 'This is about upgrading our information systems to get a more complete picture of the quality of care being delivered across all parts of the NHS and social care.' Dr Martin Scurr warned the database will 'be a honeypot for hackers' Ever since the launch of the NHS in 1948, patients have been able to rely on a principle of confidentiality – they have always been assured that their medical notes  are private. But now, for the first time, we GPs are being told to pass those notes to a third party. The records will be mined for data by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, but in future that could be passed on to researchers and even drugs firms with commercial profits in mind. We are told that all personal data will be in an ‘anonymous' form. But it will include your postcode and your NHS number. Hardly very anonymous, then. You can't tell me that this is not a breach of confidentiality. If the situation was different and a GP handed over this kind of information to a third party, and the patient found out and complained, the consequences would be severe. That complaint would be taken to the General Medical Council, and the first thing it would do would be to suspend the GP pending an investigation for a breach of professional ethics. Yet apparently it's quite all right for a government body to do this. This is really important and the public need to know about it. From today NHS England – which runs the health service – begins posting leaflets through doors explaining how and why this data is being used. Leaflets are all well and good, but what will people do with those leaflets? Some will simply bin them, mistaking them for junk mail. Doubtless there will be patients who wouldn't want their data released  but simply won't know that it is happening. If you tell your GP that you want to opt out, your details will not be released. But why should the Government decide to release this private information unless you actively take steps to stop it? Surely it should be the other way round – that people should opt in. To say that this is the thin end of the wedge is an understatement. Who's to say that confidential information you give to your GP might not be used against you in terms of health insurance? As David Davis MP rightly says, it will also be a honeypot for hackers. There may be benefits that come from researchers being able to look at this data, but we have no reason to trust the Government on this. After all, it has a particularly poor reputation when it comes to dealing with IT systems, and it is perfectly possible this data could be abused – at cataclysmic cost to the patient.","From spring, officials will begin building a giant database .

Scientists have invented an edible gel that swells in the stomach and produces a feeling of fullness. The substance is believed to be difficult to digest - leaving the person feeling less hungry and so reducing their desire to snack or overeat. Discovery: Scientists have discovered a way of forming an edible gel that and produces a feeling of fullness . The researchers at the University of Birmingham made the discovery while combining various food ingredients, according to The Sunday Telegraph. The ingredients - derived from seaweed, starch and citrus peel - form water soluble gums that can be utilized as normal food thickeners. They are frequently used in molecular gastronomy by acclaimed British chefs, such as Heston Blumenthal. However, when exposed to stomach . acid, the ingredients start to swell and combine together to form a solid gel, according to the research published in the journal Food Hydrocolloids. Benefits: The substance is believed to leave a person feeling less hungry and so reduces their desire to snack . Scientists are now hoping to develop the substance so it can be incorporated into everyday foods. Project leader Jennifer Bradbeer said the discovery could help tackle Britain's obesity crisis - with a staggering 64 per cent of UK adults now classed as obese or overweight. 'One way of tackling the high and rising levels of . morbid obesity in today’s society is to control the consumer’s energy . intake from foods,' she told the newspaper. 'One problem is that foods have become softer, more easily digestible and therefore less satiating. 'This leads to the individual feeling hungry more quickly and subsequently wanting to eat again, often between meals.' She said that the gel - made of hydrocolloids that respond to the stomach's highly acidic conditions - could be one means of curbing a person's cravings for snacks. However, she added that while the gel alone could provide 'prolonged satiety', it would result in 'unpleasant sensations' if lacking the energy provided by food. More than 1.4billion people across the world are now classed as obese or overweight, according to a recent study by the Overseas Development Institute. People who are classed in these categories are at greater risk of heart attacks, strokes, cancers, diabetes and other health-related issues.","Solid gel swells in the stomach and produces a feeling of fullness .

A mother whose son has permanent brain damage after doctors left her in labour for ten hours without noticing her baby was in danger, looks set to get a substantial payout after doctors admitted a string of errors. Lisa Mainds was seen by six different consultants and midwives when she went into labour at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, but not one of them noticed her son was in distress. By the time Findley, now three, was born his brain had been starved of oxygen for hours, leaving him with severe brain damage. Devastated: Lisa and Stuart Mainds said they are 'heartbroken' after their son Findley was starved of oxygen at birth leaving him brain damaged . Life-changing: Mrs Mainds said her family's life has been turned upside down. She has been forced to give up work to become his full-time carer . He has since been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, needs help to walk, . talk, sit up and drink and also suffers chronic kidney disease. Findley was born by emergency C-section when doctors finally noticed he was in danger. Mrs Mainds, from Chesham in Buckinghamshire, told MailOnline: 'We are heartbroken. There were so many opportunities to spot the problem. 'We saw at least six different midwives and consultants but nobody saw the warning signs. 'They were just cruising around like they had all day. 'There was no urgency at all. By the time they noticed he was in distress it was too late. 'Having your first baby is supposed to be the happiest time of your life but I ended up crying my eyes out for weeks. Delay: When Mrs Mainds was admitted to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in August 2010, she and husband Stuart, right, had no reason to fear anything would go wrong. But medics failed to spot her unborn son's distress, waiting 10 hours before rushing her to theatre for a C-section . Brain damage: When Findley was born he was rushed to a specialist baby care unit at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford. There doctors revealed he had suffered severe brain damage. He was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy and chronic kidney disease . 'I am so, so angry. This didn't have to happen to my little boy. I can't ever forgive them for what they have done, even after the apology. They played God with my little boy's life. 'All the compensation money in the world means nothing to me, I'd do anything to turn back the clock. 'I feel as though Findley has missed out on a normal childhood. 'My son’s freedom in the future has been taken away from him because of this injury and mistakes. Smiling through adversity: Mrs Mainds said her son, now three, is 'brave and smiley' despite all he faces . 'He . is now at an age when we can really see the contrast with other . children and it is very upsetting when I see they way they interact with . their parents in a way Findley and I can't.' When the 33-year-old was admitted to the hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire at 11.20am on August 19, 2010, she had no reason to believe anything would go wrong. She was given a cardiotocograph (CTG), which measures the baby's heartbeat and the mother's contractions. Medics told Mrs Mainds the results of the test were normal, indicating there was nothing to worry about. But she and her mechanic husband Stuart, 40, had been given the wrong information, and since learned the test should have been flagged up as abnormal. Three subsequent CTGs, revealed Findley's conditions was getting worse, but no one picked up on his distress. Independent experts have said Findley should have been delivered no later than 2pm. But it was 11.25pm before medics detected something was wrong and took the 32-year-old to theatre to deliver her son. Findley was born at 12.27am on August 20, 2010 and rushed straight to a specialist intensive care unit at the John Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford. There doctors diagnosed him with grade three Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) and permanent damage to both his kidneys. Grade three HIE or global HIE, is the . second most severe grading of brain damage, and means oxygen is . prevented from reaching the brain after the blood flow is blocked. The . condition can result in a person suffering a stroke or heart attack. Admitted liability: Buckinghamshire NHS Trust, which runs Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, pictured, have admitted liability for Findley's brain damage and cerebral palsy. They have apologised to the family and paid a six-figure interim payment to help pay for his care . Mrs Mainds, who gave up her job working in an office to become her son's full-time carer, said Findley has to take 13 different types of medication on a daily basis and needs round-the-clock care. She said had she known something was wrong she would have insisted doctors delivered her son earlier. 'Findley is so brave, and he's a smiley, happy little boy,' she said. 'It is just heartbreaking knowing everything he has gone through and will go through could have been avoided. 'I want Findley to have a normal life. I want us to be a normal family and not have to worry about having these constant medical appointments and additional worries but realistically this will not ever happen now.' In October 2012, two years after Mr and Mrs Mainds took legal action, Buckinghamshire NHS Trust admitted that Findley's injuries would have been avoided if Mrs Mainds had received the correct standard of care during labour. A spokesman for the trust told MailOnline: 'Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust is sincerely sorry for the shortcomings in the obstetric treatment that Mrs Mainds received and we have written to the family to apologise. 'The Trust has admitted liability for Findley’s brain damage, including his cerebral palsy.' The hospital has paid a six-figure interim payment to the family and full compensation will be paid at a later date to fund the life-long treatment and care Findley will require. The hospital has not admitted liability for Findley's chronic kidney disease, which could result in the youngster requiring a transplant. Iona Meeres-Young, Clinical Negligence Lawyer at Slater & Gordon, said: 'Within the context of labour – 10 hours is a significant timeframe in which the Trust had numerous opportunities to intervene. 'Findley now faces catastrophic injuries which were all entirely avoidable. 'Findley is still very young, but it is a relief to the family that the defendants have admitted liability – parties can now concentrate on assessing Findley’s disabilities and ensuring he has appropriate compensation to meet his needs. 'Lisa and Stuart have dedicated their entire lives to Findley who will require lifelong care and support.'","Findley Mainds was born in August 2010 at Stoke Mandeville Hospital .

A global ‘explosion’ means that 1.46 billion adults across the globe are obese or overweight - meaning they have body mass indexes greater than 25. In the UK, 64 per cent of adults are classed in this category and are at greater risk of heart attacks, strokes, cancers, diabetes and other health-related issues. A third of adults - 1.46 billion - across the world are now classed as overweight or obese . In the developing world, the number of obese and overweight adults has quadrupled from 250 million in 1980 to 904 million in 2008. By contrast, the number of people who . were overweight or obese in high-income countries increased by 1.7 times . over the same period. The research was conducted by the Overseas Development Institute, which also warned of the associated health risks of the trend. It suggested that changing diets and over-consumption of food linked to increased prosperity in the developing world was largely behind the change. As incomes increase, diets are shifting from cereals and grains to a greater consumption of meats, fats and sugars. The ODI's Future Diets report found that the percentage of adults who were overweight or obese globally grew from 23 per cent to 34 per cent between 1980 and 2008. At the same time, under-nourishment is still a problem for hundreds of millions of people. Based on World Health Organisation statistics, this graph shows the proportion and percentage of adults across the world classified as obese or overweight, categorised by income . The overweight are at risk of heart attacks, strokes, cancers, diabetes and other health-related issues . 'The over-consumption of food, coupled with lives that are increasingly sedentary, is producing large numbers of people who are overweight and obese - primarily in high-income countries, but also in emerging middle-income countries,' the report said. 'Indeed, the world has seen an explosion in overweight and obesity in the past 30 years.' The ODI examined changing overweight and obesity rates across world regions and by individual country using data published in Population Health Metrics last year, the BBC said. This revealed that North Africa, the Middle East and Latin America saw overweight and obesity rates increase to a level similar to Europe, around 58 per cent. At 70 per cent, North America still has the highest percentage of overweight adults, but regions such as Australasia and southern Latin America are catching up, with 63 per cent. Report author Dr Steve Wiggins said that those with higher incomes had greater ability to choose the foods they want, the BBC said, while changes in lifestyle, increased availability of processed foods and influences such as advertising and media have led to dietary changes, particularly in emerging economies. With data from Stevens et al., 2012, this graph shows the proportion of adults overweight in 1980 and 2008 . This graphic, based on figures from Stevens et al, 2012, shows the changing proportion of obese adults in the developing world (dark orange) compared with the high income world (pale) in millions . The report said: 'The evidence is well-established: obesity, together with excessive consumption of fat and salt, is linked to the rising global incidence of non-communicable diseases including some cancers, diabetes, heart disease and strokes. 'What has changed is that the majority of people who are overweight or obese today can be found in the developing, rather than the developed, world.' The ODI said there was 'little will' among the public and leaders to take action to influence future diets, 'but that may change in the face of serious health implications'. And it highlighted the 'paradox of public policy', saying: 'In general, there is little appetite amongst politicians or the public in high-income countries to take strong measures to influence future diets. 'Politicians are fearful of meddling with diets, and alienating farming and food-industry interests. It seems that this reflects public opinion, with many people seeing food choices as a matter of personal freedom. 'Most people hate to see regulation of the access to favoured foods, see taxation of unhealthy foods and ingredients as onerous and unfair, and acquiesce only in response to public information and education. 'Couple this with lobbying from food industries, and the political will to affect diets withers.' The report gave the example of South Korea as having made concerted efforts to preserve healthy elements of the country's traditional diet, via public campaigns and education, providing large-scale training for women in preparing healthy, traditional food.","Those with body mass index of 25-plus are classed as obese or overweight .

A teenager is back at home with a new heart just two months after doctors gave her a five per cent chance of survival. Emily Linaker, 14, had been on the waiting list for a heart transplant for several months, but the operation became urgent after her heart deteriorated so suddenly it left her on the brink of death. Her mother, Sam, said they now feel like ‘the luckiest family on the planet’ after a donor heart became available just in time to save her. Emily Linaker, 14, had restrictive cardiomyopathy - a condition which prevented her heart filling up properly meaning her blood flow was restricted. She was diagnosed a year ago after her legs swelled up . Emily, from Blackburn, in Lancashire, was diagnosed with restrictive cardiomyopathy – a condition which reduces the heart’s ability to fill up, reducing the blood flow – at the beginning of 2013 after her legs swelled up. Doctors became concerned in November when she began vomiting heavily. She was taken to the specialist Freeman Hospital in Newcastle. Emily’s blood pressure and heart rate dropped dangerously low and she was admitted to intensive care and put on an ECMO machine - a device that does the work of the heart and lungs. As a complication of the machine being fitted, she suffered severe internal bleeding and doctors feared she would not recover. Mrs Linaker, 47, said: ‘She was very, very poorly for about three days and it was touch and go whether she’d make it. ‘She was bleeding so heavily that when they opened her chest there were three litres of blood washing around in her lungs. Emily (pictured with her parents, Kevin and Sam) was put on the heart transplant waiting list when her condition suddenly deteriorated and she had to be put on life-support in intensive care . ‘They only gave her a five per cent chance of survival and talked to us about preparing for the worst. ‘It was such a hard thing to hear and I can’t even begin to describe how it felt. I was so scared, it was unreal. ‘But gradually the bleeding stopped and they managed to stabilise her and clean up the blood.’ Before the transplant Emily, who is on crutches because of damage to the nerves in her leg, was given just a five per cent chance of survival and her parents were told to prepare for the worst . Emily was moved up the transplant . waiting list as her condition deteriorated and she was incredibly lucky . to learn a heart had become available just after she recovered from the . internal bleeding. Mrs . Linaker, who is married to drainage engineer Kevin, said: ‘It was . perfect timing because, had it turned up a couple of days earlier, she . would have been too poorly to accept it. ‘There were eight children on the priority list but it was an adult heart and she was the biggest. We feel like the luckiest people on the planet that it came up at that time.’ The transplant went ahead on November 13 and there were no complications, but Emily had to stay in hospital for another five weeks, returning home just in time for Christmas. She has since suffered some seizures and nerve damage to her leg from her time in intensive care means she will be on crutches for a few weeks, but these are not major concerns and there have been no problems with the heart. Her family has been told the donor was a lady in her 30s who died of a brain tumour. For the next three months Emily will have to take 40 tablets each day, and will need weekly check-ups in Newcastle, but she hopes to return to school in April. She said: ‘I feel tonnes better already and I’m glad to be at home. I can finally go upstairs without having to stop. I didn’t really experience a lot of what happened in hospital and when I woke up it felt like I’d been asleep for ages and ages.’ Her mother, who works as a nurse educator, added: ‘The staff at Newcastle were absolutely wonderful. I genuinely couldn’t fault any of them and we can’t thank them enough. Emily (pictured with her parents, Kevin and Sam, and her brother, Jonathan) spent five weeks in hospital after the transplant in November and is now recovering at home. She hopes to return to school in April . ‘What they did was incredible, and we are also so grateful to the donor for being so thoughtful and generous to sign up to the register and give Emily a chance of life. ‘When we left there were still people with young children who had been there when we arrived and were still waiting for an organ. It was really heart-breaking to hear their stories, so we need as many people as possible to sign up to the donation register.’ Julie Flett, children’s transplant liaison sister at the Freeman Hospital, said: ‘We are delighted that Emily is doing so well following her heart transplant. ‘She has been incredibly brave and is a great credit to her family. Our thoughts are also with the donor family especially at this time of year.’ Restrictive cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle changes or weakens so it is no longer able to fill or pump properly. The condition prevents the heart pumping blood as strongly as normal. The most common cause of the condition is scarring to the heart from an unknown cause. It can also be caused by heart disease, tumours and scarring after chemotherapy. Symptoms include having a cough, having difficulty breathing, fatigue, loss of appetite, swelling of the abdomen and swelling of the feet. There are few available treatments and if the condition is severe enough, a heart transplant may be required. People with restrictive cardiomyopathy often go on to develop heart failure.

A baby girl has undergone a life-saving procedure while still partially inside her mother's womb. Doctors feared a rare condition meant Sienna Smith would not be able to breathe when she was born, so conducted the emergency procedure before her birth. A team of 20 medics were involved in the two-hour operation. Sienna Smith (pictured with her parents, Sarah-Jane Harrup and Deryck Smith) had to have a life-saving procedure before she was born because a swelling on her neck could have prevented her breathing . First, they performed a Caesarean . section and then inserted a breathing tube before the umbilical cord was . cut and Sienna was fully removed from the womb. Her parents, Sarah-Jane Harrup and Deryck Smith from Leicestershire, were warned their baby might not survive. Planning for the operation began after a swelling was spotted on Sienna's neck at a 20-week scan. It was pressing on her windpipe and doctors knew if the swelling was a tumour it could prevent Sienna breathing when she was born. The operation was conducted by ear, nose and throat surgeon Javed Uddin who had never attempted it before. Dr Uddin said: ‘If she was born naturally, there was a high chance she would not be able to breathe and we would not be able to help her. Surgeons carried out a Caesarean section, but before Sienna was fully removed from the womb, they inserted a tube to allow her to breathe when the umbilical cord was cut . After Sienna's birth, the swelling in her neck subsided, allowing her to breathe normally . ‘We knew something in her neck was pressing on her windpipe and we needed to plan her delivery very carefully.’ Mr Uddin and his colleagues decided Sienna's best chance was to have an Exit - ex utero intrapartum - procedure to insert a breathing tube while she was still connected to the umbilical cord. They wanted to leave Sienna in the womb for as long as possible, but not so long she might be born naturally. As a result, they decided to go ahead with the operation at 37 weeks. After opening Ms Harrup’s stomach, they lifted Sienna's head so a tube could be inserted into her throat. It was vital to keep her attached to the umbilical cord to maintain her oxygen supply. Doctors feared Sienna's neck swelling might be caused by a tumour, but further tests after her birth revealed the cause to be related to a thyroid problem . Mr Uddin said: ‘It is a very rare condition and we prepared for every eventuality, including her not surviving. ‘In the past, babies with conditions such as this would have died, but due to advances in technology we can spot problems early.’ As soon as the tube was inserted, the swelling which had been compressing Sienna's windpipe subsided, allowing her to breathe normally. Mr Uddin, who performed the operation, said: 'The best thing was seeing Sienna in her mum's arms after the operation' On further investigation, the swelling turned out not to be a tumour but a goitre, an abnormal swelling of the thyroid gland. Mr Uddin said: ‘I'm really pleased to have completed the first operation of its kind here. ‘The best thing was seeing the baby in her mum's arms after the operation.’ Sienna was born on April 16, weighing 5lb 6oz. Ms Harrup, 30, said: ‘We are so grateful to Mr Uddin. ‘We cannot thank everyone enough for our beautiful daughter. ‘At first, Deryck and I were told if the lump was affecting Sienna's airways there would be nothing they could do if they couldn't get a tube in to let her breathe when she was born. Then we would have to let her go. I was so scared. ‘The operation had never been done before and we and the doctors just did not know what they would find. ‘Sienna has to take medication but she has reached all her milestones and is doing everything she should. ‘She is trying to crawl and loves doing actions to songs as well as playing with her toys.’","Sienna Smith was found to have a swelling on her neck during a scan .

Children are likely to have stronger muscles if their mothers had a higher level of vitamin D in their body during pregnancy . Mothers-to-be with high levels of vitamin D have stronger children, scientists have found. In . a study of almost 700 English mothers and their children, they found . that the more of the so-called sunshine vitamin a woman had in her blood . during pregnancy, the stronger her child’s grip at the age of four. It is thought that vitamin D has an effect on the way muscle fibres grow in the womb, helping them to work harder in later life. Young . people with strong muscles have been shown to be less susceptible to . debilitating falls and fractures in old age, and have more protection . against diabetes. Nicholas Harvey, of Southampton University, said the . research published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and . Metabolism added to evidence that showed the seeds for the diseases that . plague the elderly are sown early in life. Although . vitamin D is found in oily fish and other foods, it is mostly created . by our bodies when our skin is exposed to sunlight. The . British climate means many people struggle to make enough of it, and . pregnant women are advised to take daily supplements. But around a third . of white women and up to 90 per cent of black and Asian women in . England have low levels during pregnancy. Dr . Harvey and fellow researcher Dr Rebecca Moon used data from a . long-running health study in Southampton to compare the vitamin D levels . of pregnant women with how tightly their children could squeeze a . pressure sensor at the age of four. British researchers found that by the age of four, children whose mothers took vitamin D during their pregnancy had stronger grips and greater muscle mass . All pregnant and breastfeeding women are advised to take a daily vitamin D supplement of 10 micrograms. Vitamin D regulates the amount of calcium in the body, which helps to keep bones and teeth strong and healthy, as well as providing a baby with enough vitamin D in their first months. All pregnant and breastfeeding women, particularly teenagers and young women, are at risk of vitamin D deficiency. The people most at risk are those who spend long periods inside without much sunlight and people of South Asian or Caribbean descent as darker skin foes not produce as much vitamin D in response to sunlight. Source: NHS Start4Life . They . said increased strength at four was likely to have positive . consequences decades later because strong children tend to grow into . strong adults. The importance of vitamin D in pregnancy is underlined by . another study that found children born to women with low levels had . weaker bones as adults. Muscles also play a role in regulating hormones, . so less muscle raises the risk of diabetes. Vitamin D is known to be essential to bone health and the Government advises mothers-to-be to take ten micrograms a day. The . research is one of a growing number of studies to credit vitamin D with . benefits beyond boosting bone health. These include helping to ward off .

Archaeologists have found an ancient Mayan city that remained hidden for centuries in the rain forests of eastern Mexico; a discovery in a remote nature reserve they hope will yield clues about how the civilization collapsed around 1,000 years ago. The team, led by Ivan Sprajc, associate professor at the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, found 15 pyramids - including one that stands 75 feet tall - ball courts, plazas and tall, sculpted stone shafts called stelae. They named the city Chactun, meaning 'Red Rock' or 'Large Rock'. Scroll down for video . A National Institute of Anthropology and History worker shows the remains of a building at the newly discovered ancient Maya city Chactun in Yucatan peninsula . The Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts recently discovered lost Maya artifacts . Archaeologists named the city Chactun, meaning 'Red Rock' or 'Large Rock' Chactun likely had its heyday during the late Classic period of Maya civilization between 600 and 900 A.D. Sprajc said it was likely slightly less populous than the large ancient Maya city of Tikal in Guatemala, and could have been home to as many as 30,000 or 40,000 people, though further research is necessary to determine an exact estimate. Chactun likely had its heyday during the late Classic period of Maya civilization between 600 and 900 A.D., Sprajc said. The team's research was approved by the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History and funded by the National Geographic Society and two European companies. Sprajc said the site — which covers 22 hectares (54 acres) and lies 75 miles due west of Chetumal — is one of the largest found in the Yucatan's central lowlands. The nearest settlement to the ruins is the small town of Xpujil, around 16 miles away. 'The whole site is covered by the jungle,' he said in Spanish. While the site was unknown to the academic community, Sprajc found evidence that other people had been to the site as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, but not since. 'Lumberjacks and gum extractors were certainly already there, because we saw cuts on the trees,' Sprajc said. 'What happened is they never told anyone.' Academics say the lost city was abandoned around the year 1,000, probably due to demographic pressure, climate change, wars and rebellions . Researchers found evidence that other people had been to the site as recently as 20 or 30 years ago . The site covers 22 hectares (54 acres) and lies 75 miles due west of Chetumal . While reviewing aerial photographs taken by the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity 15 years ago to monitor the nature reserve, Sprajc and his team saw suggestions of ruins and marked the coordinates. They then spent three weeks clearing a 10-mile (16-km) path through the jungle to reach the site. After mapping the site for six weeks and documenting the monuments, they blocked the path before leaving to prevent access. The presence of multiple ball game courts is an indication that Chactun was a very important city, Sprajc said. It was likely abandoned around the year 1,000, probably due to demographic pressure, climate change, wars and rebellions. Traditional mask at Quintana Roo, Yucatan in Mexico .

Tikal, which was first mapped by archaeologists in the late 19th century, had a population estimated at up to 90,000. In December, thousands of people traveled to the Yucatan to celebrate a new cycle in the Maya calendar amidst fears that the Maya had actually predicted that December 21 would mark the end of the world.","Archaeologists have found an ancient Mayan city they named Chactun - meaning 'Red Rock' or 'Large Rock'

A medicine stockpiled by the Department of Health to hand out to millions of Britons during a flu pandemic may not even work, MPs warn. Some £424million has been spent on supplies of Tamiflu since 2006, yet there is no clear evidence available that it is effective. A flu pandemic, which relates to an epidemic crossing a large geographical area, is considered by the Government to be a far deadlier risk to Britons than a terrorism attack or weather catastrophe. However, we may have little protection against it. Stockpiled: A box a Tamiflu and loose capsules of the drug. But ministers have been warned the drug may not work . A report by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee accuses NHS watchdogs of not demanding enough evidence from drugs firms on the safety of their products before allowing them to be used by British patients. NICE decides which drugs are used on the NHS and the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approves them for public and private use. The MPs' report accuses both of just 'taking manufacturers' word for it' that drugs work. If that is the case, millions of patients could be taking medicines which are ineffective and may have potentially dangerous side-effects. Tory MP Richard Bacon, who sits on the Public Accounts Committee, said: 'The full results of clinical trials are being routinely and legally withheld from doctors and researchers by the manufacturers of medicines. 'This has ramifications for the whole of medicine. The ability of doctors, researchers and patients to make informed decisions about treatments is being undermined. This is of extreme concern to this committee. 'There is still a lack of consensus over how well the antiviral medicine Tamiflu, stockpiled for use in an influenza pandemic, actually works.' Tamiflu is made by Swiss firm Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland . The Department of Health bought Tamiflu from Swiss drugs manufacturer Roche. It was widely distributed among GPs and private companies during the 2009/10 swine flu scare but very little was used because the pandemic never materialised. Officials calculated that the drug would reduce the likelihood of death and complications such as pneumonia by up to 50 per cent but the new report warns that this was based on 'judgment' rather than 'evidence'. The report says that the MHRA only looked at a handful of trials on Tamiflu, nearly all which were actually funded by its manufacturer, Roche. And in 2010, the Government had to throw away £74million worth of the drug which had been distributed across the country because health officials had forgotten to tell people how to correctly store it. Tamiflu is meant to be kept at temperatures below 77F (25C) but the Department of Health did not include this guidance with the supplies. When the stock was sent back to Whitehall after the scare had passed, officials were forced to dispose of it in case it was no longer effective. The MPs also warn that only half of clinical trials are ever published and positive results which show drugs to be effective are twice as likely to be made public than negative ones. Richard Stephens, a cancer patient who has taken part in five clinical trials, said: 'Patients have a right to know that the medicines they are being given are the best available. 'How can we have informed choice if somebody is keeping back the information we need to make the choice? 'Patients participate in clinical trials because we expect the information to be of use to other patients. It is downright immoral to keep recruiting sick people to them if you aren't going to make all the results known.'","Some £424m has been spent on supplies of Tamiflu since 2006 .

A naturally occurring hormone can be used to stop the ‘high’ produced by cannabis, research has shown. The discovery could lead to new approaches to treating cannabis intoxication and dependence. It may also assist in the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes while blocking its psychoactive effects. A naturally occurring hormone called pregnenolone  can be used to stop the 'high' produced by cannabis and the discovery could lead to new approaches to treating cannabis intoxication and dependence, according to new research . Pregnenolone is a hormone that is found in our bodies and can be made in the lab. the chemical is used for fatigue and increasing energy, Alzheimer’s disease and enhancing memory, trauma and injuries, as well as stress and improving immunity. It is also is used for skin disorders including psoriasis. In the body, pregnenolone is used to make all steroid hormones. Because of this, it was studied studied for stress, fatigue, and arthritis in the 1940s before lab-made hormones became available. Source: WebMD . Researchers found that the steroid . hormone pregnenolone reduces the brain's sensitivity to THC, which is . the chief high-inducing compound in cannabis. Scientists led by Dr Monique Vallee, from the University of Bordeaux in France, studied mice and rats to see how recreational drugs such as cocaine, alcohol and cannabis affected the production of steroids in the brain involved in nerve function. They found that THC triggered a dramatic spike in pregnenolone through activation of the cannabinoid receptor (CB-1) - a molecule that facilitates cannabis stimulation. This in turn had a ‘negative feedback’ effect leading to a blunting of THC activity, reducing the ‘high’ from the drug. ‘This new understanding of the role of pregnenolone has the potential to generate new therapies for the treatment of cannabis dependence,’ the scientists said. The findings, published in the journal Science, follow the decision to legalise the recreational use of cannabis in the U.S. state of Colorado. Yesterday saw the legalisation of recreational sales of marijuana in Colorado, where customers queued to buy an ounce (28.3g) of legal cannabis. Researchers found that the steroid hormone pregnenolone reduces the brain's sensitivity to THC, which is the chief high-inducing compound in cannabis . Possession, cultivation and private consumption of marijuana has been legal in the state since November 2012 but the sale of the drug from shops marks a turning point. Colorado has set up a plant-tracking system in a bid to prevent the drug from entering the black market, and regulators have set up packaging, labelling and testing requirements. In December, Uruguay became the first country to to make it legal to grow, sell and consume marijuana. The law allowing registered Uruguayans over 18 to buy up to 40g (1,4oz) of the drug a month is expected to come into force in April and the government hopes it will weaken tackle drug cartels. A recent study found teenagers who use cannabis regularly risk damaging their memory as structures in their brains appeared to shrink and collapse inward, possibly reflecting a decrease in neurons . However, while some people believe the legalisation of the drug will cut criminal activity surrounding it, others believe it will expose more people to drugs, which have been linked to health issues. A recent study found teenagers who use cannabis regularly risk damaging their memory, which can lead to poor academic performance. They believe the brain abnormalities last for ‘at least a few years’ after users have stopped taking the drug. The researchers also said there was fresh evidence the habit may cause mental health problems in youngsters predisposed to schizophrenia. Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug among adolescents in the UK, with more than four in ten admitting having taken it. Almost 100 teenagers took part in the U.S. research examining the effects of cannabis deep in the brain. It found teenagers who smoked it daily for about three years had abnormal changes in the brain structures related to remembering and processing information and they performed poorly on memory tasks. The brain abnormalities and memory problems were found on MRI scans when study participants were in their early twenties – two years after they had stopped smoking the drug. Memory-related structures in their brains appeared to shrink and collapse inward and the researchers from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, said such damage was linked to poor academic performance and everyday functioning.","University of Bordeaux researchers found the hormone pregnenolone cuts the brain's sensitivity to THC - the high-inducing compound in cannabis .

A trip to the optician saved a little boy's life after an eye test revealed cancer in both his eyes. Will and Georgina Plant took their son, Benjamin, for an appointment after noticing a 'cat's eye' reflection in his pupils. The optician was so concerned she immediately phoned the local hospital to refer the one-year-old to a specialist, who later diagnosed retinoblastoma in both his eyes. Luckily the tumours were spotted early enough and Benjamin is expected to survive and retain his vision. Benjamin Plant was diagnosed with retinoblastoma after his parents, Will and Georgina, took him to the optician with a 'cat's eye' reflection in his eyes . Praising the optician who spotted the symptoms, Mrs Plant said: 'If it hadn't been for her speed of action we might not be in the same position now. 'The main message I would like to give to other parents is, if you have any concerns at all, go and get your child checked out.' Mrs and Mrs Plant, of Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, first noticed the reflection in their son's eyes last spring. Unbeknown to them, it is a classic sign of retinoblastoma - a fast-growing form of cancer which develops in the cells of the retina. They took Benjamin to the local branch of Haine and Smith in their town and were immediately referred to hospital, despite it being the May Bank Holiday weekend. Mr Plant said: 'I asked my optometrist at Haine and Smith to look at Benjamin's right eye because we were concerned about an odd, cats eye reflection that we had noticed intermittently and under very specific lighting conditions and angles. The tell-tale signs of retinoblastoma most commonly include a white reflection in the pupil often noticed in photographs or dim lighting (file picture - left eye is affected) 'On seeing something extremely serious that needed immediate investigation, the optometrist stayed on late to prepare a referral letter, and even phoned the hospital on the Sunday to ensure Benjamin was seen by the ophthalmologist as soon as possible.' An examination at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon revealed a loss of sight in Benjamin's right eye that his parents had previously been unaware of. After an examination under anaesthetic the family were referred to a specialist retinoblastoma clinic at the Royal London Hospital. Retinoblastomas are graded based on their position and size, with a grade A being the least and E the most dangerous. The optician was so worried about Benjamin that he was immediately referred to Great Western Hospital, in Swindon. He was found to have cancer in both his eyes and has had to have six cycles of chemotherapy . Doctors graded Benjamin's right eye at D and the tumour in his left eye as an A because it had been caught early. He has undergone a six-cycle course of chemotherapy and been given a greater than 99 per cent chance of survival. Doctors expect the vision to be saved in his left eye and say there is a 50/50 chance of saving his right eye and any remaining vision. He has now completed his chemotherapy but is continuing to go to London every four to six weeks for monitoring and further treatment. Benjamin has now been given a 99 per cent chance of survival and doctors hope to save most of his sight. File image shows the iris of an eye with retinoblastoma . Mr Plant added: 'Benjamin has coped well with all the trips to and from hospital and despite his illness is a lively, happy boy.' Retinoblastoma develops in the cells of the retina - the light-sensitive lining of the eye - and generally affects children before the age of five. The tell-tale signs most commonly include a white reflection in the pupil often noticed in photographs or dim lighting. Children may also have a new squint, a change of colour to the iris or a red, sore or swollen eye without infection. Retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer that usually affects children under the age of five. As it is usually caught early in the UK, 98 per cent of children with the disease are successfully treated. About 50 children develop the cancer every year in the UK. Retinoblastoma is a cancer of the retina - the light-sensitive lining at the back of the eye. It can affect one or both eyes. In about 40 per cent of cases it is caused by a faulty gene - this can be inherited from the parents or may randomly develop. Small tumours can usually be treated with laser treatment or freezing treatment. Larger tumours require chemotherapy or surgery. The most common symptoms are the pupil looking like a cat's eye, and the child developing a squint. The cat's eye look is most commonly seen in photos.

A bout of shingles puts you at higher risk of having a stroke or heart attack years later, a study shows. For people under 40, an attack of the viral infection led to the risk of stroke rising by 74 per cent and a heart attack by 50 per cent. Older people were less affected, but shingles increased their risk of a heart attack by 10 per cent and of a ‘mini-stroke’ or transient ischaemic attack by 15 per cent. A bout of shingles puts you at higher risk of having a stroke or heart attack years later, a study shows . Shingles is caused by reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox. According to the NHS, it is estimated that 189,000 adults get shingles in the UK every year. After a case of chickenpox, the virus stays dormant in the body but can flare up into shingles in people with a weakened immune system due to age, stress or poor health. Symptoms include nerve pain and a blistering skin rash. The researchers suggest that reactivation of the virus can spread to the arteries, which pushes up the risk of cardiovascular disease. The link between shingles and heart problems was found by British researchers, who studied 106,000 shingles sufferers and 213,200 people of a similar age who did not have shingles. Records from a GP database were reviewed for an average of six years after diagnosis, up to 24 years. The study, published in the online issue of the journal Neurology, took into account traditional risk factors such as obesity, smoking and high cholesterol. Study author Dr Judith Breuer, from University College London, said: ‘Anyone with shingles, and especially younger people, should be screened for stroke risk factors.’ Shingles . is caused by the same virus as chickenpox, the herpes varicella-zoster . virus, and causes a painful rash which develops into itchy blisters. It . is an infection of a nerve and the skin around it which can also make . people feel unwell for several days before any rash appears. Most . people carry the virus dormant after suffering from chickenpox as a . child, but it can be reactivated in later life to cause shingles. There . is currently no cure for the disease and in most cases the painful rash . lasts between 7 and 10 days, although it can take two to four weeks to . fully heal. The disease . can also lead to complications such as postherpetic neuralgia, which is . when severe nerve pain lasts for more than three months after the rash . has gone. Estimations suggest this affects at least 1 in 10 people with shingles, although it is more common in older people.","According to NHS - 189,000 adults get shingles in the UK every year .

The Kitchen Safe is a plastic container with a lid that locks into place for a set length of time, depending on the desired setting. The plastic box will only open when the countdown has ended . A chocolate-mad designer from San Francisco has invented a clever contraption to stop weak-willed dieters dipping into the biscuits and crisps. The Kitchen Safe is a plastic container . with a lid that locks into place using small prongs. The lid stays locked for a set length . of time - from one minute up to 10 days  - and can't be opened until the timer runs down. It was designed by 39-year-old David Krippendorf. Krippendorf said he would often ask his wife Jenny to hide junk food in the house so he could try and stick to a healthy diet and resist  temptation. But he was unable to ignore his sweet tooth and always found himself hunting down the sugary snacks and binge eating. Eventually the 39-year-old came up with an innovative idea that would keep his favourite treats locked away until after dinner. To curb his cravings David places cookies, chocolates, sweets or crisps into the box and enters the desired time setting. The plastic box will then only open when the countdown has ended - even removing the batteries won't release the lid. The only other way to get into the box is to physically smash it, added Krippendorf, although users are given a five-second window to correct the timer if they make a mistake. The Kitchen Safe is currently being listed on Kickstarter, a website where members of the public can donate money to new products and ideas to get them manufactured. If it reaches the £19,400 target, Krippendorf plans to ship it by September for £18. Use the safe for things which might distract you from something. Locking up your iPhone will eliminate the distraction, and putting video games controllers out of reach will encourage children to do their homework . They've thought of everything: The Kitchen Safe, left, cannot be opened before a set time without actually breaking it. However, if you set the timer wrong you get five seconds to cancel it before it locks. Other items including keys and gadgets can be locked away from children, for example, right . David said: 'It all started when I was a student and would come home and eat snacks. 'If it was in the house, I would eat it all. I would get my wife to hide food from me but I always searched the house and found it. 'There are a lot of weight issues in the USA so I thought other people might have a problem with this too, and found a way to solve it. 'You hear about bank safes which can’t open until a certain hour so I thought of that concept. The Kitchen Safe has been listed on Kickstarter in an effort to raise funding for manufacturing. If they reach the £19,400 target, the designer David Krippendorf expects it to go on sale before September this year for £18 . 'The Kitchen Safe physically cannot be opened when the lid is shut. 'In a prototype I had a way you could re-set it by taking out the batteries but it defeated the point. 'When I first started using it I wished it would just open but then I thought ‘OK, I will just have to have an apple or a carrot or something’. 'You can also put things in it like iPhones, which might distract you from something and video games controllers to encourage kids to do their homework.'","The 'Kitchen Safe' locks tempting foods away so you can't eat them .

This is the first glimpse of the 225mph train that will speed between London and the Midlands if the Government wins its fight to build the controversial High Speed 2 rail link. The trains, which will form the first British passenger service to exceed 200mph, have been designed to keep external noise to a minimum. The ultra-aerodynamic nose cone will help the as-yet-unnamed train to operate commercially at 225mph, although in test conditions it could match Japan's 275mph bullet trains. Blast: The first picture of the HS2 has been released . First arrival: The HS2 is similar in design to the speedy Japanese bullet trains . The current top operating speed on UK tracks is 175mph, which is reached on the HS1 route between London and Kent. The fastest passenger train in the world is the CRH380A, which runs between Beijing and Shanghai and has reached 302mph. The design emerged before the divisive Commons vote on HS2 on Wednesday, when up to 40 Conservative MPs are expected to rebel against the £33 billion project.

Mechanical engineering students have developed a shoe that can charge a mobile phone. Four students were able to harness and store the energy produced with each step a person took and use it to charge a telephone. The new PediPower shoes turn motion into phone charge and it is hoped that the same principle may one day be use for life-saving medical devices. Four students at Rice University in Houston, Texas, were approached by Cameron, a company who specialises in equipment and services for the oil and gas industry. They wanted the students to develop new green energy technologies. The self-titled Agitation Squad - Carlos Armada, Julian Castro, David Morilla and Tyler Wiest - decided to focus their attention on what is technically known as a shoe-mounted generator. Another device to draw energy from the motion of the knee had already been developed and patented which led them to analyse other sources of energy from the human body. Working with the Motion Analysis Laboratory at Shriners Hospital for Children in Houston, the team discovered that the force at the heel delivered far more potential for power than any other part of the foot. 'We went to the lab and saw the force distribution across the bottom of your foot, to see where the most force is felt,' Morilla said. Scroll down to watch video . The students - from left, Tyler Wiest, Carlos Armada, Julian Castro and David Morilla - have developed a shoe that captures and stores the energy that is released from the foot's heel when walking . ‘We found it would be at the heel and at the balls of your toes, as you push off. 'We went with the heel because, unless you’re sprinting, you’re letting gravity do the work.' Their devices as currently designed are too big for day-to-day wear, but the prototypes developed at Rice’s Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen with the team’s advisers, David McStravick and Omar Kabir, meet the benchmarks set by Cameron. Days numbered?: The new technology could provide a welcome alternative to plug-in chargers . McStravick is a professor of mechanical engineering and materials science; Kabir is a senior principle research engineer in corporate technology at Cameron. The prototypes deliver an average of 400 milliwatts, enough to charge a battery, in benchtop tests. However the device produces a little less in walking tests, where the moving parts don’t move as far. The shoes send energy through wires to a belt-mounted battery pack. A voltage regulator keeps energy flowing steadily to the battery. The PediPower technology hits the ground before any other part of the prototype shoe. A lever arm strikes first. It is attached to a gearbox that replaces much of the shoe’s sole and turns the gears a little with each step. The gears drive a motor mounted on the outside of the shoe that generates electricity to send up to the battery. ‘It may be worth looking into having both the heel and the ball of the foot produce power, especially if this shoe could be used while running,’ Armada said. A Californian teen has attracted the attention of tech giants Google for her revolutionary invention which charges a phone in 20 seconds flat. The super-fast device has been dubbed a supercapacitor by 18-year-old Esha Khare. So far, Khare has only used the supercapacitor to power a light-emitting diode or LED - but she sees a bright future that one day will see her invention powering cellphones, cars and any gadget that requires a rechargeable battery. The charger is tiny and able to handle 10,000 recharge cycles - ten times more than normal batteries. How an 18-year-old girl has managed to invent something that multi-national corporations have not has led to her being flooded with offers for her amazing leap forward. Google have been in contact with Khare to explore how she plans to change the makeup of cell phone battery life. The students expect the project to be picked up by another team of Rice students in Autumn, with the hope they can refine the materials, shrink the size and boost the power output, all of which will get PediPower closer to being a commercial product. 'If we could prove that we could produce some usable power, store it in a battery and discharge that battery on a mobile device or an MP3 player, then we could prove this device works,' Armada said. 'Now the next team can come in and make it smaller and lighter without sacrificing power.' For now, the team would like to provide enough dependable power for cellphones and other portable electronics. But Cameron has partnered with the Texas Heart Institute to apply its expertise in moving fluids to a new generation of artificial heart pumps, and Rice students hope their work will contribute to that goal. 'Just the fact that you’re relying on human movement to power something that’s critical to your life is a little bit scary,' Armada said. 'You sleep for eight hours a day and you’re not moving. 'You want to make sure you’re making enough power during the day to last. Realistically, this might be more of a device to charge your phone. 'Theoretically it would be something you just wear, and you don’t notice it. That’s the end goal. If you showed someone the shoe while you’re standing still, they wouldn’t even see the device.'","U.S. students have developed PediPower shoes that use the foot's movement to harness and store electricity for a mobile phone .

Her mother Lisa James, 25, found out about her daughter's defect - which affects one in 3,000 babies a year in the UK - when she was 20 weeks' pregnant. 'Pregnancy was terrifying because I did not know what to expect,' she said. 'At 20 weeks, the doctors told us Georgia's intestines were on the outside. I didn't really know what to think.' Georgia, from Newport, south Wales, was forced to spend the first 14 months of her life at Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff. Discovery: Lisa James, 25, left, found out about her daughter's defect when she was 20 weeks' pregnant . Early life: Georgia, from Newport, south Wales, was forced to spend the first 14 months of her life at Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff. Her parents have described her as a 'normal' and 'troublesome' toddler . Unusual condition: Gastrochisis - a rare abdominal wall defect - affects one in 3,000 babies a year in the UK . 'I was there every single day, from first thing in the morning until last thing at night, when she would go to sleep,' said Ms James. 'She has had six operations since birth. The first was at Christmas after she was born. I was terrified. Gastroschisis is a type of abdominal wall defect that occurs when a foetus's abdomen does not develop fully. The intestines usually develop inside the umbilical cord, before moving inside the abdomen a few weeks later. However, in gastrochisis, the abdmonial wall does not form completely, so the intestines develop outside the body. They are then open to the air when the child is born. Only one in 3,000 babies are born with the rare condition every year. In many cases, it is visible on prenatal ultrasound scanning . For more information, visit www.gosh.nhs.uk. 'We spent more time in hospital than at our real home.' For the entire 14 months, Georgia was only allowed off her ward once - for an hour. The 'extreme' nature of her condition meant that doctors were unable to mend the defect. However, her mother and father Scott Diamond were eventually able to bring her home in November last year. 'This Christmas was the best one ever,' said Ms James. ""We had all the family at my house and Georgia had HappyLand toys and musical toys.' But coping with Georgia's condition is by no means easy - with Ms James having to fix a line into her daughter's heart on a daily basis. 'I loved it because it was the first thing I was able to do for her. I had never even been able to change a nappy,' said Ms James. 'We have the equipment to look after her at home with a fridge that we keep all the fluids in. 'It takes half an hour a day to set it up.' Despite her condition, Ms James said Georgia displays 'normal' behaviour for children her age, including a desire to touch and play with objects around her. Optimistic: Scott Diamond said he hopes his daughter 'will be better one day and able to live a normal life' Feeding tube: Ms James is forced to fix a line into her daughter's heart on a daily basis in order to feed her . 'But if she put something in her mouth and swallowed it that would be a concern,' she said. 'It would probably sit in her stomach if she did not vomit it up, and we would have to take her back to hospital.' She added that she hoped Georgia would be able to undergo transplant surgery at Birmingham Children's Hospital within the next two years. Mr Diamond described coping with Georgia's condition as 'hard work' - but said the couple had 'got used to it'. High hopes: The couple hope Georgia will be able to have transplant surgery at Birmingham Children's Hospital . 'It's still not nice but we just have to get on with it,' he said. 'Georgia is growing up and she is always getting into trouble. 'Hopefully when she goes to Birmingham, the doctors will be able to do something for her.

Purses, handbags, pocketbooks: no matter what you call them, you can forget about carrying them with you to your next pro-football game. The National Football League is tightening stadium security starting this preseason, limiting the size and type of bags fans can bring to the game. And since the rule includes standard sized purses, lady fans will soon be crying foul. Scroll down for video... Clearly: The NFL, in the name of public safety, has banned standard sized purses at all NFL stadiums. Only 'hand-sized' clutches and clear totes are now allowed . With the exception of medically necessary items, only clear plastic, vinyl or PVC bags no larger than 12 inches by 6 inches by 12 inches will be allowed. One-gallon clear plastic freezer bags also will be OK, as will small clear plastic bags approximately the size of someone's hand, with or without a handle or strap. One of those clear bags and a small clutch bag will be allowed per person. The NFL says the restrictions are designed to enhance security while speeding up entry into stadiums, but women say feel they’re being targeted. And some say they may even just skip the upcoming season because of the new rule. ‘I don't like this at all,’ Colts fan Cheyenne McMurray told ABC News. ‘I don't want everyone to see what's in my purse. They're still going . to have to search the plastic bag. It's just going to make everyone more . upset.’ Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. Banned items . will include purses larger than a clutch bag; coolers; briefcases; . backpacks; fanny packs; cinch bags; seat cushions; luggage; computer . bags; and camera bags or any bag larger than the permissible size. Female football fan site TheFootballGirl.com is also unhappy with the rule. They write: . 'What . the league considers an improvement to public safety, I consider a . setback for all fans, particularly women. Women carry purses...mostly . because of the functionality. By asking women to leave their purses at . home ...the league is disconnecting from a fan base they are supposedly . working so hard to expand.' Awfully specific: No purses are allowed, but clear plastic totes, which the NFL conveniently licenses, are allowed under strict parameters. Non-licensed totes are also allowed so long as they fit the parameters . Instead of a purse, the NFL is recommending fans take with them clear totes. Conveniently, a line of such totes are licensed to carry the logo of every NFL team. An NFL committee on stadium security recommended these measures in May and the owners have approved them. The NFL ramped up security at the draft in late April, its one major event since the Boston Marathon bombings. Recently, the NFL has done pat downs and bag checks and also used metal detectors to upgrade security. The new policy announced Thursday has worked well at colleges such as Penn State, Michigan and Michigan State, which do not permit any bags in their stadiums. Boston's TD Garden allows only clutch bags. Pack light: Large purse loving women will now have to switch to clutches that fit within very specific parameters if they want to see a live pro football game . ‘Our fans deserve to be in a safe and secure environment,’ Jeffrey Miller, the NFL's chief security officer, said. ‘Public safety is our top priority. This will make the job of checking items much more efficient and effective. We will be able to deliver a better and quicker experience at the gates and also provide a safer environment. We appreciate our fans' cooperation.’ Binoculars, cameras, and smartphones also will be permitted. The league is encouraging fans not to bring any bags to games. A secondary buffer area well outside the stadium will be established where security personnel will check for prohibited items or bags being carried toward the ballpark. Fans with prohibited bags will be turned away until they dispose of those bags. Stadium personnel are being encouraged to have approved bags on hand to give to fans, or to have a place outside the restricted areas to check items, so that fans can reclaim after games.","Starting this season, only purses the size of a person's hand will be allowed into pro games .

Looking polished and contented at a family party, one-time call girl Ashley Dupre, made famous for bedding former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, posed next to her fiancé after it was revealed she was expecting the couple's first child in two months. The New Jersey native revealed to the New York Post that she is set to wed long-time love, Thomas 'TJ' Earle now that he is divorced from the wife he cheated on with Miss Dupre only months after the 'Love Guv' scandal broke. The pair were pictured at a family celebration in New Jersey in April. Much has changed for the one-time prostitute, 27, who, aside from her romantic news, opened a lingerie and swimwear store in Redbank in May. Moving on: Ashley Dupre, the one-time call girl who bedded ex New York governor Eliot Spitzer, is engaged to Thomas 'TJ' Earle and is pregnant . The high life: Ashley Dupre, the former call girl who became world famous for her tryst with Eliot Spitzer, announced she was engaged and pregnant in August . Rumours have been circulating since Femme by Ashley customers started noticing the large 'rock' on Ms Dupre's finger and her obviously swollen stomach, but details of the wedding plans and sex of the baby were being kept a secret. Asked about her pregnancy, Ms Dupre told the Post, 'So far so good!' She and Mr Earle began an illicit affair shortly after news of her dealings with Mr Spitzer hit the headlines but the asphalt heir was still married to wife Alisa with whom he has two children. After meeting at a Jersey Shore restaurant, Mr Earle had reportedly boasted to a friend: 'I could have had her for free.' Scandal number two: Ms Dupre set the rumour mill spinning again in 2008 when she was spotted getting out of a car in New York City with then married Thomas Earle (pictured above) to whom she is now engaged . When their steamy affair was exposed later, the Earle Companies executive publicly apologised to his wife calling his actions a 'grave mistake'.

'Not a financial one, but rather a success in letting people see that I'm more than just the girl in the headlines from 2008.' When Mr Spitzer was accused of paying Ms Dupre $2,000 for sex at a Washington hotel the night before Valentine's Day in 2008, a can of worms was opened that revealed the governor's long time penchant for expensive call girls and culminated in his resignation. Now making headlines for all the right reasons, Ms Dupre says she's 'matured' and has 'moved on' from the scandal. According to Mr Earle's lawyer, Mitchell Ansell, his client and ex-wife Alisa have been divorced for over a year and are on good terms. He confirmed: 'They divorced amicably.

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 20:27 EST, 17 February 2012 . Free-range eggs have outsold those from caged hens for the first time. Last year 51 per cent of the nine billion eggs laid in the UK came from barn, free-range or organic farm hens. The official figures are in stark contrast to 1995, when 86 per cent came from battery cages. Experts believe consumers started switching to free range eight years ago after rules made farmers state how their eggs were produced. Cracking news: 51% of the eggs sold in Britain last year were free range - the first time they have outsold battery . The trend has gathered pace despite free range costing four pence more on average than caged varieties. Many retailers such as Waitrose, the Co-op and Marks & Spencers have stopped selling eggs from caged birds altogether. Barren battery cages were banned by the European Union at the start of this year. Their replacement, ‘enriched’ cages, have perches and litter for pecking but still only give each hen less usable space than an A4 sheet of paper. The RSPCA estimates they are used to rear 16 million hens in Britain to produce eggs mainly for the catering industry. Alice Clark, a senior scientist from the RSPCA's farm animals team, said: 'Things are certainly getting better and hopefully one day cages will be a thing of the past altogether. 'Shoppers who buy cage-free eggs deserve a heartfelt thank you. And if they want to do more they can make sure food they buy such as ready-meals, cakes and ice-cream also contains cage-free eggs. 'This is a massive step forward for animal welfare especially when you consider in 1995 that more than eight out of ten eggs were laid by hens kept in cruel barren battery cages. Free range: Typically non-battery eggs cost four pence more than battery . 'On the downside about 16 million hens in the UK are still kept in cages with less usable space than an A4 sheet of paper each. 'We mustn't forget that many of their eggs will be used in catering, at restaurants or as ingredients in ready-made meals and food such as cakes, sandwiches and ice-cream.' With Shrove Tuesday approaching, the RSPCA is urging consumers to choose free range eggs for their pancake mix. Mark Williams, chief executive of the British Egg Industry Council, which represents producers, said: 'There's a greater demand for non-caged eggs and egg producers have responded to that.' The figures were released in Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) egg statistics for February 2012.","86% of eggs were battery in 1995 .

In light of the claims, Navy Cmdr. Michael P. Ward II, 43, has been relieved of his duties as commanding officer of USS Pittsburgh - a role he began just ten days ago. The unidentified woman from Chesapeake, Virginia said she met Ward on a dating website in October 2011 and he told her he was separated. 'Liar': Michael P. Ward II is pictured leaving the USS Pittsburgh after taking command on August 3. He has been relieved of his duties after a woman said they conducted an affair before he faked his death . Ward, who is in fact married with children, told the woman he worked in 'special ops' and that his name was Tony Moore, she said. 'I want you, but I don't know how to . make this all perfect,' he wrote in a text, which the woman showed to The Day. In another, he wrote: 'I love you . and I always will.' But on July 6, she received an email from a man named Bob, who claimed he worked with Ward. 'Deceptive': Ward told the woman he was separated, but he is married with children . 'He asked me to contact you if this ever . happened,' it said. 'I am extremely sorry to tell you that he is . gone. We tried everything we could to save him. I cannot say more. I am . sorry it has to be this way.' The email concluded: 'He loved you very much', and said Bob had something to pass onto her from Ward. On July 9, she drove to Ward's house in . Burke, Virginia with relatives to pay her respects. But the home's new . owner said Ward was alive and had moved to Connecticut to take over USS . Pittsburgh.

If really you want to cut your grass in a hurry, Honda engineers have created just the job – the 130mph lawn mower. It has been specially adapted from a conventional lawn tractor by the firm’s top British race technicians who have turned it into a super-charged blade-runner. And with performance that will propel it from rest to 60mph in under four seconds it will be a match for many supercars and outpace most family runarounds – if you’re brave enough to sit on it. Scroll down for video . Fast: The Frankenmower can reach speeds in excess of 130mph and goes from 0-60 in less than four seconds . The ton-up lawn-tractor’s creation coincides with the Goodwood Festival of Speed, where the Japanese car-maker announced it was setting up the new F1 racing McLaren-Honda  team headquarters in Milton Keynes. And  it features exclusively in the August special edition of the latest Top Gear magazine to be published on Wednesday July 17 as part of its focus on the Performance Cars of the Year, where the Top Gear team have dubbed it the ‘Frankenmower’. Top Gear magazine’s chief road tester Piers Ward, who took the lawn mower for a spin ahead of their in-house racing driver, the Stig, said: ‘In a Top Gear world littered with stupid stunts, driving a 130mph mower ranks up there as being one of the more unhinged.’ The Frankenmower is based around a . conventional HF 2620HT Honda lawn-mowing mini tractor costing around . £4,000, though that family of mowers starts at around £2,000. Honda’s . Team Dynamics engineers – which runs their touring car race squad - . spent three months adapting it to make it the cutting edge of Blade . Runner racing lawn mowers. First . they ripped out the standard pedestrian 614cc engine and replaced it . with a far more powerful 1000cc engine from a Honda Firestorm VTR motor . bike. It develops 109brake horse-power – roughly the same as a Ford . Fiesta. They fitted a . hi-tech 'spaceframe chassis' like a proper racing car and converted part . of the skirt-like grass collector at the back to contain the fuel tank . and various radiators. The . driver is nevertheless particularly vulnerable. There’s no seatbelt - . the idea being that you are thrown clear in an accident -  no traction . control, no airbag, no ABS anti-lock brakes and no protective roll cage - . so you won’t see it on the road. But it does have a petite fire extinguisher strapped to the rear wing. Souped up: The Frankenmower is based around a HF 2620HT Honda lawn-mowing mini tractor costing around £4,000, but Honda's Team Dynamics engineers  spent three months adapting it to celebrate their re-entry to F1 . Video provided by Top Gear Magazine . Top . speed is 133mph and it will accelerate from rest to 62mph in around . roughly four seconds – performance figures to rival many supercars. But . the whole machine, complete with terrified driver, weighs just 205kg, . which gives it a tremendous power to weight ratio (532bhp/tonne) which . is higher than a super-fast but super light Caterham R500 ( at . 520bhp/tonne). Cutting grass is indeed still possible thanks to two spinning 4,000rpm electric motors with metal brake cables. But ton-up speeds aren’t possible when you’re mowing because with the cutting deck attached, the ground clearance is about a centimetre. The tyres are borrowed from a racing quad-bike and are reported to be ‘as soft as marshmallows’. Top Gear Road-tester Mr Ward explained: 'Apparently, if they were any harder, there’d be so little grip that the mower would swap ends as soon as you got on the throttle.' He added: 'The noise is ridiculous – like the offspring of a nuclear explosion and a machine gun – and it’s spitting small blue and orange flames from the side-mounted exhaust.' Frankenmower features exclusively in the August special edition of the latest Top Gear magazine, whose writers took it for a spin . Describing the sensation riding this ‘flame-spitting garden implement’ on a race-track he said: ‘It feels incredible. 'This must be a bit like how Andy Green felt before he went through the sound barrier in Thrust SSC for the first time.' He said: 'It fires up the pit straight with such ferocity that I’m pretty certain I left some of my internal organs behind. There is absolutely no slack. Instant power, instant gear changes. I’m through the first corner in a blur. ‘But, despite all the noise. It’s actually fairly easy to drive. You’re locked into the tiny seat so tightly that you can feel every single bump. The steering isn’t as brutally sharp as I thought it might be.’ He noted: 'Towards the end of the lap, my confidence gets the better of me, and I decide to see what’s really possible. We hit 100mph, and I must admit to a fleeting thought at this point – if this goes wrong, quite a lot of pain isn’t far away. But the mower and I survive, and as I round the final corner, the red Honda popping and banging like an angry firework.’ Honda spokesman Paul Ormond said it created the ton-up mower to comemorate its re-entry with McLaren into F1 racing from 2015 and its move to new racing HQ in Milton Keynes. ‘We wanted something a bit different to celebrate so we thought a 130mph lawn mower would be jus the job,' he said. He added: 'We still still do sell conventional versions of this lawn mower. They may not do 100mph plus, but they will cut your grass and keep your garden looking smart.’",Honda's Frankenmower goes from 0-60 in just four seconds .
"By . James Tozer . UPDATED: . 20:04 EST, 13 February 2012 . It is a touching memento of her down-to-earth manner. Addressed simply ‘To George’, this hand-written Valentine’s Day card from Princess Diana is not quite the romantic mystery it might at first appear, however. The Daily Mail can reveal that the recipient was none other than George Smith, the royal valet who caused a scandal when he claimed to have been raped by a member of Prince Charles’s household. Bit of fun: The cute card was specially printed and then signed by Diana, pictured together with its recipient, valet George Smith . In fact, the ex-soldier would have received the cute pink card the same year in which he would later claim the attack took place. Up for sale for £8,000, it is part of a package of memorabilia sold by Mr Smith’s family after he died penniless. Diana is believed to have sent similar messages to several favoured servants on cards specially printed in 1989, when she was still married to Charles. Mr Smith’s card – at least the third to be sold – is advertised as addressed to a servant ‘very closely associated and personally employed for many years as a personal valet to the Princess’. It is in reality from the collection of a man who also told the Mail on Sunday in 2003 that he witnessed Prince Charles in a compromising position with a servant. Nice gesture: The front of the card, left, and inside, right, which is personally signed from Princess Diana. It is expected to fetch nearly £8,000 at auction . The former corporal in the Welsh . Guards was Charles’s valet for nine years until being dismissed in 1997, . but was regarded by Diana as an ally during their break-up. The . Falklands veteran suffered from mental health problems and his . scandalous allegations have always been strenuously denied. During . the 2002 trial of former butler Paul Burrell for stealing from Diana’s . estate, it emerged she had kept a recording of his claims. But the tape . vanished. After years of . alcoholism, Mr Smith died in 2004 aged 45, with his collection of cards . and notes from Diana passed to his widow, Yvonne, and their two . children. They are understood to have sold them to dealer Mark Riddle to fund ‘a new life abroad’. Mr . Riddle said the card is ‘part of a few sent by Diana to cheer up . loveless employees’. He added: ‘Not many people can ever have been . handed a Valentine’s card by a princess, let alone one of the most . iconic. It shows her sense of fun and girlishness.’ Riddle, who owns Memorabilia UK, . tasked with selling the extremely rare card, added: 'The family of . George contacted me after his death saying they wanted to sell his . collection of Diana artefacts. 'I . was amazed when I saw it, not many people can ever have been handed a . Valentine’s card by a Princess, let alone one of the most iconic. 'George had a whole host of Diana memorabilia, often signed by her. 'It . is believed to have been part of a few sent by Diana to cheer up . loveless employees, but one, however, cannot imagine she gave out too . many of these.' The pink card - which measures 18x13cm - comes from the 1989 Andrew Brownsword collection and is called 'Lady Di by Dino...' Funny: The Valentine's Day card was anonymously sent by Diana in 1989 when she was still married to Prince Charles. However, it was intended as a practical joke and not a romantic gesture . It shows a teddy bear jumping among . pink hearts and the printed message, 'Hey Valentine! Not Many Men . Receive a Valentine’s Card From Princess Diana.' Inside the message concludes, 'And You’re One of Them', and the Princess has written 'to George, from Diana!' Memorabilia dealer Mr Riddle added: 'You can only imagine the potential worth of this Diana Valentine card in say 100 years time. 'It really shows the Princess’s sense of fun and girlishness. 'Like many rare collectables it is a hard thing to accurately value, but we have currently pricing it at £7,995. 'Hopefully this treasure can be safe-guarded for the next generation to enjoy.' Only one other similar card has ever been discovered, which was addressed to Sgt Lewis, a former soldier who worked for the Royal family. At least two similar cards have . previously been auctioned. One was sold by former royal servant Sergeant . Ronald Lewis for £2,000 while another written to ex-royal chef Mervyn . Wycherley fetched £1,200.","Pink personalised card was sent to a former valet and footman George Smith .

An injured veteran of the war in Afghanistan was kicked out of a shopping mall for speeding on his Segway. Master Sergeant Michael Trost was using the motorized, standing scooter to help him get around due to injuries he sustained while at war. While serving in Afghanistan, Master Sgt. Trost was shot four times. Devalued: Master Sgt. Michael Trost became a hero when he took four bullets for his country in Afghanistan, but was kicked out of a mall for riding a Segway that helped with his injuries . The Purple Heart recipient subsequently spent several months in the hospital recovering from his injuries and continues to experience chronic nerve pain in his legs that hinders his mobility. ‘If I walk long distances’ Trost told WATE, ‘my leg will start hurting. My sciatic nerve was severed, and I can't go long distances. I need to take a break.’ One way he can rest his legs is by using his Segway in favor of walking, but that was one breaking a mall security guard wasn’t willing to give. As Trost made his way through the Foothills Mall in Maryville, Tennessee, a guard stopped him. Ongoing: Trost's still experiences severe pain and is about to have another surgery to help him get around more easily . Pulled over: Despite his pleas and legal use of the Segway, the mall maintained Trost was 'speeding' and causing a hazard to other customers . ‘[He] said I was going to have to take out the Segway,’ Trost said. Trost says he explained to the guard that the device was for mobility. Most businesses are required by law to allow such mobility devices for the disabled. In fact, the Foothills Mall policy explicitly allows Segways ‘inside the shopping center by people with disabilities’ but ‘they must be operated in a safe manner.’ It was the ‘safe manner’ part that Trost was then accused of disobeying. There was no arguing the Segway, which carried a sticker officially designating it as a mobility device, was allowing in the mall, but the security guard claimed Trost was ‘speeding.’ Important: Trost denies he was speeding and says this issue affects all disabled people who require similar mobility devices . And according to the mall, the decision came down to ""the safety and well-being of our shoppers."" Master Sgt. Frost continues to struggle with his health and says, at nearly 50, he has no desire to be disruptive. ‘In fact,’ he said, ‘in a few days, I'm going back up to Bethesda for surgery so the last thing I want to be is disruptive.’ Plenty of Americans would be appalled to hear of the war hero disrespectful experience, but was quick to point out that all disabled Americans and not just veterans are affected by these sorts of incidents. ‘This is not about me,’ he said. ‘This is about other people who also have ADA equipment.’","Master Sergeant Michael Trost, a Purple Heart recipient, sustained four gunshot wounds while serving in Afghanistan and can't stay on his feet for extended periods .

Hours after beleaguered prime minister Yousuf Reza Gilani was reported to have made a ‘panicky’ telephone call to the British High Commissioner in Islamabad appealing for UK help, Mr Hague said: ‘While clearly there is tension, a lot of risks, we must not talk up those risks.’ He refused to comment on reports that Mr Gilani, who is facing a parliamentary vote of no confidence, had made the call. Fears: William Hague is attempting to allay Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Reza Gilani's growing concerns over a military couo . The decision comes at a time of intense friction over an unsigned memo that sought U.S. help in reining in Pakistan’s generals. The fact that Mr Gilani is said to have again gone behind their backs asking the British for help will further damage relations. The army has also warned of ‘serious ramifications with potentially grievous consequences’ after its defence chief was fired. Mr Hague played down coup fears, saying: ‘I don’t see at the moment signs of such panic. Certainly there has been a very tense situation this week.’ However Britain would not interfere in Pakistan’s internal affairs, he said. Tension was ‘very serious’, said a top military official in Pakistan. Judicial view: The Supreme Court of Pakistan will meet on Monday to decide what action to take in the deepening crisis . The Pakistan leader's fears are not, . however, unfounded. The Army has staged four coups in Pakistan's history . and is believed to consider itself the only true guardian of the . country's national interests. It is widely known that the civilian government, headed by Gilani and President Asif Ali Zardari, is not liked by the military. News of the plea for help came after the government fired its defence secretary. Retired Lt. Gen. Naeem Khalid Lodhi, . an army loyalist seen as a bridge between the generals and the civilian . government, was dismissed for 'gross misconduct and illegal action' and . replaced with a bureaucrat close to Prime Minister Yousuf Reza Gilani, . the government said in a statement. The developments are a sign of near-open conflict between the army and the government. Such . is the weakness of Pakistan's state institutions that leaders have . often looked to foreign powers to intervene in domestic affairs. The United States and Gulf . nations have in the past been invited to mediate in disputes between the . country's competing centres of power. They have even been asked to guarantee arrangements struck between these internal figures. The latest flare-up centres on an unsigned memo sent to Washington asking for help to head off a supposed coup following the U.S. raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden and which is being investigated by a Supreme Court Commission. Calmer times: Army Chief Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, right, and Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, left, watch a military exercise. The two men are now say to be on a collision course. As part of the probe the Supreme . court has also ordered the government to open corruption investigations . into Zardari dating back many years. The government has so far refused. Earlier this week, the court said it could dismiss Zardari and Gilani over the case. Judges are convening Monday for what could be a decisive session . plunging the country into a constitutional crisis. The row is . threatening the stability of the country. While . Pakistan's judiciary are widely seen as both corrupt and ineffectual, . they - unlike the army and the judges - have some legitimacy because . they were elected to office. Most . analysts agree that army chief General Kayani has little appetite for a . coup, they say the general may be happy to allow the Supreme Court to . dismiss the government by 'constitutional means.' Pro-democracy campaigners say Pakistan's history of successive military coups and interference in the democratic process by the courts and the army are main cause of the country's current malaise. The nuclear-armed country is facing a host of problems, among them near economic collapse and a virulent al-Qaida and Taliban-led insurgency. The fight against the militants has been complicated by allegations that the country's main Inter-Services Intelligence is supporting some of the insurgents. On Friday, a government-appointed commission investigating the unsolved murder of a journalist last year said that the ISI needed to be more 'law-abiding.' Previous pleas: The Pakistan Supreme Court is investigating claims that the civilian government wrote to Washington asking for support following the U.S. raid on Osama bin Laden's compound int he country, pictured. The report did not find enough evidence to name any perpetrators in the death of Saleem Shahzad,who was killed after he told friends he had been threatened by the ISI. The commission called on the ISI to be made more accountable to the government through internal reviews and oversight by parliament. It said its interactions with reporters should be closely monitored. Also Friday, militants assaulted a police station in the northwestern city of Peshawar, shooting dead three officers and wounding nine others, said police officer Saeed Khan. The Pakistani Taliban have carried out hundreds of attacks on the country's army and other security forces since 2007. The attack came a day after militants armed with guns and grenades killed four Pakistani soldiers in an ambush in the South Waziristan tribal area.","Foreign Secretary William Hague calls for calm during 'very tense situation'

Apple is preparing to launch a smaller version of the multi-million selling iPad, it was claimed yesterday. The little brother of the tablet device would measure fewer than eight inches across the diagonal – considerably smaller than the current 9.7-inch model – and be cheaper. It was also suggested what has been dubbed the 'iPad Mini' could be available in the autumn – in time for Christmas. The competition: Apple's latest iPad on offers a fantastic experience in the hand - put a painful one in the pocket . 'Mid-sized' tablets such as Samsung's Galaxy Note have been big sellers - and have begun to eat into Apple's dominance of the tablet market . Apple is notoriously secretive about . its technical innovations and rumours of the smaller tablet are said to . have originated from the Far East, where many of the company's devices . are manufactured. They were reported by Bloomberg and . the Wall Street Journal, which quoted  several unnamed sources within . Apple's supply chain. A UK spokesman last night said: 'Apple does not . comment on rumour or speculation.' The current iPad costs upwards of . £399 and industry insiders said an 'iPad Mini' would be an obvious . response to competition from rival tablets such as Google's seven-inch . £159 Nexus 7. Far Eastern technology blogs also . hinted that a launch by Apple was imminent. Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu . predicts that the move would be a devastating blow for Android . competitors. 'It would be the competitors' worst nightmare,' he said. The late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, . who died last October, was vehemently against a smaller iPad, saying in . 2010: 'The reason we won't make a seven-inch tablet isn't because we . don't want to hit a lower price point, it's because we think the screen . is too small to express the software.' The iPad Mini would show that Apple is prepared to break away from former chief exec . Steve Jobs' deeply-held mantras.

Weight:       340g                    650gBattery:        9 hours                    10 hours . The Nexus packs a high-definition . screen, the latest 'quad-core' processor, runs the latest version of . Android, and has a battery life which can handle nine hours of . continuous video playback. The firm hopes the tablet will take on . Apple’s iPad. It's part of a new generation of iPad rivals, including Microsoft’s Surface tablet which was revealed . last week, and current Android tablets including Amazon’s Fire. Two versions will be available, one with . 8GB of storage for $199 and a second with 16GB for $249. By comparison, . Apple's new iPad, which has a larger 9.7 inch screen, costs $399 for a . 16GB version. The Windows version of a tablet: The new Surface was unveiled by Microsoft last week . Amazon's Kindle Fire is likely to be hit hard by Apple's new launch - the cheap tablet is also seven inches, but built on unglamorous hardware . Earlier this year, a Samsung official appeared to confirm the existence of a smaller 'iPad Mini', due to be released this year. The official said to a Korean newspaper, 'The amount of the current contract [between Apple and Samsung] is around $9.7billion. 'The contract is expected to rise to $11billion by the end of this . year as Apple is planning to release a smaller iPad, probably with a . 7.85-inch screen, and to sell more of its MacBook Air PCs using . Samsung’s faster solid state drive (SSD) storage.' Microsoft also recently unveiled its own 'Surface' tablet, a touchscreen running its new Windows 8 software. Apple's new tablet will also be a concern to Amazon, as their Android-running tablets, such as the Kindle Fire, have . been runaway successes in the U.S. Kindle . Fire is also a seven-inch tablet, built around the old BlackBerry . PlayBook, but running a customised version of Android focused on selling . videos, apps and music via Amazon's Marketplace. Microsoft has previously tried and failed at bringing Windows tablets to the market. Bill Gates spent the tail-end of the . 1990s trying to convince people that tablets were the wave of the future . - but Microsoft never quite got either the hardware or software working . together, and their early efforts - as long ago as 2001 - never . convinced anyone. The runaway success of 'mid-sized' devices such as Samsung's Galaxy Note, which has a five-inch screen, has helped Samsung gain ground in the tablet market . On the other hand, the risk to Apple . is that a different-sized tablet might lead to fragmentation - where . apps and games need re-configuring by their developers to ensure they . are compatible on both versions. This has been Android's biggest issue in the last few years. Different screen sizes, different . manufacturers, different versions of the operating system and different . price-points all lead to choice for the consumer - but at the cost of . development headaches and an inconsistent experience.","Smaller cheaper machine to launch 'soon' claim factory sources .

Mothers-to-be are opting for Caesareans because they are afraid of poor care if they have a natural birth . Mothers-to-be are opting for Caesareans because they are afraid of poor care if they have a natural birth, a leading midwife has revealed. Around one in four women in the UK has their baby delivered by surgery putting enormous pressure on the NHS. The rate has shot up to this level in the last two decades but is double that in private hospitals. Pippa Nightingale, head of midwifery at Imperial NHS Trust in London, has claimed that some women want Caesareans because they are worried about poor treatment in NHS hospitals. ‘As a midwife working in a busy hospital, I know that some request a planned Caesarean because of fears their care will not be good enough and concern they will not receive enough support during labour and delivery,’ she said. ‘After a discussion of all the pros and cons of both types of birth, and having been assured of one-to-one midwifery support and a personal birth plan, many will often choose to try a vaginal birth. ‘Ensuring women are fully informed about their birth options is important. I am sure this quality standard will be a helpful tool for all involved.’ In 1980, only nine per cent of deliveries were surgical but it has shot up to 20 to 25 per cent. More women are planning so-called designer births in which they book a Caesarean. About seven per cent of NHS surgical births – around 10,000 babies a year – follow a request from the mother for no medical reason. There has been speculation about a trend among modern women ‘too posh to push’ who choose a Caesarean for lifestyle reasons as they do not want to go through labour. Celebrities who have had a surgical birth include singers Victoria Beckham and Mel B, radio presenter Zoe Ball, and actress Patsy Kensit. But there is continuing medical debate on how women who have had one caesarean, for whatever reason, should be advised to deliver in any subsequent pregnancies. A major study in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology said they ran a 50-fold extra risk of a ruptured womb if they attempted to deliver naturally. Around one in four women in the UK has their baby delivered by surgery putting enormous pressure on the NHS. The number of Caesareans has increased dramatically in recent years . New NHS guidelines from the National Institute for health and Care Excellence will make it clear that mothers-to-be must have a documented discussion with members of the maternity team if they need, request or have had a surgical delivery. Nice said there is currently ‘confusion’ among pregnant women about Caesareans. In future, discussions should be arranged ‘promptly’ and usually involve a consultant as they are best placed to advise on risks and benefits. The Royal College of Midwives said the pros and cons compared with vaginal birth must be discussed, especially with women who want surgery because they are worried about childbirth. The guidance is likely to reduce ‘inappropriate’ requests for surgical births, they said. The updated advice says a mother-to-be should be ‘fully supported in her choice’ if she wishes to try for a vaginal birth after a previous Caesarean. Dr Gillian Leng, director of health and social care at Nice, said: ‘Nice has developed this standard because up to a quarter of women are having Caesarean sections. ‘We want to ensure that women who may need or may have had a Caesarean section, or are simply asking about them as an option, have the most up-to-date information about the quality of care they should receive.’","Pippa Nightingale, head of midwifery at Imperial NHS Trust, London, says women fear they will not receive enough support during labour and birth .

"By . Neil Sears . UPDATED: . 03:08 EST, 19 October 2011 . A racehorse owner rammed her Audi into a jockey’s Mercedes late at night, sending it smashing through his front door and causing him to jump naked from his bed. Sheila Lockhart, 63, who had previously visited a pub, then drove home where she was breath-tested by police – and found to be over the limit. Mrs Lockhart, a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, was duly found guilty of drink driving and banned for a year by magistrates. But she has had her conviction overturned after claiming that she had drunk nothing until she arrived home, where she had half a bottle of Prosecco and, to settle her nerves, a ‘homeopathic tonic’ she had bought in Switzerland, not realising it was 15 per cent alcohol. Appeal: Go Ballistic owner Shelia Lockhart, left, had her conviction for drink driving overturned after a court heard she had driven round to the home of Warren Marston, right, and rammed his car over an alleged breach of confidence . The prosecution at Gloucester Crown . Court had claimed that Mrs Lockhart rammed Warren Marston’s car because . she was angry with him for breaking a confidence. She insisted, however, that she had accidentally put her automatic car into ‘drive’ mode when she meant to reverse. The court heard that the strange . incident of the bump in the night took place a year ago at 40-year-old . Marston’s home in Condicote, near Stow-on-the-Wold. Mrs Lockhart, whose most famous horse . is Go Ballistic – which came second in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1999 – . had a long-standing friendship with the National Hunt jockey. Marston, who himself retired from racing in April, rode Go Ballistic on its last competitive outing. Last October, said Mrs Lockhart, she . was approached by the British Horse Racing Assocation to help with . ‘undercover inquiries’ into a trainer who worked with Marston. She immediately told the jockey . because he was a long-standing friend who had gone out with one of her . daughters and she wanted to keep him out of trouble. Shortly afterwards, she said, she . received an ‘abusive and insulting’ call from the trainer under . investigation. She realised the jockey must have told all to the . trainer, and set off to see him. Top runner: Go Ballistic (pictured) was owned by Mrs Lockhart and was ridden by Mr Marston on numerous occasions . According to prosecutor Simon Emslie, . she angrily leapt in her car, drove from her home in Cold Aston, near . Cheltenham, to a pub and then on to Marston’s home to confront him. According to Mrs Lockhart, she was sober at the time and although she had visited the pub, it was only to look for Marston. If her speech sounded slurred it was . because she had taken Mogadon tablets that afternoon. She said: ‘I rang . the front doorbell and tapped on the windows. I remember banging his car . and kicking the bonnet, thumping it, in the hope that I would set off . the alarm and wake him.’ The alarm did not go off so she . resolved to ‘gently nudge’ his car with hers, she said. She then decided . to go home – but put her car in the wrong gear. ‘I went into “drive” and walloped his car,’ she said. ‘I could easily have just driven away because there was no sign of anybody but I wouldn’t dream of doing that. ‘I climbed over the damaged door . frame.

He had some very . fruity words to call me – quite rightly – and told me in no uncertain . terms to get the hell out of it.’ Crash: The home of Warren Marston, which was shunted into by Sheila Lockhart .

A newborn baby girl who was found horrifically buried alive in an Indian forest has died of her injuries. The baby was just one day old when she was found wrapped in a cloth and half buried under earth and gravel last week, in Mandleshwar forest, outside the city of Indore in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. She was rushed to a local government hospital with heavy bleeding from her nose and mouth but tragically died the following day from her injuries. Horror find: Police retrieve the newborn baby girl who was found buried alive in an Indian forest in a suspected case of female foeticide . The baby girl, who was just one day old, was still alive when she was found half-buried in the forest, but died of her injuries two days later in hospital . A policeman carries the baby girl from the forest where she was found. She was taken to a local government hospital where doctors battled to save her life . Police believe the baby was abandoned . in yet another tragic case of the controversial female foeticide and infanticide crisis . that is sweeping India. Officer B Yadav, from Indore Police, said it is suspected the girl’s family had abandoned her and left her to die. He . said: ‘We believe family or a close relative had left the baby girl to . die. We are checking hospital records and recent births and we’re . investigating the case but so far we have no leads. 'As it stands the apparent motive is female foeticide and we have registered the case.' The baby girl was found on June 29th, by . locals Radheshyam Kevat and Jagdish Mangilal, who were working in the . area and heard the baby’s cries. Jagdish Mangilal, 32, who works as a . local tree planter, said: ‘We heard howling and we thought it was some . animal but then we realised it sounded like a baby so we went to check. Doctors at a local government hospital tend to the one-day-old baby. Tragically it was too late to save her . The infant is put in an incubator at the local government hospital. She died the day after she was brought into hospital . Female Foeticide is rife in India, as many families want baby boys to girls . ‘We were so shocked to see a baby moving, it was pretty devastating and we quickly informed the police. It’s amazing the baby survived as the area is crawling with wild hungry animals.’ Female Foeticide is rife in India, as many families prefer having baby boys to girls. It’s a nation wide crisis and recent figures have estimated that there are now 750 females to every 1000 males in the country. A UNICEF report in 2006 revealed that 10 million girls were killed - either before they were born or immediately after - by their parents from 1986 in India. Last year, the medical journal Lancet stated that 500,000 girls in India were being lost annually through sex-selective abortions. Female foeticide, the act of aborting a foetus because it is female, is a major social problem in India where there is a strong preference for sons over daughters. A recent study found 500,000 unborn girls were being aborted every year. A UNICEF report in 2006 revealed that 10 . million girls were killed - either before they were born or immediately . after - by their parents from 1986 in India. The practise is most prominent in Gujarat and the North Indian states, where there are low recorded rates of female children. Female infanticide, the act of killing unwanted baby girls, is a long-standing cultural problem across the whole of the Indian sub continent owing to the patriarchal nature of society. Male children are preferred in the belief they will bring wealth and prosperity to the family while female children are often viewed as burdens. Another factor is the dowry system, where the family of the bride give a large sum of money or valuable goods to the groom and his family. Although the dowry system has been outlawed it continues to be deeply ingrained in Indian culture. Families with several daughters can find the practise of paying a dowry a serious burden. Female foeticide began in the early 1990s as a result of the availability in India of ultrasound techniques capable of determining the sex of an unborn child. As a result, 80 per cent of Indian districts have reported a greater ratio of male to female children since 1991. The practise is believed to have led to an increase in human trafficking with women being bought and sold as brides in areas where there are a greater proportion of men.","The baby was just 24 hours old when she was left for dead .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 03:53 EST, 29 November 2011 . A Teacher who grabbed a flight attendant’s groin and demanded sex after downing almost a pint of whisky was spared jail yesterday so she can keep her job. Katherine Goldberg, 25, groped the airline steward during a flight from Johannesburg to London. Goldberg was given a community order after the judge was told any prison sentence would mean she would not be allowed to teach again. In court: Katherine Goldberg avoided a jail sentence despite admitting to sexually assaulting an air steward during a return flight to the UK . In mitigation, Isleworth Crown Court was told that Goldberg from Ealing, west London was convinced that the man was her boyfriend as a result of her 'alcohol-induced illusion'. ‘I would be wrong to impose a lifetime punishment by preventing you working in a profession where you clearly have talent,’ said Judge Andrew McDowall at Isleworth Crown Court, West London. A prison sentence or a community order longer than 12 months would have meant Goldberg would have had to sign the sex offender register – meaning she could not work with children. South African-born Goldberg was returning on a Virgin Atlantic flight from visiting relatives on August 24. An earlier hearing was told she had drunk at least half a litre of whisky as well as wine. She made a sexual suggestion to a flight attendant trying to look after her and ‘at one point sat on his lap and grabbed hold of his genitals through his trousers.’ South African-born Goldberg was returning on a Virgin Atlantic flight from visiting relatives on August 24. She told police she had a drink problem and admitted being drunk on a plane and indecent assault. She was fined £1,500 and ordered to do 80 hours community work. She has been suspended since the sex assault and her lawyers claimed she was liable to be struck off if she was jailed or placed on the sex offenders' register. The court heard Goldberg had downed 'at least 50 centilitres of whisky' when the incident took place. Support: Goldberg (centre) leaves Isleworth Crown Court with her parents after sentencing for groping a male air steward whilst drunk on an aircraft . Prosecutor James O'Connell said at first . her behaviour on the flight was described by witnesses as 'very . irritating' because she disturbed them while they were trying to rest. She was eventually moved to the . plane's galley where one member of the cabin crew 'took an interest in . her care' and tried to calm her down. Mr O'Connell went on: 'However, it was at this point that the defendant's antics changed and became rather sexual. 'She sat on his lap and grabbed hold of his genitalia through his trousers.' She also spoke to the man suggestively and kept 'making offers to him', the court heard. She was heard to tell the air steward: 'Let me and you go somewhere. You can touch me anywhere you want, I don't mind.' Mr O'Connell said Goldberg was also heard to say the names of two men. He added: 'In her complete alcoholic funk she was confusing him with her current boyfriend, Clayton, and Owen, a previous boyfriend. 'She was somehow imagining this was her boyfriend with whom she was interacting.' Goldberg eventually went to sleep for around an hour but then woke up and continued to be loud and disruptive, the court was told. Eventually she slept again, and remained asleep until the plane landed at Heathrow and she was met by police. Mr O'Connell said she was 'very co-operative' with the officers who questioned her, and admitted she had no recollection of events on board the plane but was very apologetic. The total amount that she had drunk was not mentioned in court but it was believed she consumed her own alcohol that she had taken on board, rather than that supplied by cabin crew. In air: Goldberg assaulted the male crew member on a Virgin Atlantic flight from Johannesburg, South Africa to London Heathrow . The air steward she sexually assaulted, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was said to have been unaffected by the incident. In mitigation, Johnathan Goldberg QC, . for the defence, who is not related to his client, said the case was a . 'man bites dog situation'. He added that it involved 'a very attractive young lady who acts totally out of character and commits a very minor offence'. He told the court the defendant had shown genuine remorse over the incident and had been abstinent ever since. He asked the judge not to give her a custodial sentence as it could jeopardise her career. He told the court that Goldberg was returning from visiting her boyfriend and grandparents in South Africa after going there to celebrate the end of her teaching exams. Passing sentence, Judge Andrew McDowall said it was clear that none of the other passengers had been in any danger during the flight and Goldberg did not have to be restrained at any stage. Addressing her, he said: 'You have the misfortune to suffer from a problem with alcohol and, as has been made plain, it is a matter from which your mother unfortunately suffers from as well. 'You have now reached that vital stage of acknowledging that you have a problem and also showing a willingness to do something about it.' He added: 'It is quite apparent that you are not a menace to children', and said he hoped she would be allowed to continue to teach despite the sexual assault conviction. The court was told that Goldberg has since admitted to having an alcohol problem and now attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings five times a week. She also went on a one-month residential course after realising she had hit 'rock bottom'. Goldberg, who had one previous . conviction for drink-driving, sat in the dock wearing a brown blouse and . black trousers and looked relieved as the sentence was passed.","Katherine Goldberg drank 'a pint of whisky' on the plane before the alleged incident took place .

Vladimir Putin was facing an international storm last night after a lawyer who unmasked corruption among leaders of his United Russia party was jailed for five years. Alexei Navalny, 37, led massive protests against the Kremlin last year and had intended to challenge Mr Putin for the Russian presidency. He was convicted of embezzling £325,000 in a timber deal, after what was denounced by his supporters as a show trial ‘redolent of the Stalin era’. His jailing was widely seen as a tactic to prevent him running for Moscow mayor this year and challenging Mr Putin for the Kremlin in 2018. Foreign Secretary William Hague blasted ‘the selective application of the rule of law in Russia’.Former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Michael McFaul, US Ambassador to Russia, also condemned the political use of courts. Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's biggest critics, was led away from court by law enforcement officers after the judge pronounced the sentence in the industrial city of Kirov. Prosecutors had asked for a six-year sentence. Navalny was found guilty of heading a group that embezzled 16 million rubles (£330,000) worth of timber from state-owned company Kirovles in 2009 while he worked as an unpaid adviser to the provincial governor in Kirov. That was the same year that Navalny, a lawyer, started an anti-corruption blog that attracted a wide following and propelled him into becoming a key opposition figure. It was Navalny who called the dominant United Russia party 'the party of crooks and thieves' - a phrase that became a rallying cry for the nascent opposition to Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin. Backers say he is innocent, calling the trial unfair and the evidence against him shoddy. The U.S. and EU both criticszed the ruling within hours, arguing that the case appeared to be politically motivated. While waiting for the sentence for him and co-defendant Pyotr Ofitserov - who was also found guilty of embezzlement - Navalny played with his smartphone and occasionally smiled sardonically. A post on his Twitter account during the long verdict reading noted the thick packet of papers the judge was reading and said: 'We're going crazy while we listen.' Ofitserov ran a timber trading company in Kirov during Navalny's time in the region. Navalny was a top leader of the wave of massive protest rallies that broke out in late 2011 after a national parliamentary election scarred by allegations of widespread fraud. Scroll down for video . Yesterday: A post on Navalny's Twitter account during the long verdict reading noted the thick packet of papers the judge was reading and said: 'We're going crazy while we listen' Defiant: Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, centre, and his former colleague Pyotr Ofitserov, foreground, listen to the judge in a court in Kirov during yesterday's sentencing . More recently, he pushed his ambitions by declaring himself a candidate for this autumn's Moscow mayoral election. The conviction does not immediately nullify his candidacy. That wouldn't happen until his defense team exhausted its appeals, which could take several months. It's unclear whether the conviction would intimidate his supporters or undermine the activists who have coalesced around him. The judge said he found the testimony of key prosecution witness Vyacheslav Opalev to be 'trustworthy and consistent.' Opalev, who was the timber company's general director, got a suspended sentence in an expedited trial in December after pleading guilty to conspiring with Navalny. Well-wishers: Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, right, shakes hands with opposition lawmaker Ilya Ponomarev before his sentencing . Navalny insists Opalev framed him out of revenge. Navalny had recommended that Opalev be fired and that officials investigate potential corruption in his company, which had incurred 200 million rubles (£4million) in losses by the time Navalny arrived in the region. Throughout the trial, testimony of prosecution witnesses clashed with the core arguments of the indictment that claimed Navalny's work in Kirov led to the embezzlement. None of the managers at Kirovles who appeared in court, except for Opalev, were able to confirm that Navalny defrauded the company. Navalny had long said he expected to be convicted, and in a final blog post before leaving Moscow for Kirov, he downplayed his personal importance to the wider opposition. 'The most important thing is to muster up the strength, shake off laziness and do something. This doesn't require any leadership as such,' he wrote.","Alexei Navalny found guilty of embezzling £330,000 worth of timber .

Doing it alone: In parts of the North of England, 75 per cent of families are headed by a single parent. Most of them are mothers . A million children are growing up in ‘men deserts’, living without a father and rarely meeting an adult man, a study of family breakdown said yesterday. It said the continuing increase in the number of lone parent families means that in some areas three out of four families are headed by one parent. Their children, most of whom are growing up without fathers, lack the influence of men not only at home but also in the other key areas of their lives, the report from the Centre for Social Justice said. In particular few ever meet men at school. One in four of all primary schools has no male teacher and four out of five have fewer than three, it found. The report described the impact of family breakdown as an ‘emergency’ and said that the response of politicians of both Left and Right has been ‘feeble’. It urged David Cameron to ‘get a grip’. The findings are potentially embarrassing for the Prime Minister because the Centre for Social Justice is the brainchild of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who launched it in 2004 shortly after being deposed as Tory leader. Its director Christian Guy said: ‘For all of the promises the Conservatives made in opposition, hardly anything has been done to resist the tsunami of family breakdown battering the United Kingdom.’ The study, Family Breakdown: The State Of The Nation, said numbers of lone parent families are rising by 20,000 a year and will reach a total of two million before the next election in 2015. Some areas are dominated by single parent families, it found. In one area of Sheffield, Manor Castle, 75 per cent of households with dependent children are lone parent families. In Liverpool Riverside, Birmingham Ladywood and Bidston and St James in Birkenhead, the level is more than 70 per cent, and in 15 other places more than 60 per cent. In all, 236 localities have more than 50 per cent of homes with children headed by a sole mother. Male figures: On top of a million children having no worthwhile contact with their fathers, the lack of male primary school teachers is adding to the crisis in male role models . Founder: Iain Duncan Smith launched the Centre for Social Justice in 2004. Its report said David Cameron needs to 'get a grip' on the situation . League Table: The report said the lack of male role models is a national crisis but that parts of the North of England are the worst-off . The report said half of all children . now being born will not grow up with both their birth parents and that . in all a million children have no worthwhile contact with their fathers. It . added: ‘Lack of male role models in many young lives is further . compounded by the dearth of male teachers within state primary schools. Money matters: Single parent households are costing taxpayers £46 billion a year . Although . these trends are nationwide, they are particularly pronounced in our . poorest communities where two thirds of all young adolescents have seen . their parents part.’ It said the costs of family break-up were ‘devastating’, adding that children from broken families are 50 per cent more likely to do badly at school, struggle to make friends, find it difficult to control their behaviour, or to overcome anxiety and depression. The report estimated the cost of family break-up, including the price in benefits for state support of families without work, at £46billion a year, or £1,541 for each taxpayer. It projected that the bill will rise to £49billion by 2015. The main engine of family break-up, it said, is the spread of cohabitation. ‘It is the instability of cohabiting couples rather than a surge in divorce rates that is fuelling the disintegration of the UK family,’ the report said. ‘Since 1996, the number of people cohabiting has doubled to nearly six million. Cohabiting parents are three times more likely to separate by the time a child is aged five than married couples.’ Since the election Mr Cameron has failed to act on his pledge to give a tax break to married couples. He has, however, promoted same-sex marriage even though there was no mention of the subject in the Tory manifesto or the Coalition agreement.","Number of single-parent families rising by 20,000 each year .

With just £1,000 in the bank and one part-time employee, the Belleville Brewing Company is hardly in a position to threaten the global dominance of the world’s biggest drinks producer. But Anheuser-Busch, the powerful US corporation which numbers Budweiser among its brands, apparently thinks otherwise. Lawyers acting on its behalf have written to the group of parents who run Belleville demanding that they drop the name or else face court action which could bankrupt them with legal fees. The US giant claims that customers could confuse Belleville’s ales and its own fruit-flavoured Belle-Vue beer. Anheuser-Busch, which produces Belle-Vue beers, pictured left, has threatened a Wandsworth microbrewery called Belleville Brewing Company, pictured right, with legal action unless it changes it name . The heavy-handed intervention has shocked the fledgling British business, which is named after the popular state school attended by the children of Belleville’s two directors – real ale fans Adrian Thomas and Mark McGuinness-Smith. Potential investors are also required to have a child at Belleville Primary in Wandsworth, South London, to ensure the small-scale enterprise retains its community links. Mr Thomas, 50, said: ‘The legal threat is ludicrous because the products are completely different. ‘Belle-Vue is a Belgian fruit-flavoured beer with a tart taste. Our beer is made with American yeast and hops and is more like a pale ale. None of the shops and pubs we supply are more than a few miles away.’ However, Anheuser-Busch – which last year generated revenue of  nearly $40billion (£26 billion) – has  made the extraordinary claim that consumers could confuse the two. Shocked: Five of the founding members of the Belleville Brewing Company, pictured from left to right are Adrian Thomas, Mark NcGuinness, Guy Martin, Olivier Chatriot and Stephane Rognan, were stunned by the heavy-handed intervention . A warning letter, drafted by British . lawyers hired by the Missouri-based company to protect its UK commercial . interests, says: ‘Visually and aurally, Belle-Vue and Belleville share . the first six letters in common and end with the same letter “e”. ‘Conceptually, both Belle-Vue and . Belleville would be understood by the English-speaking consumer as . signifying something beautiful. ‘As a result of this considerable degree of similarity .  .  . your use [of the name] is bound to lead to deception and confusion among the public and our clients’ consumers and potential customers. ‘Such use also enables you to take unfair advantage of, or free ride on, our clients’ reputation in the EU.’ The letter, from Bristol law firm Humphreys & Co, demands the destruction of all packaging and promotional material bearing the microbrewery’s name and the removal of any references to Belleville on the company’s website within 28 days. Lawyers for Anheuser-Busch claims the name Belleville could easily be confused with Belle-Vue beers by English-speaking consumers . Anheuser-Busch claimed the level of similarity between the names would lead to deception and confusion . Mr Thomas, a musician who played guitar and keyboards with Tubular Bells creator Mike Oldfield in the 1990s – said his first instinct was to defy the threat of a High Court injunction. But after consulting colleagues, he decided a more prudent course would be to choose another name. One option under consideration is Northcote, the name of a road in Wandsworth. Mr Thomas started home-brewing in his kitchen and offered his ale for the first time at a beer festival organised by the parent-teacher association at Belleville. His nine-year-old son, Callum, attends the school and elder son Jake, now 11, is a former pupil. Mr Thomas added: ‘There is only one member of Belleville staff – me – and I don’t draw a salary. ‘The legal action must have been triggered when we registered the name. We feel coerced and bullied. It’s as if they’re saying, “We have more money than you, so you’ve got to do as we say.” A UK spokesman for Anheuser-Busch, whose chief executive Carlos Brito last year received a £2.7 million bonus, said: ‘We are unable to comment on ongoing legal matters.’ No relation: Belleville School in London is entirely separate from the Belle-Vue brand of beer . Simple idea: Two directors of the Brewery suggested the name Belleville after the popular school their children attened in Wandsworth .","US corporation Anheuser-Busch produces fruit-flavoured Belle-Vue beer .

One World Trade Center has officially been declared the tallest building in the U.S. at 1,776 feet today. The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat made the decision on Tuesday after debates over whether One WTC's 408-foot spire could be considered part of the total height. One World Trade Center had faced some stiff competition from the Willis Tower in Chicago - coincidentally the city where the committee is based. Onward and upward: One World Trade Center towers above all other buildings in Manhattan's Financial District and has now been declared the tallest building in the U.S. One World Trade Center towers over downtown Manhattan as seen from Brooklyn. It is scheduled to open next year . New look: The spire of 1 World Trade Center was lit up for the first time on last Friday . Rising from the ashes of 9/11, the new World Trade Center tower has punched above the New York skyline to reach its powerfully symbolic height of 1,776 feet and become the tallest building in the country. The committee of architects, recognized as the arbiters on world building heights, had met to decide whether the tower in the Big Apple or the Windy City was the loftiest. One World Trade Center stands as a monument to those killed in the terrorist attacks and a ruling against the spire would have dimmed the significance of its height which symbolizes America's founding year of 1776. Without the needle, the building measures 1,368 feet. What's more, the decision was . made by an organization based in Chicago, whose cultural and . architectural history is embodied by the Willis - formerly Sears - Tower. Tallest towers: Willis Tower, formerly known as the Sears Tower, in Chicago on March 12, 2008 (left) and One World Trade Center in New York on September 5, 2013 (right) Topping out: The 104-floor One World Trade beats out 110-floor Willis Tower - now that its spire is deemed admissible - and is shown in comparison to the world's other tallest buildings . 'Most of the time these decisions are not so controversial,' said Daniel Safarik, an architect and spokesman for the nonprofit Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. The 30 members of its Height Committee met to render a judgment behind closed doors in Chicago, where the world's first skyscraper appeared in 1884. The question over One World Trade . Center, which remains under construction and is expected to open next . year, arose because of a change to the design of its tower-topping . needle. Colorful: The new World Trade Center tower has punched above the New . York skyline to reach its powerfully symbolic height of 1,776 feet and . become the tallest building in the country. Or has it? To the point: A committee of architects recognized as the arbiters on world building heights is meeting in Chicago to decide whether a design change affecting One World Trade Center's needle disqualifies its hundreds of feet from being counted . Under the council's current criteria, spires that are an integral part of a building's aesthetic design count; broadcast antennas that can be added and removed do not. The designers of One World Trade Center had intended to enclose the mast's communications gear in decorative cladding made of fiberglass and steel. But the developer removed that exterior shell from the design, saying it would be impossible to properly maintain or repair. Without it, the question is whether the mast is now primarily just a broadcast antenna. According to the architecture firm behind the building, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP, the needle will have a communications platform for radio and television equipment. If the matter weren't so steeped in emotion it might have set off some of the good-natured ribbing emblematic of the history of one-upmanship between New York and Chicago. But One World Trade Center is a monument to American resilience admired well beyond Manhattan. 'I don't think anybody's going to argue with the pride in building that new tower,' said 31-year-old software developer Brett Tooley, who works across the street from the Willis Tower. 'Not only is it going to be the tallest building; it's going to be one of the strongest buildings in the history of America. It's a marvel of engineering.' From great heights: Anna Kane, five,  looks down from the glass balcony called The Ledge, suspended 1,353 feet in the air and jutting four feet out from the Willis Tower's 103rd floor Skydeck . 'We take our hats off to them out here in Chicago and the Midwest,' said Robert Wislow, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Equities, the firm that manages the Willis Tower. 'And we welcome the building to the elite club of the tallest buildings in the world. Nobody's looking at this like a competition.' The Willis has a central place in Chicago's history, speaking to the city's own tradition of recovering from adversity ever since the 1871 Great Fire and its history of creating architectural marvels, said Peter Alter, an archivist at the Chicago History Museum. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, headquartered in Chicago, also designed the Willis, which opened as Sears Tower in 1973 and remained the tallest building in the world until 1996 when the council ruled that the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, had knocked it from the top spot. And the Willis can still claim to get visitors up higher: The highest occupied floor in the 1,450-foot (not including antenna height), 110-story Willis Tower is still higher up than that of the 104-story One World Trade Center. Rising from the ashes: One World Trade Center, built at the site of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York . At the Willis' 103rd floor thrill-seekers can step out into one of the glass boxes known as The Ledge that extend outside the building's steel frame and look straight down 1,353 feet. In New York, the debate was upsetting to Jim Riches, a retired fire department deputy chief who lost his 29-year-old firefighter son, Jimmy, in the terrorist attack. 'You know what? I think it's a ridiculous argument. It doesn't matter to me what height it is,' he said. 'You know, my son's not going to walk back in that door again. And that's the big thing. He's gone.'","The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban .

The graduates at London's Royal College of Art trumped their peers with their latest catwalk collections. Some of the most unusual styles came from menswear designer Lucie Vincini who accessorised her models with gold mouthpieces that hung from their mouths exposing their teeth. Suffering for their art: The models showcasing Lucie Vincini's collection wore painful-looking gold mouthpieces . The fashion statement is a no-no for anyone self-conscious about their gnashers or anyone with a fear of the dentist - given it looks like a painful implement that you might expect to endure when sat in the chair for treatment. When it came to their clothing, some of Vincini's male models wore diamante skull caps, while for footwear they all wore trainers. The young designer hinted that she wants to make double denim (or even triple denim) an acceptable trend with one of her styles involving a man wearing a denim skirt over denim trousers with a shirt of the same fabric. Layered look: Vincini's menswear range was heavy on denim, left, and multiple garments worn at once . Remember me: Branded tops ensure everyone knows the name of the graduate designer behind the gold accessories . Another of her models took layering to a new extreme wearing multiple garments topped off with a large white quilted jacket. Not to be out done on the catwalk, another of the student fashion designers had some eye-catching styles on display in her collection. Japanese designer Maiko Takeda had an array of spiky headwear on show that looked like it had been inspired by nature. Some of her pieces were reminiscent of a hedgehog while another looked like a furry caterpillar wrapped around a model's head. Inspired by nature?

Takeda writes on her website that her aim is to 'create an experience of wonder and bewilderment for the adorned.' And her hats seem to do the trick as it appears the wearer cannot see where they are going thanks to some of spiky styles covering their whole face. And one might wonder who would actually wear them. The designer carried the spiky theme into her clothing range and this did seem more wearable with one style covering the shoulders like a futuristic fur stole. Monochrome overload: James Pilcher's menwears range focused on geometric black and white designs . Spice Girl-style platforms complete the unusual look . Another menswear collection that made a statement was James Pilcher's monochrome range.

Chris Dolan, the family’s lawyer, said they continued to 'fight to save' the 13-year-old who was declared brain dead after an operation to remove her tonsils. He and the family successfully campaigned to stop Children’s Hospital, in Oakland, California, from turning off a ventilator keeping her heart beating and had her transferred to another medical facility. Fight for life: Jahi's mother Nailah Winkfield and her brother, Omari Sealey, pictured outside Oakland Children's Hospital last month . But the lack of brain function and three weeks without proper nutrition have taken their toll, and doctors were struggling to reverse the deterioration of her body, he said. Medical emergency: Jahi McMath was declared brain dead after a tonsil operation went wrong . Papers filed by the hospital for a now cancelled court case today, also showed that the body was showing serious signs of decay and only the 'illusion of life'. 'We believe that as long as her heart is still pumping she is still alive,' her uncle, Omari Sealey, insisted to Piers Morgan. 'Right now we are just taking it one day at a time. We are happy where she is right now, that we were able to remove her safely from Children’s Hospital. 'She is moving a lot more. She responds to audio and touch and more compelling evidence is that she can move her head and neck.' His voice cracked as he told how all the family wanted was to see Jahi smile again. 'Jahi is a very sweet girl,' he said. 'She . is very shy and she smiled all the time and I can still see her smile . and I am still praying that one day I will be able to see her smile once . again. 'She is everybody’s favourite. She had that kind of personality that you just gravitated towards. 'It . is very tough that we are unable to communicate with her.

Hope: Omari Sealey, pictured with Jahi's grandmother Sandra Chatman, says he wants to see his niece smile again . His comments came as papers issued for a district court case to discuss the original injunction, due to expire today, revealed the mountain the family have to climb. Dr Heidi Flori, a Children's Hospital Oakland paediatrician, wrote that there were clear indications that Jahi's body was deteriorating. She said that because of brain stem damage, Jahi could not regulate life sustaining functions such as heart rate, temperature and breathing. The tissues under her skin were losing their elasticity, and her muscles were contracting, she said. Her blood pressure spiked but was gradually declining and was now half what it was, she added, and blankets were needed to maintain a constant temperature. Battle: Nailah Winkfield won the fight to keep her daughter on life support . 'This deterioration became inevitable the moment she died,' Dr Flori said. 'Additional and more dramatic signs of the body's deterioration will continue to manifest over time, regardless of any procedures and regardless of any heroic measures that any facility might attempt. 'Mechanical support and other measures taken to maintain the illusion of life where none exists cannot maintain that illusion indefinitely.' She concluded that further interventions would not bring her back to life, saying they could be counter productive resulting in her heart stopping.","Doctor's notes claim Jahi's body is showing signs of decay .

A mother-of-two feared she would go blind when her face dramatically ballooned after she used Piz Buin sun cream. Joanna Stockton, 36, claims the lotion should be pulled from the shelves because her face swelled so much her eyes could not open following a severe allergic reaction. Her problems started within 48 hours of using the Piz Buin cream on holiday with her family, which left her blind in one eye. Frightened: Joanna Stockton says Piz Buin made her face swell up like this, leaving her unable to see out of one eye . She was in Majorca with her husband and two young children aged five and three, and had to have steroid injections to bring the swelling under control. Mrs Stockton, from Stansted, Essex, said she was terrified she would go completely blind and had to stay inside for a week until the swelling went down. 'It was incredibly frightening. I bought the sun cream as a health product to protect my skin, but it actually made it worse,' she said. 'I applied the lotion on the first day of my holiday and when I woke the next morning there were red itchy bumps over my arms and legs, a bit like a nettle rash. 'The rash got worse and worse and a day later my head was so swollen my eyes had become slits, it was horrendous.' Mrs Stockton said she had an anti-histamine to try and control the swelling, but it had no effect and by tea time that day one eye had completely closed. 'My whole face was throbbing and I was frightened I would go completely blind,' she said. 'I lost all the features on my face and couldn't smile or move my mouth properly.' Getting better:  The 36-year-old had to have steroid injections to bring the swelling under control in Spain . Before: Joanna with one of her children, before she put the cream on her face in Majorca . The emergency doctor visited her apartment and gave her two steroid injections and a course of steroid creams and after three days the swelling started to go down. Last week, Piz Buin sun cream featured on . the BBC's Watchdog show after producers were inundated with . health complaints about it. Leading . dermatologist Dr Ian White, of St John's Institute of Dermatology in . London, said two of the cream's ingredients could be the reason . for the severe reactions he had seen. He . said his organisation had demanded urgent action into the safety of one . of the chemicals used in Piz Buin, C30-38 Olefin/Isopropyl Maleate MA . Copolymer, two years ago. He . also claimed that one in 10 of the patients he now sees were allergic . to another active ingredient in the cream - Methylisothiazolinone. But she was left with cuts all over her face where her skin had been swollen and stretched. 'It completely ruined my holiday as we were only there for a week. I was in a lot of pain and had to stay inside out of the sun,' she said. 'To make matters worse, when I got back home my whole face peeled as if I'd had sun burn and I was left with really dry skin. 'I used the sun lotion on the children too and I'm just so relieved they didn't have the same reaction.' Mrs Stockton, who was on holiday earlier this month, was offered a refund by Johnson & Johnson, the makers of the sun lotion, which she claims was to blame for her allergic reaction. But she says she wants to see the product pulled from the shelves. Yesterday Marie Goldie, 37, of Glasgow, who was on holiday with her partner and two teenage children in Tenerife, Spain, was taken to hospital days after she started using Piz Buin 1 Day Long. Doctors at a hospital in Playa de las Américas feared the catering worker’s reaction was so bad she would require an emergency operation - but steroid injections eventually brought it under control.

Viktor Sedov, 65, who had performed at the world-famous theatre in Moscow for four decades, died in hospital as a result of his injuries following the fall on Tuesday. Bolshoi spokesman Katerina Novikova said Mr Sedov, who played in the second violins, was a much-loved member of the theatre and was known for his 'sense of humour and extraordinary erudition'.

In January this year, an artistic director at the Bolshoi nearly lost his sight when he had acid thrown in his face outside his Moscow home. Sergei Filin, 42, suffered third-degree burns to his face and neck in the attack. However dancers and staff at the Bolshoi later suggested that Mr Filin may have staged the attack himself. Last week the theater's director general Anatoly Iksanov was fired and replaced by Vladimir Urin, who previously headed Moscow's Stanislavsky Musical Theatre.

Lord Justice Leveson last night dismissed criticism that his inquiry into Press standards had been undermined by revelations of an affair between two key lawyers. He insisted there was ‘simply no room’ for a ‘breach of confidence or other conspiracy’ as a result of the relationship between Carine Patry Hoskins, a member of his legal team, and celebrities’ barrister David Sherborne. But the High Court judge declined to answer a series of crucial questions about the relationship, which was revealed by the Daily Mail and has raised concerns over whether it undermined the integrity of his inquiry. Affair: Celebrities' barrister Mr Sherborne and  Mrs Patry Hoskins, a . member of Lord Justice Leveson’s legal team,  claim their relationship . did not start until after the inquiry . Twice-married Mr Sherborne, 44, and Miss Patry Hoskins, 40, admit going on holiday together to Santorini in August – days after months of public hearings at the inquiry ended – but claim their affair did not begin until after the Leveson report was published in November. The couple did not tell Lord Justice Leveson or his senior counsel, Robert Jay QC, about the affair. The judge only learnt of their trip to the Greek island – during which they say they discussed ‘the possibility of a future relationship’ – when the Mail asked him to comment on it. MPs have demanded that Lord Justice Leveson launch a full investigation, and a series of questions about who knew what and when remain to be answered. Last night Tory MP Nick de Bois said: ‘Lord Justice Leveson gives the impression of dismissing this out of hand. I would have thought in the interests of transparency that this would have deserved a more considered and substantive response.’ Carine Patry Hoskins: Questioned more than 50 witnesses . The Daily Mail put these questions to Lord Justice Leveson and his senior counsel at the inquiry, Robert Jay QC. We await their reply. THE AFFAIR . Mr Jay says he first learnt of a ‘personal relationship of any sort’ between David Sherborne and Carine Patry Hoskins on March 18, 2013, and later informed Lord Justice Leveson. But their relationship has apparently been the talk of fellow lawyers for a year and the couple were regularly seen having coffee in the Delaunay brasserie, close to the Royal Courts of Justice where they sat on opposite sides of the inquiry. 1: How did Mr Jay learn of the relationship? 2: Was he aware of legal gossip surrounding the couple circulating for up to a year? 3: What was he told of the affair and when did he inform Lord Justice Leveson? 4: Why did Mr Jay decide he should inform Lord Justice Leveson that Mr Sherborne and Miss Patry . Hoskins were in a relationship when he learned about it? Was it because he recognised it might give rise to a concern that the proper conduct of the inquiry may have been affected? THE GREEK HOLIDAY . Both Lord Justice Leveson and Mr Jay say they only learnt of the Santorini holiday last week. But the couple flew to the Greek island in August, a few days after the public hearings at the inquiry finished and three months before the publication of the Leveson report. 5: How and on what date did they discover the couple had travelled to the Greek island? 6: Do they think that they should have been consulted by Miss Patry Hoskins about any planned trip to Santorini? If they had been, what would have been their position? 7: Have Mr Sherborne or Miss Patry Hoskins been asked to make sworn statements about their relationship and the trip to Santorini? THE ‘WOMAN ON THE LEFT’ Lord Justice Leveson said at the weekend: ‘There is no suggestion in the facts as we understand them to be that Ms Patry Hoskins’s work for the inquiry was in any way affected by her developing relationship with Mr Sherborne.’ The judge says Miss Patry Hoskins’s role after the public hearings – where she became known on social media as ‘woman on the left’ – ended in July was merely collating facts and proof reading. But during the public hearings she questioned more than 50 witnesses, including seven of Mr Sherborne’s clients. Her role was to be scrupulously independent. 8: Have Lord Justice Leveson or Mr Jay spoken directly to Mr Sherborne or Miss Patry Hoskins about their relationship? 9: What steps have been taken to ensure Miss Patry Hoskins’s collation of facts was not tainted by her relationship with Mr Sherborne? 10: Given that interested parties’ questions for witnesses could only be put via the inquiry legal team, are Lord Justice Leveson and Mr Jay content that Miss Patry Hoskins carried out her role entirely impartially? BEST BEHAVIOUR . This was one of the most high-profile public inquiries. Senior legal sources with experience of Leveson-style proceedings say they would have warned their legal teams to be careful. 11: At the start of the inquiry, did Lord Justice Leveson or Mr Jay issue any guidance to the inquiry’s legal team about behaviour during the proceedings? PUBLIC PERCEPTION . Questions have been raised about the perception of the impartiality of the inquiry as a result of the disclosure of the relationship between Mr Sherborne and Miss Patry Hoskins. 12: What comment do Lord Justice Leveson and Mr Jay have on this? Rob Wilson, parliamentary aide to . Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, wrote to the judge at the weekend . urging him to examine the implications of the relationship. He said: ‘In . the interests of transparency and in maintaining public confidence in . the complete integrity and impartiality of your inquiry, I strongly urge . you to make inquiries and to get to the bottom of this matter without . delay.’ The Tory MP has also asked the Bar . Standards Board to consider whether the two barristers have breached the . Bar’s Code of Conduct. In his reply to Mr Wilson yesterday, . Lord Justice Leveson said he would not comment on ‘what, if any’ action . the Board decides to take. Holiday together: The pair went on a break to the island of Santorini (pictured) in Greece . Not informed: Lord Justice Leveson was not told about the affair and only learned about the couple's holidaying together in the past week . ‘As for the integrity and impartiality . of the inquiry, I know exactly what work I asked Ms Patry Hoskins to do . after August 3 (by which time the hearings had concluded) and I have . reminded myself of the dates and precise work she did, in fact, . undertake in the months that followed and the material to which she had . access,’ he said. MP letter: Rob Wilson wants Bar Standards Board to examine whether there may have been a breach of the code of conduct . ‘I need to make no further inquiry: . she did exactly what I had requested. She had absolutely no input into . any conclusion as to the past treatment of those affected by Press . abuses (or indeed the relationship between the Press and the public as . considered by Module 1 of the inquiry) or any aspect of the proposals . made for future Press regulation. She was simply not involved in any of . this work.’ The judge, in his third statement in . five days about the affair, said Miss Patry Hoskins’s involvement after . August 3 was ‘confined to the collation of facts’ concerning the . historical relationship between the Press and politicians. ‘In that . period, save for some proof reading in the final few days before . publication, she did not see and was not involved in any discussions . about the other sections of the report or, indeed, in any of my eventual . recommendations,’ he said. ‘There was simply no room for a ‘‘breach of . confidence or other conspiracy’’ as a result of personal relations . between her and Mr Sherborne.’ Mr Wilson was disappointed with Lord . Justice Leveson’s response. He said: ‘Lord Justice Leveson seems . to have accepted that the two barristers went on holiday “to discuss the . possibility of a relationship” at face value. It is rather surprising . that he seems unwilling to investigate whether anything was going on . before this time.’ Mr Sherborne, a father of three, represented Hugh . Grant and other phone-hacking victims at the inquiry whose public . hearings ran from September 2011 to July 2012. Miss Patry Hoskins, dubbed the . ‘thinking man’s Pippa Middleton’, was required to be totally independent . when testing evidence given to the inquiry on behalf of the public. She . questioned witnesses, including Mr Sherborne’s clients, with grievances . against the Press, and trended on Twitter as #womanontheleft after . being spotted by viewers who suggested she was making eyes at Mr Grant.

Rolling Stone magazine is in trouble with its readers who are outraged over the forthcoming August 3 issue which features Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover. The image is a self-taken portrait of Tsarnaev in which he looks more like a rock star than a terrorist. He is identified simply as ‘The Bomber’ and the article promises to explain ‘how a popular, promising student was failed by his family, fell into radical Islam, and became a monster.’ The use of Tsarnaev as a cover star has caused an instant backlash on social media, with more than 2,500 people leaving angry comments on the magazine’s Facebook page. Rolling Stone magazine has been accused of glamorizing Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev by featuring him on its cover . Almost all the comments express anger and displeasure at the choice of the alleged bomber and a large number of commenters have threatened to cancel their subscriptions. This isn’t the first time this particular image has been used in the media since the April 15 Boston Marathon bombing, which Tsarnaev stands accused of carrying out with his brother, Tamerlan. The photo appeared on the front page of The New York Times in May. However the cover of Rolling Stone is typically occupied by rock stars and actors, and many feel the cover is glorifying Tsarnaev, who is accused of killing three people and wounding more than 260. The decision to go with the bombing suspect has been widely lambasted as tasteless. Comments left on the magazine Facebook page have include: . Rolling Stone readers have complained on social media platforms about how the image of Tsarnaev is tasteless and makes him look like a rock star . ‘Very un-American. F**k you Rolling Stone. I thought it was supposed to be an honor to be on your cover?’ 'Whoever subscribes to this worthless rag should cancel their subscriptions TODAY!!! This is unacceptable!! 'I shared this on my news feed, but not in support of your magazine, I shared it to show people how low you have gone by putting this terrorist on your cover. Rolling Stone, go and read all the shares of your picture, there are a lot of angry people that you would make such a disgusting choice.' On Twitter people have commented about said the picture of Tsarnaev looks similar to an old cover featuring Jim Morrison of The Doors. 'This cover makes him look like some kind of cool rock god... it's horrible' said another commentary on the magazine’s Facebook feed. Why give the guy the cover of Rolling Stone? TIME gave Charles Manson the cover and all the magazines carried pictures of the Columbine shooters on the covers, too. Don't make martyrs out of these people.' Tsarnaev, who is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in Massachusetts, has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts - including the four killings - associated with the bombing . Tsarnaev has already attracted a gaggle of female supporters organized as the ‘Free Jahar’ movement who have posted comments on social media sites expressing their love for him. This isn’t the first time the magazine has featured a notorious figure on its cover, murderer Charles Mason was featured back in June 1970. The cover story itself claims to be an in-depth life and times of the bomber which Rolling Stone contributing editor Janet Reitman spent two months researching. She interviewed dozens of sources including childhood and high school friends, teachers, neighbors and law enforcement agents, many of whom spoke for the first time about the case. The magazine claims that the article reveals a lot of new information, including five revelations about Tsarnaev. As he lay in the boat, surrounded by SWAT teams and police, FBI negotiators mentioned a public plea for his surrender from his former wrestling coach. An agent on the scene later told the coach that it could have been this name from the past – and the memory of that past – both of which were invoked during the standoff, that convinced Tsarnaev to ultimately give up. Tragedy: The April 15 bombings at the Boston Marathon killed three people and wounded more than 260 . Around 2008, his older brother Tamerlan confided to his mother that he felt like 'two people' were inside him. She confided this to a close friend who felt he might need a psychiatrist, but Zubeidat believed that religion would be the cure for her son’s inner demons and growing mental instability, and pushed him deeper into Islam. Tsarnaev's high school, Cambridge Rindge and Latin, is famously diverse, but he played down the fact that he was a Muslim. As his brother and mother became more religious, he did, however, attend a small Friday prayer group that met at lunchtime, and once got quite upset when a friend who'd converted to Islam talked about it in a casual way. ‘Islam wasn't casual to Tsarnaev’ says one friend. ‘He took his religion seriously.’ Tsarnaev stands accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15 with his brother Tamerlan . Tsarnaev shared few details of his troubled home life with even his closest friends. In the months leading up to the bombing, his family had disintegrated. His parents were both living in Russia. His two older sisters were estranged. Only Tamerlan, who was becoming increasingly devout and judgmental of all non-Muslims, was still in Boston. When one of Tsarnaev’s friends asked to meet Tamerlan, but he said, ‘No, you don't want to meet him.’ Tsarnaev never spoke about 9/11. Once, though, he let slip to a high school friend that he thought the terrorist attacks could be justified, and pointed to US policies towards Muslim countries and US drone strikes and other attacks as his rationale. Tsarnaev, who is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in Massachusetts, pleaded not guilty last week to 30 counts associated with the bombing.","The Aug 3 issue of the magazine features Boston bombing suspect Tsarnaev .

More than 1,000 people gathered at an emotional memorial on Monday night to mourn the 19 elite firefighters who lost their lives battling an Arizona wildfire on Sunday. Firefighters walked down the bleachers in the gymnasium on the campus of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, their heavy work boots drumming a march on the wooden steps. They bowed their heads for moments of silence at the front of an auditorium that was so packed organizers had to send people outside for fear of violating the fire code. The burly men then hugged each other and cried at the end of the deeply emotional memorial in the Arizona mountain town of Prescott.

Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo spoke in a shaky voice at the memorial as he described throwing a picnic a month ago for the department's new recruits and meeting their families. 'About five hours ago, I met those same families at an auditorium,' he said. 'Those families lost. The Prescott Fire Department lost. The city of Prescott lost, the state of Arizona and the nation lost,' he said before receiving a standing ovation as he left the podium. For the 19 killed, violent wind gusts turned a lightning-caused forest fire into a death trap that left no escape. It was the deadliest day for fire crews since September 11, 2001.

In a desperate attempt at survival, the firefighters - members of a highly skilled Arizona-based Hotshot crew - had unfurled heat-resistant shelters and rushed to cover themselves on the ground. But the success of the shelters depends on firefighters being in a cleared area away from fuels and not in the direct path of a raging fire. Only one member of the 20-person crew survived, and that was because he was moving the unit's truck at the time. The blaze grew from 200 acres to about 2,000 in a matter of hours, and Prescott City Councilman Len Scamardo said the wind and fire made it impossible for the firefighters to flee. 'The winds were coming from the . southeast, blowing to the west, away from Yarnell and populated areas. Then the wind started to blow in, the wind kicked up to 40 to 50 mph . gusts and it blew east, south, west - every which way,' he said. 'What . limited information we have was there was a gust of wind from the north . that blew the fire backed, and trapped them.' In a heartbreaking sight, a long line . of vans from a coroner's office carried the bodies of the 19 . firefighters Monday from Yarnell to Phoenix for autopsies, as the fire . burned out of control. It . was zero percent contained by Tuesday and had burned 8,400 acres as a . heat wave across the Southwest sent temperature soaring. Authorities are investigating to figure out what exactly went wrong after the wind suddenly changed direction.

Southwest incident team leader Clay . Templin said the crew and its commanders were following safety . protocols, and it appears the fire's erratic nature simply overwhelmed . them.

Distress: The 19 men lost their lives after the fire moved quickly due to high winds and dry land . Loved: Writing on a restaurant in Prescott pays tribute to the men who lost their lives in Yarnell Hill . Yavapai County said an estimated 200 homes and other structures burned in Yarnell and hundreds of people have been evacuated due to the fire. About 200 firefighters arrived to the scorching mountains, doubling the number of firefighters battling the blaze, ignited by lightning. Many of them also were part of Hotshot crews. In addition to the flames, downed power lines and exploding propane tanks continued to threaten what was left of the town, said fire information officer Steve Skurja. A light rain fell over the area but did little in helping crews gain the upper hand fire. Arizona's governor called Sunday 'as dark a day as I can remember' and ordered flags flown at half-staff. 'I . know that it is unbearable for many of you, but it also is unbearable . for me. I know the pain that everyone is trying to overcome and deal . with today,' said Gov.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 12:08 EST, 6 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 14:12 EST, 6 January 2014 . Chelsea Clinton has her mother's ear like no other political adviser as Hillary's 'shadow campaign for a run at the presidency in 2016 was revealed today. 'Chelsea talks to Hillary about her political future more than anyone else,' a long-time Clinton insider said Monday in Washington. That 'anyone else' presumably includes Bill Clinton, the former president. 'Everyone else is just guessing at this point, but her daughter will have more influence than all the fundraisers and political operatives put together.' In a wide-ranging profile of the would-be Democratic candidate, Politico reported Sunday night that 'it would be hard to overstate the closeness between Hillary Clinton and her only child, who is known to have more of her mother’s signature caution and private approach, than her father’s more free-wheeling style.' The former first daughter, now a married 33-year-old, has her famous mother's ear at a critical time in the decision-making process . Playing it coy: ' I am very strongly exercising my prerogative as a daughter to make sure my mom has this year to rest and reflect,' Chelsea Clinton said in October . Bangs: Hillary Clinton, pictured here with husband Bill at Bill De Blasio's inauguration as New York Mayor last week, is the subject of constant speculation over her political ambitions . That closeness, it seems now, is carrying over into her mother's political decision tree. 'Hillary . Clinton has met with political professionals who want her to run, of . course,' the strategist with decades-long Clinton ties told MailOnline. 'But you can count those meetings on one hand.' 'She . talks to her daughter several times a week, and they're not just . chatting about the foundation, or when Bill and Hillary are getting a . grandchild. They're talking about the family legacy, and that includes a . 2016 White House run.' Chelsea, now 33, has become an . articulate spokeswoman for the Clinton Global Initiative, a charitable . project of the foundation that now bears her name alongside those of her . parents. As the newest family standard-bearer, she's asked often for insight into what could be a second Clinton presidency. 'Before anything else, she is my mom,' the younger Clinton said in October during Fortune magazine's 'Most Powerful Women Summit' in Washington. 'So I want her to do whatever she wants to do. … I am very strongly exercising my prerogative as a daughter to make sure my mom has this year to rest and reflect.' She was confident, she said, that her mother would 'make the right choice.' That choice is already a work in progress: One New Hampshire political reporter noted the presence of Clinton national adviser Craig Smith in the Granite State on Monday. Hillary Clinton is seeking advice from several long-time advisers, including long-time insider Huma Abedin (R) New . Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary election is often a predictor . or Democratic and Republican nominations, although Clinton herself won . that contest in 2008 and failed to close the deal. Bosom buddies: Hillary discusses more with Chelsea than just her future grandkids, an insider told MailOnline . Clinton advisers plan to visit Iowa, another bellwether primary state, later in January. The . portion of the campaigns-and-elections industry that's loyal to . Democratic Party politics has been busy recruiting Hillary to run, . according to Politico. Veteran field operatives with the Dewey Square Group, an influential Washington, D.C. public opinion consultancy, met with the potential candidate early in the summer of 2013. 'It appears to have been the only formal 2016-related presentation Clinton has been given from anyone outside her immediate circle,' Politico reported. But competing outside organizations are building a shadow campaign, partially without Clinton's input or permission. It includes a national 'Ready For Hillary' effort, which splashed a bumper-sticker campaign on Sunday with help from retired Army General Wesley Clark. 'One of the best ways to spark these conversations about Hillary potentially running in 2016 is by showing your support right now,' Clark wrote in an email to Clinton's supporters. Clinton's campaign organization, which lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama in 2008, rented its list to Ready For Hillary. Priorities USA, a pro-Obama super PAC, is another organization that is grooming itself to launch a more formal Clinton campaign the moment the formal Secretary of State gives the nod. That move won't likely come until after the 2014 midterm congressional election in November. The Clinton Foundation didn't respond to a request for a comment from Chelsea Clinton.","A long-time Clinton insider tells MailOnline that Chelsea 'will have more influence than all the fundraisers and political operatives put together'

"By . Stephen Wright . PUBLISHED: . 18:18 EST, 13 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:12 EST, 13 June 2013 . Stabbed to death: Stephen Lawrence . The two racist thugs convicted of murdering Stephen Lawrence were awarded a total of £425,000 of legal aid, official figures reveal. Gary Dobson, 37, and David Norris, 36, each received more than £200,000  of taxpayers’ money to fight their  murder charges. The amount of money claimed by the teenager’s killers emerged days after  the Government vowed to crack down on ‘fat-cat’ legal aid solicitors and barristers. After a six-month freedom of information battle with the authorities, the Mail has finally been given details of the amount of legal aid claimed by Dobson and Norris, both jailed for life in January last year after being convicted of Stephen’s 1993 murder. Our initial request in December last year was turned down by the now defunct Legal Services Commission because the pair were appealing their convictions and officials ruled that disclosing the figures could prejudice any potential retrial. But Dobson has since dropped his legal challenge and Norris’s bid to clear his name has been thrown out by the Appeal Court. The figures provided to the Mail show drug trafficker Dobson was awarded £199,109 of legal aid in the run-up to and during his murder trial, and a further £4,200 for his doomed appeal. Gangster’s son Norris received £222,346 in legal aid to defend the murder charge. Details of how much public money, if any, he received to fund his appeal have not been finalised. Their combined legal aid awards come to £425,655 and dwarf the £320,000 compensation paid to Stephen’s parents Doreen and Neville Lawrence for police bungles that hampered their quest for justice. The Crown Prosecution Service’s counsel fees for the prosecution and related hearings was £287,056. Dobson’s legal team was headed by Timothy Roberts QC, while Stephen Batten QC led Norris’s defence. After a six-week trial, an Old Bailey jury ruled in January last year that Dobson and Norris were guilty of murdering Stephen, 18, in Eltham, south-east London in April 1993. The pair, who were among a gang of five racist thugs who stabbed Stephen to death, were jailed for life. The verdicts were a victory for the Daily Mail, which since 1997 has campaigned for justice for the  Lawrence family. After their convictions, Norris launched an appeal, claiming that the use of a surveillance video in evidence was prejudicial. (Pictured left) Gary Dobson: £203,309 in aid and (pictured right) David Norris: £222,346 in aid . In the film, shot 20 months after Stephen’s murder, Norris was secretly filmed telling friends he wanted to torture and kill black people. His lawyers said the video did not prove he was involved in Stephen’s murder and should not have been admitted as evidence. The footage also showed Dobson using violent, racist language. He was seen recalling a time he threatened a black colleague with a knife. Lawyers for Norris also objected to the way prosecutors presented scientific evidence in the trial. The breakthrough in the investigation came when a cold-case team of forensic scientists were called in. They found tiny traces of blood, hair and fibres on clothing seized from the pair’s homes. The defence claimed this was the result of contamination, but that was rejected by the jury. This March, just over a month before the 20th anniversary of the murder, Dobson finally dropped the appeal against his conviction. In May, Norris lost a second attempt to challenge his conviction when he was refused permission to appeal by the Court of Appeal. Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has told the Mail he has no plans to close the investigation into Stephen’s murder, which puts pressure on the three other members of the gang that killed Stephen, brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt and their friend Luke Knight, who have not been convicted. Hopes of a breakthrough in the long-running murder probe rose in April after police said a 20th anniversary appeal for information had prompted ‘two very significant’ phone calls. Last week, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the amount paid out in legal aid was ‘unsustainable’, adding that taxpayers could not keep footing the bill for a system said to cost £2billion a year. A spokesman for the Legal Aid Agency, which replaced the LSC, said: ‘Anyone on trial for a serious criminal offence can apply for legal aid so a lawyer can represent them in court. Funding is subject to a means test which could require  the defendant to pay towards their legal costs.’","Gary Dobson, 37, and David Norris,  36, each received more than £200,000 of taxpayers’ money to fight their murder charges .

A 'devastated' Lindsey Vonn announced today that she will not be competing at February's Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia, because of a setback in her recovery from a seriously injured knee. Olympic legend Vonn, 29, underwent major surgery to repair her anterior cruciate ligaments 11 months ago - but frustratingly aggravated the same injury six weeks ago during a training session in Colorado and again in December in France. In a statement this morning, the gold medal winning downhill skier announced her decision to withdraw from the games - robbing the event of arguably its biggest star. 'I am devastated to announce that I will not be able to compete in Sochi. I did everything I possibly could to somehow get strong enough to overcome having no ACL but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level.' Scroll Down for Video: .

It's all gone downhill: Vonn has a wry smile after her crash and (right) in happier, sunnier times . 'I'm having surgery soon so that I can be ready for the World Championships at home in Vail next February. On a positive note, this means there will be an additional spot so that one of my teammates can go for gold. 'Thank you all so much for all of the love and support. I will be cheering for all of the Olympians and especially team USA!' She took home two medals from the 2010 Vancouver Games, becoming the first American woman to win an Olympic gold in the downhill. Vonn is also a four-time overall World Cup champion, the most recognized name in Alpine skiing — and, as it happens, the girlfriend of Tiger Woods. Vonn last month suffered a worrying crash in the women's World Cup downhill. In front of boyfriend Tiger Woods, she missed a gate at Val d'Isere as her troublesome right knee buckled under her and gave way. The golfer and Vonn announced they were dating in March and Vonn became a fixture at Tiger's PGA tournaments. Both have been married before. Vonn wed 2002 Olympic skier Thomas Vonn in 2007. They separated in 2011 and finalized the divorce in January - one month before Lindsey Vonn's crash. According to a statement released by her publicist, 'an MRI showed an MCL sprain, which coupled with the torn ACL, has made it impossible to stabilize her knee and be ready to safely ski again next month.' Painstaking work: Vonn vowed to return to stronger and fitter to the slopes in time for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia and is pictured here in rehab following her career threatening injury in March 2013 .

'Vonn will have surgery shortly and is expected to make a full recovery in time for the 2014/15 World Cup season and the 2015 World Alpine Ski Championships in Vail-Beaver Creek,' the statement from her publicist concluded and other's from the world of skiing chimed in with their support. 'In looking ahead, I have every ounce of confidence that Lindsey will be in the starting gate next World Cup season ready to compete,"" said Bill Marolt, president of the U.S. Skiing and Snowboard Association according to USA Today. 'She knows the hard work it takes to get to the top and still has significant goals to achieve in what has been an incredible career.' Victor: Lindsey Vonn, the Olympic downhill ski champion, has injured her right knee again. She hoped to improve on her 2010 Olympic performance, pictured, in which she won a gold medal and bronze . The loss of Vonn to injury will also prove a huge disappointment to the corporate backers of these controversial games. NBC has been heavily promoting the games with Vonn as the American face and is heavily sponsored by Red Bull, Rolex and Oakley - among others. Her return to Olympic competition was expected to culminate in one of the stories of the games - with a win for Vonn the ultimate comeback tale. 'While Lindsey won't be in Sochi, we have a strong team that is well prepared to challenge,' Marolt said. 'The women's speed team is experienced with five athletes who have achieved World Cup podiums and a seasoned veteran in Julia Mancuso, who has won three Olympic medals in her career.

Bygone beauty queen Carmen Lechin is set for a federal court trial later this month after allegedly being intoxicated on an international flight and assaulting a male flight attendant, forcing the pilot to turn the plane around. The 48-year-old former Miss Venezuela was indicted by a federal grand jury in Houston on charges of interfering with a flight crew attendent, stemming from an incident on a United flight from Houston to Bogota on June 6, according to Vail Daily. Lechin - who was on probation at the time from previous charges of eluding a police officer, harassment, driving under the influence and domestic violence - is accused of kicking and screaming so much during the flight the crew determined her too volatile to complete the trip. Carmen Lechin, a former Miss Venezuela beauty queen, faces federal charges after she allegedly got drunk on an international flight, assaulted a male flight attendant and the crew had to turn the plane around and go home . Flashback: In 1984, Carmen Lechin won the Miss Venezuela title and went on to compete in the Miss Universe pageant of that year, placing second runner-up. She is now facing federal charges . Carmen Lechin, who will face a federal court on January 27 for causing a disturbance on an international flight, is seen here during the swimsuit competition of the Miss Universe 1984 pageant in Miami . According to the federal indictment, Lechin 'knowingly and unlawfully intimidated flight attendant Samuel Oliver by creating a disturbance in flight through her abusive language, assaultive behavior and her refusal to comply with directions, instructions and warnings'. She was allegedly intoxicated at the time and FBI agents were called out to meet the plane as it touched back down in Houston. The next day, June 7, Lechin’s Texas probation officer filed a complaint alleging she had violated her probation, citing the federal charges and her drinking. Terms of Lechin’s probation prohibited her using alcohol and drugs and stipulated she have no new violations of law. Her trial is set for January 27 in Houston. Once it is complete, Lechin - who was runner up at the Miss Universe pageant in 1984 - will be forced to face her probation violations. She was sentenced to two years probation after an incident on Christmas Eve 2011 in Eagle County, Colorado, where she lived before moving to Houston. Old footage shows Carmen Lechin winning the Miss Venezuela crown in 1984. Lechin, now 48, has been charged with a string of crimes, most of them alcohol-fueled . According to Vail Daily, Eagle County sheriff’s deputies were summoned to a Beaver Creek condo by Carmen Lechin’s husband, Alex, who said she smacked him in the head. She was already free on bond for a similar incident on Thanksgiving 2011, and her Christmas Eve drinking ran counter to the conditions of her bond, the police report said. She got into in a blue Hummer H3 while intoxicated and drove up Interstate 70. Lechin then called her husband's cell phone while deputies were speaking to him. Alex Lechin pleaded with his wife to return to the condo and speak to the sheriff's deputies, the report says. When they got on the phone, Lechin screamed she was not stupid, 'because she knows that she is just going to jail if she stops,' she reportedly said. The blue Hummer was then found driving on I-70. When Lechin didn't respond to the lights and sirens, refusing to stop, a chase ensued.

The California retreat where Frank Sinatra married his fourth wife and where guests, from the Queen of England to Clark Gable, have vacationed, is to host President Obama and the China's leader. Sunnylands, a sprawling 200-acre pink-roofed estate in Rancho Mirage, will be the setting for a critical meeting as President Obama discusses cyber crime and North Korea with President Xi Jinping. Built in 1966 by billionaire Walter Annenberg and his wife Leonora, the Sunnylands estate includes a 20,000 square foot main house, three cottages and a nine-hole golf course. Scroll down for video . Desert retreat: Sunnylands in California was designed to reflect the pink hues of the sunset over the mountains . It is best known for its pink roof complete with pyramid, requested by Mrs Annenberg who wanted 'to match the sunset glow on nearby foothills'. The Annenbergs liked the color of the roof so much that they used the same stone for the burial chamber where they were laid to rest, according to NBC News. When the billionaire couple decided to build their country estate, they turned to A Quincy Jones, said to be the only true modernist architect in the U.S. The long-time dean of the University of Southern California's School of Architecture, was renowned for his statement roofs and ability to blend modern architecture into landscapes. At Sunnylands he added walls of glass to make the most of the natural light, overhangs to provide shade from the desert sun and Mexican stone lava walls. 'Traditionally, great estates have been built in historic styles,' Los Angeles architect Frederick Fisher said. 'So it was a bold move on the part of the Annenbergs to bring in a modernist architect to design Sunnylands, one of the great and arguably the only purely modernist estate in the United States.' Oasis: The Annenberg's winter home has beautiful landscaped gardens planted with native California plants . Modern: Architect A Quincy Jones designed the main house and guest cottages, using walls of glass . Tranquil: Guests meandering in the gardens can rest by reflection pools or visit the cacti gardens . Jones's ultra-modern design was offset by . Mrs Annenberg, who introduced a rose and cactus garden and Hollywood . Regency style interiors. She employed William Haines and Ted Graber, who had refurbished the White House under the Reagan administration, to work on the inside of their home. Yellow and pink marble was used for the main house floors and guest wings, and small groups of low sofas and tables were added to encourage a relaxed atmosphere. The couple's collection of works by Picasso and Van Gogh hung on the lava stone walls. After their death, the collection was donated to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Prints of the originals now hang in their place. A Rodin statue of Eve still remains in the atrium however. Relax: Guests can follow the garden paths to shaded seating areas dotted around the estate . Creative: Cloisonne cranes, which make up part of the Annenberg art collection, are still displayed at the estate . For all its grandeur, Sunnylands was the Annenbergs' home for at least five months of the year, from 1966 to 2009. When the Queen of England stayed with them in 1983, Mr Annenberg told her she would 'see how ordinary Americans live'. Mrs Annenberg always went out of her way to make her guests feel comfortable, ensuring magazines to suit their individual interests were left out for them, and that color-coordinated jelly beans were put in the guest bedrooms, which were decorated in either yellow or pink. The procession of famous guests to Sunnylands, including seven Presidents, Fred Astaire and Sammy Davis Jr, would join the Annenbergs in watching movies on a large screen, for lunch by the pool or a simple game of the couple's favorite pastime, Backgammon. When the couple died, their generosity and love for Sunnylands led them to turn the estate over to the public. After a $60.5 million renovation last year, the estate opened to visitors for four days a week - as long as world leaders aren't using it. The couple's love of art was reflected in the garden, which was designed to look like Van Gogh's 1889 painting, Olive Trees. Landscape architect James Burnett was commissioned to transform nine acres of desert scrub into a masterpiece of color that would constantly change with the seasons. Graceful: Rodin's sculpture of Eve in the atrium. Most of the couple's art collection is now in the Met . Expansive: An aerial view of Sunnylands, designed to be a West Coast version of Camp David . Serene: The modern house sits in 200 acres of landscaped gardens in the Californian desert . Visitors can meander along one and a half miles of path, which take in the vibrant native desert plants and reflection pools, as the 10,000 San Jacinto mountain looms in the distance. 'We like desert plants for their beauty, sculptural habits, and color,' Burnett had said. His choice was also an environmentally friendly one. Despite the expansive, colorful garden, it uses only 20 per cent of the water allotted to the resort's grounds. The gardens have become a haven for wildlife, with cotton tails, jack rabbits, iguanas and monarch butterflies regularly spotted. With its peaceful surroundings, and luxuriant interiors, Sunnylands has often been described as an escape from the real world. Treated like royalty: Lenora and Walter Annenberg welcome the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh in 1983 . Welcoming: The Annenbergs greet President Reagan and his wife Nancy to Sunnylands in 1981 . This was certainly the case for Richard Nixon, who stayed there after his resignation as President in 1974. After his visit, he wrote: 'When you're down, you find out who your real friends are,' according to NPR. The . estate's nine-hole golf course, designed by Dick Wilson in 1964, and . opened for rounds before the house was completed, was popular with . President Eisenhower, who was the first president to play a round on it. The Annenbergs had wanted their beloved Sunnylands home to continue to be used like a West Coast version of Camp David. This . weekend is the first time world leaders will use it since Mrs Annenberg . died in 2009. The estate is run as a non-profit organization made up . of the couple's children and grandchildren. When . President Obama arrives for talks this weekend, he will use the 17,000 . square foot purpose built building commissioned by Mrs Annenberg to be . used for retreats. The . building, which was finished in 2011, should feel like home for the .

During the crucial meetings with the Chinese leader, President Obama is expected to tackle China's alleged cyber attacks to try to steal information from the U.S. government and private sector. 'We expect this to become a standing issue in the U.S.-China relationship, given the importance of cyber security to the global economy,' a senior administration official told ABC News. The superpower leaders are also due to discuss economic co-operation, human rights abuses, and North Korea.","200-acre Rancho Mirage estate designed by modernist Quincy Jones .

When Ann and Mark Kennedy decided to give their pink cottage a lick of paint, they didn’t anticipate it would leave council officials seeing red. The couple have been threatened with court action and told they should have got planning permission before painting the Grade II-listed building. But they insist the 17th century cottage in Kennford, Devon, is the same colour as when they bought it 12 years ago. Scroll down for video . Upset: Ann Kennedy in front of her listed cottage in Devon, which the local council say is too pink . Any different? Ann's daughter Hollie stands in front of the cottage 12 years ago, when the family moved in. They claim it looks no different today . Mrs Kennedy said: ‘Other residents . around us all had their paintwork done and it made ours look shabby. 'So . we spent nearly £1,000 renewing ours in the same colour, pink. Before . the paint had even dried we had someone from the council come round.’ The retired dance teacher added that . the council had received only one complaint – from a neighbour who did . not overlook the property. The couple say that  Teignbridge District Council in Devon have threatened legal action after a single complaint about the shade of paint used on Lantern Cottage, which they say should be lighter. Pink is a common colour on houses of this age and type all over the UK. Particulars: The Kennedys are using the details of their 2001 purchase as evidence to back their claims it looks no different . Mrs Kennedy added: 'I have pictures of the cottage painted in pink when we moved in and on the estate agent's details. 'Just one person has complained. He does not live within viewing distance of the house and has to physically walk around just to see it. 'Then I received a letter from Teignbridge Council saying I had to apply for planning permission. 'I have now put in planning permission for pink. It is certainly not a shocking pink, it is a bit lighter than before. I am devastated and heartbroken by what has happened,' said the retired dance teacher. The council has the power to make them paint it again if they are still unhappy, which could be another shade of pink. The Kennedy family say the three bedroom cottage was pink when they bought it for £130,000 12 years ago and took photos of it at the time which prove it is still the same colour. They have received backing from local Lib Dem councillor Alan Connett, who has intervened on their behalf. 'I think the council is demonstrating the worst of being a Jobsworth,' he said. 'Mrs Kennedy is being put through the bureaucratic mangle because she painted her cottage the same colour. 'Teignbridge Council had just one complaint and the parish council raised no objection at all. 'Council officers could be spending their time chasing really serious planning breaches and protecting listed buildings in real danger.' Traditional: Ann's Lantern Cottage is a pink traditionally used on homes of a similar age all over the UK . Argument: Ann Kennedy and her husband Mark say their Grade II listed home has not changed at all . Row: There has been one complaint about the colour of the house is Kennford, Devon (pictured), and the council has taken that on towards court . But council bosses say they are following a standard procedure. A Teignbridge District Council spokeswoman said: 'In November 2011 we received a formal complaint regarding the colour of the Grade II listed cottage in Kennford. Our planning and conservation officers visited and carried out a site inspection. 'We advised the owner that Listed Building Consent (LBC) was required. This is needed before any alterations are made to listed buildings that affect its character or appearance. We also advised that enforcement action could be taken if an application was not received of the alteration was not reversed. 'A retrospective LBC application was lodged on April 23. The application will now go through the usual planning procedures and will be open to comments from everyone, including people living nearby, statutory consultees and anyone else who may wish to put forward a view. A decision is due to be made in June.'","Owners say that the shade of pink used is exactly the same as before .

Meet the world's first baby bought with Bitcoins after the fertility treatments which led to her conception were paid for with the cult digital currency. That's according to Dr C. Terence Lee, a California fertility specialist, who helped the child's parents pay for fertility treatments using Bitcoins. The OB/GYN doctor, an Bitcoin enthusiast, is trying to encourage more patients to pay for his services using the currency. Scroll down for video . Welcome to a new world: The first Bitcoin baby was born in California after the child's parents paid for fertility treatments using the digital currency . The doctor appears to be one of the first to accept Bitcoins for medical services at his office in Brea. Dr Lee enthused about his love of the currency during a talk at the Bitcoin 2013 conference in San Jose on May 17. He told CNN Money: 'I thought it was interesting - people . supporting it as a way for the common man to take back hold of finance. 'I was like, ''OK, let me support . them.'' And then I became part of them.' After convincing a male patient to take the payment of 15 Bitcoins - worth $5 each at the time - for a sperm test, Dr Lee set his sights higher. He asked several patients if they would . consider using Bitcoins as a method of payment for their treatment as it . offered a large discount. Ready money: Bitcoins have been made but in reality, the currency is piece of computer code which can't be stolen or forged . It's a piece of data locked in an internet-based network by a complex equation. Once released it can be traded and used like money online and can be purchased with real cash. Many websites are now taking Bitcoins as a form of currency. As well as digital currency, Bitcoin miners enjoy the competitive nature of unlocking the coins. Famous fans include the Winklevoss twins who own around 1 per cent of Bitcoins - currently worth around $11million. It has been dismissed by some as a Ponzi Scheme and touted by others as the future of money. It is not centrally controlled and it's unique and complex set up means the market cannot be altered or hacked, according to the developers. There are 21 million coins predicted to last until 2140 and their finite nature means they perform more like a commodity, such as gold. The coins first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. They were introduced by an obscure hacker whose identity is a mystery but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, which is thought to be a pseudonym. Users choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users.Bitcoins can be bought from specialist currency exchanges and online marketplaces such as eBay. The doctor's breakthrough came after a couple whom he had helped have three children came back wanting to have a fourth baby. Despite not understanding how the currency actually worked, the couple agreed - after the doctor offered half-price treatment -  and medical history was made. The transaction proved to be a little complicated. The couple owed $1,000 - a large sum for the Bitcoin market. Dr Lee decided to use an exchange service in Australia which has since gone out of business. The parents-to-be set up an account with . CryptoXChange using an international money transfer from their U.S. bank. After a few days, the transaction was complete and Dr Lee had his Bitcoins. The value of the currency has leapt - meaning he made $2,600 from the transaction. Bitcoins have become an increasingly popular digital currency since they emerged in 2008. They are bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of any central control. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss - the twin brothers famous for a legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook after they claimed he stole their idea - are forerunners in the Bitcoin phenomenon. Their savvy move to buy 1 per cent of Bitcoins has made them a tidy profit of $11million. While Bitcoins were first introduced four years ago and were initially unknown to everyone but hackers and the computer-savvy, they soon caught the eye of investors. Although the cybercurrency has existed for years as a kind of Internet oddity, a perfect storm of developments have brought it to the cusp of mainstream use. Big fan: Fertility specialist Dr C Terence Lee has been trying to encourage patients to pay for treatments using Bitcoin . As currency crises in Europe piqued . investors' interest, a growing number of businesses announced they were . accepting Bitcoins for an ever-wider range of goods and services. The value of a single Bitcoin began racing upward amid growing media . attention, smashing past the $100 mark back in April before more than . doubling again a few days later. However the price of Bitcoin quickly imploded, falling from around . $266 on April 10 to just above $40 in 24 hours, according to . Bitcoincharts.com, which tracks trades across the Internet. Dismissed by some as a Ponzi Scheme and touted by others as the future . of money, the plunge in value gave weight to a chorus of detractors claiming it . is no more than a speculative bubble. Users can send money directly from their computers to others on the . other side of the world, and coins can be used to buy real goods, . swapped for cash on exchanges or used for speculation.","Dr C.

Callous: Donovan Clough was jailed for 4 years for fleecing pensioners out of thousands for work that was not needed on there homes . A cowboy builder has been jailed for four years for urinating in lofts and putting dead birds into roofs to con vulnerable pensioners into paying 'obscene' amounts for unneeded home repairs. Donovan Ross Morley-Clough, 22, used a string of 'disgraceful ploys' to fleece a dementia sufferer and other elderly people out of thousands of pounds. He claimed he was a Christian who worked with the Age UK charity while targeting men and women in their 70s and 80s by cold-calling at their homes and convincing them they needed house repairs, York Crown Court was told. Many of his victims were disabled, included dementia sufferer Joyce Lister, a frail 87-year-old who has since died, it was said. Morley-Clough also preyed on another dementia sufferer and a pensioner with Parkinson's disease who were among his victims. Prosecutor Georgina Coade told the court Morley-Clough would talk his way into victims’ homes, often telling them he had seen a bird fly into the roof. He would offer to retrieve it and get into their lofts before inventing a catalogue of false problems including urinating in lofts to present the homeowner with wet insulation, dipping roofing material in water tanks and presenting it as evidence of leaks or damp, and removing slates so water could drip through ceilings. He also brought dead birds into houses and claimed they had been nesting in the roofs and even built a nest out of a hay bale and placed it on a roof top himself. Victims were quoted 'obscene' prices and he reduced perfectly good roofs to ones needing thousands of pounds of repairs. In one case he drove an 84-year-old woman to her bank so she could withdraw £2,000. He is known to have taken over £15,000 from his victims, but paperwork seized by trading standards officers shows that over he tried to get £44,000 but some of his targets got suspicious. Miss Coade said Clough claimed to be qualified and a Christian affiliated to Age UK. But the college drop-out had only completed seven and a half months of a bricklaying course and the only bona fide business he had run was washing car windows. 'The reality is he is a conman who based his entire business on deceiving vulnerable people,' she said. 'He would grossly over charge for any work he did do and any work done was of terrible standard. 'Frequently, he would leave their homes in a worse state than they had been in before so remedial works would be needed.' Disgrace: Morley-Clough urinated in lofts and hid dead birds in roofs to convince vulnerable pensioners to part with thousands of pounds for unnecessary repairs, York Crown Court, pictured, heard . Morley-Clough, 22, of Riccall, North Yorkshire, admitted 14 counts of engaging in a commercial practice in an unprofessional manner, two of participating in a fraudulent business and two of fraud by false representation - all relating to bogus roofing work committed over 14 months in the York, Wetherby and Selby areas between December 2011 and February this year. Andrew Semple, mitigating, said his client suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had a history of suicidal behaviour. He had even written a letter to the court claiming he regards himself as a 'victim'. Passing sentence, The Recorder of York Judge Stephen Ashurst, said: 'There were a number of frankly disgraceful ploys used by you to persuade these people to part with their money. 'You were very persistent - going back time and time again to put customers under pressure. Some were driven to their banks to withdraw money because for obvious reasons you preferred cash. 'The elderly brood on these incidents. They feel a fool and can’t understand why they were taken in. 'In this case it is easy to see why. You had the gift of the gab, saying you were a Christian doing them a good turn. 'You are a complete hypocrite. 'Decent members of the community treat the elderly and vulnerable with respect and understanding, but by your conduct you have shown in this case you saw such people as easy targets for fraud.' Clough was also given an ASBO banning him from trading or advertising as a roofer for ten years. Two of Donovan Clough’s victims have died since proceedings began. Sergeant Amanda Reader, of North Yorkshire Police, said after the case concluded yesterday: 'Clough is a convincing and cunning conman, who chose to target elderly and vulnerable victims. 'They were tricked into paying extortionate amounts of money for work that was actually substandard to that which should have been expected.'","Donovan Morley-Clough targeted pensioners, including dementia sufferers .

Formula One legend Michael Schumacher made a will to distribute his £750 million cash, cars and property empire among his wife and two children just three years before the ski accident which has brought him to the brink of death. Back in 2010 he admitted that he had made a will for the first time, telling a German magazine: 'Yes, I have made my testament because I am a family man. 'But it is less about Formula One but because of the things that can happen in everyday life.' Scroll down for video . Premonition: Former Formula One driver Michael Schumacher, pictured skiing in the northern Italy in 2005, made a will after a premonition about what could happen in 'everyday life' Dangers: Seven time F1 champion Michael Schumacher was more concerned about possible mishaps off the track than dangers on the circuit, he told an interview in 2010 . That premonition of 'everyday life' came sadly true on December 29 last year when he smashed his head on to a rock while skiing at the French resort of Meribel. The 45-year-old is still in an artificial coma at a hospital in Grenoble where he remains stable but seriously ill. Medics said today they have noted a ‘slight improvement’ in his health. The will, he said, 'covers all those who are important to me.' On Sunday his father Rold and brother Ralf were among the close family visitors at his bedside in Grenoble's University Hospital. Concern: Michael Schumacher's wife, Corinna, arrives at the Grenoble hospital where her husband is being treated after sustaining a head injury during a ski accident in French Alps . Vigil: Michael Schumacher's father Rolf, left, and brother Ralf arrive at Grenoble Hospital, French Alps, on Sunday where the former seven-time Formula One champion is being treated after sustaining a head injury . German media reported that a brain scan on Friday troubled his medical team but he had a quiet weekend. Today doctors confirmed Schumacher was still in a 'critical' condition. 'The clinical state of Michael Schumacher is considered as stable and is being constantly monitored as he receives medical treatment,' a statement from Grenoble's University Hospital said. 'However, the medical team in charge of his care underlines that they continue to consider Michael's condition as critical.' Speculation is mounting that French prosecutors may be preparing charges against the operators of the piste where Schumacher crashed. Prosecution: French prosecutors may be preparing to charge the operators of the ski area in Meribel where Michael Schumacher was seriously injured, pictured, after hitting his head on a rock . A press conference will be held on . Wednesday at 10am (GMT) in the Alpine town of Albertville, local . prosecutor Patrick Quincy said. Attorney Maurice Bodecher -  a specialist in the field of ski and criminal law and formerly Chief Judge of the French of Ski Federation until 2010 - has been retained by the piste management. If any charges are laid they could pave the way for a multi-million pound lawsuit from the Schumacher family. The main question, according to German media, is whether the scene of the accident - full of rocks of the type that Schumacher collided with - was properly marked. The new focus of the investigation comes as more evidence emerges to suggest speed was not a primary factor in the accident. A German man, who was filming his girlfriend in the ski resort of Meribel, has come forward to say he inadvertently filmed Schumacher's crash on the slopes - and the footage shows the motoracing star was travelling at little more than 12mph. Michael Schumacher was travelling at 12mph when he crashed, a witness claimed . Detectives in France were last night trying to get a copy of the smartphone video after the man, who has not been named, went to German news journal Der Spiegel. Formula One legend Schumacher, who is still in a critical condition in an induced coma, was apparently skiing at just 12mph when he hit a rock under the snow. Der Spiegel said: ‘The man, a 35-year-old flight attendant from Essen, was just a few metres from the accident site on the slopes and was filming his girlfriend. ‘In the background of the film, slightly blurred, a skier can be seen in the unprepared part between the two slopes sliding over the snow. ‘According to the man, who contacted Der Spiegel on Friday, the skier was Schumacher. He is believed to have slowed down to a speed of up to 20kph.’ Police will tomorrow check footage from a tiny digital camera Schumacher wore on his helmet, after his family handed it over. The statement corroborates claims made by Schumacher’s spokeswoman Sabine Kehm. Earlier this week she denied Schumacher had been speeding after allegations were made that he was doing at least 60km/h. She said: 'I think after having spoken with several people who have been with Michael at this moment, Michael and the group have been skiing on slopes that were normal slopes. 'Then there is a blue slope and a red slope, and in between there was a part which was deep snow, and Michael went into that.'","Ex-F1 champion worried about 'things that can happen in everyday life'

But – obsessed with her weight – Sarah Houston, 23, was secretly taking a banned and dangerous slimming pill. And just when she told her psychiatrist her bulimia was finally under control, the drug, which is linked to 62 deaths worldwide, claimed her life too. Although banned for human consumption, DNP is easily available online – in capsule form – because it is also a pesticide. Sarah Houston, 23, had complained of feeling hot and unwell and had been breathing heavily on the evening of her death . At her inquest yesterday, coroner David Hinchliff said it was ‘entirely’ responsible for Miss Houston’s death. Demanding a crackdown on the sale of the capsules, he said manufacturers knew they were bought for weight control. ‘The only motive for manufacturing a . toxic substance as a slimming aid would be to profit from people who . have the misfortune of having a condition such as Sarah’s,’ he said. ‘Anyone who professionally . manufactures capsules to be taken as a drug has the intention of people . using it as a drug. Sarah’s death is a consequence of that.’ DNP is sold as a weight loss aid, but has been described as 'extremely dangerous to human health' by doctors. It is sold mostly over the internet under a number of different names but contains 2, 4-Dinitrophenol. It is marketed mainly to bodybuilders as a weight loss aid as it is thought to dramatically boost metabolism. The manufactured drug is yellow and odourless and was previously used as a herbicide and fungicide. It was launched as a slimming aid in the U.S. in the 1930s but then banned in 1938, due to the severe side-effects. Depending on the amount consumed, signs of acute poisoning could include nausea, vomiting, restlessness, flushed skin, sweating, dizziness, headaches, rapid respiration and irregular heart-beat, possibly leading to coma and death. Miss Houston had taken DNP along with . a prescription anti-depressant. The combination of the two drugs, which . both boost the metabolism, may have proved fatal, the inquest heard. She was found dead in her bedroom by a . flatmate the day after refusing to call an ambulance when she felt hot . and unwell. Her family, who are all qualified doctors, pledged to lobby . the Government to make DNP illegal. Her father Geoff, 55, said: ‘For those who are selling it, if you have any ounce of decency you must stop. ‘The world has lost a bright, bubbly . person who would have gone on to making people’s lives better. Sarah . loved life and was passionate about helping others less fortunate than . herself.’ Investigations after her death last . September indicated Miss Houston had taken 38 capsules from a packet of . 100 of Dinitrophenol (DNP) and the drug was detected in her blood. There was no evidence of an overdose and she was not suicidal, the hearing at Wakefield was told. She had been seeing a psychiatrist . for her eating disorder for three years and had improved so much that . the sessions were expected to come to an end soon and she was no longer . officially bulimic. The evening before she died Miss . Houston, a student at the University of Leeds, was breathing heavily, . had yellow eyes and had two cold showers to try and cool herself down . after complaining of feeling unwell. She was encouraged to call an . ambulance by her flatmate, but insisted the symptoms would pass and it . wasn’t unusual for her to feel like that. Miss Houston texted a friend the next . day but was found later by another flatmate and paramedics called to . the address in Leeds pronounced her dead at 5.15pm. Toxicologist Matthew Wade said of . DNP: ‘Because it is a banned substance, we don’t really know what would . be a safe level to have in the body. 'The drug affects different people in different ways. ‘We have heard of several deaths . caused by DNP and we know that whatever the dose, it can be . life-threatening. It is not intended for human consumption and it is a . poisonous substance. It therefore seems likely DNP consumption caused . Sarah’s death.’ Dr Graham Mould, a forensic . toxicologist, said taking DNP with the anti-depressant Fluoxetine – also . known by the trade name Prozac – may have proved fatal as the effects . could have been ‘exacerbated’. He said: ‘We don’t know how long . Sarah had been taking DNP but it may have accumulated in her system. It . increases the body’s metabolic rate. The side effects can be overheating . and breathlessness caused by an increased heart rate and this seems to . be consistent with how Sarah was feeling that evening. 'Body Image Distortion': Sarah had been battling bulimia but was responding well to medical treatment . Sarah 'unfairly compared self' to other people but psychiatrist of three years said her state of mind 'had improved significantly' Geoff and Gina Houston, the parents of Sarah Houston, outside Wakefield Coroner's Court yesterday . ‘At a very high dose Fluoxetine can . have a similar effect to DNP and so one can speculate that the two drugs . together might have speeded up the effect.’ Psychiatrist Dr John Morgan said Miss . Houston made no secret of her bulimia: ‘Her drive to lose weight was . always there and she was fearful of weight gain.’ ‘She was most likely taking DNP to . satisfy her own need to control her weight,’ he said. ‘Sarah was a . healthy weight, with a body mass index of 23, and no one knew she had . been taking the drug alongside her prescribed anti-depressants.’ The medical student had previously . been ‘bingeing’ twice daily and ‘purging’ eight times a day, but this . was reduced to an average of once a fortnight. ‘She felt like she had . the knowledge to combat her eating disorder,’ he added. Miss Houston’s father, mother Gina, 55, sister Vicky, 27, and brother James, 29, are all doctors from Chesham Bois, Bucks. Selena Walrond, 26, (left) died from a heart attack in 2008 after taking . a large amount of DNP (right) that she had bought online. Sean Cleathero, 28, (right) is believed to have taken DNP after acquiring it at a local gym. He died shortly afterwards last October . The family said after the hearing . they wanted to make people aware of the drug’s dangers ‘so no other . family suffer in this way’. They said in a statement: ‘It seems . incomprehensible to us that such a toxic substance can be available in . tablet form to be sold in the UK for human consumption across the . internet. ‘It is perhaps only through her death that the strongest message can come out. ‘If anything can be learnt from Sarah’s death then that might help little bit in alleviating her loss.’ Police believe the capsules were imported from Spain. Detective Constable Kate Lonsdale . said: ‘The website does flag up that the product is not for human . consumption but by selling it in tablet form, they are knowing full well . that it is going to be used for weight loss. ‘It will be difficult to ban it . outright because it is still legitimately used as an effective . pesticide. The way to control consumption is through education.’ Recording a verdict of misadventure, . Mr Hinchliff said he hoped there would be a ‘campaign’ to get substances . such as DNP controlled by law. He said he did not believe Miss Houston . intended to harm herself.","Sarah Houston took DNP, an industrial chemical popular with bodybuilders .

Research has found there are striking similarities between what happens in the brain during a migraine and the way skin reacts to having chilli oil rubbed into it. Now, scientists are using the way the body deals with chilli to develop migraine drugs. Research has found there are striking similarities between what happens in the brain during a migraine and the way skin reacts to having chilli oil rubbed into it . They found that when chilli oil touches the skin, the capsaicin in the . pepper causes the body to release calcitonin gene-related peptides, or CGRP, leading to an increase in blood flow to the affected area. Biotechnology companies . are now targeting a chemical released during a migraine that carries a 'pain' signal from nerve to nerve. By blocking a nerve receptor from receiving . the message, these companies hope to develop drugs that prevent debilitating attacks. One company developing a migraine drug is Amgen. To test the chilli theory, researchers injected the proposed drug under the skin . of patients who had chilli oil on their skin. The drug blocked the . CGRP that causes increased blood flow. Biotechnology companies are now targeting a chemical released during a migraine that carries a 'pain' signal from nerve to nerve . One theory is that migraines are caused by enlarged blood vessels. And by blocking a receptor in the brain from . receiving the message, migraines could be avoided completely, Peter . Goadsby, director of the University of California, San Franciscoâ€™s . Headache Centre, told Bloomberg. 'What these antibody approaches hope to do is to either block the receptor or mop up the CGRP itself,' he said. Despite being such a common problem, no drugs have been 'developed specifically for the treatment of migraines', Rob . Lenz, who is leading the migraine drug development for pharmaceutical company Amgen. 'They were developed as anti-epileptics, or blood pressure lowering agent,' he told the website. Currently, the most widely used medication for migraines is triptans, which constrict blood vessels . in the brain to relieve swelling and pain. But these are only taken once migraines are in full swing. Botox is also approved as a preventative treatment for migraines, though only for severe sufferers. It is thought the new type of drug being developed would be for people who suffer migraines less often.","There are similarities between what happens to brain during a migraine and how skin reacts to chilli oil .

David Cameron denied yesterday that his wife has influenced his policy towards intervention in Syria, as he gave his gloomiest assessment yet of efforts to end the conflict. Government figures said last week that Samantha Cameron – who visited a refugee camp in the region earlier this year – was pushing the Prime Minister to take further action there. Mr Cameron said his wife had been ‘very moved’ by her visit to Lebanon in March, where half a million Syrians have fled. But he insisted it was a ‘total urban myth’ that UK policy was affected by her experiences there on a humanitarian mission with the Save The Children charity. During her visit, Samantha Cameron met a ten-year-old girl whose mother was killed when a shell destroyed the family home, and a mother of six whose son was shot by a sniper. She said at the time: ‘No child should experience what they have. ‘With every day that passes, more children and parents are being killed, more innocent childhoods are smashed to pieces.’ The Prime Minister said Syria, which plunged into civil war more than two years ago, was ‘on a depressing trajectory’ and President Bashar Al Assad is ‘stronger than he was a few months ago’. Efforts to oust the ‘evil’ Syrian dictator appear to have reached a stalemate, he told BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Britain has sent help to the Free Syrian Army, including communications equipment, but has not taken a decision on sending weapons amid growing fears over some of the rebels’ Al Qaeda links.

Mr Cameron said it was right to continue to support the opposition. ‘You do have problems with part of the opposition which is extreme, that we should have nothing to do with,’ he said. ‘But that is not a reason for pulling up the drawbridge, putting our head in the sand and doing nothing’. The Prime Minister said his wife was ‘very moved by what she saw because you hear from people – and I’ve done this – you hear from people who are fleeing an appalling regime that is murdering their husbands, wives, children, wrecking their communities.’ But Mr Cameron said: ‘She does not influence my policy on this.

When someone overweight claims to eat healthily and exercise but sill can't shift the pounds, it can be difficult to believe them. But that is just the situation Londoner Sidone Price found herself in after doctors said her almost permanent bloating and excessive weight was down to IBS. Fortunately Sidoine did not give up the fight to find a diagnosis and, on a colleague's advice, sought a food intolerance test - and found the real reason behind her size. Airport Lounge Manager Sidone, 26, says: 'I had always been quite curvy, but over the last few years I had noticed my weight just kept creeping up, so I decided to do something about it.' She started eating much healthier, sticking . to five small meals a day with a mixture of lean protein and lots of . vegetables and salads. But Sidone struggled to shift much of her uncomfortable 14st weight. Doctors said Sidoine's incessant bloating and excessive weight was down to IBS . 'I also joined a gym and started working out three times a week. I noticed that some of the weight came off, but it just seemed really slow and I wasn't seeing the results I was expecting considering how healthily I was eating and how much effort I was putting in at the gym. 'I was also constantly bloated every time I'd eat which was causing me a lot of pain and discomfort, not to mention left me feeling I felt embarrassed. 'Months of healthy eating and exercise . were proving to have little effect, especially on my stomach area which . remained stubbornly bloated. 'I became quite anxious about the situation and so I went to see my GP. He wasn't very helpful and just told me to carry on as I was, telling me that the bloating was probably just IBS and that the weight would fall off eventually. 'In desperation I tried a radical . diet that involved eating mainly raw carrots and houmous at lunch, but again this proved to have little effect. 'It . was then that a colleague suggested that I might have a food . intolerance and recommended that I try a food intolerance test. Sidoine was able to shed those stubborn excess pounds she'd been trying so hard to get rid of . 'When the results came back they revealed that I had intolerances to a number of the 'healthy' foods I'd been munching for the past few months - including carrots!' 'Cutting these from my diet had an almost instantaneous effect. Within days my stomach was noticeably flatter and my IBS symptoms had greatly reduced.' 'As well as carrots, I also found out . that I am intolerant to cow's milk and yeast. I have cut these . completely from my diet. Three months later I am still sticking to my . new diet. The YorkTest intolerance test made Sidone change her eating habits immediately and while she carries on with her healthy diet from before, she has had to find alternatives to her reactive foods:  carrots, cow's milk and yeast. 'I . eat quite a lot of stir-fried vegetables as I find just boiled veg can . be quite dull. Where before I'd always throw in some carrots, now I've . replaced this with other veg such as courgettes. 'As I've completely . cut out cow's milk, I now use almond and soya milk for smoothies and . soups. 'Wine contains yeast so I have also replaced my usual white wine for spirits. I'll go for a G&T now instead of a glass of wine. 'I also steer clear of using dressings and sauces because they can contain yeast too. I've stopped using soya sauce when I make stir-fry as I've struggled to find a yeast-free version.' In the months that followed Sidoine was able to shed the stubborn excess pounds she had been trying so hard to get rid of. 'I don't yet have a boyfriend but I am . dating. I didn't feel confident about dating before but I do much more . now. Also I'm much more confident on . holiday and in summer clothes - I can finally enjoy clothes shopping now whereas . before I would avoid it,' she said. She . now weighs in at a svelte 9st 7lbs, losing well over 4st, and wears a size 12 - three sizes down from her peak at size 18. 'It feels like my entire life has changed', she says. 'I wouldn't go back to my old diet and I'll make sure I never have trigger . foods again... I've gone cold turkey.' Recent research suggests a direct correlation between food intolerance and weight gain. Last year's Obesity and Weight loss Therapy research . entitled: Eliminating Immunologically-Reactive Foods from the Diet and . its Effect on Body Composition and Quality of Life in Overweight Persons . found that by simply cutting trigger foods out of your diet, the battle . of the bulge could be over. 'Cutting carrots, cow's milk and yeast had an almost instant effect and within days my stomach was flatter' Breakfast: porridge or a smoothie for breakfast (strawberry, banana and blueberry with some natural live yogurt) Lunch: carrots and reduced fat hummus (which she later learned was no good for her) Dinner: chicken with stir fried vegetables (onions, mushrooms, bean . sprouts, carrots, peppers), salmon and salad, omelette (usually using . skimmed milk) Breakfast: Smoothie (strawberry, blueberries, banana and soya or almond milk) Lunch: Soup (homemade potato and leek or root vegetable minus carrots and using dairy-free cream) Dinner: omelette minus milk, jacket potato with tuna and sweetcorn, chicken with vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower) With even seemingly healthy foods such as lettuce having the potential to cause a reaction, the study shows it could be beneficial to find out your own personal triggers. The research assessed the effect that IgG food sensitivity tests and the subsequent elimination of trigger foods for a period of 90 days had on the body composition and quality of life of 120 overweight people. The results showed that the subjects who eliminated the foods they reacted to 'had reductions in weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumferenceâ€¦ and all indicators of quality of life'. 'Food intolerance is a serious issue and is often misdiagnosed. I meet numerous clients who consistently eat healthy and exercise regularly but still find it hard to shift those last few pounds. 'Food intolerances can cause an immune response in the body which can lead to weight gain or difficulty in losing weight' nutritionist, Alli Godbold. Dr. Gill Hart, Scientific Director at YorkTest, explains: 'A stressed digestive system is less able to process energy and nutrients for the rest of the body. It will also be less able to repel harmful invaders and may be more prone to disorders such as IBS. 'Once the immune response is triggered in the body, it feels that it is under siege thus hoarding supplies, storing fluid and increasing weight.'","Sidoine Price, 26, ate healthily but was bloated and overweight .

Scientists have made a breakthrough in the battle against the disease that is ravaging Britain’s ash population. They have unravelled the genetic code of a tree that is resistant to ash dieback. The information could be used to breed ashes that are impervious to the killer fungus – and, in time, repopulate Britain’s forests and woodlands. The scientists behind the breakthrough describe it as ‘giving nature a helping hand’. However, it may not be a help in protecting the UK’s existing ash population, which is being killed off by the rapid spread of the disease. Ash dieback, which ravaged other European countries before entering the UK, kills 90 per cent of the trees it affects. It has spread to 500 sites since first spotted here little more than a year ago . Experts fear it could become the new Dutch elm disease, causing widespread destruction of one of Britain’s best-loved trees. The country’s 80million ash trees support wildlife as well as the £10billion timber industry and take up about a third of British woodland. Researchers at The Sainsbury Laboratory and the John Innes Centre, both in Norwich, have decoded the DNA of a Danish ash tree that was found to be able to withstand the fungus. Known as Tree 35, it remained healthy, while other trees around it withered and died. Scientists around the world are being encouraged to analyse the data, which could be used to seek out ashes in Britain that have a similar genetic profile. Other options include crossing Tree 35 . with native ashes – or breeding with other trees known to be immune to . ash dieback – to create a stock of super-resistant saplings. Saviour: Scientists have identified the genetic code of tree resistant to ash dieback, which kills 90 per cent of the trees it infects . It will take ten to 20 years to breed saplings suitable for restocking the countryside. Professor Allan Downie, of the John Innes Centre, said: ‘We’re trying to give nature a bit of a helping hand by identifying the right kind of trees to do the appropriate crosses. ‘It would be wonderful to be part of the solution but the problem is enormous and breeding is going to take a long time.’ While fungicides might help in some cases, the probability is that Britain will lose most of its ash trees, he said.","Scientists have identified the genetic code of tree resistant to dieback .

He denies two counts of sexual assault and one of indecent assault . A spiritual healer sexually assaulted women who went to him for pain relief, a court heard yesterday. George Boak, 70, told patients his treatment worked by hovering his hands above their body and occasionally touching them. One victim agreed to be naked after Boak claimed his healing methods would be more effective if she undressed. But he allegedly groped her and kissed her breasts, before telling her: ‘Sorry, I got carried away.’ Boak – described as both a ‘spiritual’ and ‘faith’ healer – also put his hands under his clients’ clothing to touch them inappropriately, a jury at Bradford Crown Court was told. He denies two counts of sexual assault and one of indecent assault involving three women. The offences allegedly took place over a ten-year period. Michael Smith, prosecuting, said the women hoped Boak’s skills would help them, but instead he abused their trust and assaulted them. ‘He would sexually touch them when they went to him for treatment for chronic pain,’ he said. The first victim hired the healer, who saw patients at his home in Halifax, West Yorkshire, to treat her severe back pain. She lay on her front for the first hour, while he put his hands on her and moved along her body. She then turned over on to her back and he did the same for the second hour, ‘avoiding the intimate areas’, as he worked. The victim said the treatment worked at first, but she was disconcerted by Boak’s behaviour when he began to tell her she was ‘stunning’ and ‘beautiful’. She felt uncomfortable and stopped visiting, only to return again last year due to chronic back pain. ‘On her last appointment she says the . defendant put his hands down her T-shirt onto her breasts and pushed his . groin against her,’ said Mr Smith. Boak is then alleged to have put . his  hands down her leggings and under her underwear. Then when she tried to get up, he kissed her on her stomach, Mr Smith told the court. The woman went to police and Boak was arrested. Boak told his clients that his treatments worked by hovering his hands above their body and occasionally touching them . Detectives seized his diaries, . contacted other patients and found the second alleged victim who . immediately told police she had been sexually assaulted by him in 2005. She told officers she went to Boak with her husband and the couple were treated together. ‘In due course the defendant suggested the best way of her treatment would be for her to be naked,’ said Mr Smith. ‘Because her husband was present she agreed to receive the treatment naked from the defendant.’ The court heard he touched her private parts and breasts with the flat of his hand. However, when she saw him later . without her husband he  carried on touching her – and even kissed her . breasts, it is claimed. She asked him: ‘George, what are you doing?’ and . he replied: ‘Sorry, I got carried away’, the court was told. The woman . didn’t go to police as she believed she had been ‘gullible’. When questioned about the assault, . Boak admitted the touching but claimed the woman said to him words to . the effect of ‘give it to me, George’. He thought she was asking to be . touched sexually, the court heard. After Boak was charged and appeared in court, a third  complainant contacted police after reading about him in the local paper. She told police he had put his hands . down the front of her  trousers and groped her, but then continued on . with the treatment as if nothing had happened. She went home, told her . husband and never went back to him. Addressing the jury, Judge Jonathan Rose said: ‘There is no suggestion that Mr Boak is a quack or a fake.’ The case continues.","George Boak, 70, faces sexual and indecent assault charges .

At least 14 people were killed and 23 injured in the Pakistani city of Quetta on Saturday, after a bomb exploded on a bus in a university campus and militants released a second bomb as they stormed the hospital where victims were being treated. The first blast ripped through a bus standing on the campus of Sardar Bahadur Khan Women's University at Brewery Road while the students and faculty members were waiting to go home. Many women sustained severe burn injuries as the explosion triggered a fire. TV footage showed flames and black smoke emerging from the bus, which was reduced to a blackened heap of metal. Attack: A bomb blast tore through a bus carrying female university students in southwestern Pakistan killing several people . Militants blew up a historic building in Ziarat in violence-plagued in southwest Pakistan after shooting dead a guard in a predawn attack . Police officials said 14 female students were killed. About an hour later, another blast occurred inside the Bolan Medical Complex where the 23 injured, mostly students, were being taken in. The historic building that was blown up by militants in Ziarat had been the residence of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan . Several militants began firing indiscriminately inside the hospital killing Quetta deputy commissioner Abdul Mansoor Kakar as reported by Geo News channel. Many civil and police officials, including the police chief and chief secretary of Balochistan, were also inside the hospital. No group claimed responsibility for both the attacks, which came hours after militants attacked and destroyed the historic 121-year-old building in Ziarat, about 120 km from Quetta, that was used by Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the last days of his life. A policeman was killed in that attack, which was claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army militants. District police chief Asghar Ali said a bomb disposal squad had found and defused six more bombs, each containing about three kilograms of explosives. Another bomb attack was carried out at a security check-post in the North Nazimabad area of Karachi. Eight people, including two paramilitary personnel and a policeman, were injured in the attack.","Militants blow up bus at Sardar Bahadur Khan Women's University .

Harrassed: Anthony Breeze, pictured with his partner Amanda Lowe, killed himself after being pestered by texts from payday loan firms . Payday loan firms lent money at high interest rates to under-18s, the mentally ill, and even customers who were drunk, an investigation revealed last night. Citizens Advice, which carried out the research, said the lenders were ‘out of control’ and urged the Office of Fair Trading to ban rogue firms. It warned that such practices fuelled debt and misery among the vulnerable. Payday loan firms have been criticised for charging desperate, low-income customers crippling interest rates of more than 4,000 per cent. MPs on the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee are this week expected to demand tough action on the so-called legal loan sharks, and the OFT is already investigating 50. OFT officials gave the firms a 12-week deadline, which expires next month, to improve their practices or risk losing their consumer credit operating licences. It emerged this month that a man killed himself after being pestered by texts from payday loan firms demanding money. Debt-ridden Antony Breeze, 36, from Bolton, who had a six-year-old daughter, burned to death after dousing himself in petrol and setting himself alight. The soaring cost of living has provided rich pickings for loan firms, whose total annual lending has more than doubled from £900million in 2008 to £2billion. Many who borrow small sums are encouraged to roll these over several times, ending up being charged far more than they can afford. An analysis of 780 cases reported to Citizens Advice between November and May found evidence of appalling failures, including arranging loans for under-18s, people with mental health issues and some who were drunk at the time. The charity said the firms make inadequate checks on borrowers, which has led to innocent people being chased for debts run up by criminals using stolen identities. Some firms take more than they are owed from bank accounts and refuse to refund the money, while a number harass people who are in debt and hound others at the same address to shame the borrower into paying up. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘The payday loan industry is out of control and is acting as a law unto itself. It has shown a complete disregard for its customers. ‘Many have been driven into debt by irresponsible lending and their debts ballooned as lenders put pressure on them to extend the loans. ‘The OFT has an opportunity to wipe out the distress caused by this industry and make sure it is transformed into a responsible short-term credit market. It is vital that, following the investigation, the OFT takes swift action to protect consumers from the harm caused by these unscrupulous lenders.’ As well as examining 780 loans in depth, Citizens Advice also looked at customer feedback on 2,000 payday loans from more than 100 lenders. In nine out of ten cases, borrowers were not asked to show that they could afford the loan. This confirmed concerns raised by the OFT, which said: ‘Too many people are granted loans they cannot afford to repay and it would appear that payday lenders’ revenues are heavily reliant on those customers who fail to repay their original loan in full on time.’ Ministers have ruled out putting a cap on the interest rates in what was seen as a victory for the lobbying of the payday loan firms, including the largest, Wonga . It gave the example of someone who borrows £300 for one month with a view to repaying an interest charge of £90, making a total of £390. But if they rolled over the loan three times and paid the interest off, they would end up paying £660. The OFT said that of the 50 firms it is investigating, it has received information from 48 saying they intend to provide proof they are operating within the rules, while the remaining two have surrendered their licences. The Treasury and Department for Business have measures they claim will ensure the firms give a fair deal to customers. These include a new code of practice and tighter rules around the advertising of loans. They also suggested there would be large fines for those that mislead or mistreat customers. However, ministers ruled out putting a cap on the interest rates in what was seen as a victory for the lobbying of the payday loan firms, including the largest, Wonga. The Prime Minister’s former digital adviser, Jonathan Luff, joined Wonga on a six-figure salary last year. The firm has thrived during the recession. It sold a record 2.5million loans in 2011 – equivalent to more than 6,000 a day – and tripled its net income to £45.8million. It is keen to present itself as the acceptable face of payday lenders through its sponsorship of Saturday night TV shows on ITV, such as Red Or Black, which is fronted by Ant and Dec, and Newcastle United football club. The business was founded in 2007 by two South Africans, Errol Damelin and Jonty Hurwitz, both 43. Mr Damelin is now said to be worth £34million, while Mr Hurwitz’s fortune is put at £25million. The Consumer Finance Association, which speaks for the loan firms, insisted they have introduced safeguards to ensure they lend responsibly. These include carrying out credit checks on all new applications, limiting the number of loan rollovers and providing help to those who get in to financial difficulty. Earlier this month, they published a report claiming their customers were generally ‘intelligent, financially-savvy consumers’.","Research carried out by Citizens Advice which urged Office of Fair Trading to ban rogue firms .

A transatlantic flight which made an emergency landing in Scotland after a passenger found a note which read 'I'll set this plane on fire' was back in the air today. Following a search of the aircraft by police officers overnight, it was allowed to continue its journey this morning to America. 'Officers have carried out an extensive search of the aircraft resulting in no suspicious items being found,' said a spokesman for the Scottish Police. 'Tense': Passengers were met by police officers at Prestwick Airport after the unscheduled landing . Fears: The flight was escorted by fighter jets from RAF Leuchars . Alert: Strathclyde Police confirmed that a 'suspicious note' had been found on board the plane . On board: BBC New York producer Nada Tawfik found the note in the cabin toilets scribbled on a napkin . The EgyptAir passenger jet, carrying 326 people, was escorted by Typhoon fighter jets . from RAF Leuchars and met by a convoy of half a dozen police vehicles at Glasgow Prestwick airport. It had been travelling from Cairo to . JFK Airport in New York when it was diverted after the seemingly . threatening note was found in a toilet. Passenger Nada Tawfik, a producer for . BBC New York, was on the flight and said she found the note in the . Boeing 777's toilets by the sink. She immediately told cabin crew who locked the toilet. Egyptian-born Ms Tawfik was flying back to New York after a month visiting her parents in Cairo. Speaking from inside the plane, she told the Mail on Sunday that she went to use one of the toilets about three hours into the flight. She then saw the message on the napkin, which read: ‘I’ll set this plane on fire. Seat 46D.’ Ms Tawfik said: 'I freaked out straight away and thought about my daughter. I went to the back of the plane and showed the note to members of staff. 'They locked the bathroom and said they would take care of it. But nothing happened for a while and I was freaking out, thinking we were in danger. I even walked by 46D but there was just an old woman sitting there. I didn’t think it was a joke. Who jokes like that on a plane these days?' After landing at 2.30pm yesterday, passengers became angry and frustrated as they waited with very little information about what was going on. Ms Tawfik said: ‘It is very chaotic in here.’ Stranded: The EgyptAir flight remains in a secluded part of the airport with 326 passengers on board . Earlier she told the BBC News channel how she had immediately informed cabin crew after finding the note. She . said: 'It was on a hand napkin written in pencil and the pencil was . actually still there so I told the crew to make sure to keep it so they . can get any finger prints off of it. They locked the bathroom . immediately so that no one could go into it.' 'It almost looked like a child's . handwriting or someone who has very sloppy handwriting, but it was very . alarming especially these days when everyone is so concerned about . safety on flights. I said to one of the stewardesses 'I don't know if . this is a prank', they said no, it can't be a prank. 'Either someone has a very bad sense of humour or, you know, it's very scary. 'Ongoing': Strathclyde police made all on board disembark and be interviewed yesterday before they continued their journey this morning . Concern: This passenger plane travelling from Egypt to New York was diverted to Glasgow Prestwick airport and met by armed police officers . Alert: Around half a dozen armed police units were rushed to the airport to meet the plane . After surrounding the plane in a secluded part of the airport, police eventually allowed passengers to disembark the aircraft. It took six hours before all 326 people on board were removed from the plane to be interviewed by police. Detective Superintendent Alan Crawford, of Police Scotland, said: 'The flight had 326 people on board, and as it approached UK and Scottish airspace there was a suspicious note found, the captain and crew took action to divert to Prestwick. 'The vast majority of passengers have now been safely removed from the plane and I fully anticipate they will all be removed very soon along with the crew. 'There may well be different nationalities involved and that could be a challenge for us but we have officers and interpretors to speak to everyone. 'The airport is still open and there is no threat to anyone else in the airport.' Mr Crawford continued: 'The passengers will be taken to a safe place and speak to officers. 'There was no one removed in handcuffs and no one has been detained or arrested and we're continuing our investigation into the note that was found and its origin and motive. 'The terrorist threat has not been increased as a result of this incident today. Police and emergency services continually train for this type of incident and today is a demonstration of all the agencies involved and passengers are being removed safely. Discovery: BBC producer Nada Tawfik said she found the note in the plane's toilets . 'This note, whatever narrative it contained, we have to treat it seriously and maintain the safety of passengers and crew. 'Whether it is a prank or not this . will be investigated thoroughly to establish the circumstances. We could . never write something off as a prank without investigating. 'The captain took the decision to . divert the aircraft and it's now for police to investigate where that . note came from and to see if we can identify who put it within the plane . and what was the circumstances leading to that.' Prestwick is a airport which is designated to deal with emergency incidents. Police said the order in which people . were coming off the plane was co-ordinated to help keep families . together, and to aid looking after elderly or infirm passengers. There were 326 people on the plane, including 307 passengers. Scotland's Justice Secretary Kenny . MacAskill said: 'I am pleased that all passengers are safe and well. Scottish Government officials have been working with Police Scotland and . other agencies, and I am being kept informed of developments. 'Police Scotland have been following protocols that are in place to deal with an incident such as this.' The dramatic landing comes just weeks after a similar incident in which a Pakistani International Airlines flight was escorted to Stansted airport by RAF Tycoon jets following a dispute on board. Two men were later charged with endangering an aircraft.","EgyptAir plane carrying 326 passengers was travelling from Egypt to JFK .

Sentenced: Helen Kupiec was spared jail after stealing more than £8,000 from Shiplake House in Oxfordshire . It was a country house mystery worthy of the shrewd intelligence of Miss Marple herself. When thousands of pounds went missing from a locked library drawer, suspicion inevitably fell on the domestic staff. But without the talents of a crime-solving spinster to call on, millionairess Mary Jane Pugsley, 84, took matters into her own hands. She bought a video camera disguised as an iPhone docking station and hid it in the library of her £2million mansion before leaving £2,000 in a locked drawer. When she later ran footage from the device, she was stunned to see trusted housemaid Helen Kupiec helping herself to half the cash. The 60-year-old who cleaned Shiplake House near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, later  confessed to stealing over £8,000 after Mrs Pugsley confronted her with the recording. She claimed she took the cash to pay off almost £30,000 of credit card debts and bank loans racked up by her drug addict son. Mrs Pugsley, whose late husband Robin once owned the construction firm Bison, was shocked by the betrayal and told a friend she would have given the cleaner the cash if she had asked for it. The widow has lived in the eight-bedroom property since the 1980s. Hidden behind large wrought-iron gates on the banks of the Thames, it is staffed full-time by a security guard, four cleaners, a head gardener, a personal assistant and head of household. Kupiec, a married grandmother, had worked for Mrs Pugsley for three years before the thefts began.In September, the millionairess returned from a trip abroad to find £4,000 was missing from an envelope she had placed in her library, Oxford Crown Court was told. The next time she went away £2,000 disappeared from another envelope which had contained £2,600. ‘Suspicious of what was going on Mrs Pugsley bought a camera disguised as an iPhone docking station,’ said Jonathan Stone, prosecuting. Scene of the crime: £2million Shiplake House near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire . She then hid the motion-sensitive camera in the library, where she put £2,000 in an envelope labelled with the sum inside. When she returned from London later that day, £1,000 had gone, and the figure on the envelope had been amended. Armed with footage of Kupiec taking the money, Mrs Pugsley confronted her on November 16 and gave her a chance to explain herself before calling the police. Kupiec admitted stealing the cash, returned her latest haul and promised to pay back the rest. When . she was interviewed by police she said she had found the key to the . drawer and had used the money to pay off her son’s debts and to buy food . and presents. Hearing: Helen Kupiec was handed a suspended sentence at Oxford Crown Court, pictured . ‘She was stealing to help her son and to keep the drug dealers off his back and away from her family,’ said Nadia Chabat, defending. ‘She is ashamed, she has let down herself but also Mrs Pugsley.’ Recorder Patrick Vincent gave Kupiec a 12-month sentence suspended for two years. He ordered her to pay compensation of £7,250 as well as telling her she must carry out 250 hours of community service. The housemaid, who received a caution in 2009 for stealing £500 from a previous employer, will have to remortgage her home in Purley, south London, to pay off the debts. A family friend of Mrs Pugsley said she had been ‘devastated’ by the betrayal. ‘She is very trusting and discreet and she is a people person,’ the friend said. ‘The worst thing is she told me she probably would have given the cleaner the money if she had just asked for it.’","Mary Jane Pugsley hid a camera at Shiplake House, Oxfordshire .

Five-year-old Chloe Johnson drowned in a hotel swimming pool during a family holiday in Sharm el-Sheikh . The devastated mother of a five-year-old British girl who drowned at an Egyptian holiday resort last night claimed no lifeguards were on duty when the tragedy happened. Sarah Thompson revealed how she and her partner had left their daughter Chloe Johnson playing at the side of the resort’s shallow toddler pool with a friend for five minutes  while they fetched drinks. But Chloe wandered into a wave pool yards away and was found lying unconscious at the side of the pool. ‘She was playing with her little friend,’ said Ms Thompson, 32.  ‘I explained to her twice, called her, told her exactly where  we were before we went to  get a drink.’ Ms Thompson, from Forest Hill, South London, said there were no lifeguards at the pool and staff at the Coral Sea Waterworld Resort in Sharm-el-Sheik made no attempt to resuscitate her daughter, leaving Chloe’s dad Tony, 43, to attempt mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Ms Thompson also revealed that Chloe had survived open-heart surgery when she was just two days old. ‘I am just empty without her,’ she added. Chloe’s grandparents April and Gordon Johnson say it took four hours for emergency services  to arrive after Friday’s tragedy. Mrs Johnson, 67, from Welling, Kent, said: ‘My son was looking for Chloe and a man came running along with her in his arms. We are angry and so hurt. We can’t understand why there were no lifeguards on duty.’ Chloe was taken to her hotel room until an ambulance arrived. The Johnsons claim  it came four hours later. Scroll down for video .

Britain has failed to rank among the top 20 places to be a mother – coming in at a meagre number 23. Researchers say the UK’s poor rating is partially down to higher infant and mother mortality rates than in other parts of Europe. It means this country is now a worse place to have a baby than former Soviet and Balkan countries, which have seen rapid improvements in living standards. The Mother's Index assesses mothers' wellbeing using indicators of maternal health, under-five mortality, levels of women's education, income, and political status. Britain is also four places below Greece, despite the country’s economic turmoil. 1 - Finland . 2 - Sweden . 3 - Norway . 4 - Iceland . 5 - Netherlands . 6 - Denmark . 7 - Spain . 8 - Belgium . 9 - Germany . 10 - Australia . 11 - Austria . 12 - Switzerland . 13 - Portugal . 14 - Slovenia . 15 - Singapore . 16 - France . 17 - Italy . 18 - New Zealand . 19 - Greece . 20 - Ireland . 21 - Estonia . 22 - Canada . 23 - United Kingdom . 24 - Czech Republic . 25 - Israel . The table was compiled as part of  Save the Children’s State of the World’s Mothers report, published today. In the Mothers’ Index, which looks at . how countries around the world are  succeeding in saving the lives of . mothers and newborn babies, Finland, Sweden and Norway took the top . three slots respectively. Ireland ranked at number 20, the US at number 30, Germany at 9 and France number 16. Last year, the UK ranked 10th – but a . spokesman for the charity said the criteria had changed since then so . its fall to 23rd was not a fair like-for-like comparison. One of the main differences is that the number of indicators has been reduced from 12 to five. The index now assesses mothers’ wellbeing using indicators of maternal health, under-five mortality  and . levels of women’s education, income, and political status. The charity said: ‘Reducing the . number of indicators shines a spotlight on what matters most in the . lives of mothers and their children. ‘The indicators now primarily capture . important outcomes.’ Researchers said education was  an important . factor because children of educated women were more likely to survive . and be healthy. Political status was measured  by recording the number of women in national government in each country. It is a factor because when women . have a voice in politics, issues important to mothers and children are . more likely to surface on the national agenda. Income was measured as gross national income per capita and indicates how many resources the mother would have access to. Coming in at number 23, the UK has . fewer women in Parliament and higher maternal and infant mortality rates . than much of Europe, the charity said. Britain has failed to rank among the top 20 places to be a mother - coming in at a meagre number 23 . Women in Britain are at a higher risk . of dying during pregnancy or childbirth than women in Slovakia, . Montenegro and Lithuania, according to the statistics. The report says a reason for this is . the age women are having babies, with teenage and IVF pregnancy rates . resulting in the UK having a higher proportion of young and old mothers . than much of Europe. Another reason is poverty and . inequality. Women with unemployed partners were six times more likely to . die from maternal causes than those with partners in work. However, the UK is also more robust . than many European nations in collecting infant and maternal mortality . data, which may contribute to comparatively higher rates. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa take . up each of the bottom ten places in the index.  In these countries, 10 . to 20 per cent of mothers are underweight due to poor nutrition or . underage pregnancy. The Democratic Republic of Congo ranks as the world’s toughest place to be a mother. Justin Forsyth, CEO of Save the . Children, said: ‘Overall the world has made unprecedented progress in . reducing child and maternal deaths. ‘But there are two big challenges: newborn [deaths] and malnutrition.’ The charity said that globally, one million babies die each year on the . day they are born – or two every minute – making the first day by far . the riskiest day of a person’s life. A baby in the developing world is seven times as likely to die on its first day than one  born in industrialised nations. A baby born in the UK has  a roughly 1 in 200 chance of dying before its fifth birthday, higher than in South Korea  or Israel.","Mother's Index rated Finland as best place to have baby .

The additive is a new version of a substance called methyl cellulose, which is used as a binding agent in snacks such as ready meals and baked goods. A white power, which dissolves in hot water it turns into a gel when it is heated and has been in use for 50 years, almost gluing ingredients together in food. It could be used in a variety of cold foods including yogurts . Conventional versions of methyl . cellulose pass through the stomach too rapidly to have an impact on . satiety, said Dr Huettermann.

Amanda Knox’s former boyfriend has been forced to abandon his new life in Switzerland after authorities revoked his residence permit. Rafaelle Sollecito served four years in prison for the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher, who was found half naked, her throat slit, in the flat she shared with Knox in Perugia. He and Knox were freed on appeal in 2011. But in March this year Italy’s highest court sensationally overturned their verdict, ordering the pair to stand retrial. Raffaele Sollecito served four years in prison for the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher. He and Amanda Knox were freed on appeal in 2011, and he moved to the picturesque Swiss town . Meredith Kercher, who was found half naked, her throat slit in the flat she shared with Knox in Perugia . Immediately afterwards Sollecito left Italy for a new life on the picturesque shores of Lake Lugano, in the Italian-speaking southern Alps. He said he liked Switzerland because people there are ‘more discreet’. The student engineer denied that he was fleeing justice and said he would return to face retrial. He had already been granted residence and registered a not-for-profit company to help victims of miscarriages of justice. The 29-year-old planned to finish his degree in robotic surgery by correspondence while working on his foundation. The charity’s purpose was to review cold cases and produce manuscripts and films to tell their stories. But angry locals, disturbed by the presence of an accused killer in their quiet town, launched a campaign to run him out of town. Right wing politician Daniele Caverzasio petitioned the council saying: ‘Isn’t being on trial for murder a good enough reason to revoke residency?’ Authorities subsequently found that he hadn’t fully declared his pending legal proceedings on his application form. Sollecito’s father, Francesco Sollecito, . condemned the decision, saying it amounted to ‘a moral and social . lynching of someone who has been found not guilty.’ Sollecito's father, Francesco Sollecito, condemned the decision, saying it amounted to 'a moral and social lynching of someone who has been found not guilty' He said: ‘The town of Lugano has missed a good opportunity to show fairness to someone who has always been innocent and must endure two more trials at least.’ Rafaelle will not appeal the council’s decision, his father said, but will instead return to his home town of Giovinazzo, near Bari in southern Italy, immediately. He will finish his final exams to graduate from the University of Verona by long distance study, he said. The retrial is expected to start in the autumn.

The bond between shepherds and their loyal sheepdogs is a rural image portrayed on television shows like the BBC's One Man His Dog. But now the face of hill farming may soon change forever with the introduction of a battery-powered airborne robot to track and round up flocks. The drone, developed by Frenchman Marc-Alexandre Favier, costs a few hundred pounds and could eventually be controlled by smartphone. Drone pack horse: One of the experimental robots developed by the U.S. Department of Defence. It can carry 400 pounds,walk on ice, and navigate streams and ditches . It uses cameras and image recognition software to find sheep and cows even in remote areas. Favier, 27, a postgraduate student at Harper Adams University College, Shropshire, told the Sunday Times: 'It's amazing that the technology is becoming so developed that this sort of thing is possible.' The son of a farmer, he has designed a prototype Unmanned Air System (UAS) to be used as an eye in the sky to manage and monitor livestock on very large and remote estates. Inventor: Marc-Alexandre Favier developed his eye in the sky aid for farmers at university in Shropshire . He used an AR Drone 2 with a camera attached to the bottom to allow the user to get a bird’s eye view and came up with a computer programme which instructs the drone to locate, recognise and track livestock. Although the drone can be controlled via WiFi on a computer, the aim is for farmers to be able to control it using an iPhone or smartphone. Favier  said: 'The number of robots for professional use is increasing significantly so it is very important to be up-to-date with robotics - it’s the future and the present.' He said his prototype was designed with Scottish sheep farmers in mind, many of whom spend large amounts of time and cover many miles monitoring their livestock. In America,  the U.S. Department of Defence in charge of military technology, has developed a robot dog that can run faster than Usain Bolt, follow its leader, and respond to commands . The LS3, or 'Alphadog' as it has been nicknamed, is so lifelike, that it can catch itself slipping on ice , easily navigates streams and ditches and and can carrying 400 pounds. Other drones include hand grenade-sized robots that can be thrown into Afghanistan rebel compounds. Former One Man presenter Clarissa Dickson Wright was unimpressed by the technological breakthrough.

Taking a bite: The lioness takes a nibble on the car as she holds it between her huge paws . Bad taste: She does not seem to like the taste of the device as she licks her lips afterwards . The device was such a success that Mr Bray even managed to get a stunning image of the inside of a lion's mouth. The car got a little too close to an elephant which almost destroyed it by treading on it. But his pictures of inquisitive lions are perhaps the most endearing, as they capture the animals sniffing, pawing and biting the vehicle as they try to work out whether it was worth eating. Lionesses usually do the hunting while male lions watch their young. They sneak up on their intended victims until they reach a distance of around 100ft or less. A number of lionesses usually work together and encircle their intended prey before attacking them. Jaws: the camera captures the inside of a lion's mouth as it takes a bite - showing off its teeth .

Bashed: The camera car took some heavy punishment from some of the animals - and was nearly crushed by an elephant .

The African lion population ranges in estimated size between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild compared to up to 400,000 in 1950.

Ford has designed a range of robot-driven cars to test for safety - just weeks after its chairman announced that self-driving vehicles are closer than we think. The robots can accelerate, steer and even stop for passing pedestrians or other obstacles due to a series of built-in cameras, sensors and GPS trackers. They are also able to carry out more rigorous tests than humans and and put the vans through the equivalent of 10 years of wear and tear in a single sitting driving on specially-designed courses - humans are only allowed to drive these rough courses once a day. Scroll down for video . Ford's automated robot van. Ford is the first car maker to test drive vehicles using robots. Engineers worked with Autonomous Solutions to build the robots capable of subjecting vans to up to 10 years wear and tear in a single sitting. Humans are only allowed to carry out the rigorous tests once a day . Google officially launched its range of Self-Driving Cars in 2010, however the company was not given a licence to test the . technology on roads until May last year. Idealab's founder Bill Gross tweeted a picture of what Google's self-driving cars see when it makes a left turn in May. It showed the car's 360-degree field of view and bore a striking resemblance to the view the Terminator sees in the classic sci-fi films. The cars can analyse the road ahead, watch out for hazards, speed up and slow down without any human input. In March 2012, Google tested just how autonomous their self-driving cars were by getting a blind people to drive the vehicle. Steve Mahan is 95 cent blind. He successfully drove the self-driving car to buy a taco and pick up dry cleaning around Morgan Hill in California. A Google employee sat with Mr Mahan in the Toyota Prius but didn't help him drive. At the end of the journey, he tells his passengers: 'You guys get out, I've got places I have to go.' Ford is the first car maker to develop robotic technology capable of driving vehicles on the company's high-impact on-and off-road testing sites. It claims that the robots are ideal for the job because they are well suited for durability test conditions that would prove too taxing for human drivers. The new technology was most recently used to test Ford's new full-size Transit van due to launch in 2014. The testing is carried out at the company's Proving Grounds in Romeo, Michigan, U.S. The durability technology includes a robotic module installed to the test vehicle that controls steering, acceleration and . braking. The module is set to follow a pre-programmed course and the . vehicle's position is tracked using cameras in a central control room, as well as GPS trackers designed to be accurate to one inch. If the vehicle strays from this programmed course engineers can correct the van's route and restart the test. Onboard sensors can also make the vehicle carry out an emergency stop if a pedestrian or another vehicle strays into the path. The . robotically-driven vehicles are repeatedly put through rigorous tests on Ford tracks that have been nicknamed Silver Creek, Power Hop Hill and . Curb Your Enthusiasm. The different surfaces on these tracks deliberately include broken concrete, cobblestones, metal grates, rough gravel, . mud pits and oversized speed bumps. The robotic Ford vans are fitted with a module that controls steering, acceleration and braking. It is set to follow a pre-programmed course and the vehicle is tracked using cameras in a central control room, pictured. If the vehicle strays off course, engineers can correct the van's route and restart the test . By making the robots drive these courses repeatedly the engineers can subject the vehicles to up to the equivalent of 10 years of daily . driving abuse in just a single sitting. All North American Ford trucks must pass these durability tests before they're are certified for customer use. Dave Payne, Manager of Vehicle Development Operations at Ford, said: 'Some of the tests we do on our commercial trucks for North America are so strenuous that we limit the exposure time for human drivers. 'The challenge is completing testing to meet vehicle development time lines while keeping our drivers comfortable. 'Robotic testing allows us to do both. We accelerate durability testing while simultaneously increasing the productivity of our other programs by redeploying drivers to those areas, such as noise level and vehicle dynamics testing. The cab of the robotic Ford vans are fitted with cameras. The top control module, pictured left, changes gear, steers and applies the handbrake. The foot controls, right, can press the clutch and apply the brakes . Until now, testing speeds and repetitions for specific scenarios were limited due to the health and safety restrictions placed on human drivers. Humans are only allowed to drive certain rigorous courses once a day. The use of robots now makes this testing faster and more efficient, allowing an unlimited number of repeats until Ford engineers are satisfied with the results. These robots also can help Ford develop more challenging durability tests and build tougher trucks. Ford engineers worked with Utah-based Autonomous Solutions to design and manufacture the software and components for the autonomous test vehicles. Ford recently used robotic vans to test its new Transit van, pictured. All testing is carried out at the company's Proving Grounds in Michigan, U.S and courses have been designed to be deliberately rough in order to test the vans' durability.

Scared: Lauren Booth said 'grown men looking like they want to hit Muslim women' on public transport after the murder of Lee Rigby . Tony Blair’s Muslim sister-in-law yesterday claimed she lives in fear of being attacked following the murder of soldier  Lee Rigby. Lauren Booth, who converted two years ago, said ‘grown men look like they want to hit her’ when she takes public transport in London in traditional Islamic dress. The half-sister of Cherie Blair made the comments on television as she attacked Mr Blair for ‘overseeing a war where a million people who are Muslim have been killed’. Her appearance was immediately mocked by viewers, who accused Miss Booth, 45, of being an ‘attention seeker’ and ‘misguided’ for suggesting she could be a victim of the terror attack in Woolwich. Miss Booth, who has also been criticised in recent weeks for marrying a Muslim man before he divorced his wife, appeared on ITV’s Daybreak to argue there had been a change in how Muslims in England are treated in public since Drummer Rigby was killed. The soldier and young father was returning to his barracks in South London last month when he was attacked by Muslim extremists. Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, have both been charged with murder and remanded in custody. In the aftermath of the killing, an Islamic centre in North London and an Islamic school in Kent were both targeted by arsonists in what police believe were suspected reprisals against Muslims. Miss Booth, who appeared on television wearing a patterned hijab, said she had been treated kindly since converting two years ago. Since the terror attack, however, the way women of her religion are viewed has changed, she claimed. ‘When I came to Islam two years ago and I first put on the scarf I was nervous about going on the Underground. I thought everyone is going to see me differently and everyone was beautiful towards me,’ she said. Convert: Lauren Booth, seen here on ITV's Daybreak yesterday, converted to Islam two years ago.

Two people have been charged with murdering the father-of-one . ‘I was invisible for a few weeks and . then I noticed that British people were smiling. Same as we always do, . we’re really good at that, we’re really good at absorbing and accepting . people. But honestly, in the last two weeks I’ve been getting public . transport and there are grown men looking like they want to hit Muslim . women. ‘And I’m a tall, white woman. I’m not easily threatened but I have felt scared at times, so there is a change unfortunately.’ Miss Booth went on to criticise Mr . Blair, who recently argued there was a ‘problem within Islam’, which had . allowed the seeds of extremism to be sown. Asked if he was right, she said: . ‘Absolutely not, and I think it’s very dangerous to take a summary of a . religion from a man who’s overseen the invasion of several Muslim . countries and overseen a war where a million people whom are Muslim have . been killed and millions displaced.’ Earlier this month, Miss Booth was . seen walking with her new husband Sohale Ahmed, 49, in Hampstead Garden . Suburb, North London, where she lives in a £500,000 apartment with her . two daughters. Mr Ahmed’s wife of 16 years, Faiza, . claims he is a bigamist, having married Miss Booth in a Muslim ceremony . while keeping her as his legal wife according to UK law. Despite the accusation, Miss Booth insisted since converting to Islam her life had been ‘peaceful’. She said: ‘We say it’s a clean life…you’re more spiritual and calmer, and hopefully kinder with people.’ The idea Miss Booth would be intimidated on the Tube was ridiculed by viewers. Nini, from London, wrote online: ‘Doubt it.

Today, The Scout Association hailed . the Duchess, who volunteers occasionally with a Cub Scout group close to . her home in North Wales, for a sharp increase in the number of adult . volunteers. A spokesman for the Scouts said the Duchess had done around half a dozen volunteering sessions with her local cubs this year. 'She loves it. I can't see her giving it up,' said Simon Carter, assistant director of the Scout Association. The Duchess is . one of 2,812 new adult volunteers to join this year. These figures . represent the second biggest increase in adult volunteers since 1986. The tradition of the annual celebration event within Windsor Castle dates back eighty years . Catherine met hundreds of Scouts from across the UK and Commonwealth at the ceremony . The Scouting Association credited Kate with boosting volunteer numbers within the organisation . As . well as attracting more adults the total number of teenagers in . Scouting has almost doubled in the last 10 years, from 23,446 in 2003 to . 40,578 in 2013. However, . despite attracting more adults, the Movement still has 37,867 young . people on waiting lists who are unable join up because even more adult . volunteers are needed. Bear Grylls, Chief Scout, said: 'It’s . great that so many adults are joining the Scouts, and I am sure the . increase has had much to do with the Duchess of Cambridge becoming a . Scout volunteer last year. 'The Duchess is an incredible role model and she helps us show that Scouting’s not just for boys. 'She’s also such a generous volunteer . and everyone is so excited to have her in the Scouting family. Many . people have followed her lead and are getting involved and enjoying the . adventure.' It is the first time Kate has stepped in for the Queen, pictured with Bear Grylls during last year's event . Bear Grylls said the Duchess is an 'incredible role model' and proves Scouting is 'not just for boys' Chief Scout Bear Grylls said the Duchess is a 'generous volunteer' within the 'Scouting family' He added: 'All . the young people at Windsor Castle ceremony have given so much time and . energy to achieve their Queen’s Scout Awards, and I admire their spirit . so much. 'They are huge inspirations to all the other Scouts across in the UK and I am so pleased that both the Duchess of Cambridge and Scouting have honoured them. Reaching Queen's Scout is a remarkable achievement and along the way they will have all had the adventure of a lifetime.' As one of the UK’s most high profile figures, it’s hoped the Duchess’ involvement will inspire other adults to get involved in Scouting. With waiting lists at an all-time high of . almost 38,000, there is an urgent need for more volunteers, in order to . meet the growing demand. The Duchess, pictured during a visit to the Great Tower Scout Camp last month, has volunteered with her local North Wales cubs about six times this year . The Duchess of Cambridge was last seen in public with the Queen when she accompanied her on a visit to Baker Street underground station to mark the 150th anniversary of the London Underground where she was given a 'Baby on Board' badge . Sazeda Patel, a volunteer from Blackburn, said: 'I didn’t think I’d have the time to volunteer, but the Scouts make it really easy to volunteer around my other commitments – and they let me give as much or as little time as I’m able. 'I did my training with the Duchess in Cumbria last month and had a great day with her. If someone as busy as the Duchess can find time to volunteer, anyone can! I couldn’t recommend volunteering more highly; I just wish I’d got involved sooner.' All this underlines the fact that Scouting is the largest co-educational youth Movement in the UK. On the back of eight consecutive years of growth, total membership has increased over 20% since 2005, to 536,787 this year.

For this is not just any giant warehouse - it's Marks & Spencer's new automated storage hub that the company hopes to streamline its online ordering service. The retailer opened its new 900,000 sq ft distribution centre yesterday in Castle Donington, Leicestershire, to handle all of the company's online orders and store deliveries. Giant storage space: Marks & Spencer opened its new 900,000 sq ft distribution centre in Leicestershire yesterday . Vast: The shelving units, which are massive at 25ft tall, are capable of holding around 16million items of clothing and food . Hub: The centre replaces more than 100 smaller distribution centres around the UK and will handle process around a million items a day . Sweet success: The centre is capable of holding up to 2.3billion of M&S's Percy Pig sweets . Eventually the centre's neck-achingly high floor to ceiling storage system will be packed with around 16million items of clothing and food. Fully automated 'robots' will collect goods from the vast shelving stack, which stands at 25 metres high, as it is ordered. The first customer orders were shipped out from the warehouse last week and it is hoped that the centre will process up to a million items every day. Around 1,200 people will be employed at the site. The centre, the size of 11 Wembley Stadium-sized football pitches, is one of the largest of its kind in the UK. It was opened as part of a seven year project to create a 'fast, agile and flexible supply chain' according to M&S.

When a barrel of glowing green radioactive ooze was spilt into the sewers of New York City and landed on four lost pet turtles, it spawned 'the world's most fearsome fighting team'. However the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have yet to be spotted fighting crime in Philadelphia, where a man checking out a sinkhole in a street saw something unexpected inside â€” a pool of what looked like green ooze. Steven Reitz said the sinkhole opened in the Northern Liberties section of the city last week and the ooze appeared several days later. Suspicious: The green ooze spotted by Steven Reitz in the Northern Liberties district of Philadelphia . He said when he and some friends spotted the green pool, they didnâ€™t know what to make of it. 'We kind of walked over and looked and saw the neon green and said, ""Whoa, look at that"",' said Mr Reitz. He was right to be concerned, for where there is green ooze, according to the seminal Eighties and early-Nineties cartoon and comic book series, there may well be mutants. According to the Turtles storyline, green ooze was poured into the sewers by the evil ninja villain Shredder in an attempt to poison his honourable ninja rival Master Yoshi, who was living there after his exile from the Foot Clan. But the plan only half worked and Yoshi was transformed into an anthropomorphic rat, and four turtles he had discovered and taken as pets to become humanoid themselves. Yoshi adopts the four mutant amphibians as his sons and trains them in the art of ninjutsu, whereupon they vow to take revenge on Shredder and halt his criminal career.

The hole had been boarded up by the time Mr Reitz checked it again later that day, he said, adding that similar sinkholes appear every year and appear to be moving down the road. Gary Burlingame, director of labs for the Philadelphia Water Department, said the colouring is simply dye, which helps workers determine the origins of sinkholes. Workers pour the dye into flowing water underground, he said, then go to a manhole down the street and look into it. If they see the color they poured into the system, they know the water is flowing in that direction. Mr Burlingame stressed the dye is safe, non-toxic and biodegradable.","Similar-looking green ooze poured into New York storm sewer by the evil ninja Shredder spawned the heroes in a half shell .

In June it was revealed Mr Kelly likes to do target practice with exactly the same kind of gun which was used to shoot her - as she cheers him on from their porch. The couple admit they still love the ‘gun culture’ and argue that their knowledge of guns gives them more credibility with the gun lobby and the National Rifle Association. They have made themselves strident gun campaigners and Giffords’ face is now on a huge billboard in New York’s Times Square asking for tougher checks on those buying firearms. Mr Kelly bought the assault rifle in March at a gun shop in Tucson to show how easy it was to buy such a weapon. But after his motives became public the shop owner refused to hand it over and gave him a refund, claiming that it was not for ‘personal use’ so he could not sell it. At the time, Todd Rathner, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association's affiliate in Arizona and a national NRA board member, questioned the point that Mr Kelly was trying to make. He said: ‘If you believe him, it's a cheap publicity stunt. If you don't, then he was speculating on the value of the rifle because he knew the prices would be inflated.’","Former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, 43, was shot in the head in January 2011 in Arizona .

The original, handwritten manuscript of ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ and the 1813 flag that inspired the song's lyrics will be displayed together at the Smithsonian in Washington, the first time the historic pieces are believed to have been shown side by side. The manuscript is normally on display at the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore and the flag has been at the Smithsonian since the early 1900s. They'll be displayed together from Flag Day, June 14, through July 6. The three-week display is the start of celebrations marking 200 years since the song was written on September 14, 1814. Inspirational: The 1814 Star-Spangled Banner manuscript by Francis Scott Key . Bonnie Lilienfeld, a Smithsonian curator who is working on the manuscript's display in Washington, said she hopes the exhibit will help people think more about where the song's words came from. Having the two objects together provides an ‘aha moment,’ said Jennifer Jones, the curator who oversees the flag. ‘It's meant to be emotional. It's meant to be reflective,’ she said. Francis Scott Key was a 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet when he wrote the song's words during the War of 1812. Key watched as the British bombarded Baltimore's Fort McHenry for more than 24 hours. When he saw the fort's Star-Spangled Banner flag flying on the morning after the bombardment, a signal that U.S. troops had withstood the enemy, he was inspired to write a poem originally called ‘Defense of Fort McHenry.’ The poem, set to music and later renamed, became the country's national anthem in 1931. A family views the Star Spangled Banner at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington . Key's original manuscript, written with quill and ink, has two surprises for people who know the song. First, Key's poem is actually four stanzas, though the first stanza is the only one that's traditionally sung. And, second, Key wrote, ‘Oh say can you see through the dawn's early light,’ but crossed out ‘through’ and wrote ‘by.’ Americans may be more familiar with the flag, which gets millions of visitors a year at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. The flag has been at Smithsonian for more than a century after being given to the institution by the family of Major George Armistead. Armistead was the commander of Fort McHenry and the man who commissioned the banner in 1813 with 15 stripes and 15 stars, representing the number of states in the Union at the time. Except for a period during World War II, when it was housed in Virginia for safekeeping, the flag hasn't traveled outside of Washington since coming to the Smithsonian. Key's manuscript has traveled only slightly more often since being purchased for the historical society in the 1950s. In 2011 it was taken by armored vehicle, with a police escort, to the state's capital in Annapolis and to Fort McHenry. And in 2013, the museum brought the manuscript to Mount Olivet Cemetery in Frederick, Maryland, where Key is buried. Burt Kummerow, the president of the Maryland Historical Society, said he hopes this summer's exhibit will be a chance for people to study the song's words. He compared the song to a church hymn, something that has become so familiar that what Key was trying to say can get lost. And he called putting the manuscript and flag together a ‘very, very special moment.’ ‘It isn't going to happen again anytime soon,’ he said.","The display is part of celebrations marking the song's 200th anniversary .

The British taxpayer has spent £1.7million in eight years on the battle to kick out Abu Qatada, it emerged today. More than a third of the bill is to cover the legal aid claims made by the radical cleric against attempts to deport him to Jordan. Critics slammed the huge sum which could pay for 90 police officers for a year. The deportation of radical Islamist cleric Abu Qatada took a step closer after the Jordanian government agreed a treaty with the UK . Home Secretary Theresa May revealed the scale of the legal bill in a letter to MPs. She told the Home Affairs Select . Committee that the £1,716,306 figure includes Qatada's legal aid costs of £647,658. The Home Office has spent more than £1 million pursuing the case through the courts. Committee chairman Keith Vaz MP said: . 'I am shocked that Abu Qatada's legal costs alone could have employed 90 . new constables for a year.' 'The Home Secretary needs to ensure the Mutual Assistance Treaty is ratified as soon as possible, before our bill for Mr Qatada rises any higher. 'I am glad that the King of Jordan is visiting Parliament in the near future. He would be welcome to take Mr Qatada back with him.' A Legal Aid Agency spokesman said: 'The Legal Aid Agency has done everything in its power to ensure Abu Qatada contributes towards his legal costs and have secured frozen assets of £217,286.57. 'Legal aid for Special Immigration Appeals Commission cases is only available if the applicant passes strict financial means and legal merits tests. 'These cases are managed by the Legal Aid Agency under a case plan system, so that costs are carefully controlled throughout.' The prospect of finally removing Qatada from the UK had seemed remote for years, but this week the Jordanian parliament . approved a new treaty with British designed to finally kick him out. Last . month, Qatada unexpectedly volunteered to leave the country as soon as . the treaty between the UK and Jordan is ratified by both countries. Mrs May announced in April that she had thrashed out a mutual assistance treaty with Jordan, guaranteeing Qatada the right to a fair trial. Home Secretary Theresa May has pinned her hopes on the treaty to finally end the decade-long saga of government attempts to oust him . Human rights judges in Britain and . Strasbourg had halted his removal to Jordan on the grounds some of the . evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. The . agreement has now been approved by both houses of the Jordanian . parliament but must still be signed off by the country's King Abdullah. The UK Government expects the treaty to be ratified in Britain by June 21. It . does not name Qatada directly, but it states that any evidence used to . prosecute someone who is to be deported cannot be used 'unless the . prosecution in the receiving State proves beyond any doubt that the . statement has been provided out of free-will and choice and was not . obtained by torture or ill-treatment by the authorities of the receiving . State'. September 16 1993 - The Jordanian father of five claims asylum when he arrives in Britain on a forged passport. May 1998 - He applies for indefinite leave to remain in Britain. April 1999 - He is convicted in his absence on terror charges in Jordan and sentenced to life imprisonment. February 2001 . - He is arrested by anti-terror police over involvement in a plot to . bomb Strasbourg Christmas market. Officers find him in possession of . £170,000 in cash, including £805 in an envelope marked 'For the . mujahedin in Chechnya'. August 2005 - The preacher is arrested under immigration rules as the Government seeks to deport him to Jordan. April 2008 . - The Court of Appeal rules that deporting him would breach his human . rights because evidence used against him in Jordan may have been . obtained through torture. February 18 2009 . - In a landmark judgment, five Law Lords unanimously back the . Government's policy of removing terror suspects from Britain on the . basis of assurances from foreign governments. It is ruled he can be . deported to Jordan to face terror charges.April 18 2012 - Abu Qatada lodges an appeal - potentially delaying his deportation by months. March . 6 2013 - He is returned to jail over fears the terror suspect was . trying to communicate with associates, in breach of bail conditions. March 27 2013 . - Court of Appeal admits hate preacher is 'very dangerous' but rules . sending him to face a terror trial in Jordan would not be fair.April 17 2013 - Home Office says it will take its battle to the Supreme Court. April 23 2013 - Court of Appeal rejects government request to appeal. Asked whether Mr . Cameron had booked Qatada's plane ticket to Jordan, a Downing Street . spokesman said: 'Obviously the announcement . from Jordan is good news but from our perspective the case is . still on-going and the Prime Minister is clear in his determination to . put Abu Qatada back on a plane to Jordan.' Ministers have been trying for a decade to send Qatada to Jordan, where he is accused of plotting a terrorist atrocity to coincide with the Millennium. His removal was originally approved by the British courts, only to be halted by the European Court of Human Rights last year. Judges in Strasbourg said he would not get a fair trial because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. Controversially, Mrs May opted not to appeal against this verdict. Instead, she and her ministers secured personal promises from the Jordanian authorities there would be no use of torture evidence, and began the deportation process again in the UK legal system. But last November, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission said it was not satisfied with the assurances, and halted Qatada’s removal. The court said it must reflect the Strasbourg ruling. That decision was upheld by the Appeal Court and the same court refused permission for the Home Secretary to challenge the ruling in the Supreme Court. However the treaty with Jordan is seen as a major breakthrough in finally ending the logn and expensive saga. A Home Office spokesman said: 'The Government remains committed to securing Qatada's deportation as quickly as possible. 'We are pleased the Jordanian parliament has approved the treaty and we await its full ratification by the Jordanian government and the completion of ratification procedures in the UK.' Qatada is currently behind bars in London's Belmarsh prison after breaching a bail condition which restricts use of mobile phones and other communication devices. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) previously heard that a USB stick understood to belong to Qatada's oldest son contained 'jihadist files' made by the ''media wing of al Qaida'. Qatada is also being investigated by Scotland Yard over suspected extremist material found during the search of his home. The Metropolitan Police passed on the material to Danish authorities to reportedly investigate a connection with a controversial Islamic publisher.","A third of the bill has been run up by radical cleric's legal aid bills .

A young dental nurse tragically froze to death yards from her sister's house after finding herself locked out after a night out. Bernadette Lee, 25, who was wearing a short dress, had no coat and had taken her shoes off, was found lying dead in the snow near to her older sister Jodie's house on January 19. An inquest heard how she had been due to stay with a friend after the Saturday night out but they became separated. Bernadette then made her way to her sister's house but unknown to her, Jodie, 33, had lost her keys and was staying elsewhere so there was no-one to let her in. Her mobile phone showed she made 27 calls in her final hours desperately trying to contact friends but they ended at 3.51am. A report from Kent Police, read to the inquest, said Miss Lee had been drinking at a friend's house and later went to a nightclub. She had intended to spend the night at her friend Cheryl Coley's house but became separated from the group. At 2.30am she got a lift with three other people to Middle Deal Road in Deal, Kent. They went into a house without her, while Miss Lee tried to call Miss Coley. The inquest heard that between 1.54am and 3.17am she had called her friend four times but Miss Coley later told police she had had a row with her partner and had been constantly on the phone during that time. There was evidence Miss Lee had tried to call her dad Roger on his mobile but that was switched off. She had also tried to call 'numerous' other friends. Miss Coley told police she had a 'special friendship' with Miss Lee who knew she could turn up at any time and stay. Night out: Miss Lee became separated from her friends and made 27 calls from her phone in her final hours . As temperatures plunged to minus 2C Miss Lee lay down in the snow and died from hypothermia. Her body was found by a dog walker at . 7.50am on a lawn in Deal, Kent. He initially thought he had seen a . mannequin lying in the snow before realising it was a body. He noticed she didn't have a coat on, was only wearing a dress, and he saw a mobile phone on the ground nearby. He shook Bernadette's body, thinking she might be asleep, before realising she appeared to be dead and dialled 999. The . North East Kent coroner heard she had a high level of alcohol in her . body which would have put her at higher risk of hypothermia. A post mortem showed there was no sign of any violence or injury to the body. After the inquest Bernadette's . family, from Canterbury, Kent said her death could have been 'so easily . avoided' and begged partygoers to take care in cold temperatures. Her . father Roger, 63, and sister Jodie said: 'We hate the thought of other . families ever having to go through such a harrowing ordeal. Tragic: Miss Lee was found dead by a dog walker in the garden of a house in Deal, Kent . Snowy: The street where the body of Miss Lee (right) was found was covered in snow in January (left) 'We would like to say to everyone please don't put yourself in a situation where you are totally dependent on someone else as things can go wrong. 'Always take a coat in the winter as plans can so easily change. 'If you arrange for someone to stay with you then please be responsible and remember that their lives could depend on you.' Jodie added: 'My sister Bernie was such a lovely girl and she didn't deserve to die like this.' While Mr Lee said: 'I'm devastated. My life will never be the same again. I brought her up by myself and we were very close. Street: Her body was found near her sister's house in Church Meadows, in Deal, Kent . 'We could speak for hours and hours on the phone. She was a beautiful girl and very intelligent. 'I loved her so much - everybody did. She was a very popular girl, a lovely girl. 'Bernadette's friend said she had had a lot to drink and that she was wearing a dress with no coat. 'That was typical of Bernadette. She always wanted to look good when she went out.' The inquest was told she died of hypothermia and alcohol intoxication. Coroner Rebecca Cobb recorded a . verdict of misadventure and explained: 'That is similar to an accident . but it means there were aspects of her behaviour that were involved in . her death, like the alcohol she had consumed.'","Bernadette Lee, 25, was found frozen to death in snow after a night out .

Scientists believe they are closer to solving the mystery of why leprosy suddenly declined in Europe 500 years ago. Leprosy used to be one of the biggest killers across the continent with victims being cast out of towns and villages. It is still found in 91 countries worldwide and infects 225,000 people each year but in Europe it suddenly declined in the sixteenth century. The scientists used metagenomics to describe the open-ended sequencing of DNA from samples taken from the Hungarian mummy. A similar approach was used by another group of scientists to recover a leprosy genome from skeletons (pictured) a few weeks ago . One of the most popular theories as to why it declines was that the pathogen evolved and lost its virulence. But scientists have now been able to discard the theory after discovering that the pathogen found today in the Middle East and other parts of the world is virtually identical that that of medieval Europe. The discovery, made after genetic analysis of Mycobacterium leprae, the leprosy pathogen, recovered from Medieval bones in Britain, Sweden and Denmark, suggests that Europeans developed a natural resistance to the disease. In a study published in the journal Science an international team of researchers concluded: ‘The sudden decline of leprosy in 16th century Europe was almost certainly not due to the medieval European strain of M. leprae losing virulence. ‘Extraneous factors such as other infectious diseases like plague or tuberculosis, changes in host immunity or improved social conditions may have accounted for its decline.’ In Europe sufferers were outcasts and had to ring bells to warn others of their approach. In 1873 Norwegian physician Gerhard Hansen identified Mycobacterium leprae as the pathogen that caused the disease. In the 1970s multi-drug therapies were developed as a cure. Symptoms can take 20 years to appear. Of the 3.3 million chemical letters found in the modern pathogen’s genome, just 20 were different to the Medieval version, said Dr Johannes Krause, a paleogeneticist at the University of Tuebingen in Germany. ‘If the explanation of the drop in . leprosy cases isn't in the pathogen, then it must be in the host, that . is, in us; so that's where we need to look, said Dr Stewart Cole, . director of the Global Health Institute in Switzerland. ‘In certain conditions, victims could simply be pressured not to procreate. In addition, other studies have identified genetic causes that made most Europeans more resistant than the rest of the world population, which also lends credence to this hypothesis.’ He said it remains unclear if leprosy was taken to the Middle east by Europeans or the other way around but it is likely it spread during the Crusades. ‘We didn't have the data to determine the direction in which the epidemic spread,” said Dr Cole. ‘The pathogen could have been carried to Palestine during the Crusades. But the process could have operated in the opposite direction, as well.’ The leprosy pathogen was especially well preserved in the bones of this 25-year-old woman from Denmark .","Britons and other Europeans thought to have built up resistance to leprosy .

Their holiday company charges couples an extra fee so they can sit together on a plane – even if they are going on honeymoon. A passenger was told it would cost £7.50 per seat to make sure she could sit with her fiance on flights for their upcoming £1,800 Thomson package holiday to Sicily . TUI Travel, which owns Thomson and . First Choice, demands £7.50 per seat to guarantee a spot together. This . amounts to £30 per couple for return flights. Miss De Filippo, 43, and her partner . were told they would have to pay the extra fee after they had already . forked out £1,800 for their holiday. She discovered the surcharge after . booking the Thomson package holiday to the southern Italian island. When . she viewed her pre-assigned seats online, the legal secretary saw they . were separated by an aisle. She rang customer services and tried to change positions, but was asked to pay £7.50 per alteration. ‘The agent assured me the charge was correct,’ she said. ‘He said they have had lots of complaints.’ Couples and friends would be charged by Thomson and First Choice to change their bookings so they could sit together - only parents with children would be exempt . Miss De Filippo, of Radlett, . Hertfordshire, is refusing to pay the fee, so she and her partner will . have to sit separately on the three-hour flight. ‘It just makes me . seethe,’ she said. Yesterday German-owned TUI Travel, . which sells holidays to millions of Britons every year, confirmed that . the fee applies to all holidaymakers flying with Thomson Airways apart . from parents sitting with children. No exception is made for . honeymooners. All Thomson passengers and many First . Choice passengers fly on Thomson Airways flights. A spokesman said: . ‘A  charge is applied for these services, giving customers the peace of . mind that they will be seated together.’ A Thomson spokesman added: ‘Thomson . Airways always tries to seat customers travelling together next to each . other wherever possible. However, along with many other UK airlines, we . offer an optional extra service whereby customers can pre-book specific . seats. ‘This service not only guarantees that customers can sit together, but also allows them to choose their preferred seats.’ ABTA, the Travel Association told MailOnline that this was a system that other carriers also used: “Many airlines give the option of paying in advance for pre-allocated seating which has proved popular with passengers avoiding the need to check-in very early. ""You may well still sit together even if you have not used pre-allocation but booking in advance removes a degree of uncertainty. Airlines will always ensure that families with small children sit close to each other.” Last year TUI, which made pre-tax . profit of £390million in 2012, came under fire after claims it was . forcing holidaymakers who had already paid for trips to shell out extra . cash before they departed to cover exchange rate and fuel price . fluctuations.

Duwayne Brooks, pictured at the Old Bailey in 2011, was allegedly taped when he met officers with his legal counsel. Neither he nor his lawyer were aware they were being recorded, according to a police source who spoke to the BBC . Scotland Yard was last night . investigating new claims that its officers secretly bugged meetings with . Stephen Lawrence’s best friend. Duwayne Brooks, who was with the . teenager on the night he was murdered, was allegedly monitored as he met . detectives with his lawyer. Sources claimed the force was given permission to record two meetings as they hunted those behind the 1993 racist murder. But details of the clandestine . operation raised further questions about the treatment of the Lawrence . family and their supporters. It came as Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said . he would support a public inquiry into claims undercover officers were . used in a smear operation. But the Met chief warned that it could be . slow and inconclusive, with any criminal allegations sent back to police . for investigation. Stephen’s father Neville has demanded a . judge-led inquiry, dismissing as ‘completely unsatisfactory’ plans to . examine the allegations within the scope of two ongoing inquiries. His second son Stuart said the . expensive process could be avoided if Sir Bernard answered ‘13 . questions’ about the controversy submitted by his lawyer. Claims that . police bugged Mr Brooks will inflame the crisis at the Met over its use . of undercover officers and secretive tactics. Now a councillor in Lewisham, . South-East London, Mr Brooks’s life was thrown into turmoil in the wake . of the killing. The two teenagers were standing at a bus stop when a . gang of youths attacked them and stabbed Stephen to death. It is claimed that the bugged meetings . were held in an interview room at the offices of Deighton Guedalla, in . Islington, North London, in 1999 or 2000. Scroll down for video . Loss: Stephen Lawrence was murdered by a gang of white youths in an unprovoked attack while waiting for a bus in south-east London in April 1993 . Mr Brooks’s solicitor, Jane . Deighton, demanded answers and said there was no reason for police to . record the meetings which they had requested. Just weeks after Stephen’s racist murder, the teenager’s distraught parents publicly accused extremists of trying to make political capital out of his death. Neville and Doreen Lawrence accused Trotskyites of using the killing as an excuse for political violence. In May 1993, they called for a march planned by the Anti-Nazi League and the Left-wing organisation Panther UK to be cancelled. The two groups are likely to have been among those  monitored by undercover officers in case they resorted to violence. Mrs Lawrence told the Mail: ‘When the Panther UK people came to me, I was really frightened of them. We told them to back off. We do not want to know.’ Mr Lawrence added: ‘We are aware there are people who want to make this into something else . . . They have organised these demonstrations without consulting us.’ She said: ‘That is very worrying for . Duwayne Brooks and for ourselves because it is quite sinister. Why . covertly record a meeting that you have asked for? ‘Why unless it is part of something . much bigger, why unless in fact covert recordings were happening of . Duwayne Brooks and ourselves in different situations? That is what we . want to know.’ One former Yard detective said: ‘There . is no reason not to record a significant witness, in fact it’s good . practice. 'But officers should be open about it, and ask the witness and . his lawyers first. Doing it covertly is underhand and could later . undermine trust. As it has.’ Earlier this week a police . whistle-blower claimed senior officers wanted him to help ‘smear’ the . Lawrence family. Former undercover officer Peter Francis said he was . sent in to infiltrate anti-racist groups that supported the Lawrence . family. Prime Minister David Cameron described the allegations as ‘horrific’ and vowed to ‘get the full truth out’. Undercover cop Peter Francis made the explosive claim that he had been ordered to find 'dirt' on the murdered teenager's family . Speaking yesterday, Mr Francis . revealed that he helped gather information on politicians during their . earlier careers, including former Home Secretary Jack Straw. Mr Francis said he was asked to . provide intelligence on ‘subversives’, which included young students . with links to radical politics. He said they included Mr Straw and Labour MPs Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Brooks was paid £100,000 . compensation seven years ago after a marathon legal battle over his . treatment by police.

Police chiefs feared there would be year-long riots if they went public about trying to smear the Stephen Lawrence family. Peter Francis, the ex-police spy turned whistleblower, said senior Metropolitan Police officials had discussed whether to disclose the undercover operation to the 1998 Macpherson Inquiry. But he claimed that, fearing a huge backlash against such abhorrent tactics, they opted for a cover-up. Mr Francis, who personally spied on the Lawrence family, said the view of Special Branch commanders was that ‘if the public was to find out you were undercover there, they’d still be battling on the streets for about a year to come’. Former Home Secretary Jack Straw said the claim was ‘very serious’. Ex-Met Commissioner Paul Condon, who was in charge at the time, said he did not authorise or condone any withholding of information from Macpherson.

Jailed: Keno Forbes, 35, who was jailed for drug dealing has won the right to stay in Britain indefinitely . A Jamaican crack dealer who went by the name 'Blood' has won the right to stay in Britain despite being jailed for drug offences. Keno Forbes, 35, was also banned from an entire London Borough but has been told he can stay in the country because deporting him would breach his family life. Forbes, who admitted 11 charges of supplying class A drugs, was jailed at Blackfriars Crown Court in 2011 for three years for dealing heroin and cocaine in Islington, North London, and he cannot go back there for 10 years. The Home Office initially applied to have the Jamaican deported but he won his initial tribunal and then won an appeal as well. Mr Justice McCloskey, president of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber Upper Tribunal, said it was a 'borderline case' but ruled that he had decided 'narrowly in favour' of allowing Forbes to stay. His lawyers successfully argued that deporting Forbes would ruin his relationship with his wife and children. He concluded that if the Jamaican was deported: 'His wife and children will, realistically, remain in the United Kingdom, giving rise to long term decimation of their established family life.' Forbes . was first arrested in July 2011 following a police crackdown on drug . dealers called Operation Amargosa. He had a previous conviction for . possessing Class A drugs from 2009. Drug dealer: Keno Forbes was arrested during a 2011 crackdown on drug-dealing in the Caledonian Road area of Islington, north London . Appeal: Forbes won his case when it went before the Immigration and Asylum Chamber Upper Tribunal . At the time of his conviction, Police Constable Claire Millward, from the Islington Crime Squad, said: 'This was a protracted investigation to tackle illegal drugs supply in the borough. Forbes came into Islington solely to sell drugs. 'His sentence and subsequent ASBO means that he will no longer be able to saturate the streets with his illegal drugs or indeed make a profit from his criminal activities.' A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'We are disappointed by the tribunal's decision and are now considering our options in this case. We firmly believe foreign nationals who break the law should be deported. 'We are starting the deportation process earlier and removing foreign criminals quicker than ever. Since 2010, the Home Office has removed or deported more than 17,000 foreign national offenders, including 4,765 in 2012. 'Through our Immigration Bill we will reduce the 17 rights of appeal to four and those with no right to be here will not be able to prevent deportation simply by dragging out the appeals process. 'The Bill will also give the full force of primary legislation to our policy that foreign criminals should ordinarily be deported despite their claim to a family life.'","Keno Forbes was jailed for three years for supplying cocaine and heroin .

While many children her age were enjoying running around, 19-month-old Campbell Pruden was begging her parents to carry her, screaming that her legs felt 'too tight'. The little girl, who is now three, has since been diagnosed with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis - and has revealed her astonishing bravery as she battles the painful condition. At times she has taken as many as eight medications and now receives  intravenous injections of powerful immune-suppressant medicines that keep her in hospital in Phoenix for up to five hours. She calls the procedures her 'stupid tubes' as she often gets tangled in the IV lines while trying to play like any child her age. Little Campbell is just one of the 300,000 children in the country suffering from arthritis - which many people mistakenly believe only affects adults. Fighter: Campbell Pruden, now three, was 19-months-old when she was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis . Her parents, Kim, who is pregnant with twins, and John, who has a fundraising page for the cause, first noticed something was wrong when the toddler developed a limp and refused to walk in 2011. 'In the beginning when there were all those unknowns, we knew we had to get to the bottom of it,' her mother told ABC News. 'But at the same time, we had to keep that poker face with her to give her the confidence that, ""You are O.K. and you are going to be O.K.""' As well as the medications, they manage the condition with her diet - by keeping her of red meat and dairy as part of an anti-inflammation diet - and encourage her to take part in physical activities. 'We keep her moving, we keep her . active and we take one day at a time,' she said. 'When she is not . feeling well, we respect that, but it's important not to make that a . crutch or an excuse.' Support: Her parents Kim and John encourage her to stay as active as possible to battle the condition . Arthritis is a term for many autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. There are more than 100 different types of arthritis. While many believe it only affects adults, more than 300,000 . children in the U.S. are living with the disease, according to . the Arthritis Foundation - making it one of the most common childhood diseases in the U.S. Juvenile arthritis is caused by the body attacking its own healthy cells, causing the joints to become inflamed. Children with the condition suffer swollen joints, the tightening of soft . tissue and bone erosion that affects or stops growth. Inflammation can also affect . the spleen or the membranes covering the lungs and heart. Many forms . of arthritis can cause irreversible joint damage if they are not recognized early enough. Once diagnosed, children can be treated with therapy or medications, and are encouraged to stay active. They said their little 'trooper' enjoys taking hikes with them and 'wants to do everything we do'. Her mother added that while symptoms often appear to subside, she will battle the condition for the rest of her life. The family said they now aim to raise awareness of the condition, hopeful that people will realize it is not just adults who suffer from arthritis. 'These children live . in pain every day and can't even wake up and go to school because of the . pain in their body,' Kim said. 'We need to find a cure, to find a way for these . kids to lead strong, happy lives.' Another family battling with the condition is the Schultz family, who live in Charleston, South Carolina. Five-year-old Amelia and her little sister Liberty, three, both have juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which affects their joints 'from head to toe,' their mother, Lisa, told ABC. Amelia was diagnosed just before she turned two after she stopped walking and began crawling. She would scream during diaper changes and 'her knees were the size of oranges', her mother said. Her little sister also developed the condition when she was just 15 months old . Battle: Amelia (right) and Liberty (left) Schultz have also suffered from the condition since they were toddlers . Strong: The Schultz family, whose son does not have the condition, said the girls have improved with medication . 'One day in the tub I saw that one knee . was way bigger than the other knee, but I thought there is no way . possible I would have two kids with it,' Lisa said. The couple's seven-year-old son does not appear to be affected by the condition. But like Campbell, the girls are battling the condition with positivity and medications that suppress the inflammatory response from arthritis. More than 300,000 children in the United States are living with arthritis, according to the Arthritis Foundation.","Campbell Pruden was diagnosed with arthritis when she was 19-months-old and complained that walking was too painful .

Alcohol prices costs in the UK are higher than most of Europe, new figures revealed today.

And smokers face some of the highest prices in the whole of EU as taxes rise in an attempt to persuade cash-strapped addicts to quit. Cost of living: Milk, eggs, cheese, alcohol and tobacco are all more expensive than the European Average according to a new league table published by the Office for National Statistics . The 2012 league table of food and . drink costs reveals Norway is the most expensive place to shop, followed . by Switzerland and Denmark, the Office for National Statistics said. Across all food and non-alcoholic drinks, the UK pays four per cent above the EU27. Norway has the highest prices at 86 per cent above the average while Macedonia is the lowest  on 42 per cent below. But . alcohol prices in the UK are some of the highest in Europe, some 43 per . cent above the EU27 average, behind only high-cost Scandinavian . countries like Norway, Finland and Sweden., and places like Iceland and . Ireland. Booze: Alcohol prices in the UK were among some of the most expensive in Europe, behind only Scandinavian countries, Iceland and Ireland . Tax: Tobacco costs in the UK are the third highest in Europe, behind only Norway and Ireland, according to the Office for National Statistics . Critics accused the government of driving up costs by increasing duty on beer, wine and spirits. Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said: ‘Huge tax rises are mostly to blame. ‘This is why the successful campaign to abolish the beer duty escalator was so vital. Up until the March Budget, we saw beer duty rise by 42 per cent over four years. ‘Huge amounts of red tape, and other taxes such as business rates, also push up prices.  The industry supports almost one million jobs – and we could be creating many more if tax and red tape weren’t so stifling.’ By comparison, in France alcohol costs are 12 per cent below the average and Germany 18 per cent lower. Food: Overall shopping bills in the UK were 4 per cent above the average, while Norway was the most expensive place in Europe . Dough: The one sign of good news for British shoppers was that bread and cereals were 11 per cent cheaper than the EU average . The cheapest places to buy booze are Macedonia and Bulgaria, where prices are more than a third lower than Europe's average. The new figures show tobacco prices in the UK were 94 per cent above the average last year. Only Norway (170 per cent higher) and Ireland (99 per cent above) were more expensive.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said: 'Our research shows that rising food prices is one of the top worries for financially squeezed consumers, with one in five households already saying they're having to dip into their savings to pay for basics, such as food.' According to latest Which? research, 9.8 million households are feeling the squeeze with 78 per cent of people now worried about food prices. Four in ten people are likely to reduce their spending on groceries and food in the next few months.

Targeted: Cabinet maker Mark Crowther, 51, claims he suffered years of homophobic abuse at the Hands of Wycombe in Buckinghamshire . A skilled cabinet maker was forced out of his job  at a bespoke furniture factory after years of abuse by his 'homophobic' colleagues who branded him a 'queer' and 'bent', an employment tribunal heard today. Mark Crowther, 51, claims he suffered years of homophobic taunts and was then made redundant by the company when he complained about it last year. Mr Crowther, who worked for the Hands of Wycombe in Buckinghamshire for eight years, is now suing the 100-year-old firm  for wrongful dismissal and sexual orientation discrimination. The tribunal heard the entire cabinet making department was branded 'the queer ones' while Mr Crowther was nicknamed 'gay Mark' by colleagues and a supervisor. The skilled cabinet maker was also left notes on his workbench, locker and toolbox, accusing him of being 'bent' and a homosexual. The tribunal judge heard the 'harassment' became so bad that Mr Crowther started taking pictures of the messages in a bid to document the abuse. However, bosses at the factory in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, allegedly ignored his complaints and instead made him redundant last year. One manager was said to have replied 'it's a man's world' when the cabinet maker tried to approach him about his alleged treatment by colleagues. He said: 'I feel I have been harassed by my work colleagues, ignored when I tried to bring it to the attention of the management and because I complained more than once, they felt the easiest way out was by way of unfair selection for redundancy.' The tribunal hearing in Reading, Berkshire, was told the carpenter was nicknamed 'gay Mark' and was subject to ridicule from co-workers. Mr Crowther claimed his supervisor Adrian Walters called him 'gay boy' and 'poofty' and found his obvious discomfort amusing. In September 2010, he said he decided he would start taking pictures of homophobic notes left on his workbench and locker, which were shown to the tribunal panel. At the height of the alleged abuse, Mr Crowther said a male underwear catalogue was placed on his workbench, along with the words 'queer boy', 'gay Mark', and 'I love men' scrawled on masking tape stuck to the desk top. One worker left a piece of wood on his workbench with 'you're gay' carved into it, and a warped piece of wood in the factory's store room had the words 'Bent like Mark' written on it. Bosses at the 100-year-old firm Hands of Wycombe, pictured, denies wrongful dismissal and discrimination . However, Mr Crowther said that he when he tried to complain to his senior manager Robert Smith, he didn't want to know. I went to find Robert Smith and his response was ""it's a man's world"", shrugging his shoulders.' Hands of Wycombe - one of the UK's leading manufacturers of executive office furniture - denies wrongful dismissal and discrimination. The company, founded by renowned chair maker William Hands, has been manufacturing at its High Wycombe factory for more than 100 years. The firm also has a swanky showroom in Islington, north London, from where it supplies boardroom tables and luxury office furniture to major companies. Senior manager Wade Dunford claimed Mr Crowther only raised a grievance about receiving homophobic abuse after he was told that he was to lose his job in a round of redundancies at the company in May last year. Mr Dunford, who is head of design and production at the firm, said he appraised all of the staff fairly before making Mr Crowther redundant and stood by his decision. He said he was 'taken aback' by Mr Clowther's harassment claims and admitted an internal investigation had since exposed a culture of homophobic 'banter' at the firm. Mr Dunford added: 'Mr Walters said that sometimes the drivers would call out ""queer ones"" at the cabinet shop department.' The claimant, he said, was called 'gay Mark' and he had never complained about it - it was all part of the shop floor banter. Mr Walters said he may have called him 'gay Mark' on occasions but not 'poofter' as far as he could recall. Other employees interviewed by Mr Dunsford confirmed Mr Crowther, of Sheepcote Dell Road, Holmer Green, Buckinghamshire, was known as 'Gay Mark' on the shop floor. 'In their view, the name calling was part of banter in the factory, and that it was not just aimed solely at the claimant,' Mr Dunsford said. He added: 'We now understand that the cabinet makers as a whole were called the ""queer ones"" as part of the banter in the factory and that his colleagues had told us that he had shown no sign to them that he objected to this banter including being called ""gay Mark"" over the eight years of employment (with Hands).' Mr Dunford said he was 'surprised' about the nature of the so-called banter, and claimed he hadn't come across it once during his 24 years with the company. he tribunal, before Judge Richard Barrowclough, continues.","Mark Crowther was a cabinet maker for Hands of Wycombe for eight years .

The offspring of the Jolie Pitts, the Burberry-loving Beckham brood and mini clothes horse Suri Cruise get a lot of attention for their designer wardrobes. But there is one tween that blows all other mini-mes out of the water. And there's not a celebrity parent in sight. Five year old Alonso Mateo is very likely the most stylish child the world has ever - and very possibly will ever - encounter. He is all drop crotch pants, dark glasses and Tom Ford pocket squares. And he has 2,500 followers on Instagram, where he shares his catwalk-ready looks with his fans. Alonso Mateo has become an internet style icon after posting photos of his high fashion looks on Instagram . Alonso favours drop-crotch pants and always styles his outfits up with plenty of accessories. His nonchalant poses and photoshoot settings have earned him legions of fans online . In each photo he strikes a confident pose, hand in pocket, gazing off into the distance. The photographs are straight off the fashion pages of Esquire - micro fashion shoots set up on location with palm trees, swimming pool and obligatory dog - dotted with a fair few selfies taken with his iPhone in front of the mirror. Looking at his mother, an equally stylish figure with a penchant for Givenchy and Chanel, it is easy to see where he gets his élan. Luisa Fernanda Espinosa is a freelancer fashion stylist who posts her son's pictures to her own Instagram, where she has 127,000 followers, before they appear on his. Many of Alonso's photos are selfies taken in the mirror with an iPhone . Alonso styles and produces the shoots himself, says his mother . In her line of work she is able to track down the latest looks for Alonso. According to The Cut, she snapped up his favourite All Saints boots in multiple sizes before they discontinued their children's line. She and Alonso also love Gucci and Dior, Stella McCartney, Little Marc Jacobs and Dolce & Gabbana. Alonso's styling is his own doing, though Ms Espinosa says she will sometimes steer him in the right direction if something he chooses doesn't quite work, or is inappropriate for the weather. And when they step outside, his fans often take his picture, although Ms Espinosa says her son will sometimes decline if he is too tired. The pair's shared a love of fashion has allowed Ms Espinosa to bond with her son, and she says she relishes the opportunity to shop together. And Ms Espinosa's work for magazines like Harpers Bazaar and Alonso's father's income as owner and CEO of a . private equity firm allow the family, originally from Monterrey, Mexico but . living in Laguna Beach, sufficient funds to support their shared hobby. Speaking in an interview with Joy Loves Fashion she said her son's favourite things to wear are 'combat boots and sunglasses' and that his recent obsession with bowties saw him going shopping to snap up all the prints that caught his eye. Many of the shoots take place in and around Laguna Beach, California, where the family live after relocating from Monterrey, Mexico, two years ago . Alonso loves shopping - a hobby he shares with his mother Luisa. His recent obsession with bowties saw the two hit the mall hunting for prints he liked .
